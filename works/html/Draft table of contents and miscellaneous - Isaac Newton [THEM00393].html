<p id="par36">The fourth Beast, as he is represented in the Apocalyps,  was conteined in the body of the Dragon for a time, being the waters which the <a id="l72"></a>Dragon cast out of his mouth after the Woman. This was at the divi<a id="l73"></a>sion of the Empire between the sons of Constantine the great. Then the <a id="l74"></a>Earth opened her mouth &amp; swallowed up the waters by the victory of <a id="l75"></a>Constantius over Magnentius, the Earth being put for the nations of Asia <a id="l76"></a>according to the language of the Iews &amp; the waters &amp; Sea for the Isles of <a id="l77"></a>the Sea. By this victory the Beast was wounded to death with a sword in his sixt head, <a id="l78"></a>&amp; then is called the Beast which was &amp; is not. He revived at the next division of the Empire which was between Valentinian &amp; <a id="l79"></a>Valens, &amp; rose out of the sea at the next division which was between Gratian <a id="l80"></a>&amp; Theodosius. &amp; at the death of Theodosius, the Dragon by a final division of the Empire <a id="l81"></a> gave the Beast his Throne &amp; power &amp; great authority.  And hence the Dragon &amp; Beast have common heads &amp; common horns but the  heads are crowned only <a id="l84"></a>upon the Dragon &amp; the horns only upon the Beast  to signify that <a id="l85"></a>the Dragon reigned only in the heads &amp; the Beast only in the horns These horns  grew upon his <a id="l86"></a>last head, which head is called the eighth  &amp; of the seven because a collateral part of <a id="l87"></a>the seventh.</p> 

<p id="par38"> <br><br></p>
<p id="par39">If all the nations which compose these four Beasts that is all within the extent of Sacred Prophesy be divided into three equal <a id="l88"></a>parts the fourth Beast may by accounted one of those parts, the Dragon or third Beast another &amp; the <a id="l89"></a>nations beyond Euphrates or two first Beasts another, &amp; this division seems  referred unto in the Apoca<a id="l90"></a>lyps in mentioning the third part of the Sun Moon &amp; stars, earth sea &amp; rivers.

<p id="par43">The seven heads of the Dragon &amp; Beast are seven Dynasties of the Roman Empire <a id="l94"></a>commencing with the opening of the seven seals.

The seventh is also crowned on the Dragons head because he reigned in the <a id="l97"></a>east after the opening of the seventh seal. And the Beast which was &amp; is not he <a id="l98"></a>is the eighth &amp; of the seven because a collateral part of the seventh. The <a id="l99"></a>nations which composed the ten horns were within the Dominion of the <a id="l100"></a>Dragon before the Beast became divided from him &amp; therefore they are <a id="l101"></a>on the Dragons head, but without crowns because they received no kingdom <a id="l102"></a>before the said division but were to receive power as kings the same hour with the <a id="l103"></a>Beast, that is, presently after the Dragon gave the Beast his  western throne <a id="l104"></a>whence they are crowned only upon the Beast.  The Dragon gave the Beast his western throne at that final division of the Empire between the sons of Theodosius A.C. 395. And the ten horns arose soon after in the following manner.</p>

<p id="par96">The scene of the visions is the Temple. Iohn saw a door opened in heaven which was the <a id="l200"></a>door of the temple, &amp; heard a voice like the sound of a trumpet saying Come up hither &amp; I <a id="l201"></a>will shew thee the things which must be hereafter. And <em class="underline">behold a throne set in heaven</em> upon the Ark <a id="l202"></a>between the Cherubims &amp; one sat on the throne [the Ancient of days] And he that sat was to <a id="l203"></a>look upon like a Iaspar &amp; a Sardine stone [the colour of the people inhabiting Iudea] <a id="l204"></a>And round about the throne [before] were 24 seats, &amp; upon the seats 24 Elders sitting cloathed in <a id="l205"></a>white raiment, &amp; they had on their heads crowns of gold, they being the 24 Princes of the Priests <a id="l206"></a>in their chambers in the priests court. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings &amp; thundring <a id="l207"></a>&amp; voices, the flames of the fire on the altar &amp; the  musick at the sacrifices appearing <a id="l208"></a>such to Iohn who stood at the eastern gate of the Temple, &amp; saw the throne beyond the <a id="l209"></a>fire. And before the throne  was a sea of glass like unto crystal, the brazen sea <a id="l210"></a>filled with water clear as crystall. And in the midst of the throne &amp; in the circle <a id="l211"></a>about the throne, that is before &amp; behind the throne as it were in the middst of it &amp; <a id="l212"></a>on either side of the throne were four Beasts full of eyes before &amp; behind to represent the <a id="l213"></a>multitude of people in the four sides of the great court. In the wilderness where the people <a id="l214"></a>encamped about the tabernacle, the tribes of Iudah Issachar &amp; Zebulum pitched on the east side <a id="l215"></a>under the standard of Iudah which was a lion; the  tribes of Ruben Simeon &amp; Gad pitched on <a id="l216"></a>the south side of the Tabernacle under the standard of Reuben which was a man; the tribes <a id="l217"></a>of Ephraim Manasseh &amp; Benjamin pitched on the west side under the standard of Ephraim <a id="l218"></a>which was an Ox; &amp; the tribes of  Dan Asher &amp; Nepthali pitched on the north side under <a id="l219"></a>the standard of Dan which was a flying eagle. Num 6.11. see also Ezek. I.10 And the four Beasts <a id="l220"></a>had each of them six wings &amp; they were full of eys within to represent multitudes of people <a id="l221"></a>And they rest not day &amp; night [at morning &amp; evening service] saying Holy, holy, holy, <a id="l222"></a>lord God almighty which was &amp; is to come  And when those beasts <a id="l223"></a>give glory &amp; honour &amp; thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever &amp; ever <a id="l224"></a>the ancient of days: the four &amp; twenty elders go into the temple &amp; fall down before him <a id="l225"></a>that sat on the throne, &amp; worship him that liveth for ever &amp; ever &amp; cast their crowns <a id="l226"></a>before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy o Lord to receive glory &amp;  honour <a id="l227"></a>&amp; power: for thou hast created all things &amp; for thy pleasure they are &amp; were created.</p>

<p id="par97">Vpon the first day of the seventh month was the feast of Trumpets &amp; on that day in the morning the High Priest dressed the <a id="l229"></a>lamps  in the temple, &amp; in allusion thereto Iohn hears a great voice as of a trumpet &amp; sees one like the son of man in the <a id="l230"></a>High Priests habit amidst the seven golden candlesticks  dressing the seven <a id="l231"></a>lamps, which appear like a rod of seven starrs in his right hand. And soon after being <a id="l232"></a>called up to the morning sacrifice he saw the book of the scripture of truth sealed with seven seales. in the right hand of him that sat upon <a id="l234"></a>the throne, alluding to the book of the law laid up in the right side of the Ark.  And in allusion to the morning sacrifice he saw also a lamb at the foot <a id="l236"></a>of the altar as it had been slain. And he came &amp; took the book out of the right hand of him <a id="l237"></a>that sat upon the throne. This was in allusion to the High Priests taking the book of the <a id="l238"></a>law from the right side of the Ark annually upon the tenth day of the seventh month <a id="l239"></a>to read it to the people. And when the Lamb had opened the seven seales the seven An<a id="l240"></a>gels receive seven trumpets &amp; sound them  at the great sacrifices upon the seven <a id="l241"></a>days of the feast of Tabernacles.  And at the same sacrifices seven thunders <a id="l242"></a>uttered their voices which are the music of the Temple; And  the seven angels poured <a id="l243"></a>out seven Vials of wrath, which are the drink offerings at the same sacrifices.</p>

<p id="par98">At the opening of the first four seals the four beasts  which <a id="l245"></a>stood in the four sides of the great court call him to come &amp; see, the first calls <a id="l246"></a>him eastward the second westward the third southward &amp; the fourth northward <a id="l247"></a>And at these four calls Iohn saw four men on horsback successively which denote four <a id="l248"></a>dynasties of Roman emperors, the first   from the east Vespasian Titus <a id="l249"></a>&amp; Domitian, the second  from the west Trajan, Adrian, &amp; Antoninus who were <a id="l250"></a>spaniards, the third from the south Severus, Caracalla, Heligabalus, Alexander <a id="l251"></a>Severus, &amp; thre Gordians  who were Africans &amp; Philip an Arabian: &amp; the fourth from the <a id="l252"></a>north Decius,  Valerian, Gallienus, Claudius, Aurelian, Tacitus, Probus. The first <a id="l253"></a>rode upon a white horse,  because of the laudable manners <a id="l254"></a>of Vespasian &amp; Titus; the second on a red horse because of the great wars made by <a id="l255"></a>Trajan; the third on a black horse because of the funerals of many senators &amp; <a id="l256"></a>nobles put to death by Severus: &amp; the fourth on a pale horse because of the sad overthrow <a id="l257"></a>of Decius with his army, &amp; very distracted state of the empire under the 30 tyrants during the <a id="l258"></a>reign of his successors.<br><br></p>
<p id="par99">And when the Lamb had opened the fift seal Iohn saw under the altar the souls of them that <a id="l259"></a>were slain for the word of God &amp; for the testimony which they held: viz<sup>t</sup> in the persecution <a id="l260"></a>of Diocletian which was by far the greatest of all the heathen persecutions &amp; lasted ten <a id="l261"></a>years. And they cried with a loud voice saying: How long o Lord  holy &amp; true dost thou <a id="l262"></a>not judge &amp; avenge our blood on them then that dwell on  the earth? And white <a id="l263"></a>robes were given  unto every one of them, &amp; it was said unto them that they <a id="l264"></a>should rest yet for a little season untill their fellow servants also &amp; their brethren that <a id="l265"></a>should be killed as they were (&amp; chiefly in the great tribulation) should be  fulfilled.</p>

It began to fall at the end of Dioclesi<a id="l274"></a>ans persecution when Constantine the great turned Christian &amp; conquered the persecutors <a id="l275"></a>Maxentius &amp; Maximinus &amp; it continued falling till Iulian the apostate revived it for a <a id="l276"></a>year &amp; eight months. Then it continued falling again till the Emperors rejected the title of Pontifex maxi<a id="l277"></a>mus of the heathens: which put an end to it in the Roman government. And this was at the death of the <a id="l278"></a>Emperors Valentinian &amp; Valens A.C. 378. The the Lamb opened the seventh seal.

I know thy works &amp; thy <a id="l291"></a>labour &amp; thy patience &amp; how thou canst not beare them which are evil: &amp; thou hast <a id="l292"></a>tried them which say they are Apostles &amp; are not [the ringleaders of the Gnosticks &amp; Cataphrygians] &amp; hast found them liars.

<h2 id="hd4" class="cent">Sect. 2. Of the Kingdoms represented by the four Beasts &amp; by the Ram &amp; He-goat.</h2>
<p id="par112">Now according to this language the Lion, Beare Leopard, &amp; terrible Beast <a id="l349"></a>with ten horns in Daniels prophesy of the four Beasts which rose <a id="l350"></a>successively out of the great sea  in four great winds, will signify <a id="l351"></a>four  kingdoms which arose successively by four great <a id="l352"></a>wars. The Lion had eagles wings to denote the Provinces of Babylon <a id="l353"></a>&amp; Assyria of which the first kingdom was composed. By these wings <a id="l354"></a>(untill they were pluckt) it was lifted up from the earth in dominion &amp; made to stand upon its feet like a <a id="l355"></a>man. Then arose the second Beast like to a Beare, the kingdome of <a id="l356"></a>the Persians &amp; Medes. And it raised up it self on one side, the Medes <a id="l357"></a>rising up first. And it had three ribs in the mouth of it between <a id="l358"></a>the teeth of it, the kingdoms of Sardes Babylon &amp; Egypt which were <a id="l359"></a>conquered by it but did not belong to its body. And it devoured much <a id="l360"></a>flesh, the riches of those three kingdoms. Then arose the third <a id="l361"></a>Beast like a Leopard with four heads &amp; four wings to signify that <a id="l362"></a>it should be divided into four kingdoms. This was the Greek Em<a id="l363"></a>pire which conquered the Persian &amp; continued in a monarchical form during the reign of <a id="l364"></a> Alexander the great &amp; his young sons Alexander &amp; Hercules, &amp; <a id="l365"></a>then brake into  four kingdoms  <a id="l367"></a>the governours of provinces Cassander Lysimachus Antigonus &amp; <a id="l368"></a>Ptolomy putting crowns upon their own heads &amp; reigning Cassander over <a id="l369"></a>Macedon Greece &amp; Epire, Lysimachus over Thrace  Antigonus <a id="l370"></a>over Syria &amp; the lesser Asia, &amp; Ptolomy over Egypt Libya &amp; Ethiopia. <a id="l371"></a>And the fourth Beast was the Roman Empire which conquered the <a id="l372"></a>Kingdom of Macedon An. Nabonass. 580, that of Syria An Nabonass 679, <a id="l373"></a>&amp; that of Egypt Anno Nabonas. 718, &amp; by this last conquest was <a id="l374"></a>reduced into a monarchical form &amp; at length brake into ten <a id="l375"></a>kingdoms represented by the ten horns of this Beast &amp; by the ten <a id="l376"></a>toes of the statue of four metals. And this Empire broken into many <a id="l377"></a>kingdoms continued till the Ancient of days sat in a throne like  <a id="l378"></a>fiery flame &amp; the  judgment was set &amp; the books were opened, <a id="l379"></a>&amp; the son of Man came with the clouds of heaven  &amp; was brought <a id="l380"></a>before the ancient of days &amp; received dominion over all nations &amp; <a id="l381"></a>judgment was given to the saints of the most High &amp; the time came that they possessed the <a id="l382"></a>kingdom. And therefore the reign of this Beast is not yet at an end. <span class="ns">☉</span></p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; insertion from f 11v &gt; </span>
<p id="par113"><span class="ns">☉</span> <em class="underline">I beheld</em>, saith Daniel, <em class="underline">till the Beast was slain &amp; his body de<a id="l383"></a>stroyed &amp; given to the burning flame. As concerning the rest of the Beasts <a id="l384"></a>they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged <a id="l385"></a>for a season &amp; a time</em>. And therefore all the four Beasts are still <a id="l386"></a>alive tho the dominion of the  three first be taken away. The nations of <a id="l387"></a>Chaldea &amp; Assyria are still the first Beast. Those of  Media <a id="l388"></a>&amp; Persia are still the second Beast.  Those of Egypt Syria &amp; Asia <a id="l389"></a>minor, Macedon Greece &amp; Thrace are still the third. And those of <a id="l390"></a>Europe on this side Greece are still the fourth. [But the dominion of <a id="l391"></a>the three first is taken away.] Seing therefore that the body of the <a id="l392"></a>third Beast is confined to the nations on this side of the river Euphrates &amp; that the body of the fourth Beast is confined to the nations on this side Greece: We <a id="l393"></a>are to look for the dominion of all the  four heads of the third Beast among the nations on this side of the <a id="l395"></a>river Euphrates &amp; for the dominion of all the  eleven horns of the <a id="l396"></a>fourth Beast among the nations on this side Greece. At the breaking of the <a id="l397"></a>Greek Empire into four kingdoms Seleucus became King of  <a id="l398"></a>Chaldea Media &amp; persia, but his kingdom is not recconed among the  four  <a id="l399"></a>because the nations over which he reigned belonged to the bodies of the two first <a id="l400"></a>Beasts.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 11r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par114">The same thing is represented by the statue of four metals. <a id="l401"></a>the head whereof was of fine gold &amp; represented the kingdom of <a id="l402"></a>Nebuchadnezzar  &amp; the  ten toes represented the  same  kingdom <a id="l403"></a>with the ten horns of the  last Beast. And the stone cut out of the <a id="l404"></a>mountain without hands which fell upon the feet of the Image <a id="l405"></a>&amp; brake the whole to pieces, &amp; became a great mountain &amp; filled <a id="l406"></a>the earth is the kingdom of the saints which reigned over all nations.</p>
<p id="par115">And the second &amp; third kingdoms represented by the Bear <a id="l407"></a>&amp;  Leopard are again represented by the  Ram &amp; He Goat. <em class="underline">The <a id="l408"></a>Ram</em>, saith Daniel,  <em class="underline">having two horns is the kings</em>,  <em class="underline">of Media &amp; Persia</em>, not two persons but the two kingdoms <a id="l410"></a>of Media &amp; Persia united under one Monarch. <em class="underline">And the rough Goat is the King of <a id="l411"></a>Greece</em>, that is the Kingdom. <em class="underline">And the great horn between his eyes <a id="l412"></a>is the first king</em>, not the first monarch but the first Monarchy <a id="l413"></a>of the Greeks which lasted during the reign of Alexander the great <a id="l414"></a>&amp; his two young sons Alexander &amp; Hercules. <em class="underline">Now that</em> [ horn] <a id="l415"></a><em class="underline">being broken; whereas four</em> [horns] <em class="underline">stood up for it, four kingdoms <a id="l416"></a>shall stand up out of the nation</em> [of the Greeks] <em class="underline">but not in his</em> <a id="l417"></a>[the first horns] <em class="underline">power</em>. The four horns are therefore four kingdoms <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span> and by consequence the first great horn which they succeed is the <a id="l418"></a>first great kingdom of the Greeks; that which was founded by Alexan<a id="l419"></a>der   the great An. Nabonass. 414 &amp; lasted till the death of his son Hercules An. <a id="l420"></a>nabonass: 441. <em class="underline">And out of one of</em> the four horns <em class="underline">came forth a little <a id="l421"></a>horn</em>, a little new kingdom of the Greeks. It <em class="underline">waxed <a id="l422"></a>exceeding great towards the south &amp; towards the East &amp; towards the plea<a id="l423"></a>sant land</em> of Iudea, &amp; therefore it arose in the north-west &amp; conquer<a id="l424"></a>ed towards the south &amp; towards the east, &amp; such was the kingdom <a id="l425"></a>of Pergamus. It arose out of the kingdom of Thrace &amp; Phrygia by the revolt <a id="l426"></a>of Philatærus,  who kept the Castel of Pergamus  twenty years &amp; left it to <a id="l427"></a>his brothers sons Eumenes &amp; Attalus the last of which An. Nabonass 507 took from <a id="l428"></a>Callinicus king of Syria almost all Asia on this side mount Taurus &amp; <a id="l429"></a>thereupon was saluted king by his army. <em class="underline">And his power shall be mighty <a id="l430"></a>but not by his own power</em>: which is as much as to say that his power should <a id="l431"></a>be mighty after the dominion of the third beast should be taken away. <a id="l432"></a> That dominion was to be taken away <a id="l433"></a>by the Romans &amp; then the power of this little horn was to become mighty <a id="l434"></a>not by his own but by the power which took away the dominion of the third <a id="l435"></a>Beast which was the power of the Romans. The  Romans inherited the kingdom of Pergamus <a id="l436"></a> by the last will &amp; testament of its  king Attalus II <a id="l437"></a>An. Nabonass. 615. &amp; thence forward the senate of Rome was king of Pergamus <a id="l438"></a>by right of inheritance, &amp; this kingdom by their power <em class="underline">grew mighty toward <a id="l439"></a>the south  &amp; towards the</em>  <em class="underline">east</em>, conquering all the nations <a id="l440"></a>southward &amp; eastward which composed the body of the third Beast <a id="l441"></a>&amp; particularly Armenia Syria  Egypt &amp;  Libya.  And it <em class="underline">grew mighty towards the pleasant <a id="l446"></a>land, &amp; it waxed great even to the host of heaven, &amp; it cast <a id="l447"></a>down some of the Host &amp; of the stars to the grownd &amp; stamped <a id="l448"></a>upon them</em>, conquering  the kingdom of Iudea by the conduct of Pompey An. Nabonass 685 <a id="l449"></a>&amp; thenceforward trampling upon its princes. <em class="underline">Yea he magnified him<a id="l450"></a>self even to the Prince of the Host</em>, the Messiah the King of the <a id="l451"></a>Iews whom he put to death. An. Nabonass. 780. <em class="underline">And by him the daily sacrifice was <a id="l452"></a>taken away &amp; the place of his sanctuary was cast down</em>, viz<sup>t</sup> in <a id="l453"></a>the wars which the  armies of the Greek nations under the conduct of the Romans made against Iudea when <a id="l454"></a> Nero &amp; Vespatian were Emperors. An. Nabonass. 818.</p>
<p id="par116">The kingdoms represented by the second &amp; third Beast are <a id="l455"></a>again described by Daniel in his last Prophesy,  (written in the third year of  Cyrus over Babylon, the year that he conquered Persia,) in the following  <a id="l456"></a>manner. <em class="underline">Behold there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia</em> <a id="l457"></a>[Cyrus, Cambyses, &amp; Darius Hystaspes] <em class="underline">&amp; the fourth</em> [Xerxes] <em class="underline">shall <a id="l458"></a>be far richer then they all: &amp; by his strength &amp; through his <a id="l459"></a>riches he shall stir up all against the Realm of Greece.

<p id="par117">Alexander the great having conquered all the Persian Empire <a id="l466"></a>&amp; some part of India, died at Babylon a month before the summer <a id="l467"></a>solstice in the year of Nabonassar 425; &amp; his capitains gave the monar<a id="l468"></a>
