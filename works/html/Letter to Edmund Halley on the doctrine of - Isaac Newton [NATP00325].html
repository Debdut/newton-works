<span class="pagenumber" id="p055r"> &lt;55r&gt; </span>
<p id="par1" class="i0">Sir</p>
<p id="par2">In order to let you know the case between M<sup>r</sup> Hook &amp; me I gave you an <a id="l1"></a>account of what past between us in our Letters so far as I could remember. For tis long <a id="l2"></a>since they were writ &amp; I do not know that I have seen them since. I am almost con<a id="l3"></a>fident by circumstances that Sir Chr. Wren knew the duplicate proportion when I gave him <a id="l4"></a>a visit, &amp; then M<sup>r</sup> Hook (by his book Cometa written afterward) will prove the last <a id="l5"></a>of us three that knew it. I intended in this Letter to let you understand the case fully <a id="l6"></a>but it being a frivolous business, I shal content my self to give you the heads of it <a id="l7"></a>in short: viz<sup>t</sup> that I never extended the duplicate proportion lower then to the superficies <a id="l8"></a>of the earth &amp; before a certain demonstration I found the last year have suspected <a id="l9"></a>it did not reach accurately enough down so low: &amp; therefore in the doctrine of <a id="l10"></a>projectiles never used it nor considered the motions of the heavens: &amp; consequently <a id="l11"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Hook could not from my Letters which were about Projectiles &amp; the regions de<a id="l12"></a>scending hence to the center conclude me ignorant of the Theory of the Heavens. <a id="l13"></a>That what he told me of the duplicate proportion was erroneous, namely that it <a id="l14"></a>reacht down from hence to the center of the earth. That it is not candid to <a id="l15"></a>require me now to confess my self in print then ignorant of the duplicate pro<a id="l16"></a>portion in the heavens for no other reason but because he had told it me in <a id="l17"></a>the case of projectiles &amp; so upon mistaken grounds accused me of that ignorance. <a id="l18"></a>That in my answer to his first letter I refused his correspondence, told him I had <a id="l19"></a>laid Philosophy aside, sent him only the experiment of Projectiles (rather shortly <a id="l20"></a>hinted then carefully described) in complement to sweeten my Answer, expected <a id="l21"></a>to heare no further from him, could scarce perswade my self to answer his <a id="l22"></a>second letter, did not answer his third, was upon other things, thought no <a id="l23"></a>further of philosophical matters then his letters put me upon it, &amp; therefore <a id="l24"></a>may be allowed not to have had my thoughts of that kind about me so well <a id="l25"></a>at that time. That by the same reason he concludes me then ignorant of <a id="l26"></a>the duplicate proportion he may as well conclude me ignorant of the rest of <a id="l27"></a>that Theory I had read before in his books. That in one of my papers writ <a id="l28"></a>(I cannot say in what year but I am sure some time before I had any <a id="l29"></a>correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg &amp; that's) above fifteen years ago, the proportion <a id="l30"></a>of the forces of the Planets from the Sun reciprocally duplicate to their distan<a id="l31"></a>ces from him is exprest &amp; the proportion of our gravity to the Moon's conatus <a id="l32"></a>recedendi a centro Terræ is calculated thô not accurately enough. That when <a id="l33"></a>Hugenius put out his Horologium Oscillatorium a copy being presented to me; in my letter of <a id="l34"></a>thanks to him I gave those rules in the end thereof a particular commendation <a id="l35"></a>for their usefulness in Philosophy, &amp; added out of my aforesaid paper an in<a id="l36"></a>stance of their usefulness in comparing the forces of the Moon from the earth <a id="l37"></a>&amp; earth from the Sun in determining a Probleme about the Moons phase &amp; putting <a id="l38"></a>a limit to the Sun's parallax. Which shews that I had then my eye upon com<a id="l39"></a>paring the forces of the Planets arising from their circular motion &amp; understoo<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>d<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l40"></a>it: so that a while after when M<sup>r</sup> Hook propounded the Probleme solemnly in <a id="l41"></a>the end of his <em class="underline">Attempt to prove the motion of the earth</em>, if I had not known the <a id="l42"></a>duplicate proportion before I could not but have found it now. Between 10 &amp; <a id="l43"></a>11 years ago there was an Hypothesis of mine registred in your books, wherein I hinted a <a id="l44"></a>cause of gravity towards the earth Sun &amp; Planets with the dependance of the celestial <a id="l45"></a>motions thereon: in which the proportion of the decrease of gravity from the superficies <a id="l46"></a>of the Planet (thô for brevities sake not there exprest) can be no other then re<a id="l47"></a>ciprocally duplicate of the distance from the center. And I hope I shall not be urge<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>d<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l48"></a>to declare in print that I understood not the obvious mathematical conditions of my own Hypothesis. But <a id="l49"></a>grant I received it afterwards from M<sup>r</sup> Hook, yet have I as great a right to it <a id="l50"></a>as to the Ellipsis. For as Kepler knew the Orb to be not circular but oval &amp; guest <a id="l51"></a>it to be Elliptical, so M<sup>r</sup> Hook without knowing what I have found out since his <a id="l52"></a>letters to me, can know no more but that the proportion was duplicate quam proximè <a id="l53"></a>at great distances from the center, &amp; only guest it to be so accurately &amp; guest amiss <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p055v"> &lt;55v&gt; </span> in extending that proportion down to the very center, whereas Kepler guest right at <a id="l54"></a>the Ellipsis. And so M<sup>r</sup> Hook found less of the Proportion then Kepler of the Ellipsis. <a id="l55"></a>There is so strong an objection against the accurateness of this proportion, that without <a id="l56"></a>my Demonstrations, to which M<sup>r</sup> Hook is yet a stranger, it cannot be beleived by a <a id="l57"></a>judicious Philosopher to be any where accurate. And so in stating this business I <a id="l58"></a>do pretend to have done as much for the proportion as for the Ellipsis &amp; to have <a id="l59"></a>as much right to the one from M<sup>r</sup> Hook &amp; all men as to the other from Kepler. <a id="l60"></a>And therefore on this account also he must at least moderate his pretenses.</p>
<br><br>
<p id="par3">The Proof you sent me I like very well. I designed the whole to consist of <a id="l61"></a>three books, the second was finished last summer being short &amp; only wants transcri<a id="l62"></a>bing &amp; drawing the cuts fairly. Some new Propositions I have since thought on <a id="l63"></a>which I can as well let alone. The third wants the Theory of Comets. In Autumn <a id="l64"></a>last I spent two months in calculations to no purpose for want of a good method, <a id="l65"></a>which made me afterwards return to the first Book &amp; enlarge it with divers Propo<a id="l66"></a>sitions some relating to Comets others to other things found out last Winter. The <a id="l67"></a>third I now designe to suppress. Philosophy is such an impertinently litigious <a id="l68"></a>Lady that a man had as good be engaged in Law suits  as have to do with her<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> I found it so formerly &amp; now I no sooner come near her again but she <a id="l69"></a>gives me warning. The two first books without the third will not so well <a id="l70"></a>beare the title of Philosophiæ naturalis Principia Mathematica &amp; therefore I <a id="l71"></a>had altered it to this De motu corporum libri duo: but upon second thoughts I <a id="l72"></a>retain the former title. Twill help the sale of the book which I ought not to diminish <a id="l73"></a>now tis yours. The Articles are with the largest to be called by that name. If you <a id="l74"></a>please you may change the word to <em class="underline">sections</em>, thô it be not material. In the first <a id="l75"></a>page I have struck out the words <em class="underline">uti posthac</em> <em class="underline">docebitur</em> as referring to the third book. <a id="l76"></a>Which is all at present from</p>
<p id="par4" class="i25">Your affectionate friend &amp;</p>
<p id="par5" class="i30">humble Servant</p>
<p id="par6" class="i35">Is: Newton.</p>
<p id="par7" class="i0">Cambridge <a id="l77"></a><br>June 20. 1686.</p>
<br><br>
<p id="par8">Since my writing this letter I am told by one who had it from another <a id="l78"></a>lately present at one of your meetings, how that M<sup>r</sup> Hook should there make a great <a id="l79"></a>stir pretending I had all from him &amp; desiring they would see that he had justice <a id="l80"></a>done him. This carriage towards me is very strange &amp; undeserved, so that I <a id="l81"></a>cannot forbeare in stating that point of justice to tell you further, that he has published Borell's Hypothesis in <a id="l82"></a>his own name &amp; the asserting of this to himself &amp; completing it as his own, seems <a id="l83"></a>to me the ground of all the stir he makes. Borel did something in it &amp; wrote <a id="l84"></a>modestly, he has  done nothing &amp; yet written in such a way as if <a id="l85"></a>he knew &amp; had sufficiently hinted all but what remained to be determined by the <a id="l86"></a>drudgery of calculations &amp; observations, excusing himself from that labour by reason <a id="l87"></a>of his other business: whereas he should rather have excused himself by reason of <a id="l88"></a>his inability. For tis plain by his words he knew not how to go about it. Now <a id="l89"></a>is not this very fine? Mathematicians that find out, settle &amp; do all the business <a id="l90"></a>must content themselves with being nothing but dry calculators &amp; drudges &amp; another <a id="l91"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>that<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> does nothing but pretend &amp; grasp at all things must carry away all the invention <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p055ar"> &lt;55ar&gt; </span> as well of those that were to follow him as of those that went before. Much after <a id="l92"></a>the same manner were his letters writ to me, telling me that gravity in descent <a id="l93"></a>from hence to the center of the earth was reciprocally in a duplicate ratio of the <a id="l94"></a>altitude, that the figure described by projectiles in this region would be an Ellipsis <a id="l95"></a>&amp; that all the motions of the heavens were thus to be accounted for: &amp; this he did <a id="l96"></a>in such a way as if he had found out all &amp; knew it most certainly. And <a id="l97"></a>upon this information I must now acknowledge in print I had all from him &amp; so <a id="l98"></a>did nothing my self but drudge  in calculating demonstrating &amp; writing upon <a id="l99"></a>the inventions of this great man. And yet after all, the first of those three <a id="l100"></a>things he told me is fals &amp; very unphilosophical, the second is as fals &amp; the <a id="l101"></a>third was more then he knew or could affirm me ignorant of by any <a id="l102"></a>thing that past between us in our letters. Nor do I understand by what right he <a id="l103"></a>claims it as his own. For as Borell wrote long before him that by <a id="l104"></a>a tendency of the Planets towards the sun like that of gravity or magnetism <a id="l105"></a>the Planets would move in Ellipses, so Bullialdus wrote that all force re<a id="l106"></a>specting the Sun as its center &amp; depending on matter must be reciprocally <a id="l107"></a>in a duplicate ratio of the distance from the center, &amp; used that very <a id="l108"></a>argument for it by which you, Sir, in the last Transactions have proved <a id="l109"></a>this ratio in gravity. Now if M<sup>r</sup> Hook from this general Proposition in Bul<a id="l110"></a>lialdus might learn the proportion in gravity, why must this proportion here <a id="l111"></a>go for his invention? My letter to Hugenius which I mentioned above was directed to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg <a id="l112"></a>who used to keep the Originals. His papers came into M<sup>r</sup> Hooks possession. M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l113"></a>Hook knowing my hand might have the curiosity to look into that letter &amp; thence <a id="l114"></a>take the notion of comparing the forces of the Planets arising from their circular <a id="l115"></a>motion &amp; so what he wrote to me afterwards about the rate of gravity, might <a id="l116"></a>be nothing but the fruit of my own Garden. And its more then I can affirm that the <a id="l117"></a>duplicate proportion was not exprest in that letter. However he knew it not (as I gather from <a id="l118"></a>his books) till five years after any Mathematician could have told it him. For when <a id="l119"></a>Hugenius had told how to find the force in all cases of circular motion, he <a id="l120"></a>had told them how to do it in this as well as all others. And so the honour of doing <a id="l121"></a>it in this  is due to Hugenius. For another five years after to claim it as his own <a id="l122"></a>invention, is as if some Mechanick who had learnt the Art of surveying from a <a id="l123"></a>Master should afterwards claim the surveying of this or that piece of ground <a id="l124"></a>for his own invention &amp; keep a heavy quarter to be in print for it. But what if <a id="l125"></a>this surveyor be a bungler &amp; give in an erroneous survey? M<sup>r</sup> Hook has erred <a id="l126"></a>in the invention he pretends to &amp; his error is the cause of all the stirr he makes. <a id="l127"></a>For his extending the duplicate proportion down to the center (which I do not) <a id="l128"></a>made him correct me &amp; tell me the rest of his Theory as a new thing to me <a id="l129"></a>&amp; now stand upon it that I had all from that his letter: notwithstanding that <a id="l130"></a>he had told it to all the world before &amp; I had seen it in his printed books <a id="l131"></a>all but the proportion. And why should I record a man for an Invention who <a id="l132"></a>founds his claim upon an error therein &amp; on that score gives me trouble? He <a id="l133"></a>imagins he obliged me by telling me his Theory, but I thought my self disobli<a id="l134"></a>ged by being upon his own mistake corrected magisterially &amp; taught a Theory <a id="l135"></a>which every body knew &amp; I had a truer notion of then himself. Should a man <a id="l136"></a>who thinks himself knowing, &amp; loves to shew it in correcting &amp; instructing others, <a id="l137"></a>come to you when you are busy, &amp; notwithstanding your excuse, press discourses <a id="l138"></a>upon you &amp; through his own mistakes  correct you &amp; multiply discourses &amp; <a id="l139"></a>then make this use of it, to boast that he taught you all he spake &amp; oblige <a id="l140"></a>you to acknowledge it &amp; cry out injury &amp; injustice if you do not, I beleive <a id="l141"></a>you would think him a man of a strange unsociable temper. M<sup>r</sup> Hooks letters <a id="l142"></a>in several respects abounded too much with that humour which Hevelius &amp; others <a id="l143"></a>complain of &amp; therefore he may do well in time to consider whether after this new <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>pro<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>vocation I be much more bound  (in doing him that justice he claims) to make an hon<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ourable<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p055av"> &lt;55av&gt; </span> mention of him in print, especially since this is the third time that he has given <a id="l144"></a>me trouble in this kind.</p>

<p id="par9">For your further satisfaction in this business, I beg the favour you would con<a id="l145"></a>sult your books for a paper of mine entitled, <em class="underline">An Hypothesis explaining the properties of light</em>.

Not far from the beginning there is a Paragraph ending <a id="l147"></a>with these words. <em class="underline">And as the Earth so perhaps may the Sun imbibe this spirit copi<a id="l148"></a>ously to conserve his shining &amp; keep the Planets from receding further from him <a id="l149"></a>&amp; they that will may also suppose that this spirit affords or carries thither the solary <a id="l150"></a>fewel &amp; materiall principle if light: And that the vast ethereal spaces between <a id="l151"></a>us &amp; the stars are for a sufficient repository for this food if the Sun &amp; Planets. <a id="l152"></a>But this if the constitution if ethereal natures by the by</em>. In these &amp; the foregoing <a id="l153"></a>words you have the common cause of gravity towards the earth Sun &amp; all the <a id="l154"></a>Planets, &amp; that by this cause the Planets are kept in their Orbs about the Sun. <a id="l155"></a>And this is all the Philosophy M<sup>r</sup> Hook pretends I had from his letters some <a id="l156"></a>years after, the duplicate proportion only excepted. The preceding words contein <a id="l157"></a>the cause of the phænomena of gravity as we find it on the surface of the earth <a id="l158"></a>without any regard to the various distances from the center: For at first I designed <a id="l159"></a>to write of nothing more. Afterwards, as my manuscript shews, I interlined the <a id="l160"></a>words above cited relating to the heavens, &amp; in so short &amp; transitory an inter<a id="l161"></a>lined hint of things, the expression of the proportion may well be excused. <a id="l162"></a>But if you consider the nature of the Hypothesis you'l find that gravity decreases upward &amp; can be no other <a id="l163"></a>from the superficies of the Planet then reciprocally duplicate of the distance from <a id="l164"></a>the center, but downwards that proportion does not hold. This was but an <a id="l165"></a>Hypothesis &amp; so to be looked upon only as one of my guesses which I did not <a id="l166"></a>rely on: but it sufficiently explains to you why in considering the descent of a <a id="l167"></a>body down to the center I used not the duplicate proportion. In the small <a id="l168"></a>ascent &amp; descent of projectiles above the earth the variation of gravity is so <a id="l169"></a>inconsiderable that Mathematicians neglect it. Hence the vulgar Hypothesis with <a id="l170"></a>them is uniform gravity. And why might not I as a Mathematician use it fre<a id="l171"></a>quently without thinking on the philosophy of the heavens or beleiving it to be <a id="l172"></a>philosophically true?</p>
