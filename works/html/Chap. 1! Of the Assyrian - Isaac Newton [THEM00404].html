<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Chap. 1 <a id="l1"></a>Of the Assyrian Empire</h2>
<p id="par1">Ctesias &amp; the ancient Greek &amp; Latin writers who copy <a id="l2"></a>from him have made the Assyrian Empire as old as that Belus <a id="l3"></a>or Baal who was worshipped in all the east, &amp; Belus as old as <a id="l4"></a>Noah's flood within 60 or 70 years, &amp; tell us the names of all <a id="l5"></a>the kings of Assyria down from his feigned son Ninus to Sar<a id="l6"></a>danapalus the last king of that Monarchy. But the names <a id="l7"></a>of his kings except one or two have no affinity with the names <a id="l8"></a>of the Assyrians mentioned in scripture. For the Assyrians <a id="l9"></a>were usually named after their Gods Bel or  Pul, Chaddon <a id="l10"></a>haddon, Adon or Adonis, Melech or Moloch, Assur, Nebo, <a id="l11"></a>Nergal, Merodach, as in these names Pul, Tiglath-pul-asser, <a id="l12"></a>Salmon-asser, Adra-melech, Shar-asser, Asser-haddon, <a id="l13"></a>Sardanapalus or Assar-adan-pul, Nabon-asser or Nebo–<a id="l14"></a>adon-asser, Bel-adan, Chinil-adan or Chen-el-adan, – <a id="l15"></a>Nebo-pul-asser, Nebu-chadon-asser, Neburaradan or <a id="l16"></a>Nebu-assar-adon, Nergal-asser, Nergal-shar-asser, – <a id="l17"></a>Labo-asser-dach, Shesheb-asser, Beltes-asser, Evil-merodach <a id="l18"></a>Shangar-nebo, Rabsaris or Rab-assar, Nebu-shasban. Such <a id="l19"></a>were the Assyrian names, but those in the Canon of Ctesias <a id="l20"></a>(except Sardanapalus, whose name he had met with in He<a id="l21"></a>rodotus) are of another sort. He makes Semiramis as old <a id="l22"></a>as the first Belus, but Herodotus tells us she was but five <a id="l23"></a>generations older then the mother of Labynitus. He repre<a id="l24"></a>sents that the city Ninus was founded by a man of the <a id="l25"></a>same name &amp; Babylon by Semiramis, whereas Nimrod <a id="l26"></a>or Assur founded those &amp; other cities without giving his own name <a id="l27"></a>to any of them. He makes the Assyrian Empire continue <a id="l28"></a>about 1360 years, whereas Herodotus tells us that it <a id="l29"></a>lasted but 500 years, &amp; the numbers of Herodotus con<a id="l30"></a>cerning those old times are all of them too long. He <a id="l31"></a>makes Nineveh destroyed by the Medes &amp; Babylonians <a id="l32"></a>three hundred years before the reign of Astibares &amp; <a id="l33"></a>Nebuchadnezzar who destroyed it, &amp; sets down the names <a id="l34"></a>of seven or eight feigned kings of Media between the destruc<a id="l35"></a>tion of Nineveh &amp; the reigns of Astibares &amp; Nebuchadnezzar, <a id="l36"></a>as if the monarchy of the Medes erected upon the ruins of <a id="l37"></a>the Assyrian Monarchy had lasted 300 years, whereas it <a id="l38"></a>lasted but 72. And the true Monarchy of the Assyrians <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> described in scripture, whose kings were Pul, Tiglathpulaser <a id="l39"></a>Salmonasser, Senacherib, Asserhaddon, &amp;c. he mentions not, <a id="l40"></a>tho much nearer to his own times: which shews that <a id="l41"></a>he was ignorant of the Antiquities of the Assyrians. <a id="l42"></a>Yet something of truth there is in the bottom of some <a id="l43"></a>of his stories, as that Nineveh was destroyed by the Medes <a id="l44"></a>&amp; Babylonians, that Sardanapalus was the last, or one of <a id="l45"></a>the last kings of Assyria, &amp; that Astibares &amp; Astyages <a id="l46"></a>were kings of the Medes; but he has made all things too <a id="l47"></a>ancient &amp; out of vain glory taken too great a liberty in feigning names <a id="l48"></a>&amp; stories to please his reader.</p>
<p id="par2">When the Iews were newly returned from the <a id="l49"></a>Babylonian Captivity, they confessed their sins in this – <a id="l50"></a>manner, <em class="underline">Now therefore our God – – – let not all the trou<a id="l51"></a>ble seem little before thee which hath come upon us <a id="l52"></a>on our kings, on our Princes, &amp; on our Priests &amp; on our – <a id="l53"></a>Prophets &amp; on our fathers &amp; on all thy people since <a id="l54"></a>the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day</em> (Nehem. <a id="l55"></a>IX. 32) that is since the time of the kingdom of Assyria <a id="l56"></a>or since the rise of that Empire. And therefore the Assy<a id="l57"></a>rian Empire arose when the kings of Assryia began to – <a id="l58"></a>afflict the inhabitants of Palestine,  which was in the days <a id="l59"></a>of Pul. He &amp; his successors afflicted Israel &amp; conquered the nations <a id="l60"></a>round about &amp; upon the ruin of many small &amp; ancient kingdoms <a id="l61"></a>erected their empire, conquering the Medes as well as other nations. <a id="l62"></a>But of those conquests Ctesias knew not a word; no not so <a id="l63"></a>much as the names of the conquerors, or that there was an <a id="l64"></a>Assyrian Empire now standing. For he supposes that the <a id="l65"></a>Medes reigned  at this time &amp; that the Assyrian Empire <a id="l66"></a>was at an end above 250 years before it began.</p>
<p id="par3">However we must allow that Nimrod founded a kingdom  at Babylon &amp; perhaps also in Assyria: &amp; so Cham was king of all Afric &amp; Iaphet of all Europe; <a id="l68"></a>but they left no standing kingdoms, it being the custome of every <a id="l69"></a>father to divide his territories amongst his sons  Nor does it appear that the Kingdom of Nimrod was of any great extent if com<a id="l70"></a>pared with the Empires which rose up afterwards, &amp; after the days of <a id="l71"></a>Nimrod we hear no more of the Assyrians or of Nineve<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>h<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> or Babylon <a id="l72"></a>in scripture till the days of Ionah. In the time of the Iudges of Israel <a id="l73"></a>&amp; reign of David we find Syria &amp; Mesopotamia subject to kings <a id="l74"></a>of other cities (Iud. 3. 8. 2 Sam. 8 &amp; 10.) The kingdoms of Israel, Moab, <a id="l75"></a>Ammon, Edom, Philistia, Sidon, Damascus &amp; Hamath the great continued <a id="l76"></a>subject to other Lords till the reign of Pul &amp; his successors, &amp; so did <a id="l77"></a>the house of Eden (Amos. 1. 5 2 King. 19. 12.) &amp; Haran or Carrhae (Gen. 12. 2 King. 19. 12) <a id="l78"></a>&amp; Sepharvaim  in Mesopotamia &amp; Calneh  neare Bagdad (Gen. X 10. Isa. X. 8 2 King XVII. 31 Sesac &amp; Memnon were great conquerors in the east but in their histories <a id="l79"></a>there's not a word of  an Assyrian  there standing to oppose them They ruffled the – <a id="l80"></a>Eastern nations &amp; put them in arms, which might make those nations <a id="l81"></a>apt to form themselves into bigger &amp; more warlike bodies then <a id="l82"></a>before, &amp; such a body Nineveh with its villages seems to have been <a id="l83"></a>in the days of Ionah. He prophesied when Israel was in affliction under <a id="l84"></a>the king of Syria &amp; this was in the latter part of the reign of Iehoahaz <a id="l85"></a>&amp; first part of the reign of Ioas kings of Israel, &amp; by consequence about <a id="l86"></a>120 years before the captivity of the ten tribes.  Nineveh was then a city of <a id="l87"></a>large extent but full of pastures for cattel so that it conteined but <a id="l88"></a>about 120000 persons. It was returned from captivity (Amos 9.7) &amp; was not yet grown so great &amp; potent as not to be – <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> terrified at the preaching of Ionah &amp; to fear being invaded by <a id="l89"></a>its neighbours &amp; ruined within 40 days. Its king was not yet called <a id="l90"></a>king of Assyria, but only<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> king of Nineveh, &amp; his proclamation for <a id="l91"></a>a fast was not  published in several nations nor in all Assyria <a id="l92"></a>but only in Nineveh &amp; perhaps the villages thereof. But soon after <a id="l93"></a>when the dominion of Nineveh was established at home &amp; ex<a id="l94"></a>alted over all Assryia properly so called &amp; this kingdom began to <a id="l95"></a>make war upon the neighbouring nations, its kings were no longer <a id="l96"></a>called kings of Nineveh but kings of Assyria.</p>
<p id="par4">Amos prophesied in the reign of Ieroboam the son of Ioas king <a id="l97"></a>of Israel soon after Ieroboam had subdued the kingdoms of Da<a id="l98"></a>mascus &amp; Hamath, that is about 70 or 80 years before the captivity <a id="l99"></a>of the ten Tribes; &amp; he thus reproves Israel for being lifted <a id="l100"></a>up by those conquests. <sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> Ye which rejoyce in a thing of nought, which <a id="l101"></a><em class="underline">say, Have we not taken to us horns by our strength? But <a id="l102"></a>behold I will raise up against you a nation, O house of <a id="l103"></a>Israel saith the Lord, and they shall afflict you from the <a id="l104"></a>entring in of Hamath  unto the river of the wilderness.</em> <a id="l105"></a>God here threatens to raise up a nation against Israel, but <a id="l106"></a>what nation he names not. That he conceales till the <a id="l107"></a>Assyrians should appear &amp; discover it. In the prophecies <a id="l108"></a>of Isaiah, Ieremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Micah, Nahum, – <a id="l109"></a>Zephany &amp; Zechary, which were written after this monar<a id="l110"></a>chy grew up, its openly named upon all occasions, but in <a id="l111"></a>this of Amos not once, tho the captivity of Syria &amp; Israel <a id="l112"></a>be the subject of the prophesy &amp; that of Israel be often <a id="l113"></a>threatened. He only saith in general that Syria should go <a id="l114"></a>into captivity unto Kir, &amp; that Israel notwithstanding her <a id="l115"></a>present greatness should go into captivity beyond Damascus, <a id="l116"></a>&amp; that God would raise up a nation to afflict them, meaning <a id="l117"></a>that he would raise up above them  from a lower <a id="l118"></a>condition a nation whom they yet feared not. For so the <a id="l119"></a>Hebrew word מקם signifies when applied to men, as in <a id="l120"></a>Amos 5. 2. 1 Sam. 2. 8. 2 Sam. 12. 11. Psal. 113. 7. Ier. 10. 20 &amp; <a id="l121"></a>50. 32. Hab. 1. 6. Zech. 11. 16. Amos mentions the Assyrians <a id="l122"></a>but once &amp; it is only to tell us that they had been in <a id="l123"></a>captivity. <sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> <em class="underline">Have not I brought up Israel out of the land <a id="l124"></a>of Egypt &amp; the Philistines from Caphtor &amp; the Assyrians <a id="l125"></a>from Kir?</em> They were therefore returned from captivity, &amp; <a id="l126"></a>at the writing of this prophesy made no great figure in <a id="l127"></a>the world, but were to be raised up against Israel, &amp; by <a id="l128"></a>consequence rose up in the days of Pul &amp; his successors. For <a id="l129"></a>after Ieroboam had conquered Damascus &amp; Hamath, his <a id="l130"></a>successor Menahem destroyed Tipsah with its territories upon <a id="l131"></a>Euphrates because in his expedition against Shallum who <a id="l132"></a>usurped the crown they opened not to him. And therefore <a id="l133"></a>Israel continued in its greatness till Pul (probably grown <a id="l134"></a>formidable by some victories) caused Menahem to buy his <a id="l135"></a>peace. Pul therefore reigning presently after the prophesy <a id="l136"></a>of Amos &amp; being the first upon record who began to fulfill it, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> may justly be recconed the first conqueror &amp; founded of that <a id="l137"></a>Empire.</p>
<p id="par5">When Amos prophesied he threatened the  Israelites <a id="l138"></a>with what had lately befallen other kingdoms. <em class="underline">Pass ye</em>, saith he, <sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> <a id="l139"></a><em class="underline">to Calneh &amp; see, &amp; from thence go down to Hamath the great, <a id="l140"></a>then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Be they better then <a id="l141"></a>these kingdoms?</em> But these cities were not yet vanquished <a id="l142"></a>by the Assyrians. Gath was newly vanquished by Vzziah king <a id="l143"></a>of Iudah (2 Chron. XXVI) &amp; Hamath by Ieroboam king of Israel <a id="l144"></a>(2 King. XIV.) and while the Prophet in threatning Israel with <a id="l145"></a>the Assyrians instances in desolations made by other nations <a id="l146"></a>it argues that the Assyrians had not yet made any great <a id="l147"></a>progress in that vast career of victories which we read of a <a id="l148"></a>few years after.  For about seven years after the cap<a id="l149"></a>tivity of the ten Tribes, when Sennachrib warred in Syria <a id="l150"></a>he sent this message to the king of Iudah. <sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> <em class="underline">Behold thou hast <a id="l151"></a>heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by <a id="l152"></a>destroying them utterly, &amp; shalt thou be delivered?

<p id="par16">Asserhadon reigned three years over Egypt &amp; Ethiopia (Isa. 20. <a id="l381"></a>3, 4) &amp; died in the year of Nabonassar 81.

<p id="par17">After the death of Asserhadon reigned at Babylon Saosduchinus, <a id="l394"></a>Chiniladon, Nabopolassar &amp; Nebuchadnezzar,  at Ecbatane Dejoces, <a id="l395"></a>Phraortes, Astyages, Cyaxcres &amp; Darius, &amp; at Nineveh (after a King <a id="l396"></a>whose name is not remembered) I think Nebuchadonosor, Anacyn<a id="l397"></a>daraxis &amp; Sardanapalus. For the history of Nebuchadonosor king <a id="l398"></a>of Assyria suits with these times. For Nebuchadonosor in the 12<sup>th</sup> <a id="l399"></a>year of his reign made war upon Arphanad king of the Medes <a id="l400"></a>&amp; in that war was left alone by a defection of the auxiliary <a id="l401"></a> nations of Cilicia, Damascus, Syria, Phœnicia, Moab, Ammon, <a id="l402"></a>&amp; Egypt, &amp; without their help routed the army of the Medes &amp; <a id="l403"></a>slew Arphaxad in the 17<sup>th</sup> year of his reign as is mentioned in the book of  Iudeth. And <a id="l404"></a>Herodotus tells the same story of a king of Assyria who routed <a id="l405"></a>the Medes &amp; slew their king whom he calls Phraortes, &amp; saith <a id="l406"></a>that in the time of this war the Assyrians were left alone by <a id="l407"></a>the defection of the auxiliary nations, being otherwise in good <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> condition. Arphaxad was therefore the Phraortes of Herodotus <a id="l408"></a>&amp; by consequence was slain in or near the beginning of the reign <a id="l409"></a>of Iosia. For this war was made after Phœnicia, Moab, Ammon, <a id="l410"></a>&amp; Egypt had been conquered &amp; revolted (Iudeth 1. 7, 8, 9) &amp; by consequence after <a id="l411"></a>the reign of Asserhadon who conquered them. It was made <a id="l412"></a>when the Iews were newly returned from captivity &amp; the <a id="l413"></a>vessels &amp; altar &amp; temple were sanctified after the profanation <a id="l414"></a>(Iudeth IV. 3) that is, soon after Manasseh their king had been <a id="l415"></a>carried captive to Babylon by Asserhadon &amp; upon the death <a id="l416"></a>of that king or some other change in the Assyrian Empire <a id="l417"></a>had been released with the Iews from that captivity &amp; had <a id="l418"></a>repaired the altar &amp; restored the sacrifices &amp; worship of the <a id="l419"></a>temple,(2 Chron. XXXII. 11, 13, 16.)</p>
<p id="par18">After this war Nebuchadonosor king of Assyria in the <a id="l420"></a>18<sup>th</sup> year of his reign sent his captain Olofernes with a <a id="l421"></a>great army  to avenge himself on all the west country be<a id="l422"></a>cause they had  disobeyed his commandment: &amp; Olofernes <a id="l423"></a>went forth with an army of 12000 horse &amp; 120000 foot of Assyrians Medes &amp; Persians &amp; <a id="l424"></a>reduced Cilicia &amp; Mesopotamia &amp; Syria &amp; Damascus &amp; part <a id="l425"></a>of Arabia &amp; Ammon &amp; Edom &amp; Modian &amp; then came against Iudæa. And this <a id="l426"></a>was done when  the government was in the hands of <a id="l427"></a>the High Priest &amp; Ancients of Israel (Iudeth IV. 8 &amp; VII. 23) &amp; by <a id="l428"></a>consequence when Iosiah was a child. In times of prosperity <a id="l429"></a>the children of Israel were apt to go after fals Gods, &amp; in <a id="l430"></a>times of affliction to repent &amp; return to the Lord. So Manasses <a id="l431"></a>a very wicked king being captivated by the Assyrians repented <a id="l432"></a>&amp; being released from captivity restored the worship of the true <a id="l433"></a>God. And so when we are told that Iosiah in the eighth year <a id="l434"></a>of his reign, while he was yet young began to seek after the <a id="l435"></a> God of David his father (2 Chron. XXXIV. 3) &amp; in the twelft <a id="l436"></a>year of his reign began to purge Iudah &amp; Ierusalem from <a id="l437"></a>Idolatry &amp; to destroy the high places &amp; groves &amp; altars &amp; Images <a id="l438"></a>of Baalim, we may understand that these acts of religion were <a id="l439"></a>occasioned by impending dangers &amp; escapes from dangers. When <a id="l440"></a>Olofernes came against the western nations &amp; spoiled them, then were the <a id="l441"></a>Iews terrified, &amp; they fortified Iudea &amp; cried unto God with <a id="l442"></a>great fervency &amp; humbled themselves in sackcloth &amp; put ashes <a id="l443"></a>on their heads &amp; cried unto the God of Israel that he would <a id="l444"></a>not give their wives &amp; their children &amp;  cities for a <a id="l445"></a>prey &amp; the Temple for a profanation; &amp; the High Priest, &amp; all <a id="l446"></a>the Priests put on sackcloth &amp; ashes &amp; offered dayly burnt offerings <a id="l447"></a>with vows &amp; free gifts of the people (Iudeth IV) &amp; then began <a id="l448"></a>Iosiah to seek after the God of his father David. And after <a id="l449"></a>Iudeth had slain Olofernes, &amp; the Assyrians were fled, &amp; the <a id="l450"></a>Iews who pursued them were returned to Ierusalem,  <a id="l451"></a>they worshipped the Lord &amp; offered burnt offerings &amp; free offerings <a id="l452"></a>&amp; gifts &amp; continued feasting before the sanctuary for the space <a id="l453"></a>of three months (Iudeth XVI. 18) &amp; then did Iosiah purge Iudah <a id="l454"></a>&amp; Ierusalem from Idolatry. Whence it seems to me that the 18<sup>th</sup> year of  Nebuchadonosar fell in with the <a id="l455"></a>8<sup>th</sup> of Iosiah.</p>
<p id="par19">At that time the Scythians  under Madyas or Nedus invaded Media &amp; <sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup> <a id="l457"></a>beat the Medes in battel &amp; went thence towards Egypt, but were met in Phœnicia by Psam<a id="l458"></a>miticus &amp; bought off, &amp; returning reigned over a great part of <a id="l459"></a>Asia, but in the end of about 28 years were many of them slain in <a id="l460"></a> a feast by the Medes under the conduct of Cyaxeres <a id="l461"></a>just before the destruction of Nineveh, &amp; the rest fled, I think, to their brethren <a id="l462"></a>in Parthia.</p>

For Nabopolassar <a id="l472"></a>married his son Nebuchadnezzar to Amyite the daughter of <a id="l473"></a>Astyages. And by this marriage having contracted affinity, <a id="l474"></a>they conspired against the Assyrians, &amp; being old, their sons <a id="l475"></a>Nebuchadnezzar &amp; Cyaneres led the armies of the two nations <a id="l476"></a>against Nineveh, caused Sardanapalus to burn himself in his <a id="l477"></a>palace, destroyed the city &amp; shared the kingdome of the <a id="l478"></a>Assyrians. This victory the Iews refer to the Chaldeans, <a id="l479"></a>the Greeks to the Medes, Tobit Polyhistor Iosephus &amp; Ctesias <a id="l480"></a>to both.

And thence the time of <a id="l484"></a>the fall of the Assyrian Empire is determined the conquerors <a id="l485"></a>being then in their youth. In the reign of Iosiah when <a id="l486"></a>Zephany prophesied, Nineveh &amp; the kingdom of Assyria <a id="l487"></a>were standing, &amp; their fall was prædicted by that Prophet. <a id="l488"></a>(Zeph.

XXIV. 7  Ier. <a id="l500"></a>XLVI. 2. Eupolemus apud Euseb. Præp. l. 9. c. 39.) And there<a id="l501"></a>fore we cannot err above a year if we refer the destruction <a id="l502"></a>of Nineveh &amp; the fall of the Assyrian Empire to the second <a id="l503"></a>year of Iehojakim, Anno Nabonass. 140.</p>
