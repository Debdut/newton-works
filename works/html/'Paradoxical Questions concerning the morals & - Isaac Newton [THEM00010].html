<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Paradoxical Questions <a id="l1"></a><br>concerning the morals &amp; actions of Athanasius <a id="l2"></a>&amp; his followers.</h2>
<div>
<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">Quest. 1. <a id="l3"></a><br>Whether the ignominious death of Arius in a <a id="l4"></a>bog-house was not a  story feigned &amp; put about by Athanasius above <a id="l5"></a>twenty years after his death.</h2>
<p id="par1">How Arius died I reccon a question of no  <a id="l6"></a>moment, but because it leads to other things of moment <a id="l7"></a>I chuse to begin with it. We are told in history that <a id="l8"></a>he was excommunicated by the council of Nice &amp; <a id="l9"></a>banished by the Emperor Constantine the great, &amp; some <a id="l10"></a>time after released out of banishment by the same <a id="l11"></a>Emperor, &amp; that he died at Constantinople in a bog-<a id="l12"></a>house miserably by the  effusion of his bowels the day <a id="l13"></a>before he was to have been absolved from excommuni<a id="l14"></a>cation. Now this story of his death was not spread <a id="l15"></a>abroad till about 24 years after his death, &amp; then it <a id="l16"></a>was first vented by his greatest enemy Athanasius in <a id="l17"></a>a clandestine way. For Athanasius in the end of the <a id="l18"></a>reign of Constantius being forced to retire from his <a id="l19"></a>bishopric into the wilderness of Egypt, broached that <a id="l20"></a>story there by sending about a narrative of it in <a id="l21"></a>a timorous &amp; cautious manner, charging them not <a id="l22"></a>to transcribe it but to return it back to him so <a id="l23"></a>soon as they had read it. And this appears by a <a id="l24"></a>letter which he sent about at the same time to <a id="l25"></a>those Moncks in which he writes thus. For the full <a id="l26"></a>condemnation &amp; rejection of the heresy of the Arians <a id="l27"></a>ye are to beleive that the judgment of God in the <a id="l28"></a>death of Arius is sufficient, which ye have even now <a id="l29"></a>learnt from others. For what God has constituted <a id="l30"></a>let no man annull, &amp; whom he has condemned <a id="l31"></a>who shall pronounce just. For who from so great <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span> a signe knows not that this heresy is hated of God <a id="l32"></a>notwithstanding that it is defended by men. When <a id="l33"></a>therefore you have read it, pray for us &amp; exhort <a id="l34"></a>one another to it &amp; straight way send back those <a id="l35"></a>things to us &amp; publish no copy thereof nor transcribe <a id="l36"></a>any for your selves, but be ye content as just usu<a id="l37"></a>rers with the bare reading of it altho ye may desire <a id="l38"></a>to read it often. <sup>✝</sup> ffor it is not safe that those our write<a id="l39"></a>ings should come to posterity which we composed as bablers <a id="l40"></a>&amp; unlearned. Thus far Athanasius. In this epistle <a id="l41"></a>he mentions his own flight &amp; the placing of George <a id="l42"></a>in the chair of Alexandria which happened A.C. 356. He <a id="l43"></a>mentions also the subscription of Liberius A.C. 358 &amp; <a id="l44"></a>both the lapse &amp; death of Hosius the first of which <a id="l45"></a>happened at Sirmium A.C. 357, &amp; the last in or after <a id="l46"></a>the Council of Ariminum as Baronius proves: &amp; there<a id="l47"></a>fore this epistle was written between the Council of <a id="l48"></a>Ariminum &amp; death of Constantius &amp; by consequence <a id="l49"></a>A.C. 359 or soon after: that is 24 years after the <a id="l50"></a>ignominious death of Arius or above. For he died <a id="l51"></a>according to the relation of Athanasius before the Coun<a id="l52"></a>cil of Tyre which met A.C. <em class="underline">355</em>,<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> or according to the rela<a id="l53"></a>tion of the ecclesiastical historians soon after: &amp; the <a id="l54"></a>Council of Ariminum sat A.C. 359.</p>
<p id="par2">Now at the same time that this libel or narrative <a id="l55"></a>of the death of <em class="underline">Athanasius</em><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> went about  in the wilder<a id="l56"></a>ness among the Moncks, one Serapion upon a dispute whe<a id="l57"></a>ther Arius died in communion with the Church wrote to <a id="l58"></a>Athanasius to know his opinion about it: to whom <a id="l59"></a>Athanasius returned this answer.<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> I have read the <a id="l60"></a>letters of your Reverence in which you desire that <a id="l61"></a> I would write to you those things which are at this <a id="l62"></a>time done against me, &amp; concerning the wicked Heresy <a id="l63"></a>of the Arians by which we suffer these things, &amp; how <a id="l64"></a>Arius ended his life. Two of these three requests I <a id="l65"></a>have willingly performed &amp; sent to your piety what I <a id="l66"></a>have written to the Moncks. ffor thence you may <a id="l67"></a>learn what relates both to our troubles &amp; to the <a id="l68"></a>heresy. But concerning the third head, namely the <a id="l69"></a>death of Arius, I much doubted with my self about <a id="l70"></a>it fearing least in doing it, I should seem to insult <a id="l71"></a>over the death of the man. But yet because a dis<a id="l72"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span>putation amongst you concerning the  heresy <a id="l73"></a>ended in this question, Whether Arius died in communion <a id="l74"></a>with the Church: for ending the dispute about his <a id="l75"></a>death I will tell you the truth, accounting it the <a id="l76"></a>same thing to tell this as to end the contention <a id="l77"></a>ffor I perswade my self that the miracle of his <a id="l78"></a>death being known, it will no longer be doubted <a id="l79"></a>whether the Arian heresy be odious to God or not <a id="l80"></a>Truly I was not at Constantinople when he died <a id="l81"></a>but Macarius the Presbyter was there &amp; I learnt <a id="l82"></a>it by his relation. –– Arius by the endeavour <a id="l83"></a>of the Eusebians being called to the Emperor <a id="l84"></a>Constantine &amp; at his entrance being asked by <a id="l85"></a>the Emperor, if he kept the faith of the Catho<a id="l86"></a>lick Church, affirmed upon oath, that he beleived <a id="l87"></a>aright, suppressing what he had been excom<a id="l88"></a>municated for by Alexander his bishop &amp; colour<a id="l89"></a>ing over his profession with scripture expressions. <a id="l90"></a>When therefore he had sworn that he had done <a id="l91"></a>none of those things for which he  was by Alex<a id="l92"></a>ander excommunicated, the Emperor dismist him <a id="l93"></a>with these words. If thy faith be right thou hast <a id="l94"></a>well sworn, but if impious &amp; yet thou hast sworn <a id="l95"></a>God will condemn thee for thy oath. <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> Him therefore <a id="l96"></a>thus departing from the Emperor, the Eusebians <a id="l97"></a>by their usual force would have introduced into <a id="l98"></a>the Church, but Alexander bishop of Constantino<a id="l99"></a>ple contradicted it, saying that the inventor of a <a id="l100"></a>heresy ought not to be received into commu<a id="l101"></a>nion. Then the Eusebians threatned saying, As we <a id="l102"></a>have procured against your will that he should <a id="l103"></a>be called by the Emperor so to morrow notwith<a id="l104"></a>standing tis against your mind we will bring Arius <a id="l105"></a>into communion with us in this Church. It was <a id="l106"></a>the Sabbath [that is Satturday] when they said this <a id="l107"></a>Which Alexander hearing &amp; being much troubled <a id="l108"></a>he went into the Church, &amp; lifting up his hands <a id="l109"></a>to God lamented &amp; falling upon his face on the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002v"> &lt;2v&gt; </span> grownd prayed. Macarius was there present praying with <a id="l110"></a>him &amp; hearing his words. Now he requested one of <a id="l111"></a>these things. If Arius, saith he, must to morrow be <a id="l112"></a>brought into the congregation, let thy servant now <a id="l113"></a>depart &amp; destroy not the righteous with the wicked, but <a id="l114"></a>if thou wilt spare thy Church (for I know thou <a id="l115"></a>wilt spare it) look upon the words of the Eusebians <a id="l116"></a>&amp; give not thy inheritance into destruction &amp; disgrace <a id="l117"></a>&amp; <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> take away Arius least he being received into the <a id="l118"></a>Church his heresy may seem also to be received <a id="l119"></a>with him &amp; so impiety be counted for piety. The <a id="l120"></a>Bishop having thus prayed went thence very thought<a id="l121"></a>full &amp; there followed a thing wonderfull &amp;  incredible. For the Eusebians threatning the <a id="l123"></a>Bishop prayed: but Arius confiding in the Eusebians <a id="l124"></a>&amp; prating much went into a bog-house as if to ease <a id="l125"></a>himself &amp; <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> suddenly (as tis written) falling head long <a id="l126"></a>burst in sunder &amp; died upon the ground being deprived <a id="l127"></a>both of communion &amp; life. Such was the end of <a id="l128"></a>Arius. And the Eusebians being greatly ashamed <a id="l129"></a>buried their fellow conspirator: but the Church <a id="l130"></a>rejoycing Alexander celebrated the communion in <a id="l131"></a>piety &amp; sound faith with all the brethren praying <a id="l132"></a>&amp; greatly glorifying God: not as if he rejoyced at <a id="l133"></a>his death (far be it, for it is appointed all men <a id="l134"></a>once to dy,) but because this thing appeard above <a id="l135"></a>all humane judgment. ffor the Lord himself judg<a id="l136"></a>ing between the threatnings of the Eusebians, &amp; the <a id="l137"></a>prayer of Alexander, condemned the Arian heresy, <a id="l138"></a>shewing it unworthy of the communion of the Church <a id="l139"></a>&amp; manifesting to all men that althô it be counte<a id="l140"></a>nanced by the Emperor &amp; by all mortalls yet tis <a id="l141"></a>condemned by the Church. ––– Certainly many <a id="l142"></a>of those who were deceived before were converted, <a id="l143"></a>namely because God himself had condemned the <a id="l144"></a>heresy &amp; shewn it to be incommunicable to the Church. <a id="l145"></a>Wherefore let the Question cease among you. To them <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">who moved this question let this be read together <a id="l146"></a>with what I wrote in briefe to the Moncks con<a id="l147"></a>cerning this heresy, that they being thence instructed <a id="l148"></a>may more &amp; more condemn it. But let no copy <a id="l149"></a>of these things be transcribed nor transcribe any <a id="l150"></a>for your self. ffor this I have also enjoyned the<a id="l151"></a>Moncks. But according to your candour if any thing <a id="l152"></a>be wanting in the writings add it &amp; streight way <a id="l153"></a>return them to us,</em> &amp;c. Thus far Athanasius. So <a id="l154"></a>then the story of Arius's death was first broached <a id="l155"></a>by Athanasius at that time when Arianism was <a id="l156"></a>countenanced by the Emperor &amp; by all mortals, &amp; by <a id="l157"></a>consequence after the compliance of the western <a id="l158"></a>Bishops in the Council of Ariminum; &amp; Athanasius <a id="l159"></a>pretended no other author for it then Macarius a dead <a id="l160"></a>man, &amp; propounded it amongst his  ignorant <a id="l161"></a>&amp; credulous Moncks with much timorousness, charging <a id="l162"></a>them to return the writings quickly to him, without <a id="l163"></a>letting any copies be taken least it should at length <a id="l164"></a>get into such hands as he could not trust. ffor, <a id="l165"></a>saith he, it is not safe that it should come to pos<a id="l166"></a>terity. But a while after when the story was <a id="l167"></a>once spread abroad, so that he might tell it with<a id="l168"></a>out danger of being reputed it's author, he tells it <a id="l169"></a>again in his first Oration without any such caution.<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup></p>
<p id="par3">Now the reasons which make me suspect the truth of this story are these.</p>
<p id="par4">1. Because the prayer of Macarius is contrary <a id="l170"></a>to the temper &amp; spirit of true Christianity, &amp; it is <a id="l171"></a>not likely that God would heare a wicked prayer</p>
<p id="par5">2. Because the story came to us not from Con<a id="l172"></a>stantinople as it ought to have done, but from Egypt <a id="l173"></a>&amp; was not broached there till 24 years after the <a id="l174"></a>death of Arius or above. Athanasius &amp; the Bish<a id="l175"></a>ops of Egypt when collected in a Council at <a id="l176"></a>Alexandria five years after the Council of Tyre <a id="l177"></a>knew nothing of it, as you may perceive by the <a id="l178"></a>letter which that Council wrote in defence of  <a id="l179"></a>Athanasius against Arius &amp; the Council of Tyre. Nor <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003v"> &lt;3v&gt; </span> did Iulius Bishop of Rome know any thing of it whe<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>n<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l180"></a>he wrote in defence of Athanasius. Nor did the Coun<a id="l181"></a>cil of Sardica (where Athanasius &amp; his friends were <a id="l182"></a>assembled together out of all the Empire) know any <a id="l183"></a>thing of it as you may perceive by their letters. <a id="l184"></a>Athanasius long after these times told it as a secret <a id="l185"></a>&amp; out of his writings the Ecclesiastical historians <a id="l186"></a>have propagated it to posterity.</p>
<p id="par6">3. Because it was broached &amp; spread abroad by <a id="l187"></a>the grand enemy of Arius without any pretence <a id="l188"></a>of proof or other evidence then the credit of the <a id="l189"></a>reporter. ffor detracting stories never look well <a id="l190"></a>when told by profest enemies. Such a person may <a id="l191"></a>be an accuser but not a witness, &amp; accusations <a id="l192"></a>without proof are by the general rule of all courts <a id="l193"></a>of justice to be accounted calumnies.</p>
<p id="par7">4 Because Athanasius broached it as he con<a id="l194"></a>fesseth, to blast the name &amp; religion of his ene<a id="l195"></a>mies, &amp; that at a point of time when he was <a id="l196"></a>reduced to the greatest despare</p>
<p id="par8">5 Because he broacht it in a clandestine way <a id="l197"></a>in the wilderness amongst the Moncks of his own party <a id="l198"></a>who were ignorant of affairs of the world &amp; depended <a id="l199"></a>on his mouth as on an oracle: &amp; also because he <a id="l200"></a>was fearfull least the writings by which he broacht <a id="l201"></a>it should come into other hands which he could <a id="l202"></a>not trust, or remain upon record. For, saith he, <a id="l203"></a>tis not safe that they should come to posterity</p>
<p id="par9">6 Because the story after he had broached <a id="l204"></a>it spread but slowly, being not generally known <a id="l205"></a>till the ecclesiastical historians about ninety years <a id="l206"></a>after the death of Arius set it down in their <a id="l207"></a>histories as <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> Theodoret informs us.  Sulpi<a id="l208"></a>cius Severus who wrote his history above <a id="l209"></a>thirty years after knew nothing of it,  <a id="l211"></a>It seems to have made little noise in the <a id="l212"></a>world before the Greek Historians met with it <a id="l213"></a>in the writings of Athanasius &amp; put it about.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span>
<p id="par10">7. And tho it came originally from Egypt &amp; was not <a id="l214"></a>known  in the world till about 24 years after <a id="l215"></a>the death of Arius, yet Athanasius to give credit to it amongst <a id="l216"></a>the Egyptian Moncks, told it then &amp; there as if it had <a id="l217"></a>been well known at Constantinople from the beginning <a id="l218"></a>saying that at the ignominious death of Arius the Euse<a id="l219"></a>bians were ashamed &amp; many of them were converted <a id="l220"></a>&amp; the Church rejoyced greatly. ffor how it could be <a id="l221"></a>so publickly known there at first, &amp; not spread thence <a id="l222"></a>into Egypt &amp; other regions before Athanasius told it <a id="l223"></a>I understand not.</p>
<p id="par11">Lastly the  main designe of the story is to repre<a id="l224"></a>sent that Arius died miserably without the pale of <a id="l225"></a>the Church, &amp;  for that end Athanasius in his letter <a id="l226"></a>to Serapion represents as if he died at Constantinople <a id="l227"></a>immediately after he was recalled thither from ba<a id="l228"></a>nishment before the Eusebians had time enough to <a id="l229"></a>receive him into communion. And in his letter to <a id="l230"></a>the Moncks when he had mentioned the ignomi<a id="l231"></a>nious death of Arius he subjoyns that the Euse<a id="l232"></a>bians not very long after accomplished what they <a id="l233"></a>had been endeavouring at Constantinople,  re<a id="l234"></a>ceiving the Arians into communion (meaning at <a id="l235"></a>Ierusalem) &amp; pretending the Emperors command <a id="l236"></a>&amp; not blushing after the deposition of Athanasius <a id="l237"></a>to write in their letters (that is, in a letter of the <a id="l238"></a>Council of Ierusalem to Alexandria) that envy <a id="l239"></a>was ceased &amp; that they had received the Arians <a id="l240"></a>&amp; boasted the Emperors command for it, not fearing <a id="l241"></a>to add that the faith of the Arians was right. Thus <a id="l242"></a>does Athanasius in these his two letters that he <a id="l243"></a>may make Arius dye  without the pale of the Church, <a id="l244"></a>place his death at Constantinople before the <a id="l245"></a>Arians were received at Ierusalem. And yet its <a id="l246"></a>certain that Arius went from Constantinople to <a id="l247"></a>Tyre &amp; Ierusalem &amp; Alexandria before he died <a id="l248"></a>&amp; was one of those whome the Council of Ieru<a id="l249"></a>salem received into communion. ffor Constantine <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004v"> &lt;4v&gt; </span> the great recalled him &amp; Euzoius together from banishment <a id="l250"></a>&amp; after he had allowed their profession of faith, sent them <a id="l251"></a>to the Council of Tyre to be received into communion, &amp; that <a id="l252"></a>Council (which Eusebius represents a greater Council then <a id="l253"></a>that of Nice) removing to Ierusalem received them there <a id="l254"></a>&amp; sent them with a recommendatory letter to Alexan<a id="l255"></a>dria to be readmitted to their places. This story is told <a id="l256"></a>not only by the Ecclesiastical <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> Historians but also by <a id="l257"></a>the Council it self in that letter &amp; by the Bishops <a id="l258"></a>of that Council met again in the Council of Antioch <a id="l259"></a>where they write that they being judges of the faith <a id="l260"></a>of Arius had received him rather then followed him <a id="l261"></a>Tis acknowledged also by Athanasius himself in his <a id="l262"></a>book de Synodis Arimini et Seleuciæ where he recites <a id="l263"></a>the letter of the Council of Ierusalem &amp; then adds <a id="l264"></a>that that Council <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> after the banishment of Athana<a id="l265"></a>sius wrote in this letter to Alexandria, that they <a id="l266"></a>should receive Arius &amp; those that were with him. <a id="l267"></a>And the memory &amp; tradition of his reception at Tyre <a id="l268"></a>remained in Egypt till Athanasius by a contrary <a id="l269"></a>story extinguished it as is manifest by the opposition <a id="l270"></a>that the story of the death of Arius met with at first <a id="l271"></a>some disputing that he died in communion till Atha<a id="l272"></a>nasius commanded them silence. Historians therefore <a id="l273"></a>finding that Arius was certainly received at Tyre &amp; went <a id="l274"></a>thence to Alexandria have endeavoured to mend the <a id="l275"></a>narrative of Athanasius by placing the death of Arius <a id="l276"></a>not immediately after his return from banishment to <a id="l277"></a>Constantinople as Athanasius doth but after his return <a id="l278"></a>from Alexandria thither. And yet to allow, as they do, <a id="l279"></a>that Arius was received into communion  at Ie<a id="l280"></a>rusalem &amp; by consequence died within the pale of <a id="l281"></a>the Church is contrary to the designe of the story. And <a id="l282"></a>to tell that the Eusebians after they had received <a id="l283"></a>him at Ierusalem, would have received him at Con<a id="l284"></a>stantinople as if they had not received him before is <a id="l285"></a>contrary not only to the narrative of Athanasius but <a id="l286"></a>also to common sense. ffrom one excommunication there <a id="l287"></a>is but one absolution.</p>
<p id="par12">These are the reasons which incline me to suspect <a id="l288"></a> the story of the death of Arius. And whilst <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> Athanasius wrote his book de Synodis Arimini et <a id="l289"></a>Seleuciæ long after the death of Macarius &amp; <a id="l290"></a>therein relates the reception of Arius at Ieru<a id="l291"></a>salem: I suspect also that he knew nothing then <a id="l292"></a>of the story of Arius dying  out of com<a id="l293"></a>munion &amp; therefore had it not from Macarius <a id="l294"></a>as he pretends, but invented it himself.</p>

<h2 id="hd3" class="cent">Quest. 2. <a id="l295"></a><br>Whether the Meletians deserved <a id="l296"></a>that ill character which Athanasius gave them.</h2>
<p id="par13">In Dioclesian's persecution there arose a controversy <a id="l297"></a>between Peter the Bishop of Alexandria &amp; Meletius <a id="l298"></a>the first of the Bishops under him; which caused <a id="l299"></a>a schism in the churches of Egypt; both parties <a id="l300"></a>notwithstanding keeping communion with the Chur<a id="l301"></a>ches abroad. When Athanasius succeeded in the <a id="l302"></a>Bishoprick of Alexandria, he was accused of ty<a id="l303"></a>rannical behaviour towards the Meletians so as in <a id="l304"></a>the time of the sacrament to break the communion <a id="l305"></a>cup of one Ichyras a Meletian Presbyter in Ma<a id="l306"></a>reote &amp; subvert the communion table &amp; cause the <a id="l307"></a>church to be speedily demolished, &amp; some time after <a id="l308"></a>to kill Arsenius a Bishop the successor of Meletius <a id="l309"></a>in Hypselita. Whereupon the Meletians accusing <a id="l310"></a>Athanasius of these things, he was tryed &amp; con<a id="l311"></a>demned in the Council of Tyre &amp; banished by the <a id="l312"></a>Emperor Constantine the great. And this caused <a id="l313"></a>great enmity between Athanasius &amp; the Meletians. <a id="l314"></a>Athanasius therefore in his second Apology<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> gives this <a id="l315"></a>character of Meletius, that he was by Peter the <a id="l316"></a>Bishop of Alexandria in a common synod of the <a id="l317"></a>Bishops convicted of many crimes, &amp; particularly <a id="l318"></a>that he had sacrificed to idols &amp; for these things <a id="l319"></a>deposed: &amp; that he thereupon made a schism so that <a id="l320"></a>his followers instead of  Christians were called  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005v"> &lt;5v&gt; </span> Meletians. But Epiphanius<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> relates the original of the schi<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>sm<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l321"></a>much otherwise. ffor he calls Meletius a Confessor, &amp; <a id="l322"></a> saith that when he &amp; Peter &amp; other martyrs &amp; <a id="l323"></a>Confessors were in prison together there arose a dispute <a id="l324"></a>about the reception of lapsed persons, Peter out of mercy <a id="l325"></a>being for a speedy reception &amp; Meletius &amp; Peleus &amp; <a id="l326"></a>many other martyrs &amp; confessors out of zeal for piety <a id="l327"></a>being for a competent time of penitence before they <a id="l328"></a>were received so that the sincerity of their penitence <a id="l329"></a>might first appear: &amp; thereupon they divided; the <a id="l330"></a>greater part following Meletius. Afterwards Peter <a id="l331"></a>suffered martyrdome, &amp; Meletius for some time was <a id="l332"></a>condemned to the mines. Thus Epiphanius.</p>
<p id="par14">Now that which makes me suspect the relation <a id="l333"></a>of Athanasius is first because the character given <a id="l334"></a>by the greatest enemy is always the most to be <a id="l335"></a>suspected &amp; then because the Council of Nice did <a id="l336"></a>not receive Meletius &amp; his party into communion as <a id="l337"></a>they would have done had they been excommunicate <a id="l338"></a>before, but without any absolution continued them in <a id="l339"></a>their bishopricks, &amp; only for putting an end to the <a id="l340"></a>schism confined Meletius to his city &amp; deprived him <a id="l341"></a>of the power of ordeining as you may see in the <a id="l342"></a>epistle of this Council to the Churches of Egypt.<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> <a id="l343"></a>ffor if Meletius &amp; his party continued in communi<a id="l344"></a>on without ever being absolved from excommu<a id="l345"></a>nication (as its plain by the epistle of the Council <a id="l346"></a>of Nice that they did) then they were never <a id="l347"></a>excommunicate: &amp; if so, then the Story of Atha<a id="l348"></a>nasius about their being excommunicate for vari<a id="l349"></a>ous  crimes is a fiction.</p>

<h2 id="hd4" class="cent">Quest. III. <a id="l350"></a><br>Whether the Council of Tyre <a id="l351"></a>&amp; Ierusalem was not an <a id="l352"></a>orthodox authentick Council <a id="l353"></a>bigger then that of Nice.</h2>
<p id="par15">The friends of Athanasius endeavour all they <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> can to diminish the credit of this Council, &amp; make it a <a id="l354"></a>conventicle of a few Bishops selected by his enemies for <a id="l355"></a>oppressing him. So Socrates tells us it consisted of <a id="l356"></a>but sixty Bishops. And yet by considering earlier <a id="l357"></a>records I suspect it was as big or bigger then the <a id="l358"></a>Council of Nice. For the designe of this Council <a id="l359"></a>being very great it needed great credit &amp; authority <a id="l360"></a>to support it. They were not only to examin the <a id="l361"></a>cause of Athanasius but also to receive into com<a id="l362"></a>munion Arius &amp; Euzoius with their followers in <a id="l363"></a>Egypt, as men who had been opprest by a fals <a id="l364"></a>representation of their faith: &amp; it was <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> an ancient <a id="l365"></a>Canon of the Church as well as a necessary one <a id="l366"></a>that no man should be received by a less number <a id="l367"></a>of Bishops then those by which he had been ejected. <a id="l368"></a>And therefore the Emperor sent his letters into all <a id="l369"></a>the Eastern Empire requiring the attendance of the <a id="l370"></a>Bishops that the Council might be full. For this the <a id="l371"></a>eighty eastern bishops in the letter which at their <a id="l372"></a>return from the Council of Sardica they wrote at <a id="l373"></a>Philippopolis, affirm in these words. <em class="underline">Concilium ….. post <a id="l374"></a>alterum annum in Tyro propter Athanasij facinora <a id="l375"></a>necessario iterum celebratur. Advenerunt Episcopi de <a id="l376"></a>Macedonia &amp; de Pannonia Bithynia &amp; omnibus partibus <a id="l377"></a>Orientis, Imperatoris jussione constricti</em>. The eastern <a id="l378"></a>Bishops objected against Athanasius that by returning <a id="l379"></a>to his bishoprick without being restored by as many <a id="l380"></a>bishops as had deposed him he had violated the an<a id="l381"></a>cient Canon: but the friends of Athanasius never <a id="l382"></a>retorted the accusation upon the eastern Bishops <a id="l383"></a>as if they had broken the same Canon in receiving <a id="l384"></a>the Arians at Tyre. In the times next after <a id="l385"></a>the Council the Athanasians never excepted against <a id="l386"></a>it for not being big enough. They never desired <a id="l387"></a>that a fuller Council should be called in the east <a id="l388"></a>to examin the Acts of this: but as if a fuller <a id="l389"></a>could not well be called there, or if called would <a id="l390"></a>not be for their advantage, they appealed to the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006v"> &lt;6v&gt; </span> West. And thereupon arose a quarrel, not between the <a id="l391"></a>West &amp; a few bishops of the east but between the east<a id="l392"></a>ern &amp; western churches, as is plain by the schism <a id="l393"></a>which was thereby made soon after between them. But let us <a id="l394"></a>heare how Eusebius who was in both Councils &amp; <a id="l395"></a>so is a good witness, describes this &amp; compares it <a id="l396"></a>with the other.<sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> For he tells us how the remoter <a id="l397"></a>regions of Macedonia, Pannonia, Mœsia &amp; Persia <a id="l398"></a>sent their Metropolitans thither, &amp; then adds Bithy<a id="l399"></a>ni quoque et Thraces præsentia sua conventum or<a id="l400"></a>nabant, nec deerant e Ciliciæ Episcopis clarissimi <a id="l401"></a>quique.

Quos ex omnibus <a id="l407"></a>Provincijs innumerabilis hominum multitudo seque<a id="l408"></a>batur. And a little after. Hanc secundam syn<a id="l409"></a>odum omnium quas novimus maximam, Imperator <a id="l410"></a>Hierosolymis congregavit, post primam illam quam <a id="l411"></a>in urbe Bithyniæ nobilissima collegerat.

Thus far Eusebius, giving the <a id="l419"></a>preeminence to the latter Synod as being called <a id="l420"></a>upon the more holy &amp; solemn occasion to cele<a id="l421"></a>brate the Emperors greatest year.</p>
<p id="par16">This Council has been reputed Arian &amp; on <a id="l422"></a>that account of no authority, but the accusati<a id="l423"></a>on was never proved &amp; an accusation without <a id="l424"></a>proof is of no credit. The accusation indeed has <a id="l425"></a>gained credit among the followers of Athanasius <a id="l426"></a>for a long time: but this makes it no more <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> then popular fame, &amp; popular fame without <a id="l427"></a>original evidence thô of two thousand years <a id="l428"></a>standing is but popular fame, nor can any man <a id="l429"></a>readily take up with it without making himself <a id="l430"></a>one of the giddy mobile. Such fame indeed when <a id="l431"></a>the original of it is forgotten may make a strong <a id="l432"></a>presumption, but when  we know the original &amp; see <a id="l433"></a>that it was spread abroad without evidence can be <a id="l434"></a>of no moment. Wise men must look only to the <a id="l435"></a>evidence. Now all the evidence that this Council <a id="l436"></a>was Arian is only this, that they received Arius <a id="l437"></a>into communion &amp; banished Athanasius. This is all <a id="l438"></a>the ground upon which the fame of their being Arian <a id="l439"></a>was spread abroad by the mobile of Athanasius his <a id="l440"></a>party &amp; this is no just ground at all. ffor they <a id="l441"></a>did not receive Arius without his disowning those <a id="l442"></a>things for which he had been condemned at Nice, nor <a id="l443"></a>condemned Athanasius for his owning the Nicene <a id="l444"></a>decrees: &amp;  tis not the receiving or condemning <a id="l445"></a>men but the receiving or condemning  opi<a id="l446"></a>nions that can make any Council heretical. So <a id="l447"></a>far was this Council from being Arian that the <a id="l448"></a>Bishops thereof in almost all their following <a id="l449"></a>Councils declared against Arianism &amp; anathema<a id="l450"></a>tized the opinions for which Arius had been condem<a id="l451"></a>ned. If you say they dissembled &amp; were Arians <a id="l452"></a>in their heart while they were orthodox in <a id="l453"></a>their language, I must ask you how you or <a id="l454"></a>any man else can know that. For an accusation <a id="l455"></a>without knowledge of the thing is that which the <a id="l456"></a>world calls clamour calumny &amp; malice. Had <a id="l457"></a>Athanasius &amp; his Moncks the guift of searching <a id="l458"></a>&amp; knowing men's hearts? &amp; is this a ground for <a id="l459"></a>us to rely upon? We have no other means <a id="l460"></a>of knowing men's faith but by their profession <a id="l461"></a>&amp; outward communion &amp; way of worship, &amp; by <a id="l462"></a>all these characters the fathers of this Council <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007v"> &lt;7v&gt; </span> were orthodox. They constantly profest against <a id="l463"></a>Arianism &amp; were in communion with the Chur<a id="l464"></a>ches of al the world &amp; worshipt as other Chur<a id="l465"></a>ches of that age did. For they were never <a id="l466"></a>reprehended by  their enemies upon any of <a id="l467"></a>these heads. Should any Church of our age <a id="l468"></a>charge heresy upon any body of men of her <a id="l469"></a>own communion, &amp; should the men reply that <a id="l470"></a>they always were of the communion of that Church <a id="l471"></a>&amp; always profest her faith &amp; used her worship <a id="l472"></a>&amp;  &amp; that they still continue in that profession &amp; practise; <a id="l473"></a>&amp; should the accusers grant all this &amp; only reply <a id="l474"></a>that notwithstanding their communion profession &amp; <a id="l475"></a>practise they were hereticks in their hearts; &amp; <a id="l476"></a>should the Iudges upon this accusation condemn them <a id="l477"></a>to death: I think such proceedings would by all <a id="l478"></a>sober men be accounted as malicious &amp; barba<a id="l479"></a>rous as any we ever heard of. And yet this <a id="l480"></a>seems to be the case of the Council of Tyre, <a id="l481"></a>who without any proof are accused of heresy by <a id="l482"></a>those of their own communion contrary to their <a id="l483"></a>constant profession &amp; practise, &amp; their authority <a id="l484"></a>murdered upon the accusation.</p>
<p id="par17">If you say that the ffathers of the Council of <a id="l485"></a>Tyre did afterwards in the Councils of Arimi<a id="l486"></a>num &amp; Seleucia declare for Arianism, I answer <a id="l487"></a>that you may  with better reason say that <a id="l488"></a>they declared against Arianism in the Council <a id="l489"></a>of Nice, or if you please that the Nicene Council <a id="l490"></a>was Arian because the Tyrian was so. For the <a id="l491"></a>Councils of Nice &amp; Tyre being great &amp; general <a id="l492"></a>Councils of one &amp; the same Greek Church collect<a id="l493"></a>ed within the space of ten years under one &amp; <a id="l494"></a>the same Emperor have a far greater affinity <a id="l495"></a>with one another then the Councils of Tyre &amp; <a id="l496"></a>Seleucia collected under different Emperors at the <a id="l497"></a>distance of 23 years. If some of the Tyrian <a id="l498"></a>ffathers were at Seleucia many more of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> Nicene were at Tyre. This Council being collected <a id="l499"></a>so soon after that of Nice consisted partly of the <a id="l500"></a>Nicene ffathers &amp; partly of their immediate dis<a id="l501"></a>ciples &amp; successors: nor had Constantine the great <a id="l502"></a>done any thing to make the ffathers of the Greek <a id="l503"></a>churches alter their opinion between these two <a id="l504"></a>Councils: And therefore to accuse the Tyrian <a id="l505"></a>Council of Arianism is in effect to say that the <a id="l506"></a>generality of the Nicene fathers were Arians in <a id="l507"></a>their hearts &amp; dissembled in their subscriptions. For <a id="l508"></a>they refused to subscribe against Arius till Constan<a id="l509"></a>tine came in person into the Council to overawe <a id="l510"></a>them &amp; then they subscribed with reserves. But <a id="l511"></a>between the times of the Councils of Tyre &amp; Se<a id="l512"></a>leucia there was time enough for Constantius to <a id="l513"></a>work a change in the bishops &amp; Constantius was <a id="l514"></a>the more likely man to work it: so that if <a id="l515"></a>there was any change wrought in the greek <a id="l516"></a>Bishops between the Councils of Nice &amp; Seleucia <a id="l517"></a>its much more reasonable to beleive that Con<a id="l518"></a>stantius wrought it after the Council of Tyre <a id="l519"></a>then Constantine before.</p>
<p id="par18">But what if some of the Tyrian Bishops, <a id="l520"></a>what if many of them were Arians? Does <a id="l521"></a>this invalidate the authority of the Council of <a id="l522"></a>Tyre? Surely not. The Athanasians sometimes <a id="l523"></a>complain as if the Eusebians dissembled in the Coun<a id="l524"></a>cil of Nice, but yet would never allow that the <a id="l525"></a>authority of that Council was invalidated thereby. <a id="l526"></a>The authority of a Iudge depends not upon his <a id="l527"></a>religion or sincerity but upon his incorporation <a id="l528"></a>into the body politick, &amp; upon his Commission to <a id="l529"></a>act. And so the authority of a Council depends not <a id="l530"></a>upon the secret religion &amp; sincerity of the men <a id="l531"></a>but upon their being in external communion with <a id="l532"></a>the Church catholick, &amp; having a legal commis<a id="l533"></a>sion to meet &amp; act in Council. For otherwise <a id="l534"></a>we could never be certain that any Council is <a id="l535"></a>authentick. And upon this ground the Council of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008v"> &lt;8v&gt; </span> Tyre was as authentick as any Greek Council ever was <a id="l536"></a>or could be since the Apostles days, they being in <a id="l537"></a>communion with the Church Catholick &amp; legally convened <a id="l538"></a>by the letters of Constantine the great.</p>
<p id="par19">Now that this was an authentick Council is ma<a id="l539"></a>nifest also by the consent of all parties in that age. <a id="l540"></a>For Athanasius &amp; his party in that age questioned <a id="l541"></a>not the authority of this Council, but only complained <a id="l542"></a>as if they had abused their authority by corrupt <a id="l543"></a>judgment. They endeavoured by fixing the imputation <a id="l544"></a>of Arian upon them not to invalidate their authori<a id="l545"></a>ty but to bring their sincerity into question. And <a id="l546"></a>therefore Iulius Bishop of Rome cited the eastern <a id="l547"></a>Bishops to appear before him in a Council to justify <a id="l548"></a>not their authority but their integrity. And when they <a id="l549"></a>would not appear the Council absolved Athanasius  from excommunication, <a id="l551"></a>&amp; received him into communion, acknowledging thereby <a id="l552"></a>that Athanasius by the sentence of the Council of Tyre <a id="l553"></a>did really &amp; truly &amp; regularly stand excommunicate <a id="l554"></a>from the western churches as well as from the east<a id="l555"></a>ern, &amp; by consequence from the Church catholick <a id="l556"></a>untill that asbolution. And agreable to this it is that <a id="l557"></a>Athanasius to prove that Arius died out of the pale of <a id="l558"></a>the church represents that he died the night before <a id="l559"></a>he was to have been received into communion by <a id="l560"></a>the Eusebians. ffor by this story he acknowledges that <a id="l561"></a>those who were received into communion by the Euse<a id="l562"></a>bians were in communion with the Church catholick. <a id="l563"></a>So then by the consent of Athanasius, Pope Iulius <a id="l564"></a>&amp; all their party, the Eusebian Councils before the <a id="l565"></a>rupture between the eastern &amp; western churches <a id="l566"></a>were authentick &amp; their Acts valid &amp; binding.</p>
<p id="par20">It remains therefore that we enquire whether <a id="l567"></a>the Council of Tyre dealt sincerely or corruptly <a id="l568"></a>in the cause of Athanasius.<br><br></p>

<h2 id="hd5" class="cent">Quest IV. <a id="l569"></a><br>Whether it was a dead man's hand in a <a id="l570"></a>bag or the dead body of Arsenius which was laid <a id="l571"></a>before the Council of Tyre to prove that <a id="l572"></a>Arsenius was dead.</h2>
<h2 id="hd6" class="cent">Quest V <a id="l573"></a><br>Whether it was Arsenius alive or only <a id="l574"></a>his letter which Athanasius produced in the <a id="l575"></a>Council of Tyre to prove that he was not dead.</h2>
<h2 id="hd7" class="cent">Quest. VI <a id="l576"></a><br>Whether the story of producing the dead man's hand <a id="l577"></a>and the living Arsenius in the Council of Tyre was not feign<a id="l578"></a>ed by Athanasius about five &amp; twenty <a id="l579"></a>years after the time of the Council <a id="l580"></a>of Tyre.</h2>
<p id="par21">These three questions being of a kind I consider <a id="l581"></a>together as one. For Historians tell us that when Atha<a id="l582"></a>nasius was accused of the death of Arsenius he <a id="l583"></a>represented that Arsenius was alive &amp; thereupon the <a id="l584"></a>Accusers to prove that he was dead produced in the <a id="l585"></a>Council of Tyre a dead man's hand in a bag re<a id="l586"></a>presenting that it was the hand of Arsenius cut off <a id="l587"></a>by Athanasius for magical uses &amp; Athanasius con<a id="l588"></a>futed them by setting the living Arsenius before <a id="l589"></a>the Council &amp; pulling out the man's two hands from under <a id="l590"></a>his cloak to let the Council see that neither of his <a id="l591"></a>hands were cut off: at which the accusers of Athana<a id="l592"></a>sius were ashamed &amp; the Council proceeded no fur<a id="l593"></a>ther. in that accusation there being some among them <a id="l594"></a>who knew Arsenius. And the truth of this story <a id="l595"></a>I question because I find it was unknown in the <a id="l596"></a>times next after the Council  even to Athanasius himself as well as to <a id="l598"></a>others till he published it. For Athanasius about <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009v"> &lt;9v&gt; </span> five years after the Council of Tyre that is about <a id="l599"></a>the year 440, when he was ready to be expelled <a id="l600"></a>his bishoprick the second time called a Council at <a id="l601"></a>Alexandria of 90 Egyptian bishops &amp; in their <a id="l602"></a>name wrote a large elaborate letter to all <a id="l603"></a>the world in his own defense against the accusa<a id="l604"></a>tions &amp; proceedings in the Council of Tyre &amp; seems <a id="l605"></a>to omit nothing that could be thought of in his <a id="l606"></a>behalf &amp; yet says not one word of the dead mans <a id="l607"></a>hand, nor of Arsenius appearing alive at Tyre. <a id="l608"></a>Neither is there any mention of these things in the <a id="l609"></a>letter which Pope Iulius about two years after <a id="l610"></a>wrote to the eastern bishops from a Council at <a id="l611"></a>Rome in behalf of Athanasius who was then <a id="l612"></a>amongst them. Neither are they mentioned in the <a id="l613"></a>two large letters which Athanasius &amp; the Bishops <a id="l614"></a>of his party, assembled about five years after <a id="l615"></a>out of Egypt &amp; all the west  in the Council of Sar<a id="l616"></a>dica, wrote to the same purpose, the one to the <a id="l617"></a>Church of Alexandria the other to all the Churches <a id="l618"></a>In all these letters they talk of Arsenius &amp; <a id="l619"></a>say that he was alive but do not say that he <a id="l620"></a>appeared alive at Tyre tho that one thing had <a id="l621"></a>it been true would have been more to the pur<a id="l622"></a>pose then all the rest which they say. They do not say that <a id="l623"></a>they or any of them had seen him alive, or that <a id="l624"></a>they had any witnesses of his being alive, as they <a id="l625"></a>might &amp; surely would have done had he been <a id="l626"></a>seen alive before all the world at Tyre.</p>
<p id="par22">But that which makes me most doubt of <a id="l627"></a>the story is that I find it otherwise related <a id="l628"></a>by Athanasius &amp; his friends in these very letters <a id="l629"></a>of the Councils of Alexandria &amp; Sardica. ffor in <a id="l630"></a>these Letters, (which being recorded by Athanasius <a id="l631"></a>himself in his second Apology as well as writ <a id="l632"></a>by him &amp; his friends are of unquestionable <a id="l633"></a>authority,) they tell the story as if the accu<a id="l634"></a>sers produced before the Council not a dead <a id="l635"></a>man's hand but a dead body: &amp; Athanasius pro<a id="l636"></a>duced against them not Arsenius alive but his <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> Letter only &amp; the accusers were so far from <a id="l637"></a>being ashamed that the Council nothwithstanding <a id="l638"></a>the Letter proceeded to condemn Athanasius for <a id="l639"></a>the murder.</p>
<p id="par23">And first that it was a dead body, the Coun<a id="l640"></a>cil of  Sardica in their letter to <a id="l641"></a>the Church of Alexandria tells  expresly <a id="l642"></a>in these words. <em class="underline">They</em> [that is the Council of <a id="l643"></a>Tyre] <em class="underline">said &amp; lamented that Athanasius had com<a id="l644"></a>mitted murder &amp; killed one Arsenius a Mele<a id="l645"></a>tian Bishop: which thing they bewailed with <a id="l646"></a>feigned groans &amp; fals tears</em>, καὶ ἠξίουν του <a id="l647"></a>ζωντυς ὠς τεθνηκότος τὸ σωμα ἀποδοθηναι <a id="l648"></a><em class="underline">&amp; commanded or desired the <span class="larger"><strong>BODY</strong></span> of him that lived <a id="l649"></a>as if he  had been dead to be brought <a id="l650"></a>before them. But their fallacies did not lie <a id="l651"></a>hid. ffor all men knew that the man did live <a id="l652"></a>&amp; was proved to be alive</em> [viz<sup>t</sup> by his letter.] <em class="underline"><a id="l653"></a>And yet when these versatile men saw their <a id="l654"></a>figments thus confuted (for Arsenius being <a id="l655"></a>alive has</em> [by his Letter] <em class="underline">shewn that he was <a id="l656"></a>not killed nor dead) they would not thus <a id="l657"></a>acquiesce but</em> [afterwards in the reign of <a id="l658"></a>Constantius] <em class="underline">added new fals accusations to the <a id="l659"></a>old ones, that they might again involve the <a id="l660"></a>man in calumnies</em>. So then it was not a <a id="l661"></a>magical salted hand but the the whole preserved <a id="l662"></a>body of a dead man which the accusers of Atha<a id="l663"></a>nasius laid or desired to be laid before the Council. In cases of mur<a id="l664"></a>der tis usual to have dead bodies viewed for <a id="l665"></a>passing judgment upon them; &amp; this was done in <a id="l666"></a>the Council that by the features &amp; other marks <a id="l667"></a>&amp; wounds &amp; testimony of those who knew Ar<a id="l668"></a>senius or had seen his body at the time of the mur<a id="l669"></a>der &amp; buried it &amp; dug it up again the Council <a id="l670"></a>might be satisfied whether he was murdered &amp; <a id="l671"></a>how. But it seems, to sham the proceedings of the <a id="l672"></a>Council some Iugler (I will not say Sorcerer) <a id="l673"></a>has transformed the whole body into a magical <a id="l674"></a>hand.</p>
<p id="par24">And on the contrary by the same art the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010v"> &lt;10v&gt; </span> Letter of Arsenius has been transformed into Arse<a id="l675"></a>nius himself. ffor that Athanasius &amp; his friends had <a id="l676"></a>no other evidence of Arsenius's being alive besides <a id="l677"></a>that Letter, he &amp; his Bishops in the Council of <a id="l678"></a>Alexandria have plainly acknowledged in these <a id="l679"></a>words. Athanasius say they was accused of killing <a id="l680"></a>one Arsenius &amp; breaking the communion cup. But <a id="l681"></a>Arsenius is alive &amp; [in his Letter] desires your com<a id="l682"></a>munion, &amp; expects not other testimonies that <a id="l683"></a>he should appear alive, but he himself confesses <a id="l684"></a>that he lives, writing in his own letters to our fellow <a id="l685"></a>Bishop Athanasius whom they assert his murderer. <a id="l686"></a>Nor were the impious ashamed to affirm him the <a id="l687"></a>murderer of one who was in a remote place divided <a id="l688"></a>from us by journeys both by sea &amp; land living in <a id="l689"></a>a region at that time unknown to all men. Yea they <a id="l690"></a>studied to hide him &amp; make him disappear when he <a id="l691"></a>suffered nothing. And as far as they were able they <a id="l692"></a>translated him into another world, being ready to kill <a id="l693"></a>him that either by his real or feigned murder they <a id="l694"></a>might kill Athanasius. But thanks be to the divine <a id="l695"></a>providence who suffers nothing unjust to prosper but <a id="l696"></a>hath before the eyes of all men produced Arsenius <a id="l697"></a>living &amp; openly detecting their calumny &amp; deceipt. <a id="l698"></a>ffor he does not shun us as his murderers nor <a id="l699"></a>hate us as injurious to him (for he suffers no evil <a id="l700"></a>from us:) but desires to communicate with us <a id="l701"></a>&amp; to be of our number as his Letter shews. And yet <a id="l702"></a>notwithstanding this they proceeded against Athana<a id="l703"></a>sius &amp; banished him as a murderer. ffor it <a id="l704"></a>was not the Emperor Constantine but their ca<a id="l705"></a>lumnies which banished him. Here you see Atha<a id="l706"></a>nasius &amp; his Bishops are so far from pretending that <a id="l707"></a>he appeared alive at Tyre that on the contrary <a id="l708"></a>they insist only upon the evidence of his Letter <a id="l709"></a>&amp; represent that no other evidence was to be ex<a id="l710"></a>pected &amp; by consequence had no other, &amp; magnify <a id="l711"></a>this evidence so much as if God had thereby pro<a id="l712"></a>duced Arsenius alive before the eyes of all men: <a id="l713"></a>&amp; complain that notwithstanding this Letter the Coun<a id="l714"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span>cil of Tyre proceeded against Athanasius &amp; banished <a id="l715"></a>him as a murderer: This they wrote five years <a id="l716"></a>after the Council of Tyre when things were <a id="l717"></a>fresh in their memory &amp; contrary stories were <a id="l718"></a>not yet invented.</p>
<p id="par25">So then this Letter is the whole ground of <a id="l719"></a>all the confidence wherewith Athanasius &amp; his <a id="l720"></a>friends so constantly reported that Arsenius was <a id="l721"></a>alive. And tho they tell us sometimes that they <a id="l722"></a>knew he was alive, or that he had shewed that <a id="l723"></a>he was not dead, or that God had produced him <a id="l724"></a>living &amp; openly detecting the calumny before <a id="l725"></a>the eyes of all men, yet they mean only <a id="l726"></a>by his Letter. This evidence they magnify <a id="l727"></a>thus extravagantly because they had no other <a id="l728"></a>For had they known where he was or where <a id="l729"></a>any witnesses were which had seen him (as they <a id="l730"></a>would have known of multitudes had he been <a id="l731"></a>seen by all the world at Tyre) they would <a id="l732"></a>have sent for him or the witnesses &amp; had them <a id="l733"></a>in readiness at their Councils to satisfy all their <a id="l734"></a>party, &amp; made a greater noise about such <a id="l735"></a>evidence then about a letter which no upright <a id="l736"></a>Court of Iudicature would allow for any evi<a id="l737"></a>dence at all. And yet I cannot find that in <a id="l738"></a>all their endeavours to overthrow the Council <a id="l739"></a>of Tyre they ever pretended to have so <a id="l740"></a>much as one living witness who had seen <a id="l741"></a>Arsenius alive. So far are the Egyptian Bish<a id="l742"></a>ops from saying that any of them or any body <a id="l743"></a>else had seen Arsenius at Tyre, that they insist <a id="l744"></a>only on the evidence of his letter &amp; say that he <a id="l745"></a>expects no other testimonies of his being alive, <a id="l746"></a>that is, that he contents himself with having <a id="l747"></a>given them that testimony &amp; therefore they <a id="l748"></a>are not to look for any other. So far are <a id="l749"></a>they from saying that he in person put the <a id="l750"></a>accusers to shame, or stopt the proceedings of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011v"> &lt;11v&gt; </span> Council upon this accusation that on the contrary they <a id="l751"></a>say that the Council proceeded against Athanasius <a id="l752"></a>notwithstanding the evidence of the letter &amp; banisht <a id="l753"></a>him as a murderer, which deserves well to be no<a id="l754"></a>ted. For in this one pasage you have the concurrent <a id="l755"></a>testimony of both parties against his being seen alive <a id="l756"></a>in the Council: that of Athanasius &amp; his Egyptian <a id="l757"></a>Bishops in objecting nothing more then the letter of <a id="l758"></a>Arsenius against the proceedings of the Council &amp; that <a id="l759"></a>of the eastern Bishops in proceeding on to condemn <a id="l760"></a>Athanasius for the murder. For in doing this they <a id="l761"></a> adjudged &amp; declared that Arsenius was murdered <a id="l762"></a>&amp; by consequence not seen alive in the Council. Nor <a id="l763"></a>did they only adjudge &amp; declare this in the Council <a id="l764"></a>but afterwards constantly persisted in it, as you <a id="l765"></a>may see in their Letter from the Council of Anti<a id="l766"></a>och to Pope Iulius, &amp; in that which in their return <a id="l767"></a>from the Council of Sardica they wrote at Philippo<a id="l768"></a>polis to all the world: And for my part I can more <a id="l769"></a>easily beleive what both parties affirmed in that <a id="l770"></a>age before newer stories were invented; then that <a id="l771"></a>the Bishops of all the east should condemn Athana<a id="l772"></a>sius for murdering a man who appeared alive <a id="l773"></a>before them in the midst of the Council &amp; owned <a id="l774"></a>himself to be Arsenius &amp; was known by many there; <a id="l775"></a>&amp; be able to satisfy the Emperor Constantine &amp; <a id="l776"></a>the eastern nations of the justness of such a sen<a id="l777"></a>tence. For upon Athanasius's appealing from the <a id="l778"></a>Council the Emperor heard the cause over again <a id="l779"></a>between Athanasius &amp; the Legates of the Council <a id="l780"></a>&amp; he &amp; the East were satisfied in their proceedings.</p>
<p id="par26">So then the story of the dead man's hand <a id="l781"></a>&amp; the living Arsenius at Tyre seems to be a fable unknown <a id="l782"></a>in those times &amp; therefore invented afterwards. And <a id="l783"></a>I suspect Athanasius to be the inventor of it because <a id="l784"></a>he tells it first of any man in his second Apology <a id="l785"></a>written in the wilderness at the same time that <a id="l786"></a>he broached the story of the death of Arius. ffor <a id="l787"></a>if he knew it to be fals (as he did if it were <a id="l788"></a>so) then he was not imposed upon  others, but told <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span> it to impose upon others &amp; so is the Author.</p>

<h2 id="hd8" class="cent">Quest. VII. <a id="l789"></a><br>Whether the Letter of Pinnes for <a id="l790"></a>proving Arsenius to be alive was <a id="l791"></a>not feigned by Athanasius at the <a id="l792"></a>same time with the story of the <a id="l793"></a>dead man's hand.</h2>
<p id="par27">In all the times of the controversy about the <a id="l794"></a>Council of Tyre I cannot find that Athana<a id="l795"></a>sius or his friends pretended that Arsenius <a id="l796"></a>had been seen alive by any living witnesses <a id="l797"></a>The Councils of Alexandria Rome &amp; Sardica <a id="l798"></a>knew nothing of any such witnesses. But <a id="l799"></a>afterwards when Athanasius was condemned <a id="l800"></a>by all the world &amp; so saw that the letter of <a id="l801"></a>Arsenius would not any longer support the <a id="l802"></a>beleife that Arsenius was alive, he put about <a id="l803"></a>a story amongst his credulous followers as <a id="l804"></a>if Arsenius himself in person had been found <a id="l805"></a>alive first in Egypt with one Pinnes &amp; then at Tyre, &amp; tells <a id="l806"></a>the story of his first finding thus</p>
<p id="par28">Now that Arsenius was hidden [by the <a id="l807"></a>Meletians] that they might make his murder <a id="l808"></a>more probable, his friends who were with him <a id="l809"></a>testified. ffor in seeking him we found one of <a id="l810"></a>them who wrote to Iohn (another actor in <a id="l811"></a>the same fals accusation) the following Letter.</p>

<p id="par29">I would have you know that Athanasius sent <a id="l815"></a>his Deacon into Thebais to search all places for <a id="l816"></a>Arsenius.

But when we had learnt <a id="l819"></a>that, we caused him to be put into a ship &amp; <a id="l820"></a>carried down with Helias the Monck into the lower <a id="l821"></a>parts [of Egypt.] And soon after the Deacon <a id="l822"></a>with some others coming upon us went into our <a id="l823"></a>house &amp; found him not by reason that we had <a id="l824"></a>sent him as was said into the lower parts: But <a id="l825"></a>me &amp; Helias the Monck who had conveyed him away <a id="l826"></a>they carried away with them to Alexandria &amp; <a id="l827"></a>brought us before the governour &amp; I could not <a id="l828"></a>deny but confessed that he lived &amp; was not killed <a id="l829"></a>The same thing also was confessed by the Monck <a id="l830"></a>who had carried him away. Wherefore, o Father I <a id="l831"></a>make known to you these things that you may <a id="l832"></a>not accuse Athanasius. For they said that he was <a id="l833"></a>alive &amp; hidden with us &amp; it was made known to <a id="l834"></a>all Egypt &amp; cannot any longer be concealed. I <a id="l835"></a>Paphnutius a Monck of the same house who have <a id="l836"></a>written this Epistle salute you much. Farewell.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p id="par30">Now the truth of this Epistle I suspect for <a id="l837"></a>these reasons. ffirst because Athanasius &amp; his <a id="l838"></a>ffriends knew nothing of this evidence in the <a id="l839"></a>Councils of Alexandria Rome &amp;  Sardica. <a id="l840"></a>So many living witnesses that Arsenius was alive <a id="l841"></a>&amp; the proof thereof by some of those witnesses <a id="l842"></a>before the governour of Egypt, would have <a id="l843"></a>made a much greater noise in the Council of <a id="l844"></a>Tyre &amp; afterwards then the single Letter of <a id="l845"></a>Arsenius: &amp; yet Athanasius &amp; his friends at that <a id="l846"></a>time insisted only upon the evidence of this Letter <a id="l847"></a>representing that Arsenius himself had shewed <a id="l848"></a>by his letter that he was alive &amp; intended no <a id="l849"></a>other evidence of his being alive &amp; complaining <a id="l850"></a>that the Council of Tyre had banished Athanasi<a id="l851"></a>us notwithstanding that letter. This was all that <a id="l852"></a>Athanasius &amp; his friends had then to allege as we <a id="l853"></a>have shewed out of the letter of the Council <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013r"> &lt;13r&gt; </span> of Alexandria</p>
<p id="par31">And secondly I suspect the letter of Pinnes <a id="l854"></a>because it represents things contrary to what <a id="l855"></a>Athanasius &amp; his friends did in the Letter <a id="l856"></a>of the Council of Alexandria. For here we are <a id="l857"></a>told that Arsenius at first lay hid in upper <a id="l858"></a>Egypt till the Deacon of Athanasius upon search <a id="l859"></a>discovered him &amp; that he then retired into the <a id="l860"></a>lower Egypt &amp; soon after, as Athanasius adds, <a id="l861"></a>wrote his famous Letter. But in the Letter <a id="l862"></a>of the Council of Alexandria we are told that <a id="l863"></a>the accusers of Athanasius were not ashamed <a id="l864"></a>to affirm him the murderer of one who was <a id="l865"></a>in a remote place divided from the Egyptians <a id="l866"></a>by journeys both by sea &amp; land, living in a <a id="l867"></a>region at that time unknown to all men, &amp; <a id="l868"></a>being hidden by them &amp; translated as far as <a id="l869"></a>could be into another world untill he made <a id="l870"></a>himself known by his letter. /</p>
<p id="par32">And lastly the stories of finding Arsenius <a id="l871"></a>first in Egypt &amp; then at Tyre are of a kind <a id="l872"></a>&amp; were told by the same man at the same <a id="l873"></a>time &amp; therefore must stand or fall together.</p>

<h2 id="hd10" class="cent">Quest VIII. <a id="l874"></a><br>Whether the Letter of Arsenius <a id="l875"></a>was not feigned by Athanasius before <a id="l876"></a>the convening of the Council of Tyre</h2>
<p id="par33">This famous letter pretended to be written <a id="l877"></a>by Arsenius after he had for some time lain <a id="l878"></a>hidden runs thus.</p>
<p id="par34">To Athanasius the blessed Pope, Arsenius <a id="l879"></a>Bishop of the City  Hypselita which was formerly <a id="l880"></a>under Meletius, &amp; to the Presbyters &amp; Deacons <a id="l881"></a>much health in the Lord.</p>
<p id="par35">And we loving peace &amp; union with the catho<a id="l882"></a>lick Church which you by the grace of God are set <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013v"> &lt;13v&gt; </span> over, &amp; desiring to be subject to the ecclesiasti<a id="l883"></a>cal canon according to the ancient law: do write <a id="l884"></a>to you beloved Pope promising in the name of the <a id="l885"></a>Lord that we will not hence forward communi<a id="l886"></a>cate with Schismaticks &amp; such as are not in peace <a id="l887"></a>with the catholick church whether they be Bishops <a id="l888"></a>or Presbyters or Deacons; neither will we assemble <a id="l889"></a>our selves with them in any Synod, nor send them <a id="l890"></a>letters of peace nor receive such letters from <a id="l891"></a>them nor without the advice &amp; assent of you the <a id="l892"></a>Metropolitan Bishop make any decree about Bishops <a id="l893"></a>or about any other common ecclesiastical opinion; <a id="l894"></a>but we will give place to the received  canons after the manner of Ammonianus, <a id="l896"></a>Tyrannus, Plusianus &amp; the other Bishops. Moreover <a id="l897"></a>we beseech your humanity therefore to write back <a id="l898"></a>to us as soon as may be &amp; also to our fellow Bis<a id="l899"></a>hops concerning us. &amp; shew them that  we now <a id="l900"></a>stand to the ancient decrees being at peace with <a id="l901"></a>the Catholick Church, &amp; united to our fellow <a id="l902"></a>Bishops of those regions. And we beleive that by <a id="l903"></a>your prayers as being powerfull this peace will <a id="l904"></a>remain firm &amp; indissolvable to the end according to <a id="l905"></a>the will of God the Lord of all things, through <a id="l906"></a>Iesus Christ our Lord. The whole Clergy that <a id="l907"></a>is under you we &amp; they that are with us salute, <a id="l908"></a>&amp; so soon as God shall permit we will come to <a id="l909"></a>your humanity. I Arsenius wish you may long <a id="l910"></a>fare well most blessed Pope.</p>
<p id="par36">Now the truth of this Letter I suspect, first <a id="l911"></a>because it has not the form &amp; humour of a free <a id="l912"></a>letter but looks like some formal covenant <a id="l913"></a>of submission drawn up by a Lawyer to be impo<a id="l914"></a>sed on Arsenius, or like a recantation imposed <a id="l915"></a>on him by a magistrate. Then because Arsenius <a id="l916"></a>had he been of the mind here exprest would cer<a id="l917"></a>tainly have made good his promise of coming to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> Athanasius. He would not have suffered the <a id="l918"></a>whole Roman world for many years  <a id="l919"></a>to continue in war &amp; confusion about his death <a id="l920"></a>but have speedily shewn himself to the Emperor <a id="l921"></a>&amp; to the world to the confusion of all the enemies <a id="l922"></a>of his dear friend Athanasius. Thirdly because <a id="l923"></a>were this letter genuine Athanasius must have <a id="l924"></a>known how to write back to Arsenius &amp; conse<a id="l925"></a>quently knowing where he was would have sent <a id="l926"></a>&amp; fetcht him by fair meanes or by foule &amp; <a id="l927"></a>shewed him alive to the Emperor. Lastly be<a id="l928"></a>cause I find this letter directly contradicted <a id="l929"></a>by Athanasius himself. ffor he in his Apology <a id="l930"></a>pag 783 tells the story of the hand after this man<a id="l931"></a>ner.<sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup> <em class="underline">Arsenius</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">was first found hid in <a id="l932"></a>Egypt: afterwards those of our side found him <a id="l933"></a>hidden at Tyre. And, which is strange, when he <a id="l934"></a>was found he would not confess himself to be Ar<a id="l935"></a>senius untill in judgment he was convicted by <a id="l936"></a>Paul Bishop of Tyre. And from that time being <a id="l937"></a>ashamed he denied himself no more. Now he did <a id="l938"></a>that to keep the compact which he had made with <a id="l939"></a>the Eusebians, least he being found &amp; discovered <a id="l940"></a>the plot should be laid open &amp; dissolved</em>. This <a id="l941"></a>passage I say wherein Arsenius is represented <a id="l942"></a>confederate with the Eusebians till the Council <a id="l943"></a>of Tyre does absolutely contradict his letter <a id="l944"></a>wherein he is made to renounce that party &amp; <a id="l945"></a>side with Athanasius before. Nor can it be <a id="l946"></a>pretended that Arsenius turned to &amp; fro, seing <a id="l947"></a>Athanasius with his Bishops in the Council of Alex<a id="l948"></a>andria four or five years after the Council of <a id="l949"></a>Tyre, pleaded from this letter that Arsenius <a id="l950"></a>then desired their communion. So then both <a id="l951"></a>these contradictious records cannot be true, or rather <a id="l952"></a>they must both be false, destroying one another. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014v"> &lt;14v&gt; </span> ffor had Arsenius been discovered in such a manner <a id="l953"></a>at Tyre, then would not Athanasius &amp; his Bishops <a id="l954"></a>a while after in the Council of Alexandria <a id="l955"></a>have collected &amp; pleaded from his letter writ <a id="l956"></a>before, that he did at that time desire their com<a id="l957"></a>munion. And had the Letter been genuine Atha<a id="l958"></a>nasius would not afterwards have overthrown <a id="l959"></a>the credit of it by telling that contrary story <a id="l960"></a>of Arsenius at Tyre. But it seems his me<a id="l961"></a>mory failed him.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="hd11" class="cent">Quest IX. <a id="l962"></a><br>Whether the Letter of Ischyras <a id="l963"></a>was not feigned by Athanasius.</h2>
<p id="par37">When Athanasius was accused of the above <a id="l964"></a>mentioned crimes by Ischyras, he pretended that <a id="l965"></a>Ischyras became penitent &amp; wrote the follow<a id="l966"></a>ing Letter.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="hd12" class="cent">To the Blessed Pope Athanasius, Ischyras <a id="l967"></a>wisheth health in the Lord.</h2>
<p id="par38">Seing upon my coming to you Lord Bishop <a id="l968"></a>to be received into the Church, you chid me for <a id="l969"></a>what I had heretofore spoken, as if I did that <a id="l970"></a>on my own accord, I have therefore sent you <a id="l971"></a>this Apology in my writing that you might know <a id="l972"></a>that there was force done to me &amp; that I was <a id="l973"></a>beaten by Isaac &amp; Heraclides &amp; Isaac of Leotis <a id="l974"></a>&amp; by their companions. But I calling God to wit<a id="l975"></a>ness upon this do say for my excuse that I am <a id="l976"></a>conscious of none of those things done by you of <a id="l977"></a>which they speak. ffor neither was there any cup <a id="l978"></a>broken nor holy Table overthrown, but all these <a id="l979"></a>calumnies they urged me to by force. These things <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015r"> &lt;15r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">I apologize for my selfe &amp; give you in writing <a id="l980"></a>desiring to be one of your assembly. Farewell in <a id="l981"></a>the Lord. I have given this my hand to you <a id="l982"></a>Bishop Athanasius in the presence of the Presby<a id="l983"></a>ters Ammon of Dicelle, Heraclius of Phasco, <a id="l984"></a>Boccon of Chenebri, Achillas of Myrsene, Didy<a id="l985"></a>mus of Taphosiris &amp; Iustus of Bomotheus: &amp; of <a id="l986"></a>the Deacons of Alexandria, Paul Peter &amp; Olym<a id="l987"></a>pius; &amp; these of Mareote, Ammonius, Pistus, Deme<a id="l988"></a>trius &amp; Gaius</em>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p id="par39">Now this Letter I suspect because it looks <a id="l989"></a>as if contrived rather for the interest of Atha<a id="l990"></a>nasius then that of Ischyras, &amp; seems more like <a id="l991"></a>a formal recantation or certificate then a free <a id="l992"></a>Letter, &amp; also conteins a ridiculous story. For <a id="l993"></a> its ridiculous that men should go about to procure false accu<a id="l994"></a>sers or witnesses by forcing or beating them? <a id="l995"></a>And were a false accuser or witness so procured <a id="l996"></a>tis not likely that after his discovering the kna<a id="l997"></a>very he would go on in accusing or witnessing <a id="l998"></a>as Ischyras did to the end. Could a beating bout <a id="l999"></a>make Ischyras so hearty in the cause?</p>
<p id="par40">And further if Ischyras went to Athanasius <a id="l1000"></a>to be reconciled to him &amp; received into communion <a id="l1001"></a>as this letter represents, he went with designe <a id="l1002"></a>either to confess his fault or not. If to confess, <a id="l1003"></a>how came Athanasius to let him go without taking <a id="l1004"></a>his confession before witnesses? If not to confess, <a id="l1005"></a>how could he hope to be pardonned &amp; received by <a id="l1006"></a>Athanasius? And afterwards, if he sent this Letter <a id="l1007"></a>of confession, how came Athanasius then to neglect <a id="l1008"></a>sending for him &amp; making his advantage of the op<a id="l1009"></a>portunity? Would Athanasius send up &amp; down the <a id="l1010"></a>world to seek Arsenius &amp; not accept of Ischyras <a id="l1011"></a>when he offered to come in, but content himself <a id="l1012"></a>with a bare letter? These things don't consist.</p>
<p id="par41">But that which looks most odly is the wit<a id="l1013"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015v"> &lt;15v&gt; </span>nessing of this Letter. For witnesses are never set <a id="l1014"></a>to Letters. They are set to no sort of writings but <a id="l1015"></a>such as are designed for evidence in legal proceedings <a id="l1016"></a>&amp; therefore shew that the author of this letter de<a id="l1017"></a>signed it for evidence: that is, he designed by those <a id="l1018"></a>witnesses to make it evidence for Athanasius against <a id="l1019"></a>Ischyras. For there was no need of such evidence <a id="l1020"></a>against any body else. Were these witnesses added <a id="l1021"></a>to give credit to this Letter with Athanasius? <a id="l1022"></a>There was no need of that. Were they added to <a id="l1023"></a>give credit to it with others? Then the designe <a id="l1024"></a>of it was not to make an interest with  <a id="l1025"></a>Athanasius for Ischyras but to make an interest <a id="l1026"></a>with others for Athanasius against Ischyras. Had <a id="l1027"></a>Ischyras been penitent &amp; desired to be reconciled to <a id="l1028"></a>Athanasius as this Letter represents, he would not <a id="l1029"></a>have sent a certificate to Athanasius against him<a id="l1030"></a>self, but have wrote an insinuating letter in gene<a id="l1031"></a>ral termes, &amp; have reserved himself to be usefull <a id="l1032"></a>to Athanasius as an evidence upon condition of par<a id="l1033"></a>don &amp; reconciliation; &amp; no doubt Athanasius would <a id="l1034"></a>have accepted the condition with both hands.</p>
<p id="par42">There is another thing which looks very sus<a id="l1035"></a>piciously. For many persons are named as witnesses <a id="l1036"></a>but in such a manner as makes it plain that their hands were not to the letter. Would any <a id="l1037"></a>man call his friends together to be witnesses to a <a id="l1038"></a>writing &amp; not make them set their hands to it? <a id="l1039"></a>If Ischyras wrote this Letter he either designed it <a id="l1040"></a>for evidence or he did not. If he did not he would <a id="l1041"></a>have made no mention of witnesses. If he did he <a id="l1042"></a>would certainly have caused them to set their hands <a id="l1043"></a>to it. It looks therefore as written by somebody <a id="l1044"></a>else who had a mind to give credit to it by <a id="l1045"></a>witnesses, but knew not how either to procure <a id="l1046"></a>or counterfeit their hands.</p>
<p id="par43">And the suspicion is much encreased by con<a id="l1047"></a>sidering that the truth of this letter was never <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span> proved (that I can find) by the actual testimony of <a id="l1048"></a>any of the witnesses. The Letter was written before <a id="l1049"></a>the Council of Tyre &amp; by consequence alleged in that <a id="l1050"></a>Council, &amp; in the Councils of Alexandria Rome &amp; Sar<a id="l1051"></a>dica where Athanasius was present: but no witnesses <a id="l1052"></a>that I can read of were ever brought to prove it <a id="l1053"></a>Iulius Bishop of Rome in his letter for Athanasius, tells how Athanasius produced the authentick hand writing of Ischyras confessing that he was suborned. He does not say that Athanasius had proved by witnesses that Ischyras wrote that confession but lays the whole stress of the evidence upon the handwriting of Ischyras. I would ask therefore whether Athanasius &amp; his <a id="l1054"></a>friends did try to get this Letter proved in the <a id="l1055"></a>Council of Tyre &amp; on other occasions or not. If <a id="l1056"></a>they did not, it argues a guilty conscience. ffor <a id="l1057"></a>without any examination of the business they took <a id="l1058"></a>it for granted that the witnesses would be against <a id="l1059"></a>them &amp; therefore did not beleive the reality of <a id="l1060"></a>their testimony to the Letter. But if they did try <a id="l1061"></a>&amp; upon examining the witnesses found them against <a id="l1062"></a>this Letter, then is the Letter false by the concur<a id="l1063"></a>rent testimony of those very witnesses cited to prove <a id="l1064"></a>it true. And this is to me a very great argument <a id="l1065"></a>of suspicion. For the case is as if a man should <a id="l1066"></a>produce a bond wherein tis written that the party <a id="l1067"></a>pretended to be bound signed it before such &amp; <a id="l1068"></a>such witnesses but whose hands are not to the bond, <a id="l1069"></a>&amp; before a Iudge should produce none of the wit<a id="l1070"></a>nesses, but confess that he never spake with them <a id="l1071"></a>or that they are all against him being the Defend<a id="l1072"></a>ants friends, &amp; only plead that they are good wit<a id="l1073"></a>nesses because in the bond (pretended to be sent in <a id="l1074"></a>a letter to the Plaintiff) tis written that the De<a id="l1075"></a>fendant signed it in their presence. So impudent a <a id="l1076"></a>case as this was scarce ever brought before a civil Magistrate. </p>

<p id="par44">When Athanasius being banished first by Constantine the <a id="l1086"></a>great &amp; then by his son Constantius appealed from the <a id="l1087"></a>Council of Tyre to the Pope, &amp; the eastern Bishops were <a id="l1088"></a>thereupon summoned first to the Council of Rome &amp; then <a id="l1089"></a>to the Council of Sardica to appear &amp; plead their cause <a id="l1090"></a>but would not subject themselves to the authority of <a id="l1091"></a>the Pope &amp; jurisdiction of the Western Bishops: Constan<a id="l1092"></a>tius Emperor of the West by the impulse  <a id="l1093"></a>of the western Bishops wrote a letter to his brother <a id="l1094"></a>Constantius, threatning that if he would not restore <a id="l1095"></a>Athanasius &amp; animadvert upon his adversaries, he would <a id="l1096"></a>come himself &amp; restore him by force.

<p id="par47">The second of these two epistles is said by Hilary <a id="l1137"></a>to have been written (before the first) upon occasion of a Council con<a id="l1138"></a>vening at Sirmium against Photinus two years <a id="l1139"></a>after the Council of Millain &amp; by consequence <a id="l1140"></a>four years after the Council of Sardica. ffor  Pe<a id="l1141"></a>tavius &amp; Valesius agree with Socrates in placing <a id="l1142"></a>this Council of Sirmium in the year 351, &amp; the Council of Sardica met A.C. 347 &amp; Liberius <a id="l1143"></a>in his Epistle to Constantius written after George <a id="l1144"></a>was made Bishop of Alexandria, &amp; by consequence A.<a id="l1145"></a>C. 356 or A.C. 357, reccons eight years from the <a id="l1146"></a>Council of Millain to the writing of that Epistle, <a id="l1147"></a>&amp; therefore the Council of Millain was celebrated A.<a id="l1148"></a>C. 348 or 349.</p>
<p id="par48">Now this second Epistle I suspect for many <a id="l1149"></a>reasons.</p>
<p id="par49">1. It is a confession attested by nameless witnesses, <a id="l1150"></a>&amp; was never proved.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p017v"> &lt;17v&gt; </span>
<p id="par50">2. The crime is too great &amp; shamefull for Bishops <a id="l1151"></a>to acknowledge voluntarily as Valens &amp; Vrsatius are <a id="l1152"></a>here represented to have done. Nor it is likely that after such a confession they could  have acted  in the western Councils with so great authority reputation &amp; success as they did.</p>
<p id="par51">3. <em class="underline">Eusebius</em> who is mentioned in the Epistle as then living was <a id="l1153"></a>dead some yeares before. And if with Hilary &amp; Sozo<a id="l1154"></a>men to avoid this objection you write <em class="underline">Athanasius</em> for <a id="l1155"></a><em class="underline">Eusebius</em>, the sense will be hard. ffor Athanasius will <a id="l1156"></a>be accused of an evil mind; which is contrary to the <a id="l1157"></a>designe of the Epistle.</p>
<p id="par52">4. The saying that Valens &amp; Vrsatius being re<a id="l1158"></a>quired to prove the things charged against Athana<a id="l1159"></a>sius could not do it is not consistent with the pro<a id="l1160"></a>ceedings in the Council of Sardica. For there five <a id="l1161"></a>of the six Bishops then living who had been sent <a id="l1162"></a>from the Council of Tyre to Mareote to examin the <a id="l1163"></a>business of Ischyras (two of which five were Valens <a id="l1164"></a>&amp; Vrsatius) propounded to the western Bishops that an <a id="l1165"></a>equal number of both parties should be sent again <a id="l1166"></a>to Mareote to examin things anew, &amp; if the  <a id="l1167"></a>crime did not appear, they five would be excom<a id="l1168"></a>municated, but if it did, the like number of the <a id="l1169"></a>western bishops who created the disturbance should <a id="l1170"></a>be excommunicated by the eastern. But the western <a id="l1171"></a>Bishops would not accept of equal terms. The eastern <a id="l1172"></a>must submit to the authority of the Pope &amp; juris<a id="l1173"></a>diction of the western or go for criminals.</p>
<p id="par53">5. Pope Liberius <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup> in his Letters to Constantius <a id="l1174"></a>in behalf of Athanasius, makes no mention of this <a id="l1175"></a>confession of Vrsatius &amp; Valens, as he would surely <a id="l1176"></a>have done had it been newly made to his Prede<a id="l1177"></a>cessor</p>
<p id="par54">6. The great Council of Ariminum <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup> in their <a id="l1178"></a>Letter to Constantius the Emperor, accused Vrsatius <a id="l1179"></a>&amp; Valens of a Confession made at Millain saying <a id="l1180"></a>that after they had been excommunicated upon sus<a id="l1181"></a>picion of Arianism they begged pardon &amp; were ab<a id="l1182"></a>solved at the Council of Millain before the Legates <a id="l1183"></a>of the Pope. But of this other Confession made two <a id="l1184"></a>years after at Rome upon occasion of the convening <a id="l1185"></a>of the Council of Sirmium they make no mention, tho <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span> that would have been much more material had it <a id="l1186"></a>been true.</p>
<p id="par55">7. Vrsatius &amp; Valens were excommunicated but <a id="l1187"></a>once, that is to say in the Council of Sardica &amp; <a id="l1188"></a>one excommunication admits of but one absolution</p>
<p id="par56">If you place the Council of Millain before <a id="l1189"></a>the Council of Sardica the first confession &amp; abso<a id="l1190"></a>lution will be before the western bishops ex<a id="l1191"></a>communicated any of the eastern for Arianism <a id="l1192"></a>&amp; the second before Athanasius went from Rome <a id="l1193"></a>into the east: both which are plainly absurd. ffor <a id="l1194"></a>the second confession was afterwards sent to Atha<a id="l1195"></a>nasius out of the west by Paulinus bishop of <a id="l1196"></a>Treves. And further the Council of Sardica in <a id="l1197"></a>their letters whereby they declare Valens &amp; <a id="l1198"></a>Vrsatius excommunicate for Arianism, would <a id="l1199"></a>have taken notice of their former excommuni<a id="l1200"></a>cation recantation &amp; absolution had there been <a id="l1201"></a>any such thing. But if you place the Council <a id="l1202"></a>of Millain after the Council of Sardica as you <a id="l1203"></a>ought to do, then Valens &amp; Vrsatius will re<a id="l1204"></a>cant, &amp; be absolved twice from one excommu<a id="l1205"></a>nication: &amp; which encreases the absurdity, the <a id="l1206"></a>Bishop of Rome alone will absolve them from <a id="l1207"></a>what a Council, where he himself was present <a id="l1208"></a>by his Legates, had absolved them before. ffor <a id="l1209"></a>their second recantation plainly respects the <a id="l1210"></a>proceedings of the Council of Sardica. So then <a id="l1211"></a> there is no place for this second recan<a id="l1212"></a>tation.</p>

<h2 id="hd16" class="cent">Quest. XI. <a id="l1213"></a><br>Whether Athanasius was falsly accused <a id="l1214"></a>or did falsly accuse Eusebius of adultery <a id="l1215"></a>before the Council of Tyre.</h2>
<p id="par57">Philostorgius<sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup> tells us that when Athanasius being impelled <a id="l1216"></a>by the Emperors threatning, came to Tyre, he would <a id="l1217"></a>not submit to stand in judgment, but sent in a <a id="l1218"></a>big-bellied woman which he had hired to accuse Eu<a id="l1219"></a>sebius of Adultery: hoping that by the tumult which <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018v"> &lt;18v&gt; </span> would probably be raised, he might escape being <a id="l1220"></a>tried. But when Eusebius asked her if she knew <a id="l1221"></a>the man &amp; whether he was amongst the Bishops <a id="l1222"></a>then present, she answered that she was not so <a id="l1223"></a>senseless as to accuse such men of base lust &amp; by <a id="l1224"></a>those words discovered the fraud. This story the <a id="l1225"></a>other Historians Sozomen &amp; Theodoret<sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> invert as if <a id="l1226"></a>the whore was hired by the Eusebians to accuse <a id="l1227"></a>Athanasius &amp; the fraud detected by one of Atha<a id="l1228"></a>nasius's friends to the confusion of his accusers <a id="l1229"></a>But this last story was unknown to Athanasius &amp; <a id="l1230"></a>his friends in the times next after the Council <a id="l1231"></a>of Tyre. For in the Letters of the Councils of <a id="l1232"></a>Alexandria, Rome &amp; Sardica, they mention it not <a id="l1233"></a>tho they omit nothing which made against that <a id="l1234"></a>Council: &amp; this story had it been true would have <a id="l1235"></a>made more against it then any thing else they say. <a id="l1236"></a>Nor does Athanasius mention it in all his works. <a id="l1237"></a>Whence I suspect his friends sometime after the <a id="l1238"></a>writing of his Apologies inverted the story of the <a id="l1239"></a>accusation.</p>

<h2 id="hd17" class="cent">Quest. XII. <a id="l1240"></a><br>Whether Athanasius did sincerely acquit <a id="l1241"></a>himself of the crime of breaking the com<a id="l1242"></a>munion cup of Ischyras.</h2>
<p id="par58">When Athanasius became bishop of Alexandria <a id="l1243"></a>he was soon accused of tyrannical behaviour to<a id="l1244"></a>wards the Meletians so as with his own hands <a id="l1245"></a>to break the communion cup of Ischyras a Mele<a id="l1246"></a>tian Presbyter in Mareote then performing sacred <a id="l1247"></a>rites &amp; to subvert the Altar &amp; cause the Church <a id="l1248"></a>to be demolished. This was the true accusation <a id="l1249"></a>as I find by the letter of the eighty eastern Bishops at Sar<a id="l1250"></a>dica recorded in Hilaries fragments.</p>
<p id="par59">On the other hand Athanasius &amp; his party <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span> represented that Ischyras was no Priest, the place <a id="l1251"></a>no church, the day not the Lords day; that Atha<a id="l1252"></a>nasius went not thither himself but only sent <a id="l1253"></a>Macarius who found Ischyras not celebrating the <a id="l1254"></a>sacrament but sick in bed &amp; charged him not <a id="l1255"></a>to proceed in those things; &amp; that Ischyras, so <a id="l1256"></a>soon as well, fled to the Meletians &amp; Eusebians <a id="l1257"></a>who thereupon composed the accusation. But were <a id="l1258"></a>this representation  the truth there could have been <a id="l1259"></a>no colour for framing an accusation. For cunning <a id="l1260"></a>men never venture to frame fals accusations <a id="l1261"></a>without some considerable colour of circumstances <a id="l1262"></a>handsomly laid together. The mystery therefore <a id="l1263"></a>I take to be this.</p>
<p id="par60">I find by a letter of Constantine the great <a id="l1264"></a>to Athanasius that Athanasius &amp; Macarius were <a id="l1265"></a>both of them accused: &amp; by the letter which the eighty <a id="l1266"></a>eastern Bishops wrote at Philippopolis compared <a id="l1267"></a>with some passages cited by Pope Iulius out of the <a id="l1268"></a>Acts of the Council of Tyre, that when indeed <a id="l1269"></a>Macarius was sent by Athanasius he found Ischy<a id="l1270"></a>ras sick in bed but that Athanasius was accused <a id="l1271"></a>for coming also himself when Ischyras was <a id="l1272"></a>administring the Eucharist &amp; for breaking the <a id="l1273"></a>communion cup &amp; overturning the altar <a id="l1274"></a>with his own hands. So then it seems (according to the <a id="l1275"></a>accusation) Macarius was sent first to forwarn <a id="l1276"></a>Ischyras of executing the office of a Presbyter; <a id="l1277"></a>&amp; afterwards when he would not desist, Atha<a id="l1278"></a>nasius coming at a time proper to find him in the <a id="l1279"></a>act overthrew the sacred things &amp; caused the place <a id="l1280"></a>to be demolished, Macarius perhaps assisting him. <a id="l1281"></a>Now the accusation lying only against this last Act <a id="l1282"></a>Athanasius to acquit himself confounds this time <a id="l1283"></a>with the former, &amp; undertakes to prove (not before <a id="l1284"></a>the Council of Tyre where the accusation was <a id="l1285"></a>understood; but amongst the credulous western Bishops <a id="l1286"></a>&amp; others of his own party) that Macarius went alone <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019v"> &lt;19v&gt; </span> without Athanasius &amp; found Ischyras sick in bed in a <a id="l1287"></a>place which was not a church on a day which was not <a id="l1288"></a>the Lords day &amp; only reproved him without breaking the communion cup &amp; subverting the sacred things: &amp;  by con<a id="l1289"></a>sequence that the accusation that Athanasius found <a id="l1290"></a>him on the Lord's day in a Church administring the Eu<a id="l1291"></a>charist &amp; subverted the sacred things was a figment. <a id="l1292"></a>Now if Athanasius shuffled in making this defence, it's <a id="l1293"></a>plain that he was gravelled and wanted a just defense. <a id="l1294"></a>Which is enough to decide the Question.</p>

<p id="par61">Sozomen<sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> tells us that in the Council of Tyre <a id="l1298"></a><em class="underline">Athanasius was accused by all in common that he ac<a id="l1299"></a>quired the Bishoprick by the perjury of certain <a id="l1300"></a>Bishops when all the Bishops had agreed before that <a id="l1301"></a>no man should be ordeined before they had ended <a id="l1302"></a>the brawls which were between them</em>. ffor Eusebius<sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup> <a id="l1303"></a>writes that when the Council of Nice was ended <a id="l1304"></a><em class="underline">there burned an implacable fury of contention <a id="l1305"></a>among the Egyptians</em>. And Socrates<sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup> tells us (out of <a id="l1306"></a>the letters of the Bishops written at that time) that <a id="l1307"></a>this contention was about the Nicene decree of the <a id="l1308"></a>word homousios, <em class="underline">those who disliked it thinking that <a id="l1309"></a>the opinion of Sabellius &amp; Montanus was introduced <a id="l1310"></a>by those who allowed it, &amp; therefore calling them <a id="l1311"></a>impious as if they took away the existence of the <a id="l1312"></a>Son of God, &amp; on the contrary those who allowed <a id="l1313"></a>this word thinking that the worship of many Gods <a id="l1314"></a>was introduced by their adversaries, &amp; therefore <a id="l1315"></a>shunning them as if they introduced the superstition <a id="l1316"></a>of the Gentiles</em>.</p>

Their words are these.<sup class="note" id="n27-ref">[27]</sup> <em class="underline">They</em> [viz<sup>t</sup> <a id="l1337"></a>the accusers of Athanasius] <em class="underline">say that after the <a id="l1338"></a>death of Alexander the Bishop, when some few <a id="l1339"></a>made mention of Athanasius, six or seven Bishops <a id="l1340"></a>ordained him secretly in a hidden place. These <a id="l1341"></a>things they wrote to the Emperor being not <a id="l1342"></a>ashamed to write any kind of lye.

Thus you see, while the Council would seem <a id="l1353"></a>to correct the acccusation in point of circumstances <a id="l1354"></a>they confess the sedition &amp; violence of the people <a id="l1355"></a>&amp; that the imprisoned Bishops resisted them many <a id="l1356"></a>days &amp; nights together before they would ordein <a id="l1357"></a>him, &amp; that all the people by whose violence <a id="l1358"></a>this was done were no more in number then one <a id="l1359"></a>of the little Churches built before the reign of <a id="l1360"></a>Constantine the great for the 12 Parishes of Alex<a id="l1361"></a>andria was able to hold.</p>
<p id="par63">Nor indeed was Athanasius capable of being <a id="l1362"></a>ordained, for he was but a Deacon, &amp; the Canon <a id="l1363"></a>constituted by Mark the Evangelist &amp; constantly ob<a id="l1364"></a>served till that time, was that there should be <a id="l1365"></a>twelve Presbyters of that Church, &amp; that out of them <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020v"> &lt;20v&gt; </span> the Bishop should be always elected.</p>
<p id="par64">And besides he was scarce of age for such a dig<a id="l1366"></a>nity. ffor he was then but a youth scarce 25 years <a id="l1367"></a>old. Whence the <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n28-ref">[28]</sup> Meletians used to cry: <em class="underline">O wicked<a id="l1368"></a>ness! He a Bishop or he a Boy</em>?</p>
<p id="par65">To palliate these things the Athanasians have <a id="l1369"></a>feigned as if Alexander upon his death bed re<a id="l1370"></a>commended Athanasius for his successor &amp; Athanasius <a id="l1371"></a>out of modesty then hid himself. But this as it <a id="l1372"></a>does not excuse the matter so it looks like a story <a id="l1373"></a>of later date. ffor the above-mentioned Council of <a id="l1374"></a>Alexandria knew nothing of it, tho composed of A<a id="l1375"></a>thanasius &amp; all his Bishops. ffor Athanasius convened <a id="l1376"></a>them in his own defense, &amp; in their Epistle where <a id="l1377"></a>they seem to omit nothing which made for his advantage <a id="l1378"></a>&amp; particularly defend his election, there is not a <a id="l1379"></a>word of this story.</p>
<p id="par66">By comparing all circumstances its more to be <a id="l1380"></a>suspected that Athanasius in the controversy between <a id="l1381"></a>the Clergy of Alexander about the Son of God, in<a id="l1382"></a>flamed differences, thereby to throw out part of <a id="l1383"></a>the Clergy &amp; make room for himself &amp; his friends: <a id="l1384"></a>&amp; when he had thus gotten to be Deacon, the re<a id="l1385"></a>putation &amp; interest he had got with  <a id="l1386"></a>his friends by that controversy served him to in<a id="l1387"></a>vade the Bishoprick. ffor when the people of his <a id="l1388"></a>party shutting up themselves with certain of the <a id="l1389"></a>Bishops in a Church, importuned those Bishops for <a id="l1390"></a>many days together to ordain him, I do not hear <a id="l1391"></a>that he sided with those Bishops against the people <a id="l1392"></a>This at least is certain, that the Bishops which ordein<a id="l1393"></a>ed him resisted for many days together &amp; were all <a id="l1394"></a>that time kept prisoners in a church by the Mob of <a id="l1395"></a>his party till they yeilded. And whereas his adversa<a id="l1396"></a>ries objected that those Bishops were forced to ordein <a id="l1397"></a>him contrary to their oaths; its observable that he <a id="l1398"></a>&amp; his Bishops in the Council of Alexandria make <a id="l1399"></a>no answer to that part of the Objection.</p>

The strange <a id="l1413"></a>heats at Nice between the Bishops, admonished the <a id="l1414"></a>Emperor to prevent the like at Tyre, &amp; if he had <a id="l1415"></a>not done so there could have been nothing but con<a id="l1416"></a>fusion, <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n29-ref">[29]</sup> Athanasius bringing a great multitude out of <a id="l1417"></a>Egypt to create disturbance &amp; behaving himself very <a id="l1418"></a>turbulantly in his tryall <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup> as the Council of Tyre in <a id="l1419"></a>their circulatory letters complained.</p>
<p id="par69">2. Its objected that at the examination of wit<a id="l1420"></a>nesses at Mariote there was present but one party. <a id="l1421"></a>The accuser Ischyras, say they, was there; but the <a id="l1422"></a>Defendents Athanasius &amp; Macarius were both absent <a id="l1423"></a>nor were any of the Presbyters of Athanasius allow<a id="l1424"></a>ed to be present at the examination thô they de<a id="l1425"></a>sired it. Well but if the accusers of Athanasius <a id="l1426"></a>brought several witnesses to Tyre as no doubt they <a id="l1427"></a>did &amp; after both parties had been heard face to <a id="l1428"></a>face the Council had a mind to give themselves the <a id="l1429"></a>outmost satisfaction by sending to the place such <a id="l1430"></a>persons as they thought fit, some to cite witnesses <a id="l1431"></a>others to take depositions, but none to act as Iudges <a id="l1432"></a>or accusers, &amp; if the Delegates at their return <a id="l1433"></a>acted the part of witnesses before the Council &amp; <a id="l1434"></a>the Council as Iudges heard the evidence of these <a id="l1435"></a>witnesses between Athanasius &amp; Ischyras; is the Coun<a id="l1436"></a>cil to be blamed for this? For that this was the true <a id="l1437"></a>case is manifest by the Letter of the Council of <a id="l1438"></a>Alexandria, wherein Athanasius &amp; the Egyptian <a id="l1439"></a>Bishops say that <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup> the Delegates of the Council of <a id="l1440"></a>Tyre were not ashamed of Iudges to become wit<a id="l1441"></a>nesses. Had Athanasius desired that witnesses might <a id="l1442"></a>be examined for him as well as against him, &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021v"> &lt;21v&gt; </span> that somebody might go on his behalf to cite the wit<a id="l1443"></a>nesses which were for him as well as Ischyras went to <a id="l1444"></a>cite the witnesses against him, the Council could not in <a id="l1445"></a>justice have denyed such a request. But he pretended <a id="l1446"></a>not to have any witnesses: for he &amp; his friends never com<a id="l1447"></a>plained that their witnesses were not examined. All <a id="l1448"></a>their complaint was that they were not admitted to <a id="l1449"></a>except against the witnesses of Ischyras, as being either <a id="l1450"></a>heathens or Catechumeni, or Arians or Meletians or <a id="l1451"></a>Colluthians, or persons suborned if orthodox, or any thing else then <a id="l1452"></a>the friends of Athanasius. ffor Athanasius &amp; his friends <a id="l1453"></a>exclaim against the Delegates for examining all those <a id="l1454"></a>sorts of people as if heathens were not as good witnesses <a id="l1455"></a>in matters of fact as any body else. So then whilst <a id="l1456"></a>Athanasius affirmed there was no Church demolished <a id="l1457"></a>no altar overturned, no cup broken, the day not <a id="l1458"></a>Sunday, the place no church &amp; he himself not <a id="l1459"></a>there, he could produce no witnesses to prove what <a id="l1460"></a>he affirmed but Ischyras produced many upon the <a id="l1461"></a>place to prove the contrary. The Presbyters of <a id="l1462"></a>Athanasius sent to the Council of Tyre in a letter <a id="l1463"></a>by some of their members all the evidence they <a id="l1464"></a> could &amp; that was only their own testimo<a id="l1465"></a>ny. This evidence (if men can give evidence in <a id="l1466"></a>their own cause) the Council of Tyre had before <a id="l1467"></a>them, to compare it with other evidence to the con<a id="l1468"></a>trary &amp; surely knew what stress to lay upon it. <a id="l1469"></a>So that I see not what was wanting to enable <a id="l1470"></a>them to judge righteously.</p>
<p id="par70">3. When the Legates returned from Tyre &amp; <a id="l1471"></a>Athanasius was fully heard &amp; condemned, he fled <a id="l1472"></a>from Tyre &amp; appealed to the Emperor Constantine <a id="l1473"></a>the great. Whereat the Emperor by an angry Let<a id="l1474"></a>ter summoned the Council to come &amp; give an <a id="l1475"></a>account of their proceedings. But they sent only <a id="l1476"></a>six Legates. And then the Emperor heard  all <a id="l1477"></a>the cause over again between Athanasius &amp; the Le<a id="l1478"></a>gates, approved the proceedings of the Council &amp; banished <a id="l1479"></a>Athanasius. Tis true that Athanasius represents that <a id="l1480"></a>the Legates feigned a new calumny against him <a id="l1481"></a>whereby the Emperor being incensed banished him in <a id="l1482"></a>a passion without hearing the cases of Arsenius &amp; <a id="l1483"></a>Ischyras: but the eighty eastern Bishops in the Letter <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022r"> &lt;22r&gt; </span> which in their return from Serdica they wrote at <a id="l1484"></a>Philippopolis to the Churches, say the contrary. For <a id="l1485"></a>relating how six Bishops who were sent to Mari<a id="l1486"></a>ote returned to Tyre &amp; confirmed the truth of the <a id="l1487"></a>accusations, they add. Vnde in præsentem Athanasi<a id="l1488"></a>um dignam pro criminibus sententiam [Patres] dicunt. <a id="l1489"></a>Propter quod Tyro fugiens Imperatorem appellat <a id="l1490"></a>Audit etiam Imperator, quique interrogatione habita <a id="l1491"></a>omnia ejus flagitia recognoscens, sua illum sen<a id="l1492"></a>tentia in exilium deportavit.</p>
<p id="par71">4. ffive years after was the Council of Alex<a id="l1493"></a>andria of eighty Bishops called by Athanasius <a id="l1494"></a>against the Council of Tyre: but whilst they <a id="l1495"></a>examined not the cause between Athanasius &amp; <a id="l1496"></a>his accusers nor sent to Mariote to examin <a id="l1497"></a>witnesses but relied on the feigned Letters of <a id="l1498"></a>Arsenius &amp; Ischyras &amp; such other reports as Atha<a id="l1499"></a>nasius &amp; some Presbyters of his party had spread abroad, but <a id="l1500"></a>never proved, &amp; whilst Athanasius himself (the party accused &amp; condemned) pre<a id="l1501"></a>sided in the Council &amp; most probably penned <a id="l1502"></a>their letter: what they did can amount to <a id="l1503"></a>nothing more then prejudice. Neither did the <a id="l1504"></a>Councils of Rome &amp; Serdica examin the cause <a id="l1505"></a>between Athanasius &amp; his accusers or send to <a id="l1506"></a>Mariote to inform themselves, but relied upon <a id="l1507"></a>the credit of the Council of  Alexandria <a id="l1508"></a>&amp; that of the Presbyters of Athanasius, &amp; were <a id="l1509"></a>also influenced by ambition, their designe being <a id="l1510"></a>to make the Pope universal Bishop, &amp; under him <a id="l1511"></a>to exercise jurisdiction over the Eastern Chur<a id="l1512"></a>ches. For the Pope summoned the Bishops of those <a id="l1513"></a>Churches to the Council of Rome to be judged &amp; <a id="l1514"></a>when they checkt him for his ambition &amp; refused <a id="l1515"></a>to come &amp; subject themselves the Council of <a id="l1516"></a>Rome absolved Athanasius without any judicial <a id="l1517"></a>process, as if the Eastern Bishops by not subjecting <a id="l1518"></a>themselves &amp; coming to plead had acknowledged <a id="l1519"></a>themselves guilty. Afterwards the Council of <a id="l1520"></a>Sardica proceeded upon the same ground, excom<a id="l1521"></a>municating the chief of the eastern Bishops <a id="l1522"></a>because they would not come to submit themselves <a id="l1523"></a>&amp; making a Decree that Appeals might be made <a id="l1524"></a>from all the world to the Pope. This intermixing <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022v"> &lt;22v&gt; </span> of the concern for the Vniversal Bishoprick puts <a id="l1525"></a>a prejudice upon the proceedings for Athanasius &amp; <a id="l1526"></a>makes them irregular &amp; voyd. And the prejudice <a id="l1527"></a>is increased by the case of Marcellus who was de<a id="l1528"></a>posed by the Eastern Bishops for heresy &amp; absol<a id="l1529"></a>ved &amp; justified by the Councils of Rome &amp; Sardi<a id="l1530"></a>ca &amp; yet afterwards acknowledged by all the <a id="l1531"></a>world to be guilty of the heresy for which he was deposed. Now if the Councils of Alexandria <a id="l1532"></a>Rome &amp; Sardica neither acted judicially nor <a id="l1533"></a>without prejudice, then has there been nothing <a id="l1534"></a>done to dissolve the judgment of the Council of <a id="l1535"></a>Tyre &amp; therefore that Council is still in force.</p>
<p id="par72">5 The proceedings against Athanasius are <a id="l1536"></a>further cleared by a proposal made at the Coun<a id="l1537"></a>cil of Sardica by five of the six Bishops which <a id="l1538"></a>were sent from Tyre to Mareote, namely that <a id="l1539"></a>an equal number of Bishops should be sent by <a id="l1540"></a>both parties to the places where Athanasius had <a id="l1541"></a>committed his crimes to examin things anew, <a id="l1542"></a>&amp; if the report which those five had made <a id="l1543"></a>to the Council of Tyre appeared to be false <a id="l1544"></a>they would stand excommunicated without complain<a id="l1545"></a>ing to any body; but if it were found true, <a id="l1546"></a>then five of those Bishops who abetted Atha<a id="l1547"></a>nasius should be excommunicated &amp; complain to <a id="l1548"></a>no body. But this equal condition, the friends of <a id="l1549"></a>Athanasius durst not accept of.</p>
<p id="par73">6. About six years after the Council of <a id="l1550"></a>Sardica, viz<sup>t</sup> A.C. 353 Constantius being now Empe<a id="l1551"></a>rour of both East &amp; West called a Council at Arles <a id="l1552"></a>in Gallia to have the condemnation of Athanasius <a id="l1553"></a>subscribed &amp; for that end <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup> by a courteous Letter sent by <a id="l1554"></a>Montanus invited Athanasius to his presence, <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup> designing <a id="l1555"></a>that his cause should be heard anew before this <a id="l1556"></a>Council for the satisfaction of the Western Bishops. <a id="l1557"></a>But Athanasius <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> declined the judgment as he had done <a id="l1558"></a>that of the Council of Cæsarea before in the reign <a id="l1559"></a>of Constantine the great. In this Council <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> the Popes <a id="l1560"></a>Legates Vincentius of Capua &amp; Marcellus proposed that <a id="l1561"></a>for the peace of the Churches they were ready to sub<a id="l1562"></a>scribe the condemnation of Athanasius provided the Here<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023r"> &lt;23r&gt; </span>sy of Arius might be first condemned. But being told <a id="l1563"></a>that  it belong<a id="l1564"></a>ed not to them to prescribe the order of things or to go <a id="l1565"></a>upon other business then what the Emperor had conve<a id="l1566"></a>ned them for, all the Council subscribed except Pau<a id="l1567"></a>linus of Treves who was therefore banished. And <a id="l1568"></a>thereupon Pope Liberius <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n36-ref">[36]</sup> in an epistle to Hosius <a id="l1569"></a>complained that he beleived that the Gospel of God <a id="l1570"></a>might have been preserved by his Legate Vincen<a id="l1571"></a>tius but yet he not only failed of obteining the pro<a id="l1572"></a>posals he was to insist on, but was brought over to <a id="l1573"></a>subscribe. Two years after this, another Council <a id="l1574"></a>was called at Millain of 300 Bishops &amp;  <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n37-ref">[37]</sup> Diogenes <a id="l1577"></a>was sent to bring Athanasius by force, but being <a id="l1578"></a>resisted by the people returned without him. In <a id="l1579"></a>this Council therefore the Bishops all subscribed <a id="l1580"></a>readily except Lucifer Calaritanus the Popes Le<a id="l1581"></a>gate &amp; Eusebius Vercellensis. Eusebius <sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup> laid down <a id="l1582"></a>before the Council the Nicene creed promising to <a id="l1583"></a>do what they desired if that were first subscribed: <a id="l1584"></a>but when the sentence of <sup>k</sup><sup class="note" id="n39-ref">[39]</sup> Athanasius was insisted <a id="l1585"></a>on as the business of the Council, he preswaded Di<a id="l1586"></a>onysius of Millan that the Nicene faith was struck <a id="l1587"></a>at, &amp; fraudulently procured his name to be wiped <a id="l1588"></a>out of the subscriptions. Whereupon these three <a id="l1589"></a>were banished. In the beginning of the next year <a id="l1590"></a>Syrianus  being sent with an armed force to <a id="l1591"></a>take Athanasius &amp; place George in his room, after <a id="l1592"></a>he had staid a while at Alexandria attempted to <a id="l1593"></a>take him, &amp; the same year a Council was called <a id="l1594"></a>at Bituris in Gallia. But Athanasius after some <a id="l1595"></a>resistance escaped &amp; the Bishops now convened <a id="l1596"></a>subscribed his condemnation except Hilary &amp; Rhoda<a id="l1597"></a>nius <sup>m</sup><sup class="note" id="n40-ref">[40]</sup> who promised to subscribe if the Nicene faith <a id="l1598"></a>were first ratified; but for refusing otherwise to <a id="l1599"></a>subscribe they were banished. The next year Ho<a id="l1600"></a>sius subscribed at Sirmium but Liberius Bishop of <a id="l1601"></a>Rome suffered two years banishment &amp; then sent <a id="l1602"></a><sup>n</sup><sup class="note" id="n41-ref">[41]</sup> a Letter of submission to the Oriental Bishops, in <a id="l1603"></a>which he writes thus. <em class="underline">Ego Athanasium non de<a id="l1604"></a>fendo, sed quia susceperat illum bonæ memoriæ <a id="l1605"></a>Iulius Episcopus decessor meus, verebar ne forte <a id="l1606"></a>ab aliquo prævaricator judicarer.

So then <a id="l1608"></a>Athanasius was now condemned by all the West ex<a id="l1609"></a>cept six Bishops, &amp; even those in not insisting at <a id="l1610"></a>all upon his innocence,<sup class="note" id="n42-ref">[42]</sup> but only objecting the danger <a id="l1611"></a>of the faith &amp; proposing to condemn him provided the <a id="l1612"></a>Nicene faith might be first confirmed, did really con<a id="l1613"></a>demn him. ffor this was as much as to say, that they <a id="l1614"></a>beleived him guilty but did not think it safe to sub<a id="l1615"></a>scribe his condemnation before the Nicene faith was <a id="l1616"></a>confirmed. So then all the West, as well the six Bish<a id="l1617"></a>ops which were banished as all the rest did freely condemn <a id="l1618"></a>him in their judgments even before they consented to subscribe <a id="l1619"></a>his condemnation. By making this proposal they all <a id="l1620"></a>sufficiently confest that they had not seen Arsenius <a id="l1621"></a>alive nor could prove that he had been seen alive <a id="l1622"></a>either at Tyre or any where else, nor that the <a id="l1623"></a>Mareotick Acts were false. By this they declined in<a id="l1624"></a>sisting upon the innocence of Athanasius &amp; discover<a id="l1625"></a>ed that they durst not rely upon it. By this they <a id="l1626"></a>confest that they had formerly defended him upon <a id="l1627"></a>other considerations then his innocence &amp; that in their <a id="l1628"></a>consciences they were satisfied that they might <a id="l1629"></a>justly &amp; according to the Ecclesiastical Canons subscribe <a id="l1630"></a>to his condemnation tho not safely till those other <a id="l1631"></a>considerations were removed.</p>
<p id="par74">7. And if it was not enough for Athanasius to <a id="l1632"></a>be thus condemned by all the world,  it may <a id="l1633"></a>be considered whether he was not also condemned by <a id="l1634"></a>himself. For if the Council of Cæsarea was convened <a id="l1635"></a>by Constantine the great to hear his cause &amp; he would <a id="l1636"></a>not go thither thô commanded by the Emperor, &amp; the <a id="l1637"></a>Council waited long for his coming; if the next <a id="l1638"></a>year being threatned by the Emperor he came to <a id="l1639"></a> the Council of Tyre unwillingly &amp; brought <a id="l1640"></a>with him a great multitude to create disturbances <a id="l1641"></a>that judgment might not proceed; if when he came <a id="l1642"></a>there he refused to stand in judgment  <a id="l1643"></a>(all which the Council of Tyre represented <sup>p</sup><sup class="note" id="n43-ref">[43]</sup> in their <a id="l1644"></a>circulatory Letters;) if in like manner he refused <a id="l1645"></a>to appear  at the bar of the western Councils &amp; when the <a id="l1646"></a>Emperor sent an armed power to bring him he resisted <a id="l1647"></a>that power &amp; fled, &amp; if also both before &amp; after <a id="l1648"></a>judgment he feigned several stories &amp; Letters to <a id="l1649"></a>justify himself; &amp; if flying from justice &amp; feigning <a id="l1650"></a>false excuses be arguments of a guilty conscience: <a id="l1651"></a>we must allow that Athanasius by doing these things <a id="l1652"></a>has betrayd himself guilty. The very feigning of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024r"> &lt;24r&gt; </span> Letters &amp; stories undermines  &amp; overthrows all <a id="l1653"></a>that  was ever said or done for his justifica<a id="l1654"></a>tion either by himself or others. ffor it resolves <a id="l1655"></a>all his defense into a figment; &amp; such a defense <a id="l1656"></a>when detected is equipollent to a confession of <a id="l1657"></a>guilt.</p>

It's true <a id="l1710"></a>Athanasius laid the crime upon the friends of <a id="l1711"></a> Gregory: but whether the Gregorians burnt a Church <a id="l1712"></a>&amp; defac't an altar they were to use themselves <a id="l1713"></a> &amp; must repair or the Athanasians defaced &amp; burnt what they <a id="l1714"></a>could use no longer, I leave to the Readers judgment.</p>
<p id="par80">When Athanasius was thus displaced, he wrote <a id="l1715"></a>a circulatory Letter to all his friends to stirr them <a id="l1716"></a>up to sedition &amp; revenge. The Letter beginns thus.</p>

<p id="par81">The things we have suffered are grievous &amp; in<a id="l1719"></a>tollerable &amp; cannot be sufficiently declared; but yet <a id="l1720"></a>that I may in brief express their grievousness, it's <a id="l1721"></a>proper to remind you of a history out of sacred <a id="l1722"></a>writ. A Levite being injured in his wife &amp; reflecting <a id="l1723"></a>upon the greatness of the indignity …… sent her body <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025r"> &lt;25r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">cut in pieces to all the Tribes of Israel, that they <a id="l1724"></a>might look upon this common injury as done not only <a id="l1725"></a>to him but to them all &amp; that either if they com<a id="l1726"></a>passionated his case they might revenge it or else <a id="l1727"></a>if they neglected the wickedness they might be a<a id="l1728"></a>shamed. Now the messengers told the fact &amp; they <a id="l1729"></a>that heard &amp; saw it said there was never any such <a id="l1730"></a>thing done since Israel came out of Egypt. Therefore <a id="l1731"></a>all the Tribes were moved &amp; all of them as if each <a id="l1732"></a>had suffered were gathered together. In conclusion, they <a id="l1733"></a>that had committed this wickedness were invaded &amp; con<a id="l1734"></a>quered &amp; made an anathema by all. For they that <a id="l1735"></a>came together respected not the kindred of the trans<a id="l1736"></a>gressors but the wickedness. You know the story bre<a id="l1737"></a>thren &amp; what is reported in the scriptures concern<a id="l1738"></a>ing it, &amp; I will say no more of it seing I write to <a id="l1739"></a>them that know it &amp; am earnest to shew you things <a id="l1740"></a>which transcend these.

<div>
<p id="par82">And this is enough to let you see the spirit of <a id="l1776"></a>the man. For this shews plainly how for the sake <a id="l1777"></a>of a Bishoprick he laboured to set the whole Roman <a id="l1778"></a>world on a flame, to make a schism between the eastern <a id="l1779"></a>&amp; western churches &amp; to raise a civil war against <a id="l1780"></a>his own Emperor. ffor this end therefore he fled from <a id="l1781"></a>Alexandria to Rome &amp; ceased not to incense the west<a id="l1782"></a>ern Bishops till by their interest with the Western <a id="l1783"></a>Emperor Constans, he procured a Council to be called <a id="l1784"></a>at Sardica wherein 'twas designed that the eastern <a id="l1785"></a>Bishops should stand at the Bar as criminals &amp; be judg<a id="l1786"></a>ed by the western in order to their subversion. And <a id="l1787"></a>when this usurpation would not be yeilded unto but <a id="l1788"></a>ended in that schism between the east &amp; west which <a id="l1789"></a>Athanasius &amp; his Alexandrine Council sollicited: he <a id="l1790"></a>ceased not till by the same interest the Emperor <a id="l1791"></a>Constans was prevailed with to threaten a civil war <a id="l1792"></a>upon his brother Constantius unless he would restore <a id="l1793"></a>Athanasius. Thus did this Egyptian Levite go on <a id="l1794"></a>to revenge the loss of his deare Spouse the Bishopric <a id="l1795"></a>of Alexandria, but the Eastern Bishops being men <a id="l1796"></a>of a more Christian temper advised their Emperor <a id="l1797"></a>to peace &amp; so Athanasius was again restored to <a id="l1798"></a>the mistress of his affections.</p>
<p id="par83">One would think he was now sufficiently re<a id="l1799"></a>venged of his Emperor, &amp; yet this great spirit <a id="l1800"></a>stopt not here, but afterwards sollicited the Tyrant <a id="l1801"></a>Magnentius by a letter: which letter after the ruin <a id="l1802"></a>&amp; death of that Tyrant was found amongst his <a id="l1803"></a>papers. Athanasius indeed in his first Apology saith <a id="l1804"></a>this Letter was not written by him but feigned by them <a id="l1805"></a>that found it: but he that could feign other mens letters <a id="l1806"></a>could deny his own. In this Apology  he answers <a id="l1807"></a>three Objections, the first that he had stirred up the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span> western Emperor Constans against his own Emperor <a id="l1808"></a>Constantius, the second that he had endeavoured also <a id="l1809"></a>by that Letter to stirr up Magnentius against him <a id="l1810"></a>&amp; the third that he did not afterwards come into <a id="l1811"></a>the west when the Emperor sent for him, but resisted the <a id="l1812"></a>messengers. All these things were seditious in a very <a id="l1813"></a>high  degree &amp;  he endeavours to acquit him <a id="l1814"></a>self of them by  answering to the first that he <a id="l1815"></a>did not stir up Constans, to the second that he <a id="l1816"></a>did not write that Letter &amp; to the third that he <a id="l1817"></a>did not know it was the Emperors will that he <a id="l1818"></a>should come into the west, the first of three Mes<a id="l1819"></a>sengers which were sent for him delivering (as <a id="l1820"></a>he represents) a lying letter from the Empe<a id="l1821"></a>ror, the next delivering none at all.  This was his insincere way of answering. <a id="l1823"></a>ffor what ever he pretends I must beleive that he <a id="l1824"></a>who wrote two publick circulatory Letters to stir <a id="l1825"></a>up the western Empire against the Eastern did <a id="l1826"></a>endeavour also privately to stir it up, &amp;  that <a id="l1827"></a> as well in the reign of Magnentius as in that <a id="l1828"></a>of Constans. For they who found his letter to Mag<a id="l1829"></a>nentius amongst the papers of that Tyrant were <a id="l1830"></a>good witnesses against him &amp; his denyal of the fact <a id="l1831"></a>amounts to no more then a Prisoners pleading <a id="l1832"></a>not guilty to invalidate the evidence of good <a id="l1833"></a>witnesses. I must beleive also that he who refused <a id="l1834"></a>to obey Constantine the great was as refractory <a id="l1835"></a>to Constantius, as Sozomen tells us he really was.<sup class="note" id="n47-ref">[47]</sup> <a id="l1836"></a>For to me it seems incredible that Constantius <a id="l1837"></a>should assemble two Councils in the west to hear <a id="l1838"></a>his cause &amp; send for him thrice, first by a messenger <a id="l1839"></a>with a Letter &amp; then by two other successive <a id="l1840"></a>messengers with armed forces &amp; he resist those forces <a id="l1841"></a>&amp; yet not understand all this while that he <a id="l1842"></a>was sent for. The relation of Sozomen<sup class="note" id="n48-ref">[48]</sup> therefore <a id="l1843"></a>I rather take to be true, which was as follows</p>
<p id="par84">When the first Messenger [Montanus] brought <a id="l1844"></a>the Emperors Letters, Athanasius &amp; his friends <a id="l1845"></a>were extreamly troubled, thinking it not safe for <a id="l1846"></a>him to go nor without danger for him to stay. <a id="l1847"></a>But the advice for his staying prevailed &amp; so <a id="l1848"></a>the Messenger returned without doing his business. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026v"> &lt;26v&gt; </span> The next summer [or rather, as Athanasius saith, after <a id="l1849"></a>26 months] another messenger [Diogenes] being sent from <a id="l1850"></a>the Emperor &amp; coming with the Rectors of the Pro<a id="l1851"></a>vince, forced Athanasius from the City &amp; made a <a id="l1852"></a>sharp war upon his Clergy. But when the people <a id="l1853"></a>of Alexandria resumed courage, this messenger also <a id="l1854"></a>seing the people prepared to fight returned without <a id="l1855"></a>compassing his message. Not long after the Roman Legi<a id="l1856"></a>ons were called out of Egypt &amp; Libya [to Alexandria <a id="l1857"></a>by Syrianus the chief commander] &amp; it being told that <a id="l1858"></a>Athanasius was hid in the Church called Theon, Syria<a id="l1859"></a>nus &amp; Hilary who was sent to hasten this business, <a id="l1860"></a>taking the soldiers brake into the Church suddenly <a id="l1861"></a>at an unexpected time of the night to seek for Atha<a id="l1862"></a>nasius but found him not. Thus far Sozomen. Atha<a id="l1863"></a>nasius represents that he &amp; his people were passing <a id="l1864"></a>the night together in devotion but by a Letter which <a id="l1865"></a>they wrote four days after (viz<sup>t</sup> the last day of Ia<a id="l1866"></a>nuary) to all the people under Athanasius to stirr <a id="l1867"></a>them up to their assistance, I find that they re<a id="l1868"></a>sisted the soldiers &amp; by consequence were armed <a id="l1869"></a>to guard their Bishop &amp; that they kept the Church <a id="l1870"></a>by force &amp; there hung up the arms of the vanquish<a id="l1871"></a>ed soldiers in triumph. Which is a notable instance <a id="l1872"></a>of the seditious spirit of Athanasius &amp; his followers. <a id="l1873"></a>The Letter is in the works of Athanasius p. 866, &amp; <a id="l1874"></a>begins thus.</p>

<h2 id="hd23" class="cent">Quest. XVI. <a id="l2023"></a><br>Whether Constantius persecuted <a id="l2024"></a>the Athanasians for religion or only <a id="l2025"></a>punished them for immorality.</h2>
<p id="par89">What sort of Martyrs &amp; Confessors those were which Atha<a id="l2026"></a>nasius so much celebrates in his works, you have already <a id="l2027"></a>heard &amp; may further understand by what Athanasius says <a id="l2028"></a>of them in his epistle to the Moncks, where speaking first <a id="l2029"></a>of the Bishops which were banished before the above-mention<a id="l2030"></a>ed skirmish in the wilderness &amp; then of the Bishops of all <a id="l2031"></a>Egypt Libya &amp; Pentapolis which in that skirmish were <a id="l2032"></a>partly put to flight &amp; partly taken prisoners &amp; those banished <a id="l2033"></a>who would not submit, he saith.<sup class="note" id="n52-ref">[52]</sup> <em class="underline">Be it that against Atha<a id="l2034"></a>nasius &amp; the other Bishops which they have banished <a id="l2035"></a> they could feign false pretenses of <a id="l2036"></a>crimes, yet those things are nothing to this new kind of evil. <a id="l2037"></a>For what crime could they feigne against all Egypt <a id="l2038"></a>Libya &amp; Pentapolis? For they have not attempted them <a id="l2039"></a>severally that they might be able to feign fals accusations <a id="l2040"></a>but have set upon all together, so that if they should <a id="l2041"></a>feign any thing they should presently be condemned for ly<a id="l2042"></a>ars</em>. To the same purpose Athanasius has another <a id="l2043"></a>passage in this Epistle.<sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> <em class="underline">Be it</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">that they have <a id="l2044"></a>made Athanasius a criminal yet what have the other Bish<a id="l2045"></a>ops done? What pretenses of crimes have they against them? <a id="l2046"></a>What Arsenius was killed by them? or what Macarius or</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p029r"> &lt;29r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">broken cup are they concerned in? Or what Mele<a id="l2047"></a>tian acts a part? Therefore by the things laid to their <a id="l2048"></a>charge those objected against Athanasius are shewed <a id="l2049"></a>to be false; &amp; mutually by what has been framed <a id="l2050"></a>against Athanasius, it is manifest that the things a<a id="l2051"></a>gainst them are feigned</em>. These passages sufficiently shew that the <a id="l2052"></a>best of Athanasius's martyrs &amp; confessors suffered as evil <a id="l2053"></a>doers &amp; seditious persons, &amp; that Constantius &amp; his bishops <a id="l2054"></a>studiously avoided punishing them for their faith, &amp; that <a id="l2055"></a>rather then do it they chose to feigne fals accusations <a id="l2056"></a>if you will beleive Athanasius.</p>
<p id="par90">Now by the Egyptian martyrs &amp; confessors you may <a id="l2057"></a>know what those were in other places: of all which Lucifer <a id="l2058"></a>Calaritanus<sup class="note" id="n54-ref">[54]</sup> gives you the following account in speaking <a id="l2059"></a>thus to Constantius. <em class="underline">Mactasti quamplurimos in Alexandria, <a id="l2060"></a>laniasti certos toto in orbe, disperdisti resistentes tibi varijs <a id="l2061"></a>in locis. Sed hi omnes, quod tu audire minime vis, martyres <a id="l2062"></a>sunt: illos omnes beatissimos tuo mactatos gladio in pa</em><a id="l2063"></a>radiso esse credimus. Thus you see the martyrs of <a id="l2064"></a>the Athanasians for which Constantius is in history <a id="l2065"></a>recorded a persecutor, were such as perished by the sword <a id="l2066"></a>in resisting the higher powers</p>
<p id="par91">To these you may add the six or seven bishops  who were banished for not subscribing the condem<a id="l2068"></a>nation of Athanasius. For they were deposed by Councils <a id="l2069"></a>of their own religion, &amp; therefore suffered not for their <a id="l2070"></a>faith. They endeavoured to keep up a schism between the <a id="l2071"></a>eastern &amp; western Churches, &amp; so were banished as ene<a id="l2072"></a>mies to peace. They refused to debate upon those matters <a id="l2073"></a>for which the Emperor called the Councils unless they <a id="l2074"></a>might have their own matters first dispatcht, &amp; so suffer<a id="l2075"></a>ed as polyticians for usurping upon the Emperors right. <a id="l2076"></a>They profered to comply if the Nicene creed  were first <a id="l2077"></a>ratified &amp; so acknowledged it lawfull to comply &amp; by con<a id="l2078"></a>sequence were banished for resisting the higher powers where <a id="l2079"></a>it was their duty to obey</p>
<p id="par92">So Soon  as the Councils of Ariminum &amp; Seleucia were <a id="l2080"></a>over, Athanasius &amp; his friends falling into a rage at <a id="l2081"></a>the Emperors success, began to write railing books a<a id="l2082"></a>gainst him; &amp; Athanasius indeed laboured to perswade <a id="l2083"></a>the Egyptians  that the Emperor <a id="l2084"></a>overcame the western bishops by tyrannical asperity <a id="l2085"></a>&amp; terror; &amp; yet the contrary is certainly true. For <a id="l2086"></a>Hilary,<sup class="note" id="n55-ref">[55]</sup> in a railing book which he wrote at that very <a id="l2087"></a>time against the Emperor attributes the success to his <a id="l2088"></a>clemency. He calls this book a confession, &amp; wishes that <a id="l2089"></a>he had wrote it in the reign of Nero or Dioclesian that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p029v"> &lt;29v&gt; </span> he might have suffered for it. For, saith he, I could <a id="l2090"></a>have endured any death whether to be sawn in pieces <a id="l2091"></a>with Isaiah, or burnt with the three children, or crucified, <a id="l2092"></a>or cast into the Sea: &amp; then he goes on in these words. <a id="l2093"></a>Adversus enim absolutos hostes felix mihi illud certamen <a id="l2094"></a>fuisset, quia nec dubium relinqueretur quin persecutores <a id="l2095"></a>essent qui ad negandum te pænis, ferro, igni compellerent, <a id="l2096"></a>neque ad testificandum plus tibi nos quam mortes nostras <a id="l2097"></a>liceret impendere. Pugnaremus enim in palam &amp; cum <a id="l2098"></a>fiducia contra negantes, contra torquentes, contra jugulan<a id="l2099"></a>tes: et nos populi tui tanquam duces suos ad confessionis <a id="l2100"></a>religionem intelligentia persecutionis publicæ comitarentur. <a id="l2101"></a>At nunc pugnamus contra persecutorem fallentem, contra <a id="l2102"></a>hostem blandientem, contra Constantium Antichristum, <a id="l2103"></a>qui non dorsa cædit, sed ventrem palpat; non proscribit <a id="l2104"></a>ad vitam sed ditat ad mortem: non trudit carcere ad <a id="l2105"></a>libertatem sed intra palatium honorat ad servitutem: <a id="l2106"></a>non latera vexat sed cor occupat: non caput gladio <a id="l2107"></a>desecat, sed animam auro occidit: non contendit ne <a id="l2108"></a>vincatur, sed adulatur ut dominetur: Christum confite<a id="l2109"></a>tur ut neget: unitatem procurat ne pax sit: hæreses <a id="l2110"></a>comprimit ne Christiani sint: Ecclesiæ tecta struit ut <a id="l2111"></a>fidem destruat. All which is as much as to say that Constan<a id="l2112"></a>tius persecuted not the men but the faith, &amp; did it not <a id="l2113"></a>by tortures, proscriptions prisons &amp; deaths, but by deceiving <a id="l2114"></a>flattering tickling enriching &amp; honouring the western <a id="l2115"></a>clergy &amp; building their churches. And to the same pur<a id="l2116"></a>pose he adds a little after. <sup class="note" id="n56-ref">[56]</sup>Omnia sævissima sine invidia <a id="l2117"></a>gloriosarum mortium peragis. Novo inauditoque ingenij <a id="l2118"></a>triumpho de diabolo vincis et sine martyrio persequeris. <a id="l2119"></a>Plus crudelitati vestræ Nero, Deci, Maximiane debemus: <a id="l2120"></a>Diabolum enim per vos vicimus &amp;c. At tu omnium cru<a id="l2121"></a>delitatum crudelissime damno majore in nos et venia <a id="l2122"></a>minore desævis. Subrepis nomine blandientis, occidis specie <a id="l2123"></a>religionis, impietatem peragis, Christi fidem Christi mendax <a id="l2124"></a>prædicator extinguis. Non relinquis saltem miseris excusati<a id="l2125"></a>ones, ut æterno judici suo pænas et aliquas laniatorum <a id="l2126"></a>corporum præferant cicatrices: ut infirmitas defendat <a id="l2127"></a>necessitatem. Scelestissime mortalium omnia ita tempe<a id="l2128"></a>ras ut excludas et in peccato veniam et in confessione <a id="l2129"></a>martyrium. Sed hæc ille pater tuus artifex humanarum <a id="l2130"></a>mortium docuit, vincere sine contumacia, jugulare sine gladio, <a id="l2131"></a>persequi sine infamia, odire sine suspicione, mentiri sine <a id="l2132"></a>intelligentia, profiteri sine fide, blandiri sine bonitate, agere <a id="l2133"></a>quid velis nec manifestare quæ velis. Thus does Hilary <a id="l2134"></a>in one &amp; the same breath rail at Constantius as the most <a id="l2135"></a>cruel of persecutors, &amp; yet declare that his <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>persecution<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> consisted in nothing <a id="l2136"></a>but love &amp; kindness. By this means he had better success <a id="l2137"></a>then the heathen persecutors by violence, &amp; therefore was in <a id="l2138"></a>Hilary's opinion more cruel, not to the bodies but to the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030r"> &lt;30r&gt; </span> souls of men. Hilary therefore finding himself deserted <a id="l2139"></a>by almost all the world, &amp; being thereby reduced to despair, <a id="l2140"></a>wrote this railing book, &amp; to provoke the Emperor to kill <a id="l2141"></a>him presented it to him at Constantinople A.C. 360 (as <a id="l2142"></a>Baronius shews)<sup class="note" id="n57-ref">[57]</sup> hoping thereby to fix the name of persecutor <a id="l2143"></a>upon him &amp; that of martyr upon himself. But altho this <a id="l2144"></a>railery was crimen læsæ majestatis, &amp; in that government <a id="l2145"></a>punishable with death: yet the Emperor was so far from <a id="l2146"></a>being provoked to do any thing which might but look like <a id="l2147"></a>persecution that on the contrary he thereupon released <a id="l2148"></a>Hilary out of  banishment &amp; licensed him to return <a id="l2149"></a>home into Gallia, thus endeavouring to overcome evil <a id="l2150"></a>with good.</p>
<p id="par93">How far this Emperor was from being a persecutor <a id="l2151"></a>is further manifested by a story told of him by Gregory <a id="l2152"></a>Naziansen which in the words of his Interpreter is as follows.</p>
<div class="lg">

<p class="l"><sup class="note" id="n58-ref">[58]</sup> Constantium autem (nam referre hoc convenit</p>

<p id="par94">The same Gregory Nazianzen also in his first Oration <a id="l2153"></a>against Iulian thus expostulates with the soul of the deceased <a id="l2154"></a>Constantius for making Iulian Emperor. Quid tibi accidit, O <a id="l2155"></a>Imperatorum divinissime Christique amantissime (eo enim pro<a id="l2156"></a>vehor ut tecum velut cum præsente atque audiente expostu<a id="l2157"></a>lem, etsi multò præstantiorem te esse scio quam ut a me <a id="l2158"></a>reprehendi debeas, utpote qui Deo adjunctus sis, cælestisque <a id="l2159"></a>gloriæ hæreditatem acceperis atque in tantum a nobis mi<a id="l2160"></a>graris ut imperium cum meliore commutares,) quodnam <a id="l2161"></a>hoc consilium suscepisti, qui omnes non tuæ solum sed <a id="l2162"></a>etiam superioris memoriæ Imperatores animi solertia &amp; <a id="l2163"></a>acumine longe antecellebas? And a little after excu<a id="l2164"></a>sing Constantius for doing this, he saith: Cum benignita<a id="l2165"></a>tem dixi id aperte dixi quod eum crimine omni ac culpa <a id="l2166"></a>liberet. Cui enim vel ex ijs quibus non perinde cognitus <a id="l2167"></a>erat, dubium est quin ipse ob pietatem amoremque erga <a id="l2168"></a>nos ac propensissimam bene de nobis merendi voluntatem, <a id="l2169"></a>non modo illum [sc. Iulianum] aut totius generis honorem <a id="l2170"></a>imperijque incrementum neglexisset, verum imperio quoque <a id="l2171"></a>ipsi omnibusque fortunis, atque ipsi denique vitæ qua nemini <a id="l2172"></a>quicquam est charius, incollumitatem nostram ac salutem <a id="l2173"></a>haud illibenti animo prætulisset. Neque enim usquam unquam <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030v"> &lt;30v&gt; </span> ullius rei tam acri amore atque cupidate correptus est, <a id="l2174"></a>quam ille Christianos crescere atque in summam gloriæ <a id="l2175"></a>potentiæque amplitudinem pervenire cupiebat. Ac neque <a id="l2176"></a>domitæ et subactæ gentes nec respublica præclaris <a id="l2177"></a>legibus constituta &amp; gubernata nec pecuniarum copia, <a id="l2178"></a>nec gloriæ magnitudo, nec quod rex regum et esset et <a id="l2179"></a>appellaretur, nec omnia alia quibus hominum felicitas <a id="l2180"></a>declaratur, nec denique quicquam ex omnibus rebus <a id="l2181"></a>tantum ipsi voluptatis afferebat, quantum ut et nos per <a id="l2182"></a>ipsum et per nos ipse túm apud Deum tum apud homines <a id="l2183"></a>floreremus ac firma semper et stabilis nobis potentia <a id="l2184"></a>permaneret. –––––––– Qui quidem et siquid nobis molestiæ  <a id="l2185"></a>exhibuit, non nostri contemptu id fecit nec ut nos <a id="l2186"></a>contumelia afficeret aut quod alijs quibusdam potius <a id="l2187"></a>quam nobis commendare cuperet: sed ut omnes in <a id="l2188"></a>unum coiremus, animorumque consensione jungeremur <a id="l2189"></a>nec per schismata inter nos dirempti atque dissecti essemus. <a id="l2190"></a>Thus far Gregory. And this testimony coming freely from <a id="l2191"></a>the mouth of an enemy &amp; an eye-witness of things, is <a id="l2192"></a>as great as can be desired. So Libanius a heathen &amp; <a id="l2193"></a>therefore another enemy, gives him the same character. <a id="l2194"></a>For in his Oration called Basiliscus, after he had described <a id="l2195"></a>the behaviour of Constantius in war, he goes on thus. <a id="l2196"></a>Verum cum adeo illustris esset in armis, longe præstantior <a id="l2197"></a>alijs in rebus quam in bellicis fuit: ut de eo enunciare <a id="l2198"></a>liceat, Rex probus hic, bellator et acer. Non enim eò <a id="l2199"></a>se tum meliorem quam alij visum iri autumabat cum <a id="l2200"></a>magis quam cæteri sæviret, sed si magis quam alij <a id="l2201"></a>clementia gavisus, omnes nihilo secius superaret, &amp;c. <a id="l2202"></a>In short, the vertues of this Emperor were so illustrious <a id="l2203"></a>that I do not find a better character given of any Prince <a id="l2204"></a>for clemency, temperance, chastity, contempt of popular <a id="l2205"></a>fame, affection to Christianity, justice, prudence, princely <a id="l2206"></a>carriage &amp; good government, then is given to him even <a id="l2207"></a>by his very enemies. He kept up the imperial dignity <a id="l2208"></a>of his person to the height &amp; yet reigned in the hearts <a id="l2209"></a>of his people, &amp; swayed the world by their love to him, <a id="l2210"></a>so that no Prince could be farther from deserving the name <a id="l2211"></a>of a persecutor. Ammianus indeed objects that he took off <a id="l2212"></a>his Vnkles, &amp; prosecuted his victory over Magnentius too <a id="l2213"></a>far: but he did the first because they poisoned his father <a id="l2214"></a>&amp; the last to secure not himself but Christianity from <a id="l2215"></a>the attempts of the heathens. And these objections being <a id="l2216"></a>removed, the character which Ammianus gives of  <a id="l2217"></a>him is great; &amp; agrees with that of Hilary Libanius &amp; <a id="l2218"></a>Gregory Nazianzen. And if these four witnesses suffice not, <a id="l2219"></a>let me add a fift. ffor <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n59-ref">[59]</sup> Epiphanius saith that he was mer<a id="l2220"></a>ciful &amp; good &amp; pious in all respects as the son of the <a id="l2221"></a>great &amp; perfect &amp; pious Constantine, this one thing excepted <a id="l2222"></a>that by the influence of his bishops he erred in the faith. All <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p031r"> &lt;31r&gt; </span> these witnesses lived in the reign of this Emperor <a id="l2223"></a>&amp; therefore knew what they wrote, &amp; being his ene<a id="l2224"></a>mies would not favour him. ffor they wrote after <a id="l2225"></a>his death, &amp; so were at liberty to speak their minds. <a id="l2226"></a>And therefore if any later Author affirms the contrary, he ought <a id="l2227"></a>to be corrected.</p>
