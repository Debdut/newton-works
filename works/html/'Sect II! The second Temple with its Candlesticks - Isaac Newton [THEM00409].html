<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Sect II <a id="l1"></a><br>The second Temple  with its <a id="l2"></a>Candlesticks representing the two Witnesses.</h2>
<p id="par1">When the Woman fled into the Wilderness she fled from the <a id="l3"></a>Temple on mount Sion through the Wilderness of Arabia to the <a id="l4"></a>great city Babylon &amp; by this flight changed her Metropolis. Her <a id="l5"></a>first Metropolis was the   seven <a id="l6"></a> cities of Asia represented by the seven Candlesticks:, her second was the great City seated on se<a id="l7"></a>ven mountains in the wilderness called the seven heads of the Beast. These mountains are literaly <a id="l8"></a>the seven hills on which Rome was seated: mystically they are <a id="l9"></a>seven  head cities highly exalted in dominion, the head cities <a id="l10"></a>of the seven kingdoms which remained after three of the first <a id="l11"></a>ten, horns of  Daniel's fourth Beast fell before the little <a id="l12"></a>horn. Mountains are put in second prophesy for cities, &amp; as the <a id="l13"></a>four heads of the Leopard signify the four kingdoms into which <a id="l14"></a>the Greek Empire  after the reign of Alexander <a id="l15"></a>the great became divided &amp; which are also represented by the four horns of the He-goat; so the seven heads of the Beast in being <a id="l16"></a>called Mountains are the reigning cities of the seven contemporary king<a id="l17"></a>doms   represented by the seven remaining horns of the Beast. From their first num<a id="l18"></a>ber they are called the  ten horns &amp; ten kings &amp; from their last <a id="l19"></a>the seven heads &amp; seven  mountains. The Woman in flying from the <a id="l20"></a>Temple on mount Sion, fled from the seven Candlesticks in that Temple <a id="l21"></a>which are the seven Churches of Asia &amp; ceased to be illuminated by <a id="l22"></a>their Lamps, &amp; became the seven Churches of the Cities represented <a id="l23"></a>by the seven mountains &amp; her people arriving at this new metropolis <a id="l24"></a>worshipped the king of Babylon &amp; his golden Image &amp; a new Temple <a id="l25"></a>is built for those of the captivity who separate from the Idolaters &amp; come out of great <a id="l26"></a>Babylon to worship the  God of Israel, the building of which <a id="l27"></a>Temple is thus described.</p>
<p id="par2"><em class="underline">Rise &amp; measure the Temple of God &amp; the Altar &amp; them that <a id="l28"></a>worship therein</em>  [that is their courts] <em class="underline">but the court which is without the Temple <a id="l29"></a>leave out &amp; measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles &amp; the holy <a id="l30"></a>city shall they tread under foot forty &amp; two months. And I will give power <a id="l31"></a>unto my two Witnesses &amp; they shall prophesy 1260 days cloathed in sack<a id="l32"></a>cloth. These are the two Olive trees &amp; the two Candlesticks standing before <a id="l33"></a>the God of the Earth.</em> All which is an allusion to Ezekiel's measuring the <a id="l34"></a>Temple in the time of the Babylonian captivity to signify that it should <a id="l35"></a>be rebuilt &amp; to Zerubbabel's building the second Temple with its  <a id="l36"></a>courts the court of the Temple,  &amp; Altar &amp; the court of <a id="l37"></a>them that worship therein called the Weomens court &amp; leaving unbuilt <a id="l38"></a>the outward Court which in Solomon's Temple had been the people's <a id="l39"></a>court &amp; during all the reign of the Persians which was 200 years <a id="l40"></a>continued unbuilt &amp; was given to the Gentiles, so that when the Greeks <a id="l41"></a>rebuilt it, it was called the Gentiles court. And it alludes also to the <a id="l42"></a>prophesying of Haggai &amp; Zechary at the building of the second Temple <a id="l43"></a>&amp; to the two Olive trees which in the prophesy of Zechary<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> empty them<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span>selves into the Candlestick of the Temple. Only instead of <a id="l44"></a>one Candlestick here are two to represent two Churches. For they <a id="l45"></a>are the two Witnesses &amp; these witnesses in being called two Candlesticks &amp; <a id="l46"></a>two Olive trees are two Churches. For Candlesticks  signify Churches <a id="l47"></a>(Apoc. 1. 20) &amp; so do Olive trees (Rom 11. 17, 24.) And these are the Churches <a id="l48"></a>of the  Western Roman Empire &amp; of the Empire of Germany as above. These Witnesses prophesy in the kingdom <a id="l52"></a>of the Beast because they are slain by him &amp; lye dead in the streets <a id="l53"></a>of the great City which for its spiritual fornication &amp; uncleanness is <a id="l54"></a>called Sodom &amp; for its oppression &amp; cruelty Ægypt &amp; for its bloodshed of the saints <a id="l55"></a>the  great city where or in whose dominion our Lord was crucified <a id="l56"></a>that is Rome.</p>
<p id="par3">Before the division of the Roman Empire the whole was <a id="l57"></a>represented by the Dragon, &amp; the Church of the whole by the <a id="l58"></a>twelve Tribes of Israel in the form of a Woman in the first <a id="l59"></a>Temple whose seven candlesticks with their lamps illuminating <a id="l60"></a>the whole Temple represent the seven Churches of Asia as <a id="l61"></a>the mother-churches from whence the light of the Gospel went <a id="l62"></a>forth into the Church Catholick of the primitive times during the long life of the Apostle Iohn &amp; the lives of his disciples. But when the <a id="l63"></a>Empire becomes divided into the Greek &amp; Latine Empires: that both <a id="l64"></a>Empires with their Churches fals &amp; true may be distinctly represented, <a id="l65"></a>a Beast with ten horns rises out of the sea, another Beast with <a id="l66"></a>two horns rises out of the earth &amp; a new Temple is built with <a id="l67"></a>two candlesticks. And henceforward the eastern Empire with its <a id="l68"></a>Churches false &amp; true are represented by the Dragon, the two<a id="l69"></a>horned Beast &amp; the 144000 worshipping in the first Temple; &amp; <a id="l70"></a>the Latine Empire with its Churches false &amp; true are re<a id="l71"></a>presented by the ten-horned Beast the Woman &amp; the two Witnesses <a id="l72"></a>worshipping in the second Temple. And in each Temple the <a id="l73"></a>people of God worship in the inner Court &amp; the Apostates in <a id="l74"></a>the Court without.</p>
<p id="par4">In the first Temple the 144000 worship in the inner Court <a id="l75"></a>standing with the Lamb on mount Sion before the throne &amp; before <a id="l76"></a>the Elders, as it were upon the sea of glass &amp; singing with harps <a id="l77"></a>at the sacrifices. And the people of the Dragon &amp; two horned Beast <a id="l78"></a>worship in the outward Court of this Temple being the seduced inha<a id="l79"></a>bitants of the earth &amp; sea to whom the Dragon came down when <a id="l80"></a>he was cast out of heaven that is out of the upper court, the court <a id="l81"></a>of the Temple &amp; Altar in which the throne of God is placed. <a id="l82"></a>When he was cast out of that Court he came down into the outward <a id="l83"></a>court, the court of the people, the Christian people called the inha<a id="l84"></a>bitants of the earth &amp; sea. By seducing these inhabitants he made <a id="l85"></a>the Woman fly into a spiritually barren Wilderness in the Latin Em<a id="l86"></a>pire &amp; the two horned Beast rise out of the Earth  in the Greek Em<a id="l87"></a>pire; &amp; then by the instigation of that Beast he made war upon the <a id="l88"></a>remnant of the twelve Tribes of Israel in the Greek Empire called the <a id="l89"></a>remnant of the womans seed, untill all were either killed or had re<a id="l90"></a>ceived the mark or name of the other Beast, except the 144000, who being sealed <a id="l91"></a> out of the twelve tribes of Israel with the seale or name <a id="l92"></a>of God in their foreheads, &amp; being interdicted buying &amp; selling among the inha<a id="l93"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span>bitants of the earth &amp; sea, retired from them into the inner <a id="l94"></a>Court.</p>
<p id="par5">In like manner the two Churches called the Witnesses worship <a id="l95"></a>in the inner court of the second Temple, &amp; the people of the <a id="l96"></a>ten-horned Beast &amp; Woman worship in the outward court thereof as is <a id="l97"></a>plainly exprest by saying, <em class="underline">Measure the temple &amp; altar &amp; them that <a id="l98"></a>worship therein but the court which is without the Temple leave out &amp; <a id="l99"></a>measure it not for it is given to the Gentiles.</em> </p>
<p id="par6">The two Temples are sufficiently distinguished from one another by <a id="l118"></a>the different number of their candlesticks &amp; different characters of their <a id="l119"></a>worshippers: but the worship is alike in them both. For the Beast &amp; <a id="l120"></a>his Image are worshipped &amp; his mark received by all the world, the fals <a id="l121"></a>Prophet &amp; Dragon setting up that worship in the outward court of the <a id="l122"></a>first Temple: &amp; therefore the worship in the outward courts of both <a id="l123"></a>Temples is alike. And the worship in the inner courts of both Temples <a id="l124"></a>is also alike, the worshippers being of one &amp; the same religion &amp; members <a id="l125"></a>of one &amp; the same mystical body of Christ. As those in the second <a id="l126"></a>Temple are called Witnesses &amp; Prophets so those in the first Temple are <a id="l127"></a>also Witnesses &amp; Prophets. For they have the testimony of Iesus (Apoc. 12. <a id="l128"></a>17) &amp; are mystically killed for not worshipping the Image of the Beast <a id="l129"></a>(ch. 13. 15) &amp; in respect of the great harvest of martyrs (ch. 14. 15) <a id="l130"></a>are called the first fruits unto God (v. 4) &amp; therefore they are martyrs <a id="l131"></a>or witnesses. And they sing a new song with harps &amp; in that respect <a id="l132"></a>are Prophets. For singing with musical instruments is prophesying (1 Chron. <a id="l133"></a>25. 1, 2, 3. 2 King. 3. 15. 1 Sam. 10. 5.) And in their mouth was found no <a id="l134"></a>lye (Apoc. 14. 5) &amp; therefore they are true Witnesses &amp; true Prophets. And <a id="l135"></a>as these Prophesy in the inner court of the first Temple by singing with <a id="l136"></a>harps at the sacrifices offered in that Temple so it is to be con<a id="l137"></a>ceived that the two Witnesses prophesy in the inner court of the second <a id="l138"></a>Temple by singing with harps at the sacrifices offered in this <a id="l139"></a>Temple. For they have power to smite the earth with all <a id="l140"></a>plagues as often as they will, that is, with the plagues of the se<a id="l141"></a>ven wars represented by the sacrifices at which the seven trumpets <a id="l142"></a>sound. They consume their enemies with fire in the first war <a id="l143"></a>&amp; turn the waters unto blood in the second, &amp; therefore prophesy <a id="l144"></a>all the time of those sacrifices. They are one of the two leggs of the son <a id="l145"></a>of Man who in the form of an Angel stands with his right foot on <a id="l146"></a>the sea &amp; his left foot on the earth as was said above. They are part of <a id="l147"></a>his mystical body &amp; of the cloud with which he is cloathed, &amp; their voice <a id="l148"></a>is the voice of that cloud uttering the seven thunders, which thunders, as <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span>  was explained above are the  thundering voices <a id="l149"></a>of the Levites singing with harps &amp; other musical instruments at <a id="l150"></a>the seven sacrifices while the Priests sound the Trumpets alternately <a id="l151"></a>three times at every sacrifice &amp; pour out the drink-offerings called the seven vials of wrath. <a id="l152"></a>And in respect of the seven stars in the right hand of the son of <a id="l153"></a>man, the 144000 may be also comprehended in his mystical body &amp; <a id="l154"></a>in the cloud with which he is cloathed &amp; be one of his leggs, &amp; their voice of singing at the <a id="l155"></a>like sacrifices, may be also comprehended in the voices of the seven <a id="l156"></a>thunders. So then the worship in both Temples is one &amp; the same <a id="l157"></a>in form, &amp; has one &amp; the same signification.</p>
<p id="par7">But tho the two Witnesses prophesy during all the seven <a id="l158"></a>sacrifices, yet it is not to be conceived that they prophesy all this <a id="l159"></a>time in sackcloth. When the idolatry of the Wilderness called <a id="l160"></a>by Daniel the Abomination of desolation is  completely <a id="l161"></a>set up then the two Witnesses put on sackcloth. When the <a id="l162"></a>worshipping of Images of gold &amp; silver &amp; brass &amp; wood &amp; stone <a id="l163"></a>which can neither see nor hear nor walk is completely <a id="l164"></a>set up &amp; established, then the Gentiles to whom the outward <a id="l165"></a>court is given, begin to be Gentiles properly so called. And from <a id="l166"></a>that time the Gentiles tread under foot the holy City 42 months; <a id="l167"></a>from that time the Witnesses prophesy in sackcloth 1260 days; <a id="l168"></a>from that time the Woman is fed &amp; nourished by the merchants <a id="l169"></a>of the earth in her place of honour in the Wilderness, and <a id="l170"></a>fares deliciously a time times &amp; half a time &amp;  <a id="l171"></a>1260 days; from that time the ten kings have one mind &amp; agree <a id="l172"></a>&amp; give their kingdom to the Beast, &amp; the Beast acts 42 months <a id="l173"></a>with the Woman upon his back, which dominion &amp; dignity is her <a id="l174"></a>place where she is fed; from that time the little horn of <a id="l175"></a>Daniels fourth Beast, having rooted up three of the ten horns <a id="l176"></a>which hindred his rise, &amp; brought all the rest to submission, has <a id="l177"></a>times &amp; laws given into his hand untill a time times &amp; half <a id="l178"></a>a time. At first the ten kings are of different religions <a id="l179"></a>both from the Woman &amp; from one another, whereby the <a id="l180"></a>two Witnesses have liberty of conscience for a time.

Let him that hath understanding count the number</em> <a id="l209"></a>[of the name] <em class="underline">of the Beast: for it is the number</em> [of the name] <em class="underline">of a man: <a id="l210"></a>&amp; his number is  666.</em> It was customary <a id="l211"></a>among the heathens to mark soldiers with the name or symbol of their kings <a id="l212"></a>or Commanders, servants with the  name or symbol of their masters, &amp; the <a id="l213"></a>worshipping of the heathen Gods with the name or symbol of the God whom they worshipped <a id="l214"></a>or with the name abbreviated or couched under the number made up of <a id="l215"></a>the numeral letters. And these marks were made in the forehead or neck or <a id="l216"></a>breast or hand or arm sometimes by burning sometimes by making coloured <a id="l217"></a>punctures in the flesh &amp; sometimes only by staining the flesh with  a colour. <a id="l218"></a>And in opposition to this custome Moses commanded the  Israelites that <a id="l219"></a>they should not  print any mark upon themselves Levit. 19.28. <a id="l220"></a>so that the custome was very ancient.  Such a mark was the figure of <a id="l221"></a>an ivy leaf imprest upon the worshippers of Bacchus &amp; such another mark <a id="l222"></a>is the signe of the cross when used in a superstitious manner  in nomine <a id="l223"></a>✝ Patris &amp; ✝ Filij &amp; ✝ spiritus sancti  to scare away the Devil or to <a id="l224"></a>cure diseases or to  sanctify a man or fortify him against harm.

To express the distinction made <a id="l231"></a>at this  time between the servants of God &amp; the worshippers <a id="l232"></a>of the Beast, the one are said to be sealed  with the seal of God the other <a id="l233"></a>marked with the  mark or name or number of the Beast. ||  Now as soon as <a id="l234"></a>this  sealing &amp; marking was finished  &amp; the seven Angels with the <a id="l235"></a>Trumpets were ready to sound <em class="underline">Iohn looked &amp; lo a Lamb stood on the mount <a id="l236"></a>Sion  &amp; with him an hundred  forty &amp; four thousand having his <a id="l237"></a>name &amp; his fathers name written in their foreheads.</em> These are the remnant of the Womans seed whom the Dragon went to persecute. These are the 144000 <a id="l238"></a>who were sealed  in their foreheads out of  the 12 tribes of Israel with the seale of God, <a id="l239"></a>which seal is here explained to be the name of the Lamb &amp; the name of <a id="l240"></a>his father. They are therefore the  Church of Christ  during <a id="l241"></a>the sounding of the Trumpets, &amp; the objects of their worship are  <a id="l242"></a> the Lamb  and his father. Some  Greek copies of the Apocalyps omit <em class="underline">the Lamb</em> but other <a id="l243"></a>very old ones have it, &amp; that very truly.
