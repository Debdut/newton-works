<p id="par1" class="i0">several captains of the Greeks in that war being sons of the <a id="l1"></a>Argonauts. And the ancient Greeks recconed Memnon or Amenophis <a id="l2"></a>king of Egypt, to have reigned in the times of that war, feigning <a id="l3"></a>him to be the son of Tithonus the elder brother of Priam, &amp; in the <a id="l4"></a>end of that war to have come from Susa to Priam's assistance. Amenophis was <a id="l5"></a>therefore of the same age with the elder children of Priam. In the <a id="l6"></a>opinion of the ancient Greeks he was with his army at Susa in the <a id="l7"></a>last year of the Trojan war; &amp; after that he might return into Egypt <a id="l8"></a>&amp; adorn it with buildings &amp; Obelisks &amp; Statues, &amp; dye there about <a id="l9"></a>90 or 95 years after the death of Solomon when he had determined <a id="l10"></a>&amp; settled the beginning of the new Egyptian year of 365 days upon <a id="l11"></a>the Vernal Equinox so as to deserve the monument above mentioned <a id="l12"></a>in memory thereof.</p>
<p id="par2">Thus by the consent of two arguments founded upon Astronomy, the one taken <a id="l13"></a>from the  Precession of the Equinox, the other from <a id="l14"></a>the Æra of the Theban year of the Egyptians, it appears that the <a id="l15"></a>Argonautic Expedition was about 40 or 45 years later then the <a id="l16"></a>death of Solomon &amp; the last year of the Trojan war about 75 years later then his <a id="l17"></a>death, &amp; the death of Amenophis or Memnon, according to the date of <a id="l18"></a>his sepulchral monument about 90 or 95 years later then Solomon's. And <a id="l19"></a>the truth of these things will be further confirmed when it shall ap<a id="l20"></a>pear that Sesostris was Sesac &amp; invaded the nations one generati<a id="l21"></a>on before the Argonautic Expedition. Now these recconings differing <a id="l22"></a>from the Chronology of the Greeks, give us  occasion to enquire <a id="l23"></a>into the reason of the difference.</p>
<p id="par3">The Europeans had no Chronology before the times of the Persian <a id="l24"></a>Monarchy. And what ever chronology they have of ancienter times has <a id="l25"></a>been framed since by reasoning &amp; conjecture. In the beginning of that <a id="l26"></a>Monarchy Acusilaus made Phoroneus as old as  Ogyges &amp; <a id="l27"></a> his flood &amp; both of them 1020 years older then the Olympiads: which is above 680 <a id="l28"></a>years older then the truth. And to make out this recconing his follow<a id="l29"></a>ers have increased the reigns of kings in length &amp; number. Plutarch <a id="l30"></a>tells<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> us that the Philosophers anciently delivered their opinions in verse <a id="l32"></a>as Orpheus, Hesiod, Parmenides, Xenophanes, Empedocles, Thales, but <a id="l33"></a>afterwards left off the use of verses, &amp; that Aristarchus, Timocharis, <a id="l34"></a>Aristillus, Hipparchus, did not make Astronomy the more contemptible by describing it in prose after Eudoxus Hesiod &amp; Thales had wrote of it in verse. <a id="l35"></a> Solon wrote<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> in verse, &amp; all the seven wise men were addicted to Poetry as <a id="l36"></a>Anaximenes <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> affirmed. Till those days the Greeks wrote only in verse, &amp; <a id="l38"></a>while they did so there could be no Chronology, nor any other History then <a id="l39"></a>such as was mixed with poetical fancies. Pliny <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> in recconing up the inven<a id="l41"></a>tors of things tells us that Pherecides Syrius taught to compose discourses <a id="l42"></a>in prose in the reign of Cyrus, &amp; Cadmus Milesius to write history. And <a id="l43"></a>in <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> another place he saith that Cadmus Milesius was the first that wrote in prose. Iosephus <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> tells us that Cadmus Milesius &amp; Acusilaus were <a id="l45"></a>but a little before the Expedition of the Persians against the Greeks. <a id="l46"></a>And Suidas <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> calls Acusilaus a most ancient historian, &amp; saith that he <a id="l47"></a>wrote Genealogies out of Tables of brass which his father, as was reported, <a id="l48"></a>found in a corner of his house. Who hid them there may be doubted. <a id="l49"></a>For the Greeks <sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> had no publick table or inscription older then the laws <a id="l51"></a>of Draco  Pherecides Atheniensis in the reign of <a id="l52"></a>Darius Hystaspis or soon after, wrote of the antiquities &amp; ancient <a id="l53"></a>genealogies of the Athenians in ten books &amp; was one of the first <a id="l54"></a>European writers of this kind, &amp; one of the best: whence he had <a id="l55"></a>the name of Genealogus, &amp; by Dionysius <sup>i</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> Halicarnassensis is said to <a id="l56"></a>be second to none of the Genealogers. Epimenides, not the Philosopher <a id="l57"></a>but an Historian, wrote also of the ancient genealogies. And Hellanicus <a id="l58"></a>who was twelve years older then Herodotus, digested his history by the <a id="l59"></a>ages (or successions) of the Priestesses of Iuno Argiva. Others digested <a id="l60"></a>theirs by those of the Archons of Athens, or kings of the Lacedemo<a id="l61"></a>nians. Hippias the Elean published a breviary of the Olympiads supported <a id="l62"></a>by no certain arguments as Plutarch <sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> tells us. He lived in the 105<sup>th</sup> <a id="l63"></a>Olympiad &amp; was derided by Plato for his ignorance. This Breviary <a id="l64"></a>seems to have conteined nothing more then a short account of the <a id="l65"></a>Victors in every Olympiad. Then Ephorus <sup>l</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> the disciple of Isocrates formed <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> a chronological history of Greece beginning with the return of the <a id="l67"></a>Heraclides into Peloponnesus &amp; ending with the siege of Perinthus in the <a id="l68"></a>twentieth year of Philip the father of Alexander the great, that is, eleven <a id="l69"></a>years before the fall of the Persian Empire. But he digested things<sup>m</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> by <a id="l70"></a>generations; &amp; the recconing by the Olympiads or by any other Æra was not <a id="l71"></a>yet in use. The Arundelian Marbles were composed sixty years after the <a id="l72"></a>death of Alexander the great (An 4. Olymp. 128) &amp; yet mention not the Olympiads <a id="l73"></a>nor any other  standing Æra but reccon backwards from the time then present. <a id="l74"></a>But Chronology was now reduced to a recconing by years. And in the next Olympiad <a id="l75"></a>Timæus Siculus improved it. For he wrote a history in several books down to <a id="l76"></a>his own times according to the Olympiads, comparing the Ephori, the kings <a id="l77"></a>of Sparta, the Archons of Athens &amp; the Priestesses of Argos with the <a id="l78"></a>Olympic victors, so as to make the Olympiads &amp; the Genealogies &amp; suc<a id="l79"></a>cessions of kings &amp; Priestesses &amp; Poetical histories suit with one another <a id="l80"></a>according to the best of his judgement: &amp; where he left off Polybius <a id="l81"></a>began &amp; carried on the history. Evatosthenes wrote above an hundred <a id="l82"></a>years after the death of Alexander the great. He was followed by <a id="l83"></a>Apollodorus &amp; these two have been followed ever since by Chronologers.</p>
<p id="par4">But how uncertain their Chronology is, &amp; how doubtful it was <a id="l84"></a>reputed by the Greeks of those times may be understood by these passages of Plutarch. <em class="underline">Some reccon Lycurgus</em>, saith<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> he, <em class="underline">contemporary <a id="l86"></a>to Iphitus, &amp; to have been his companion in ordering the Olympic <a id="l87"></a>festivals, amongst whom was Aristotel the Philosopher: arguing <a id="l88"></a>from the Olympic Disk which had the name of Lycurgus upon it. <a id="l89"></a>Others supputing the times by the succession of the kings of Lace<a id="l90"></a>dæmon, as Eratosthenes &amp; Apollodorus, affirm that he was not a <a id="l91"></a>few years older then the first Olympiad</em>. He began to flourish <a id="l92"></a>in the 17<sup>th</sup> or 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad &amp; at length Aristotel &amp; some <a id="l93"></a>others made him as old as the first Olympiad, &amp; then Eratosthe<a id="l94"></a>nes Apollodorus &amp; their followers made him above an hundred <a id="l95"></a>years older. And in another place <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> Plutarch tells us: <em class="underline">The con<a id="l96"></a>gress of Solon with Crœsus some think they can confute by <a id="l97"></a>Chronology. But a history so illustrious, &amp; verified by so many <a id="l98"></a>witnesses, &amp; which is more, so agreeable to the manners of So<a id="l99"></a>lon &amp; worthy of  the greatness of his mind &amp; of his <a id="l100"></a>wisdom, I cannot perswade my self to reject because of some <a id="l101"></a>chronological Canons, as they call them, which hundreds of <a id="l102"></a>authors correcting have not yet been able to constitute any <a id="l103"></a>thing certain, in which they could agree amongst themselves <a id="l104"></a>about repugnances</em>.</p>
<p id="par5">And as for the Chronology of the Latines that is still <a id="l105"></a>more uncertain. Plutarch<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> represents great uncertainties <a id="l107"></a>in the originals of Rome, &amp; so doth <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup> Servius. The old Records <a id="l109"></a>of the Latines were <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup> burnt by the Gauls 120 years after the <a id="l110"></a>Regifuge &amp; 64 years before the death of Alexander the great. <a id="l111"></a>And Quintus Fabius Pictor <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup> the oldest historian of the Latines lived <a id="l113"></a> an hundred years later then that king &amp; took almost all things from Diocles Peparæthius a Greek. ✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 1v &gt; </span><sup>✝</sup> And <a id="l114"></a>✝ And the chronologies of Gallia, Spain, Germany, Scythia, Suedeland, <a id="l115"></a>Britain &amp; Ireland, are of a date still later. For Scythia beyond <a id="l116"></a>the Danube had no letters till Vlphilas their Bishop formed them <a id="l117"></a>which was above 650 years after the death of Alexander the great.  And <a id="l118"></a>Germany had none till it received them from the western <a id="l119"></a>Empire of the Latines above 700 years after the death of that <a id="l120"></a>king. The Hunns had none in the days of Procopius who flourished 850 years after the death of that king. And Sweden &amp; Norway  received them  still later <a id="l121"></a>And things said to be done above an hundred &amp; twenty years before the use <a id="l122"></a>of Letters, are of little credit.</p>

<p id="par7">Diodorus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup> in the beginning of his history tells us that he did not define <a id="l126"></a>by any certain space, the times preceding the the Trojan war because he <a id="l127"></a>had no certain foundation to rely upon: but from the Trojan war <a id="l128"></a>according to the recconing of Apollodorus Atheniensis whom he <a id="l129"></a>followed there were eighty years to the return of the Heraclides <a id="l130"></a>into Peloponnesus; &amp;  from that period to the first Olympiad there <a id="l131"></a>were three hundred &amp; twenty  eight years, computing the times from <a id="l132"></a>the kings of the Lacedemonians. Apollodorus followed Eratosthenes &amp; both of them followed Thucydides &amp; perhaps he followed Acusilaus in rec<a id="l133"></a>coning eighty years from the Trojan war.   <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 2v &gt; </span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 2r resumes &gt; </span> But in recconing 328 years <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> from that return to the first Olympiad, the Chronologers only <a id="l140"></a>computed the times by the successions of the kings of Lacedemon <a id="l141"></a>as Plutarch<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup> also affirms; &amp; therein they have been ever since <a id="l143"></a>followed by later Chronologers. And since this recconing was gathered <a id="l144"></a>by computing the times from the Kings of the Lacedemonians, <a id="l145"></a>that is, from their number, let us reexamin that computation</p>
<p id="par8">All nations before they began to keep exact accounts <a id="l146"></a>of time, have been prone to raise their antiquities; &amp; this humour <a id="l147"></a>has been promoted by the contention between nations about the <a id="l148"></a>antiquity of their originals. <span class="ns">☉</span> Herodotus tells us <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 3v &gt; </span><span class="ns">☉</span> Herodotus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> tells us that the Egyptians &amp; their Priests recconed from <a id="l149"></a>the reign of Menes to that of Sethon who put Sennacherib to <a id="l150"></a>flight, three hundred forty &amp; one generations of men, &amp; as many <a id="l151"></a>Priests of Vulcan, &amp; as many kings of Egypt: &amp; that three hun<a id="l152"></a>dred generations make ten thousand years, (for, saith he, three <a id="l153"></a>generations of men make an hundred years;) &amp; the remaining <a id="l154"></a>forty &amp; one generations make 1340 years (he should have <a id="l155"></a>said 1366)  And so the whole time from the reign of Moses <a id="l156"></a>to that of Sethon was 11340 years. And by this way of <a id="l157"></a>recconing, &amp; allotting long reigns to the Gods of Egypt, Hero<a id="l158"></a>dotus tells us from the Priests of Egypt, that from Pan to Amosis <a id="l159"></a>were 15000 years, &amp; from Hercules to Amosis 17000 years.</p>
<p id="par9">The Greeks &amp; Latines have been more modest in this point<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 3r resumes &gt; </span> The Greeks &amp; Latines have been <a id="l160"></a>more modest in this point then the Egyptians &amp; Persians &amp; some <a id="l161"></a>other nations, but yet have exceeded the truth. For in stating <a id="l162"></a>the times by the reigns of such kings as were ancienter then the <a id="l163"></a>Persian Monarchy they have also put their reigns equipollent to <a id="l164"></a>generations, &amp; accordingly made them one with another an age <a id="l165"></a>a piece, recconing three ages to an hundred years. For they make <a id="l166"></a>the seven kings of Rome who preceded the Consuls to have reigned <a id="l167"></a>244 years, which is one which another 35 years a piece. And the <a id="l168"></a>14 kings of the Latines between Æneas &amp; Numitor, or between <a id="l169"></a>the founding of Lavinium &amp; Rome to have reigned 425 years <a id="l170"></a>which is above 30 years a piece. And the first ten kings of <a id="l171"></a>Macedon (Cavanus &amp;c) to have reigned 353 years which is above <a id="l172"></a>35 years a piece. And the first ten kings of Athens (Cecrops <a id="l173"></a>&amp;c) 351 years, which is 35 years a piece. And the first eight <a id="l174"></a>kings of Argos (Inachus, Phoroneus &amp;c) to have reigned 371 <a id="l175"></a>years, which is above 46 years a piece. And between the <a id="l176"></a>return of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus &amp; the end of the <a id="l177"></a>first Messenian war, the ten kings of Sparta in one race(Euristhe<a id="l178"></a>nes, Agis, Echestratus, Labotas, Doriagus, Agesilaus, Archelaus, <a id="l179"></a>Telechus, Alcamenes &amp; Polydorus,) the nine of the other race <a id="l180"></a>(Procles, Sous, Euripon, Prytanis, Eunomus, Polydectes, Charilaus, <a id="l181"></a>Nicander, Theopompus,) the ten kings of Messene (Cresphontes, <a id="l182"></a>Epytus, Glaucus, Istmius, Dotadas, Sibotas, Phintas, Antiochus, <a id="l183"></a>Euphaes, Aristodemus,) &amp; the nine of Arcadia (Cypsalus,  <a id="l184"></a>Olæas, Buchalion, Phialus, Simus, Pompus, Ægineta, Polymnestor, <a id="l185"></a>Æchmis,) by their recconing look up 379 years; which is 38 years a piece to the ten <a id="l186"></a>kings &amp; 42 years a piece to the nine. And the five kings of <a id="l187"></a>Sparta  of the race of Eurysthenes between the end <a id="l188"></a>of the first Messenian war &amp; the beginning of the reign of <a id="l189"></a>Darius Hystaspis (Eurycrates, Anaxander, Eurycrates II, Leon, <a id="l190"></a>Anaxandrides) reigned 202 years, which is above 40 years a <a id="l191"></a>piece</p>
<p id="par10">Thus the Greek Chronologers who followed Timæus &amp; Eratosthenes <a id="l192"></a>have made the kings of their several cities who lived before the <a id="l193"></a>times of the Persian Empire to reign about 35 or 40 years a piece <a id="l194"></a>one with another, which is a length so much beyond the course of <a id="l195"></a>nature as is not to be credited. For by the ordinary course of nature <a id="l196"></a>kings reigne one with another about eighteen or twenty years <a id="l197"></a>a piece. And if in some instances they reign (one with another) five or six years <a id="l198"></a>longer, in others they reign as much shorter. Eighteen or twenty <a id="l199"></a>years is a medium. So the 18 Kings of Iudah who succeeded Solo<a id="l200"></a>mon, reigned 390 years, whichis one with another 22 years a piece. <a id="l201"></a>The 15 Kings of Israel after Solomon, reigned 259 years, which <a id="l202"></a>is 17<span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1" style="width: 0.712em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.709em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.353em, 1000.71em, 3.051em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-3"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.474em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.3em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -4.426em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-4" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">1</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.323em, 1000.33em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -3.585em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-5" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">4</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1000.47em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 0.474em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.46em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.397em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-1"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></script> years  a piece.

And <a id="l218"></a>the reigns of kings are still shorter because kings are succeeded <a id="l219"></a> not only by their eldest sons, but sometimes by their brothers, <a id="l220"></a>&amp; sometimes they are slain or deposed &amp; succeeded by others of an equal or <a id="l221"></a>greater age, especially in elective or turbulent kingdoms. But <a id="l222"></a>Timæus &amp; his followers have taken the reign of kings for gene<a id="l223"></a>rations &amp; recconed three generations to an hundred &amp; sometimes <a id="l224"></a>to an hundred &amp; twenty years &amp; founded the technical chronology <a id="l225"></a>of the Greeks upon this way of recconing. Let the recconing be reduced to the course of nature  by putting the reigns of kings one <a id="l226"></a>with another at about 18 or 20 years a piece: &amp; the ten kings <a id="l227"></a>of Messene &amp; the nine of Arcadia above mentioned between the <a id="l228"></a>return of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus &amp; the end of the first <a id="l229"></a>Messenian war, will scarce take up above 180 or 200 years.</p>
<p id="par11">Euryleon the son of Ægeus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> commanded the main body of <a id="l233"></a>the Messenians in the fift year of the first Messenian war, <a id="l234"></a>&amp; was in the fift generation from Oiolycus the  son of <a id="l235"></a>Theras the brother in law of Aristodemus, &amp; tutor to his sons <a id="l236"></a>Eurysthenes &amp; Procles, as Pausanias relates. And by consequence, <a id="l237"></a>from the return of the Heraclides, which was in the days of Theras, <a id="l238"></a>to the battel in the fift year of this war; there were six generations; which (as I conceive) being for the most part by <a id="l239"></a>the eldest sons, will scarce exceed 30 years to a generation, <a id="l240"></a>&amp; so may amount to about 170 or 180 years. That war <a id="l241"></a>lasted 19 or 20 years. Add the last 15 years &amp; there will <a id="l242"></a>be about 190  years to the end of that war: where<a id="l243"></a>as the followers of Timæus make it about 380 years.</p>
<p id="par12">In the race of the Spartan kings descended from Eu<a id="l244"></a>rysthenes, after Polydorus reigned these kings, Eurycrates I, <a id="l245"></a>Alexander, Eurycrates II, Leon, Anaxandrides, Cleomenes, <a id="l246"></a>Leonidas &amp;c. &amp; in the other race, after Theopompus, reigned <a id="l247"></a>Zeuxidamus, Anaxidamus, Archidamus, Agasicles, Ariston, <a id="l248"></a>Demaratus, Leotycides &amp;c according to Pausanias, or Anaxan<a id="l249"></a>drides, Archidemus, Anaxileus, Leutychides, Hippocratides, Ariston, <a id="l250"></a>Demaratus, Leutychides II according to Herodotus. Leonidas was <a id="l251"></a>slain at Thermopylæ in the sixt year of Xerxes, &amp; Leuty<a id="l252"></a>chides was then alive: so that in one race there were <a id="l253"></a>seven kings between the end of the  first Messenian war &amp; <a id="l254"></a>the sixt year of Xerxes, &amp; in the other race there were <a id="l255"></a>between six &amp; seven kings according to Pausanias, or between <a id="l256"></a>seven &amp; eight according to Herodotus, or at a medium, seven <a id="l257"></a>kings in both races. And their reigns at twenty years a <a id="l258"></a>piece one with another, amount to 140 years; that is 90 <a id="l259"></a>years to the death of Cyrrus, &amp; 50 years more to the invasion <a id="l260"></a>of Greece by Xerxes. Anaxandrides &amp; Ariston, the last of <a id="l261"></a>those seven kings of Sparta but two, were<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup> contemporary <a id="l262"></a>to Crœsus. And Crœsus began his reign about 28 years <a id="l263"></a>before the death of Cyrus. Count backwards 80 years more <a id="l264"></a>for the four preceding reigns of the kings of Sparta unto the <a id="l265"></a>end of the first Messenian war, &amp; 190 years more unto the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> return of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus: &amp; this return <a id="l266"></a>will be about 298 years before the death of Cyrus. Subduct <a id="l267"></a>the years of the Olympiads, &amp; there will remain about 51 <a id="l268"></a>years between the return of the Heraclides &amp; the first Olym<a id="l269"></a>piad. But the followers of Timæus place the return of the <a id="l270"></a>Heraclides about 275 years earlier. And this is the funda<a id="l271"></a>mental error of the artificial chronology of the Greeks.</p>
<p id="par13">The kingdom of Macedon<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup> was founded by  Caranus <a id="l272"></a>&amp; Perdiccas, who being of the race of Temenus king of Argos, fled <a id="l273"></a>from Argos in the reign of Phidon the brother of Caranus. Temenus <a id="l274"></a>entred Peloponnesus with the Heraclides as above. And after him &amp; <a id="l275"></a>his son Cisus, the kingdom of Argos became divided  among the posterity <a id="l276"></a>of Temenus untill Phidon reunited it, expelling his own kindred. <a id="l277"></a>He grew potent, appointed weights &amp; measures in Peloponnesus, &amp; coyned <a id="l278"></a>silver moneys, &amp; removing the  Pisæans &amp; Eleans, presided <a id="l279"></a>in the Olympic games, but was soon after subdued by the Eleans <a id="l280"></a>&amp; Spartans. Herodotus<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup> reccons that Perdiccas was the first king of <a id="l281"></a>Macedon. Later writers, as Livy, Pausanias, &amp; Suidas, make <a id="l282"></a>Caranus the first king. Iustin calls Perdiccas the successor <a id="l283"></a>of Caranus, &amp; Solinus saith that Perdiccas succeeded Caranus &amp; was the first that obteined the name of king. <a id="l284"></a>Its probable that Caranus &amp; Perdiccas were contemporaries <a id="l285"></a>&amp; fled at the same time from Phidon, &amp; at first erected small <a id="l286"></a>Principalities which after the death of Caranus became <a id="l287"></a>one under Perdiccas. Herodotus<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n26-ref">[26]</sup> tells us that after Perdiccas <a id="l288"></a>reigned Aræus (or Argæus,) Philip, Aeropus, Alcetes, Amyntas, <a id="l289"></a>&amp; Alexander successively. Alexander was contemporary to <a id="l290"></a>Xerxes king of Persia, &amp; died An. 4 Olymp. 79, &amp; was succeeded <a id="l291"></a>by Perdiccas II. And Thucydides<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n27-ref">[27]</sup> tells us that there were eight <a id="l293"></a>kings of Macedon before Archelaus the son of Perdiccas. Now <a id="l294"></a>by recconing above 40 years a piece to these kings, Chronologers <a id="l295"></a>have made Caranus older then the Olympiads: whereas if we <a id="l296"></a>should reccon their reigns at about 18 or 20 years a piece <a id="l297"></a>the first seven reigns counted backwards from the death of <a id="l298"></a>Alexander, will place the beginning of the kingdom of Ma<a id="l299"></a>cedon under Perdiccas &amp; Caranus upon the 46<sup>th</sup> Olympiad or <a id="l300"></a>thereabouts. It could not be older because Leocides the son of <a id="l301"></a>Phidon, &amp; Megacles the son of Alcmæon at one &amp; the same time <a id="l302"></a>courted Agarista the daughter of Clisthenes king of Licyon (as<sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n28-ref">[28]</sup> Hero<a id="l303"></a>dotus tells us,) &amp; the Amphictyons by the advice of Solon made  Alcmæon &amp; Clisthenes, &amp; Eurolycus king of Thessaly, <a id="l305"></a>commanders of their army in their war against Cyrrha, &amp; the <a id="l306"></a>Cyrrhæans were conquered an 2 Olymp. 47 according to the Marbles. <a id="l307"></a>Phidon therefore &amp; his brother Caranus were contemporary to Alc<a id="l308"></a>mæon &amp; all of them to Clisthenes &amp; Solon &amp; flourished about the <a id="l309"></a>47<sup>th</sup> or 48<sup>th</sup> Olympiad.

<p id="par16">Iphitus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup> presided both in the Temple of Iupiter Olympus &amp; in the Olympic <a id="l358"></a>games; &amp; so did his successors till the 26<sup>th</sup> Olympiad: &amp; so long the Victors <a id="l359"></a>were rewarded with a Tripus. But then the Pisæans getting above <a id="l360"></a>the Eleans, began to preside &amp; rewarded the Victors with a crown, &amp; <a id="l361"></a>instituted the Carnea to Apollo, &amp; continued to preside till Phidon inter<a id="l362"></a>rupted them, that is, till about the time of the 48<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. For<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup> in the <a id="l363"></a>48<sup>th</sup> Olympiad the Eleans entred the country of the Pisæans, suspecting <a id="l364"></a>their designes, but were prevailed upon to return home quietly. Afterwards <a id="l365"></a>the Pisæans confederated with several other Greek nations, &amp; made war upon <a id="l366"></a>the Eleans, &amp; in the end were beaten. In this war I conceive it was <a id="l367"></a>that Phidon presided, suppose in the 49<sup>th</sup> Olympiad.

<p id="par17">Strabo<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup> tells us that Phidon was the tenth from Temenus; not the <a id="l380"></a>tenth king (for between Cisus &amp; (Phidon they reigned not,) but the tenth by <a id="l381"></a>generation from father to son including Temenus.

But chro<a id="l386"></a>nologers reccon about 515 years from the return of the Heraclides to <a id="l387"></a>the 48<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, &amp; account Phidon the seventh from Timenus: which <a id="l388"></a>is after the rate of 85 years to a generation, &amp; therefore not to be <a id="l389"></a>admitted.</p>
<p id="par18">The artificial chronologers have made Lycurgus the Legislator as <a id="l390"></a>old as Iphitus the restorer of the Olympiads, &amp; Iphitus above an hundred <a id="l391"></a>years older then the first Olympiad.

And beginning to flourish in the days of Lycurgus <a id="l411"></a>it is not likely that Lycurgus began to flourish much before the 18<sup>th</sup> <a id="l412"></a>Olympiad. The name of Lycurgus being on the Olympic Disk, Aristotel <a id="l413"></a>concluded thence that Lycurgus was the companion of Iphitus in restoring <a id="l414"></a>the Olympic games. And this argument might be the grownd of the <a id="l415"></a>opinion of Chronologers that Lycurgus &amp; Iphitus were contemporary. <a id="l416"></a>But Iphitus did not restore all the Olympic games. He<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n37-ref">[37]</sup> restored the racing <a id="l417"></a>in the first Olympiad, Coræbus being Victor. In the 14<sup>th</sup> Olympiad the <a id="l418"></a>double stadium was added, Hypænus being Victor. And in the 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad <a id="l419"></a>the Quinquertium &amp; Wrastling were restored, Lampus &amp; Eurybatus (two <a id="l420"></a>Spartans) being Victors. And the Disk was one of the games of the Quin<a id="l421"></a>quertium: And Pausanias<sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup> tells us that there were three Disks kept in <a id="l422"></a>the Olympic Treasury at Attis. These therefore having the name of <a id="l423"></a>Lycurgus upon them, shew that they were dedicated by him at the re<a id="l424"></a>storing of the Disk in the 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. Now Polydectes king of Sparta <a id="l425"></a>being slain before the birth of his son Charillus or Charilaus, left the <a id="l426"></a>kingdom to Lycurgus his brother, &amp; Lycurgus upon the birth of Charillus <a id="l427"></a>became Tutor to the child, &amp; some time after travelled into Crete &amp; <a id="l428"></a>Asia till the child grew up, &amp; brought back with him the Poem of Homer, <a id="l429"></a>&amp; soon after published his laws, suppose about the 22<sup>th</sup> or 24<sup>th</sup> Olympiad <a id="l430"></a>For he was growing old. Now Terpander was a Lyric Poet &amp; began <a id="l431"></a>to flourish about this time. For<sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n39-ref">[39]</sup> he imitated Orpheus &amp; Homer; &amp; sung <a id="l434"></a>Homers verses &amp; his own, &amp; wrote the Laws of Lycurgus in verse, &amp; <a id="l435"></a>was victor in the Pythic games in the 26<sup>t</sup> Olympiad as above. He <a id="l436"></a>was the first who distinguished the modes of Lyric Music by several names. And Ardalus &amp; Clo<a id="l437"></a>nas soon after did the like for wind Music. And from hence forward <a id="l438"></a>by the encouragement of the Pythic games now instituted, several eminent <a id="l439"></a>Musitians &amp; Poets flourished in Greece; as Archilochus, Eumelus Corinthius. <a id="l440"></a>Polymnestus, Thaletas, Xenodemus, Xenocritus, Sacadus, Tyrtæus, Tlesilla, <a id="l441"></a>Rhianus, Alcman, Arion, Stesichorus, Mimnermus, Alcæus, Sappho, Theognis, <a id="l442"></a>Anacreon, Simonides, Æschilus, Pindar, by whom the Music &amp; Poetry of the Greeks <a id="l443"></a>were brought to perfection.</p>
<p id="par19">Lycurgus published his laws in the reign of Agesilaus the son <a id="l444"></a>&amp; successor of Dorissus or Doriagus in the other race of the kings of Sparta. <a id="l445"></a>From the return of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus to the beginning of the reign of Agesilaus there were six reigns including that short <a id="l446"></a>one of Aristodemus the father of Eurysthenes &amp; Procles.

And from the <a id="l448"></a>same return to the beginning of the reign of Polydectes in the other <a id="l449"></a>race of the Spartan kings there were also six reigns, &amp; these reigns <a id="l450"></a>at twenty years a piece one with another amount to 120 years. <a id="l451"></a>Count those years backwards from the 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, &amp; the return <a id="l452"></a>of the Heraclides will be about 52 years before the first Olympiad <a id="l453"></a>as above.</p>
<p id="par20">Iphitus who restored the Olympic games,<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n41-ref">[41]</sup> was descended from <a id="l454"></a>Oxylus the son of Hæmon the son of Thoas the son of Andræmon. Hercules &amp; Andræmon married two sisters. Thoas warred at Troy. Ox<a id="l455"></a>ylus returned into Peloponnesus with the Heraclides. In this return <a id="l456"></a>he commanded a body of Ætolians &amp; recovered Elea,<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n42-ref">[42]</sup> from whence <a id="l459"></a>his ancestor Ætolus the son of Endymion  the son of <a id="l460"></a>Aëthlius had been driven by Salmoneus the grandson of Hellen. <a id="l461"></a>And <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n43-ref">[43]</sup> by the friendship of the Heraclides,  Oxylus had the care of the <a id="l462"></a>Olympic Temple committed to him: &amp; the Heraclides for his service <a id="l463"></a>done them, granted to him further upon oath that the country of <a id="l464"></a>the Eleans should be free from invasions, &amp; be defended by them from <a id="l465"></a>all armed force. And when the Eleans were thus consecrated Oxylus <a id="l466"></a>restored the Olympic games.

<p id="par21">Pausanias<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n46-ref">[46]</sup> represents that Malas the son of Antissus (of the <a id="l471"></a>posterity of Gonussa the daughter of Sicyon) was not above six <a id="l472"></a>generations older then Cypselus king of Corinth, &amp; that he was con<a id="l473"></a>temporary to Aletes who returned with the Heraclides into Peleponnesus, <a id="l474"></a>the reign of Cypselus began an. 2 Olymp. 31, &amp; six generations at 29 <a id="l475"></a>years to a generation, amount unto 174 years. Count those years <a id="l476"></a>backwards, &amp; they will place the return of the Heraclides into the Pelo<a id="l477"></a>ponnesus about 52 years before the first Olympiad where I placed <a id="l478"></a>it above. In this interval of time reigned nine kings of Corinth <a id="l479"></a>Aletes, Ixion, Agelas,  Prymnes, Bacchis, <a id="l480"></a>Agelas, Eudemus, Aristodemus, &amp; Telestes. And then reigned <a id="l481"></a>the Prytanes annually till the tyranny of Cypselus &amp; his son <a id="l482"></a>Periander. If to the nine reigns which preceded the annual <a id="l483"></a>Prytanes, &amp; the two which followed them be allowed about  18 <a id="l484"></a>years a piece one with another, they will take up about  <a id="l485"></a>198 years: which being subducted from the interval of 244 <a id="l486"></a>years between the return of the Heraclides &amp; the death of <a id="l487"></a>Periander an. 4 Olymp. 48, there will remain  46 years <a id="l488"></a>for the annual Prytanes.

<p id="par22">From the return of the Heraclides count 80  years backwards <a id="l492"></a>to the Trojan war, &amp; the destruction of Troy will be about 75 years <a id="l493"></a>after the death of Solomon, &amp; the Argonautic Expedition which was <a id="l494"></a>one generation earlier, will be about 43 years after it, as was de<a id="l495"></a>termined above by arguments taken from Astronomy.</p>
<p id="par23">And these recconings are confirmed by one or two arguments <a id="l496"></a>more.

And thus the seventeen inter<a id="l503"></a>valls by the fathers side &amp; eighteen by the mothers, will at <a id="l504"></a>a middle recconing amount unto about 507 years, which <a id="l505"></a>counted backwards from the beginning of the Peloponnesian <a id="l506"></a>war, at which time Hippocrates began to flourish, will <a id="l507"></a>reach up to the 43<sup>th</sup> year after the death of Solomon &amp; <a id="l508"></a>there place the Argonautic Expedition.</p>
<p id="par24">When the Romans conquered the Carthaginians the <a id="l509"></a>Archives of Carthage came into their hands.

And the first building of Triremes <a id="l559"></a>whereby Colonies might be sent abroad without danger of Pyrates, which <a id="l560"></a>till those days infested the Greek seas, might be ten or twenty years <a id="l561"></a>earlier. From the Colonies hence forward sent into Italy &amp; Sicily came <a id="l562"></a>the name of Græcia magna.</p>
<p id="par26">Thucydides<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n49-ref">[49]</sup> tells us further that the Greeks began to come into <a id="l563"></a>Sicily almost 300 years after the Siculi had invaded that island which an <a id="l564"></a>army out of Italy. And therefore that invasion was almost 631 years <a id="l565"></a>before the end of the Peloponnesian war, that is, almost as early as the <a id="l566"></a>27<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign. Whence it may be placed in the reign of <a id="l567"></a>Solomon. Hellanicus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n50-ref">[50]</sup> tells us that it was in the third generation <a id="l569"></a>before the Trojan war, &amp; in the 26<sup>th</sup> year of the Priesthood of <a id="l570"></a>Alcinoe Priestess of Iuno Argiva: &amp; Philistus of Syracuse that it was 80 years <a id="l571"></a>before the Trojan war. Whence it follows that the Trojan war <a id="l572"></a>&amp; Argonautic expedition were later then the days of Solomon &amp; <a id="l573"></a>Rehoboam.</p>
<p id="par27">Dionysius Halycarnassæus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n51-ref">[51]</sup> tells us that in the time of the <a id="l574"></a>Trojan war Latinus was king of the Aborigenes in Italy, &amp; that in <a id="l575"></a>the sixteenth age after that war, Romulus built Rome. By ages <a id="l576"></a>he means reigns of kings. For after Latinus he names sixteen kings <a id="l577"></a>of the Latines the last of which was Numitor in whose days Romulus <a id="l578"></a>built Rome. For Romulus was contemporary to Numitor. And after <a id="l579"></a>him Dionysius reccons six kings more over Rome to the beginning of the <a id="l580"></a>Consuls. Now these 22 kings, (if there were so many) at about 18 years to a reign one with <a id="l581"></a>another (for many of them were slain) reigned 396 years; which <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> counted backwards from the Consulship of the first Consuls <a id="l582"></a>Iunius Brutus &amp; Valerius Publicolo, place the coming of Æneas <a id="l583"></a>from Troy into Italy about 78 years after the death of <a id="l584"></a>Solomon. And by this recconing the taking of Troy will be <a id="l585"></a>about 70 or 75 years after the death of Solomon as above, &amp; <a id="l586"></a>Æneas will be contemporary to Pygmaleon &amp; Dido as  <a id="l587"></a>Virgil affirms, &amp; Rome will be built about the 35<sup>th</sup> or 37<sup>th</sup> Olympiad.</p>
<p id="par28">When the Greeks &amp; Latines were forming their technical chro<a id="l588"></a>nology, there were great disputes about the antiquity of Rome. <sup class="note" id="n52-ref">[52]</sup> The Greeks <a id="l591"></a>made it much older then the Olympiads. Some of them said that it was <a id="l592"></a>built by Æneas, others by Romus the son or grandson of Æneas, others by <a id="l593"></a>Romus the son or grandson of Latinus, king of the Aborigenes, others by <a id="l594"></a>Romus the son of Vlysses or of Ascareius or Italus. And some of the <a id="l595"></a>Latines at first fell in with the opinion of the Greeks saying that it was <a id="l596"></a>built by Romulus the son or grandson of Æneas;  Timæus Siculus made it built about the same time with Carthage. <a id="l599"></a>Ennius the Poet who flourished about 120 years after the death of Alexan<a id="l600"></a>der the great represented it built by Romulus the grandson of Æneas above an hundred years  before the <a id="l601"></a>Olympiads &amp; so did Nævius the Poet who was twenty years older then Ennius &amp; served in the first Punic war &amp; wrote the history of that war.. Hitherto nothing certain was agreed upon: but about <a id="l602"></a>this time some began to say that Rome was built a second time <a id="l603"></a>by Romulus in the 15<sup>th</sup> age after the destruction of Troy (by <a id="l604"></a>ages meaning reigns of kings,) &amp; to reccon the first fourteen <a id="l605"></a>ages or reigns till the building of Rome at about 432 years, <a id="l606"></a>&amp; the following reigns of the seven kings of Rome at 244 <a id="l607"></a>years more: both which numbers are much too long for the <a id="l608"></a>course of nature &amp; make up the time from the taking of Troy to the Regifuge according to the Cre<span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 3 characters)">{illeg}</span>. And by this recconing they placed the build<a id="l609"></a>ing of Rome upon the 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> Olympiad: whereas by reccon<a id="l610"></a>ing the reigns of kings at about 18 or 20 years  a piece one <a id="l611"></a>with another (which is according to the course of nature) the <a id="l612"></a>building of this city would have fallen upon the 36<sup>th</sup> or 37<sup>th</sup> <a id="l613"></a>Olympiad, where I place it. But the Romans having  no historian <a id="l614"></a>during the first four hundred years of their city, I forbear to meddle <a id="l615"></a>with their originals any further.</p>
<p id="par29">The expedition of Sesostris was one generation older then the <a id="l616"></a>Argonautic Expedition. For in his return back into Egypt, he left <a id="l617"></a>Æetes at Colchos, &amp; Æetes reigned there till the Argonautic Expedition, <a id="l618"></a>&amp; Prometheus was left by him with a body of men at mount Caucasus to guard <a id="l619"></a>that pass, &amp; after thirty years released by Hercules the Argonaut. At <a id="l620"></a>the return of Sesostris into Egypt, his brother Danaus fled from him <a id="l621"></a>into Greece with his fifty daughters in a long ship, after the pattern <a id="l622"></a>of which the ship Argo was built, &amp; Argus the son of Danaus was <a id="l623"></a>reputed the master builder thereof. And Nauplius the Argonaut was <a id="l624"></a>born in Greece of Amymone one of the daughters of Danaus soon <a id="l625"></a>after their arrival. And two others of the daughters of Danaus married <a id="l626"></a>Archander &amp; Archilites the sons of Achæus the son of Creusa the <a id="l627"></a>daughter of Erechtheus king of Athens, &amp; therefore the daughters <a id="l628"></a>of Danaus were three generations younger then Erechtheus, &amp; by con<a id="l629"></a>sequence contemporary to Theseus the son of Ægeus the adopted son <a id="l630"></a>of Sandion the son of Erechtheus. And Theseus in the time of the Ar<a id="l631"></a>gonautic Expedition was about 50 or 51 years of age, &amp; so was born <a id="l632"></a>about the 32<sup>th</sup> year of Solomon. For he stole Helena just<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> before that <a id="l634"></a>Expedition being then fifty years old &amp; she but seven or as some <a id="l635"></a>say, ten. Perithous the son of Ixion helped Theseus to steal Helena <a id="l636"></a>&amp; then <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n54-ref">[54]</sup> Theseus went with Perithous to steal Proserpina the daughter <a id="l638"></a>of Aidoneus &amp; was taken in the action; &amp; whilst he lay in prison Castor <a id="l639"></a>&amp; Pollux returning from the Argonautic Expedition released their sister <a id="l640"></a>Hellena &amp; captivated Æthra the mother of Theseus. Now the daughters <a id="l641"></a>of Danaus being contemporary to Theseus, &amp; some of their sons being <a id="l642"></a>Argonauts, Danaus with his daughters fled from his brother Sesostris into <a id="l643"></a>Greece about one generation before the Argonautic Expedition, &amp; therefore <a id="l644"></a>Sesostris returned into Egypt in the  reign of Rehoboam, &amp; so was <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span> Sesac. For Sesac came out of Egypt in the fift year of <a id="l645"></a>Rehoboam, &amp;<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n55-ref">[55]</sup> spent nine years in that Expedition against <a id="l646"></a>the eastern nations &amp; Greece, &amp; therefore returned back <a id="l647"></a>into Egypt in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam. Sesac &amp; Sesostris <a id="l648"></a>were therefore kings of all Egypt at one &amp; the same <a id="l649"></a>time. And they agree not only in time but also in their <a id="l650"></a>actions &amp; conquests. God gave Sesac ממלכות הארצזת the <a id="l651"></a>kingdoms of the Lands 2 Chron. 12. Where Herodotus describes <a id="l652"></a>the Expedition of Sesostris, Iosephus<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n56-ref">[56]</sup> tells us that he described the Expedition of Sesac, &amp; attributed his actions to Sesostris <a id="l654"></a>erring only in the name of the king. Corruptions of names <a id="l655"></a>are frequent in history. Sesostris was otherwise called Sesochris, <a id="l656"></a>Sesochis, Sesoosis, Sethosis, Sesonchis, Sesonchosis. Take away <a id="l657"></a>the Greek termination &amp; the names become Sesost, Sesoch, <a id="l658"></a>Sesoos, Sethos, Sesonch; which names differ very little from Sesach. <a id="l659"></a>Sesonchis &amp; Sesach differ no more from one another then Memphis <a id="l660"></a>&amp; Moph, two names of the same city.</p>
<p id="par30">Ægypt was at first divided into many little kingdoms like other <a id="l661"></a>nations, &amp; grew into one Monarchy by degrees. And the father <a id="l662"></a>of Solomons Queen was the first king of Egypt who came into Phæ<a id="l663"></a>nicia with an army. But he only took Gezer &amp; gave it to his daughter. <a id="l664"></a>Sesac the next king came out of Egypt which an army of Libyans, Troglodites <a id="l665"></a>&amp; Ethiopians (2 Chron. 12.3) &amp; therefore was then king of all those <a id="l666"></a>countries &amp; we do not read in scripture that any former king of Egypt <a id="l667"></a>who reigned over all those  nations came out of Egypt with a <a id="l668"></a>great army to conquer other kingdoms. The sacred history of the Israelites <a id="l669"></a> from the days of Abraham to the days of Solomon <a id="l670"></a>admits of no such conqueror. Sesostris reigned over all the same nations <a id="l671"></a>of the Libyans Troglodites &amp; Ethiopians &amp; in prophane history we do not <a id="l672"></a>read of any later king of Egypt who reigned over all those nations &amp; <a id="l673"></a>came out of Egypt with a great army to conquer other kingdoms. And <a id="l674"></a>therefore Sesostris &amp; Sesac must be one &amp; the same king of Egypt. <a id="l675"></a>This is no new opinion. Iosephus discovered it when he affirmed that <a id="l676"></a>Herodotus  erred in ascribing the actions of Sesac to Sesostris <a id="l677"></a>&amp; that the error was only in the name of the king. For this is as much as <a id="l678"></a>to say that the true name of him who did those actions was Sesac &amp; that <a id="l679"></a>Herodotus erred only in calling him Sesostris. Our great Chronologer <a id="l680"></a>Sir Iohn Marsham was also of opinion that Sesostris was Sesac. And <a id="l681"></a>if this be granted, it is then most certain that Sesostris came out of <a id="l682"></a>Egypt in the fift year of Rehoboam to invade the nations. And the Argonautic Expedition being one generation later then  that invasion, was certainly about  40 or 4<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>1<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> years later then the death of Solomon. Prometheus stayed in mount Caucasus 30 years &amp; then was released by Hercules: &amp; therefore the Argonautic Expedition was  thirty years after  Prometheus had been left on mount Caucasus by Sesostris.</p>
<p id="par31">I have now carried up the Chronology of the Greeks as high as <a id="l683"></a>to the Trojan war, the Argonautic Expedition &amp; the invasion of the <a id="l684"></a>nations of Asia India &amp; Greece by Sesostris, &amp; have settled it by the <a id="l685"></a>Archives of other nations: for these are the dark ages of the Greeks. <a id="l686"></a>It remains that I try if it can be carried up any higher.</p>
<p id="par32">Tatian in his book against the Greeks relates that amongst the <a id="l687"></a>Phænicians flourished three ancient Historians Theodotus, Hypsicrates, <a id="l688"></a>&amp; Mochus, who all of them delivered in their histories (translated into <a id="l689"></a>Greek by Lætus) that under one of the kings happened the rapture of <a id="l690"></a>Europa the voyage of Menelaus into Phænicia &amp; the league &amp; friendship <a id="l691"></a> between Solomon &amp; Hiram when Hiram gave his daughter to Solomon, <a id="l692"></a>&amp; supplyed him with timber for building the Temple, &amp; that the <a id="l693"></a>same is affirmed also by Menander of Pergamus. Vnder one of the <a id="l694"></a>kings that is within the compass of the age of a man. For so the phrase <a id="l695"></a>is used by Isaiah chap. <span class="smallcaps">xxiii</span>.15. Iosephus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n57-ref">[57]</sup> lets us know that the Annals <a id="l697"></a>of the Tyrians from the days of Abibalus &amp; Hiram were extant in <a id="l698"></a>his days, &amp; that Menander of Pergamus translated them into Greek, <a id="l699"></a>&amp; that Hirams friendship to Solomon &amp; assistance in building the Temple <a id="l700"></a>was mentioned in them, &amp; that the Temple was founded in the 11<sup>th</sup> year of Hiram. And by the testimony of Menander &amp; the ancient <a id="l701"></a>Phænician historians, the rapture of Europa happened not long before the <a id="l702"></a> building of Solomons Temple. The voyage of Menelaus might be in pursuit <a id="l703"></a>of Paris &amp; Helena twenty<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n58-ref">[58]</sup> years before the destruction of Troy. Solomon <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span> therefore reigned in the time between the raptures of Europa &amp; Helena, &amp; <a id="l704"></a>Europa and her brother Cadmus flourished in the days of David, Minos the <a id="l705"></a>son of Europa flourished in the days of Solomon. And the children of <a id="l706"></a>Minos (namely Androgeus his eldest son, Deucaleon his youngest son &amp; <a id="l707"></a>one of the Argonauts, Ariadne the mistress of Theseus &amp; Bacchus, &amp; <a id="l708"></a>Phædra the wife of Theseus,) flourished in the latter end of the reign <a id="l709"></a>of Solomon &amp; in the days of Rehoboam Abia &amp; Asa. And Hiram succeeded <a id="l710"></a>his father Abibalus in the 33<sup>th</sup> year of  David.</p>
<p id="par33">Rehoboam was born in the last year of king David being 41 years <a id="l711"></a>old at the death of Solomon (<span class="smallcaps">i</span> King 14.41.) &amp; therefore his father Solomon <a id="l712"></a>was born in the 18<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign or before. And two or three <a id="l713"></a>years before his birth David beseiged Rabban the Metropolis of <a id="l714"></a>the Ammonites &amp; committed adultery with Bathsheba. And the <a id="l715"></a>year before this siege began, David vanquished the Ammonites &amp; <a id="l716"></a>their confederates the Syrians of Zobah &amp; Rehob &amp; Ishtob &amp; Maacah <a id="l717"></a>&amp; Damascus, extending his dominion over all those nations as far <a id="l718"></a>as to the entring in of Hamath &amp; the river Euphrates. And before <a id="l719"></a>this was began, he smote Moab &amp; Ammon &amp; Edom, &amp; made the <a id="l720"></a>Edomites fly some of them into Egypt with their  king Hadad <a id="l721"></a>then a little child, &amp; others to the Philistims where they fortifyed <a id="l722"></a>Azoth against Israel, &amp; to other places whether they could escape. And <a id="l723"></a>before this, he had several battels with the Philistims. And all this was <a id="l724"></a>after the eighth year of his reign in which he came from Hebron to Ieru<a id="l725"></a>salem. We cannot therefore err above a year or two if we place his <a id="l726"></a>victory over Edom in the twelft year of his reign, &amp; that over Ammon <a id="l727"></a>&amp; the Syrians in the fourteenth or fifteenth. After the flight of <a id="l728"></a>Edom, the king of Edom grew up &amp; married the sister of Pharaohs <a id="l729"></a>Queen Tahaphenes or Daphnis, &amp; before the death of David, had by <a id="l730"></a>her a son called Genubah; &amp; this son was brought up among the <a id="l731"></a>children of Pharaoh. And among these children were Solomons Queen <a id="l732"></a>the chief or first born of her mothers children, &amp; her little sister <a id="l733"></a>who being a child had no breasts, &amp; her brother who sucked the <a id="l734"></a>breasts of his mother (Cant. <span class="smallcaps">vi</span>.9 &amp; <span class="smallcaps">viii</span>.1, 8.) And at about the same age <a id="l735"></a>with these children was Sesac or Sesostris. For he became king of <a id="l736"></a>Egypt in the days of Solomon (<span class="smallcaps">i</span> King <span class="smallcaps">xi</span>.40) &amp; before he began to <a id="l737"></a>reign he warred under his father, &amp; whilst he was very young <a id="l738"></a>conquered Arabia Troglodytica &amp; Libya &amp; then invaded Ethiopia, &amp; succeeding his father, reigned till the fift year of Asa. And therefore <a id="l739"></a>he was of about the same age with the children of Pharaoh above <a id="l740"></a>mentioned. And so being the brother of Solomon's Queen, he was born near the end of Davids reign, &amp; might be about 45 or 50 years <a id="l741"></a>old when he came out of Egypt with a great army to invade the East.</p>       
<p id="par34">Androgeus the eldest son of Minos upon his overcoming in the <a id="l742"></a>Athenæa or quadrennial games at Athens in his youth, was perfi<a id="l743"></a>diously slain out of envy, &amp; Minos thereupon made war upon the <a id="l744"></a>Athenians, &amp; compelled them to send every eighth year to Crete <a id="l745"></a>seven beardless youths &amp; as many young virgins to be given <a id="l746"></a>as a reward to him that should get the victory in the like games <a id="l747"></a>instituted in Crete in honour of Androgeus. These games seem to have been celebrated in the beginning of the Octaeteris, &amp; the Athe<a id="l748"></a>nea in the beginning of the Tetraeteris then brought into Crete &amp; <a id="l749"></a>Greece by the Phenicians. And upon the third payment of this <a id="l750"></a>tribute of children, that is about seventeen years after the said war was <a id="l751"></a>at an end &amp; about twenty years after the death of Androgeus, <a id="l752"></a>Theseus became victor; &amp; returned from Crete with Ariadne the <a id="l753"></a>daughter of Minos. And coming to the island Naxus or Dia,<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n59-ref">[59]</sup> Ariadne <a id="l756"></a>was there taken from him by Glaucus a commander at sea, &amp; became <a id="l757"></a>the mistress of the great Bacchus, &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n60-ref">[60]</sup> by him had two sons Phlyas &amp; <a id="l758"></a>Eumedon who were Argonauts. This Bacchus was therefore one <a id="l759"></a>generation older then the Argonauts; &amp; being king of Egypt at <a id="l760"></a>the same time with Sesostris, they are one &amp; the same king. For <a id="l761"></a>they agree also in their actions. Bacchus invaded India &amp; Greece, &amp; after he <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013r"> &lt;13r&gt; </span> was routed by the army of Perseus, &amp; the war was composed; the <a id="l762"></a>Greeks did him great honours &amp; built a Temple to him at Argos &amp; called it the Temple of the Cresian Bacchus because Ariadne was <a id="l763"></a>buried in it as Pausanias relates. Ariadne therefore died in the end of <a id="l764"></a>the war just before the return of Sesostris into Ægypt, that is, in the 13<sup>th</sup> <a id="l765"></a>or 14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam. She was taken from Theseus, &amp; upon <a id="l766"></a>the return of Bacchus from India became his mistress, &amp; accompanied <a id="l767"></a>him in his triumphs. And therefore the expedition of Theseus to Crete <a id="l768"></a>&amp; the death of his father Æqeus was about nine or ten years after <a id="l769"></a>the death of Solomon. Theseus was then a beardless young man <a id="l770"></a>suppose about 20 or 22 years old &amp; Androgeus was slain about 21 years <a id="l771"></a>before &amp; was born about 20 or 22 years before that, &amp; his father Minos <a id="l772"></a>might then be about 70 or 75 years old when he pursued Dædalus into Crete <a id="l773"></a>&amp; Europa &amp; her brother Cadmus might come into Europe two or three years <a id="l774"></a>before the birth of Minos.</p>
<p id="par35">When Sesostris returned into Egypt he left Æetes with part of his army <a id="l775"></a>at Colchos to guard that pass; &amp; Phryxus &amp; his sister Helle fled from Ino the <a id="l776"></a>daughter of Cadmus to Æetes soon after. Ino was therefore alive in the <a id="l777"></a>14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam, &amp; by consequence her father Cadmus flou<a id="l778"></a>rished in the reign of David, &amp; not before. Cadmus was the father of <a id="l779"></a>Polydorus, the father of Labdacus, the father of Laius, the father of <a id="l780"></a>Oedipus, the father of Eteocles &amp; Polynices who in their youth slew <a id="l781"></a>one another in the war of the seven captains at Thebes about <a id="l782"></a>eight or ten years after the Argonautic Expedition; &amp; Thersander <a id="l783"></a>the son of Polynices warred at Troy. These generations being by the <a id="l784"></a>eldest sons, if they be recconed at about 23 years to a generation, <a id="l785"></a>they will place the birth of Polydorus upon the 16<sup>th</sup> or 18<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l786"></a>Davids reign. And thus Cadmus might be a young man not yet mar<a id="l787"></a>ried when he came into Greece. At his first coming he sailed to <a id="l788"></a>Samothrace an island neare Thrace on the north side of Lemnus &amp; there married Harmonia the sister of Iasion &amp; <a id="l789"></a>Dardanus; which gave occasion to the Samothracian mysteries &amp; Polydorus might be their son born a year or two after <a id="l790"></a>his coming: &amp; his sister Europa might be then a young woman in <a id="l791"></a>the flower of her age. Those generations cannot well be shorter <a id="l792"></a>&amp; therefore Cadmus &amp; his son Polydorus were not younger then we <a id="l793"></a>have recconed them. Nor can they be much longer without making <a id="l794"></a> Polydorus too old to be born in Europe, &amp; to be the son of Harmonia. <a id="l795"></a>Labdacus was therefore born in the end of Davids reign, Laius in <a id="l796"></a>the 23<sup>th</sup> of Solomons &amp; Oedipus in the sixt of Rehoboams or there<a id="l797"></a>abouts.</p>
<p id="par36">Polydorus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n61-ref">[61]</sup> the son of Cadmus married Nicteis the daughter of <a id="l798"></a>Nicteus a native of Greece, &amp; dying left his kingdome &amp; young <a id="l799"></a>son Labdacus under the administration of Nicteus.

<p id="par43">Celeus king of Eleusis who was contemporary to Erechtheus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n95-ref">[95]</sup> was  <a id="l1071"></a>the son of Rharus the son of Cinnaus, &amp; in the  reign of Cranaus, Deucalion <a id="l1072"></a>fled with his sons Hellen &amp; Amphictyon from  a flood which then overflowed <a id="l1073"></a>Thessaly &amp; was called Deucalions flood.

<p id="par51">The kingdom of Macedon<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n114-ref">[114]</sup> was founded by Caranus &amp; Perdiccas who being of <a id="l1236"></a>the race of Temenus king of Argos, fled from  Argos in the reign of Phidon the <a id="l1237"></a>brother of  Caranus.

<p id="par56"><sup class="note" id="n123-ref">[123]</sup>When the Greeks &amp; Latines were forming their technical chronology there <a id="l1360"></a>were great disputes about the antiquity of Rome. The Greeks made it much <a id="l1361"></a>older then the Olympiads. Some of them said it was built by Æneas, others by <a id="l1362"></a>Romus the son or grandson of Æneas, others by Romus the son or grandson of <a id="l1363"></a>Latinus king of the Aborigenes, others by Romus the son of Vlysses or of As<a id="l1364"></a>canius or Italus. And some of the Latines at first fell in which the opinion of <a id="l1365"></a>the Greeks, saying that it was built by Romulus the son or grandson of Æneas. <a id="l1366"></a>Timæus Siculus represented it built about the same time with Carthage. Ennius <a id="l1367"></a>the Poet who flourished about 120 years after the death of Alexander the <a id="l1368"></a>great represented it built by Romulus the grandson of Æneas above an <a id="l1369"></a>hundred years before the Olympiads. And so did Nævius the poet who was <a id="l1370"></a>twenty years older then Ennius, &amp; served in the first Punic war, &amp; wrote the <a id="l1371"></a>history of that war. Hitherto nothing certain was agreed upon; but about <a id="l1372"></a>140 or 150 years after the death of Alexander the great they began <a id="l1373"></a>to say that Rome was built a second time by Romulus in the fifteenth <a id="l1374"></a>age after the destruction of Troy. By ages they meant reigns of kings, <a id="l1375"></a>&amp; recconed the first fourteen ages or reigns at about 432 years, &amp; the following <a id="l1376"></a>reigns of the seven kings of Rome at 244 years: both which numbers made <a id="l1377"></a>up the time of about  676 years from the taking of Troy to the regifuge, ac<a id="l1378"></a>cording to these chronologers, but are much too long for the course of nature. <a id="l1379"></a>And by this recconing they placed the building of Rome upon the sixt or seventh <a id="l1380"></a>Olympiad: whereas by recconing the reigns of kings at about 18 or 20 years <a id="l1381"></a>a piece one with another (which is according to the course of nature) &amp; dating <a id="l1382"></a>the recconing by the 14 reigns from the true time of the taking of Troy, &amp; that by the seven reigns from the regifuge the building of this city <a id="l1383"></a>would have fallen upon the 36<sup>th</sup> or 38<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. And to this recconing the Roman history may easily be adapted by shortning the reigns of all their kings in the proporti<a id="l1384"></a>on of about 11 to 6.

<p id="par57">When Sesostris returned from Thrace into Egypt, he left Æetes with part of <a id="l1392"></a> his army at Colchos to guard that pass, &amp; Phryxus &amp; his sister Helle fled from <a id="l1393"></a>Ino the daughter of Cadmus to Æetes soon after in a ship whose ensign was a golden <a id="l1394"></a>ram.

Cadmus was the father of Polydorus, the father of Labdacus, <a id="l1397"></a>the father of Laius, the father of Oedipus, the father of Eteocles &amp; Polynices who in <a id="l1398"></a>their youth slew one another in the war of the seven captains at Thebes about ten <a id="l1399"></a>or twelve years after the Argonautic Expedition; &amp; Thorsander the son of Polynices <a id="l1400"></a>warred at Troy. These generations being by the eldest sons who married young, if <a id="l1401"></a>they be recconed at about 24 years to a generation they will place the birth of <a id="l1402"></a>Polydorus upon the 18<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign, or thereabout. And thus Cadmus might <a id="l1403"></a>be a young man not yet married when he came first into Greece.

These generations cannot well be shorter, &amp; therefore Cadmus &amp; his son Poly<a id="l1408"></a>dorus were not younger then we have recconed them. Nor can they be much   longer <a id="l1409"></a>without making Polydorus too old to be born in Europe &amp; to be the son of Harmonia. <a id="l1410"></a>Labdacus was therefore born in the end of Davids reign, Laius in the 24<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l1411"></a>Solomon's, &amp; Oedipus in the seventh Rehoboam's, or thereabout.</p>

<p id="par62">Danaus came into Greece a year or two after the return of his brother <a id="l1500"></a>Sesac into Egypt; that is, about the fifteenth or sixteenth year of Rehoboam. <a id="l1501"></a>At length he succeeded Gelanor the brother of Eurystheus at Argos while Eu<a id="l1502"></a>rystheus reigned at Mycenæ, &amp; Eurystheus was born<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n135-ref">[135]</sup> the same year with <a id="l1504"></a>Hercules. In the time of the Argonautic expedition Castor &amp; Pollux were <a id="l1505"></a>beardles young men, &amp; their sisters Helena &amp; Clytemnestra were children, <a id="l1506"></a>&amp; their wives Phœbe &amp; Ilaira were also very young. All these with the <a id="l1507"></a>Argonauts Lynceus &amp; Idas were the grandchildren of Gorgophone the daughter <a id="l1508"></a>of Perseus the son of Danae the daughter of Acrisius &amp; Eurydice. And Perieres <a id="l1509"></a>&amp; Oebalus the husbands of Gorgophone were the sons of Cynortes the son of Amy<a id="l1510"></a>clas the brother of Eurydice. Gelanor &amp; Eurystheus above mentioned were the <a id="l1511"></a>sons of Sthenelus by Nicippe the daughter of Pelops. And Mestor or Mastor <a id="l1512"></a>the brother of Sthenelus married Lycidice another of the daughters of Pelops. <a id="l1513"></a>And Pelops married Hippodamia the daughter of Evarete the daughter of <a id="l1514"></a>Acrisius. Alcmena the mother of Hercules was the daughter of Electryo. <a id="l1515"></a>And Sthenelus Mestor &amp; Electryo were the brothers of Gorgophone &amp; sons <a id="l1516"></a>of Perseus &amp; Andromeda. And the Argonaut Æsculapius was the grandson <a id="l1517"></a>of Leucippus &amp; Phlegia, &amp; Leucippus was the son of Amyclas the brother of <a id="l1518"></a>Eurydice, &amp; Amyclas &amp; Eurydice were the children of Lacedemon &amp; Sparta. <a id="l1519"></a>And Capaneus one of the seven captains against Thebes was the husband of <a id="l1520"></a>Euadne the daughter of Iphis the son of Alector the son of Anaxagoras the <a id="l1521"></a>son of Megapenthes the son of Prætus the brother of Acrisius. And from these <a id="l1522"></a>generations it may be gathered that Perseus, Cynortes, &amp; Anaxagoras were <a id="l1523"></a>of about the same age with Minos, Pelops, Ægeus &amp; Sesac : &amp; that Acrisius, <a id="l1524"></a>Prætus, Eurydice &amp; Amyclas being two little generations older were of <a id="l1525"></a>about the same age with king David &amp; Erechtheus: &amp; that the temple of <a id="l1526"></a>Iuno Argiva was built about the latter end of Davids reign or the beginning <a id="l1527"></a>of Solomons, the same being built by Eurydice to her daughter Danae as above, <a id="l1528"></a>or as some say by Pirasus or Piranthus the son &amp; successor of Argus &amp; great <a id="l1529"></a>grandson of Phoroneus. For the first priestess of that goddess was Callithyia <a id="l1530"></a>the daughter of Piranthus. Callithyia was succeeded by Alcinæ about three gene<a id="l1531"></a>rations before the taking of Troy, that is, about the middle of Solomons reign. In her <a id="l1532"></a>priesthood the Siculi passed out of Italy into Sicily. Afterwards Hypermnestra <a id="l1533"></a>the daughter of Danaus became priestess of this Goddess, &amp; she flourished in the <a id="l1534"></a>times next after the Argonautic expedition. And Admeta the daughter of Eu<a id="l1535"></a>ristheus was priestess of this Iuno about the times of the Trojan war: Andromeda <a id="l1536"></a>the wife of Perseus was the daughter of Cepheus an Egyptian the son of Belus <a id="l1537"></a>(according to<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n136-ref">[136]</sup> Herodotus) &amp; the Egyptian Belus was Ammon. Perseus took her from Ioppa <a id="l1538"></a>where Cepheus (I think a kinsman of Solomon's queen) resided in the days of Solomon. <a id="l1539"></a>Acrisius &amp; Prætus were the sons of Abas. But this Abas was not the same man with Abas the <a id="l1540"></a>grandson of Ægyptus, but a much older prince who built Abæ in Phocis, &amp; might be the <a id="l1541"></a>prince from whom the island Eubæa <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n137-ref">[137]</sup> was anciently called Abantis, &amp; the people thereof <a id="l1543"></a>Abantes.

This <a id="l1547"></a>Abas therefore flourished three or four generations before the Argonautic expedition, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024r"> &lt;24r&gt; </span> &amp; so might be the father of Acrisius.

This I <a id="l1612"></a>conceive was done when Amphictyon &amp; Acrisius were aged &amp; fit to be coun<a id="l1613"></a>cellours, suppose in the latter half of the reign of David &amp; beginning of the <a id="l1614"></a>reign of Solomon.

The council <a id="l1617"></a>of Thermopylæ included twelve nations of the Greeks without Attica, &amp; therefore <a id="l1618"></a>Amphictyon did not then reign at Athens.

<p id="par67">For between the reigns of Cranaus &amp; Erechtheus chronologers place also <a id="l1621"></a>Erechthonius &amp; his son Pandion. But I take this Erechthonius &amp; this his son Pandion <a id="l1622"></a>to be the same with Erechtheus &amp; his son &amp; successor Pandion, the names being only <a id="l1623"></a>repeated which a little variation in the list of the kings of Attica. For Erechthonius <a id="l1624"></a>(he that was the son of the earth nursed by Minerva) is by Homer called Erech<a id="l1625"></a>theus. And Themistius<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n146-ref">[146]</sup> tells us that it was Erechtheus who first joyned a chariot <a id="l1626"></a>to horses.

<p id="par70">Thucydides<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n149-ref">[149]</sup> tells us further that the Greeks began to come into Sicily <a id="l1637"></a>almost three hundred years after the Siculi had invaded that island with an <a id="l1638"></a>an army out of Italy.

<p id="par71">The kingdom of Macedon was <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n151-ref">[151]</sup> founded by Caranus &amp; Perdiccas who <a id="l1647"></a>being of the race of Temenus king of Argos, fled from Argos in the reign <a id="l1648"></a>of  Phidon the brother of Caranus. Temenus was one of the <a id="l1649"></a>three brothers who led the Heraclides into Peloponesus, &amp; shared the con<a id="l1650"></a>quest amongst themselves. He obteined Argos, &amp; after him &amp; his son Cisus, <a id="l1651"></a>the kingdom of Argos became divided among the posterity of Temenus <a id="l1652"></a>untill Phidon reunited it expelling his  own kindred. Phidon <a id="l1653"></a>grew potent, appointed weights &amp; measures in Peloponesus, &amp; coyned <a id="l1654"></a>silver money, &amp; removing the Pisæans &amp; Eleans, presided in the Olympic <a id="l1655"></a>games, but was soon after subdued by the Eleans &amp; Spartans.

Its probable that Caranus &amp; Perdiccas were con<a id="l1661"></a>temporaries &amp; fled about the same time from Phidon, &amp; at first <a id="l1662"></a>erected small principalities, which after the death of Caranus became <a id="l1663"></a>one under Perdiccas.

Alexander was contemporary to Xerxes king of Persia, <a id="l1666"></a>&amp; died An. 4, Olymp. 79, &amp; was succeeded by Perdiccas II, &amp; he by his son <a id="l1667"></a>Archelaus. And Thucydides<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n154-ref">[154]</sup> tells us that there were eight kings of Mace<a id="l1669"></a>don before this Archelaus. Now by recconing about 40 years a piece to <a id="l1670"></a>these kings, Chronologers have made Phidon &amp; Caranus older then the Olympiads: <a id="l1671"></a>whereas if we should reccon their reigns at about 18 or 20 years <a id="l1672"></a>a piece, the first seven reigns counted backwards from the death of <a id="l1673"></a>Alexander will place the dominion of Phidon &amp; the beginning of the <a id="l1674"></a>kingdom of Macedon under Perdiccas &amp; Caranus upon the 46<sup>th</sup> or 47 Olym<a id="l1675"></a>piad, or thereabout. It could scarce be earlier because Leocides the <a id="l1676"></a>son of Phidon, &amp; Megacles the son of Alcmæon, at one &amp; the same <a id="l1677"></a>time courted Agarista the daughter of Clisthenes king of Sicyon (as <a id="l1678"></a><sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n155-ref">[155]</sup> Herodotus tells us,) &amp; the Amphictyons by the advice of Solon made <a id="l1679"></a>Alcmæon &amp; Clisthenes &amp; Eurolycus king of Thessaly, commanders of <a id="l1680"></a>their army in their war against Cyrrha, &amp; the Cyrrheans were con<a id="l1681"></a>quered An. 2 Olymp. 47 according to the Marbles, or perhaps a little later.

For<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n157-ref">[157]</sup> in the 48<sup>th</sup> Olympiad the Eleans <a id="l1693"></a>entered the country of the Pisæans, suspecting their designes but were prevailed <a id="l1694"></a>upon to return home quietly. Afterwards the Pisæans confederated with several <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span> other Greek nations &amp; made war upon the Eleans, &amp; in the end were <a id="l1695"></a>beaten.

For <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n158-ref">[158]</sup> in the 50<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, for putting an end to the contentions <a id="l1697"></a>between the kings about presiding, two men were chosen by lot out of the <a id="l1698"></a>city Elis to preside; &amp; their number in the 65<sup>th</sup> Olympiad was increased <a id="l1699"></a>to nine, &amp; afterwards to ten: &amp; these judges were called Helenodicæ, judges <a id="l1700"></a>for or in the name of Greece. Pausanias tells us that the Eleans called in <a id="l1701"></a>Phidon &amp; together with him celebrated the 8<sup>th</sup> Olympiad; he should have <a id="l1702"></a>said the 48<sup>th</sup> or 49<sup>th</sup> Olympiad: but Herodotus tells us that Phidon re<a id="l1703"></a>moved the Eleans. And both might be true. The Eleans might call in <a id="l1704"></a>Phidon against the Pisæans, &amp; upon overcoming be refused by Phidon, <a id="l1705"></a>&amp; then confederate with the Spartans, &amp; by their assistance overthrow <a id="l1706"></a>the kingdome of Phidon, &amp; recover their ancient right of presiding in <a id="l1707"></a>the games.</p>
<p id="par73">Strabo<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n159-ref">[159]</sup> tells us that Phidon was the tenth from Temenus, not the tenth <a id="l1709"></a>king (for between Cisus &amp; Phidon they reigned not,) but the tenth from <a id="l1710"></a>father to son including Temenus. If 27 years be recconed to a genera<a id="l1711"></a>tion by the eldest sons, the nine intervalls will amount unto 243 years; <a id="l1712"></a>which being counted back from the 48<sup>th</sup> Olympiad in which Phidon flourished, <a id="l1713"></a>they will place the return of the Heraclides about 50 years before the <a id="l1714"></a>beginning of the Olympiads as above.

<p id="par74">Between the taking of Troy &amp; the death of Codrus there reigned six kings at <a id="l1718"></a>Athens, viz<sup>t</sup> Demophoon, Oxyntes, Aphidas, Thymetes, Melanthus &amp; Codrus, the third <a id="l1719"></a>&amp; fourth of which reigned together but nine years according to Chronologers. If to the <a id="l1720"></a>other four we should allow about 21 or 22 years a piece  one with another, they <a id="l1721"></a>would place the death of Codrus about 95 years after the  taking of <a id="l1722"></a>Troy, or 15 years after the return of the Heraclides into Peloponesus. Then reigned <a id="l1723"></a>twelve  Archons for life successively who being elected &amp; by consequence <a id="l1724"></a>grown up to years of discretion before they began to reign, they might <a id="l1725"></a>reign one with another about 13 or 14 years a piece, &amp; all together about <a id="l1726"></a>162 years.

<p id="par78"><sup class="note" id="n160-ref">[160]</sup>When the Greeks &amp; Latines were forming their technical chronology, there <a id="l1770"></a>were great disputes about the antiquity of Rome. The Greeks made it much older <a id="l1771"></a>then the Olympiads. Some of them said it was built by Æneas, others by Romus <a id="l1772"></a>the son or grandson of Æneas, others by Romus the son or grandson of <a id="l1773"></a>Latinus king of the Aborigenes, others by Romus the son of Vlysses or <a id="l1774"></a>of Ascaneus or Italus. And some of the Latines at first fell in with the <a id="l1775"></a>opinion of the Greeks, saying that it was built by Romulus the son or grand<a id="l1776"></a>son of Æneas. Timǽus Siculus represented it built about the same time <a id="l1777"></a>with Carthage. Ennius the Poet who flourished about 120 years after <a id="l1778"></a>the death of Alexander the great, represented it built by Romulus the grand<a id="l1779"></a>son of Æneas, above an hundred years before the Olympiads. And so did <a id="l1780"></a>Nævius the poet who was twenty years older then Ennius &amp; served in <a id="l1781"></a>the first Punic war, &amp; wrote the history of that war. Hitherto nothing <a id="l1782"></a>certain was agreed upon: but about this time they began to say that <a id="l1783"></a>Rome was built a second time by Romulus in the fifteenth age after the <a id="l1784"></a>destruction of Troy. By ages they meant reigns of kings, &amp; recconed the <a id="l1785"></a>first fourteen ages or reigns at about 432 years, &amp; the following reigns <a id="l1786"></a>of the seven kings of Rome at 244 years more: both which numbers made <a id="l1787"></a>up the time of about 676 years from the taking of Troy to the Regifuge <a id="l1788"></a>according to these Chronologers, but are much too long for the course of <a id="l1789"></a>nature. And, by this recconing they placed the building of Rome upon the <a id="l1790"></a>sixt or seventh Olympiad: whereas by recconing the reigns of kings at about <a id="l1791"></a>18 or 20 years a piece one with another (which is according to the course <a id="l1792"></a>of nature) &amp; dating the recconing from the true time of the taking of <a id="l1793"></a>Troy, the building of this city would have fallen upon the 36<sup>th</sup> or 37<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. <a id="l1794"></a>But the Romans having no historian during the first four hundred years of their city, &amp; <a id="l1795"></a>their records being burnt by the Gauls 64 years before the death of Alexander the <a id="l1796"></a>great, I forbear to meddle with their originals any further.</p>
<p id="par79">When Sesostris returned from Greece into Egypt, he left Æetes with part <a id="l1797"></a>of his army at Colchos to guard that pass; &amp; Phrixus &amp; his sister  Helle fled from <a id="l1798"></a>Ino the daughter of Cadmus to Æetes soon after in a ship whose ensigne was a golden <a id="l1799"></a>Ram. Ino was therefore alive in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam, the year in which <a id="l1800"></a>Sesostris returned; &amp; by consequence her father Cadmus flourished in the reign <a id="l1801"></a>of David, &amp; not before. Cadmus was the father of Polydorus, the father of Labdacus, <a id="l1802"></a>the father of Laius, the father of Oedipus the father of Eteocles &amp; Polynices who <a id="l1803"></a>in their youth slew one another in the war of the seven captains at Thebes <a id="l1804"></a>about ten or twelve years after the Argonautic expedition; &amp; Thersander the <a id="l1805"></a>son of Polynices warred at Troy. These generations being by the eldest sons who <a id="l1806"></a>married young, if they be recconed at about 23 years to a generation they will place <a id="l1807"></a>the birth of Polydorus upon the 18<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign or thereabout. And thus <a id="l1808"></a>Cadmus might be a young man not yet married when he came first into Greece. <a id="l1809"></a>At his first coming he sailed to Samothrace, an island neare Thrace on the north <a id="l1810"></a>side of Lemnos, &amp; there married Harmonia the sister of Iasion &amp; Dardanus, which <a id="l1811"></a>gave occasion to the Samothracian mysteries: &amp; Polydorus might be their son born <a id="l1812"></a>the year after his coming, &amp; his sister Europa might be then a young woman in the <a id="l1813"></a>flower of her age. These generations cannot well be shorter, &amp; therefore Cadmus <a id="l1814"></a>&amp; his son Polydorus were not younger then we have recconed them. Nor can they <a id="l1815"></a>be much longer without making Polydorus too old to be born in Europe &amp; to be the son <a id="l1816"></a>of Harmonia. Labdacus was therefore born in the end of Davids reign, Laius in <a id="l1817"></a>the 24<sup>th</sup> year of Solomon's, &amp; Oedipus in the seventh of Rehoboams, or thereabout.</p>

It was at first a little one &amp; grew mighty towards the south &amp; <a id="l1910"></a>towards the east &amp; up to the host of heaven, but Antiochus did not so. He made no conquests. The little <a id="l1911"></a>horn magnified himself even to the Prince of the host of heaven &amp; cast down his sanctuary to the ground, <a id="l1912"></a>&amp; so did not Antiochus. He did not cast down the temple to the ground nor stand up against the prince of princes. The little horn  acted till the last end <a id="l1913"></a>of the indignation, that is, till the last end of Gods indignation against the Iews: &amp; his indignation against <a id="l1914"></a>them is not yet at an end. The  sanctuary continued cast down 2300 days before it was cleansed <a id="l1915"></a>&amp; days in sacred prophesy are put for years Ezek. <span class="smallcaps">iv</span>.5, 6.</p>

<p id="par89">For pointing out the time when the little horn was to rise, the prophet described  <a id="l1916"></a>very particularly the actions of the kings of the north &amp; south till he comes down to the eighth <a id="l1917"></a>year of Antiochus Epiphanes in which the Romans were to conquer Macedon. And then he proceeds by <a id="l1918"></a>large steps to describe the affairs of the Roman Empire down to the great tribulation &amp; the re<a id="l1919"></a>surrection  &amp; judgment of the dead called by Daniel the time of the end. And then he <a id="l1920"></a>shews the relation of this prophesy to the former by setting down the  time of the reign of the little <a id="l1921"></a>horn of Daniels fourth Beast, &amp; mentioning the further time until God should have accomplished to scatter the <a id="l1922"></a>power of the holy people, that is untill the  end of 2300 days <a id="l1923"></a>when the sanctuary should be cleansed, which was to be also at the end of the 1290 days dated from <a id="l1924"></a>some period not yet considered by interpreters.</p>

<p id="par91">And in the reign of Hadrian he built a temple to Iupiter Olympius on mount <a id="l1925"></a>Sion where the temple of the Iews had stood, &amp; made a most bloody war against <a id="l1926"></a>the Iews &amp; banished them from Iudea upon pain of death, &amp; to deterr them from returning placed the statue of a hog <a id="l1927"></a>on one of the gates of the city.  And the vision concerning the daily sacrifice taken <a id="l1928"></a>away , &amp; the transgression of desolation set up to give both the sanctuary &amp; the host to be <a id="l1929"></a>troden under foot was to continue unto two thousand &amp; three hundred (prophetic) days <a id="l1930"></a>&amp; then the sanctuary  was to be cleansed, And this was to be at the time of the end;  <a id="l1931"></a>&amp; at the last end of the indignation, that is, at the last end of  the long captivity &amp; dispersion of <a id="l1932"></a>the Iews predicted by Moses &amp; the prophets; which is not yet at an end. Thus the <a id="l1933"></a>little horn grew mighty, but not by his own power; not by the power of the posterity <a id="l1934"></a>of Iavan, but by that of the nations of Spain, France, Germany, Helvetia   &amp; Dacia conquered <a id="l1936"></a>by   Romans &amp; those which composed the ten horns of the fourth beast.</p>
<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Chap. <a id="l1937"></a><br>On the prophesy of the Scripture of truth.</h2>

<p id="par93">In this prophesy which was given in the third year of Cyrus, after the angel Gabriel had prædicted the reign of three kings  in <a id="l1940"></a>Persia,  (Cyrus, Cambyses, &amp; Darius Hystaspis) &amp; added that the fourth (Xerxes) should be far richer <a id="l1941"></a>then they all, &amp; by his strength through his riches should stirr up all against the realm of Greece, he <a id="l1942"></a>passes on to the rise of the Greek Empire, saying, And a mighty king (Alexander the great) shal stand <a id="l1943"></a>up that shall rule with great dominion &amp; do according to his will. And when he shall stand up his <a id="l1944"></a>kingdom shall be broken , &amp; shall be divided towards the four winds of heaven, &amp; not to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027v"> &lt;27v&gt; </span> his posterity nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be pluckt up even <a id="l1945"></a>for others besides those. Then he proceeds to describe the actions of two of the four, the kings of  <a id="l1946"></a>Egypt &amp; Syria by the names of the kings of the south &amp; north, &amp; carries on the description very particularly <a id="l1947"></a>till he comes to the eight year of Antiochus Epiphanes, the year in which Antiochus was frighted out <a id="l1948"></a>of Egypt by the ships of Kittim &amp; spoiled the temple . And this is done to point out exactly the time <a id="l1949"></a>of the latter end of the kingdome of the four horns when the transgressors should come <a id="l1950"></a>to the full &amp; the little horn, the horn of Kittim,  should rise out of one of the four. For in <a id="l1951"></a>the same year that the ships of Kittim frighted Antiochus out of Egypt, the armies of Kittim <a id="l1952"></a>conquered the kingdom of Macedon the principal horn of the four. And this is exprest by Daniel <a id="l1953"></a>in these few words: <em class="underline">And after him arms shall stand up</em>.</p>
<p id="par94">Arms (<em class="underline">brachia</em>) are put for armies.  And as ממלכ signifies <em class="underline">after the King</em> Dan <span class="smallcaps">xi</span>.8. <a id="l1954"></a>so החנן may signify <em class="underline">after him</em> Dan. <span class="smallcaps">xi</span>.31. After him armies shall stand up, the <a id="l1955"></a>armies of Kittim that is the Romans. They stood up gradually by conquering the  Macedonians, Carthagi<a id="l1956"></a>nians, Armenians Syrians &amp; Egyptians. These conquests were finished by the fall of <a id="l1957"></a>Egypt in the reign of Augustus Cæsar?. And then these Arms polluted the sanctuary of <a id="l1958"></a>strength  &amp; took away the daily sacrifice in the reign <a id="l1959"></a>of Nero &amp; Vespatian, &amp;  placed the abomination that maketh <a id="l1960"></a>desolate by building a temple to Iupiter Olympius on mount Sion in the reign of Hadrian. For the <a id="l1961"></a>building of this temple  caused the Iews to rebell under Barchochab &amp; <a id="l1962"></a>in that rebellion vast multitudes of the Iews were slain by the Romans &amp; in the end <a id="l1963"></a>of the war the Iews were  expelled from Iudæa upon pain of death &amp; have ever since <a id="l1964"></a>continued in dispersion.</p>
<p id="par95">For pointing out the time exactly when the little horn was to rise up, the prophet <a id="l1965"></a>describes  very particularly the actions of the kings of the south &amp; north <a id="l1966"></a>till he comes down to the eighth year of Antiochus Epiphanes in which the Romans <a id="l1967"></a>conquered Macedon.

And after he hath described the <a id="l1970"></a>ceasing of the Iewish worship  &amp; the  desolation  of Iudea &amp; dispersion <a id="l1971"></a>of the Iews, he thus proceeds to the affairs of the Christians. <em class="underline">And such as do wickedly <a id="l1972"></a>against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries, but the people that do know <a id="l1973"></a>their God shall be strong</em> (under persecutions) <em class="underline">&amp; do exploits.

<p id="par102">Thucydides<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n163-ref">[163]</sup> tells us further that the Greeks began to come into Sicily almost <a id="l2042"></a>three hundred years after the Siculi had invaded that island with an army out of <a id="l2043"></a>Italy. And therefore that invasion was almost 631 years before the end of the Pelopo<a id="l2044"></a>nesian war, that is, almost as early as the 27<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign. Whence it <a id="l2045"></a>may be placed in the reign of Solomon. Hellanicus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n164-ref">[164]</sup> tells us that it was in the third <a id="l2047"></a>generation before the Trojan war, &amp; in the 26<sup>th</sup> year of the priesthood of Alcinoe <a id="l2048"></a>priestess of Iuno Argiva: &amp; Philistius of Syracuse, that it was 80 years before <a id="l2049"></a>the Trojan war. Whence it follows that the Trojan war &amp; Argonautic expedition <a id="l2050"></a>were later then the days of Solomon &amp; Rehoboam.</p>
<p id="par103">The kingdom of Macedon was<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n165-ref">[165]</sup> founded by Caranus &amp; Perdiccas, who being <a id="l2051"></a>of the race of Temenus king of Argos, fled from Argos in the reign of Phidon <a id="l2052"></a>the brother of Caranus. Temenus was one of the three brothers who led the <a id="l2053"></a>Heraclides into Peloponesus, &amp; shared the conquest among themselves. He obteined <a id="l2054"></a>Argos, &amp; after him &amp; his son Cisus, the kingdom of Argos became divided among <a id="l2055"></a>the posterity of Temenus untill Phidon reunited it, expelling his own kindred. <a id="l2056"></a>Phidon grew potent, appointed weights &amp; measures in Peloponesus, &amp; coyned <a id="l2057"></a>silver money; &amp; removing the Pisæans &amp; Eleans, presided in the Olympic <a id="l2058"></a>games; but was soon after subdued by the Eleans &amp; Spartans. Herodotus<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n166-ref">[166]</sup> reccons <a id="l2059"></a>that Perdiccas was the first king of Macedon. Later writers as Livy, Pausanias <a id="l2060"></a>&amp; Suidas, make Caranus the first king. Iustin calls Perdiccas the successor of <a id="l2061"></a>Caranus &amp; Solinus saith that Perdiccas succeeded Caranus &amp; was the first that <a id="l2062"></a>obteined the name of king. Its probable that Caranus &amp; Perdiccas were contempo<a id="l2063"></a>raries, &amp; fled about the same time from Phidon, &amp; at first erected small prin<a id="l2064"></a>cipalities in Macedonia which after the death of Caranus became one under Per<a id="l2065"></a>diccas. Herodotus<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n167-ref">[167]</sup> tells us that after Perdiccas reigned Aræus (or Argæus,) Philip, <a id="l2066"></a>Aeropus, Alcetes, Amyntas, &amp; Alexander successively. Alexander was con<a id="l2067"></a>temporary to Xerxes king of Persia, &amp; died An. 4 Olymp. 79, &amp; was succeeded <a id="l2068"></a>by Perdiccas II, &amp; he by his son Archelaus. And Thucydides<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n168-ref">[168]</sup> tells that <a id="l2070"></a>there were eight kings of Macedon before this Archelaus. Now by recconing <a id="l2071"></a>above forty years a piece to these kings, Chronologers have made Phidon &amp; <a id="l2072"></a>Caranus older then the Olympiads: whereas if we should reccon their reigns <a id="l2073"></a>at about 18 or 20 years a piece, the first seven reigns counted backwards <a id="l2074"></a>from the death of Alexander will place the dominion of Phidon &amp; the begin<a id="l2075"></a>ing of the kingdom of Macedon under Perdiccas &amp; Caranus upon the 46<sup>th</sup> <a id="l2076"></a>or 47<sup>th</sup> Olympiad or thereabouts.

<p id="par108">When the Greeks &amp; Latines were forming their technical chronology, <a id="l2161"></a>there were great disputes about the antiquity of Rome. <sup class="note" id="n176-ref">[176]</sup> The Greeks made it much <a id="l2163"></a>older then the Olympiads. Some of them said it was built by Æneas, others by Romus <a id="l2164"></a>the son or grandson of Æneas, others by Romus the son or grandson of Latinus king <a id="l2165"></a>of the Aborigenes, others by Romus the son of Vlysses or of Ascanius or Italus. And <a id="l2166"></a>some of the Latines at first fell in with the opinion of the Greeks, saying that it <a id="l2167"></a>was built by Romulus the son or grandson of Æneas. Timæus Siculus represented <a id="l2168"></a>it built about the same time with Carthage. Ennius the Poet who flourished about <a id="l2169"></a>120 years after the death of Alexander the great, represented it built by Ro<a id="l2170"></a>mulus the grandson of Æneas above an hundred years before the Olympiads. <a id="l2171"></a>And so did Nævius the poet who was twenty years older then Ennius, &amp; served <a id="l2172"></a>in the first Punic war, &amp; wrote the history of that war. Hitherto nothing <a id="l2173"></a>certain was agreed upon: but about 140 or 150 years after the death of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p031r"> &lt;31r&gt; </span> Alexander the great they began to say that Rome was built a second time <a id="l2174"></a>by Romulus in the fifteenth age after the destruction of Troy. By ages they <a id="l2175"></a>meant reigns of kings &amp; recconed the first fourteen ages or reigns at about <a id="l2176"></a>432 years, &amp; the following reigns of the seven kings of Rome at 244 years: <a id="l2177"></a>both which numbers made up the time of about 676 years from the taking of Troy <a id="l2178"></a>to the Regifuge according to these Chronologers, but are much too long for the <a id="l2179"></a>course of nature. And by this recconing they placed the building of Rome upon the <a id="l2180"></a>sixt or seventh Olympiad: whereas by recconing the reigns of kings at about <a id="l2181"></a>18 or 20 years a piece one with another (which is according to the course of nature) <a id="l2182"></a>&amp; dating the recconing from the true time of the taking of Troy, the building <a id="l2183"></a>of this city would have fallen upon the 36<sup>th</sup> or 37<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. But the Romans <a id="l2184"></a>having no historian during the first four hundred years of their city, &amp; their <a id="l2185"></a>records being burnt by the Gauls 64 years before the death of Alexander the <a id="l2186"></a>great, I forbear to meddle with their originals any further.</p>
<p id="par109">When Sesostris returned from Thrace into Ægypt, he left Æetes with part <a id="l2187"></a>of his army at Colchos to guard that pass; &amp; Phryxus &amp; his sister Helle fled from Ino <a id="l2188"></a>the daughter of Cadmus to Æetes soon after in a ship whose ensigne was a golden Ram. <a id="l2189"></a>Ino was therefore alive in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam, the year in which Sesostris <a id="l2190"></a>returned; &amp; by consequence her father Cadmus flourished in the reign of David, <a id="l2191"></a>&amp; not before. Cadmus was the father of Polydorus, the father of Labdacus, the father <a id="l2192"></a>of Laius, the father of Oedipus, the father of Eteocles &amp; Polynices who in their youth <a id="l2193"></a>slew one another in the war of the seven captains at Thebes about ten or twelve <a id="l2194"></a> years after the Argonautic Expedition; &amp; Thersander the son of <a id="l2195"></a>Polynices warred at Troy. These generations being by the eldest sons who married <a id="l2196"></a>young, if they be recconed at about 24 years to a generation they will place the <a id="l2197"></a>birth of Polydorus upon the 18<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign or thereabout.

These generations cannot well be shorter, &amp; therefore Cadmus <a id="l2204"></a>&amp; his son Polydorus were not younger then we have recconed them. Nor can they <a id="l2205"></a>be much longer without making Polydorus too old to be born in Europe &amp; to be <a id="l2206"></a>the son of Harmonia.

And Mestor <a id="l2314"></a>or Mastor the brother of Sthenelus married Lycidice another of the <a id="l2315"></a>daughters of Pelops. And Pelops married Hippodamia the daughter of <a id="l2316"></a>Evarete the daughter of Acrisius. Alcmena the  mother of Hercules <a id="l2317"></a>was the daughter of Electryo. And Sthenelus Mestor &amp; Electryo were the <a id="l2318"></a>brothers of Gorgophone &amp; sons of Perseus &amp; Andromeda. And the Argonaut <a id="l2319"></a>Æsculapius was the grandson of Leucippus &amp; Phlegia, &amp; Leucippus was the <a id="l2320"></a>son of Amyclas the brother of Eurydice, &amp; Amyclas &amp; Eurydice were the <a id="l2321"></a>children of Lacedemon &amp; Sparta. And Capaneus, one of the seven capitains <a id="l2322"></a>against Thebes, was the husband of Euadne the daughter of Iphis the son <a id="l2323"></a>of Elector the son of Anaxagoras the son of Megapenthes the son of <a id="l2324"></a>Prætus the brother of Acrisius. And from these generations it may be <a id="l2325"></a>gathered that Perseus, Cynortes, &amp; Anaxagoras were of about the same age with Minos, Pelops, Ægeus, &amp; Sesac: &amp; that Acrisius, Prætus, Eury<a id="l2326"></a>dice &amp; Amyclas being two little generations older, were of about the same <a id="l2327"></a>age with king David &amp; Erectheus: &amp; that the Temple of Iuno Argiva <a id="l2328"></a>was built neare the end of Davids reign or the beginning of Solomon's, the <a id="l2329"></a>same being built by Eurydice to her daughter Danae, as above; or as <a id="l2330"></a>some say by Pirasus or Piranthus the son &amp; successor of Argus, &amp; great <a id="l2331"></a>grandson of Phoroneus. For the first priestess of that goddess was Cal<a id="l2332"></a>lethyia the daughter of Piranthus. Callethyia was succeeded by Alcinoe <a id="l2333"></a>about three generations before the taking of Troy, that is about the <a id="l2334"></a>middle of Solomon's reign. In her Priesthood the Siculi passed out of Italy <a id="l2335"></a>into Sicily. Afterwards Hypernestra the daughter of Danaus became <a id="l2336"></a>priestess of this Goddess, &amp; she flourished in the times next before the Argonautic expedition. And Admeta the daughter of Euristheus was <a id="l2337"></a>priestess of this Iuno about the times of the Trojan warr. Andromeda <a id="l2338"></a>the wife of Perseus was the daughter of Cepheus an Egyptian the son <a id="l2339"></a>of Belus (according to <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n186-ref">[186]</sup> Herodotus) &amp; the Egyptian Belus was Ammon. <a id="l2340"></a>Perseus took her from Ioppa where Cepheus (I think a kinsman of Solomon's <a id="l2341"></a>queen) resided in the days of Solomon. Acrisius &amp; Prætus were the sons <a id="l2342"></a>of Abas. But this Abas was not the same man with  Abas the grandson of Danaus, but a much <a id="l2343"></a>older Prince who built Abæ in Phocis, &amp; might be the Prince from whom the <a id="l2344"></a>island Eubæa<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n187-ref">[187]</sup> was anciently called Abantis, &amp; the people thereof Abantes. <a id="l2347"></a>For Apollonius Rhodius<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n188-ref">[188]</sup> tells us that the Argonaut Canthus was the son of Ca<a id="l2349"></a>nethus, &amp; that Canethus was of the posterity of Abas; &amp; the commentator <a id="l2350"></a>upon Apollonius tells us further that from this Abas the inhabitants of Eubæa <a id="l2351"></a>were anciently called Abantes. This Abas therefore flourished three or four <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p034r"> &lt;34r&gt; </span> generations before the Argonautic expedition, &amp; so might be the <a id="l2352"></a>father of Acrisius.

And they might come from Egypt under Abas <a id="l2354"></a>into Eubæa &amp; from thence into Peloponnesus. Among the kings of Argos <a id="l2355"></a>are recconed Sthenelus the son of Perseus, &amp; Gelanor the son of Sthenelus: <a id="l2356"></a>but Gelanor was ejected by Danaus in the beginning of his reign.
