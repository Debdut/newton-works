<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Chap. IV. <a id="l1"></a>Of the Babylonian Empire</h2>
<p id="par1">After the regions upon Tigris &amp; Euphrates became free from the <a id="l2"></a>dominion of Egypt, Babylon &amp; Nineveh (cities built soon after the flood) <a id="l3"></a>continued for some time under their own kings. And when the kings of Ni<a id="l4"></a>neveh began to conquer their neighbours the husband of Semiramis reigned over Babylon &amp; she <a id="l5"></a>succeeded him being five generations older then Nitocris. And soon after reigned Nabonassar <a id="l6"></a>in whose days a body of Egyptians flying from Sabacon carried to Babylon <a id="l7"></a>the Egyptian year of 365 days &amp; founded the Astronomical Æra of this <a id="l8"></a>king as above, beginning the years thereof on the very same day with <a id="l9"></a>the Astronomical years of Egypt. And in the year of Nabonassar 68 <a id="l10"></a>Asserhadon king of Assyria conquered Chaldea &amp; Susiana &amp; captivated <a id="l11"></a>the people placing many of them in Samaria, &amp; carried the people of <a id="l12"></a>Samaria captive into Assyria. And thus Chaldea &amp; Susiana became pro<a id="l13"></a>vinces of Assyria for a time, but at length revolted, &amp; in conjunction <a id="l14"></a>with the Medes, destroyed Nineveh.</p>
<p id="par2">By the fall of the Assyrian Empire, the kingdoms of the Chaldeans <a id="l15"></a>&amp; Medes grew great &amp; potent. The reigns of the kings of Babylon are <a id="l16"></a>stated in Ptolomy's Canon: for understanding of which, you are to note <a id="l17"></a>that every kings reign in that Canon began with the last Thoth of his <a id="l18"></a>Predecessor &amp; ended with the last Thoth of his own reign, as I gather <a id="l19"></a>by comparing the reigns of the Roman Emperors in that Canon with <a id="l20"></a>their reigns recorded in years months &amp; days by other authors. Whence <a id="l21"></a>it appears from that Canon that Asserhadon died in the year of Nabonassar <a id="l22"></a>81, Saosducheus his successor in the year 101, Chiniladon in the year <a id="l23"></a>123, Nabopolassar in the year 144, &amp; Nebuchadnezzar in the year <a id="l24"></a>187. All these kings reigned successively over Babylon, &amp; this last king <a id="l25"></a>died in the 37th year of Iehojachin's captivity (2 King. XXV. 27) &amp; there<a id="l26"></a>fore Iehojachin was captivated in the 150<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonassar.</p>
<p id="par3">This captivity was in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's <a id="l27"></a>reign over Iudea (2 King. XXIV. 12) &amp; eleventh of Iehojakim's. For the <a id="l28"></a>first year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign was the fourth of Iehojakim's (Ier. <a id="l29"></a>XXV. 1) &amp; Iehojakim reigned eleven years before this captivity (2 King. <a id="l30"></a>XXIII. 36. 2 Chron XXXVI. 5) &amp; Iehojakin three months ending with the <a id="l31"></a>captivity. And the 10<sup>th</sup> year of Zedekiah, that is, the 10<sup>th</sup> year of Ieho<a id="l32"></a>jakin's captivity, was the 18<sup>th</sup> year of Nebuchadnezzars reign (Ier. <a id="l33"></a>XXXII. 1) &amp; the 11<sup>th</sup> year of Zedekiah in which Ierusalem was taken, was <a id="l34"></a>the 19<sup>th</sup> of Nebuchadnezzar (Ier. LII. 5, 12) &amp; therefore Nebuchad<a id="l35"></a>nezzar began his reign in Iudea in the year of Nabonassar 142, <a id="l36"></a>that is, two years before the death of his father Nabopolassar, he <a id="l37"></a>being then made king by his father, &amp; Iehojakim succeeded his <a id="l38"></a>father Iosiah in the year of Nabonassar 139, &amp; Ierusalem was <a id="l39"></a>taken &amp; the  Temple burnt in the year of Nabonassar 160, about twenty <a id="l40"></a>years after the destruction of Nineveh.</p>
<p id="par4">The reign of Darius Hystaspis by the Canon &amp; the consent of <a id="l41"></a>all Chronologers, &amp; by several eclipses of the Moons, began in spring <a id="l42"></a>in the year of Nabonassar 227. And <em class="underline">in the fourth year of king <a id="l43"></a>Darius, in the 4<sup>th</sup> day of the ninth month, which is the month Chislen <a id="l44"></a>when the Iews had sent into the house of God–syaing, should I weep in the <a id="l45"></a>fift month as I have done these so many years? the word of the Lord came <a id="l46"></a>to Zechariah, saying, speak to all the people of the land, &amp; lo the Priests saying, <a id="l47"></a>when ye fasted &amp; mourned in the fift &amp; seventh month even those <a id="l48"></a>seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me</em>? Zech. VII. Count backwards <a id="l49"></a>those seventy years in which they fasted in the fift month for the burning <a id="l50"></a>of the Temple, &amp; in the seventh for the death of Gedaliah; &amp; the burn<a id="l51"></a>ing of the Temple &amp; death of Gedaliah will fall upon the fift &amp; <a id="l52"></a>seventh Iewish months in the year of Nabonassar 160 as above.</p>
<p id="par5">As the Chaldean Astronomers counted the reign of their kings by the <a id="l53"></a>years of Nabonassar, beginning with the month <em class="underline">Thoth</em>, so the Iews (as their <a id="l54"></a>authors tell us) counted the reign of theirs by the years of Moses, beginn–<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span>ing every year with the month <em class="underline">Nisan.</em> For if any king commenced his <a id="l55"></a>reign a few days before this month began, it was recconed to him for <a id="l56"></a>a whole year, &amp; the beginning of this month was accounted the beginning <a id="l57"></a>of the second year of his reign.  And according to this recconing the first <a id="l58"></a>year of Iehojakim began with the month Nisam Anno Nabonass. 139, tho <a id="l59"></a>his reign might not really begin till five or six months after; &amp; the <a id="l60"></a>fourth year of Iehojakim &amp; first of Nebuchadnezzar (according to <a id="l61"></a>the recconing of the Iews) began with the month <em class="underline">Nisan</em> Anno Na<a id="l62"></a>bonass. 142; &amp; the first year of Zedekiah &amp; of Iehojakins captivity <a id="l63"></a>&amp; ninth year of Nebuchadnezzar began with the month <em class="underline">Nisan</em> in <a id="l64"></a>the year of Nabonassar 150, &amp; the tenth year of Zedekiah &amp; 18<sup>th</sup> <a id="l65"></a>of Nebuchadnezzar began with the month <em class="underline">Nisan</em> in the year of <a id="l66"></a>Nabonassar 159. Now in the ninth year of Zedekiah, Nebuchad<a id="l67"></a>nezzar invaded Iudea &amp; the cities thereof, &amp; in the tenth month <a id="l68"></a>of that year &amp; tenth day of the month he &amp; his host beseiged <a id="l69"></a>Ierusalem (2 King XXV. 1 Ier XXXIV. 1 &amp; XXXIX. 1 &amp; LII. 4.) From <a id="l70"></a>this time to the tenth month in the second year of Darius are just <a id="l71"></a>seventy years, &amp; accordingly on the 24<sup>th</sup> day of the eleventh <a id="l72"></a>month of this second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came <a id="l73"></a>to Zechariah, &amp; <em class="underline">the Angel of the Lord said</em>, O  Lord of hosts how <a id="l74"></a>long will thou not have mercy on Ierusalem &amp; on the cities of Iudah <a id="l75"></a>against which thou hast had indignation these threescore &amp; ten years, <a id="l76"></a>Zech. 1. 7, 12. So then the ninth year of Zedekiah in which this <a id="l77"></a>Indignation against Ierusalem &amp; the cities of Iudah began com<a id="l78"></a>menced with the month <em class="underline">Nisan</em> in the year of Nabonassar 158; <a id="l79"></a>&amp; the eleventh yeare of Zedekiah &amp; 19<sup>th</sup> of Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l80"></a>in which the city was taken &amp; the Temple burnt, commenced <a id="l81"></a>with the month <em class="underline">Nisan</em> in the year of Nabonassar 160 as above.</p>
<p id="par6">By all these characters the years of Iehojakim Zedekiah <a id="l82"></a>&amp; Nebuchadnezzar seem to be sufficiently determined &amp; there<a id="l83"></a>by the chronology of the Iews in the old Testament is connected <a id="l84"></a>with that of later times. For between the death of Solomon <a id="l85"></a>&amp; the ninth year of Zedekiah wherein Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l86"></a>invaded Iudea &amp; began the siege of Ierusalem, there were <a id="l87"></a>390 years, as is manifest both by the Prophesy of Ezekiel <a id="l88"></a>chap. IV, &amp; by summing up the years of the kings of Iudah; &amp; <a id="l89"></a>from the ninth year of Zedekiah inclusively to the vulgar <a id="l90"></a>Æra of Christ were 590 years: both which numbers, with <a id="l91"></a>half the reign of Solomon, make up a thousand years.</p>
<p id="par7">In the end of the reign of Iosiah, Anno Nabonass. 139, <sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> <a id="l92"></a>Pharaoh Nechoh the successor of Psammiticus came with a <a id="l93"></a>great army out of Egypt against the <em class="underline">king of Assyria</em>, &amp; being <a id="l94"></a>denyed passage through Iudea beat the jews at Megiddo or Magdolus <a id="l95"></a>before Egypt, slew Iosiah their king, marched to Corchemish or <a id="l96"></a>Circutium, a town of Mesopotamia upon Euphrates, &amp; took it, possest <a id="l97"></a>himself of the cities of Syria, sent for Iehoahaz the new king <a id="l98"></a>of Iudah to Riblah or Antioch, deposed him there, made Iehoja<a id="l99"></a>kim king in the room of Iosiah, &amp; put the kingdom of Iudah to <a id="l100"></a>tribute. But the king of Assyria being in the mean time beseiged <a id="l101"></a>&amp; subdued &amp; Nineveh destroyed by Assuerus king of the Medes &amp; <a id="l102"></a>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, &amp; the conquerors being thereby <a id="l103"></a>entitled to the countries of Assyria Mesopotamia &amp; Syria, they led <a id="l104"></a>their victorious forces against the king of Egypt. For Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l105"></a>assisted<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> by Astibares (that is by Assuerus, Achsweres Axeres or Cy–Axeres) king <a id="l110"></a>of the Medes in the<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> third year of Iehojakim, came with a army <a id="l111"></a>of Babylonians Medes Syrians Moabites &amp; Ammonites to the number <a id="l112"></a>of 10000 chariots &amp; 180000 foot &amp; 120000 horse, &amp; laid wast Samaria, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> Galilee, Scythopolis, &amp; the Iews in Galeatis, &amp; besieged Ierusalem, <a id="l113"></a>&amp; took king Iehojakim alive<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup>, &amp; bound him in chains for a time <a id="l115"></a>&amp; carried to Babylon Daniel &amp; others of the people, &amp; part of what <a id="l116"></a>gold &amp; silver &amp; brass they found in the Temple. And in<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> the 4<sup>th</sup> <a id="l117"></a>year of Iehojakim (which was the 20<sup>th</sup> of Nabopolasser) they routed <a id="l118"></a>the army of Pharaoh Nechoh at Carchemish, &amp; by pursuing this <a id="l119"></a>war took from the king of Egypt whatever perteined to him from <a id="l120"></a>the river of Egypt to the river of Euphrates. This king of Egypt<sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>, Be<a id="l122"></a>rosus calls the Satrapa of Egypt &amp; Cælosyria &amp; Phœnicia. And this <a id="l123"></a>victory over him put an end to his reign in Cælosyria &amp; Phœnicia <a id="l124"></a>which he had newly invaded &amp; gave a beginning to the reign of Ne<a id="l125"></a>buchadnezzar there. And by the conquests over Assyria &amp; Syria <a id="l126"></a>the Babylonian Empire was erected.</p>
<p id="par8">Whilst Nebuchadnezzar was acting in Syria<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> his father Na<a id="l129"></a>bopolasser died having reigned 21 years, &amp; Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l130"></a>upon the news thereof having ordered his affairs in Syria return<a id="l131"></a>ed to Babylon leaving the captives &amp; his army with his servants <a id="l132"></a>to follow  him. And from hence forward he applied himself some<a id="l133"></a>times to war, conquering Sitacene, Susiana, Arabia, Edom, Egypt &amp; <a id="l134"></a>some other countries; &amp; sometimes to peace, adorning the Temple <a id="l135"></a>of Belus with the spoiles which he had taken, &amp; the city Babylon with <a id="l136"></a>magnificent walls &amp; gates &amp; stately palaces &amp; pensile gardens, as <a id="l137"></a>Berosus relates, &amp; amongst other things he cut the new rivers <a id="l138"></a>Naarmalcha &amp; Pallacopas above Babylon, &amp; built the city Teredon.</p>
<p id="par9">Iudea was now in servitude under the king of Babylon <a id="l139"></a>being invaded &amp; subdued in the third &amp; fourth years of Ieho<a id="l140"></a>jakim, &amp; Iehojakim served him three years &amp; then turned <a id="l141"></a>&amp; rebelled (2 King. XXIV. 1.)  While Nebuchadnezzar &amp; the – <a id="l142"></a>army of the Chaldeans continued in Syria, Iehojakim was under <a id="l143"></a>compulsion.

<p id="par12">Nergalasser in the name of his young son Laboasserdach the <a id="l178"></a>grandchild of Nebuchadnezzar reigned four years (according to the <a id="l179"></a>Canon &amp; Berosus) including the short reign of Laboasserdach alone. <a id="l180"></a>For Laboasserdach (according to Berosus &amp; Iosephus) reigned nine <a id="l181"></a>months after the death of his father, &amp; then for his evil manners <a id="l182"></a>was slain in a feast by the conspiracy of his friends with Nabonidus <a id="l183"></a>a Babylonian to whom by consent they gave the kingdom: But these <a id="l184"></a>nine months are not recconed apart in the Canon.</p>
<p id="par13">Nabonidus (according to the Canon) began his reign in the year <a id="l185"></a>of Nabonassar 193, reigned seventeen years &amp; ended his reign in the <a id="l186"></a>year of Nabonassar 210, being then vanquished &amp; Babylon taken by <a id="l187"></a>Cyrus.</p>
<p id="par14">Herodotus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup> calls this last king of Babylon Labynitus, &amp; says that <a id="l188"></a>he was the son of a former Labynitus &amp; of Nitocris an eminent <a id="l189"></a>Queen of Babylon. By the father he seems to understand that Laby<a id="l190"></a>nitus who (as he tells us) was king of Babylon when the great Eclips <a id="l191"></a>of the Sun predicted by Thales put an end to the five years war <a id="l192"></a>between the Medes &amp; Lydians, &amp; this was the grat Nebuchadnezzar. <a id="l193"></a>Daniel calls the last king of Babylon Belshazzar, &amp; saith that <sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup> <a id="l194"></a>Nebuchadnezzar was his father. And Iosephus tells us that the last <sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup> <a id="l195"></a>king of Babylon was called Naboandel by the Babylonians, &amp; reigned <a id="l196"></a>seventeen years; &amp; therefore he is the same king with Nabonidus or <a id="l197"></a>Labynitus. And this is more agreable to sacred writ then to make <a id="l198"></a>Nabonidus a stranger to the royal line. For all nations were to <a id="l199"></a>serve Nebuchadnezzar &amp; his posterity till the very time of his – <a id="l200"></a>land should come, &amp; many nations should serve themselves of him <a id="l201"></a>Ier. 27. 7. Belshazzar was born &amp; lived in honour before the fift <sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup> <a id="l202"></a>year of Iehojakims captivity which was the eleventh year of Nebu<a id="l203"></a>chadnezzar's reign; &amp; therefore he was above 34 years old at the <a id="l204"></a>death of Evilmerodach, &amp; so could be no other king then Nabonidus. <a id="l205"></a>For Laboasserdach the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar was a child  under tuition when he reigned. Yet it is not necessary that Belshazzar <a id="l206"></a>should be the immediate son of Nebuchadnezzar. Nitocris might be the <a id="l207"></a>wife of Evilmerodach &amp; Belshazzar their son supposing Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l208"></a>above 25 years old at the taking of Nineveh. And this is consonant <a id="l209"></a>to the Prophesy that all nations should serve Nebuchadnezzar &amp; his <a id="l210"></a>son &amp; his sons son till the time of his land should come Ier. 27.  For <a id="l211"></a> Belshazzar was the only king of Babylon who can be called the son <a id="l212"></a>of the son of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p id="par15">Herodotus tells us that there were two famous Queens of <sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup> Ba<a id="l213"></a>bylon, Semiramis &amp; Nitocris; &amp; that the latter was more skillfull. <a id="l214"></a>She observing that the kingdom of the Medes, having subdued many <a id="l215"></a>cities, &amp; among others Nineveh, was become great &amp; potent, intercepted <a id="l216"></a>&amp; fortified the passages out of Media into Babylonia; &amp; the river <a id="l217"></a>which before was streight she made crooked with great windings that <a id="l218"></a>it might be more sedate &amp; less apt to overflow. And on the south <a id="l219"></a>side of the river above Babylon in imitation of the lake Mœris <a id="l220"></a>she dug a Lake every way forty miles broad to receive the water of <a id="l221"></a>the river &amp; keep it for watering the land. She built also a bridge <a id="l222"></a>over the river in the middle of Babylon, turning the stream into <a id="l223"></a>the Lake till the Bridge was built. Philostratus saith that she made <sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> a Bridge under the river two fathoms broad meaning an arched <a id="l225"></a>vault over which the River flowed &amp; under, which they might walk cross the river. He calls her Μηήδεια a Mede.</p>
<p id="par16">Berosus tells us that Nebuchadnezzar built a pensile garden <a id="l226"></a>upon arches, because his wife was a Mede, &amp; delighted in mountanous <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> prospects, such as abounded in Media but were wanting in Baby<a id="l227"></a>lonia. She was Amyite the daughter of Astyages &amp; sister of Cyaxeres <a id="l228"></a>kings of the Medes. Nebuchadnezzar married her upon a league be<a id="l229"></a>tween their fathers against the king of Assyria. But Nitocris was <a id="l230"></a>another woman who in the reign of her son Labynitus a volup<a id="l231"></a>tuous &amp; vitious king, took care of his affairs, &amp; for securing his – <a id="l232"></a>kingdom against the Medes, did the works above mentioned. This is <a id="l233"></a>that Queen mentioned in Daniel, chap. V. 10.</p>
<p id="par17">Iosephus relates out of the Tyrian records that in the reign <sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> <a id="l236"></a>of Ithobalus king of Tyre, that city was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l237"></a>thirteen years together. In the end of that siege Ithobalus their king <a id="l238"></a>was slain (Ezek. XXVIII. 8, 9, 10) &amp; after him according to the Tyrian <a id="l239"></a>records reigned Baal ten years. Ecribalus &amp; Chelbis one year, Abbarus <a id="l240"></a>three months, Mitgonius &amp; Gerastratus six years, Balatorus one year, <a id="l241"></a>Merbalus four years, &amp; Iromus twenty years; &amp; in the 14<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l242"></a>of Iromus say the Tyrian Records, the reign of Cyrus began in <a id="l243"></a>Babylonia. Therefore the siege of Tyre began 48 years &amp; some <a id="l244"></a>months before the reign of Cyrus in Babylonia. It began <a id="l245"></a>when Ierusalem had been newly taken &amp; burnt with the Temple <a id="l246"></a>(Ezek. 26) &amp; by consequence after the eleventh year of <a id="l247"></a>Iehojakins captivity or 160<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonassar, &amp; therefore <a id="l248"></a>the reign of Cyrus in Babylonia began after the year of Nabo<a id="l249"></a>nassar 208. It ended before the eighth &amp; twentieth year of Ie<a id="l250"></a>hojakin's captivity or 176<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonassar (Ezek. 29. 17) &amp; <a id="l251"></a>therefore the reign of Cyrus in Babylonia began before the <a id="l252"></a>year of Nabonassar 211. By this argument the first year of <a id="l253"></a>Cyrus in Babylonia was one of the two intermediate years, 209, <a id="l254"></a>210. Cyrus invaded Babylonia in the year of Nabonassar 209. <a id="l255"></a>Babylon<sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup>held out, &amp; the next year was taken (Ier 51. 39, 57) <a id="l256"></a>by diverting the river Euphrates, &amp; entring the city through <a id="l257"></a>the emptied channel (Herod. l. 1. Xenophon l. 7) &amp; by consequence <a id="l258"></a>after midsummer. For the river by the melting of the snow <a id="l259"></a>in Armenia, overflows yearly in the beginning of summer, <a id="l260"></a>but in the heat of summer grows low. And that night was <a id="l261"></a>the king of Babylon slain (Xenophon l. 7. Dan. 5. Ioseph. Antiq. <a id="l262"></a>l. 12) &amp; Darius the Mede,  or king of the Medes, took the <a id="l263"></a>kingdom being about threescore &amp; two years old. So then Babylon <a id="l264"></a>was taken a month or two after the summer solstice in the year <a id="l265"></a>of Nabonasser 210, as the Canon also represents, &amp; as has <a id="l266"></a>been otherwise determined above.</p>
<p id="par18">After the taking of Babylon Cyrus went to the king of the <a id="l267"></a>Medes at Ecbatone, &amp; succeeded him in the kingdom (I think by <a id="l268"></a>conquest having beaten him in a battel at Pasaroadæ &amp; reigned over all Media &amp; Persia seven years as <a id="l269"></a>Xenophon relates; but over Babylonia he reigned nine years, <a id="l270"></a>two years under the king of the Medes, &amp; seven years alone; <a id="l271"></a>&amp; in the first year of his reign over the whole Empire he <a id="l272"></a>set the Iews at liberty to return from Babylon to Ierusalem <a id="l273"></a>&amp; rebuild their Temple: For the jews remained in captivity <a id="l274"></a>at Babylon untill the reign of the kingdom of Persia (2 Chron. <a id="l275"></a>XXXVI. 20) &amp; were set at liberty in the first year of the reign <a id="l276"></a>of Cyrus king of Persia over all the kingdoms of the earth <a id="l277"></a>(Ezra I. 1, 2, 3.) Cyrus then reigning at Ecbatane over the Medes, <a id="l278"></a>Ezra VI. 2.</p>
<p id="par19">Now in the first year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign over <a id="l279"></a>Iudea &amp; fourth of Iehojakim's, Ieremiah prophesied that the <a id="l280"></a>land of Iudea &amp; the nations round about, should serve the king <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> of Babylon seventy years, &amp; at the end of seventy years God <a id="l281"></a>would punish the king of Babylon &amp; make the land of the Chal<a id="l282"></a>deans desolate (Ier. XXV. 1, 11, 12) &amp; thereby bring back the Iews <a id="l283"></a>from captivity (Ier. XXIX. 10.)  From the year of Nabonassar <a id="l284"></a>140, which was the second year of Iehojakim in which Nineveh <a id="l285"></a>was destroyed &amp; the Empire of the Assyrians fell &amp; that of Ba<a id="l286"></a>bylon was erected upon its ruins unto the year of Nabonassar <a id="l287"></a>210 in which Babylon was taken by the Medes there were <a id="l288"></a>just 70 years. And from the year of Nabonassar 142 which <a id="l289"></a>was the fourth year of Iehojakim &amp; first of Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l290"></a>in which this Prophesy was given, unto the year of Nabonassar <a id="l291"></a>212 which was the first year of Cyrus which the Iews <a id="l292"></a>returned from captivity, there were also just 70 years. For there was a seventy years which  <a id="l293"></a>ended with the fall of Babylon (Ier XXV. 11, 12, 13, 14) &amp; another <a id="l294"></a>seventy years which lasted till the reign of the kingdom <a id="l295"></a>of Persia &amp; ended with the return of the captivity in <a id="l296"></a>the first year of Cyrus king of Persia (Ier XXIX. 10 &amp; 2 Chron. <a id="l297"></a>XXXVI. 20, 21, 22, 23.) Also the fulfilling of the first seventy <a id="l298"></a>years might enable Daniel in the first year of Darius <a id="l299"></a>to understand by books the number of the years whereof <a id="l300"></a>the word of the Lord came to Ieremiah the Prophet that <a id="l301"></a>he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of <a id="l302"></a>Ierusalem (Dan. IX. 2) which desolations began with the first<a id="l303"></a>year of Nebuchadnezzar &amp; ended with the captivity in <a id="l304"></a>the first of Cyrus.</p>
<p id="par20">Some date the seventy years from the captivity of Iehojakim, <a id="l305"></a>others from that of Zedekiah; but they are plainly the duration <a id="l306"></a>of the dominion of the kingdom of Babylon over the nations &amp; ended <a id="l307"></a>with the fall thereof, 2 Chron. XXXVI. 21, 22 Ier. XXV. 1 12. Yet the ancient <a id="l308"></a>Iews counted also a seventy years from the beginning of the war <a id="l309"></a>in the 9<sup>th</sup> year of Zedekiah to the building of the second Temple <a id="l310"></a>in the second year of Darius Hystaspis (Zech. 1. 12) &amp; another seventy <a id="l311"></a>years from the taking of Ierusalem &amp; burning of the Temple in <a id="l312"></a>the 11<sup>th</sup> year of Zedekiah to the fourth year of the same Darius <a id="l313"></a>(Zech. VII. 5.) In these seventy years the Iews fasted in the fift <a id="l314"></a>month on account of the conflagration of the Temple in that month. <a id="l315"></a>And when they had fasted seventy years they sent to the house of the <a id="l316"></a>Lord to enquire of the Priests &amp; Prophets whether they should continue <a id="l317"></a>that fast any longer. This message was in the fourth year of Darius <a id="l318"></a>in the ninth month, (in the end of the year of Nabonassar 230,) <a id="l319"></a>&amp; therefore the last fast of the seventy was in the fifth month <a id="l320"></a>of the same year: which month was just seventy years after the <a id="l321"></a>conflagration of the Temple was we noted above.</p>
<p id="par21">Now it is very remarkable that this Prophesy was the cause of <a id="l322"></a>its own fulfilling. Isaiah two hundred years before, called Cyrus <a id="l323"></a>by name, &amp; prophesied that God said of him; Cyrus is my shepherd, he <a id="l324"></a>shall perform all my pleasure, even saying to Ierusalem, Thou shalt <a id="l325"></a>be built, &amp; to the Temple, Thy foundation shall be laid &amp;c. Isa. XLIV. <a id="l326"></a>28. And Ieremy predicted the time when Cyrus should conquer <a id="l327"></a>Babylon &amp; do this. And these prophesies being made known to Cyrus, <a id="l328"></a>so soon as he was freed from subjection to Darius &amp; succeeded him <a id="l329"></a>in the throne, he put forth a Proclamation throughout all his king<a id="l330"></a>dom in writing, saying, <em class="underline">Thou saith Cyrus king of Persia, The Lord <a id="l331"></a>God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth, &amp; he <a id="l332"></a>hath charged me to build him an house at Ierusalem which is <a id="l333"></a>in Iudah. Who is there among you of all his people, his God be <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> with him &amp; let him go up to Ierusalem which is in Iudah, &amp; build <a id="l334"></a>the house of the Lord God of Israel (he is the God) which is in Ierusa<a id="l335"></a>lem.</em> Ezra. I. And this Proclamation being laid up among the Records <a id="l336"></a>in the Palace at Ecbatane in Media, was issued from thence by Cyrus <a id="l337"></a>reigning there after the conquest &amp; deposing of Darius.</p>
<p id="par22">The extent of the Babylonian Empire was much the same with <a id="l338"></a>that of Nineveh after the revolt of the Medes. Berosus saith that <a id="l339"></a>Nebuchadnezzar held Egypt, Syria, Phœnicia &amp; Arabia; &amp; Strabo adds <a id="l340"></a>Arbela to the territories of Babylon; &amp; saying that Babylon was an<a id="l341"></a>ciently the metropolis of Assyria, he thus describes the limits of the <a id="l342"></a>Assyrian Empire. <em class="underline">Contiguous</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">to Persia &amp; Susiana are <a id="l343"></a>the Assyrians. For so they call Babylonia &amp; the greatest part of <a id="l344"></a>the region about it: part of which is Assyria</em> (wherein is Nineveh) <a id="l345"></a><em class="underline">&amp; Apolloniatis &amp; Chalonetis by the mountain Zagrus, &amp; the fields <a id="l346"></a>neare Nineveh, &amp; Dolomena, &amp; Chalachena, Chazena, Adiabena, <a id="l347"></a>&amp; the nations of Mesopotamia neare the Gordieans &amp; Mygdoues <a id="l348"></a>about Nisibis unto Zeugma upon Euphrates, &amp; a large region on <a id="l349"></a>this side Euphrates inhabited by the Arabians &amp; Syrians properly <a id="l350"></a>so called as far as Cilicia &amp; Phœnicia &amp; Libya &amp; the sea of <a id="l351"></a>Egypt &amp; the sinus Issicus.</em> And a little after, describing the extent <a id="l352"></a>of the Babylonian region, he bounds it on the north with the <a id="l353"></a>Armenians &amp; Medes unto the mountain Zagrus, on the east side <a id="l354"></a>with Susa Elymais &amp; Paretica (inclusively,) on the south with <a id="l355"></a>the Persian Gulph &amp; Chaldea, &amp; on the west with the Arabes <a id="l356"></a>Scenitæ as far as Adiabena &amp; Gordiœa. Afterwards speaking of <a id="l357"></a>Susiana &amp; Sitacene a region between Babylon &amp; Susa, &amp; of Paratica <a id="l358"></a>&amp; Cossea &amp; Elymais &amp; of Gabiana &amp; Massabatica &amp; Corbiana Pro<a id="l359"></a>vinces of Elymais, &amp; of the Sagapens &amp; Silocenes, two little adjoin<a id="l360"></a>ing Provinces, he concludes. <em class="underline">And these are the nations which inhabity <a id="l361"></a>Babylonia eastward. To the north are Media &amp; Armenia</em> [exclusively] <a id="l362"></a><em class="underline">&amp; westward are Adiabene &amp; Mesopotamia</em> [inclusively.] <em class="underline">The greatest <a id="l363"></a>part of Adiabene is plane, the same being a part of Babylonia. <a id="l364"></a>In some places it borders on Armenia. For the Medes Armenians <a id="l365"></a>&amp; Babylonians warred frequently on one another.</em> Thus far Strabo.</p>
<p id="par23">When Cyrus took Babylon, he changed the kingdom into a Satrapy <a id="l366"></a>or Province: whereby the bounds were long after known. And by this <a id="l367"></a>means Herodotus gives us an estimate of the  bigness of this <sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup> Monar<a id="l368"></a>chy in proportion to that of the Medo–Persian, telling us that <a id="l369"></a>whilst every region over which the king of Persia reign<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> is <a id="l370"></a>distributed for the nourishment of his army besides the tributes, <a id="l371"></a>the Babylonian region nourishes him four months of the twelve <a id="l372"></a>in the year, &amp; all the rest of Asia eight. So the power of this <a id="l373"></a>region is equivalent to the third part of Asia, &amp; its Principality <a id="l374"></a>(which the Persians call a Satrapy) is far the best of all the Pro<a id="l375"></a>vinces. To this estimate of Herodotus may be added Egypt. For <a id="l376"></a>after the siege &amp; taking of Tyre, Nebuchadnezzar invaded &amp; with <a id="l377"></a>a great slaughter conquered &amp; captivated Egypt, (Ezek XXIX. 18, 29. <a id="l378"></a>&amp; Chap. XXX. 31, 32. &amp; Ier. XLIII.)  &amp; the Egyptians slew Pharaoh <a id="l379"></a>Hophra or Vaphres the successor of Psammis the successor of Nechaoh <a id="l380"></a>(Ezek. XXXI. 18 &amp; XXXII. 31, 32, &amp; Ier. XLIV. 30 &amp; XLVI. 25, 26) after <a id="l381"></a>whom reigned Amasis who served the king of Babylon 40 years <a id="l382"></a>(Ezek. XXIX. 11, 13) that is, till the death of Cyrus; &amp; then revolting <a id="l383"></a>reigned four years more. After which Egypt was subdued by Cam<a id="l384"></a>bysos, &amp; hath almost ever since remained in servitude.</p>
<p id="par24">Babylon was a square city of 120 furlongs or 15 miles on <sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup> <a id="l385"></a>every side, compassed first with a broad &amp; deep ditch, &amp; then with a <a id="l386"></a>wall fifty cubits thick &amp; two hundred high.

He was recconed the progenitor of Nebuchadnezzar, <a id="l396"></a>&amp; might be Pul the founder of the Assyrian Empire, or one of his sons the husband of Semiramis or perhaps <a id="l397"></a>Sesac. For Babylon is sometimes called Sesac (Ier. XXV. 26 &amp; LI. <a id="l398"></a>41.) &amp; the Belus of the  Chaldeans was the Bacchus of the <a id="l399"></a>Arabians, that is Osiris. [] This practis of observing the stars began in Egypt <a id="l407"></a>in the days of Ammon as above &amp; was propagated from thence <a id="l408"></a>in the reign of Sesac into Afric Europe &amp; Asia by conquest; <a id="l409"></a>&amp; then Atlas formed the sphere of the Libyans &amp; Chiron that <a id="l410"></a>of the Greeks, &amp; the Chaldeans also made a sphere of their <a id="l411"></a>own. But Astrology was invented in Egypt by Nechepsos one <a id="l412"></a>of the kings of the lower Egypt &amp; Petosiris his Priest a little <a id="l413"></a>before the days of Sabacon ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 7v &gt; </span>✝ &amp; propagated thence into Chaldea where Zoroaster the legislator of the <a id="l414"></a>Magi  met with it.

And at that time or <a id="l427"></a>not long before, the king of Babylon might erect the Temple of Iu<a id="l428"></a>piter Belus in the form of the Egyptian Pyramids. For this Temple <a id="l429"></a>was a solid Tower or Pyramid a furlong square &amp; a furlong <sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup> <a id="l430"></a>high,  with seven retractions which made <a id="l431"></a>it appear like eight towers standing upon one another.

And above the Temple was <a id="l435"></a>a place for observing the starrs. They went up to the top of it <a id="l436"></a>by steps on the out side. And the bottom was compassed with a Court <a id="l437"></a>&amp; the Court with a building two furlongs in length on every side.</p>
<p id="par25">The Babylonians were extremely addicted Sorcery, In<a id="l438"></a>chantments, Astrology &amp; Divinations (Ier. I. 2, 40) &amp; to feasting wine <a id="l439"></a>&amp; weomen. <em class="underline">Nihil urbis ejus corruptius moribus, nec ad irritandas <a id="l440"></a>inliciendasqs immodicas voluptates instructius.

Curtius lib. V. cap. 1. And this leudness <a id="l449"></a>of their weomen coloured over with the name of civility was encouraged even by their religion. For it was the <a id="l450"></a>custome for their weomen once in their life to sit in the Temple of <sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup> <a id="l453"></a>Venus for the use of strangers: which Temple they called Succoth <a id="l454"></a>Benoth, the Temple of weomen. And when any woman was once sat <a id="l455"></a>there, she was not to depart till some stranger threw money into <a id="l456"></a>her bosom, took her away &amp; lay with her. And the money being for <a id="l457"></a>sacred uses, she was obliged to accept of it how little so ever &amp; follow <a id="l458"></a>the stranger. This leudness voluptuousness sorcery &amp; idolatry is alluded <a id="l459"></a>unto in the description of the great whore of Babylon (Apoc. XVII, XVIII) <a id="l460"></a>&amp; so are the rivers of Babylonia &amp; the great deserts between Iudea <a id="l461"></a>&amp; Babylon.</p>
<p id="par26">The Iews in their return from the Babylonian captivity brought <a id="l462"></a>back with them the names of the Chaldean months, not those of the months <a id="l463"></a>of the solar year of Nabonassar, but those of the ancient Lunisolar <a id="l464"></a>year of the Chaldees. And so also the Samaritans, when they were <a id="l465"></a>transplanted by Salmanasser, brought with them into Samaria the <a id="l466"></a>year &amp; Æra of the Assyrians. This year was Lunisolar, &amp; the <a id="l467"></a>Assyrian names of the months used by the Samaritans, were the <a id="l468"></a>same with the Chaldean  names used by the Iews: so that <a id="l469"></a>the Assyrian year seems to have spread with their Empire. <a id="l470"></a>Scaliger informs us that the Samaritans still use the Epocha of <a id="l471"></a>these years, &amp; that some of them suppose it to be the Epocha or <a id="l472"></a>Æra of Salmanasser, others the Æra of the desolation &amp; captivity <a id="l473"></a>of Samaria. It began (according to Scalinger) four entire years <a id="l474"></a>before the Olympiads, &amp; therefore was the Æra of Pul, the <a id="l475"></a>founder of the Assyrian Empire. As the Babylonians had the <a id="l476"></a>Æra of Nabonassar their  first <a id="l477"></a>king upon record, so the Assyrians might have the Æra of the <a id="l478"></a>first king of Assyria. For Pul reigned &amp; made war in the beginning <a id="l479"></a>of this Æra. For in the ninth eyar of this Æra Menahen king <a id="l480"></a>of Israel began to reign, &amp; in or near the beginning of his reign <a id="l481"></a>destroyed Thapsach, a town upon Euphrates, for not opening to him; <a id="l482"></a>&amp; thereupon Pul, having extended his conquests into Mesopotamia <a id="l483"></a>before, came against Israel, &amp; Menahen gave him a thousand <a id="l484"></a>Talents to desist &amp; confirm the kingdom to him. From the be<a id="l485"></a>ginning of this Æra of the Assyrians their Monarchy stood 173 years <a id="l486"></a>to the destruction of Ninaveh &amp; 70 years more to the fall of <a id="l487"></a>Babylon.</p>
<p id="par27">The Temple of Solomon being destroyed by the Babylonians, <a id="l488"></a>it may not be amiss here to give a description of that edifice.</p>
<p id="par28">This Temple looked eastward, &amp; stood in a square area <sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup> <a id="l489"></a>called the Separate place, &amp; before it stood the Altar in the <sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> <a id="l490"></a>center of another square area called the inner Court or Court <a id="l491"></a>of the Priests; &amp; these two square areas, being parted only <a id="l492"></a>by a marble rail, made an area 200 cubits long from west <a id="l493"></a>to east &amp; 100 cubits broad. This area was compassed on the <a id="l494"></a>west with a wall &amp; on the other three sides with a pavement <sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> <a id="l495"></a>fifty cubits broad upon which stood the buildings for the Priests with <a id="l496"></a>cloisters on the outside. And the pavement &amp; buildings upon it were <a id="l497"></a>encompassed on the outside with a marble rail before the cloysters. <a id="l498"></a>The whole made an area 250 cubits long from west to east &amp; <a id="l499"></a>200 broad, &amp; was compassed with the outward court called also the <a id="l500"></a>great court or court of the people, which was an hundred <a id="l501"></a>cubits broad on every side. For there were but two courts <a id="l502"></a>built by Solomon.</p>
