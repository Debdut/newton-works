<p id="par10" class="i0">In the year 524 the Greek Emperor Iustin put out an edicte that <a id="l47"></a>the churches of the Arians should be every consecrated to the catholic <a id="l48"></a>religion. Whereupon Theodericus the Gothic king of  Italy sent Pope Iohn I with some of the senators <a id="l49"></a>to the Emperor to    tell him that unless he restored the  Churches <a id="l50"></a>to  their owners, he would treat the catholicks in Italy in the same <a id="l51"></a>manner. The Pope going the next year upon this embassy was <a id="l52"></a>received very honorably by the Emperor &amp; received great presents <a id="l53"></a>from <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>him<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; instead of perswading the Emperor to restore the churches <a id="l54"></a>conspired with him &amp; consecrated as many of them as he could to <a id="l55"></a>the use of the catholicks, &amp; upon his return to Italy was impri<a id="l56"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>soned<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> for it   by Theodericus &amp; wrote from prison to the bishops of <a id="l57"></a>Italy, to arm themselves with the sword of the Spirit against the Arian religion for extirpating it &amp; to consecrate all the churches of the Arians  wherever they could <a id="l58"></a>find them for the use of the Catholicks, as he had done at Constantinople. Whence it  is apparent that he acted in confederacy with the Greek Emperor against <a id="l60"></a>the Gothic king of  Italy.  Iusti<a id="l61"></a>nian succeded Iustin &amp; in the year 532 or 533  designing to make war upon the Vandals sent to <a id="l62"></a>Pope Iohn II  great presents with an Epistle conteining a pro<a id="l63"></a>fession of his faith, to be approved by him &amp; &amp;   represented therein that he had always a desire to keep <a id="l64"></a>the unity of the Apostolic seat, &amp; therefore made hast to subject &amp; unite all the Priests <a id="l65"></a>of the whole eastern territory  to the seat of his Holiness, – which <a id="l66"></a>was the Head of all the Churches. This   he did to engage the Church of Rome  in his party during the wars against those of another religion. When he had conquered the Vandals he began a war <a id="l70"></a>upon the Goths &amp; thereupon Theodahatus king of the Goths A. C. 535 sent Pope Aga<a id="l71"></a>petus  upon an embassy  to Iustinian for <a id="l72"></a>putting a stop to the war. Agapetus went very unwillingly, was <a id="l73"></a>received splendidly by the Emperor, &amp; against the mind of the Emperor &amp; Empress deposed Anthimius Patriarch <a id="l74"></a>of Constantinople &amp; substituted Mennas   into that bishopric, <a id="l75"></a>[&amp; soon after died.] Whence it is manifest that the Emperor for <a id="l76"></a>keeping the Church of Rome in his interest against the Goths, still suffered the <a id="l77"></a>Bishop of Rome to act in the east as universal bishop. The next year <a id="l78"></a>A. C. 536 Bellisarius, having taken Sicily from the Goths sailed into Italy &amp; <a id="l79"></a>landing at Regium   all the people in  the villages  <a id="l80"></a>out of hatred to the Goths immediately came over to him. Thence he <a id="l81"></a>marched to Naples &amp; the Neopolitans were at first inclined to surren<a id="l82"></a>der, but  the City being garrisoned by Goths held out a siege <a id="l83"></a>of  twenty days. Thence he marched to Rome,  the Romans  by the <a id="l84"></a>perswasion  of Pope Silverius  inviting him <a id="l85"></a>&amp; promising to surrender their city so soon as he came near it. <a id="l86"></a>This  was done in December A.

The Franks also seized part of the Gothic territories. And   <a id="l97"></a>now  the Pope, having by the assistance of his allies  subdued one kingdom which  had reigned <a id="l98"></a>over him &amp; hindred his rise,  deserved by this conquest &amp; the aquisition of the universal <a id="l99"></a>bishopric over the Greek Churches,  to weare the Crown which  had <a id="l100"></a>been lately conveyed to him  from the Emperor by the Franks, they <a id="l101"></a>helping him as well to the conquest as to the crown.

And its further observa<a id="l151"></a>ble that the reliques of these 40 martyrs which are here said to be sent into many <a id="l152"></a>regions &amp; to adorn many countries, were sent  from Antioch to those places  <a id="l153"></a>before the year 373. For Athanasius who died that year had also an oration <a id="l154"></a>upon them. This Oration is not yet published, but Gerrard Vossius saw it in MS <a id="l155"></a>in the  library of Cardinal Ascanius in Italy, as he mentions <a id="l156"></a>in his commentary upon the Oration of Ephræm Syrus on the same 40 mar<a id="l157"></a>tyrs.  And since Alexandria sent the reliques of the martyrs of Egypt in <a id="l158"></a>to all  parts of the earth   thereby acquiring <a id="l159"></a>glory to their city  &amp; declaring her the Metropolis of the whole earth, as you <a id="l160"></a>have heard out of Chrysostom: it may be concluded that before she received <a id="l161"></a>the reliques of the 40 martyrs from Antioch &amp; began to celebrate their anniversary  festival she began to send out the relique <a id="l162"></a>of her own martyrs into all parts,  that their anniversary days might be every where celebrated. This practice therefore began some  considerable time before the death of Atha<a id="l163"></a>nasius; &amp;  by consequence by his approbation &amp; encouragement.   In <sup class="note" id="ed2-ref">[Editorial&nbsp;Note&nbsp;2]</sup> his younger days  he had been a Monck attending upon Antony, as he <a id="l165"></a>himself  acknowledges in the beginning of the life of Antony written by himself, &amp; all the Moncks <a id="l166"></a>were entirely at his devotion &amp;  unanimously progagated <a id="l167"></a> this superstition into all the world , pretending to find <a id="l168"></a>out the bodies of the martyrs by dreams,  running up &amp; down all the <a id="l169"></a>empire with their reliques &amp; erecting altars over the graves for worshipping them <a id="l170"></a>untill these shamefull practices were checkt by publick laws as you have heard <a id="l171"></a>above.</p>
<p id="par19">The year in which these practises began is difficult to assigne.

For  in the end of the life  of Antony Athana<a id="l173"></a>sius relates that these  were his dying words to  his disciples who <a id="l174"></a>stood about him. <em class="underline">Do you take care to adhere  to Christ in the first place &amp; <a id="l175"></a>then to the saints, that after death they may receive you as friends &amp; acquain<a id="l176"></a>tance unto the eternal tabernacles.

These ecclesi<a id="l272"></a>astical feuds &amp; calamities – – – – appetuntur. So Sidonius Appollinaris a writer of the same age ascribes the sinking of <a id="l273"></a>the Western Empire – – – oppress the people. And Ammianus Marcellinus  a faithful historian contempo<a id="l274"></a>rary to Gregory Nazianzen, gives us a signal instance of the  factious &amp; violent spirit of the Christians <a id="l275"></a>of Rome. Damasus &amp; Vrsicinus, saith he, supra – – – – regales superent mensas.  This was <a id="l276"></a>the state of the Roman Church when Damasus was  made Bishop of Rome which was in the year of <a id="l277"></a>Christ  367   And the Church of Rome <a id="l278"></a>being thus given up to pomp &amp; luxury,  &amp; faction &amp; arrived at this state of magnificence, tis not <a id="l279"></a>to be wondered   that the most  ambitious men   prest most into this bishopric &amp; then studied nothing so much as under a shew of religion <a id="l281"></a>to encrease their power &amp; honour &amp; wealth. For this end they  supported a Schism in Afric against the  main body of the African Church who by their rejecting the <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the bottom of the page &gt; </span>the baptism of hereticks, are manifested to be the genuine  successors of Cyprians Church. <a id="l282"></a>For this end they claimed appeals from all the world<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 5r resumes &gt; </span> [For this was the true reason of the Bishop of <a id="l283"></a>Rome's beginning to claim appeales from all the world  presently after the death of Constantine the great <a id="l284"></a>&amp; of the western Bishops supporting him in this claim].     This made Basil  <a id="l285"></a> complain of the Western superciliousness &amp; say he hated the hautiness of that Church:  <a id="l286"></a> This made Socrates  write that the Bishops of Rome &amp; Alexandria had of old (that is long before the Papacy <a id="l287"></a>of Cælestine of whom he was speaking) transgressed the bounds of the Priesthod &amp; degenerated into ex<a id="l288"></a>ternal dominion:  The corruption was  universall &amp; therefore the Luciferans   asserted that the whole world was become the Devils &amp; the <a id="l289"></a>Church was turned into a  bawdy house.   &amp; others complained that <a id="l290"></a>the corruptions of the Christians were the occasion of the fall of the Western Empire,  &amp; that for 5 Luxury, 6 drunkenness,  keeping of  concubines adultery, 8 Sodomy, 13 murders,  9 injustice, 11 oppression, 12 rapine, 3 voluptuousness, <a id="l292"></a>14 common swearing,  15 faction backbiting 4 frequenting of Theaters &amp; publick shows, 10 bribery, 1 pride, 2 am<a id="l293"></a>bition, &amp; all manner of impiety &amp; immorality the Roman Catholicks in the fift century &amp; end of the <a id="l294"></a>fourth outdid all mankind.

<p id="par33">Nor was it the  crime of a few, the corruption was generall &amp; early. The western Bishops in the Council of Sardica A.

And as he was unqualified so the Bishops of  Rome &amp; Italy had no authority to impose him upon them They had no more authority <a id="l338"></a>  over the churches of Afric  then the Bishops of Afric had  over those of Italy.   And the consequence was to claim in the next place appeals from all the world, &amp; by these   to set the whole <a id="l343"></a>world in flames.

<p id="par49" class="i0">Gregory Nazianzen in his first Oration  against the Emperor Iulian <a id="l454"></a> expostulates thus with Constantius for making him Emperor. What happened to you, most divine <a id="l455"></a>&amp; Christ-loving Emperor (for I am carried on to expostulate with you as <a id="l456"></a>if you were present &amp; heard me, altho I know that you are much <a id="l457"></a>more excellent then that you should  deserve to be reprehended by <a id="l458"></a>me, For you are joyned to God &amp; have received an inheritance of <a id="l459"></a>heavenly glory &amp; are so far gone from us as to  change your <a id="l460"></a> kingdom for  a better.) What counsel is this that you have <a id="l461"></a>taken who have far transcended in skilfulness of mind &amp; sharpness <a id="l462"></a>of wit  all the Emperors not only of your own but also of <a id="l463"></a>former memory. Who   hast driven out the barbarous nations round about <a id="l464"></a>&amp; partly by speeches partly by arms subdued intestine tyrants to your dominion, &amp; both so dexterously &amp; notably <a id="l465"></a>as if neither gave you any trouble. — And a little after excusing <a id="l466"></a>Constantius for electing Iulian Emperor he thus goes on. When I have <a id="l467"></a>named his benignity I have made his apology. For who  knows not (even among <a id="l468"></a>those who knew him but moderately) that for the sake of piety &amp; the love <a id="l469"></a>of us &amp; desire to do us all good, he would not only neglect the honour <a id="l470"></a>of his  whole family &amp; the increase of his  Empire but also he would <a id="l471"></a>willingly prefer our safety &amp; prosperity to his  empire it self &amp; to all <a id="l472"></a>his fortunes &amp; even to his own life then which nothing is more dear to any man <a id="l473"></a>For never was any man taken with so eager a desire of any thing <a id="l474"></a>as he was that the Christians should increase &amp; come to the height of <a id="l475"></a>glory &amp; power. And neither the conquered nations nor the good laws <a id="l476"></a>constitution &amp; government of the Empire, nor to be &amp; to be called king of kings, nor any <a id="l477"></a>thing else in which the happiness of men is placed nor any thing whatsoever rejoiced him <a id="l478"></a>so much as that we by him &amp; he by us might flourish  with God &amp; <a id="l479"></a>men &amp; enjoy a firm &amp; stable power to all ages. — Who if he gave <a id="l480"></a>us any trouble, he did it not owt of contempt of us, nor to reproach us, nor to <a id="l481"></a> favour others before us, but that we might all unite &amp; become of one <a id="l482"></a>mind &amp; not be divided &amp; separated by schisms. Thus far Gregory tho an <a id="l483"></a>enemy to this Emperor in point of religion. It was with this designe therefore that <a id="l484"></a>Constantius supprest the   proceedings of the Bishop of Rome &amp; his adherents for gaining the universal Bishopric <a id="l485"></a>&amp; caused the western clergy to  acknowledge the independent &amp; supreme authority of the eastern Councils <a id="l486"></a>in judicial matters over her own members, &amp; banished those who refused to acknowledg it as <a id="l487"></a> disturbers of the peace of the Chur<a id="l488"></a>ch of Christ  It was therefore out of love to the Christian religion &amp; with a designe to  put a stop to the growing <a id="l489"></a>schisms &amp; to  restore the peace of the churches &amp; reduce  them to  <a id="l490"></a>a flourishing condition, that  Constantius supprest the proceedings of the <a id="l491"></a>Bishop of Rome &amp; his adherents for compassing the universal bishopric &amp; <a id="l492"></a>caused the western Clergy. And that he acted out of  affection to the Christian religion <a id="l493"></a> is further manifest from the mischief which he did to the religion of the heathen <a id="l494"></a>For Libanius the Orator a heathen thus complains of him: It is Constantiu<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l495"></a>&amp; his reign which having received the sparks of the wil from his father <a id="l496"></a>carried on the work to a great fire. For he spoiled the Gods of their  <a id="l497"></a>wealth but this Emperor threw down their Temples to the grownd, &amp; <a id="l498"></a>abrogating all the sacred laws gave himself to whom we know.</p>
<p id="par50">The controversy about the universal bishopric being thus composed &amp; the <a id="l499"></a> &amp; the peace &amp; discipline of the Church catholick restored: things continued in this state till the year <a id="l500"></a>357, &amp; then a new controversy brake out between the eastern &amp; western <a id="l501"></a>churches about  the language of the sons <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>being<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>, μιᾶς οὐσίας &amp; μίας ὑποστάσεως <a id="l502"></a><em class="underline">of one usia &amp; one hypostasis</em> with the father. For this  not being <a id="l503"></a>the language of the Council of Nice but  tending to Montanism <a id="l504"></a>&amp; Sabellianism: the Greeks for putting a stop to the growth of those errors thought it necessary to abrogate it.

For, saith Greg. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007v"> &lt;7v&gt; </span> Nazianzen, if you except a very few who either by reason of the obscurity <a id="l511"></a>of their name were sleighted, or by their vertue resisted (who were <a id="l512"></a>requite to be left to Israel as a seed &amp; root that  by the influences of <a id="l513"></a>the Spirit she might flourish again &amp; be restored to life) all complied with <a id="l514"></a>the time. This was the only difference between them that some fell <a id="l515"></a>into that fraud sooner &amp; others later, &amp; some  were captains <a id="l516"></a>&amp; leaders in the impiety &amp; others were placed in the second order: being <a id="l517"></a>either struck with fear or overcome with gain &amp; advantage or ensnared <a id="l518"></a>with flatteries or lastly circumvented by ignorance, which is the least of the <a id="l519"></a>offences.

<p id="par51">This was the state of things in the end of the reign of Constantius. And in <a id="l520"></a>this state the Church continued till the reign of Iovian excepting the persecution that she <a id="l521"></a>suffered in the reign of Iulian the apostate.

For all schismaticks being enemies <a id="l589"></a>to the Church, the  Apostle Iohn &amp; the primitive Christians called them Antichrists that is enemies to Christ <a id="l590"></a> especially if they erred in their <a id="l591"></a>opinions or practises with relation to God or Christ:  &amp; by the great Antichrist they <a id="l592"></a>understood nothing else then  a general  heresy which by its plausible appearance <a id="l593"></a>should deceive &amp; draw away the greatest part of Christians  &amp; make a separation so great as by its numbers to over<a id="l594"></a>come the true Church of God. For Cyprian Bishop of Carthage speaking of the baptism of such <a id="l595"></a>hereticks as had not yet been baptised into the true Church; saith, <em class="underline">Hæreticos <a id="l596"></a>secundum Evangelicam &amp; Apostolicam constitutionem adversarios Christi <a id="l597"></a>Antichristos appellatos, quando ad Ecclesiam venerint, unico Ecclesiæ <a id="l598"></a>baptismate baptisandos esse ut possint fieri de adversarijs amici et de Anti<a id="l599"></a>christis Christiani</em>.

Cavenda sunt autem non solum – – – – – – – – make them err &amp; fall <a id="l602"></a>away &amp; under the name of Christians become the great Antichrist.

And hence came the <a id="l725"></a>custome of translating the bodies of the saints &amp; martyrs into  the  Churches which were new <a id="l726"></a>built after this Persecution [of which there are divers instances in the reign of Constantius] <a id="l727"></a> &amp; of dedicating these new Churches to the saints buried in them: all which gave occasion to <a id="l728"></a>the Emperor Iulian (as Cyrill relates) to accuse the Christians in this manner. <em class="underline">You have filled <a id="l729"></a>all places</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">with sepulchres &amp; monuments although you are no where <a id="l730"></a>bidden to prostrate your selves to sepulchres &amp; to respect them officiously</em>.

In Egypt this superstition towards the dead seems to have advanced faster <a id="l737"></a>then in other places. For Antony the Monk who died in the year 358, <a id="l738"></a>complained that it was then grown customary among the Egyptians <a id="l739"></a> – – – – – – private families. <sup class="note" id="ed5-ref">[Editorial&nbsp;Note&nbsp;5]</sup>   You have heard above <a id="l740"></a>how some Christians went to the Cœmeteries for the advantag of devotion &amp; health presently after <a id="l741"></a>Dioclesian's persecution, &amp; it seems this opinion workt among Christians <a id="l742"></a>till it gained a general belief &amp; made a very great noise. For <a id="l743"></a>Hilary in his book against Constantius written in the fift year <a id="l744"></a>of his banishment A.

And adds this reason for the institution. <em class="underline">When <a id="l759"></a>he observed that the simple &amp; unskilfull multitude, by reason of corporal <a id="l760"></a>delights remained in the error of idols; that the principal thing might <a id="l761"></a>be corrected among them, namely that instead of their vain worship &amp; <a id="l762"></a>superstition they might turn their eys upon God: he permitted  <a id="l763"></a>that at the memories of the holy Martyrs they might make merry &amp;</em> <a id="l764"></a><em class="doubleunderline">delight themselves &amp; be resolved into joy</em>.  In the same  persecution of Decius Cyprian     ordered the  passions of the Martyrs in Afric to be registered in order to celebrate their memoirs annually with oblations &amp; sacrifices And Felix Bishop of Rome a little after, as Platina relates  <em class="underline">Martyrum gloriæ consulens constituit ut quotannis <a id="l767"></a>sacrificia eorum nomine celebrarentur</em>.

<p id="par71">[Rome being the Metropolis of the Roman Empire, the Bishop of this <a id="l826"></a>city  attempted very early to act with an authority above that of other bishops <a id="l827"></a>&amp; to oppose the proceedings of other Bishops for extending her jurisdiction over them &amp; were therein favoured by the Emperors So in the days of Tertullian when the Churches of Asia had excommunicated the <a id="l828"></a>Cataphrygians, he   wrote Letters of peace to those hereticks &amp; excommunicated the Churches of Asia for  solemnizing the resurrection on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of the Month Nisan. In the days of Cyprian Pope <a id="l829"></a> Stephen excommunicated the churches of Afric &amp; Asia as if they had been under <a id="l830"></a>his jurisdiction.  The Popes Melchiades &amp; Silvester supported  Cæcilian against <a id="l831"></a>the sentence of a Council of the African Churches &amp; thereby subverted the ancient Church of Afric which rejected the Baptism of hereticks &amp; set upon a party which favoured it. Pope Iulius the successor <a id="l832"></a>of Silvester A. C. 441 received the appeals of Athanasius  Paul Marcellus &amp; <a id="l833"></a>Asclepas from the Councils of the Greeks, absolved them from the sentences of those <a id="l834"></a>Councils &amp; summoned the Greeks to appear before them in a Council at Rome  the next year <a id="l835"></a> &amp; give an account of their proceedings,  &amp; the western part of the Council of Serdica A.
