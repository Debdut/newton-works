<p id="par1">The whole earth was by the first inhabitants <a id="l2"></a>divided into  many coordinate governments according <a id="l3"></a>to the number of families. For when Moses had <a id="l4"></a>recconed up the posterity of Noah to the fourth generation <a id="l5"></a>he adds: <em class="underline">These are the families of the sons of Noah <a id="l6"></a>after their generations in their nations &amp; by these were <a id="l7"></a>the nations divided after the flood</em>. Which is as much <a id="l8"></a>as to say, that as Noach divided the whole earth between <a id="l9"></a>his three sons, &amp; gave Europe to Iaphet, Asia to Sem <a id="l10"></a>&amp; Afric to Ham without making any one lord of the <a id="l11"></a>others territories: so each of these divided his part <a id="l12"></a>between his sons &amp; each of them their parts between <a id="l13"></a>theirs without making any one lord of another's <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span> inhe<a id="l14"></a>ritance till the whole earth was distributed into inde<a id="l15"></a>pendent &amp; coordinate nations tribes &amp; families. For what <a id="l16"></a>Moses saith of the division of the whole earth among all <a id="l17"></a>the posterity of Noah, he saith of the division of the <a id="l18"></a>several parts among the posterity of his several sons. <a id="l19"></a>For when he had recconed up the children  &amp; grand <a id="l20"></a>children of Iaphet, he subjoins: <em class="underline">By these were the Isles <a id="l21"></a>of the gentiles divided in their lands every one after <a id="l22"></a>his tongue after their families in their nations</em>. And <a id="l23"></a>so of the rest. So then upon the first plantation of <a id="l24"></a>the earth there were no standing kingdoms. Every Father <a id="l25"></a>was sovereign Lord of his own inheritance during his life &amp; then <a id="l26"></a>the sons became sovereign lords of their several shares <a id="l27"></a>&amp; so on till the earth was planted with innumerable <a id="l28"></a>scattered families,  not yet subject to any other lords <a id="l29"></a>then the<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>ir<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> common fathers.  For I here reccon every father which all his posterity to be one family &amp; upon the fathers death to break into so many families as he has sons surviving him. These families by encrease of <a id="l30"></a>people soon grew into towns &amp;  a town consisting of many families required a Court &amp;  a Iudge to  make laws &amp;  common justice between them  &amp; thereby  became a city  &amp; cities which their villages either by  consent  or by conquering one another <a id="l32"></a>grew into kingdoms  greater &amp; greater till <a id="l33"></a> they arrived to the bigness they are now at. For in <a id="l34"></a> the first ages <a id="l35"></a>the Cities &amp; kingdoms were so small &amp; numerous that  <a id="l36"></a>Abraham which 318 men beat four kings which their armies  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span> when they had newly beaten five others: &amp; Ioshua <a id="l37"></a>found above thirty kingdoms in that small country the <a id="l38"></a>land of Canaan &amp; in the twelft part thereof which was <a id="l39"></a>Iudahs lot, there were 125 Cities besides villages. <a id="l40"></a>So Egypt after the death of Mizraim or Menes the <a id="l41"></a>common father of the Egyptians became divided into <a id="l42"></a>several kingdoms  which at length by swallowing up <a id="l43"></a>one another grew into one. Sir Iohn Marsham has <a id="l44"></a>given us catalogues of  the kings of four of those <a id="l45"></a>kingdoms down from the age  of their first king Menes  to the age of  the Patriarch <a id="l47"></a>Iacob.  These were the four which swallowed up the rest: for the great number of the ancient cities in Egy<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>pt<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l48"></a>shews that there were at first many more.

For Arphaxad was slain in the 12<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l84"></a>of Nebuchadonosor according to Ieromes version of the book of <a id="l85"></a>Iudith out of the original Chaldee, and Phraortes was slain <a id="l86"></a>75 years before the thirty years reign of Cyrus according to <a id="l87"></a>Herodotus &amp; by consequence in the year of Nabonassar 113 <a id="l88"></a>or the 13<sup>th</sup> year of Chiniladan.

<p id="par5">The last king of Assyria was Sardanapalus.

Whence  I reccon that the <a id="l121"></a>four last kings of Assyria were Assarhaddon, Nebuchadonosor, Ana<a id="l122"></a>cyndaraxis &amp; Sardanapalus, &amp; that the kings of Babylon Saosducinus, <a id="l123"></a>Chiniladon &amp; Nabopolassar were Satrapas under the three last of them untill <a id="l124"></a>Nabopolasser revolted from Sardanapalus. In Anchiale Sardanapalus  built a sepulcher for himself, but <a id="l126"></a>whether he was buried in it may be doubted seing authors tells us that <a id="l127"></a>he was burnt in Nineveh.

<p id="par9">By the fall of Nineveh the kingdom of Babylon which had hitherto been <a id="l174"></a>a small one, grew great &amp; potent.  The reigns of its kings are  <a id="l175"></a>stated in Ptolemy's Canon: for understanding which you are to note that every <a id="l176"></a>kings reign in that Canon began which the last Thoth of his Predecessor – – – <a id="l177"></a>– – – – months &amp; days by other authors.  Whence it appears  from that Canon that Chiniladon <a id="l188"></a>died  in the year of Nabonassar 123, Nabopolassar in the <a id="l189"></a>year 144 &amp; Nebuchadnezzar in the year 187. This last king died in the 37<sup>the</sup> year of Iehojakins captivity (2 King. XXV.27) &amp; therefore <a id="l190"></a>Iehojakin was captivated in the 150<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonassar. This captivity <a id="l191"></a>was in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign over Iudea (2 King. XXIV.<a id="l192"></a>12) For the first year of his reign  was the fourth of <a id="l193"></a>Iehojakims &amp; Iehojakim reigned 11 years before this captivity (2 King XXIII <a id="l194"></a>36) &amp; therefore Nebuchadnezzar began his reign in Iudea in the year of <a id="l195"></a>Nabonassar 142 two years before his fathers death &amp; three years before that, <a id="l196"></a> viz<sup>t</sup> in the year of Nabonassar 139 Iehojakim succeeded his father Iosiah. <a id="l197"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003v"> &lt;3v&gt; </span></p>
<p id="par10">And as the Chaldeans counted the reign of their kings by the years <a id="l199"></a>of Nabonassar, so the Iews (as their authors tell us)<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> counted the reign of theirs by the years of <a id="l200"></a>Moses beginning every year which the month Nisan. For if any king com<a id="l201"></a>menced his reign a few days before this month began it was recconed to him <a id="l202"></a>for a whole year &amp; the beginning of this month was accounted the beginning of <a id="l203"></a>the second year of his reign. According to which recconing the first year of <a id="l204"></a>Iehojakim began with the month Nisan in the year of Nabonasser 139. An. Abr. 1392, tho his reign might not really begin till 4 or 5 months after.</p>
<p id="par11">In this year therefore Pharaoh Nechoh the successor of Psammiticus <a id="l205"></a>came with a great army out of Egypt against the king of Assyria – – – – – <a id="l206"></a>– – – to tribute. And this war being waged against the king of Assyria, the <a id="l207"></a>kingdom of Assyria was not yet <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">overthrown</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">fallen</span></span> (for the king of Babylon is never called king of Assyria in scripture. But it fell within a year <a id="l208"></a>or two. For in the third year of Iehojakim Nebuchadnezzar assisted by Asti<a id="l209"></a>bares (that is Assuerus) king of the Medes, in pursuing their victory over the <a id="l210"></a>Assyrians, came with an army</p>

<p id="par13">Darius was the son of Assuerus Achsueres (or Ahasuirus as the Masorets corruptly call him) of the seed or royal <a id="l215"></a>family of the Medes. Dan 9.1. Achsuerus, Oxyares, &amp; Axeres or Cy-Axeres that is Prince Axeres are <a id="l216"></a>the same name  For that king who took Nineveh is by Tobit called Assuerus &amp; by Herodotus Cyaxeres. Now Cyaxeres (according to Xenophon) was the son of Artyages &amp; succeeded him in the throne <a id="l217"></a>of the Medes,  &amp;  as Astyages gave one of his daughters Mandane to Cambyses the father <a id="l218"></a>of Cyrus &amp; another of his daughters to Nebuchadnezzar, so Cyaxeres gave his daughter to Cyrus, not after the taking of Babylon as Xenophon <a id="l219"></a>represents but long before when she was young &amp; handsome. For  Xenophon tells us that she was <a id="l220"></a>reported to be very handsome &amp; that she &amp; Cyrus were playfellows when they were both children &amp; that <a id="l221"></a>she used then to say that she would marry Cyrus;  &amp; I reccon that Cambyses who succeeded Cyrus <a id="l222"></a>was her son.

P. I. 4645. Asia minor (the northern head) fell into the hands <a id="l293"></a>of Antigonus &amp; his son Demetrius  who reigned <a id="l294"></a>there till Demetrius was conquered by Seleucus king of Syria an. P. I 4426. <a id="l295"></a>From which time the kingdoms of Asia &amp; Syria  remained united under one <a id="l296"></a>king.

<p id="par25">So then these four regions of Greece Asia Syria &amp; Egypt  at first <a id="l301"></a>&amp; in the reign of Vespasian &amp; Titus &amp; being propagated through their Empires  took away at length separated from it &amp; became the Greek Empire seated at Constantinop<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>le<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> And this was the little horn of the Goat which came out of a distinct kingdoms of the Greeks &amp; then uniting under the Romans &amp; after the <a id="l302"></a>separation of the Greeks from the Latins composed the united body of the Greek Empire <a id="l303"></a>which was monarchick &amp; stood intire till the Saracens invaded it &amp; therefore they may justly be <a id="l304"></a>recconed the four  heads &amp; wings of that  Empire &amp; to compose that body <a id="l305"></a>which to this day is represented by the four headed &amp; four winged Leopard &amp; by  the Goat <a id="l306"></a>which four  horns  which Daniel tells us signifies the  kingdom of the Greeks <a id="l307"></a>divided towards the four winds of heaven. § And whilst the three first Beasts <a id="l308"></a>signify to this day all the nations of the Assyrian Medo-Persian &amp; Grecian <a id="l309"></a>Empires, that is all the nations from India to Greece &amp; Egypt there remains for the body of the fourth Beast – – – – three of <a id="l310"></a>them in its rise. These Beasts or Kingdoms are  distinguished also by their language. <a id="l311"></a>The first spake the  Assyrian &amp; Chaldean, the second the Persian, the third <a id="l312"></a>Greek &amp; the fourth the Latin. For  the Greek was spoken in all the  <a id="l313"></a>Greek Empire &amp; the Latin in all the Latin. But the Greek was not spoken in the <a id="l314"></a>Latin Empire nor the Latin in the Greek. By this character therefore the third <a id="l315"></a>&amp; fourth Beast are distinguisht even when they are united in dominion. And by <a id="l316"></a>these commotions the Latin Empire became divided</p>

The first are the Latins the other the nations of the former empires, &amp; principally of the Greeks <a id="l324"></a>Those nations it  subdued &amp; reigned over but they belong to the bodies of <a id="l325"></a>the three former Beasts. <em class="underline">And it was divers from all the Beasts that were before <a id="l326"></a>it</em>. They were governed by Kings, this by a Senate &amp; yearly Consuls. <em class="underline">And it had <a id="l327"></a>ten horns</em>: that is it became divided into ten kingdoms. It was not so divided at its <a id="l328"></a>first rise  for then it could not have been so dreadfull &amp; exceeding strong, but in <a id="l329"></a>the latter part of its reign it  became divided. The first part of its <a id="l330"></a>reign is signified by the iron legs of Nebuchadnezzars statue &amp; in their reign the <a id="l331"></a>kingdom is said to be strong as iron &amp; to break in pieces &amp; bruise as iron that <a id="l332"></a>breaketh  in pieces &amp; subdueth all things Dan 2.33, 40. The latter part of its <a id="l333"></a>reign is signified by the feet of the statue which consisted of iron &amp; clay mixed <a id="l334"></a>together &amp; had ten toes. In  respect of the toes Daniel saith the kingdom shall <a id="l335"></a>be divided &amp; in respect of the iron &amp; clay  which adhere not together that it shall <a id="l336"></a>be partly strong as iron &amp; partly brittle &amp; they shall not cleave together. Dan. 2.41, 42, 43. We are <a id="l337"></a>therefore to seek for the ten horns in the latter times of the fourth kingdom <a id="l338"></a>when it begins to grow weak &amp; divided. <em class="underline">The ten horns out of this kingdom</em>, saith Daniel <a id="l339"></a><em class="underline">are ten kings that shall arise &amp; another shall arise after them</em>.</p>
<p id="par27">Now the Roman Empire continued  in its full strength till the death <a id="l340"></a>of  Theodosius which was 561 years  dated from the conquest of  Greece by the Romans &amp; if at any time it  was shaken  as <a id="l341"></a>in the time of the 30 Tyrants  or divided, as at the death of Constantine, it soon recovered. Theodosius  left it divided into the Greek &amp; Latin Empires seated <a id="l344"></a>at Rome &amp; Constantinople &amp; the Latin Empire twelve or 13 years after  viz<sup>t</sup> in the yeare 408 409 &amp; 410 it became divided <a id="l345"></a>at once into  ten kingdoms. /For in the  end of  A.C. 407 a great army  of divers northern nations   under several kings, the Vandals under Godegisilus the  Alans in two bodies one under  Goar another under Resplendial, the Suevi under Ermeric &amp; the Burgundians under Gundicar  being invited by Stilico a Roman general arose from their seats in Germany &amp; Sarmatia passed the Rhine at Ments, the last day of December &amp; invaded the adjacent parts of Gallia/ Thereupon the Salian Francs who had been long seated in the Empire  in the regions of Toxandria &amp; Tongria rose up in arms  attackt &amp; routed the Vandals slew 20000 of them which their king  Godegisilus &amp; had slain the rest had not  a body of Alans come to their assistance. Then Resplendial with his Alans &amp; the Vandals &amp; Suevi  went from the Rhene towards Spain &amp; being stopt for a time by the Pyrenean mountains ravaged Aquitain &amp; the neighbouring parts of Gallia  But upon the 28 of Sept A.C. 409 the Pyrenean passage  was betrayed to them &amp; they entered   &amp; harassed  Spain &amp; at length A.C. 411 divided their conquests by lot.</p>
<p id="par28">In the meane time the other Barbarians harrassed Gallia &amp; the Britains fell off from the Empire &amp;   &amp; while the  Latin Empire was thus enga<a id="l360"></a>ged Stilico designing to invade the Greek Empire called the Visigoths from their <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> seats in Pannonia where they lived in subjection to the Empire &amp; sent them into <a id="l361"></a>Epire under the command of Alaricus designing soon after to follow them with his army. But being stopt by the Emperor &amp; <a id="l362"></a>afterwards detected &amp; slain as a Traytor Alaric  returned back from <a id="l363"></a>Epire  &amp; calling his brother out of Pannonia which what <a id="l364"></a> force he had there,  invaded Italy A.C. 408. And at the same time <a id="l365"></a>the Hunns invaded  the deserted seats of the Goths in Pannonia &amp; <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Alyricam<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; the <a id="l366"></a>western Emperor fearing to be shut up in Rome retired to Ravenna.  <a id="l367"></a>For the Goths beseiged Rome &amp; took it A.C. 410,  &amp; then seated themselves <a id="l368"></a>in Gallia. This was the occasion &amp; manner of rending the Latin or Western <a id="l369"></a>Empire into  ten kingdoms, &amp; these kingdoms are as follows.</p>
<p id="par29">1 The Kingdom of the Vandals.  They invaded Gallia A.C. 408, Spain <a id="l370"></a>A.C. 409 &amp; Afric A.C. 427 &amp; reigned in Afric till A.C. 533.. In Spain they were seated in Gallicia &amp; Bœtica <a id="l371"></a>Their Kings were Godegisilus, Gunderic, Geiseric Hunneric Gundemund Thrasa<a id="l372"></a>mund Hilderic Gelimer.</p>
<p id="par30">2 The   Kingdom of the Suevians. They entred Spain A.C. 409 <a id="l373"></a>  grew a potent kingdom &amp; reigned there 177 years. They <a id="l374"></a>were seated in Gallæcia &amp; Lusitania &amp; afterwards in Betica also &amp; the <a id="l375"></a>Carthaginensian Province. Their Kings were Ermeric, Rechila, Rehiarius <a id="l376"></a>Maldra Frumarius Regis mundus &amp;c.</p>
<p id="par31">The kingdom of the Alans in Spain. This was the most potent of the <a id="l377"></a>Barbarous kingdoms in Spain but lasted only ten years in its greatness. Its <a id="l378"></a>kings were Resplendial &amp; Ataces. The Visigoths A.C.  419 slew Ataces which <a id="l379"></a>almost all his army. And then the Alans subjected themselves to Gunderic king <a id="l380"></a>of the Vandals but the next year withdrew their obedience &amp; returned to Lusi<a id="l381"></a>tania &amp; the Carthagenensian province where they lived as in a Commonwealth without a king tribu<a id="l382"></a>tary to the Romans giving the name  Catalonia (i.e. Catti-Alania) to <a id="l383"></a>the region &amp; in the year 448 they warred upon the Romans  in Carpentam <a id="l384"></a>&amp; the Carthaginensian province &amp; wasted their cities but were soon checkt <a id="l385"></a>by the Suevians</p>
<p id="par32">4 The kingdom of the Alans in Gallia. Their kings were Goar Sambida <a id="l386"></a>Eocharich, Sangibanus, Beurgus &amp;c. Vnder Goar they invaded Gallia A.C. 408 &amp; had seats given them by the Emperor neare <a id="l387"></a>the Rhene A.C. 412 as had also their Confederates the Burgundians. Vnder Sambida  <a id="l388"></a>they had the territories of Valence given them by Ætius the Emperors general A.C <a id="l389"></a>440.  Vnder Eocharic they had a region of the rebelling Armorici given them by Ætius &amp; conquered it. This region was from them named Alenconium quasi Alanorum conventus. Vnder Sangibanus they were invaded &amp; their regal city Orleans beseiged by <a id="l390"></a>Attila king of the Hunns which a vast army. Whereupon Ætius &amp; his associates came to <a id="l391"></a>raise the siege &amp; beat the Hunns in  that memorable battel AC 491 in campi Catalannici <a id="l392"></a>so called from these Alans mixt which the Chatti. The region is now contractly <a id="l393"></a>called Campain. A year or two after Attila returned again which an immense army <a id="l394"></a>to conquer this kingdom but was again beaten by them &amp; the Goths who came <a id="l395"></a>to their assistance in a battel of three days continuance which a slaughter almost as great as the former. Vnder Beurgus or Biorgor they infested Gallia round about <a id="l396"></a>till the reign of Maximus the Emperor &amp; then they  past the Alps <a id="l397"></a>in winter &amp; came into Liguria but were there beaten &amp; Beurgus slain by Ricimer <a id="l398"></a>the Emperors General. A.C. 464. Afterwards they were again beaten by the joint force of Odoacer <a id="l399"></a>king of Italy &amp; Childeric king of the Francks about the year 480, &amp; again by <a id="l400"></a> Theudebert king of the Austrian Franks about the year 511</p>
<p id="par33">5 The kingdom of the Burgundians. Their Kings were Gundicar, Gundioc, <a id="l401"></a>Bilimer, Gundobald, Sigismund, Godomarus. Vnder Gundicar they invaded Gallia A.C. <a id="l402"></a>408 &amp; had seats given them  by the Emperor neare the Rhene in Gallia Belgica A.C. 412 <a id="l403"></a>They were now so potent that Orosius A.C. 417 wrote of them Burgunionum esse <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006v"> &lt;6v&gt; </span> prævalidam et perniciosam manum Galliæ hodieque testes sunt in quibus praesumpta possessione <a id="l404"></a>consistunt. About the year 435 they received great overthrows by Ætius &amp; soon <a id="l405"></a>after by the Huns, but five years after had Savoy granted them to be shared which <a id="l406"></a>the Inhabitants, &amp; from that time they became again a potent kingdom being <a id="l407"></a>for a time bounded by the river Rhodanus but afterwards extending much further into the heart <a id="l408"></a>of Gallia. Gundobald conquered the regions about the rivers Araris &amp; Rhodanus which <a id="l409"></a>the territories of Marseille &amp; invaded Italy in the reign of Glycerius. Godomarus made <a id="l410"></a>Orleans his royal seat whence the kingdom was called Regnum Aurelianorum. He was <a id="l411"></a>conquered by Clotharius &amp; Childebert kings of the Francks A.C. 526. And from thence <a id="l412"></a>forward this kingdom was sometimes united to the kingdom of the Franks sometimes <a id="l413"></a>divided from it till the reign of Charles the great who made his son Carotus king <a id="l414"></a>of Burgundy  From  that time for above 300 years together it enjoyed its <a id="l415"></a>proper kings, And was then broken into the Dukedome of Burgundy &amp; County of Burgundy <a id="l416"></a>&amp; County of Savoy, &amp; afterwards those were broken into other less counties.</p>

<p id="par38">In the prophesies of Daniel that which is usually <a id="l453"></a>translated the <em class="underline">daily  sacrifice</em> is  <a id="l454"></a>in the Hebrew only called the <em class="underline">daily</em> &amp; may be   as properly translated the <em class="underline">daily worship.</em> This <a id="l456"></a>worship is opposite to the abomination of desolation that is <a id="l457"></a>to the worship of fals Gods &amp; Idols &amp; in that respect <a id="l458"></a>signifies the worship of the true God without an image. <a id="l459"></a>such a worship as is prescribed in the first &amp; second <a id="l460"></a>commandment. Thou shall have no other Gods be<a id="l461"></a>fore me: And thou shalt not make to thy self any graven <a id="l462"></a>image.  Thou shalt have in thy worship no other Gods in my sight, thou shalt <a id="l463"></a> worship me alone the God who in six days <a id="l464"></a>made the heaven &amp; earth &amp; all that in them is &amp; rested <a id="l465"></a>the seventh day, &amp; thou shalt not add to me any other <a id="l466"></a>Gods in thy worship, neither shalt thou make to thee <a id="l467"></a>in thy worship any graven image or the likeness of <a id="l468"></a>any thing. For these  commandments <a id="l469"></a>are practical &amp; respect the worship of the Iews. We are not forbidden to give the name of Gods to Angels &amp; kings but we are forbidden to worship them ‡<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 8v &gt; </span> ‡ them as Gods.  We are forbidden to worship them not only as supreme infinite &amp; eternal Gods but even as <a id="l470"></a>inferior &amp; subordinate Gods. We are forbidden to worship them in such a sense as the heathens worshipped their <a id="l471"></a>Gods who took them for nothing more then  the souls of  dead men mediators between God &amp; man <a id="l472"></a>Lords who reigned over us under the supreme God. For to us in our worship there is but one God the father almighty &amp; one <a id="l473"></a>mediator between God &amp; man, the  man Christ Iesus; one God &amp; one Lord; one God to whom <a id="l474"></a>we are to give honour &amp; glory &amp; praise &amp; thanks &amp; worship for creating all things &amp; preserving us &amp; giving us our daily bread &amp;  to whom we <a id="l475"></a>are to direct our prayers for what we want; &amp; one Lord &amp; Mediator to whom we are to give honour &amp; glory &amp; thanks for redeeming <a id="l476"></a>us with his blood &amp; in whose name we are to direct all our prayers to God. And this worship of one God  untill the <a id="l477"></a>coming of the Messiah &amp; of one God &amp; one Lord ever since his  his resurrection from the dead is the principall part of the <a id="l478"></a>daily worship. For there was also a less principal part which consisted in offering sacrifices to God. The first part is moral &amp; <a id="l479"></a> the second is only ceremonial. The first was performed in all the synagogues, the second was performed only in the <a id="l480"></a><span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span></p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 7r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par39">Now the worship of this  God was partly ceremonial <a id="l481"></a>&amp; transient, partly moral &amp; eternal. The ceremonial part <a id="l482"></a>consisted principally in sacrifices, the moral in prayers praises <a id="l483"></a>&amp; thanksgivings. The gentiles sacrificed in all their cities, &amp; <a id="l484"></a>To take away these sacrifices might have been difficult &amp; therefore <a id="l485"></a>Moses  did not totally take them away but only restrained them to the Tabernacle,   &amp; to  render them the more significant &amp; pious he made them typical. The moral <a id="l487"></a>worship which consisted in prayers praises &amp; thanksgiving was <a id="l488"></a>performed daily  in all <a id="l489"></a>  in all the synagogues. For this purpose there was a synagogue in the Temple, there was a synagogue in every city of the Iews &amp; there might be a synagogue of either Iews or Christians in any city of the Romans * <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the right margin of f 7r &gt; </span>* &amp; in like manner the Christian synagogues called Cathedral Churches were set up in  the cities of the <a id="l492"></a>Christians &amp; had a daily worship in them.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 7r resumes &gt; </span> And this daily worship in the synagogues being more excellent &amp; universal then that of sacrificing in the Temple  deserves in this prophesy much more to be represented &amp; called the daily.  is chiefly opposed to the abomination of deso<a id="l493"></a>lation &amp; lasted till that abomination was set up in its room not only in the Temple but  more especially in the synagogues of both Iews &amp; Christian Gentiles</p>

<p id="par41">Now this daily worship was taken away from the synagogues of the Iews <a id="l510"></a>&amp; the abomination of desolation set up in their land in the <a id="l511"></a>reign of the Emperor Adrian when the Iews were banished <a id="l512"></a>their land upon pain of dearth &amp; the worship of the Gentiles <a id="l513"></a>was set up in all their cities. But in the synagogues or <a id="l514"></a>Cathedral Churches of the Christians the daily worship remained <a id="l515"></a>untill the king arose who did according to his will &amp; in his <a id="l516"></a>seat together with a strange God  set up the worship of Mahuzzims <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> that is, untill a new Greek Empire arose. For the whole <a id="l517"></a>prophesy of the scripture of truth concerns the Greek Empire <a id="l518"></a>The Greeks continued in subjection to the Latines till the  building of Constantinople &amp; then  <a id="l520"></a>  separated &amp;  became a new  Empire <a id="l523"></a>seated at that city, &amp; accordingly is represented in this prophesy by a new king the king who <a id="l524"></a>doth according to his will &amp; sets up the worship of Mahuzzims with <a id="l525"></a>a strange God whom his fathers knew not &amp; prospers in these practices till <a id="l526"></a>the indignation be accomplished. § The daily worship was to be taken away <a id="l527"></a>by the last horn of the He Goat, &amp; the He Goat is by Daniel interpreted <a id="l528"></a>to signify the King of Greece, &amp; his last horn is said to  wax <a id="l529"></a>exceeding great even to the host of heaven &amp; to cast down of the stars to the grownd &amp; is called a king of fierce countenance whose power <a id="l530"></a>should be mighty but not by his own power, which (as we said) is to be <a id="l531"></a>understood of the Greeks growing mighty under the dominion &amp; by their power of the Romans. In this <a id="l532"></a>state he was to  grow exceeding great even to the host of heaven &amp; <a id="l533"></a>to cast down of the  starrs to the grownd: which is to be understood of <a id="l534"></a>his  making desolate the Iews &amp; persecuting the Christians. And after this he is said <a id="l535"></a>to magnify himself even to the Prince of the host &amp; to  take away the daily <a id="l536"></a>worship &amp; cast down the place of his sanctury. The Prince of the host is <a id="l537"></a>Iesus Christ &amp;  therefore the daily worship here taken away <a id="l538"></a>is the worship of the Christians &amp; the place of his sanctuary is the place <a id="l539"></a>of the worship of the Christians, that is their synagogues or  <a id="l540"></a>Cathedral Churches taken collectively. For these are the Temple of God in which the <a id="l541"></a>man of sin was to sit as a God after he had taken away the dayly worship. <a id="l542"></a>And to this double exaltation of this horn, (first up to heaven to cast down <a id="l543"></a>of the stars to the grownd &amp; then up to the Prince of the host  to take away the daily worship)  answers the double state of the daily worship which was to be taken away, first the Iewish &amp; then the Christian &amp; the <a id="l545"></a>double state of the Arms which in the prophesy of the scripture of truth stand up after Antiochus Ephiphanes. First <a id="l546"></a>those arms stand up &amp; pollute the Iewish sanctuary of strength &amp; take <a id="l547"></a>away their daily worship &amp; place the abomination which maketh their <a id="l548"></a>land desolate, &amp; causeth those that understand amongst the people &amp; instruct <a id="l549"></a>many (that is the Christians) to fall by the sword &amp; by flame &amp; by captivity <a id="l550"></a>&amp; by spoile many days.  And when they <a id="l551"></a>should fall they  were to be holpen with a little help,  &amp; by  prosperity to grow numerous <a id="l552"></a>through flatterers cleaving to them, but they  were to fall again even to the <a id="l553"></a>time of the end. For the king who should then reign,  was to do according <a id="l554"></a>to his will &amp;  to exalt &amp; magnify himself above every God &amp; speak <a id="l555"></a>marvellous things against the God of Gods, &amp; which a strange God whom <a id="l556"></a>his fathers knew not  he was to worship Mahuzzims. And this  <a id="l557"></a> is his second exaltation &amp; answers to the  second exaltation of the  last horn  of the Goat his  exaltation up to the Prince of the host  that he might be able to take away the daily  worship.  And therefore the transgression of <a id="l560"></a>desolation which  now succeeded this daily worship is the worship of the <a id="l561"></a>Mahuzzims:   This transgression is called the <a id="l564"></a>abomination  to signify that it is idolatry &amp; the Abomination of <a id="l565"></a>desolation to signify that the idolaters are great persecutors &amp;  <a id="l566"></a>make desolate the people of God.  <a id="l568"></a>And from this transgression of the horn &amp; his magnifying himself &amp; standing up against the Prince of Princes the Apostle Paul calls  the man of sin  or transgression who  opposeth <a id="l571"></a>&amp; exalteth himself above every thing that is called God or that is worshipped. And from this opposition <a id="l572"></a>&amp; standing up against the Prince of Princes Iohn calls him Antichrist. The Apostle <a id="l573"></a>wrote these things to them of the Greek Churches &amp; therefore the man of sin &amp; the Antichrist was to <a id="l574"></a>reign in those churches, &amp; there to place their abomination &amp; <a id="l575"></a>make desolate the people of God. And <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008v"> &lt;8v&gt; </span> And this was to be done in the latter times.  And the king which doth according to his will <a id="l576"></a>set up the worship of Mahuzzims in the times next preceeding the time which Daniel calls the time <a id="l577"></a>of the end &amp; continued to reign in this time of the end because the king of the south then pusht at <a id="l578"></a>him.</p>

<p id="par43">The Iews regarded principally their worshipping in the Tem<a id="l579"></a>ple by sacrifices &amp; therefore took the daily to signify the daily sacrifice  And this interpretation was favoured by calling the place <a id="l581"></a>of this worship the sanctuary. But while it said  of the little horn of <a id="l582"></a>the He Goat that he magnified himself against the Prince of the host <a id="l583"></a>&amp; by him the daily <span class="hspac-n" title="6 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> was taken away &amp; the place of his sanctuary <a id="l584"></a>was  cast down, this sanctuary must be the sanctuary of the Prince <a id="l585"></a>of the host that is the sanctuary of Iesus Christ, &amp; by consequence in<a id="l586"></a>cludes the synagogues of the Christians taken collectively as the Church <a id="l587"></a>is taken collectively for all the Churches. And while this horn by means of an host which was given him overcame the host of heaven &amp; cast down <a id="l588"></a>not only the sanctuary but also the truth to the grownd &amp; practiced <a id="l589"></a>&amp; prospered: its acting against the sanctuary  even to the time of the end &amp; last end of the desolation: &amp; taking away the daily [worship] must be of the same <a id="l590"></a>extent which the host  of heaven &amp; the truth, that is which <a id="l591"></a>the Church of God &amp; the truth of his religion &amp; by consequence extend <a id="l592"></a>to the synagogues of the host where this truth was preached,  &amp; to be of long duration.  It was to be in the time of the end, &amp; to last till the  end of the indignation. <a id="l594"></a>In the latter time of the kingdom of the four horns,  when <a id="l595"></a>the transgressors were come to the full this horn was to stand up &amp; grow <a id="l596"></a>mighty but not in his own power, &amp; the vision concerning the  the daily &amp; the transgression (from the time that the <a id="l598"></a>transgressors were come to the full.) was to last 2300 prophetick days <a id="l599"></a>(which are not yet expired) &amp; then the sanctuary  was to be cleansed: &amp; <a id="l600"></a>therefore unless you will say that the Temple of  Ierusa<a id="l601"></a>lem alone is  to be cleansed for restoring the sacrifices, you must allow that the <a id="l602"></a>sanctuary of the synagogues &amp; the daily worship therein is comprehended <a id="l603"></a>in the words of this prophesy. And now having explained what is <a id="l604"></a>the daily [worship,] which was to be taken away &amp; what is the sanctuary wherein it was per<a id="l605"></a>formed, it will be more easy to understand what is the transgression <a id="l606"></a>of desolation which  was to be set up in this sanctuary <a id="l607"></a>in the room of that worship.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 8v resumes &gt; </span></div>

<h2 id="hd4" class="cent">Chap. <a id="l664"></a><br>Of the daily worship &amp; abomination of desolation.</h2>
<p id="par49">The Christian daily worship is represented in the Apocalyps by the Iewish. Here <a id="l665"></a>God is represented as it were sitting on a throne above the Ark between the Cherubins <a id="l666"></a>in the most Holy place.   The assembly of Presby<a id="l668"></a>ters are represented by the 24 Elders, the  Holy spirit &amp; the teachers or Bishops by the seven lamps &amp; the people <a id="l669"></a>by the four animals full of eyes in the outward court. The  animals worship <a id="l670"></a>God  day &amp; night or morning &amp; evening saying Holy holy <a id="l671"></a>holy Lord God Almighty who  was &amp; is &amp; is to come. And when they give him glory &amp; honour &amp; thanks the Elders <a id="l672"></a>fall down &amp; worship him &amp; give him glory &amp; honour &amp; thanks for creating all things <a id="l673"></a> This is the worship due from all the Church to God the father.  We are to worship <a id="l674"></a> him &amp; him alone  as the almighty &amp; <a id="l675"></a>ever living God who created all things &amp; gives us our daily bread. This the foundation of <a id="l676"></a>all religion</p>

<p id="par51">There was in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book of prophesy <a id="l678"></a> none was found worthy to open it or look upon it till the Lamb appeared &amp; <a id="l679"></a>  took the book. All foreknow<a id="l680"></a>ledge is originally in the breast of God Almighty &amp; <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>he<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> communicates it immediately <a id="l681"></a>to the Lamb alone who sends it by his spirit to the Prophets: whence the Lamb is <a id="l682"></a>called the <em class="underline">word of God</em> &amp; the testimony of Iesus is called the spirit of Prophesy &amp; the <a id="l683"></a>Apocalyps is called the Revelation of Iesus Christ which God gave unto him &amp; <a id="l684"></a>he sent his messenger &amp; signified it to his servant Iohn.<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> For the spirit of <a id="l685"></a>truth speaks not of himself but what he hears that he speaks, He receives from <a id="l686"></a>Christ &amp; shews it to the Prophets being sent unto them by Christ.</p>
<p id="par52">And when the Lamb had taken the book the  four animals &amp; 24 Elders fell down <a id="l687"></a> before him with harps &amp; vials of incence &amp; sung a new song saying Thou <a id="l688"></a>art worthy to take the book &amp; open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain &amp; hast redeemed <a id="l689"></a>us to God by thy blood. This is a worship  due not to the ever living God but to the Lamb <a id="l690"></a>alone &amp; is therefore given to him without any breach of the first or second commandment</p>

<h2 id="hd5" class="cent"> Sect. III. <a id="l691"></a><br>Of the daily worship  taken away &amp; the abomination of desolation  set up.</h2>
    <p id="par53">In the reign of Constantine the great &amp;  there were great disputes <a id="l693"></a>between several parties of the Church but without a separation. Some parties en<a id="l694"></a>deavoured to impose articles of faith in new forms of words: the seven Churches <a id="l695"></a>laboured against all new forms according to the Apostles rule; <em class="underline">Hold fast the form <a id="l696"></a>of sound words</em> (2 Tim. 1.13) <em class="underline">the form of doctrine which was delivered to you</em> (Rom. 6.<a id="l697"></a>17) <em class="underline">wholesom words, the words of our Lord Iesus Christ</em> (1 Tim. 6.3) <em class="underline">the words of <a id="l698"></a>faith</em> (1 Tim 4.6) These disputes about words were vehement but occasioned no separation till after <a id="l699"></a>the reign of Iulian. The visible Church catholick continued entire &amp; undivided <a id="l700"></a>from the days of the Apostles till the reign of Valentinian &amp; Valens &amp; then came on <a id="l701"></a>the hour of temptation  upon all the world.  Some few separated even in the days of the Apostles as <a id="l703"></a>Iohn represents. <em class="underline"> As ye have heard</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">that Antichrist shall come, even now <a id="l704"></a>there are many Antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. They <a id="l705"></a>went out from us but they were not of us: for if they had been of us they would <a id="l706"></a>no doubt have continued with us: but they went out that they might be made <a id="l707"></a>manifest that they were not  all of us</em> (1 Iohn. 2.19) And Iude: <em class="underline">These be they <a id="l708"></a>who separate themselves</em> (Iude 19)  But These were <a id="l710"></a>small separations &amp; continued to be made from time to time without endangering <a id="l711"></a>the Church catholick untill the Bishop of Rome with his adherents separated from her <a id="l712"></a>  which separation being very great &amp; fatal is represented in this prophesy by the  <a id="l713"></a>Woman's flying into the wilderness &amp; leaving behind her a remnant of her seed which keep <a id="l714"></a>the commandments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus &amp; by the rising of the two horned Beast out of the earth  after which the Dragon  made war upon the remnant of the womans seed till all separa<a id="l716"></a>ted &amp; worshipped the Beast &amp; his Image &amp; received his mark except the 144000. And <a id="l717"></a>by all these separations Christ spewed the Church of Laodicea out of his mouth. This was <a id="l718"></a>the daily worship of the first temple whose candlesticks were the seven Churches of Asia <a id="l719"></a>taken away; &amp; the abomination of  worship<a id="l729"></a>ping the Beast &amp; his Image &amp; receiving his mark set up in the room of it  in <a id="l730"></a>the outward court of the Temple where the people of God worshipped before. And <a id="l731"></a>this abomination turned the western Empire into a desolate wilderness &amp;  caused all in the eastern Empire to be killed or banished <a id="l734"></a>humane society who would not worship the Image of the Beast or receive his mark &amp; <a id="l735"></a>therefore was  an Abomination of desolation. And being placed in the great Temple of all the <a id="l736"></a>Roman Empire it was much more notable &amp; of far greater consequence then  any abomination<a id="l737"></a> that ever was placed in the Temple of  the Iews at Ierusalem,  &amp; so answers much better to the abomination of desolation spoken of by Dani<a id="l739"></a>el &amp; Christ.  So soon as that <a id="l740"></a>which letted   should <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>be<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> taken out of the way  there was to <a id="l741"></a>be a great Apostasy &amp; the man of sin was to be revealed who opposeth &amp; exalteth himself <a id="l742"></a>above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the Temple of <a id="l743"></a>God shewing himself that he is God. By that which letted the <a id="l744"></a>primitive Christians understood the  Roman Empire. And  when the heathen <a id="l745"></a>Roman Empire,  which preserved the Christian religion from corruption, was taken out of <a id="l746"></a>the way, the Beast quickly appeared &amp; was deified &amp; he &amp; his image were worshipped  in the outward court of  the great Temp<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>le<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l747"></a>of  God.
