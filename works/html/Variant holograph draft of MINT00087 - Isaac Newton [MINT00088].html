    <p id="par1">Tis  suggested that the Queens Assaymaster is a cheque <a id="l1"></a>upon the Officers of the Mint &amp; that M<sup>r</sup> Brattle being under the direction of the Officers hath acted partially: whereas on the contrary, the Comptrol<a id="l2"></a>ler is a cheque upon the whole Mint  &amp; <a id="l3"></a>all the three first Officers are a cheque upon the Assaymaster. For <a id="l4"></a>he has no trial piece of his own but performs his Assays by their Trial pieces &amp; in their present <a id="l5"></a>&amp; his Assays without their approbation are of no force. In <a id="l6"></a>overseeing his Assays the Warden &amp; Comptroller act in behalf <a id="l7"></a>of the Queen &amp; her people &amp; the Master acts for himself: &amp; <a id="l8"></a>the Assaymaster acts only as a manual Artificer &amp; is to act with skill &amp; sincerity  to the <a id="l9"></a>satisfaction of the Officers of both parties. For its easy for an Assayer <a id="l10"></a>to give a turn to the Assay, of a quarter of a grain or an halfpenny <a id="l11"></a>weight or above, for or against the Master. And if any such thing <a id="l12"></a>be suspected, the Assayer must repeat his Assay till the Officers of the <a id="l13"></a>Mint are satisfied of his acting with skill &amp; candour. And if any Importe<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>r<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l14"></a>think himself aggr<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>ieved<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> he hath a remedy prescribed, which is an appeal not to persons not concerned, but <a id="l15"></a>to a trial by the Wardens Trialpiece.</p>
    
    <p id="par2">It was right therefore for the Lord High Treasurer to refer <a id="l16"></a>the four Petitioners to a triall before the Officers of the Mint <a id="l17"></a>as the proper judges of their qualifications in print of skill.</p>
    
    <p id="par3">Now the direction given to M<sup>r</sup> Brattle were no other then those given <a id="l18"></a>to his brother Her Majestys late Assaymaster two years before his death &amp; <a id="l19"></a>they have been executed more exactly by the present M<sup>r</sup> Brattle then <a id="l20"></a>by his brother, &amp; they were to  coin by the Trial piece of K. Iames. The <a id="l22"></a>Pot Assay pieces of the Gold coined  after the Trial of the Pix 1710 untill <a id="l23"></a>those directions were given being melted down together &amp; assayed with that triall piece  were found to agree with it, the ballance <a id="l25"></a>standing at the cock. And all the Gold money coined since that Trial of the <a id="l26"></a>Pix being lately tried by the same Trial piece,  the Iury found them equal in fine<a id="l27"></a>ness the scales standing at the cock. And After the money hath been found <a id="l28"></a> well coined by a Iury, the Master of the Mint hath a legal right to be quiet against <a id="l29"></a>all the Queens subjects for what is past.</p>
    
    <p id="par4">To err within the Remedy is no crime. It only creates a  a <a id="l30"></a>reconning between the Queen &amp; the Master. If the Master has got by the <a id="l31"></a>error he must refund his profit to the Queen: if he has lost, the Queen re<a id="l32"></a>turns his loss. And if the error be under a quarter of a grain or an halfpenny <a id="l33"></a>weight, it is neglected by ancient custome &amp; creates not so much as a reccon<a id="l34"></a>ing. If the error be by designe the  only punishment is that the Master <a id="l35"></a>must be at teh charge of recoining the mony before delivery. If it be <a id="l36"></a>without designe the money is deliverable notwithstanding, provided the error <a id="l37"></a>be within the remedy. But nothing less then a quarter of a grain <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>us<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>es to <a id="l38"></a>be recconned an error or taken notice of in the received method of assaying. The <a id="l39"></a>Iury takes no notice of any thing less.</p>
    
    <p id="par5">All the bullion is received by the Masters Triall-piece. And if <a id="l40"></a>the Importer shal at any <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>time<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> think himself aggrieved by the Masters assay, he hath <a id="l41"></a> an appal to the wardens trial piece. This is his proper remedy &amp; his only remedy against the Master. But if the Importers do not <a id="l42"></a>appeal, there is no reason why those that are not Importers nor have anything to do with the Mint should be allowed <a id="l43"></a>to complain.  They may admonish <a id="l44"></a>the Importers to appeale but that have not so much as a right to appeal them<a id="l45"></a>selves, or to give the Officers of the Mint any molestation. For the coinage is not to <a id="l46"></a>be made   impracticable.</p>
    
    <p id="par6">When M<sup>r</sup> Brattel &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Oadham had a comparative Trial before the Officers of the <a id="l47"></a>Mint, they made each of them eight assays of Gold in four successive fires, two in 
        
        <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p100v"> &lt;100v&gt; </span>
        
        each fire, &amp; as many of silver. Some of M<sup>r</sup> Oadhams assays  taken from <a id="l48"></a>one &amp; the same piece of gold differed from others a quarter of a grain, &amp; <a id="l49"></a>one of them erred two grains which is three times the Remedy, &amp; the error was <a id="l50"></a>in fineness &amp; therefore not likely to be by mere accident. Whereas all M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l51"></a>Brattles Gold assays agreed perfectly with one another except one which differed from <a id="l52"></a>the rest only about the twelft part of a grain, which is but the eighth part <a id="l53"></a>of the Remedy. And almost all the coinage is in gold. M<sup>r</sup> Brattle was <a id="l54"></a>also observed to handle things with more dexterity &amp; dispatch</p>
    
    <p id="par7">At that time M<sup>r</sup> Oadham was offered a fuller trial by more assays <a id="l55"></a>&amp; did not then desire it, but has since desired another trial. Had acknow<a id="l56"></a>ledged the fairness of that trial, &amp; that he had since been learning to <a id="l57"></a>assay better &amp; was now grown more skilfull then before his request <a id="l58"></a>might have been granted without a reflexion upon the Mint: but <a id="l59"></a>he pretends to have learnt his skill long ago in his Apprenticeship &amp; has <a id="l60"></a>appealed from the Report of the Officers, If declining a Trial by an objection against some of the Petitioners, appealing from the Report of the Officers &amp; labouring is a greater objection <a id="l61"></a>against M<sup>r</sup> Oadham. &amp; now in opposition to it produces <a id="l62"></a>a certificate of his skill in assaying signed by Merchants &amp; Goldsmiths. <a id="l63"></a>But it doth not appear that his subscribers are men of note for skill in <a id="l64"></a>assaying or ever met to see him make a competent number of successive assays <a id="l65"></a>whereby they might judge of his skill. They are merchants, shopkeepers <a id="l66"></a>&amp; plateworkers &amp; generally trust the assays of the Hall.</p>
    
    <p id="par8">The Importers are proper Iudges not of hte skill of an Assaymaster <a id="l67"></a>but whether they will freely trust him with their bullion. Amongst his sub<a id="l68"></a>scribers there are only six who have imported gold within these three <a id="l69"></a>years, &amp; all of them together have imported only to the value of <a id="l70"></a>about 14 thousand pounds: whereas the Importers who have signed a <a id="l71"></a>paper for M<sup>r</sup> Brattle (as I am credibly informed, for I have not <a id="l72"></a>sen it) have imported to the value of  eight or nine hundred <a id="l73"></a>thousand pounds within that time. All the Importers trust M<sup>r</sup> Brattel <a id="l74"></a>freely with their bullion, but M<sup>r</sup> Oadhams credit is not yet established <a id="l75"></a>among them. And a miscariage in the Assay-Office  would be a disco<a id="l76"></a>ragement to the coinage.</p>
    
    <span class="pagenumber" id="p101r"> &lt;101r&gt; </span>
    
    <p id="par9">It was very right therefore for the Lord High Treasurer to refer  all the <a id="l77"></a>Petitioners to a trial before the Officers of the Mint &amp; it was not right in <a id="l78"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Oadham to appeal from their Report  
        
        <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 101r &gt; </span>to defame them &amp; to make an interest against them. The increase of the coin depends <a id="l82"></a>upon the credit  of the Officers with Importers &amp; this credit is at present very <a id="l83"></a>good &amp; its the interest of the Government to support it.</p>
    
    <p id="par10">To say that M<sup>r</sup> Brattel being under the direction of the Officers <a id="l84"></a>of the Mint hath acted partially, is to object against the very constitution <a id="l85"></a>of the Mint. For the Queens Assaymaster is &amp; ought to be as much under the direction <a id="l86"></a>of the Officers in assaying the money as M<sup>r</sup> Brattel is at present. <a id="l87"></a>And the directions given<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from higher up f 101r resumes &gt; </span>
        
        reflect upon <a id="l88"></a>them &amp; endeavour to carry his point by interest. If declining a Trial be an objection <a id="l89"></a>against <span class="gap" title="Illegible text (Extent: 3 characters)">{illeg}</span>a of the  Petitioners  appealing from a Report of the Officers to the proper Iudges is a greater <a id="l90"></a>objection against M<sup>r</sup> Oadham.</p>
    
    <p id="par11">The directions given to M<sup>r</sup> Brattel  against all the Queens subjects <a id="l91"></a>for what is past. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="par12">Before the late trial of the Pix the Master of the Mint  for obviating complaints which might arise, ordered the money for the Assay <a id="l95"></a>to be kept from time to time to be reassayed by the Queens Assaymaster so soo <a id="l96"></a>as there should be one appointed by her Majesty. And now he ordered <a id="l97"></a>the like to be done for the future.  Which is the utmost care that <a id="l98"></a>he can take for the satisfaction of people in this matter &amp; for keeping <a id="l99"></a>up the credit of the Mint.</p>
    
    <p id="par13">All the Bullion is received by the Masters trial piece. And if the <a id="l100"></a>Importer at any time thinks himself injured by the Masters  <a id="l101"></a>Assays he hath a remedy appointed by law, which remedy is an appeal <a id="l102"></a>to the Wardens trial piece. But the Importers do not appeal &amp; if they <a id="l103"></a>do not complain of the Masters assays, those that are not Importers nor <a id="l104"></a>have any thing to do with the Mint should not be allowed to complain.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="par15">By the constitution of the Mint the Master &amp; Worker receives &amp; coins <a id="l105"></a>all the Bullion of gold &amp; silver by his own trial-piece. The Importer <a id="l106"></a>hath at all times an Appeal from the Masters Assays to a trial by the Wardens trial <a id="l107"></a>piece: And the Queen &amp; all her people have an Appeal to the Trial piece <a id="l108"></a>of the Exchequer at every trial of the Pix. If any Importer is dissatisfied <a id="l109"></a>with the Masters Assays &amp; will appeale to a trial by the Wardens <a id="l110"></a>Trial piece: the Queen &amp; Council or the Lord High Treasurer may appoint <a id="l111"></a>any indifferent person or persons skilled in Assaying  to stand <a id="l112"></a>by &amp; see the whole Trial. But if the Importers do not complain, M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l113"></a>Oadham &amp; his friends who are not Importers have no right  to appeal complain or intermedde with the Mint. They <a id="l114"></a>&amp; all the Queens subjects will have justice done them at the next trial of <a id="l115"></a>the Pix. And in the mean time  they are not to discourage <a id="l116"></a>the  importation of bullion into her Majestys Mint. But if they desire a hearing <a id="l117"></a>before the Queen &amp; Council, the Officers of the Mint  do not decline <a id="l118"></a>it.</p>
