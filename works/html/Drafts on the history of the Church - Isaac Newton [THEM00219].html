<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Chap. 2 <a id="l1"></a><br> Of the Prince of the host or Messiah the Prince &amp; of  his host composed of Iews &amp; Gentiles  united by charity.</h2>
<p id="par1" class="i0">1 <span class="hspac-n" title="4 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The God of the Iews &amp; Gentiles was one &amp; the same God <a id="l4"></a>the creator of heaven &amp; earth, &amp; the Christian religion was <a id="l5"></a>one &amp; the same with the Iewish till the calling of the Gen<a id="l6"></a>tiles, with this only addition that Iesus who was crucified <a id="l7"></a>under Pontius Pilate was  the Prince of the host or head of the Church the seed of the wo<a id="l8"></a>man which was to bruise the serpents head, the Shiloh <a id="l9"></a>who was to come before the scepter departed from Israel, <a id="l10"></a>the Prophet promised by Moses &amp; prefigured by the Paschal <a id="l11"></a>lamb, the holy David who was not to be left in the grave nor <a id="l12"></a>to see corruption, the servant of God who was wounded for our <a id="l13"></a>transgressions &amp; bruised for our iniquities &amp; brought as a lamb <a id="l14"></a>to the slaughter &amp; made an offering for sin,  &amp; the  <a id="l15"></a>Messiah or Christ the Prince predicted by Daniel (whence came the name of the <a id="l16"></a>Christian religion;) &amp; that he rose from the dead &amp;  shall judge the quick &amp; the dead; &amp; that we are <a id="l18"></a> to give him honour <a id="l20"></a>&amp; glory on account of his death &amp; to commemorate it often &amp; <a id="l21"></a>to direct our prayers to God in his name as our great high Priest <a id="l22"></a>the mediator between God &amp; man.  But when <a id="l23"></a>this doctrine had been preached to the nation of the Iews <a id="l24"></a>about seven years, &amp; they received it not, God began to <a id="l25"></a>call the Gentiles without obliging them to observe the <a id="l26"></a>law of Moses, &amp; soon after caused the Iewish worship <a id="l27"></a>to cease &amp; the Iews to be dispersed into all nations.</p>
<p id="par2">The street &amp; wall of Ierusalem were finished in the <a id="l28"></a>28<sup>th</sup> year of Artaxerxes Longimanus as above &amp; were  <a id="l29"></a>to continue 62 weeks of years in troublesome times <a id="l30"></a>untill the coming of the Messiah Dan. 9.25. And <a id="l31"></a>those weeks ended two or three years before the vulgar Æra. <a id="l32"></a> And at that time Iesus Christ the author of the <a id="l33"></a>christian religion was born.</p>
<p id="par3">The Messiah the Christ &amp; the Annointed are words <a id="l34"></a>of the same signification in several languages. He came <a id="l35"></a>to be the Messiah or the annointed Prince of the Iews <a id="l36"></a>but his kingdom was not of this world. ffor after  his <a id="l37"></a>first coming which was at the end of the 62 weeks, when <a id="l38"></a>he had preached the gospel to the Iews &amp; executed his <a id="l39"></a>fathers will, he was cut off &amp; the people rejected from <a id="l40"></a>being his &amp; the people of another Prince to come (the <a id="l41"></a>Romans) destroyed the city &amp; the sanctuary &amp; the end <a id="l42"></a>thereof was with a flood &amp; unto the end of the war <a id="l43"></a>desolations were made in the land</p>
<p id="par4">Yet he was annointed a king by his death &amp; re<a id="l44"></a>surrection, having thereby a name given him above every <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024r"> &lt;24r&gt; </span> name that at the name of Iesus every knee should bow <a id="l45"></a>&amp; he kept the covenant with many of his people for a <a id="l46"></a>week of years untill the calling of Cornelius &amp; the Gen<a id="l47"></a>tiles, by which the Iews ceased to be his peculiar people <a id="l48"></a>And in half a week of years  the desolator caused the sacrifice &amp; oblation to <a id="l50"></a>cease  &amp;  upon a wing of abominations overspread the land,  <a id="l51"></a>the made it desolate as it is at this day, &amp;  untill the <a id="l52"></a>consummation &amp;  time determined  it  shall continue upon the de<a id="l53"></a>solate,  even untill the commandment goes forth to cause to return <a id="l54"></a>&amp; to build Ierusalem, &amp; the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>
<p id="par5" class="i0">2 <span class="hspac-n" title="4 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Before this desolation the Iews continued a people <a id="l55"></a>&amp; holy city seventy weeks of years untill the finishing <a id="l56"></a>of transgression &amp; making an end of sins &amp; making <a id="l57"></a>a reconciliation for iniquity &amp; bringing in everlasting <a id="l58"></a>righteousness &amp; fulfilling the vision &amp; the prophesy &amp; <a id="l59"></a>annointing the most holy: that is, from the time of <a id="l60"></a>the incorporation of the Iews into a body politique or <a id="l61"></a>holy city untill the death of the Messiah &amp; his resur<a id="l62"></a>rection from the dead whereby he washed away our sins <a id="l63"></a>in his blood, reconciled us to God &amp; was annointed to be <a id="l64"></a>the Prince or king of the Iews. Now in the seventh <a id="l65"></a>year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, by the Kings commissi<a id="l66"></a>on granted to Ezra to set magistrates &amp; judges over the <a id="l67"></a>land with power to judge according to the law of God <a id="l68"></a>&amp; the king &amp; to punish by death or banishment or <a id="l69"></a>confiscation of goods or imprisonment, the Iews were <a id="l70"></a>incorporated into a polity &amp; became a people &amp; <a id="l71"></a>holy city. Seventy weeks of years counted from <a id="l72"></a>that period of time end in the year of the vulgar <a id="l73"></a>Æra 33 or 34 &amp; then was Iesus the Messiah slain <a id="l74"></a>&amp; raised from the dead &amp; the Christian religion be<a id="l75"></a>gan to be preached among the Iews &amp; seven years <a id="l76"></a>after among the Gentiles, who were thereby grafted <a id="l77"></a>into the stock of the Iews &amp; became Gods people <a id="l78"></a> or Church called by Daniel the host of heaven, &amp; persevered under the heathen Roman Emperors in various afflictions <a id="l79"></a>&amp; persecutions, the last of which was that vehement <a id="l80"></a>&amp; lasting persecution under the Emperors Dioclesian <a id="l81"></a>Galerius &amp; Maximinus, which ended in the conver<a id="l82"></a>sion of the Roman Empire to the Christian religion <a id="l83"></a>by the victories of Constantine the great over Max<a id="l84"></a>entius Maximinus &amp; Licinius in the years of our <a id="l85"></a>Lord 312, 314 &amp; 318.</p>
<p id="par6"><span class="ns">☉</span> Herod was made king by the Senate &amp;c</p>
<p id="par7">The law of the Iews &amp; Christians, except the cere<a id="l86"></a>monial part, was one &amp; the same law. <em class="underline">Thou shalt love <a id="l87"></a>the Lord thy God with all thy heart &amp; with all thy soul &amp; with all thy mind. This is the first &amp; great command<a id="l88"></a>ment, &amp; the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy <a id="l89"></a>neighbour as thy self. On these two commandments</em>, saith Christ, <em class="underline">hang all the law &amp; the Prophets.</em> Mat. 22.37. And on <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025r"> &lt;25r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">was unlike the things created by him &amp; in all things like the father</em>. And that <a id="l90"></a>this interpretation was entred in the Acts of the Council is manifest <a id="l91"></a>by what another Council which met at Antioch in the reign of <a id="l92"></a>Iovian A.C. 363 wrote to that Emperor. <sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>  <em class="underline">We approve</em>, say they, <a id="l93"></a><em class="underline">&amp; constantly retain the faith of the holy Synod heretofore <a id="l94"></a>assembled at Nice: since the word consubstantial which was <a id="l95"></a>used in that Council, &amp; to some seems new &amp; unusual, was</em> <a id="l96"></a>[there] <em class="underline">explained by the fathers with a cautious interpreta<a id="l97"></a>tion so as to signify that the Son was begotten of the substance <a id="l98"></a>of the father &amp; is like the father according to substance</em> <a id="l99"></a>Nicetas<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup>  tells us that some of the Nicene fathers in sub<a id="l100"></a>scribing the decrees of that Council wrote by way of ex<a id="l101"></a>planation that the Son was ὁμοιούσιος to the father. And <a id="l102"></a>that they did so is manifest by the Creed of the  <a id="l103"></a>Council of  Illyricum assembled in the reign of <a id="l104"></a>Valentinian &amp; Valens A.C. 373, in which they wrote thus. <sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> <em class="underline">We confess according to the great &amp; orthodox Synod <a id="l105"></a>that the Son is consubstantial to the father. Nor do we <a id="l106"></a>understand consubstantial in such a manner as some for<a id="l107"></a>merly expounded who did not subscribe sincerely &amp; according <a id="l108"></a> to the truth &amp; as others do now who call those men <a id="l109"></a>fathers, abolishing the force of this word, &amp; following the <a id="l110"></a>example of those who have written that the word signifies <a id="l111"></a>like, namely that the son is like none of the creatures <a id="l112"></a>which were made by him but bears the likeness of the <a id="l113"></a>father only. For they that thus expound it, impiously teach <a id="l114"></a>that the Son of God is an excellent creature</em>. Here this <a id="l115"></a>Council in their Creed allows that some fathers in the <a id="l116"></a>Council of Nice did interpret the Word ὁμοούσιος of <a id="l117"></a>such a similitude as Eusebius describes &amp; subscribed the <a id="l118"></a>Acts of that Council according to this interpretation, that <a id="l119"></a>is, by entring in their subscriptions that the Son was ὁμοιούσιος <a id="l120"></a>to the father &amp; ὅμοιος κατ᾽ ὀυσίαν. And the accusing <a id="l121"></a>these subscriptions as insincere strengthens the evidence <a id="l122"></a>that there were such subscriptions. They could not deny <a id="l123"></a>the fact &amp; therefore they accused it of insincerity tho <a id="l124"></a>the accusation reflects upon the Council it self who <a id="l125"></a>had allowed that interpretation, &amp; in whose presence &amp; by <a id="l126"></a>whose permission those subscriptions were made. They said <a id="l127"></a>in their Creed that the Son was begotten of the father <a id="l128"></a>that is of the substance of the father.

<p id="par8">The Greeks therefore for checking &amp; abolishing the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span> monousian faith which by the language of una substantia <a id="l158"></a>una usia &amp; una hypostasis had been spread in the west &amp; in <a id="l159"></a>Egypt &amp; was contrary to the Nicene faith &amp; by the eastern <a id="l160"></a>Churches accounted Sabellianism &amp; Paulinianism, &amp; Montanism, introduced the Acts of the Nicene Council against it, &amp; endeavoured <a id="l161"></a>in several Councils A.C. 357, 358, 359 &amp; 360 to abolish that <a id="l162"></a>language &amp; revive the ancient decree of the Council of Antioch <a id="l163"></a>against Paul of Samosat. And particularly in the Council <a id="l164"></a>of Constantinople A.C. 360 they decreed that the word <a id="l165"></a>hypostasis, or (as Theodoret writes) one hypostasis should not <a id="l166"></a>be named of the father  son &amp; holy Ghost. And hence<a id="l167"></a>forward the language of one hypostasis began to cease.</p>
<p id="par9">For in the reign of the Emperor Iulian A.C. 362, <a id="l168"></a>Athanasius &amp; about 14 or 16 other bishops most of Egypt returning <a id="l169"></a>from banishment &amp; meeting in Council at Alexandria agreed <a id="l170"></a>that the language of one usia &amp; one hypostasis should signi<a id="l171"></a>fy that the father &amp; son were one substance not in number <a id="l172"></a>but in nature only, &amp; that the language of three hypostases <a id="l173"></a>might be used to signify that the father son &amp; holy Ghost <a id="l174"></a>were three substances in number tho but one in nature. <a id="l175"></a>And further to free themselves from the imputation of sabellia<a id="l176"></a>nism &amp; Paulinianism for using the language of una usia they ana<a id="l177"></a>thematized those heresies, &amp; to free  those from the imputa<a id="l178"></a>tion of Arianism  who used  the language of three hypostases, they <a id="l179"></a>rejected as spurious a table of faith which had hitherto been handed <a id="l180"></a>about as the  faith of the Council of Serdica. ffor this Coun<a id="l181"></a>cil  of Serdica used the language of one hypostasis &amp; condem<a id="l182"></a>ned that of three as Arian.</p>
<p id="par10">Yet it was some years before the language of  one <a id="l183"></a>hypostases fully ceased. ffor <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span><span class="ns">♁</span><span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="ns">☉</span> Hitherto the words . . . . . . . . .<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 25v &gt; </span><span class="ns">☉</span> Hitherto the words ὀυσία ὑπόστασις &amp; substantia had been used in one &amp; the <a id="l184"></a>same sense, the proper sense of the words. ffor the Council of Nice in saying that <a id="l185"></a>the son was begotten of the father that is of the ὀυσία of the father, meant <a id="l186"></a>by ὀυσία not the common essence or nature of the father &amp; son but the <a id="l187"></a>proper substance or ὑπόστασις of the father. ffor at the end of their Creed <a id="l188"></a>they anathematize those that should say that the son was of another <a id="l189"></a>ὀυσία or ὑποστασις, meaning of another substance then that of the father. <a id="l190"></a>And hence it came to pass that in the language μιας ὀυσίς,  μιας ὑποστάσεως &amp; <a id="l191"></a>unius substantiæ,  which come from <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> the words ὀυσια  υποστασις  &amp; substantia were taken for the fathers substance as if the son was not only of the fathers substance but also had no other substance untill ~ ~   first Hilary &amp; then Athanasius  &amp; those with him for freeing <a id="l193"></a>their party from  the imputation of Sabellianism &amp; Montanism taught them  to change the signification <a id="l194"></a>of the words ὀυσία &amp; substantia &amp; use them to signify not the <a id="l195"></a>proper substance of a thing but the common nature species or kind <a id="l196"></a>of substance which  Hilary calls the essence of a thing, &amp; also  gave them leave to change the language of <a id="l197"></a>one hypostasis into that of three, so that ὁμοούσιος &amp; μιας ὀυσίας might no longer <a id="l198"></a>be taken for a single substance but only import the relation of <a id="l199"></a>the single substances of the father son &amp; holy ghost to one another. And this I take to be the original of using the words usia &amp; hypostasis in different senses.</p>
<p id="par11">Yet the language of one usia &amp; one hypostasis had taken such root <a id="l200"></a>that notwithstanding the great authority of Athanasius &amp; the Council of Alexandria , it <a id="l201"></a>was some years before  the language of one usia &amp; three hypostases could take place. For Epiphanius  fully ceased. <a id="l202"></a>For Epiphanius (who wrote in the reign of Valens)  tells us <a id="l203"></a><sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup>  that ὁμοούσιος signifies one hypostasis, <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup>  that it is the same thing <a id="l204"></a>to say  hypostasis &amp; usia, &amp; <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup>  that the Trinity are  της <a id="l205"></a>ἀυτης ὑποστάσεως of one hypostasis. And Paulinus bishop of <a id="l206"></a>Antioch with his party in the reign of Valens called the three <a id="l207"></a>persons one hypostasis &amp; were blamed for it by Basil in <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup>  his <a id="l208"></a>349 Epistle. And Athanasius himself &amp; a Council of 90 bishops of Egypt <a id="l209"></a>&amp; Libya in their Epistle to the Africans written about the year <a id="l210"></a>369 say that ὀυσία &amp; ὑπόστασις are words of the same signi<a id="l211"></a>fication. And Victorinus Afer <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup>  saith: Hoc esse Græce ὀυσίαν vel <a id="l212"></a>ὑπόστασιν dicunt quod nos uno nomine Latine substantiam <a id="l213"></a>dicimus. And Pope Liberius in his letter to Athanasius (if it <a id="l214"></a>be genuine) calls the three persons one hypostasis. And in the <a id="l215"></a>letter which  Pope Damasus &amp; the Council of Rome<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 26r resumes &gt; </span> in the letter which Pope Damasus &amp; the Council <a id="l216"></a>of Rome sent to the Council of Illyricum A.C. 373, the <a id="l217"></a>holy Ghost is said to be one hypostasis with the father &amp; son <a id="l218"></a>And Ierome about the year 377 coming into Syria &amp; being <a id="l219"></a>there pressed to use the language of three hypostases, he <a id="l220"></a>scrupled it as Arian &amp; for scrupling it was accounted an he<a id="l221"></a>retick, as you may see in his letters to Pope Damasus about <a id="l222"></a>this matter. <em class="underline">Quia vocabula</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">non ediscimus, hæ<a id="l223"></a>retici judicamur.

<p id="par12">The Council of Antioch A.C. 344 or 345 in a long <a id="l231"></a>declaration of their faith which they sent to the Latines, <a id="l232"></a>anathematized them who should say that the father son <a id="l233"></a>&amp; holy ghost were one thing &amp; one person &amp; declared that <a id="l234"></a>they were three. And the Council of Sirmium which <a id="l235"></a>condemned Photinus A.C. 351 repeated the anathema. This <a id="l236"></a>was done in opposition to Sabellianism which was then spread<a id="l237"></a>ing in the west. And hence I seem to gather that the <a id="l238"></a>language of three persons as well as that of one substance <a id="l239"></a>was already begun amongst the Latines. But the word <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027r"> &lt;27r&gt; </span> person being of an ambiguous signification, the Greeks to make <a id="l240"></a>it signify a substance &amp; not a mere power or form of a sub<a id="l241"></a>stance used the language of τρία πράγματα &amp; τρεις  ὑπο<a id="l242"></a>στάσεις three things &amp; three hypostases as well as that of <a id="l243"></a>  τρια πρόσοπα three persons. And hence arose that <a id="l244"></a>controversy about words which Athanasius composed in the <a id="l245"></a>little Council of Alexandria above mentioned, &amp; of which <a id="l246"></a>Gregory Nazianzen in his Oration upon Athanasius gives <a id="l247"></a>this account. There being, saith he, one usia &amp; three <a id="l248"></a>hypostases piously professed by us (for the one denotes <a id="l249"></a>the nature of the deity, &amp; the other the properties <a id="l250"></a>of the three) &amp; these being in like manner under<a id="l251"></a>stood by the Latines who by reason of the narrow<a id="l252"></a>ness of their language &amp; want of names, could not <a id="l253"></a>distinguish hypostases from usia: they therefore <a id="l254"></a>introduced the language of three persons least they <a id="l255"></a>should admit three usias. And what happened from thence? A thing very ridiculous or rather <a id="l256"></a>miserable. That light &amp; empty contention about <a id="l257"></a>the sound of words seemed to amount unto a <a id="l258"></a>difference of faith. Then was Sabellianism <a id="l259"></a>imputed to the language of three persons &amp; Aria<a id="l260"></a>nism to that of three hypostases: both which names <a id="l261"></a>were feigned by the parties contending for victory. And <a id="l262"></a>what followed? When something was ever added to <a id="l263"></a>the troubles (the troubles I say made by the contentiousness <a id="l264"></a>of parties) at length the ends of the earth were in <a id="l265"></a>danger of being broken together with the syllables. <a id="l266"></a>Therefore that blessed man [Athanasius], that man of God truly so <a id="l267"></a>called, that great dispenser of souls, seing &amp; hearing <a id="l268"></a>these things, did not think that such an absurd &amp; un<a id="l269"></a>reasonable section of the word should be neglected but <a id="l270"></a>he himself applied a medicine to the distemper. And <a id="l271"></a>what was that? Calling both parties  together <a id="l272"></a>before him with lenity &amp; mildness [in the said Council of Alexandria] &amp; accurately consi<a id="l273"></a>dering the sense &amp; meaning of their words: after he <a id="l274"></a>found them agreeing &amp; not at all differing in opinion he <a id="l275"></a>indulged them the use of their words &amp; bound them only <a id="l276"></a>by the things. Thus far Gregory. And henceforward the two <a id="l277"></a>contending parties began to allow one anothers language <a id="l278"></a>&amp; the Latines, that they might exclude the Sabellian <a id="l279"></a>signification of three persons invented the language of <a id="l280"></a>three subsistencies &amp; began also by degrees to use the language of <a id="l281"></a>three hypostases. And this I take to be the true original of <a id="l282"></a>the language of the Latine Empire which continues still in use, <a id="l283"></a>viz<sup>t</sup> una substantia &amp; tres personæ subsistentiæ &amp; hypostases.</p><span class="pagenumber" id="p027v"> &lt;27v&gt; </span>
<p id="par13">After the signification of ὀυσία &amp; substantia were changed &amp; the words <a id="l284"></a>were used as common names  denoting the  common nature <a id="l285"></a>of the divine persons, &amp; the language of one hypostasis  for avoiding <a id="l286"></a>the infamy of Sabellianism was changed into that of three, the  language <em class="underline">three  hypostases of one usia</em> &amp; three subsistencies or persons of one <a id="l288"></a>substance continued for many ages in the Churches of both Greeks &amp; Latines to  <a id="l289"></a> signify three intelligent substances of one essence,  nature or kind <a id="l290"></a>as has been  sufficiently shewed by Petavius, Curcelleus, Cudworth, <a id="l291"></a>Bull &amp; Hueteius. This appears plainly by the writings of Athanasius, <a id="l292"></a>Hilary, Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, Greg Nyssen, Ambrose, Ierome, Maxi<a id="l293"></a>mus the Martyr Chrysostom  Augustin Theodoret Leontius Byzantinus, <a id="l294"></a>Iohn Damascene, Theodorus Abucara, Euthymius Zygabenus, Theorianus, <a id="l295"></a> Manuel Calecas &amp;c. &amp;  also by the Acts of several Councils. The Council of Antoch A.C. <a id="l296"></a>363.</p>
<p id="par14">And again  to Epiphanius<sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup>  the bishop writ a little after the death of Athanasius suppose about the year 376 in mentioning the schism  between the  parties of <a id="l297"></a>Meletius &amp; Paulinus two contemporary bishops of Antioch &amp;  siding with the party <a id="l298"></a>of Meletius &amp; censuring that of   Paulinus he adds. That also pleases me that amongst other  decisions becoming a <a id="l299"></a>divine your  diligence has added that it is necessary to confess three hypostases <a id="l300"></a> that the brethren may have this who are at Antioch 1.

<p id="par15" class="i0">And in another Epistle <sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup> he saith, We  anathematise those  who hold that <a id="l325"></a>wicked opinion concerning the confusion of the hypostases, in which the most <a id="l326"></a>impious heresy of Sabellius is revived. which heresy can be no other then <a id="l327"></a>that of one hypostasis] Thus doth Basil tax the western Churches with hautines &amp; <a id="l328"></a>heresy in opposing  the Greeks as  they did formerly in the case of  Marcellus. And this heresy can be no other then that of their <a id="l330"></a>maintaining with Marcellus one hypostasis in the deity.  For this was the only article of <a id="l331"></a>faith  at this time in dispute between the Greeks &amp; Latines, &amp;  <a id="l332"></a>in defending Marcellus  a Sabellian was asserted by the Latines in the Council of Serdica &amp; was  by Basil accounted <a id="l333"></a>Sabellianism. So  in another Epistle it is to be understood that Basil taxes <a id="l334"></a>the Latines  in the west  as well as the party of Paulinus in the east with the <a id="l335"></a>same heresy where he saith <em class="underline">We anathematize those who hold that wicked <a id="l336"></a>opinion concerning the confusion of the hypostases, in which the most impious heresy <a id="l337"></a>of Sabellius is revived.</em> And this was the heresy of which the homousian Greeks accused <a id="l338"></a>Ierome. For Ierome …….. prædicabit. By all which it may be understood that <a id="l339"></a>the western Churches used the language of one hypostasis  from before the  first beginning of the reign of Theodosius <a id="l340"></a>the great &amp; were all this time accounted Sabellians &amp; Montanists by the Greeks notwithstanding the endeavour <a id="l341"></a> of Athanasius to reconcile the matter.</p><span class="pagenumber" id="p028v"> &lt;28v&gt; </span>
<p id="par16">The language of three hypostases was therefore difficultly received by the <a id="l342"></a>homousians because it imported three  substances. And yet for clearing <a id="l343"></a>themselves from the imputation of Sabellianism, they were at length forced to <a id="l344"></a>admit it. So Athanasius in his Exposition of the faith tells us that the <a id="l345"></a>Sabellians  making the father &amp; son μονοούσιον &amp; not ὁμοούσιον  do thereby take <a id="l346"></a>away the being of the  son. And Epiphanius that the son was not τατοούσιος to the <a id="l347"></a>father but ὁμοούσιος &amp; that the word ταυτοούσιος being used by some, draws <a id="l348"></a>to Sabellianism. And Basil that  it is <a id="l349"></a>not enough to  number the differences of persons but we <a id="l350"></a>must confess that every person subsists in a true hypostasis.  ffor <a id="l351"></a>Sabellius himself would not reject that figment of persons which have <a id="l352"></a>not singly their proper hypostases: seeing he said that the same God <a id="l353"></a>being one  as to  substance was upon every necessary <a id="l354"></a>occasion transformed &amp; spake sometimes as the father sometimes <a id="l355"></a>as the son &amp; sometimes as the holy ghost. Epist 64. p 859. And  <a id="l356"></a> again: What calumny can be more grievous . . . . nomina. And that <a id="l357"></a>Basil by hypostases means substances is evident. ffor he tells us that <a id="l358"></a>because the Son is the image of the father he is consubstantial <a id="l359"></a>to him;  that ὅμοιος κατ᾽ ουσίαν ἀπαραττες <a id="l360"></a>like according to substance with an invariable likenes is the same with <a id="l361"></a>ὁμοούσιος in the sense of the Nicene Council, that there is one ουσία of <a id="l362"></a>Peter &amp; Paul, &amp;  that the relation which a common name hath <a id="l363"></a>to a proper one that same relation  <span class="greek">ουσία</span> hath to ὑπόστασις.

<p id="par17">And in general Petavius Curcellæus D<sup>r</sup> Cudworth D<sup>r</sup> Bull &amp; Huetius <a id="l364"></a>have  shewn beyond all quæstion that  the three Hypostases were taken by the writers of the 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; following Centuries for three <a id="l366"></a>substances of one essence or nature [by  the writers of the <a id="l367"></a>fourth &amp;  following centuries.]  Athanasius, Hilary,  Epiphanius <a id="l368"></a>Bazil Gregory Nazianzen Gregory Nyssen, Chrysostom, Maximus  martyr, <a id="l369"></a>Theodoret, Cyril of Alexandria, Ambrose Ierome Austin, Leontius <a id="l370"></a>Byzantinus, Iohn Damascene, Theodorus Abucara, Euthymius Zygabius &amp; <a id="l371"></a>Theorianus Manuel Calecas are cleare in this matter &amp; so are several Councils. The <a id="l372"></a>Council of Antioch A.C. 363 say that the Council of Nice cautiously <a id="l373"></a>explained the consubstantiality of the son by his likeness to the father <a id="l374"></a>The third general Council decreed that the two hypostases of God &amp; man <a id="l375"></a>were united &amp; became one &amp; certainly the hypostasis of the man was a <a id="l376"></a>substance composed of body &amp; soul &amp; that united hypostasis of God &amp; man was also a substance. The fourth general Council said <a id="l377"></a>that Christ was consubstantial to the father as touching his godhead &amp; <a id="l378"></a>consubstantial to us as touching his manhood  &amp; in one &amp; the same short sentence consubstantial must have one &amp; the same signification..  And in the 18<sup>th</sup> &amp; 19<sup>th</sup> sessions of the Council <a id="l379"></a>of fflorence A.C. 1449 When Iohn bishop of Fonojulium in the name <a id="l380"></a>of the Latines had said [that  in divinity substantia is really the same with persona <a id="l381"></a>&amp; hypostasis but differs in the mode of conception,  a person consisting <a id="l382"></a>of  a substance &amp; its properties together, &amp; that substantia is communicated <a id="l383"></a>[<em class="underline">or</em> is common but  the properties not: Marcus bishop of Ephesus answers in the name of the Greeks that ουσια &amp; <a id="l384"></a>υποστασις differ as a  common name differs from a  proper one &amp; as the ουσια <a id="l385"></a>of a man taken in common  differs from the person <a id="l386"></a>&amp; hypostasis of a man; &amp; supposes that both parties agree in this notion. And in <a id="l387"></a>the 19<sup>th</sup> session of this Council 1, in explaining these things Marcus saith that a <a id="l388"></a>brother is non of  his brother hypostasis but of his nature as connatural &amp; <a id="l389"></a>ὁμοούσιος. And Andreas bishop of Rhoes that in the common Theology of the doctors <a id="l390"></a>of both Greeks &amp; Latines the divine substance differs from the substance of the father <a id="l391"></a>&amp; son, the divine  substance signifying what is common to the father son or holy ghost, &amp; the <a id="l392"></a> substance of the father signifying the person of the father. And in the rest <a id="l393"></a> of the debate both parties agree that ουσία substantia hath a double significa<a id="l394"></a>tion being taken sometimes for what is common as where the three persons are <a id="l395"></a>said to be of one ουσια and one substance, &amp; sometimes for what is proper and <a id="l396"></a>then it signifes the same thing with hypostasis &amp; person, as where the Nicene <a id="l397"></a>fathers said that the son is of the ουσία of the father &amp; not of another ουσία <a id="l398"></a>or ὑποστασις: &amp; that the common usia esence or nature is  <a id="l399"></a>understood to be divided into the persons,  when we say the ουσία of the fat<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>her, the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l400"></a>ουσια of the son &amp; the ουσια of the holy Ghost,  &amp; thereby mean <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>their<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l401"></a>proper hypostases or persons. So th<span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p028r"> &lt;28r&gt; </span>the  opinion of three  substances in number &amp; one in nature continued <a id="l402"></a>to be the doctrine of the Churches of both Greeks &amp; Latines till the times <a id="l403"></a>of the Council of Florence.  But yet the <a id="l408"></a> tautousian faith began to be revealed  <a id="l409"></a>among the Latines by the schoolmen &amp; to be  much spread  in the west before the times of this Council.  <a id="l410"></a>ffor  Peter Lombard the master of the sentences in the middle of the 12 century affirming: <em class="underline">Vnam et <a id="l411"></a>summam quandam rem est divinam essentiam</em> &amp; non dici <em class="underline">divinam <a id="l412"></a>essentiam genuisse essentiam ne eadem res seipsam genuerit</em> <a id="l413"></a> Ioachim the Abbot who held  three substances in the <a id="l414"></a>Deity, objected that Peter Lombard made  a quaternity in the Deity, the three hy<a id="l415"></a>postases &amp; the one divine essence. And the  <a id="l416"></a>Lateran Council A.C.  1215, declared against Ioachim that <a id="l417"></a> there was only a Trinity &amp; not a quaternity in God: <a id="l418"></a> every person  being that divine essence. ffor say they the father <a id="l419"></a>in generating gave his substance to the son, not a part of <a id="l420"></a>it so as to retain the remaining part to him self least the divine substance should be divisible, nor the <a id="l421"></a>whole so as not to retain it himself,  least he should <a id="l422"></a>cease to be a substance: but he gave them the whole so as to retain it also himself <a id="l423"></a>without diminution,  &amp; to have the same substance <a id="l424"></a>with the son. And so  the father &amp; son are one thing toge<a id="l425"></a>ther with the spirit.  This was the doctrine of the Council. And now the tautousian faith <a id="l427"></a>being   taught by the schoolmen &amp;  favoured by a Council of <a id="l428"></a>412 Bishops could not but  get grownd till it overspread the Latine Churches.</p>
<p id="par18">You have heard out of Hilary that the Bishops of the Churches of the <a id="l429"></a>Latines  neare the end of the reign of the Emperor <a id="l430"></a>Constantius  took the words unius substantiæ in <a id="l431"></a>four several  sences, three of which Hilary condemnes as impious <a id="l432"></a>&amp; the fourth  his own namely that the father &amp; son were two like &amp; <a id="l433"></a>equal substances called  one because of one nature essence &amp; <a id="l434"></a>species.  [And this opinion he explains a little after by <a id="l435"></a>saying una [substantia] ex similitudine, non ex solitudine &amp; again Quæ <a id="l436"></a>nihil differunt unium sunt non unione personæ se æqualitate naturæ <a id="l437"></a>&amp; again una [substantia non personæ unitate  seu generis. And again <a id="l438"></a>Quis enim sanæ mentis tertiam substantiam quæ et patri &amp; filio <a id="l439"></a>communis sit, prædicabit? Vel quis secundum Samosateum, in Christo <a id="l440"></a>renatus, &amp; filium confessus &amp; patrem: quod Christus in se sibi <a id="l441"></a>et pater &amp; filius sit, confitebitur? He means that is the father &amp; <a id="l442"></a>son have a common substance, that substance will be its own father &amp; <a id="l443"></a>its own son]  But there was another reason of the unity given by <a id="l444"></a>some for they said that the father son &amp; holy ghost were three <a id="l445"></a>cohering hypostases in one undivided substance. So Athanasius compared <a id="l446"></a>the father &amp; son to a fountain &amp; river which are undivided &amp; to the <a id="l447"></a>sun &amp; its ray which are unseparated &amp; Gregory Naz. compared the Trinity <a id="l448"></a>to three Suns which are joyned to one another &amp; intermix their rays <a id="l449"></a>And hence the trinity is usually said to be undivided. Now as three <a id="l450"></a> cohering parts of one undivided stone may properly be called <a id="l451"></a>one substance; so may three uniform cohering  spirits; but yet with this difference <a id="l452"></a>that the parts of a stone are in several places, but the spirits if infinite <a id="l453"></a>are all of them every where. Which manner of cohering &amp; being in <a id="l454"></a>one another the Greeks call περιχορησις &amp; the Latines circuminsessio <a id="l455"></a>words  which imply that the three persons are substances pervading <a id="l456"></a>one another.</p>

Such was the credit <a id="l848"></a>of this Council that Athanasius himself submitted to it, as you <a id="l849"></a>may see in his Exposition of faith where he saith of the son <a id="l850"></a> <sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup>  <em class="underline">I believe in  one only begotten  Word, Wisdom, <a id="l851"></a>son begotten of the father without beginning &amp; from <a id="l852"></a>eternity,</em> λόγον δὲ ὀυ προφόρικον  ὀυκ ἐνδιάθετον <a id="l853"></a>ὀυκ ἀπό᾽ρρ῾οιαν του τελείου, ου τμησιν της ἀπαθους <a id="l854"></a>φύσεως, ὀύτε προβολὴν, <em class="underline">the word not prolatitious <a id="l855"></a>not inherent, not an efflux of the perfect, not a <a id="l856"></a>section of the impassible nature, nor a projection</em>.</p>
<p id="par44">And thus by the universal approbation of the sentence <a id="l857"></a>of this Council against Photinus the growing opinion that the <a id="l858"></a>Word of God was his λόγος ἐνδιάθετος ἤ προφόρικος was at <a id="l859"></a>length universally exploded as erroneous &amp; worthy of an ana<a id="l860"></a>thema. And so was  the opinion in general that the son <a id="l861"></a>was generated by the emission efflux dilatation or projection <a id="l862"></a>of any part or power of the fathers substance.  Opinions <a id="l863"></a>of this kind were the foundation of the metaphysical theology of the heathens, Cabbalists, Gnosticks <a id="l864"></a>Montanists &amp; such like hereticks: &amp; therefore what we meet with <a id="l865"></a>of these opinions in Tatian, Athenagoras, Theophilus,  Tertullian, <a id="l866"></a>Clemens or any other writers of the first ages is to be looked <a id="l867"></a>upon as not derived from the Apostles by tradition but unwarily <a id="l868"></a>brought into the Church from the Theology of the heathens <a id="l869"></a>or Cabbalists in which learned men happened to be educated &amp; instructed before <a id="l870"></a>they became Christians, or from the Theology of the hereticks who <a id="l871"></a>by their emissaries endeavoured to corrupt the Church.  For In the second century there <a id="l872"></a> arose some Christians, as Iustin mentions, who taught that the Son &amp; <a id="l873"></a>holy ghost &amp; Angels were emissions of Gods powers!  Others, as Tatian, that they were parts of him <a id="l874"></a>Others  teaching creation out of nothing derived only the son &amp; holy Ghost from God by emission . And this opinion being more <a id="l876"></a>plausible as it got into the Church so it was taught in various manners by  the more refined hereticks Montanus, <a id="l877"></a>Noetus, Praxeas, Tertullian, Hermosenes, Sabellius, Paul of Samosat, Marcellus, <a id="l878"></a>Eustathius &amp; Photinus, but  was baffled by  the Councils which <a id="l879"></a>condemned the five last of them. And being baffled in the hereticks <a id="l880"></a>it was  relinquished by those in communion with the Church Catholick.</p>
<p id="par45">And  how dangerous this doctrine was you <a id="l881"></a>may know by the opinion which the major part of Christians  that is the Church catholick in <a id="l882"></a>the second century had  of it, who accounted it <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p039r"> &lt;39r&gt; </span> </p><span class="pagenumber" id="p038v"> &lt;38v&gt; </span>

<p id="par47" class="i0">afterwards go on to tell the story thus. <em class="underline">On the <a id="l896"></a>fift of the Calends of February we were watching</em> <a id="l897"></a>[all night] <em class="underline">in the Church, &amp; being at prayers <a id="l898"></a>because of the Assembly that was to meet on the <a id="l899"></a>Preparation, the Commandre Syrianus with <span class="large">many <a id="l900"></a>Legions</span> of soldiers having drawn swords &amp; other <a id="l901"></a>weapons, &amp; being armed with helmets &amp; other ar<a id="l902"></a>mour, suddenly set upon us while we were at <a id="l903"></a>prayers &amp; reading the scriptures, brake the doors <a id="l904"></a>&amp; some began to throw darts others cried an <a id="l905"></a>Alarm, so that there was made a great clashing <a id="l906"></a>of arms the drawn swords shining by candle <a id="l907"></a>light, &amp; Virgins were slain &amp; troden underfoot. <a id="l908"></a>And whilst their Leader marshalled his army, the <a id="l909"></a>Bishop sat in his throne &amp; exhorted all to prayers <a id="l910"></a>&amp; being thrust hither &amp; thither was almost pulled <a id="l911"></a>to pieces, &amp; when in a great deliquium he lay <a id="l912"></a>for dead &amp; now does not appear, we know not what is become of him</em>. A little after they further add that <em class="underline">the arms which were left in the <a id="l913"></a>Church by those who brake in &amp; which still hang <a id="l914"></a>up in the church, were no light argument of the <a id="l915"></a>hostile incursion so that they could not deny it. <a id="l916"></a>For Gorgonius the Governour of the City hath,</em> <a id="l917"></a>say they, <em class="underline">often sent a military Hangman with <a id="l918"></a>a Captain to take them down, but we would not <a id="l919"></a>suffer them that the thing may be known to all <a id="l920"></a>men</em>. Then they go on to say how that as they had <a id="l921"></a>already resisted unto blood so if it were the Empe<a id="l922"></a>ror's pleasure that they should be thus persecuted, <a id="l923"></a>they were all ready to suffer martyrdome, that is, <a id="l924"></a>to dye in that resistance.

<p id="par48">The City being thus inflamed by these incendiaries, <a id="l933"></a>there followed other boiles before it could be quieted <a id="l934"></a>of all which Lucifer Calaritanus in a railing book which <a id="l935"></a>he wrote against his Emperor Constantius, makes this <a id="l936"></a>mention. <sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup> Recordare Constanti de scelerum tuorum <a id="l937"></a>memoria recenti, quam tibi in civitate Alexandrinorum <a id="l938"></a>inussisti: quantos per abrupta una tincta subscripti<a id="l939"></a>onis tuæ dejecerit, quantos gladio demeti fecerit, <a id="l940"></a>quantos fame sitique exedi, vel carceribus necari, <a id="l941"></a>quantos intercepto effecerit spiritu strangulari: et <a id="l942"></a>tamen his omnibus crudelitatibus in sanctos mar<a id="l943"></a>tyres quos tuus interfecit gladiatorius animus, cùm <a id="l944"></a>sævieris; in nos crudelius sævis dum retines gladium.</p>
<p id="par49">Nor were these stirs of short continuance <a id="l945"></a>For Athanasius exclaiming against the proceedings of <a id="l946"></a>Constantius as a vehement persecution &amp; celebrating all <a id="l947"></a>those  as martyrs &amp; confessors who were slain or taken <a id="l948"></a>prisoners, plaid the trumpeter to the rebellion &amp; kept it <a id="l949"></a>up for a good while as you may understand by that <a id="l950"></a>railing book which Hilary wrote against his Emperor Con<a id="l951"></a>stantius, in which he has this passage. <em class="underline">Adest mecum <a id="l952"></a>Alexandria tot concussa bellis, tantum commotarum ex<a id="l953"></a>peditionum expavens tumultum.

<p id="par50" class="i0">In short the Egyptians were so seditious <a id="l986"></a>that afterwards when Valens would have ex<a id="l987"></a>pelled Athanasius he could not effect it but found <a id="l988"></a>it necessary to desist. For it was not Alexandria <a id="l989"></a>alone but all Egypt &amp; Libya which was inflamed <a id="l990"></a>by this sedition, the people with their Presby<a id="l991"></a>ters &amp; Bishops being every where stirred up <a id="l992"></a>by the above-mentioned Letter of the Alexandri<a id="l993"></a>ans &amp; getting into bodies in the field: whereupon <a id="l994"></a>at length followed a skirmish in the Wilderness <a id="l995"></a>like that nocturnal one at Alexandria, as <a id="l996"></a>Athanasius in his first Apology thus mentions. <a id="l997"></a><sup class="note" id="n27-ref">[27]</sup> <em class="underline">Whilst I was wondring</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">at these things <a id="l998"></a>behold there came again another grievous report <a id="l999"></a>concerning Egypt &amp; Libya: namely that almost <a id="l1000"></a>ninety Bishops were expelled &amp; their Churches <a id="l1001"></a>given to the Arians; sixteen of them being <a id="l1002"></a>banished &amp; the rest being partly put to flight <a id="l1003"></a>&amp; partly compelled to dissemble.

<p id="par51" class="i0">a horn in the same sense with the other ten Pictures &amp; images began before this time to be <a id="l1021"></a>set up in Churches but their worship was not yet <a id="l1022"></a>decreed. At length the Greek Emperor Philippicus a Mo<a id="l1023"></a>nothelite A.C. 712 caused the picture of the sixt gene<a id="l1024"></a>ral Council called against the Monothelites to be abolished. <a id="l1025"></a>And thereupon Pope Constantine calling a Synod at Rome <a id="l1026"></a>anathematized the Empreor, forbad setting up of his Images <a id="l1027"></a>set up in S<sup>t</sup> Peters Church the picture of the six <a id="l1028"></a>general Councils &amp;, as Sigonius relates, added another <a id="l1029"></a>decree whereby all who should deny to the holy Images <a id="l1030"></a>the veneration which was appointed to them by the Church <a id="l1031"></a>are damned. This was the first decree for the vene<a id="l1032"></a>ration of images. ffor hitherto they had been allowed <a id="l1033"></a>both in the eastern &amp; western churches only for in<a id="l1034"></a>structing the people in history.</p>
<p id="par52">The Emperor Leo Isaurus about ten years after called <a id="l1035"></a>a meeting of Counsellours &amp; Bishops in his palace for putting <a id="l1036"></a>a stop to the spreading of this worship &amp; by their advice <a id="l1037"></a>put out an edict against it &amp; wrote to Pope Gregory the 2<sup>d</sup> <a id="l1038"></a>that a general Council might be called. But the Pope <a id="l1039"></a>thereupon calling a Council at Rome A.C. 726 confirmed the worship <a id="l1040"></a>of images, excommunicated the Greek Emperor, absolved his <a id="l1041"></a>subjects in Italy from their obedience &amp; forbad them to pay <a id="l1042"></a>tribute to him &amp; thereby got the city Rome into his own hands &amp; caused a great part of the Exarchate <a id="l1043"></a>to revolt &amp; kill Paul the Exarch. And the Lombards also <a id="l1044"></a> being zealous for the worship of images &amp; pretending to <a id="l1045"></a>favour the cause of the Pope invaded the cities of the Ex<a id="l1046"></a>archate, </p>
<p id="par53">At length Pope Zechary A.C. 752 fearing the power of <a id="l1048"></a>the Lombards, deposed Childeric a sloathfull &amp; useless king <a id="l1049"></a>of ffrance &amp; the last of the race of Merovæus &amp; absolving <a id="l1050"></a>his subjects from their oath of allegiance gave the kingdom <a id="l1051"></a>to Pipin king of Austrasia &amp; Suevia for ever, hoping thereby to strength<a id="l1052"></a>en himself by making a new &amp; potent friend. And thus by <a id="l1053"></a>the conjunction of these two kingdoms did one of the ten <a id="l1054"></a>horns fall before the little horn. This was done in the <a id="l1055"></a>beginning of the year 752.</p>
<p id="par54">The same year in March this Pope died &amp; Stephen suc<a id="l1056"></a>ceeded &amp; before the end of the year the Lombards took Ra<a id="l1057"></a>venna &amp; put an end to the Exarchate. And this is the second <a id="l1058"></a>of the three kingdoms that fell.</p>
<p id="par55">Then Pope Stephen knowing better how to deal with <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p043r"> &lt;43r&gt; </span>  the Greek Emperor then with the Lombards went the next <a id="l1059"></a>year to their king to persuade him to return the Exar<a id="l1060"></a>chate to the Emperor, but  this not suc<a id="l1061"></a>ceeding he went into France &amp; perswaded Pipin to <a id="l1062"></a>take the Exarchate &amp; Pentapolis from the Lombards <a id="l1063"></a>&amp; give it to S<sup>t</sup> Peter. And accordingly Pippin A.C. 754 <a id="l1064"></a>came with an army into Italy &amp; made Aistulphus king <a id="l1065"></a>of the Lombards promise the surrender. But the next <a id="l1066"></a>year Aistulphus on the contrary to revenge himself <a id="l1067"></a>on the Pope beseiged the city of Rome. Whereupon <a id="l1068"></a>Pope Stephen sent letters to Pipin wherein he told him <a id="l1069"></a>that if he came not speeedily against the Lombards, <em class="underline">pro <a id="l1070"></a>data sibi potentia alienandum fore a regno Dei et <a id="l1071"></a>vita æterna</em>, he would excommunicate him as he had <a id="l1072"></a>done the Greek Emperor. Pipin therefore being devoted <a id="l1073"></a>to the church of Rome came speedily with an army into <a id="l1074"></a>Italy raised the siege besieged the Lombards in Papia <a id="l1075"></a>&amp; forced them to surrender the Exarchate &amp; region <a id="l1076"></a>of Pentapolis to the Pope for a perpetual possession. <a id="l1077"></a>And now Ravenna &amp; the rest of the Exarchate were surrendered some <a id="l1078"></a>few cities excepted &amp; the keys sent to Rome &amp; laid <a id="l1079"></a>upon the Confession of S<sup>t</sup> Peter, that is upon his <a id="l1080"></a>Tomb at the high altar <em class="underline">in signum veri perpetuique <a id="l1081"></a>dominij sed pietate Regis gratuita</em>, as the inscription of a coin of Pipin has it. This was in the year 755. And henceforward the <a id="l1082"></a>Popes left off in their Epistles &amp; Bulls to note the <a id="l1083"></a>years of the Greek Emperors as they had hitherto done. <a id="l1084"></a></p>
<p id="par56">Afterwards the Lombards invading the Popes countries, <a id="l1087"></a>Pope Adrian sent to Charles the great the son of Pipin <a id="l1088"></a>to come to his assistance, &amp; accordingly Charles entred <a id="l1089"></a>Italy with an army, invaded the Lombards, overthrew <a id="l1090"></a>their kingdom, took Desiderius their king prisoner, became <a id="l1091"></a>master of their countries &amp; restored to the Pope not <a id="l1092"></a>only what they had taken from him but also the rest <a id="l1093"></a>of the Exarchate which they had promised Pipin to re<a id="l1094"></a>store to the Pope but had hitherto deteined &amp; also gave him some cities of the Lombards. These things <a id="l1095"></a>were done in the years 773 &amp; 774. And now the Pope <a id="l1096"></a>being arived to his full temporal greatness &amp; freed from <a id="l1097"></a>the fear of his enemies did henceforward reign prosperously <a id="l1098"></a>with two Keys the keys of the cities of the two kingdoms in his hand in lieu of a scepter <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p044r"> &lt;44r&gt; </span> and a triple crown upon his head.</p>
<p id="par57">These crowns I take  to be in memory of his acquiring <a id="l1099"></a>his dominion by the grant of one king &amp; the  conquest of two others. <a id="l1100"></a>The primacy or first place in point of honour was allowed to the <a id="l1101"></a>sea of Rome &amp; the second &amp; third places to the seas of Alexan<a id="l1102"></a>dria &amp; Antioch before the time of the Council of Nice but <a id="l1103"></a>none of them were then acknowledged universal Bishops. In the <a id="l1104"></a>reign of Constantius the western Bishops to strengthen the autho<a id="l1105"></a>rity of the western Churches against the eastern laboured that <a id="l1106"></a>appeals should be made from all the world to the Pope, but did <a id="l1107"></a>not subject themselves to the Pope as universal Bishop over all <a id="l1108"></a>the western churches. When the western Empire became  <a id="l1109"></a>divided into ten kingdoms which at first were either heathen <a id="l1110"></a>or Arian, the Catholicks began to unite against them under the Pope &amp; <a id="l1111"></a>those kingdoms as fast as they were converted to the catholic <a id="l1112"></a>religion subjected themselves to the Popes authority in matters ec<a id="l1113"></a>clesiastical.  And <a id="l1115"></a>first Clodovæus king of ffrance being converted from the heathen <a id="l1116"></a>to the Catholic religion subjected his kingdom to the Pope &amp; by the <a id="l1117"></a>advice of Remigius Bishop of Rhemes sent to Pope Hormisda a <a id="l1118"></a>crown of gold adorned with gemms A.C. 514, &amp; the Pope in recom<a id="l1119"></a>pence made Remigius his deputy Bishop over all the churches <a id="l1120"></a>of the Francs.  And soon after by subverting the <a id="l1123"></a>kingdom of the Ostrogoths who were of a different religion &amp; <a id="l1124"></a>setting up the Catholic Exarchate in its room, &amp; by the submissi<a id="l1125"></a>on of the Greek Emperors  Iustinian &amp; Phocas who granted <a id="l1126"></a>to the Pope the universal Bishoprick over their dominions, this <a id="l1127"></a>spiritual crown became fixed on the Popes head, &amp; afterwards <a id="l1128"></a>by subverting the Exarchate &amp; the kingdom of the Lombards <a id="l1129"></a>the Pope gained also a temporal dominion, in memory of which <a id="l1130"></a>he has ever since carried two keys in his hand &amp; added two <a id="l1131"></a>temporal crowns to the spiritual one upon his head.</p>

MANES <em>neither called himself</em> <a id="l1162"></a>JESUS CHRIST, <em>nor the</em> HOLY GHOST. <em>What <a id="l1163"></a>Authority he assumed.</em></h2>
<p id="par65" class="i0"><sup class="note" id="n28-ref">[28]</sup> <span class="dropcap">T</span>HAT we may know, as clearly as we can at this Time, the <a id="l1164"></a><em>Manichean</em> System, we must before-hand explain the PRIN<a id="l1165"></a>CIPLES thereof. I call <em>Principles</em>, certain Propositions or <a id="l1166"></a>Maxims, which are, as it were, the Foundation of <em>Mancheism</em>, and <a id="l1167"></a>which were in some Manner peculiar to this Heresy.<a id="l1168"></a></p>
<p id="par66"><sup class="note" id="n29-ref">[29]</sup> I. <em>Manes</em> was not satisfied with appearing in the World, as a <a id="l1169"></a>great Philosopher, and in the Church, as a Christian Teacher. If <a id="l1170"></a>he had only taken one or the other of these two Characters, he would <a id="l1171"></a>have been subject either to the Holy Scripture, which is the common <a id="l1172"></a>Rule of Christians, or to Reason and Experience, which are the <a id="l1173"></a>Rules of Philosophers: He would have been obliged to prove his <a id="l1174"></a>Opinions, either by the Testimonies of the Sacred Books, or by <a id="l1175"></a>evident Reasonings. But not being able to do either one or the other, <a id="l1176"></a>he forged a Divine Mission, and took upon himself the Character <a id="l1177"></a>and the Authority of an <em>Apostle</em> of <em>Jesus Christ</em>, even the Authority of <a id="l1178"></a>an Apostle superior by his Divine Knowledge to the first Apostles, <a id="l1179"></a>and extraordinarily instructed by the Holy Ghost, in order to reveal <a id="l1180"></a>to Men Truths, which were unknown before his Ministry, and to <a id="l1181"></a>reform all established Religions. This was his First Principle.</p>
<p id="par67"><sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup> THE Second Principle, which we may consider as a Consequence <a id="l1182"></a>of the first, is, that tho' he received a great Part of the Writings of <a id="l1183"></a>the New Testament, yet it was only so far as they agreed with his <a id="l1184"></a>pretended Revelations, and his erroneous Science, In other Respects, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p048v"> &lt;48v&gt; </span>   he undertook to prove the Gospels to be false, affirming that they <a id="l1185"></a>were not the works of the <em>Disciples</em> of <em>Jesus Christ</em>, or that they <a id="l1186"></a>were adulterated. as for the Old Testament, he considered it as a <a id="l1187"></a>Collection of Books, composed by <em>Hebrews</em>, and for the Use only of <a id="l1188"></a>the <em>Hebrews</em>, stuffed with Precepts unworthy of the Deity, with <a id="l1189"></a>Fables and <em>Jewish</em> Superstitions.<a id="l1190"></a></p>
<p id="par68"><sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup> THE Third Principle of <em>Manes</em>, is, that all the Nations of the <a id="l1191"></a>World, and especially the <em>Eastern Nations</em>, have had their wise Men<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>,<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l1192"></a>their Philosophers, their Prophets, <em>&amp;c</em>. who by the Light commu<a id="l1193"></a>nicated by Divine Reason, to all who would attend to it, have <a id="l1194"></a>discovered Truths, which the <em>Jews</em> were ignorant of: That these <a id="l1195"></a>wise Men and these Prophets being the Fathers of the Gentiles, of <a id="l1196"></a>whom the Christian Church was composed, it is more natural and <a id="l1197"></a>more reasonable to consult them, than the Prophets of the <em>Jews:</em> <a id="l1198"></a>That those few moral Truths, which are to be found in the <em>Jewish</em> <a id="l1199"></a>Religion, did not come originally from these Prophets, but from <a id="l1200"></a>the first Parents of Mankind, who lived and dies in the <em>East</em>, who had <a id="l1201"></a>them from good Angels, and transmitted them to their Posterity.</p>
<p id="par69"><sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup> <em>In fine</em>, the Fourth Principle of <em>Manes</em> is, that the Sacred Books, <a id="l1202"></a>received by the Orthodox, being neither true, nor authentical, ought <a id="l1203"></a>to be corrected by the other Books, which they had rejected, only <a id="l1204"></a>because they did not agree with their Errors. From thence came <a id="l1205"></a>many Apocryphal Books, which the <em>Manicheans</em> opposed to the <em>Cano<a id="l1206"></a>nical</em> ones, and in which, they pretended, the true Doctrines of the <a id="l1207"></a>Apostles were contained.</p>
<p id="par70">THE fundamental Maxim of the <em>Manicheans</em> is in general, that <a id="l1208"></a>we ought to acknowledge as a Truth, neither Fact, nor Opinion, <a id="l1209"></a>under whatsoever Name it may be declared, and in whatsoever Book <a id="l1210"></a>it may be contained, except it agrees with the Doctrine of <em>Manes</em>, <a id="l1211"></a>who is <sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup> <em>a spiritual Man, who judges all Things, and cannot be judged <a id="l1212"></a>by any Man.</em> The Reason thereof is, that being immediately en <a id="l1213"></a>lightened, and directed by the <em>Paraclet</em>, promised and sent by Jesus <a id="l1214"></a>Christ, he knew and revealed all truths, and corrected all Errors.</p>
<p id="par71"> <sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> THESE are the Principles of the <em>Manicheans</em>, which I am going <a id="l1215"></a>to examine. I shall inquire I. What Idea this Heresiarch had a <a id="l1216"></a>Mind to give the World of his Person and Ministry : II. What He, <a id="l1217"></a>or at least his Followers, thought of the Old and the New Testa- </p>
