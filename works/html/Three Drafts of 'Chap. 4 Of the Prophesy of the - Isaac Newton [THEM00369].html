<p id="par2">1 The vision of the image composed of four metalls was given first to Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l2"></a>&amp; then to Daniel in a dream.

That of the Ram &amp; He Goat appeared to him in the day time when he was by the bank <a id="l4"></a>of the river Vlay, &amp; was explained to him by the prophetic Angel Gabriel. It concerns the Prince of the host &amp; the Prince of Princes. And  now in <a id="l5"></a>the first year of Darius the Mede over Babylon the same prophetic Angel appears to  Daniel again &amp; explains <a id="l6"></a>to him what is meant by the Prince of the host &amp; the Prince of princes. 3 <em class="underline">Seventy weeks</em> <a id="l7"></a> <em class="underline">are allotted upon thy people &amp; upon thy holy city</em>.

Seventy weeks are allotted <a id="l14"></a><em class="underline">to finish transgression &amp; make an end of sins &amp; to make reconciliation for iniquity &amp; to bring <a id="l15"></a>in everlasting righteousness &amp; to seal up the vision &amp; the prophet &amp; to annoint the most holy</em>. <a id="l16"></a> All which was accomplished by the death of Iesus Christ.

<p id="par4">2 This Prophesy like  the rest of Daniel's Prophesies consists of two parts, an introductory prophesy <a id="l37"></a>&amp; an Interpretation.

<p id="par7">2 This prophesy like all the rest of Daniel's Prophesies consists of two parts: an introducto<a id="l40"></a><br>ry prophesy &amp; an interpretation. The Prophesy is of the two comings of Christ, the first to be <a id="l41"></a>annointed at the end of 70 weeks, the second to reign at the end of seven weeks. The interpreta<a id="l42"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>tion<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> is to explain the different state &amp; circumstances of the times which precede &amp; accompany the two comings. <a id="l43"></a>whereby they may be known from one another. The Prophesy is this</p>
<p id="par8">Seventy weeks are allotted – All which was accomplished by the death of Iesus Christ at the end of seventy <a id="l44"></a>weeks [of years or 490 years counted from the seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus.] <a id="l45"></a>counting seven years to a week as is done in Gen. XXIX.27, 28. For from the  7<sup>th</sup> year of Artax<a id="l46"></a><br>erxes Longimanus to the death of Christ were just 490 years. From the Hebrew word <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> which signifies <a id="l47"></a><em class="underline">annoint</em>, the most holy who is annointed is in the next words called the Messiah the Prince <a id="l48"></a>Know also &amp; understand – – – shall be seven weeks. This is the  prophesy of the two <a id="l49"></a>comings of Christ. And the interpretation for distinguishing the two comings is as follows.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span>
<p id="par9">1 The vision of the  Image  composed of four metalls was given first to Nebuchad<a id="l50"></a>nezzar &amp; then to Daniel in a dream &amp; thereby Daniel  grew famous for revealing of secrets <a id="l51"></a>Ezek. XXVIII.3.  The vision of the four Beasts was also given to Daniel in a dream, &amp; therein is <a id="l52"></a>added to the former  prophesy the vision of the eleventh horn with eys &amp; a mouth reigning till the day of judgment &amp; the vision of the  day of judgment &amp; of one like the son of man <a id="l53"></a>coming in the clouds of heaven to the ancient of days &amp; receiving  dominion &amp; glory <a id="l54"></a>&amp; a kingdom that all people nations &amp; languages should serve him. The vision of the Ram &amp; He <a id="l55"></a>Goat  appeared to Daniel in the day time when he was  by the bank of the river Vlay, &amp; was <a id="l56"></a>explained to him by the prophetic Angel Gabriel. And therein is added to the former prophesies <a id="l57"></a>that of the last horn of the Goat  rising up &amp; magnifying himself against the Prince of the <a id="l58"></a>host &amp; the Prince of princes  &amp; taking away the daily sacrifice &amp; casting down the place <a id="l59"></a>of his sanctuary in the beginning of the 2300 prophetic days. And now follows the profesy of  Daniels weeks   for settling times when the horn should rise up against the prince of the <a id="l61"></a>host, &amp; take away the daily sacrifice &amp; cast down the sanctuary, &amp;  when the son of man should <a id="l62"></a>come in the clouds of heaven to receive a kingdom from the ancient of days.</p>
<p id="par10">Seventy weeks are allotted – – – mentioned in the preceding prophesy.</p>
<p id="par11"><em class="underline">Know also &amp; understand that</em> [after the long &amp; final captivity of the Iews] <em class="underline">from the going <a id="l63"></a>forth of the commandment to restore &amp; to build Ierusalem unto</em> [the coming of him that was <a id="l64"></a>annointed] <em class="underline">the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks</em>. This is  the coming of him that <a id="l65"></a>was annointed to reign as prince, the coming of the son of man in the clouds of heaven to <a id="l66"></a>ancient of days to  receive a kingdom that all  people nations &amp; languages should <a id="l67"></a>serve him.</p>
<p id="par12">All Daniels prophesies consist of two parts, a prophesy &amp; an interpretation. And the inter<a id="l68"></a><br>pretation is for explaining the prophesy &amp; supplying its defects. You have heard the prophesy <a id="l69"></a>concerning the two comings of Christs, &amp; the interpretation for distinguishing them &amp; supplying <a id="l70"></a>what is further wanting  to understand them, is as follows.</p>
<p id="par13"><em class="underline">Also threescore &amp; two weeks</em> [unto his first coming] <em class="underline"> the city shall be built &amp; the wall <a id="l71"></a>but this</em> [not in prosperous times as in the seven weeks, but] <em class="underline">in troublesome times.</em> <a id="l72"></a>– – – – – – – at the end of seven weeks to reign as prince.]</p>

<div><h2 id="hd2" class="cent">Chap.  3 <a id="l73"></a><br>Of the Prophesy of the seventy weeks.</h2><br><br>
<p id="par14">The vision of the image composed of four metalls was given first <a id="l74"></a>to Nebuchadnezzar &amp; then to Daniel in a dream. And Daniel began then to be celebrated for revealing of secrets. Ezek. 28. 3. The vision of the four Beasts <a id="l75"></a>was also given to Daniel in a dream.  That of the Ram &amp; Hee Goat appeared <a id="l76"></a>to him in the day time when he was by the bank of the river Vlay, &amp; was <a id="l77"></a>explained to him by the prophetic Angel Gabriel. It concerns the Prince of <a id="l78"></a>the host &amp; the Prince of Princes. And now in the first year of Darius the Mede <a id="l79"></a>over Babylon, the same prophetick Angel appears to Daniel again &amp; explains <a id="l80"></a>to him what is meant by the Prince of the host &amp; the Prince of Princes. This <a id="l81"></a>prophesy like all the rest of Daniels prophesies consists of two parts, an <a id="l82"></a>introductory prophesy &amp; an interpretation thereof. The prophesy  begins <a id="l83"></a>thus, <em class="underline">Seventy weeks are allotted upon thy people &amp; upon thy holy city</em> &amp;c. These <a id="l84"></a>are to be dated from the time that the Iews, after their government was dis<a id="l85"></a>solved by the Babylonian captivity, began to be reunited into a body politick <a id="l86"></a>so as to become again a people &amp; a holy city; &amp; this was in the seventh <a id="l87"></a>year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, the year in which Ezra came to Ieru<a id="l88"></a>salem with a commission from the king to set up magistrates &amp; judges to <a id="l89"></a>judge the people who know the laws of God, &amp; to teach those that know them <a id="l90"></a>not, &amp; to punish offenders against the laws of God &amp; the king with death <a id="l91"></a>or banishment or confiscation of goods, or imprisonment. Seventy weeks <a id="l92"></a>are allotted upon them <em class="underline">to finish transgression &amp; make an end of sins &amp; <a id="l93"></a>to make reconciliation for iniquity &amp; to bring in everlasting righteousness <a id="l94"></a>&amp; to seal up the vision &amp; the prophesy &amp; to annoint the most holy</em>. All which <a id="l95"></a>was accomplished by the death of Iesus Christ. And from the seventh <a id="l96"></a>year of Artaxerxes Longimanus to the death of Iesus Christ were 490 years, <a id="l97"></a>that is, just seventy weeks,  recconing seven years to a week, as is <a id="l98"></a>done in Gen. XXIX.27, 28. From the hebrew word Messiah which signifies annointed, <a id="l99"></a>the most holy who is annointed, is in the next words called the Messiah the <a id="l100"></a>Prince; &amp; this is the Prince of the host &amp; the Prince of princes mentioned <a id="l101"></a>in the preceding prophesy. <em class="underline">Know also &amp; understand that</em> [after his annointing <a id="l102"></a>&amp; a long captivity to follow it] <em class="underline">from the going forth of the commandment <a id="l103"></a>to restore &amp; to build Ierusalem unto</em> [the  coming of] <em class="underline">the <a id="l104"></a>Messiah</em> [to reign as] <em class="underline">the Prince, shall be seven weeks</em>. This is the prophesy, concerning the coming of Christ <a id="l105"></a>first to be annointed <a id="l106"></a>&amp; then to reign. <a id="l107"></a>&amp; the interpretation distinguishes those two comings &amp; is as follows.</p>

<span class="pagenumber" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> <h2 id="hd3" class="cent">Chap. IV <a id="l129"></a><br>Of the Prophesy of the seventy weeks.</h2>
<p id="par16">The vision of the image composed of four metalls was given to Da<a id="l130"></a>niel in a dream &amp; thereby Daniel grew famous in his life time for revealing <a id="l131"></a>of secrets, Ezek. XXVIII.3. The vision of the four Beasts was also given to <a id="l132"></a>Daniel in a dream, &amp; therein is added to the former prophesy the vision of <a id="l133"></a>the day of judgment &amp; of one like the son of man coming in the clouds of <a id="l134"></a>heaven to the ancient of days &amp; receiving dominion &amp; glory &amp; a kingdom <a id="l135"></a>that all people nations &amp; languages should serve him. The vision of <a id="l136"></a>the Ram &amp; He-goat appeared to Daniel in the day time, when he was by <a id="l137"></a>the bank of the river Vlay, &amp; was explained to him by the prophetic Angel <a id="l138"></a>Gabriel. And therein is added to the former prophesies that of the last <a id="l139"></a>horn of the Goat rising up &amp; magnifying himself against the prince of <a id="l140"></a>the host &amp; the prince of princes &amp; taking away the daily sacrifice &amp; cast<a id="l141"></a>ing down the place of his sanctuary at the beginning of the 2300 pro<a id="l142"></a>phetic days. And now follows the  prophesy of Daniels weeks for <a id="l143"></a>setling the times when the last horn of the Goat should rise up against <a id="l144"></a>the prince of the host &amp; take away the daily sacrifice &amp; cast down <a id="l145"></a>down the sanctuary, &amp; when the son of man should come in the clouds <a id="l146"></a>of heaven to receive his kingdom from the ancient days sitting in judgment.</p>
<p id="par17"><em class="underline">Seventy weeks are allotted upon thy people &amp; upon thy holy city</em>. <a id="l147"></a>These weeks are therefore to be dated from the time that the Iews, after <a id="l148"></a>their government was dissolved by the Babylonian captivity began to <a id="l149"></a>be reunited into a body politique so as to become again a people &amp; a holy <a id="l150"></a>city. And this was in the seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, the year <a id="l151"></a>in which Ezra came to Ierusalem with a commission from the king to set up <a id="l152"></a>magistrates &amp; judges to judge the people who know the laws of God, &amp; to teach <a id="l153"></a>those who know them not, &amp; to punish offenders against the laws of God &amp; <a id="l154"></a>the king with death or banishment or confiscation of goods or imprisonment. <a id="l155"></a>Seventy weeks are allotted – to finish transgression &amp; make an end of <a id="l156"></a>sins, &amp; to make reconciliation for iniquity, &amp; to bring in everlasting righte<a id="l157"></a>ousness, &amp; to seale up the vision &amp; the prophesy &amp; to annoint the most Holy. <a id="l158"></a>All which was accomplished by the death of Iesus Christ. And from the <a id="l159"></a>seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus to the death of Iesus Christ was <a id="l160"></a>490 years, that is, seventy weeks recconing seven years to a week as is <a id="l161"></a>done in Gen. 29.27, 28. For Daniel every where puts days for yeares. From <a id="l162"></a>the Hebrew word <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> which signifies <em class="underline">annoint</em>, the most Holy <a id="l163"></a>who is annointed, is in the next words called the Messiah the prince. And <a id="l164"></a>this is the Prince of the host &amp; the Prince of princes mentioned in the <a id="l165"></a>preceding prophesy.</p>
<p id="par18"><em class="underline">Know also &amp; understand that</em> [after the long &amp; final captivity of <a id="l166"></a>the Iews] <em class="underline">from the going forth of the commandment to restore &amp; to build <a id="l167"></a>Ierusalem, unto</em> [the coming of him that was annointed,] <em class="underline">the Messiah <a id="l168"></a>the Prince shall be seven weeks</em>. This is the coming of him that <a id="l169"></a>was annointed to reign as prince, the coming of the son of man in the <a id="l170"></a>clouds of heaven to the ancient of days to receive a kingdom that all <a id="l171"></a>people nations &amp; languages should serve him.</p>
<p id="par19">All Daniels prophesies consist of two parts, a prophesy &amp; an in<a id="l172"></a>terpretation. And the interpretation is for explaining the prophesy &amp; sup<a id="l173"></a>plying its defects. You have heard the prophesy concerning the two <a id="l174"></a>comings of Christ: &amp; the interpretation for distinguishing them &amp; supply<a id="l175"></a>ing what is further wanting to understand them, is as follows.</p>
<p id="par20"><em class="underline">Also threescore &amp; two weeks</em> [unto the first coming of Christ] <em class="underline">the <a id="l176"></a>city shall be built &amp; the wall, but this</em> [not in prosperous times as in the <a id="l177"></a>seven weeks, but] <em class="underline">in troublesome times:</em> viz<sup>t</sup> from the 28<sup>th</sup> year of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> Artaxerxes Longimanus in which the wall of Ierusalem was finished <a id="l178"></a>according to Iosephus, unto the birth of Christ.] <em class="underline">And after</em> [his com<a id="l179"></a>ming at the end of] <em class="underline">the threscore &amp; two weeks, the Messiah shall be <a id="l180"></a>cut off, &amp; not reign over them, but the people of a Prince to come</em> <a id="l181"></a>[the Romans] <em class="underline">shall destroy the city &amp; the sanctuary, &amp; the end thereof <a id="l182"></a>shall be with a flood. And unto the end of the war</em> [in the reign <a id="l183"></a>of Nero Vespasian &amp; Adrian] <em class="underline">desolations are determined. Yet he <a id="l184"></a>shall keep the covenant</em> [that of the Iews being Gods peculiar people,] <a id="l185"></a><em class="underline">with many for one week</em> [vizt with the Christian Iews till the <a id="l186"></a>calling of Cornelius &amp; the Gentiles, which was seven years after <a id="l187"></a>his death &amp; resurrection] <em class="underline">&amp; in half a week</em> [by the war of Nero &amp; Vespatian] <em class="underline">he shall cause the sa<a id="l188"></a>crifice &amp; the oblation to cease, &amp; with the overspreading of abominations</em> <a id="l189"></a>[the Iews being banished from Iudea &amp; the land being given to the <a id="l190"></a>heathens in the days of Adrian] <em class="underline">he shall make it desolate even <a id="l191"></a>untill the consummation &amp; that which is determined be poured <a id="l192"></a>upon the desolate</em>; that is, during the two thousand &amp; three hundred <a id="l193"></a>years. And then shall the sanctuary be cleansed, &amp; the Messiah shall <a id="l194"></a>come at the end of the seven weeks to reign as prince.</p>
