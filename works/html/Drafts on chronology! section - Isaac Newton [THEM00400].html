<h2 id="hd1" class="cent"><span class="large">Chap III.</span><a id="l1"></a><br>The Monarchy of Egypt<a id="l2"></a><br>at Thebes</h2>

<p id="par2">Manetho in his 11<sup>th</sup> &amp; 12<sup>th</sup> Dynasties, as he is cited by Afri<a id="l3"></a>canus &amp; Eusebius names these four kings of Thebes as reigning in order, <a id="l4"></a>Ammenemes, Gesongoses or Sesonchoris the son of Ammenemes, Amme<a id="l5"></a>nemes who was slain by his Eunuchs &amp; Sesostris who subdued all <a id="l6"></a>Asia &amp; part of Europe. Gesongoses &amp; Sesonchoris  seem corruptly written <a id="l7"></a>for Sesonchosis &amp; the two first of these four kings Ammenemes <a id="l8"></a>Sesonchosis are the same with the two last Ammenemes &amp; <a id="l9"></a>Sesostris.  that is with Ammon and Sesak. For we have shewed that  Sesonchosis, Sesostris &amp; Sesak are the same.</p>
<p id="par3"> As Manetho here repeats the same kings, so he does in several other <a id="l13"></a>Dynasties &amp; particular in his 18<sup>th</sup> Dynasty<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> where he names the kings who <a id="l14"></a>reigned at Thebes from the time of the expulsion of the shepherds down to Orus <a id="l15"></a>First he tells us that after the shepherds went out of  Egypt <a id="l16"></a>into Iudea Tethmosis or Amosis who expelled them reigned 25 years &amp; <a id="l17"></a>4 months &amp; then was succeeded by his  son Chebron after <a id="l18"></a>whom reigned Amenophis &amp; his sister Amesses. Then returning back he <a id="l19"></a>names Mephres, Mephramuthosis, Thmosis or Tuthmosis, Ameno<a id="l20"></a>phis &amp; Orus as reigning successively &amp; subjoyns some other Princes <a id="l21"></a>of Egypt contemporary to Orus  as Acencheres, the  daughter &amp; Rathoris <a id="l22"></a>the brother of Orus &amp; Armais or Danaus the  brother of Sesostris. The name Acerycheres he sets down thrice. And then <a id="l23"></a>again returning back he names in order Armesses Miamun or <a id="l24"></a>Ramesses, &amp; his son &amp; successor Amenophis &amp; &amp; his son &amp; successor <a id="l25"></a>Sethosis  who left his brother  Armais or Danaus governour of Egypt  <a id="l26"></a>while he himself invaded Cyprus Phenicia &amp; all the east.

<p id="par4">The first king Tethmosis or Amosis who expelled the Shepherds <a id="l29"></a>is plainly the same with Thmosis Thomosis or Tuthmosis whose <a id="l30"></a>Predecessor Misphragmuthosis shut them up in Abaris, &amp; there<a id="l31"></a>fore the first Amenophis who succeeded Tethmosis &amp; Chebron <a id="l32"></a>is the same with the second Amenophis who succeeded Thmosis <a id="l33"></a>And I take the third Amenophis to be still the same &amp; his <a id="l34"></a>predecessor Armesses Ramesses or Ammeses to be the same with <a id="l35"></a>their predecessors Amosis Thomosis or Tethmosis, such repetiti<a id="l36"></a>ons being frequent with Manetho. And so by comparing all these <a id="l37"></a>successions of kings together they seem to me to be but several <a id="l38"></a>repetitions of  the same race of kings succeeding in this <a id="l39"></a>order.</p>
<p id="par5">1 Mephres, Misaphris or Miphris.</p>
<p id="par6">2 Méphramuthosis, Mispharmuthosis, Misphragmuthosis, Alisphrag<a id="l40"></a>muthosis. He shut up the shepherds in Abaris.</p>
<p id="par7">3 Tethmosis, Thmosis, Thomosis, Amosis, Ammeses, Ar<a id="l41"></a>messes, Rammeses, Rameses, Ramesses. He obliged the sheperds <a id="l42"></a>to depart out of Egypt &amp; thereby became the first king of all Egypt.</p>
<p id="par8">4 Chebron or Chebros if he be rightly inserted.</p>
<p id="par9">5 Amenophis, Amenophthis, Menophis, Mnevis, Amme<a id="l43"></a>noph, Amenemes, that is Ammon the father of Sesostris. He carried the arms of Egypt into forreign countries &amp; subdued the <a id="l44"></a>Troglodites &amp; all Ammonia, &amp; from him Thebes was called <a id="l45"></a>No-Ammon the city of Ammon. </p>
<p id="par10">6 Sethos, Sethosis, Gesongoses, Sesonchoris, Sesonchosis, <a id="l46"></a>Sesostris, who is also called Sesoostris, Sesoosis, Sessosis, <a id="l47"></a>Sesochris, Sesonchis, Sasyches &amp; in Scripture Sesak.</p>
<p id="par11">7 Orus or Horus.</p>
<p id="par12">Tethmosis  according to Manetho  <a id="l48"></a>reigned after the expulsion of the Shepherds  25 years <a id="l49"></a>&amp; 4 months &amp;  Chebron 13 years <a id="l50"></a>more if he is duly inserted &amp; according to his recconing, if the sheperds <a id="l51"></a>were expelled between the 20<sup>th</sup> year of Samuel &amp; first <a id="l52"></a>year of Saul as above, &amp; Saul reigned about 10 years, the reign of Ammon will be<a id="l53"></a>gin after the 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; before the 29<sup>th</sup> year of David &amp; <a id="l54"></a>thus the reign of his son Sethosis   being one generation later is coincident to that of <a id="l55"></a>Sesak as above.</p>
<p id="par13">When David smote Edom<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> which was about the tenth or 12<sup>th</sup> year of David as above the king of Edoms servants <a id="l56"></a>fled into Egypt with Hadad a little child of the kings seed <a id="l57"></a>&amp;  Pharaoh gave Hadad a house &amp; victuals &amp; land <a id="l58"></a>&amp; Hadad  found great favour in the sight <a id="l59"></a>of Pharaoh so that he gave him to wife the sister of <a id="l60"></a>his own wife Taphenes the Queen. And the sister of Ta<a id="l61"></a>phenus bare him Genubath &amp; Genubath was in Pharaohs <a id="l62"></a>house among the Sons of Pharaoh untill the death of David. <a id="l63"></a>Whence it appears that this king of Egypt was of about <a id="l64"></a>the same age with Hadad &amp; began his reign young &amp; at <a id="l65"></a>the death of David had a family of young children <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span>
contemporary to Genubath. Amongst these children I reccon <a id="l66"></a>Solomon' young spouse<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> the chief (or firstborn) of her mother's <a id="l67"></a>children, &amp; her little sister who by reason of her child<a id="l68"></a>hood had no breasts, &amp; her brother who sucked the breasts <a id="l69"></a>of her mother &amp; to whom she wishes Solomon were <a id="l70"></a>like that she might kiss him whenever she finds him <a id="l71"></a>&amp; lead him &amp; bring him to her mother's house. And <a id="l72"></a>of about the same age  with these children was Se<a id="l73"></a>sak, so that he may be recconed among the sons of this King.</p>
<p id="par14">Diodorus<sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> that the father of Sesostris <a id="l74"></a>gathered together out of Egypt the male children who <a id="l75"></a>were born the same day with Sesostris &amp; placed them with <a id="l76"></a>nurses &amp; governours &amp; prescribed to them all the same form <a id="l77"></a>of education &amp; discipline being perswaded that they who <a id="l78"></a>were so brought up with his son would be most faith<a id="l79"></a>full &amp; usefull to him in his wars. These children he <a id="l80"></a>brought up with exercises of dayly labours commanding <a id="l81"></a> that none of them should eat till he had run 180 <a id="l82"></a> furlongs. By which he means they became endued <a id="l83"></a>with strong &amp; active bodies &amp; great aspiring minds. Hence <a id="l84"></a>I gather that Ammon the father of Sesostris began his reign in <a id="l85"></a>Egypt before Sesostris (or Sesak) was born &amp; by consequence <a id="l86"></a>in the reign of David as above, &amp; therefore he was that <a id="l87"></a>Pharaoh king of Egypt who married his wives sister to <a id="l88"></a>Hadad &amp; his daughter to Solomon &amp; took Gezar from <a id="l89"></a>the Canaanites &amp; gave it to his daughter for a  <a id="l90"></a>present, &amp; who began his reign a little before Hadad fled from David <a id="l91"></a>So then  Ammon reigned in Egypt when Cadmus <a id="l92"></a>came into Europe as we noted above. And considering <a id="l93"></a>the age of his Children, he seems to have been about <a id="l94"></a> 3<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>9<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> or 40 years old  at the death of David.</p>
<p id="par15">After  the shepherds were <a id="l95"></a>expelled by Amosis &amp; the kingdom of Egypt was established <a id="l96"></a>at home, Ammon sent an army<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> under the command of his <a id="l97"></a>Son Sesostris into Arabia (perhaps that Arabia which lyes between <a id="l98"></a>Egypt &amp; the red sea) &amp; Sesostris accompanied with those <a id="l99"></a>who were brought up with him destroyed the serpents <a id="l100"></a>&amp; overcoming the want of water &amp; food conquered all <a id="l101"></a>that barbarous nation which till then had been uncon<a id="l102"></a>quered.

<p id="par18">After  Amosis had expelled the shepherds &amp; esta<a id="l131"></a>blished his kingdom at home,  Amon sent an army<sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> under <a id="l132"></a>the command of his son Sesostris into Arabia, (that Arabia <a id="l133"></a>which lyes between Egypt &amp; the Red Sea) &amp; Sesostris accom<a id="l134"></a>panied with those who were brought up with him destroyed <a id="l135"></a>the serpents &amp; overcoming the want of water &amp; food <a id="l136"></a>conquered all that barbarous nation which till then had <a id="l137"></a>been unconquered. Then being sent by his father against <a id="l138"></a>the nations which lay westward, he subdued the greatest part <a id="l139"></a>of Libya although hitherto a very youth. </p>

<p id="par19" class="i0">By the first of these conquests the Troglodytes &amp; some of the Arabic Ethi<a id="l141"></a>opians, by the latter the Libyans of  Marmarica &amp; Cyrene &amp; all Ammonia as <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> far as the river Triton came under the dominion of Egypt. And <a id="l142"></a>this seems to have given occasion to the trafic of Solomon into <a id="l143"></a>Egypt for horses. For Egypt was then supplied with horses from <a id="l144"></a>Cyrene a country famous for  breeding <a id="l145"></a>a multitude of good horses And Dicæarchus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> reports that Sesonchosis was the first who found out the art of riding on horses. Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> tells us that the Ammo<a id="l146"></a>nians being Colonies of the Egyptians &amp; Ethiopians spake a lan<a id="l147"></a>guage between them both &amp; that the inhabitants as far as the <a id="l148"></a>river Triton used the Egyptian manners but beyond that <a id="l149"></a>river lived much otherwise. Ammon therefore upon conquering <a id="l150"></a>this large region peopled it with colonies from Egypt &amp; called <a id="l151"></a>it Ammonia. For in those days it was very usuall to call <a id="l152"></a>peoples &amp; regions by the names of their first kings: &amp; Stepha<a id="l153"></a>nus tells us that mediterranean part of Libya &amp; even <a id="l154"></a>all Libya was called Ammonia from Ammon.</p>
<p id="par20">After the death of Ammon Sesostris succeeded in the throne <a id="l155"></a>&amp; being now grown up &amp; encouraged by his former successes aimed <a id="l156"></a>at conquering the world.

He lets us understand also that <a id="l408"></a>the Egyptians attributed this regulation of their govern<a id="l409"></a>ment to him whom they accounted the author of their <a id="l410"></a>Arts &amp; sacred rites &amp; letters &amp; whom their Priests <a id="l411"></a>honoured by the name of Mercury or Hermes, that <a id="l412"></a>is to Thoth whome some would have to be Moses <a id="l413"></a>or Ioseph, but who was really an Egyptian the son of Osiris &amp; <a id="l414"></a>reigned in Egypt  after the  death of Isis <a id="l415"></a>.</p>

For all Egypt <a id="l453"></a>did not worship all Mercuries Gods but in one Convention <a id="l454"></a>they worshipped one God in another, each with his <a id="l455"></a>proper ceremonies &amp; worship.  Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n50-ref">[50]</sup> tells us that they <a id="l456"></a>worshipped not the same Gods except Osiris &amp; Isis.

In <a id="l465"></a>the feast at Busiris after they had sacrificed they beat <a id="l466"></a>themselves &amp; some cut their foreheads with swords.

<p id="par36">How these Nomes conquered one another or otherwise be<a id="l477"></a>came united into larger kingdoms &amp; what alterations happened <a id="l478"></a>in those kingdoms in the first ages is not related in history.

<p id="par38">Some time after the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt <a id="l489"></a>the Sheepherds from the east  invaded &amp; conquered  <a id="l490"></a>Timaus king of the lower Egypt &amp; burnt the cities &amp; sub<a id="l491"></a>verted the Temples of the Egyptians &amp; reduced the people <a id="l492"></a>into servitude &amp; reigning there a long time had various wars with <a id="l493"></a>the Kings of Thebais. This invasion I place after the de<a id="l494"></a>parture of Israel out of Egypt because during their stay <a id="l495"></a>in Egypt there is no mention of Sheepherds or Arabians there but Pharaoh &amp; all his people are spoken of as Egypti<a id="l496"></a>ans.  The Israelites had been in Egypt for 215 years &amp; yet remained a distinct people so as not to be called Egyptians. And the Shepherds remained a distinct people  the Egyptians drove them out of Egypt &amp; by way of distinction they were <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> called Hiesos that is shepherd kings. But in the story of Moses the king is called Pharaoh, &amp; he and his captains &amp;  army &amp; all his people  except the Israelites are considered <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013r"> &lt;13r&gt; </span>  as one nation &amp; called Egyptians without any distinction. Pharaoh sought the life of Moses for killing an Egyptian (Exod 2.15.) The Iews were in bondage under the Egyptians (Exod. 3.8, 9) The ten plagues fell on the Egyptians &amp; the Egyptians were drowned in the red see. Not one word in all the story of any other people then Egyptians &amp; Israelites. And its further to be observed that the worship of the calf which Israel brought out of Egypt was not that of  the Canaanites or Arabians  but that which the genuine Egyptians paid to their God Osiris. And Pharaoh feared least upon any incursion of  forreigners Israel should help them &amp; go with them out of the land. And that as shepherds were an abomination to the Egyptians in the days of Iacob so the sacrifices of shepherds were an abomination to the Egyptians in the days of Moses. (Exod 10. 9) It was  after this time therefore that Egypt came under the dominion of the shepherds.</p>
<p id="par39">These shepherds after their first seating themselves in <a id="l508"></a>Egypt made Salatis their King &amp; after him reigned Beon, <a id="l509"></a>Aphacnas, Apophis Ianias Assis &amp; others successively..

<p id="par40">Herodotus in giving an account of the ancient state of <a id="l533"></a>Egypt tells us that the Egyptian Priests affirmed Menes to <a id="l534"></a>be their first King, &amp;  that they read to him out of a book  the names <a id="l535"></a>of 330 Kings of Egypt who all reigned before Sesostris, &amp; <a id="l536"></a>amongst whom were 18 Ethiopians &amp; a forreign woman <a id="l537"></a>named Nitocris who acquired the Kingdom by a memorable <a id="l538"></a>revenge of her brothers death; &amp; that the Priests reported <a id="l539"></a>nothing memorable done by any of the rest except one <a id="l540"></a>who was the last of them &amp; was called Mæris.

Herodotus <a id="l545"></a>therefore justly passes over  in a few words all the ages <a id="l546"></a>of Egypt before Sesostris as obscure &amp; conteining nothing <a id="l547"></a>memorable &amp; begins his history of the Kings of Egypt with <a id="l548"></a>this king,  the former kings reigning not over <a id="l549"></a>all Egypt successively but divers of them at once in severall <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> parts of Egypt which renders them the less memorable. <a id="l550"></a>In the time of the Monarchy of Egypt Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n59-ref">[59]</sup> who has given the best account of this Kingdom sets down <a id="l551"></a>their Kings in this order. 1 Sesostris. 2 Pheron. 3 Proteus. 4 Rhampsi<a id="l552"></a>nitus. 5 Cheops. <sup>6</sup> Cephren. <sup>7</sup> Mycerinus. <sup>8</sup> Asychis. <sup>9</sup> Anysis. <sup>10</sup> Sabbacus <a id="l553"></a>the Ethiopian. <sup>11</sup> Anysis again. <sup>12</sup> Sethon Priest of Vulcan. <a id="l554"></a><sup>13</sup> Twelve contemporary Kings. <sup>14</sup> Psammiticus. <sup>15</sup> Necho. <sup>16</sup> Psammis. <sup>17</sup> Apries. <sup>18</sup> Amasis. <a id="l555"></a><sup>19</sup> Psammenites.

<p id="par41">The Kings of Thebes  Sesostris having expelled the Sheep<a id="l557"></a>herds out of Egypt &amp; thereby established their dominion at home <a id="l558"></a>began soon to invade their neighbours.

<p id="par45">Proteus was of Memphys &amp; reigned  in that city &amp; left a <a id="l656"></a>sumptuous Temple  there to the south of the Temple <a id="l657"></a>of Vulcan. In this Temple was the house of Venus Hospita <a id="l658"></a>by which name Herodotus conjectured that Helena the daughter <a id="l659"></a>of Tyndarus was meant having heard that she stayed in Egypt <a id="l660"></a>with Proteus &amp; was called Venus Hospita, &amp; being told so by the <a id="l661"></a>Priests of Egypt. For when Alexander stole her from her <a id="l662"></a>husband Menelaus the Greek, in his flight he was driven with <a id="l663"></a>her upon the coast of Egypt &amp; there suspected by Thonis <a id="l664"></a>governour of the place &amp; sent to Proteus at Memphys &amp; <a id="l665"></a>Proteus examining the matter deteined Helena &amp; sent home <a id="l666"></a>Alexander. Then the Greeks demanding her of the Trojans <a id="l667"></a>made war upon Troy thinking that Alexander had carried her <a id="l668"></a>thither. But after the destruction of Troy Menelaus went for <a id="l669"></a>her into Egypt. And to this history saith Herodotus Homer alludes <a id="l670"></a>in mentioning the errors of Paris with Helena by sea upon the <a id="l671"></a>coast of Sidon before the war &amp; the voyage of Menelaus <a id="l672"></a>into Egypt after it. [Chronologers now make the Trojan war <a id="l673"></a>200 years older then this King, but the chronology of <a id="l674"></a>the Greeks before the  times of the Persian Monarchy is very uncertain. I had rather <a id="l675"></a>trust arguments from synchronisms. Certainly Homer speaks of <a id="l676"></a>Thebes as in its glory &amp; greatness with 100 gates &amp; 20000 chariots <a id="l677"></a>&amp; immense riches in the time of the Trojan war, &amp; this de<a id="l678"></a>scription could not agree to Thebes before the days of Se<a id="l679"></a>sostris. Hesiod makes Memnon one of the successors of Sesostris to be the son of Tythonus &amp; <a id="l680"></a>Aurora: which Tythonus, saith Diodorus, <em class="underline">was the son of Laome<a id="l681"></a>don &amp; brother of Priamus &amp; warring in the eastern parts went <a id="l682"></a>as far as Ethiopia</em> (that is, was carried captive by Sesostris into <a id="l683"></a>Thebais) <em class="underline">whence came the fable of Memnons being born of <a id="l684"></a>Aurora</em>. Pindar calls Memnon the son of Aurora &amp;  cousin german of Troilus,  (Pindar Nem. Ode 1) which Troilus was one of the sons of Priam. Memnon was therefore one generation younger then <a id="l685"></a>Tithonus &amp; Priamus,  &amp; by consequence contemporary to Alexander, Hellena &amp; the <a id="l686"></a>Trojan warr. And  this synchronism  is confirmed by its giving occasion to a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017r"> &lt;17r&gt; </span> story related by Pinder Pausanias Diodorus &amp; other ancients of Memnon's being at the <a id="l687"></a>war of Troy &amp; there slain by Achilles,  the Greeks taking occasion <a id="l689"></a>from the synchronism to frame this story in honour of their <a id="l690"></a>nation. And if Æneas was contemporary to Dido as Virgil makes <a id="l691"></a>him, he  must have lived in the age of Memnon. Pliny<sup class="note" id="n65-ref">[65]</sup> <a id="l692"></a>places the taking of Troy in the reegne of Ramises or Rhampsi<a id="l693"></a>nitus  the predecessor of Memnon &amp; this also may be true if <a id="l694"></a>Ramises sent Memnon abroad with an army. And Proteus might <a id="l695"></a>be contemporary to them both if he was not the King himselfe <a id="l696"></a>but a Prince or Viceroy set over the lower Egypt by the King. <a id="l697"></a>For he is distinguished from the race of the Theban Kings by <a id="l698"></a>his being a Memphite of ignoble extraction reigning there,<sup class="note" id="n66-ref">[66]</sup> &amp; Proteus is a Greek <a id="l699"></a>word of the same signification with Adad in Syriack &amp; Primus <a id="l700"></a>or Princeps in Latine or a Prince in English &amp; therefore seems <a id="l701"></a>to be not the proper name of a man but a title of honour <a id="l702"></a>For had it been a proper name the Greeks would have <a id="l703"></a>retained the Egyptian word without translating it, where <a id="l704"></a>as Herodotus tells us that it is the Kings name in Greek <a id="l705"></a>that is a Greek word of the same signification with his name <a id="l706"></a>or title in the Egyptian language.

And By these instances it <sup><span class="small">✝</span></sup> appears that <a id="l872"></a>the eastern nations of those ages deified such of their kings <a id="l873"></a>as were conquerors &amp; benefactors &amp; founders of royal cities &amp; Temples: &amp; <a id="l874"></a>therefore since Ammon &amp; Sesostris were such kings of Egypt &amp; <a id="l875"></a>Sesostris in the largeness of his conquests &amp; benefactions exceeded <a id="l876"></a>all that kings that ever were: we need not wonder if the Egyptians <a id="l877"></a>worshipped these two above all their kings, or that Sesostris should <a id="l878"></a>be  the great God Osiris whom they chiefly worshipped. <a id="l879"></a>For since they did not worship him by the name of  Sesostris <a id="l880"></a>or Sesak, that being his name as a man, he must be one of the Gods whom they worshipped <a id="l881"></a>by another name &amp; the chief of them.</p>
<p id="par52">Sesostris having derived the river Nile into all the lower <a id="l882"></a>Egypt by  new canals, the Egyptians consecrated that river <a id="l883"></a>to him &amp; worshipped him &amp; the river together &amp; called them <a id="l884"></a>both by the same names. So Homer calls that river Ægyptus, &amp; <a id="l885"></a>Manetho tells us that Sethosis was called Ægyptus. Also the River <a id="l886"></a>was called Sihor, Siris &amp; O-siris; &amp; the king was called Siris <a id="l887"></a>or Sirius &amp; by the Greeks O-siris.

When colonies out of Egypt <a id="l1095"></a>were disperst into all parts of the world, then was the colony of Egypti<a id="l1096"></a>ans placed in Babylonia,  &amp; that was in the days of Bacchus. Babylonia <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024v"> &lt;24v&gt; </span> was therefore conquered first by Belus an Egyptian in founding the <a id="l1097"></a>monarchy of Egypt &amp; then by Belus an Assyrian in founding <a id="l1098"></a>the monarchy of Assyria. Of the first Belus, Strabo makes this mention: Durat adhuc ibi (Babylone) Iovis Beli templum: inventer <a id="l1099"></a>hic fuit sideralis scientiæ. And Stephanus: Babylon viri Babylonis <a id="l1100"></a>opus antiquissimum, sapientissimi filij Beli, non, ut Herodotus, Se<a id="l1101"></a>miramidis. Hac enim erat antiquior duo millia annorum, ut He<a id="l1102"></a>rennius prodidit. Semiramis was contemporary to Ninus the son of <a id="l1103"></a>the Assyrian Belus: the Babylonian Belus was much older, the <a id="l1104"></a>the interval of time being her magnified to 2000 years. By his <a id="l1105"></a>being the inventor of Astronomy he lived in the ages of Ammon <a id="l1106"></a>&amp; his sons, &amp; by his placing a colony of Egyptians at Babylon,  <a id="l1107"></a>freeing them from taxes &amp; forming their government after the <a id="l1108"></a>manner of Egypt, he was king of Egypt &amp; Babylonia was a <a id="l1109"></a>province of his kingdom; all which is the character of Bacchus</p>
<p id="par66">When Bacchus invaded the nations he found them without swords <a id="l1110"></a>&amp; other weapons of iron, which made his conquests easy. In Europe Cadmus first <a id="l1111"></a>found out brass in Bœotia &amp; then the Idæi Dactyli found out iron in Crete in <a id="l1112"></a>the mountain Ida. The Marble makes them contemporary to Minos. Clemens<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n128-ref">[128]</sup> <a id="l1113"></a>tells us that they were  Phrygians &amp; Barbarians <a id="l1114"></a>&amp; the first wise men &amp; found out the Ephesian letters &amp; Rhymes in Music <a id="l1115"></a>whence Musitians called them Dactyli. He<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n129-ref">[129]</sup> places them between the inundation <a id="l1116"></a>of Deucalion &amp; expedition of Perseus. They<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n130-ref">[130]</sup> used to dance in armour shaking <a id="l1117"></a>their heads &amp; striking brass upon brass in harmony. Solinus Polyistor c XI tells us: Studium musicum inde cæptum cum Idæi Dactyli modulos crepitu &amp; lin<a id="l1118"></a>nitu æris deprehensos in versificum ordinem transtulissent. By all which they <a id="l1119"></a>lived about the time that Bacchus brought Music &amp; Poetry into Europe &amp; <a id="l1120"></a>derived their wisdom &amp; skill from Egypt. The Greeks had no iron till they found it out. About the same time Artificers <a id="l1121"></a>began to make armour in Lemnos under the  management of a Master <a id="l1122"></a>whom the   Latines call Vulcan. And Prometheus who was contempo<a id="l1123"></a>rary to Osiris &amp; governed a colony of Egyptians at mount Caucasus <a id="l1124"></a>taught the people there Astronomy &amp; letters &amp; to build houses in the <a id="l1125"></a>rome of caves &amp; dens in which they lived before &amp; to yoke Oxen &amp; draw <a id="l1126"></a>chariots with horses &amp; to sail in ships, &amp; to dig iron &amp; brass &amp; silver &amp; gold <a id="l1127"></a>out of the earth &amp; work them in the fire as Æschylus describes Till then they had no weapons of iron. So <a id="l1128"></a>also the people of Libya were without weapons of iron till the Egyp<a id="l1129"></a>tians invaded them. For Pliny tells us: <em class="underline">Prælium Afri primum fecere contra <a id="l1130"></a>Ægyptios fustibus quos vocant Phalangas</em>. And Higynus: <em class="underline">Afri &amp; Ægyptij <a id="l1131"></a>primum fustibus dimicaverunt, postea Belus Neptuni filius gladio belligeratus <a id="l1132"></a>est a quo bellum dictum</em>. Belus therefore was that conqueror who with <a id="l1133"></a>swords &amp; spears invaded the unarmed nations &amp; by that means carried <a id="l1134"></a>his conquests over the world, &amp; therefore he was the same king with Bacchus <a id="l1135"></a>This is the great Iupiter Belus of the east, for whom Vulcan &amp; his work<a id="l1136"></a>men made thunderbolts, that is weapons of war, &amp; who is figured with a <a id="l1137"></a>thunderbolt in one hand to represent him a king, &amp; rides on an eagle to represent the <a id="l1138"></a>sublimity of his dominion.  <a id="l1140"></a>And to this Iupiter Belus was the famous temple erected at Babylon. </p>

<p id="par82">In three of the Dynasties of Manetho above mentioned <a id="l1492"></a>Sesostris is said to have reigned 48 years.

But in <a id="l1496"></a>the reign of Asa king of Iudah the land was quiet ten <a id="l1497"></a>years untill Zera the Ethiopian came against it. And <a id="l1498"></a>in those ten years Asa sought the Lord &amp; built &amp; forti<a id="l1499"></a>fied the cities of Iudah &amp; prepared an army of five hun<a id="l1500"></a>dred  &amp; eighty thousand men with which in the 15<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l1501"></a>of his reign he met &amp; fought Zera 2 Chron. 14.1, 6, 8, 9 &amp; <a id="l1502"></a>15.5, 6, 10. The lands were therefore vexed untill the <a id="l1503"></a>fift year of Asa &amp; then began to revolt, that is at the <a id="l1504"></a>death of Sesostris. For Herodotus tells us that Sesostris <a id="l1505"></a>was the only king that enjoyed the empire.

By <a id="l1578"></a> her he had several daughters the two chief of which <a id="l1579"></a>were Basilea [i. e. Isis] &amp; Rhea by some called Pandora. <a id="l1580"></a>Basilea being older &amp; more prudent then the rest nurst up <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p035r"> &lt;35r&gt; </span> her brothers &amp; was thence called Magna Mater. After the <a id="l1581"></a>death of Vranus she was made Queen &amp; married her brother <a id="l1582"></a>Hyperion [i. e. Osiris] by whom she had two children Helios <a id="l1583"></a>&amp; Selene [i. e. Apollo &amp; Diana or Orus &amp; Bubaste] But her <a id="l1584"></a>brothers entering into a conspiracy assassinated Hyperion &amp; <a id="l1585"></a>drowned Helio in Eridanus [i. e. the Nile] whereupon Selene <a id="l1586"></a>threw herself down from the house top &amp; Basilea went <a id="l1587"></a>distracted &amp; disappeared. – After the death of Hyperion <a id="l1588"></a>the children of  Vranus divided the kingdom amongst <a id="l1589"></a>themselves. The most renouned of them were Atlas &amp; Sa<a id="l1590"></a>turn &amp; the country bordering upon the ocean fell to the lot of <a id="l1591"></a>Atlas. From him the Atlantides &amp; the mountain Atlas <a id="l1592"></a>had their name. He was an excellent Astronomer &amp; was <a id="l1593"></a>the first that discovered the knowledge of the shhere. <a id="l1594"></a>– His brother Saturn was very prophane &amp; covetous. He <a id="l1595"></a>reigned over Sicily Africa &amp; Italy &amp; enlarged his domi<a id="l1596"></a>nion over the western parts of the world. He married <a id="l1597"></a>his sister Rhea &amp; by her had Iupiter [i. e. Amenophes <a id="l1598"></a>or Memnon] who was just &amp; courteous &amp; succeeded in the <a id="l1599"></a>kingdom either as given up to him by his father or set <a id="l1600"></a>upon the throne by the people out of hatred to his father. <a id="l1601"></a>And tho Saturn afterwards by the Titans made war upon <a id="l1602"></a>him yet Iupiter overcame in battel &amp; so gained the king<a id="l1603"></a>dom, &amp; afterwards ran through the whole world doing <a id="l1604"></a>good to all mankind. And because he was of a strong <a id="l1605"></a>body &amp; vertuous mind he easily conquered the whole  <a id="l1606"></a>world. And they of whom he deserved well, rewarded <a id="l1607"></a>him with this honour that he was unanimously by all <a id="l1608"></a>placed in the highest heavens &amp; called a God &amp; supreme <a id="l1609"></a>Lord of the earth. Thus far the Theology of the <a id="l1610"></a>Atlantides; for understanding which it is to be noted that <a id="l1611"></a>several nations had several Iupiters, &amp; whoever was <a id="l1612"></a>Iupiter his father, grandfather &amp; great-grandfather were <a id="l1613"></a>Saturn Vranus &amp; Hypsuranius respectively. So the Iupiter <a id="l1614"></a>of the Atlantides being Memnon their Saturn &amp; Vranus <a id="l1615"></a>were the father &amp; grand father of Memnon whom the <a id="l1616"></a>Egyptians called  Hercules &amp; Ammon. And this <a id="l1617"></a>confusion of names has much obscured the history of those <a id="l1618"></a>times.</p>
<p id="par87">Orus the son &amp; successor of Osiris is by Diodorus called <a id="l1619"></a>Sesostris the second by Pliny Nuncoreus {a name perhaps compounded <a id="l1620"></a>of Orus) &amp; by Herodotus Phero that is Pharaoh the common name <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p036r"> &lt;36r&gt; </span> of the kings of Egypt. He placed in Heliopolis two Obelisks <a id="l1621"></a>an hundred cubits long &amp; eight broad one of which was carried <a id="l1622"></a>to Rome by Caius. He is said to have fallen blind &amp; recovered <a id="l1623"></a>his sight by such miracles as make that part of his story <a id="l1624"></a>look fabulous. He made no wars abroad &amp; seems to have <a id="l1625"></a>reigned but a short time being drowned in the Nile by the <a id="l1626"></a>Titans &amp; found dead in the water. Whence came the fable of Phaeton.  the <em class="underline">Son of the Sun,</em>  a title which denotes him king of Egypt. In his reign Isis &amp; Mercury <a id="l1627"></a>made laws for Egypt &amp;, as Diodorus tells us, <em class="underline">celebrated <a id="l1628"></a>the funerals of Osiris with sacrifices &amp; divine honours <a id="l1629"></a>as to one of the Gods &amp; instituted many sacred rites &amp; <a id="l1630"></a>mystical ceremonies in </em>memory of the mighty works <a id="l1631"></a>wrought by this Hero now deified.</p>
<p id="par88">At the death of Orus the Ethiopians under Hercules <a id="l1632"></a>seem to have invaded Egypt. For Pliny<sup class="note" id="n206-ref">[206]</sup> tells us, `<em class="underline">Ægyptioruū <a id="l1633"></a>bellis attrita est Ethiopia vicissim imperitando serviendoque <a id="l1634"></a>clara et potens etiam usque ad Trojana bella Memnone <a id="l1635"></a>regnante</em>. Æthiopia served Egypt in the reign of Sesostris, <a id="l1636"></a>&amp; no longer for Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n207-ref">[207]</sup> tells us that <em class="underline">he alone enjoyed the <a id="l1637"></a>Empire of Ethiopia</em>, &amp; within ten years after his death the <a id="l1638"></a>Ethiopians were Lords of Egypt. For in the 15<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l1639"></a>Asa king of Iudah Zerah the Ethiopian with an army <a id="l1640"></a>of a thousand thousand Ethiopians &amp; Libyans invaded <a id="l1641"></a>Iudea. Their way was through Egypt, &amp; therefore they <a id="l1642"></a>were lords of Egypt. Before this invasion Asa had peace <a id="l1643"></a>ten years &amp; in all that time prepared against a storm. For <a id="l1644"></a>while the land was yet before him he sought the Lord &amp; destroyed Idolatry &amp; fortified the cities of Iudah with walls &amp; <a id="l1645"></a>towers &amp; gates &amp; bars &amp; prepared an army of five hundred <a id="l1646"></a>&amp; eighty thousand men. This he did without any cheque <a id="l1647"></a>from the Egyptians having work enough at home. At <a id="l1648"></a>length when Zerak with an army of Ethiopians &amp; Libyans <a id="l1649"></a>advanced from Egypt he met them with his army &amp; routed <a id="l1650"></a>them totally at Maresh a town of Iudea towards Egypt. <a id="l1651"></a>&amp; pursued them to Gerar &amp; smote the cities about Gerar, <a id="l1652"></a>&amp; as he returned with much spoile Azariah the Prophet <a id="l1653"></a>went out to meet him &amp; said: <em class="underline">Hear ye me Asa &amp; Iudah <a id="l1654"></a>&amp; Benjamin; The Lord is with you while ye be with <a id="l1655"></a>him, but if you forsake him he will forsake you. Now <a id="l1656"></a>for a long  season Israel hath been without a true God <a id="l1657"></a>&amp; without a teaching Priest &amp; without law. And in those <a id="l1658"></a>times</em> [videlicet under the dominion of Egypt untill the death <a id="l1659"></a>of Sesostris] <em class="underline">there was no peace to him that went out nor <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p037r"> &lt;37r&gt; </span> to him that came in but great vexations were upon <a id="l1660"></a>all the inhabitants of those countries, &amp; nation was de<a id="l1661"></a>stroyed of nation &amp; city of city: for God did vex them <a id="l1662"></a>with all adversity. But when Israel in their trouble <a id="l1663"></a>did turn unto the Lord &amp; sought him he was found of <a id="l1664"></a>them</em>.</p>
<p id="par89">By this victory the Iews shook off the dominion of <a id="l1665"></a>Egypt. For whereas Sesak had taken away all the trea<a id="l1666"></a>sures of the Temple, Asa<sup class="note" id="n208-ref">[208]</sup> now brought into the Temple <a id="l1667"></a>the silver &amp; gold &amp; vessels which he &amp; his father had <a id="l1668"></a>dedicated in the room of what Sesak had taken away. <a id="l1669"></a> &amp; renewed the Altar &amp; assembling all the people in <a id="l1672"></a>the third month to a sacrifice of the spoiles, they entered into <a id="l1673"></a>a covenant upon oath to seek the Lord, &amp; that whoever would <a id="l1674"></a>not seek the Lord should be put to death. And henceforward <a id="l1675"></a>Asa&amp; his son Iehosaphat flourished in power &amp; wealth for <a id="l1676"></a>many years &amp; Egypt continued in troubles. And as the Machabees <a id="l1677"></a>after the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, &amp; Ezra after the <a id="l1678"></a>Babylonian captivity collected the sacred writings for the use of <a id="l1679"></a>the people, so the Prophets in the days of Asa seem to have done the like. <a id="l1680"></a>For Iehosaphat<sup class="note" id="n209-ref">[209]</sup> in the third year of his reign sent Princes &amp; <a id="l1681"></a>Priests &amp; Levites to teach in the cities of Iudah &amp; they had the <a id="l1682"></a>book of the Law with them &amp; went throughout the cities of Iudah <a id="l1683"></a>&amp; taught the people. By the book of the Law I understand <a id="l1684"></a>all the Pentateauch in the form that we now have it, the copy <a id="l1685"></a>thereof found in the Temple in Iosiah's reign being ever <a id="l1686"></a>since followed.</p>
<p id="par90">And now the power of Egypt being broken the Argonauts were sent to the nations upon the Euxin &amp; Mediterranean seas to sollicit them to revolt &amp; Prometheus with his people after 30 years stay at mount Caucasus was  released &amp; the Philistims <a id="l1687"></a>whom Sesostris had carried into captivity &amp; placed in Caphtor <a id="l1688"></a>or Cappadocia were set at liberty to return home &amp; did so according to the <a id="l1689"></a>Prophet: <em class="underline">Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of <a id="l1690"></a>Egypt &amp; the Philistims from Caphtor</em>. Amos. 9.7.</p>
<p id="par91">Pausanias<sup class="note" id="n210-ref">[210]</sup> tells us that the Libyans under the command of Sardus <a id="l1691"></a>the son of Maceris whom the Egyptians &amp; Libyans called Hercules were the first who had passed in ships into Sardinia <a id="l1692"></a> and <a id="l1693"></a> carried into Sardinia a colony of Libyans who did not drive out the <a id="l1694"></a>old inhabitants but mixed with them. The Egyptian Hercules there<a id="l1695"></a>fore  after the war between the Egyptians &amp; Libyans was composed by <a id="l1696"></a>Mercury, invaded &amp; subdued Libya (as the Poets represent by his invading the Gardens of the Hesperides)  he  &amp; from thence his son  afterwards  retired to Sardinia. Mythologists tell us that <a id="l1698"></a>Hercules first  slew Antæus in Libya &amp; then went into <a id="l1699"></a>Egypt &amp; slew Busiris,   that is, the Ethiopians under Maceris surnamed Hercules subdued first Libya &amp; then the lower Egypt, slaying their kings Antæus &amp; Busiris. And after these conquests they seem to have invaded Iudea under Zerah <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p038r"> &lt;38r&gt; </span>  <a id="l1701"></a> there were Libyans in their army &amp; their way was through Egypt. Whether Maceris or Sesostris was the Hercules who conquered to the western bounds of Afric &amp; there set up pillars is  not recorded in History. But it looks more like the conquest of Sesostris. After he came to the river Triton there was nothing to stop him. Lucan tells us that he conquered to the utmost bounds of the west &amp; it was his custome to set up pillars in all his conquests. And some tell us that Hercules set up an Altar or Pillar in India, which I understand of the same Hercules.</p>
<p id="par92">Hesiod describes four ages of the Gods, the first a <a id="l1706"></a>golden age under the reign of Saturn which began with the birth <a id="l1707"></a>of the Gods &amp; was void of labour &amp; trouble &amp; in which men <a id="l1708"></a>lived of the spontaneous fruits of the earth. When these men <a id="l1709"></a>died they were made Gods, &amp; there arose a second age of silver <a id="l1710"></a>much worse then the first, in which a boy was nursed an hun<a id="l1711"></a>dred years by his mother untill he grew up. After they were <a id="l1712"></a>grown up they lived a while in trouble but being injurious <a id="l1713"></a>to one another &amp; not worshipping the Gods nor sacrificing <a id="l1714"></a>as they ought to do they were laid in the ground with <a id="l1715"></a>due honour &amp; Iupiter raised a third age of brass vehement <a id="l1716"></a>&amp; strong &amp; warlike &amp; fierce who had weapons &amp; houses <a id="l1717"></a>of brass by reason that iron was not yet found out. And <a id="l1718"></a>these overcoming themselves died &amp; were buried &amp; Iupiter <a id="l1719"></a>raised a forth age of Heros who were called semi-gods, &amp; <a id="l1720"></a>these also were destroyed by evil war &amp; battels some at <a id="l1721"></a>Thebes fighting for the wealth of Oedipus &amp; others at Troy <a id="l1722"></a>contending about Helena. And now saith Hesiod I wish that <a id="l1723"></a>I did not live in the fift age, for now is the iron age labo<a id="l1724"></a>rious &amp; miserable &amp; full of cares, but Iupiter shall destroy <a id="l1725"></a>this age of men of various languages after that their heads <a id="l1726"></a>shall grow grey &amp; hoary. Thus far Hesiod. By the ages its plain <a id="l1727"></a>that he means ages of man's life &amp; therefore he himself lived &amp; wrote <a id="l1728"></a>within  less then a mans age  after the war at <a id="l1729"></a>Troy. For the fift age in which he lived he terminates with the <a id="l1730"></a>old age &amp; death of the men then living &amp; begins it at the destruction of Troy, representing that the men of that age, that is the men born  next after the destruction of Troy, were not grown grey when he wrote his poem. He makes the second <a id="l1731"></a>age last above 100 years but it is because he makes men live <a id="l1732"></a>much longer in that age then in his own. There were four <a id="l1733"></a>ages of the Gods of Egypt reigning at Thebes; the first was of Sa<a id="l1734"></a>turn who expelled the Shepherds &amp; whom Mercury painted with <a id="l1735"></a>two faces  with respect to the times before &amp; after the <a id="l1736"></a>erection of the monarchy; the second was of Iupiter Ammon, the third of Osiris &amp; the fourth of Orus &amp; the surviving Gods. The <a id="l1737"></a>first was peaceable, the second unquiet, the third very warlike <a id="l1738"></a>&amp; the fourth warlike troublesome &amp; miserable. Hesiod applying <a id="l1739"></a>this Parable to the Gods of the Greeks &amp; living in the next age after <a id="l1740"></a>the four, counts his own age for a fift &amp; calls that the iron age as <a id="l1741"></a>being the last &amp; the worst.  And as he ends the fourth age  with the wars of <a id="l1742"></a>Thebes &amp; Troy,  so he seems to end the third age with the invention of iron by the Idæi Dactyli in Crete saying that in the third age iron was not yet found out. And since Niobe the daughter of Phoroneus was the first <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p038v"> &lt;38v&gt; </span>

And going on with an <a id="l1751"></a>army [also] by land he subdued all Asia: for he invaded not only the provin<a id="l1752"></a>ces which Alexander the great afterwards  acquired, but also some nations whose <a id="l1753"></a>country he attempted not: for he passed over the river Ganges &amp; went over <a id="l1754"></a>all India to the  [eastern] <em class="underline">ocean</em> In this expedition he passed over <a id="l1755"></a>the straits of the red sea at Dira a promontory of Ethiopia &amp; conquerd Arabia <a id="l1756"></a>Felix &amp; then went on to Persia &amp; India his fleet attending him.
