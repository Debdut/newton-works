<p id="par1">Qu. 23. By what means do  bodies act on one another at a distance. <a id="l1"></a>The ancient Philosophers who held Atoms &amp; Vacuum attributed gravity to Atoms <a id="l2"></a>without telling us the means unless perhaps in figures: as by calling God Har<a id="l3"></a>mony &amp;  representing him &amp; matter by the God Pan &amp; his Pipe, or by calling the <a id="l4"></a>Sun the prison of Jupiter because he keeps the Planets in their orbs. Whence it <a id="l5"></a>seems to have been an ancient opinion that matter depends upon a Deity <a id="l6"></a>for its laws of motion as well as for its existence. The Cartesians make God the <a id="l7"></a>author of all motion &amp; its as reasonable to make him the author of  <a id="l8"></a>the laws of motion. Matter is a passive principle &amp; cannot move it self. <a id="l9"></a>It continues in its state of moving or resting unless disturbed. It receives motion <a id="l10"></a>proportional to the force impressing it. And resists as much as it is resisted. <a id="l11"></a>These are passive laws &amp; to affirm that there are no other is to speak against <a id="l12"></a>experience. For we find in our selves a power of moving our bodies by our <a id="l13"></a>thought Life &amp;  will are active Principles by which we move our bodies, &amp; thence arise other laws of motion unknown to us.</p>
<p id="par2">And since all matter duly formed is attended with signes of life &amp; all   <a id="l14"></a>things are framed with perfect  art &amp; wisdom &amp; Nature does nothing in vain; if there <a id="l15"></a>be an universal life &amp; all space be the sensorium of a thinking being  who by immediate presence perceives all things in it as that which thinks in us <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">perceives</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">see</span></span> their pictures in the brain: the laws of <a id="l19"></a>motion arising from life or will may be of universal extent.</p>
<p id="par3">— those laws. To some such laws the ancient Philosophers seem to have <a id="l20"></a>elluded when they  called God H<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>arm<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ony, &amp;    signified his actuating <a id="l21"></a> matter  harmonicaly  by the God Pan's playing upon a Pipe <a id="l22"></a>&amp;   attribute musick to the spheres made the distances &amp; motions of the heavenly bodies to be harmonical, &amp;  represented the Planets by the seven strings of Apollo's <a id="l24"></a>Harp. </p>
<p id="par4">——— If you think that the Vis inertia is sufficient for conserving motion, pray tell me the Experi<a id="l25"></a>ments from whence you gather this conclusion.  Do you learn by any experiment <a id="l26"></a>that the beating of the heart give no new motion to the blood, that the explosion of Gun<a id="l27"></a>pouder gives no new motion to <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>a<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> bullet or that a man by his will can give no new <a id="l28"></a>motion to his body? Or  do you learn by experiment that the beating of the <a id="l29"></a>heart takes away as much motion from something else as it gives to the blood or that explosi<a id="l30"></a>on takes away as much motion rom something else as it gives to  a bullet or that a man <a id="l31"></a>by his will takes away as much motion from something else as he gives to his body?

A man may  may bring plausible arguments against   the power of the will but I'le beleive experience. A man <a id="l36"></a>may argue plausibly  for blind fate against final causes but I find by experience that <a id="l37"></a> I am constantly aiming  at something. Were it not for experience I should not know <a id="l38"></a>that  matter is heavy or impenetrable or moveable  or that  I think or <a id="l39"></a>am or that there is matter or any thing else.  And therefore to affirm any thing more then I <a id="l40"></a>know by  experience &amp; good reasoning upon it is precarious.  Even arguments for a Being if not taken from Phænomena are slippery &amp; serve only for ostentation. An Atheist will allow <a id="l41"></a>that there is a Being absolutely perfect, necessarily existing &amp; the author of  mankind <a id="l42"></a>&amp; call it Nature: &amp; if you talk of infinite wisdom or of any perfection more then he allows to <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>say<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> in <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>natur<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> heel reccon at a chemæra &amp; tell you that you have the notion of <a id="l43"></a><em class="underline">finite</em> or <em class="underline">limited wisdom</em> from what you find in your self &amp; are able  of your self to  <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>prefin<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the word <a id="l44"></a><em class="underline">no<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>t<span class="nb-n">}</span></span></em>  or <em class="underline">more then</em> to any <em class="underline">verb</em> or <em class="underline">adjective</em> &amp; without the existence of <em class="underline">wisdome not limited</em> or <em class="underline">wisdome more then finite</em> to understand the meaning of the  phrase as easily as Mathematicians understand  what is meant by an infinite <a id="l46"></a>line or an infinite area.

<p id="par5">And While these powers are of so large extent, I do not see but that they may be num<a id="l47"></a>bred among the general laws of motion. The Vis inertiæ is a passive principle by which bodies persist <a id="l48"></a>in their  motion or rest, receive motion in proportion to the force impressing it &amp; resist  as much as they are resisted: By this principle alone there could never have been any motion in the world. Thinking is an active principle by which we move <a id="l50"></a>our bodies according to our will, &amp; thence arise other laws of motion unknown to us, which  if  <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>all<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the Universe be the sensorium of a thinking Being, may be of greater entent. <a id="l52"></a>Gravity was recconed among the laws of motion  by the ancient Philosphers who attributed <a id="l53"></a>gravity to their Atoms in vacuo, &amp;  the forces  above mentioned by which smal <a id="l54"></a>bodies act on one another  at small distances may have a good a title as gravity to be recconed among those laws.</p>
<p id="par6">But while I call those forces attraction &amp; repulse I would not be understood to define the <a id="l55"></a>cause or manner of the action. That which I call attraction may be done by impulse or by some other <a id="l56"></a>meane unknown to me. I only use that word to signify a force by which bodies tend towards <a id="l57"></a>one another whatever perfect  Art &amp; be the cause duly formed is attended with signes of life: <span class="hspac-n" title="23 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <a id="l58"></a>&amp; if since all things are framed with wisdome &amp; Nature does nothing in vain all matter if there be an universal life &amp; all space be the sensorium of <a id="l59"></a>a thinking Being &amp;  finite things  <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 2 words)">{illeg}</span>  be  instead of their sensible pictures formed by motion in our Brain;  those laws <a id="l60"></a>may be of Universal extent.</p>
<p id="par7">I have hitherto been arguing from the effects to their causes &amp;  carried <a id="l61"></a>the argument  up to  certain forces by which little bodies act on one another at small <a id="l62"></a>distances. These forces may be recconed among the laws of motion,   but whether they depend on  Bodies alone considered only a long broad &amp; thick bodies alone may be a question For are passive.  By their vis inertiæ they continue in their state of moving or <a id="l64"></a>resting &amp; receive motion proportional to the force impressing it &amp;  resiste as much as <a id="l65"></a>they  are resisted, but they cannot move themselves; &amp; without some other principle <a id="l66"></a>then the vis inertiæ there could be no motion in the world.  And if there be another Principle of motion there must be other laws of motion <a id="l69"></a> depending on that Principle. And the first thing to be done in Philosophy is to find out all <a id="l70"></a>the general laws of motion  on which the frame of nature depends. <a id="l71"></a> We find in our selves <a id="l73"></a>a power of moving our bodies by our thoughts ] &amp; see the same power in other living creatures but  how this is done &amp; by what laws we do not know.   We cannot say that all Nature is not alive.   not know her laws or powers any <a id="l82"></a>further then we gather them from Phænomena. </p>
<p id="par8">If the  body is compact &amp;  bends or yealds inward to  pression  without  any sliding of its parts,  it is <a id="l83"></a>hard &amp;  elastic returning to its figure with a force arising from the mutual attraction of its parts. If the parts slide <a id="l84"></a> upon one another the body is maleable and soft. If they slip easily &amp; are of a  size most apt to be agitated by heat <a id="l85"></a> &amp; the heat is big enough to keep its parts in agitation the body is fluid, &amp; if <a id="l86"></a>it  be apt to stick to things it is humid; &amp;  the drops of every fluid  affect a round figure <a id="l87"></a>by the mutual attraction of its parts as the globe of the earth &amp; sea affects a round figure <a id="l88"></a>by the mutual attraction of its parts  by gravity.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p621r"> &lt;621r&gt; </span>
<p id="par9">But how two Æthers can be diffused through all space one of which acts upon the <a id="l89"></a>other &amp; by consequence is reacted upon, without retarding slackening shattering &amp; confounding <a id="l90"></a>one anothers motions,  is inconceivable. And against filling <a id="l91"></a>the heavens with fluid Medium unless they be exceeding rare a great objection arises <a id="l92"></a>from the regular &amp; very lasting motions of the Planets &amp; Comets through the heavens in all — — —</p>
<p id="par10">By a vacuum I do not mean a space void of all substances. Glass <a id="l93"></a>cannot attract light without a Medium. I mean only such a Vacuum <a id="l94"></a>as may be made by drawing Aer out of a vessel of glass.</p>
<p id="par11">What I mean  in this Question by a Vacuum, &amp; the attractions of the  rays of light  <a id="l95"></a> towards the glass or crystall, may be understood by  what was said in the <a id="l96"></a>18<sup>th</sup> Question.</p>
<p id="par12">Now in bodies — — — — — forces more easily. And for the like reason Gravity in <a id="l97"></a>the surfaces of small globes is greater in proportion to the globes then in <a id="l98"></a>the surfaces of great globes of equal density. And therefore since the rays <a id="l99"></a>of light are the smallest bodies yet known to us (For I do not here consider <a id="l100"></a>the particles of æther) we may expect to find their attractions very <a id="l101"></a>strong. And how strong they are may be gatherred by this Rule — — — — <a id="l102"></a>— — —; — to be above an hundred million of millions of millions of times <a id="l103"></a>greater in proportion to the matter in them then the gravity of the Earth towards the Sunn in proportion <a id="l104"></a>to the matter in it.</p>
<p id="par13">As attraction is stronger in small magnets then in great ones in proportion <a id="l105"></a>to their bulk, &amp; gravity is greater in the surfaces of small Planets then  in those of great <a id="l106"></a>ones in proportion to their bulk so the smallness of the rays of light may very much <a id="l107"></a>contribute to the force by which they are refracted. And so if any one should suppose <a id="l108"></a>that Ether  (like our aer) may <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>containe<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> particles which  endeavour to recede from one another  (for I <a id="l109"></a>do not know what the Ether is) &amp; that its particles are exceedingly smaller then those of aer, or even the<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>ir<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> those of light, the the exceeding smalness of its  particles  may <a id="l110"></a>contribute to the greatness of the force by which those particles  recede from one another &amp; <a id="l111"></a>thereby  make that medium exceedingly more rare &amp; elastick then Aer.</p>
<p id="par14">And that the gravity of the Planets towards the Sun may not be thought too <a id="l112"></a>great  to be produced by the cause of gravity here  suggested: upon a fair computation it will <a id="l113"></a>found that the gravity of our earth towards the Sun in proportion to the <a id="l114"></a>quantity of its matter is above ten hundred millions of millions of millions <a id="l115"></a>of millions of times less then  the force by which a ray of light in entring <a id="l116"></a>into glass or crystall is drawn or f<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>orced<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> impelled towards the refracting body. And therefore <a id="l117"></a>the gravity of the earth towards the Sun  requires a variation of <a id="l118"></a>the density of the Ether at the Orb of the Earth an hundred millions of <a id="l119"></a>millions of millions of millions of times slower then the variation of the density <a id="l120"></a>of the Ether at the surface of glass or crystal requisite to refract light.

<p id="par23">If two plane polished plates of glass three or four inches broad &amp; about twenty long <a id="l164"></a>be laid  one of them parallel to the horizon the other upon the first so as to <a id="l165"></a>touch it &amp; make an angle with it.   of about 10 or 15 minutes at one of their ends &amp; the same be first <a id="l166"></a>moistened on their inward sides with a cleane cloth dipt into oyle of Oranges, &amp; rubbed upon it &amp; a drop or two of the oyle <a id="l167"></a>be let fall upon he lower glass at the other end: so soon as the upper glass <a id="l168"></a>is laid down upon the lower so as to touch it at one end &amp; to touch the drop at <a id="l169"></a>the other end  making with the lower glass an angle of about 10 or 15 <a id="l170"></a>as above; the drop will begin to move towards the concourse of the glasses  &amp; <a id="l171"></a>will continue to move with an accelerated motion till it arrives at that con<a id="l172"></a>course of the glasses.  [And if  you then open the glasses <a id="l173"></a>where they met &amp; touched &amp; make them  meet &amp; touch at their other end in the <a id="l174"></a>same acute angle as before; the  drop will run back  to that end of the <a id="l175"></a>glasses where they now touch, &amp; where it was at first.]  For the two <a id="l176"></a>glasses attract the drop, &amp;  by the attraction make it run that way <a id="l177"></a>towards which the attractions  incline. And if when the drop is in motion <a id="l178"></a>you lift up that end of the glasses where they meet &amp; towards which <a id="l179"></a>the drop  moves: the drop will ascend between the glasses, &amp; <a id="l180"></a>therefore is attracted. And  as you lift up the glasses, more &amp; more the drop will ascend <a id="l181"></a>slower &amp; slower &amp; at length rest.  And when you see it rest you may reccon that it then <a id="l182"></a>carried downward by its weight as much as upwards by the attraction. And <a id="l183"></a>thereby you may know the force by which the drop is attracted at all distances <a id="l184"></a>from the  contact of the glasses. And  by some experi<a id="l185"></a>ments, the attraction is almost reciprocally as  in a duplicate proportion of the distance <a id="l186"></a>of the  <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>middle<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of the drop from the concours of the glasses.    viz reciprocally in a <a id="l193"></a>simple proportion  by reason of the spreading of <a id="l194"></a>the drop &amp; its touching the glasses in alarger surface; &amp; again reciprocally <a id="l195"></a>in a  simple proportion by reason of the attractions growing stronger within <a id="l196"></a>the same quantity of  attracting surface. The attraction therefore <a id="l197"></a>within the same quantity of surface is reciprocally as the distance between <a id="l198"></a>the glasses. And therefore where the distance is very small, suppose the <a id="l199"></a>ten-thousand-thousandth part of an inch, the attraction must be exceeding <a id="l200"></a>great; so  great perhaps as within in a circle of an inch in diameter to  suffice to hold up a <a id="l201"></a> weight equal to a cylinder of water <a id="l202"></a>of an inch in diameter, &amp;  above a mile in length. There are therefore   Agents in Nature able to to make the particles of bodies attract <a id="l204"></a>one another very strongly &amp; to stick together strongly those by  attractions. One of those <a id="l205"></a> Agents may be the Æther above mentioned whereby light is refracted. Another <a id="l206"></a>may be the Agent or Spirit which causes electrical attraction. For tho this Agent <a id="l207"></a>acts not at great distances  except when it is excited by the friction of electrick bodies: <a id="l208"></a>yet it may act perpetually at very small distances  without friction, &amp; that not only in   bodies accounted electric, but also in some others. And  there <a id="l210"></a>are still other mediums which may cause attractions, (such as are the Magnetick effluvia; <a id="l211"></a> it is the business of experimental Philosophy to  find out all these Medi<a id="l212"></a>ums with their properties.</p>

<p id="par25">By the Table in the second part of the second Book  wherein the thicknesses <a id="l213"></a>of  coloured plates of water  between two <a id="l214"></a>glasses are set down, the thickness of the plate where it  appears very black is <a id="l215"></a>three eighths of the thousand-thousandth part of an inch. And where the Oyle <a id="l216"></a>of Oranges between the glasses is of this thickness, the attraction seems <a id="l217"></a>to be so strong as within a circle of an inch in diameter to suffice to hold <a id="l218"></a>up a weight equal to that of a cylinder of water of an inch in diameter &amp; two or three furlongs in lenghth <a id="l219"></a>And where it is of a less thickness the attraction   may be proportionally greater. <a id="l220"></a>&amp; increase untill the thickness be no bigger then that of a single particle of water.</p>

<p id="par27">The parts — — — — any sensible effect. All bodies — — — — difficult to conceive <a id="l223"></a>The same thing — — — — cohesion of its parts. It is not therefore by the  pressure <a id="l224"></a>of the Æther upon the outside of the Marbles or Mercury (tho such a pressure may <a id="l225"></a>contribute to the effect) but by the action of either that or some other Medium or <a id="l226"></a>Mediums upon the inward parts of those bodies by which the contiguous parts of the <a id="l227"></a>Marbles  &amp; those of the glass &amp; Mercury stick to one another. <a id="l228"></a>The like Experiment hath been tried with water — — — — amongst themselves.</p>
<p id="par28">And of the same kind with these Experiments  are those <a id="l229"></a>that follow. If two plane polished plates of glass (suppose two pieces of a broken <a id="l230"></a>looking-glass) bee laid together so that their  sides be  parallel <a id="l231"></a>&amp; at a very small distance from one another; &amp; then their lower edges be <a id="l232"></a>dipped into water; the water will rise up between them. And the less the <a id="l233"></a>distance of the glasses is  the greater will be the height to which the water <a id="l234"></a>will rise.  If the distance be about the   hundreth part of an inch, the <a id="l235"></a>water will rise to the light of about an inch &amp; if the distance be greater or <a id="l236"></a>less in any proportion, the height will be  reciprocally <a id="l237"></a>proportional to the distance very nearly.  For the attractive force of the glasses is the same whether the distance between them be greater or  less &amp; the weight of the water  drawn up is the same if the height of it be reciprocally proportional to the distance between the glasses. [And in like manner water ascends between two Marbles polished plane, when their polished sides are parallel , &amp; at a very little distance from one another.] And if slender pipes of glass be <a id="l240"></a>dipt at one end into stagnating water the water will rise  up within the <a id="l241"></a>pipe &amp; the hight to which it rises will be reciprocally proportional to the <a id="l242"></a>diameter of the  cavity of the pipe &amp; will equall the height <a id="l243"></a>to which it rises between two   planes of glass if the semidiameter of the cavity <a id="l244"></a>of the Pipe be equal to the distance  between the planes,  or thereabouts. And <a id="l245"></a>these experiments suceed after the same manner in vacuo as in the open <a id="l246"></a>air, &amp; therefore are not influenced by the weight or pressure of the <a id="l247"></a>Atmosphere.</p>
<p id="par29">And if a wide pipe of glass be filled with sifted ashes well pressed together in the glass &amp; <a id="l248"></a>one end of the pipe be dipped into stagnating water; the water will rise up slowly in <a id="l249"></a>the glass so as in the space of a week or afortnight to reach  up to 30 or 40 <a id="l250"></a>inches above the surface of the stagnating water. And  the <a id="l251"></a>water is raised to this height by the attraction of those particles of the ashes only which are upon <a id="l252"></a>the surface of the elevated water;  the particles  which are  within the water, attrac<a id="l253"></a>ting it as much downwards as upwards. And therefore the attraction is very strong <a id="l254"></a> but it would be much stronger  if the ashes  upon the surface of the <a id="l255"></a>attracted water were one continued body, as the glass is which keeps quicksilver sus<a id="l256"></a>pended  to the hight of above 60 or 70 inches,  &amp; therefore attracts <a id="l257"></a>with a force which would keep water suspended to the height of above fifty feet. And the particles of glass, which lie closer to one another then they  do or the quicksilver <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>mor<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> attracts one another with a force much stronger.</p>
