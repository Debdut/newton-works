<p id="par1">The Roman Empire was divided into Provinces, and in <a id="l3"></a>the reign of Constantine the great, the larger Provinces of <a id="l4"></a>the Empire (composed of several small Provinces) began to <a id="l5"></a>be called Diocesses, &amp; the whole Roman Empire was distinguish<a id="l6"></a>ed into 13 or 14 such Diocesses under four Prefects; the Præfectus <a id="l7"></a>Prætorio Orientis, the Præfectus Prætorio Illyrici, the Præfectus <a id="l8"></a>Prætorio Italiæ, &amp; the Præfectus Prætorio Galliarum. Vnder the <a id="l9"></a>Præfectus Prætorio of the East were five Diocesses; the Diocess <a id="l10"></a>of the East governed by the Comes Diœceseos Orientis, the <a id="l11"></a> Diocess of Egypt governed by the Præfectus Diœceseos Ægypti; <a id="l12"></a>the Diocess of Asia governed by a Vicar, the Diocess of <a id="l13"></a>Pontus governed by a Vicar, &amp; the Diocess of Thrace governed <a id="l14"></a>by a Vicar. The Præfectus Prætorio of Illyricum had under <a id="l15"></a>him two Diocesses each governed by a Vicar, the Diocess of Mace<a id="l16"></a>don &amp; the Diocess of Dacia. The  Præfectus Prætorio of Italy <a id="l17"></a>had under him the four Diocesses of Rome, Italy, Afric, &amp; <a id="l18"></a>Illyricum governed by four Vicars. And the Præfectus Præ<a id="l19"></a>torio of Gaul had under him the three Diocesses of Spain <a id="l20"></a>Gaule &amp; Britain governed by three Vicars.</p>
<p id="par2">The Diocess of Egypt comprehended Egypt, Thebais, <a id="l21"></a>Libya, Arcadia, &amp; Augustanica, where the Prefect of the <a id="l22"></a>Diocess resided. The Diocess of the East comprehended Pa<a id="l23"></a>lestine, Phenicia, Syria, Cilicia, Cyprus, Osrhoena, Meso<a id="l24"></a>potamia, Isauria, &amp; Arabia, under the Metropolis of Antioch. <a id="l25"></a>The Diocess of Asia comprehended Asia proconsularis, <a id="l26"></a>Hellespont, Pamphilia, Lydia, Pisidia, Lycaonia, Phrygia <a id="l27"></a>Pacatiana, Phrygia Salutaris, Lycia &amp; Caria, &amp; the Islands <a id="l28"></a>adjacent, under the Metropolis of Ephesus. The Diocess of <a id="l29"></a>Pontus conteined Galatia, Bithynia, Honorias, Cappadocia <a id="l30"></a>prima &amp; secunda, Pontus, Armenia prima &amp; secunda, &amp; Paphla<a id="l31"></a>gonia, under the Metropolis of Cæsaria. The Diocess of <a id="l32"></a>Thrace conteined Europa, Thrace, Hæmi-mons, Rhodopes, <a id="l33"></a>Mœsia secunda, &amp; Scythia lying between Hæmi-mons &amp; the <a id="l34"></a>mouths of the Danube;  &amp; these were under the metropolis of Heraclia <a id="l35"></a>before Constantinople rose up. The Diocess of Macedon <a id="l36"></a>conteined Achaia, Macedon, Crete, Thessaly, &amp; both Epires, <a id="l37"></a>whereof Achaia was under a Proconsul; &amp; these were <a id="l38"></a>under the Metropolis of Thessalonica. And the Diocess of <a id="l39"></a>Dacia conteined Dacia beyond the Danube conquered by Trajan, <a id="l40"></a>Dacia ripensis, Dacia mediterranea, Mœsia prima, Dardania <a id="l41"></a>&amp; Prævalis. But Dacia beyond the Danube was lost from the <a id="l42"></a>Empire in the reign of Gallienus.</p>
<p id="par3">In the first ages of the Christian religion, the Christians of <a id="l43"></a>every city with its villages were governed by a Board or Council <a id="l44"></a>of Elders or Presbyters with a President. And where the people <a id="l45"></a>met to worship there the President &amp; Presbyters met in Council <a id="l46"></a>after the manner of the Iewish Synagogues. And the place <a id="l47"></a>where they met (now called a Cathedral Church) was by the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> Christians of the circumcision called a Synagogue. These Elders <a id="l48"></a>are by the Apostle called Bishops. Titus. 1.5, 7: but the name <a id="l49"></a>of Bishop in a little time became appropriated to the President. <a id="l50"></a>And when the Christians grew too numerous in any city to meet <a id="l51"></a>in one Church &amp; the Christian religion began to spread into the <a id="l52"></a>villages: the Council distinguished her government into Parishes. <a id="l53"></a>And such a Council of Elders was that at Ierusalem mentioned in the Acts <a id="l54"></a>of the Apostles; the first President thereof being Iames the bro<a id="l55"></a>ther of our Lord, &amp; the first Deacons being the seven mentioned <a id="l56"></a>in the Acts of the Apostles. But Councils of Bishops did not be<a id="l57"></a>gin to meet till towards the end of the second Century. For they <a id="l58"></a>could not  meet in Provincial Councils without the leave <a id="l59"></a>of the Roman governour of  the Province.</p>
<p id="par4">The first Council of this kind was a Council of 27 Bishops who <a id="l60"></a>met at Hieropolis in the Diocess of Asia about the beginning of the reign <a id="l61"></a>of the Emperor Commodus, wherein Apollinaris Bishop of that city presided. <a id="l62"></a>They met in opposition to the Cataphrygians a specious Sect which was then <a id="l63"></a>newly risen up, &amp; spread very fast. And from thence forward the Bishops <a id="l64"></a>began to meet in  Provincial Councills upon emergent occasions by <a id="l65"></a>the leave of the Roman Governours. And by this custome the Christian <a id="l66"></a>Church became divided into Provinces of the same extent with the Provin<a id="l67"></a>ces of the Roman Empire: &amp; the Bishops of the head cities of the Provin<a id="l68"></a>ces  who presided in the Councils, became exalted in dignity &amp; <a id="l69"></a>power over the rest of the Bishops of the Province over whome they <a id="l70"></a>presided in Council &amp; gained the names of Metropolitans, Archbishops &amp; Patriarchs. <a id="l71"></a>And the Bishop of Rome in the middle of the third Century or <a id="l72"></a>before began to call himself the Bishop of Bishops, meaning the <a id="l73"></a>President of the Council of the Suburbicarian Bishops, or Bishops <a id="l74"></a>within the Diocess of Rome. And in this state the Church continued <a id="l75"></a>till the Emperor Constantine the great having authority to give <a id="l76"></a>leave to the Bishops of all the Empire to meet in Council, called <a id="l77"></a>the Council of Nice which was the first General Council: &amp; this <a id="l78"></a>Council established the authority of  Metropolitans &amp; the meeting of <a id="l79"></a>Provincial Councils half yearly for governing the Provinces. <a id="l80"></a>And at length the Council of Constantinople called the second <a id="l81"></a>general Council, set the Bishop of Constantinople above all <a id="l82"></a>the Bishops within the Greek Empire because Constantinople <a id="l83"></a>was the Metropolis of that Empire as Rome was of the Em<a id="l84"></a>pire of the Latines.</p>
<p id="par5">The Apostle Paul distinguishes between the first Principles <a id="l85"></a>of the doctrine of Christ &amp; the things to be learned after the Prin<a id="l86"></a>ciples by comparing the former to milk for babes &amp; the latter <a id="l87"></a>to strong meats for men of full age &amp; describes the former to <a id="l88"></a>be <em class="underline">repentance from dead works</em> [or to forsake the devil &amp; all his <a id="l89"></a>works, the pomps &amp; vanities of the world &amp; the sinfull lusts of the flesh] <a id="l90"></a><em class="underline">faith towards God</em> [conteined in the Creed,] <em class="underline">the doctrine of Baptisms <a id="l91"></a>&amp; of laying on of hands, the resurrection from the dead &amp; eternal <a id="l92"></a>judgment</em>. These things were taught from the beginning in <a id="l93"></a>catechising, &amp; were thought sufficient for baptism into the remission <a id="l94"></a>of sins, &amp; by consequence for salvation. And nothing more was re<a id="l95"></a>quisite for admission into Communion by the laying on of hands. But <a id="l96"></a>after admission into communion there were other doctrines to be <a id="l97"></a>learnt which the Apostle compares to strong meats for men of full age. <a id="l98"></a>These men were to study them &amp; teach them to one another without breaking com<a id="l99"></a>munion or falling out about them. In these things the strong were <a id="l100"></a>not to despise the weak nor the weak to judge the strong. And in <a id="l101"></a>this state of charity the primitive Church continued for a time, <a id="l102"></a>especially among the Greeks. But before the end of the se<a id="l103"></a>cond Century the Latines began to forget the distinction <a id="l104"></a>between fundamentals &amp; customes or doctrines not fundamen<a id="l105"></a></p></div>

<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">Sect. VII. <a id="l106"></a><br>Of the King who doth according to his will, <a id="l107"></a>in relation to his honouring Mahuzzims.</h2>
<p id="par6">The Idolatry of the heathens consisted in giving honour <a id="l108"></a>&amp; worship to dead men &amp; to such things as were dedicated to them <a id="l109"></a>&amp; named from them &amp; as their souls or ghosts were feigned to <a id="l110"></a>reside in: as to the Sun, Moon, Starrs, Elements, Birds, Beasts, <a id="l111"></a>Fishes, Vegetables, Grave-stones or Altars, &amp; at length to pictures <a id="l112"></a>&amp; Statues with which their sepulchres were adorned. Families, Cities <a id="l113"></a>&amp; Kingdoms out of love or flattery built monuments &amp; altars <a id="l114"></a>to their dead ancestors &amp; kings (at first more rudely at length <a id="l115"></a>more sumptuously) &amp; appointed yearly monthly or daily solem<a id="l116"></a>nities with incense &amp; sacrifices &amp; various ceremonies &amp; myste<a id="l117"></a>ries &amp; initiations &amp; Priests to perform them, &amp; built Temples <a id="l118"></a>over the sepulchres of kings &amp; great men for people to meet <a id="l119"></a>in.  Whence it came to pass that the Gods were male &amp; female &amp; that every race of ancient kings <a id="l120"></a>sprang from the Gods &amp; that every kingdom &amp; every city <a id="l121"></a>had its proper Gods &amp; every family their Dij penates, &amp; that <a id="l122"></a>the Romans deified their Emperors. All the heathens agreed <a id="l123"></a>in religion in general &amp; differed only in their particular <a id="l124"></a>Gods, &amp; in some ceremonies of their worship: &amp; therefore <a id="l125"></a>upon being conquered by one another, the conquered people <a id="l126"></a>easily received the Gods of their conquerors. And thence it <a id="l127"></a>came to pass that when the heathens were conquered by the <a id="l128"></a>Christians</p></div>

<p id="par8">In scripture we are told of some trusting in God &amp; others trusting in Idols &amp; that <a id="l132"></a>God is our refuge, our strength, our defense. And in this sence God <a id="l133"></a>is called the rock of his people &amp; false Gods are called the rock of <a id="l134"></a>those that trust in them Deut. 32.4, 15, 18, 30, 31, 37. And in the same <a id="l135"></a>sense the Gods of the king who doth according to his will are called <a id="l136"></a>Mahuzzim strengths  munitions fortresses,  protectors. <em class="underline">In his estate</em> saith Daniel <em class="underline">shall he <a id="l137"></a>honour Mahuzzims</em> [  Guardians] <em class="underline">even with a God whom his <a id="l138"></a>fathers knew not shall he honour them with Gold &amp; Silver &amp; with <a id="l139"></a>precious stones &amp; things of value.

Now this came to pass in the following manner <a id="l142"></a>by steps</p>
<p id="par9">Gregory Nyssen tells us – were soon followed by <a id="l143"></a>the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="par10">In propagating these superstitions the ringleaders were the Moncks <a id="l144"></a>&amp; Antony was at the head of them. For in the end of the life of Antony <a id="l145"></a>Athanasius relates that these were his dying words to his disciples who <a id="l146"></a>then attended him. <em class="underline">Do you take care,</em> saith Antony, <em class="underline">to adhere to Christ <a id="l147"></a>in the first place &amp; then to the saints that after death they may receive <a id="l148"></a>you as friends &amp; acquaintance, into the eternal Tabernacle. Think <a id="l149"></a>upon these things, perceive these things, &amp; if you have any regard to me <a id="l150"></a>remember me as a father</em>.  This <a id="l152"></a>being delivered in charge to the Monks by Antony at his death  <a id="l153"></a>A.C. 356, could not but inflame the whole body of the Monks in devotion <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003v"> &lt;3v&gt; </span> towards the saints as the ready way to be received by them into the eternal taberna<a id="l154"></a>cles after death.

<p id="par20">The same religion of worshipping Mahuzzims quickly spread into the western Empire <a id="l179"></a>also: but Daniel  in this Prophesy describes only the things done among the <a id="l180"></a>nations comprehended in the body of his third Beast.</p>

<div><h2 id="hd4" class="cent">Sect. VII. <a id="l190"></a><br>Of the King who did according to his will, <a id="l191"></a>&amp; regarded not the desire of weomen.</h2>
<p id="par26">All the fundamental points of the Christian religion <a id="l192"></a>necessary to remission of sins, to communion, &amp; to salvation, <a id="l193"></a>are of divine authority &amp; were taught in plain words in the <a id="l194"></a>beginning of the Gospel in catechising before baptism &amp;  imposition of hands. For baptism was <a id="l196"></a>into the remission of sins, by imposition of hands men were ad<a id="l197"></a>mitted into communion, &amp; by remission of sins they were in a <a id="l198"></a>state of salvation.</p>
<p id="par27">These fundamentals were not to be altered. We were to <a id="l199"></a>hold fast even the form of sound words in which they were <a id="l200"></a>taught from the beginning.</p>
<p id="par28">By admission into communion upon certain Articles men enter into a covenant <a id="l201"></a>of enjoying communion so long as they keep to the  Articles <a id="l202"></a>upon which they were admitted into it: &amp; therefore to de<a id="l203"></a>prive them of communion without their breaking any <a id="l204"></a>of those  Articles, would be a breach of covenant. <a id="l205"></a>While they sincerely keep to all those conditions they con<a id="l206"></a>tinue in a state of salvation, &amp; such men are not to be <a id="l207"></a>excommunicated. To excommunicate or anathematize men <a id="l208"></a>for any thing which was not taught from the beginning in Cate<a id="l209"></a>chizing is to make a new fundamental Article of the Christian <a id="l210"></a>religion, a new covenant of communion, an Article which ought to be taught in catechizing <a id="l211"></a>before baptism into the remission of sins &amp; admission into com<a id="l212"></a>munion.</p>
<p id="par29">The Law of Moses was good if a man could keep it, but <a id="l213"></a>it was not necessary to salvation, &amp; therefore the Apostle would <a id="l214"></a>not suffer it to be imposed on the Gentiles as a fundamental <a id="l215"></a>Article of religion necessary to salvation; but said that <a id="l216"></a>such an imposition would be a making void the faith in <a id="l217"></a>Christ &amp; a preaching of another Gospel.  And the case is the same with every new <a id="l219"></a>Article of communion not imposed in a catechising before <a id="l220"></a>baptism from the beginning of the Gospel. It is not enough that it be true <a id="l221"></a>or good; it must be also necessary to salvation.</p>
<p id="par30"><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>The fundamental Articles of the Christian religion <a id="l223"></a>the Apostle calls milk for babes &amp; the first Principles of <a id="l224"></a>the Doctrine of Christ, &amp;  describes them to be <em class="underline">the foundation of re<a id="l225"></a>pentance from dead works &amp; of faith towards God, of the doctrine <a id="l226"></a>of Baptisms &amp; of laying on of hands, &amp; of resurrection of the <a id="l227"></a>dead &amp; of eternal judgment</em>. And all this was taught in cate<a id="l228"></a>chising. For by faith in God he means the faith conteined <a id="l229"></a>in the primitive Creed; &amp; by repentance from dead works <a id="l230"></a>he means what the Church of England in her Catechism calls forsaking the world of the flesh &amp; the Devil, that is <a id="l231"></a>the love   of the world, the unchastity of the <a id="l232"></a>flesh &amp; the worship of Idols. On this milk we feed till admission into <a id="l233"></a>communion, &amp; then we are to feed on strong meats &amp; grow in <a id="l234"></a>grace &amp; the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ; we are to study <a id="l235"></a>the scriptures &amp; learn higher truths &amp; teach them to one another, <a id="l236"></a>but not to fall out about them. The strong must not despise <a id="l237"></a>the weak &amp; the weak must not judge the strong: much less must they ana<a id="l238"></a>thematise &amp; excommunicate one another.</p>
<p id="par31">The primitive Christian religion was preserved entire in the <a id="l239"></a>Greek Church ( till the middle of the third Century <a id="l240"></a>or beginning of the fourth, but began to be violated by the Latines <a id="l241"></a>before the end of the second. For Pope Victor excommunicated the <a id="l242"></a>Churches of Asia for keeping Easter on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of the Moon <a id="l243"></a>&amp; thereby made it a fundamental Article of the Christian religion neces<a id="l244"></a>sary to salvation to keep Easter on the Sunday following that day. And in the third <a id="l245"></a>Century, Pope Stephen excommunicated those who disallowed the Baptism <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> performed by hereticks, ‡<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the top right of f 5v &gt; </span>‡ &amp; thereby made himself a <a id="l246"></a>schismatick <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> according to . <a id="l259"></a>Firmilian bishop of Cæsaria in <a id="l260"></a>Cappadocia.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 6r resumes &gt; </span> And the African Churches in Cyprians <a id="l261"></a>days<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> denyed baptism to those who <em class="underline">did not beleive in the remission <a id="l286"></a>of sins &amp; life everlasting through the holy Church</em>.

<p id="par34">Thus Councils of Bishops which were but of humane autho<a id="l291"></a>rity, assumed by degrees a power of making Canons or laws in <a id="l292"></a>matters of religion under pain of anathemas &amp; excommuni<a id="l293"></a>cations; &amp; at length by this power the seventh General <a id="l294"></a>Council established the worship of Images contrary to the <a id="l295"></a>second Commandment.

<p id="par45">[In the first ages of the Christian religion, the Christians <a id="l458"></a>of every city were governed by a Council of Presbyters, <a id="l459"></a>&amp; the President of the Council was the Bishop of the city. <a id="l460"></a>And the Bishop &amp; Presbyters of one city medled not with the <a id="l461"></a>affairs of another city except by admonitory Letters or Mes<a id="l462"></a>sages. Nor did the Bishops of several cities meet together in <a id="l463"></a>Councils before the reign of Emperor Commodus. For <a id="l464"></a>they could not meet without the leave of the Roman Gover<a id="l465"></a>nours of the Provinces. But in the reign of that Emperor <a id="l466"></a>they began to meet in Provincial Councils by the leave of <a id="l467"></a>the Governours, first in Asia in opposition to the Cataphrygian <a id="l468"></a>heresy, &amp; soon after in other places &amp; upon other occasions. <a id="l469"></a>And the Bishop of the head city or Metropolis of the Roman <a id="l470"></a>Province was usually made President of the Council. And <a id="l471"></a>hence came the authority of Metropolitan Bishops above <a id="l472"></a>that of the other bishops within the Province. Hence also <a id="l473"></a>it was that the Bishop of Rome in Cyprians days called himself <a id="l474"></a>the Bishop of Bishops. And as soon as the Empire became Christian, <a id="l475"></a>the Roman Emperors began to call General Councills out of <a id="l476"></a>all the Provinces of the Empire; &amp; by prescribing to them <a id="l477"></a>what points they should consider &amp; influencing them by their <a id="l478"></a>interest &amp; power; they set up what party they pleased, &amp; <a id="l479"></a>thereby the Greek Empire, upon the division of the Roman <a id="l480"></a>Empire into the Greek &amp; Latin Empires, became <em class="underline">the king who</em> <a id="l481"></a>[in matters of religion] <em class="underline">did according to his will, &amp;</em> [in legislature] <a id="l482"></a><em class="underline">exalted &amp; magnified himself above every God;</em> &amp; at length <a id="l483"></a>by the seventh General Council established the worship <a id="l484"></a>of the Images &amp; souls of dead men, here called <em class="underline">Mahuzzims</em>.</p>

But altho the followers of Tatian were at first con<a id="l510"></a>demned as hereticks by the name of Encratites or Continents: <a id="l511"></a>yet their principles could not be quite exploded.

The Apostolici about the middle <a id="l515"></a>of the third Century, condemned marriage, &amp; were a branch <a id="l516"></a>of the disciples of Tatian. The Hierocitæ in Egypt in the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> latter end of the third century also condemned marriage.

<p id="par47">Hitherto the Principles of the Encratites had been rejected by <a id="l521"></a>the Churches, but now being refined by the Monks &amp; imposed not upon <a id="l522"></a>all men but only upon those who would voluntarily undertake a mo<a id="l523"></a>nastic life, began to be admired ✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 9v &gt; </span>✝ especially by the heathens who flowed into the Christian religion now <a id="l524"></a>in fashion.

<p id="par69"> The Bishops of <a id="l814"></a>the primitive Christians  were Presidents of Councils of Presbyters  <a id="l815"></a> by which they governed each of them his <a id="l816"></a>city with the Villages thereof. And such a Council was that <a id="l817"></a>at Ierusalem mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles. And this <a id="l818"></a>form of Government lasted without any Councils  the Bishops of several cities till <a id="l819"></a>towards the end of the second Century. For the Bishops of several <a id="l820"></a>cities could not meet together in  Council without the leave of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015v"> &lt;15v&gt; </span> the Roman governour of  the Province or Diocess.  The first Council of this kind <a id="l823"></a>was a Council of 27 Bishops who met at Hierapolis in the Diocess of Asia about the beginning <a id="l824"></a>of the reign of Emperor Commodus wherein Apollinaris Bishop of that <a id="l825"></a> city presided. They met in opposition to the Cataphri<a id="l826"></a>gians a specious sect which was then newly risen up &amp; spread very <a id="l827"></a>fast. And from thence forward the Bishops began to meet in Provinci<a id="l828"></a>all Councils upon emergent occasions by the leave of the Roman <a id="l829"></a>governours. And by this custome the Churches became divided into <a id="l830"></a>Provinces &amp; Diocesses the names being taken from the  coextended Provin<a id="l831"></a>ces &amp; Diocesses of the Roman Empire. And the Bishops of the head <a id="l832"></a>cities of the Provinces who presided in the Councils, became exalted <a id="l833"></a>in dignity &amp; power over the rest of the Bishops of the Diocess or <a id="l834"></a>Province over whom they presided in Council &amp; gained the names <a id="l835"></a>of Archbishops &amp; Patriarchs, &amp; the Bishop of Rome in the <a id="l836"></a>middle of the third century began to call himself the Bishop <a id="l837"></a>of Bishops, meaning the President of the Council of the subur<a id="l838"></a>bicarian Bishops, or Bishops within the Diocess of Rome. And at <a id="l839"></a>length the Emperor Constantine having authority to give the <a id="l840"></a>Bishops leave to meet out of all the Empire, called the Council <a id="l841"></a>of Nice, which was the first general Council; &amp; this Council established <a id="l842"></a>the  authority of Patriarchs &amp; the meeting of Provincial Councils <a id="l843"></a>half yearly for governing the Provinces. And at length the <a id="l844"></a>Council of Constantinople called the second general Council, set up <a id="l845"></a>the Bishop of Constantinople above all the Bishops within the Greek <a id="l846"></a>Empire, because Constantinople was the Metropolis of that Empire, <a id="l847"></a>as Rome was of the  Empire of the Latines.</p>
<p id="par70">Now while Bishops could not meet in Councills without the <a id="l848"></a>leave of the civil government, &amp;  Emperors took upon them not only to give them leave to meet but even to <a id="l849"></a>call them together  at pleasure  &amp; dictate to them what points <a id="l850"></a> they should consider, &amp; the councills <a id="l851"></a>took upon them a legislative authority even in fundamentals:  for they took upon them at length <a id="l852"></a> to impose other articles of communion then those which from the beginning of the Gospel <a id="l853"></a>had been taught in Catechising &amp; imposed  on the Catechism before his admission into communion by <a id="l854"></a>baptism &amp; imposition of hands, &amp; which conteined all things necessary to communion:) <a id="l855"></a>the last horn – – <a id="l856"></a> last horn of the He Goat by this legislative powere be<a id="l875"></a>came able (in matters of religion) to do according to his will &amp; to exalt <a id="l876"></a>&amp; magnify himself above every God; &amp; at length ( in the seventh general <a id="l877"></a>Council,) set up the worship of Mahuzzims &amp; thereby forsook <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span> &amp; denyed <a id="l878"></a>the God above. Iob. 31.28. Deut. 32.15, 16, 17, 18. This power was exercised <a id="l879"></a>only in the Greek Empire. For the Latines became divided into many <a id="l880"></a>small kingdoms as above.</p>

<p id="par71">In the beginning of the Christian religion  the Christians of every city <a id="l881"></a>with its villages were governed by a board or Council of Elders or Presbyters with <a id="l882"></a>a President after the manner of the Iewish Synagogues. These Elders  are by <a id="l883"></a>the Apostle called Bishops, Titus 1.5, 7. But the name of Bishop in a little time became <a id="l884"></a>appropriated to the President.

<p id="par77">The Apostle Paul distinguishes between the first Principles of the doctrine of Christ <a id="l901"></a>&amp; the  remainder of that doctrine    by comparing the first to milk for <a id="l902"></a>babes &amp; the last to strong meats for  men of riper years, &amp; describing the first <a id="l903"></a>to be repentance from dead works, [or forsaking  the world the flesh &amp; the Devil conteined in the Creed) faith towards God, the doctrine of Baptisms, &amp; <a id="l904"></a>of laying on of hands, the resurrection from the dead &amp; eternal judgment.  And these were taught in <a id="l915"></a>catechising &amp; are sufficient for baptism into the remission of sins &amp; by consequence <a id="l916"></a>for salvation &amp; for admission into Communion. And in the two first ages of Christianity nothing more  then <a id="l917"></a>these principles was required  for admission into <a id="l918"></a>communion by baptism &amp; laying on of hands. The higher doctrines compared to <a id="l919"></a>strong meats for men of full age men were to study &amp; teach one another <a id="l920"></a>without breaking communion or falling out about them. In these things the <a id="l921"></a>strong were not to despise the weak nor the weak to judge the strong. In this <a id="l922"></a>state the Churches continued till  towards the end <a id="l923"></a>of the second Century but then the western Churches began to forget the distinction between <a id="l924"></a>fundamentals &amp;  customes or doctrines not fundamental,  &amp; to excommunicate one another for the latter as if they were <a id="l929"></a>fundamental. So Pope Victor excommunicated the Churches of Asia for keeping <a id="l930"></a>easter on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of the Moon.

And the Council of Eliberis in Spain A.C. 305 excommunicated those <a id="l934"></a>who in the day time lighted wax candles in the Cæmeteries or burying places, because the <a id="l935"></a>spirits of the dead saints were not to be disturbed.</p>

The horn was mighty by anothers <a id="l1100"></a>power Antiochus  acted by his own.

This kingdom by the revolt of <a id="l1131"></a>Philetærus from Lysimachus king of Thrace &amp; Phrygia came out <a id="l1132"></a>of one of the four horns. It arose in the northwest, &amp; was very <a id="l1133"></a>little at its first rise. But at length by the assistance of the Romans <a id="l1134"></a>it took from Antiochus the great all Asia minor on this side the <a id="l1135"></a>mountain Taurus. Afterwards it assisted the Romans in con<a id="l1136"></a>quering the kingdom of Macedon. Then it came under the power <a id="l1137"></a>of the Romans by the Legacy of Attalus its last king, &amp; thereby <a id="l1138"></a>the Senate of Rome  succeeded Attalus &amp; became <a id="l1139"></a>its king by right of inheritance; &amp; under their government it <a id="l1140"></a>grew mighty conquering Pontus Armenia, Syria, Iudæa &amp; Egypt, &amp; <a id="l1141"></a>continued mighty under them till the reign of Constantine the great <a id="l1142"></a>&amp; his sons. And then by the division of the Roman Empire into the Greek <a id="l1143"></a>&amp; Latin Empires, it separated from the Latines &amp; became the Greek – <a id="l1144"></a>Empire alone, but yet under the dominion of a Roman family, &amp; <a id="l1145"></a>continued still mighty, being the king who did according to his <a id="l1146"></a>will untill the king of the south (or Empire of the Saracens) <a id="l1147"></a>pushed at him, &amp; the king of the North (or Empire of the <a id="l1148"></a>Turks) overflowed &amp; conquered him. And at present he remains <a id="l1149"></a>under the power of the Turks: for all the four Beasts are <a id="l1150"></a>sill alive, tho the dominion of three first be taken away: And <a id="l1151"></a>the Goat still remains powerfull in his last horn, tho not by <a id="l1152"></a>his own power.</p>
<p id="par90">The last horn of the Goat is by some taken for Antiochus <a id="l1153"></a>Epiphanes, but not very judiciously. A horn of a Beast is <a id="l1154"></a>never taken for a single person. It always signifies a <a id="l1155"></a>kingdom &amp; a new horn signifies a new kingdom; &amp; the king<a id="l1156"></a>dom of Antiochus Epiphanes was an old one. Antiochus reigned <a id="l1157"></a>over one of the four horns &amp; the  little horn was a fift <a id="l1158"></a>under its proper kings. This horn was at first a little one <a id="l1159"></a>&amp; waxed exceeding great, &amp; so did not Antiochus. It is <a id="l1160"></a>described great above all the former horns &amp; so was not <a id="l1161"></a>Antiochus. His kingdom, on the contrary, was weak &amp; tribu<a id="l1162"></a>tary to the Romans, &amp; he did not enlarge it. The horn was <a id="l1163"></a>a king of fierce countenance &amp; destroyed wonderfully, &amp; <a id="l1164"></a>prospered in his practises against the holy people: but Anti<a id="l1165"></a>ochus was frighted out of Egypt by a mere message of the <a id="l1166"></a>Romans &amp; afterwards routed &amp; baffled by the Iews.

But they might come in a little <a id="l1185"></a>before. For We are told that the Lombards under their Captains Ibor &amp; <a id="l1186"></a>Ayon beat the Vandals in battel &amp; Prosper places this victory in the <a id="l1187"></a>Consulship of Ausonius &amp; Olybrius A.C. 379.  Before this war the Vandals had remained quiet forty <a id="l1190"></a>years in their seats granted them in Pannonia by Constantine <a id="l1191"></a>the Great &amp; therefore if these were the same Vandals this war was in Pannonia &amp;  might be occasi<a id="l1192"></a>oned by the coming of the Lombards over the Danube into Panno<a id="l1193"></a>nia a year or two before the battel, &amp; put an end to that quiet of the <a id="l1194"></a>Vandals which lasted 40 years. And after Gratian &amp; Theodosius had quieted <a id="l1195"></a>the  barbarians, they might either retire over the Danube  or continue quiet under <a id="l1196"></a>the Romans till after the death of Theodosius;  &amp; then either invade the Empire anew, or throw off all <a id="l1198"></a>subjection. By their warrs first with the Vandals &amp; then with <a id="l1199"></a>the Bulgars a Scythian nation so called from the river Volga from <a id="l1200"></a>whence they came: it appears that  even in those days they were a peo<a id="l1201"></a>ple not contemptible.</p>
<p id="par92">These Alans had also Gepides among them, &amp; therefore the Gepides <a id="l1202"></a>came into Pannonia before the Alans left it &amp; some of them went with the barbarous nations into Gallia A.C. 406.  But others <a id="l1203"></a>who  staid  in Pannonia,  became subject to the Hunns &amp; these remained <a id="l1205"></a>in subjection to them till the death of Attila, A.C. 454, &amp; at length were con<a id="l1206"></a>quered by the Ostrogoths.</p>

<p id="par94">The invocation of the Holy Ghost came into the Greek church <a id="l1214"></a>at the same time with the invocation of saints. It could not come <a id="l1215"></a>in later: for  no man that invoked the saints <a id="l1216"></a>would refuse to invoke the Holy Ghost. And I find no instance or mention <a id="l1217"></a>of invoking him before.  In the reign of Constantine the great &amp; <a id="l1218"></a>his sons all the disputes were about the consubstantiality of the <a id="l1219"></a>son: &amp; I meet with no contention about the consubstantiality &amp; worship <a id="l1220"></a>of the Holyghost before the death of the  Emperors Constantius &amp; the <a id="l1221"></a>reign of  Iulian the Apostate.
