<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">The Conclusion.</h2>
<p id="par1">The Apocalyps is a Prophesy of the same kind with those of Daniel &amp; in the <a id="l1"></a>same language, &amp; must be interpreted by comparing them.</p>
<p id="par2">The great red Dragon that old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan who hath his seat in Pergamus signifies the <a id="l2"></a>same thing with He-Goat in the reign of his last horn: namely the heathen Roman <a id="l3"></a>Empire with respect to the Eastern nations of Greece Asia minor, Syria &amp; Egypt <a id="l4"></a>represented by Daniels third Beast, &amp; <em class="underline">the Beast</em> which rose out of the sea or Abyss <a id="l5"></a> &amp; was like the <em class="underline">Leopard</em> &amp; had feet as the feet of the <em class="underline">Bear</em> &amp; a mouth like <a id="l6"></a>the mouth of the <em class="underline">Lyon</em> represents the same thing with  Daniels fourth <a id="l7"></a>Beast. All Daniels four Beasts are named together in contrary order Apoc. 13. 2, &amp; <a id="l8"></a>to signify that he is one of them &amp; he is put first to signify that he is the last. The Dragon &amp; this Beast have common heads <a id="l9"></a>&amp; horns with crowns upon the heads of the Dragon &amp; upon the horns of the Beast to signi<a id="l10"></a>fy that  the Dragon reigns in the heads &amp; the Beast in the horns. The Dragon <a id="l11"></a>includes the Beast during the reign of his first six heads &amp; then they separate &amp; the Dragō <a id="l12"></a>reigns apart in his seventh head &amp; the Beast reigns apart in his horns. This <a id="l13"></a>separation is made by steps. First the Beast  after he had been wounded to <a id="l14"></a>death by the sword of Constantius, revived at the division  of the Empire between Valentinian &amp; Valens then he rose out of Sea or Islands of the sea <a id="l15"></a>at the division of the Roman Empire between  Theodosius &amp; <a id="l16"></a>Gratian &amp; then he received the Dragons Throne &amp; power &amp; great authority at the <a id="l17"></a>division of the Empire between the sons of Theodosius the great. And at the <a id="l18"></a>same hour or time the ten horns received power as kings, the western <a id="l19"></a>Empire then becoming divided into ten kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par3">The Woman in heaven cloathed with the Sun  of righteousness &amp; the Moon of Iewish <a id="l20"></a>ceremonies under her feet &amp; a crown of twelve starrs (the twelve Apostles) <a id="l21"></a>on her head , is the primitive Church Catholick. In Dioclesians persecution <a id="l22"></a>she cried travailing in birth of a Christian Empire &amp; pained to be delivered <a id="l23"></a>And in that persecution the Dragon's tail drew the third part of the starrs <a id="l24"></a>of heaven &amp; cast them to the earth. And the woman brought forth <a id="l25"></a>a man child   all nations with <a id="l26"></a> who was caught up to &amp; to his throne to return in the end <a id="l27"></a>of ages &amp; rule all nations with a rod of iron.  And the woman fled into the wilderness. where she hath a place <a id="l29"></a>prepared of God that they should nourish her the a thousand two hundred &amp; sixty years. </p>
<p id="par4"> In Dioclesians persecution &amp; the times next after it there was <a id="l31"></a>war in heaven between Michael &amp; the Dragon,  that old serpent called <a id="l32"></a>the Devil &amp; Satan (the heathen dominion of Idolaters  which deceiveth the whole world <a id="l33"></a>was cast out of the Roman heaven to the earth, or common people &amp; his Angels (or heathen <a id="l34"></a>Emperors &amp; great men were cast out with him. And there was a loud <a id="l35"></a>voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation &amp; strength &amp; the kingdom <a id="l36"></a>of our God &amp; the power of his Christ. For the accuser of our brethren <a id="l37"></a>is cast out who accused them before God  day &amp; night.  And <a id="l38"></a>they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb &amp; by the word of their <a id="l39"></a>testimony. And they loved not their lives unto the death. But <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> be to the inhabitants of the earth  <a id="l40"></a>&amp; sea because the Devil of Idolatry is come down among  you <a id="l41"></a>having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short <a id="l42"></a>time. For by   crying up the miracles done by the reliques of the <a id="l43"></a>Martyrs &amp; dispersing those reliques into all the Roman Empire he <a id="l44"></a>set up Idolatry among the Christians, the heathens  who now came over to <a id="l45"></a>the Christian religion in great numbers &amp; readily promoting these <a id="l46"></a>superstitions.</p>
<p id="par5">And when the Dragon saw that he was cast down he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. And to the Woman by the division of <a id="l47"></a>the Roman Empire into the Greek &amp; Latine Empires was given two wings of <a id="l48"></a>a great Eagle that she might fly into the wilderness unto her place of riches <a id="l49"></a>&amp; honour in the great city Babylon seated on seven hills, &amp; reign over the  ten kings as is represented by their giving their power &amp; strength to the <a id="l51"></a>Beast on which she setteth. And there she is nourished  a time times &amp; half <a id="l52"></a>a time the face of the serpent, or at a distance from him, she flying from him into the Empire  of the Latines <a id="l54"></a>&amp; he remaining in the  Empire of the Greeks. And by the same division of the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> Empire the Dragon cast out waters as a flood  after the <a id="l55"></a>Woman  to cause her to be carried away of the flood <a id="l56"></a>And the earth (or Greek Empire) opened her mouth &amp; by the victory of Constantius <a id="l57"></a>over  Magnentius a heathen, swallowed up the flood &amp; wounded the Beast <a id="l58"></a>to death with a sword. And the Dragon was wroth with the woman in the reign <a id="l59"></a>of Iulian the Apostate, &amp; by a new division of the Empire went from the Woman <a id="l60"></a>&amp; her Beast to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the com<a id="l61"></a>mandments of God &amp; had the testimony of Iesus. And by consequence the Woman <a id="l62"></a> was the true Church catholick before her flight, &amp; by her flight separated <a id="l63"></a>from the true Church which kept the Commandments of God, &amp; after her flight  <a id="l64"></a>was an apostate hæretical Christian Church which forsook the Commandments of God &amp; flourished <a id="l65"></a>in the regions of the Beast &amp; sat upon him as we find a little after. And at the <a id="l66"></a>next division of the Empire which was between Gratian &amp; Theodosius, the Beast whose <a id="l67"></a>deadly wound was newly healed rose up out of the sea with seven heads &amp; ten horns &amp; ten <a id="l68"></a>crowns upon his horns.  And the Dragon by a final <a id="l69"></a>division of the Empire between the sons of Theodosius, gave the Beast his old <a id="l70"></a>power &amp; throne &amp; great authority over the  western nations.  And the ten horns of the Beast <a id="l72"></a>which had received no kingdoms as yet, received power as kings the same hour with <a id="l73"></a>the Beast or within a  very short time as it were an hour after him. For <a id="l74"></a>within 12 or 15 years after the death of Theodosius they were all arisen with crowns on <a id="l75"></a> them.</p>
<p id="par6">And when the Dragon went to make war with the remnant of the womans seed a <a id="l76"></a> another Beast came up out of the earth &amp; had two horns like the Lamb being headed <a id="l77"></a>by two principal Churches like the seven churches of Asia which were the  seven <a id="l78"></a>horns of the Lamb.  This Beast was therefore an <a id="l79"></a>ecclesiastical body. And he spake as the Dragon being his Church, as the Woman <a id="l80"></a>is the Church of the Beast. And he causeth the  Earth (or nations of <a id="l81"></a>the Greek Empire) to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed, that is <a id="l82"></a>to  venerate his authority in matters of religion, &amp; doth great wonders so that he <a id="l83"></a>maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, the fire of a <a id="l84"></a>lighted torch which the Priest swings down from above his head in excommunicating those <a id="l85"></a>who will not worship the first Beast, &amp; he  said unto them that dwell on the <a id="l86"></a>earth  that they should make an image  to the Beast that is that they should call a <a id="l87"></a>Council of those who are of the Beasts religion for selling up that religion in <a id="l88"></a>the  Dragon dominions. And he gave life to the Image of the Beast,  so that <a id="l89"></a>the Image should speak &amp; cause that as many as would no worship the Image <a id="l90"></a>should be killed, that is that all the churches  should be dissolved who would <a id="l91"></a>not  receive the religion of the first Beast set up by the authority of <a id="l92"></a>the Image. And he causeth all both small and great rich &amp; poor, free &amp; bond to <a id="l93"></a>receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead, the signe of the cross <a id="l94"></a>&amp; that no man might buy or sell save him that had the mark or name of the <a id="l95"></a>Beast or number of his name, all the rest being excommunicated. And his <a id="l96"></a>number is 666. And those that received not his name or number were 144000 <a id="l97"></a>standing on mount Sion with the Lamb, having  his fathers name on their fore<a id="l98"></a>head.  These were the 144000 sealed out of all the twelve tribes of Israel with <a id="l99"></a>the seale of God in their foreheads, just before the Earth was hurt at the <a id="l100"></a>sounding of the first Trumpet &amp; the sea at the sounding of the second. The earth <a id="l101"></a>&amp; the  I take here almost in the sense of the Iews who by the earth <a id="l102"></a>understood  the great continent of Egypt, Syria, &amp; all Asia &amp; by the Isles of the sea <a id="l103"></a>the regions of Europe. By the sea therefore I understand in this Prophesy the nations of Europe  <a id="l104"></a>within the western Empire &amp; by the  Earth the nations within the Eastern.  <a id="l105"></a> But when a third part of the Earth or Sea is mentioned I consider the <a id="l106"></a>whole scene of Daniels Prophesies as divided into three parts one of which comprehends the <a id="l107"></a>nations  represented by his two first Beasts beyond Euphrates, another <a id="l108"></a>those represented by his third Beast, &amp; the third those represented by his fourth Beast. <a id="l109"></a>&amp; by a third part of the earth or sea understand one of these three parts. And  <a id="l110"></a>so  a third part of the rivers or starrs or  Sun &amp; Moon are a the Rivers or Starrs <a id="l111"></a> or Sun &amp; Moon of a third part.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p002v"> &lt;2v&gt; </span>
<p id="par7">– &amp; thereby becomes a horn of the Beast represented in Daniel by the <a id="l112"></a>eleventh horn of this fourth Beast, &amp; with a look more stout then the rest <a id="l113"></a>reigns over them; &amp; is therefore represented in Iohn as sitting upon the Beast, that is, reigning over him. And all the time of her reign, the two witnesses <a id="l114"></a>prophesy in sackcloth.</p>
<p id="par8">These witnesses are called two Olive trees &amp; an Olive trees  is by the Apo<a id="l115"></a>stle Paul put for a Church Rom. XI. In Zachary (ch.  IV)  two <a id="l116"></a>Olive branches feed the Lamps with oyle. They are called also two Candlesticks <a id="l117"></a> standing before God, that is two of the seven golden candlesticks which <a id="l118"></a>had been placed in the first Temple. Five of those  seven Candlesticks  or Churches were found faulty &amp; threatned if they did not repent. The other <a id="l119"></a>two, viz<sup>t</sup> the churches of Smyrna &amp; Philadelphia, were without fault.  <a id="l120"></a> &amp; so were fit to be placed in the second temple <a id="l121"></a>They were in a state of tribulation &amp; persecution &amp; the only two of the seven <a id="l122"></a>in such a state &amp; so were fit to represent the Churches in affliction  in <a id="l123"></a>the time of the second Temple.</p>

<p id="par9">The affairs of the Church begin to be considered at the opening of the 5<sup>t</sup>S. <a id="l124"></a>as was said above. And then she is represented by a Woman in the Temple of <a id="l125"></a><em class="underline">heaven</em> cloathed - </p>
<p id="par10">And at length the Woman arrived at her place of riches honour &amp; dominion  <a id="l126"></a>upon the back of the Beast, where she is nourished for a time  times &amp;  <a id="l127"></a>half a time  from the face of the Serpent, not in his kingdom but at a distance <a id="l128"></a>from him. She is nourished by the Merchants of the earth, three times or years &amp; <a id="l129"></a>an half or 42 months or 1260 days, &amp; in these prophesies a day  is put <a id="l130"></a>for a solar year. During all this time  the Beast made war &amp; she sat up on  him, that is <a id="l131"></a>reigned over him &amp; over the ten kings who gave their kingdom to him. And <a id="l132"></a>by all these circumstances she is the eleventh horn  of Daniels fourth <a id="l133"></a>Beast, who reigned with a look more stout then the other ten &amp; was of <a id="l134"></a>a different kind from the rest having eyes &amp; a mouth like the woman &amp; lo being both male &amp; female civil &amp; Ecclesiastical, &amp; made war with <a id="l135"></a>the saints &amp; prevailed against them &amp; wore them out &amp; had times &amp; laws given <a id="l136"></a>into his had untill a time times &amp; half a time. The characters of the women <a id="l137"></a>&amp; little horn agree perfectly.  In respect of her temporal dominion she <a id="l138"></a>was a horn of the Beast, in respect of his spiritual dominion she was his Church <a id="l139"></a>&amp;  rode upon him, &amp; committed fornication with the ten kings.</p>
<p id="par11">And the second Beast which rose up out of the earth was the Church of the Greek Empire. For it had two horns like those of the Lamb &amp; therefore was a Church <a id="l140"></a>&amp; it spoke as the Dragon &amp; therefore was of the Dragons religion. It is <a id="l141"></a>called also the fals Prophet that wrought miracles before the first Beast <a id="l142"></a>with which he deceived them that received the mark of the Beast &amp; worshipped <a id="l143"></a>his Image. When the Dragon went from the Woman to make war upon <a id="l144"></a>the remnant of her seed, this Beast rising out of the earth assisted the Dragon <a id="l145"></a>in that war, &amp; caused the earth &amp; them that dwell therein to worship the  <a id="l146"></a>authority of the first Beast &amp; to make an Image to him that is a convention like him in  religion, &amp; gave life to the <a id="l147"></a>Image so that it could speak &amp;  (by excommunication)  cause all <a id="l148"></a>men to be (mystically killed who would not worship it. And he causeth all men to <a id="l149"></a>receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead &amp; that no man might <a id="l150"></a>buy or sell save  he that had the mark or the name of the Beast or the number <a id="l151"></a>of his name, all the rest being excommunicated. Thus the Woman fled from the first Temple into the Wilderness of Arabia  towards Babylon &amp; the Dragon by the <a id="l152"></a>assistance of the two horned Beast made war upon the remnant of the <a id="l153"></a>Womans seed &amp; &amp; the first Temple being destroyed a new one was built the Gentiles took possession of the outward court of the Temple, <a id="l154"></a>&amp; trode the holy city under foot &amp; out of all the twelve tribes of Israel [represented by that remnant] there were <a id="l155"></a>only 144000 sealed with the name of God in their foreheads, &amp; these worship<a id="l156"></a>ped in the Inner court called the new Court  &amp; the Court of the weomen <a id="l157"></a>&amp; appears to Iohn in this Court standing on Mount Sion with the Lamb &amp; (as <a id="l158"></a>it were) on the sea of glass. These are the saints of the most high &amp; the <a id="l159"></a>host of heaven &amp; the holy people spoken of by Daniel, as  worn out trampled un<a id="l160"></a>der foot &amp; destroyed in who were to be oppressed in <a id="l161"></a>the latter times by the little horns of Daniels fourth Beast &amp; He-Goat.</p>
<p id="par12">And while the Gentiles tread the holy city under foot, God gives power to his <a id="l162"></a>two Witnesses &amp; they  prophesy in sackcloth. They are called the two Olive trees <a id="l163"></a>with relation to the two Olive trees which in Zecharies Visions (ch. 4) stand on either <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span> side of the golden Candlestick to supply the lamps with oyle, &amp;  <a id="l164"></a>Olive trees according to the Apostle Paul represent Churches Rom.

Five of <a id="l167"></a>those Churches were found faulty &amp; threatned if they did not  Repent. The other two <a id="l168"></a> viz<sup>t</sup> the Churches of Smyrna &amp; Philadelphia were  without fault <a id="l169"></a>&amp; in a state of Persecution &amp; so were fit to be placed in the second Temple.  </p>
<p id="par13">were without fault, &amp; so their Candlesticks were fit to be placed in the second Temple. They were <a id="l180"></a>in a state of tribulation &amp; persecution &amp; the only two of the seven in such a state <a id="l181"></a>&amp; so were fit to represent the Churches in affliction in the times of the second <a id="l182"></a>Temple. The two witnesses are not new Churches:  They are the posterity of the primitive <a id="l183"></a>Church, &amp; so were fitly represented by two of the primitive Candlesticks. Con<a id="l184"></a>ceive therefore that where the first Temple was destroyed &amp; a new one built  two of the seven <a id="l185"></a>Candlesticks were placed in the second.</p>

<h2 id="hd4" class="cent">The Introduction.</h2>
<p id="par22">When the Romans made war upon the Iews in Iudea Iohn &amp; Peter retired with many of the Christian Iews <a id="l316"></a>into Asia minor,  &amp; the Romans looking upon all the Iews as enemies of the Empire secured the <a id="l317"></a>heads of them &amp; banished Iohn into Patmos &amp; there he wrote his Apocalyps   a little before the end of Nero's reign, as  the Syriac version, Arethas, Eusebius &amp; <a id="l319"></a>Pseudo <span class="hspac-n" title="1 word space left blank.">&nbsp;</span> testify. Whence this book is fuller of Hebraisms then the Gospel which was written <a id="l320"></a>long after, &amp; the style of his Gospel by the use of many Apocalyptic expressions is more lofty <a id="l321"></a>then that of the other Evangelists. Peter stayed not in  Asia but went on to Rome where <a id="l322"></a>he wrote his two Epistles to the dispersed Christian Iews   directing the first of them to the strangers scattered throughout <a id="l323"></a>Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia &amp; Bithynia, &amp; calls their suffering a fiery trial.  Paul  was an Apostle of the uncircumcision as Peter of the circumcision &amp; had planted the churches of <a id="l325"></a>Asia among the Gentiles but now  the Christian Iews being dispersed into those parts he wrote his <a id="l326"></a>Epistle to the Hebrews  in a differing stile from that of his other Epistles exhorting them to endure chastening <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>that<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> at present it seemeth grievous &amp; telling them that they had not yet resisted unto blood. For this Epistle was written not to the <a id="l327"></a>Hebrews in Iudea but to those in Asia as I gather by his telling them that the brother Timothy was set at <a id="l328"></a>liberty which Timothy was Bishop of Ephesus &amp; had nothing to do in Iudea. &amp; by Peters telling those to whom he wrote that Paul had written to them.  By these Epistles it seems to me that Peter &amp; <a id="l329"></a>Paul had studied the Apocalyps, there being many things in these Epistles relating to it, As in the Epistle to the <a id="l330"></a>Hebrews, the  σαββατισμος  <em class="underline">or day of rest</em> which is the 1000 years, <em class="underline">the word of God sharper then a two edged sword</em> discourses on the great <em class="underline">high Priest</em>, on the frame of the <em class="underline">Temple</em> &amp; on <em class="underline">Sacrifices</em> therein; <em class="underline">the  heavenly city <a id="l331"></a>which hath foundations whose builder is God,</em>  <em class="underline">a cloud of witnesses</em> (a phrase peculiar to the Apocalyps);  <em class="underline">the coming to mount Sion <a id="l332"></a>unto the city of the living God the heavenly Ierusalem &amp; to an innumerable company of Angels &amp; to <a id="l333"></a>the general assembly &amp; to God the judge of all,</em> &amp; <em class="underline">the shaking of the heaven &amp; earth</em> &amp; <em class="underline">removing them <a id="l334"></a>that we may receive a kingdom</em> [in a new heaven &amp; earth] <sup>which cannot be moved.</sup> In the firs Epistle <a id="l335"></a>to Peter the <em class="underline">inheritance incorruptible reserved in the heavens ready to be revealed in the last time, <a id="l336"></a>redemption by the pretious blood of Christ as of a Lamb without blemish</em>, the <em class="underline">royal Priesthood</em> &amp; the <a id="l337"></a>Church which is at <em class="underline">Babylon.</em> Peter calls Rome Babylon because it  is called Babylon in the Apo<a id="l339"></a> &amp; was then besieging &amp; captivating the Iews as old Babylon had done before. And further in the second epistle <a id="l340"></a>there is this exhortation to study the Apocalyps. For making known the power &amp; coming of our Lord we <a id="l341"></a>heard the voice from heaven when we were with him in the holy mount saying this is my beloved son in <a id="l342"></a>whom I am well pleased: <em class="underline">We have also a more sure word of Prophesy whereunto y<sup>e</sup> do well to take heed as <a id="l343"></a>unto a light  that shineth in a dark place untill</em> [by the gradually fulfilling &amp;  interpreting thereof] <em class="underline">the  day <a id="l344"></a>down  &amp; the day star arise in your hearts: knowing this first that</em> [you are not to <a id="l345"></a>expect the interpretation from Iohn the Prophet, but to study it your selves, for] <em class="underline">no prophesy of <a id="l346"></a>the scriptures is of the Prophets own interpretation: For the Prophesy came not of old by the will <a id="l347"></a>of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy ghost.</em> And the remainder <a id="l348"></a>of this Epistle seems to be a continual commentary on this prophesy, describing  how <em class="underline">fals Prophets</em> &amp; fals <em class="underline">teachers</em> <a id="l349"></a> should arise &amp; how their followers should <em class="underline">blaspheme the truth</em> &amp; make <em class="underline">merchandise</em> of  Christians &amp; <a id="l350"></a>should perish like <em class="underline">Sodom</em>,  <em class="underline">blaspheming glories,</em> being as <em class="underline">natural brute Beasts made to be <a id="l351"></a>taken &amp; destroyed</em>, counting it pleasure to riot &amp; sport in <em class="underline">feasting</em>, having eyes <em class="underline">full of an Adulteress,</em> &amp; following <a id="l352"></a>the way of <em class="underline">Balaam.</em> And that there shall come in the last days scoffers saying, where is the promise of his <a id="l353"></a>coming? for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the  beginning of the cre<a id="l354"></a>ation:  where as with the Lord a <em class="underline">thousand years</em> [mentions in the Apocalyps] is as one day &amp; the day of the Lord will <em class="underline">come as a thief</em> in which the <em class="underline">heavens shall <a id="l355"></a>pass away</em>, &amp; we, according to his promise,  look for <em class="underline">new heavens &amp; a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.</em></p>
<p id="par23">This Prophesy as it was studied by the Apostles, so it was at first generally received in the Churches for the first <a id="l356"></a>200 years,  commented upon by</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span>

<p id="par24">And as the true gospels gave occasion to many false gospels &amp; the true Acts of the Apostles to many <a id="l357"></a>false Acts: so there were many false Apocalypses which would never have been written had there not <a id="l358"></a>been a true one.</p>

<p id="par26">Dionysius of Alexandria so far as I can find was the first that questioned it &amp; he did not question  its <a id="l359"></a> being received by tradition, nor durst oppose it openly it being then generally received, but comple<a id="l360"></a>mented it &amp; tried to undermine it by pretending that it differed in style from Iohn's Gospel &amp; therefore <a id="l361"></a>was writ by another Iohn. Which being a frivolous objection the followers of Dionysius are not to be <a id="l362"></a>regarded  calling it in question. All the difference in style is that the Apoca<a id="l364"></a>lyps has more hebraisms then the Gospel being writ when Iohn came newly out of Iudea &amp; that the <a id="l365"></a> it is a Prophesy writ in the mystical style of the Prophets  by an extraordinary impulse of the <a id="l366"></a>spirit, &amp; the Gospel  a plain history. In all the new Testament there is no book <a id="l367"></a>which approaches the lofty style of the Apocalyps more nearly then the Gospel &amp; Epistles <a id="l368"></a>of Iohn.  The Gospel begins thus: <em class="underline">In the begin<a id="l369"></a>ning was the word &amp; the word was with God &amp; the word was God. The same was in the begin<a id="l370"></a>ing with God. All things were made by him &amp; without him was nothing made that was made <a id="l371"></a>In him  was life &amp; the life is the light of  men. And the light shineth in darkness <a id="l372"></a>&amp; the darkness comprehendeth it not. There was a man sent from God whose name was Iohn <a id="l373"></a>The same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him <a id="l374"></a>might believe. He was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light. That <a id="l375"></a>was the true light which lightneth every man that cometh into the world. -  #<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from higher up f 6r &gt; </span># The only begotten son who is in the bosom of the father - the Lamb of God who taketh <a id="l376"></a>away the sins of the world - He that came down from heaven - the bridegroom</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from lower down f 6r resumes &gt; </span> <a id="l377"></a> Iohn seeth Iesus coming into him &amp; saith <em class="underline">Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the <a id="l378"></a>sins of the world.</em> And  is not all this very style &amp; language of the Apocalyps <a id="l379"></a>where Christ is called the son of God <em class="underline">the Word of God</em> &amp; <em class="underline">the faithful &amp; true witness</em> <em class="underline">the beginning of the creation of God</em> &amp; <em class="underline">the first <a id="l380"></a>&amp; the last</em> &amp; <em class="underline">he that is alive for evermore</em> &amp; the <em class="underline">light of the new Ierusalem</em> his face being as the Sun &amp; <em class="underline">the Lamb</em> <a id="l381"></a> <em class="underline">who was slain &amp; hath redeemed us to God by his blood,</em> &amp; <em class="underline">washed  us from our</em>  <a id="l382"></a><em class="underline">sins in his own blood,</em> And before whom the  people represented by the four Beasts <a id="l383"></a>&amp; 24 Elders <em class="underline">fall down &amp; worship:</em> &amp; whose Bride is the new Ierusalem: &amp; who in form of a mighty Angel came  of all which Iohn <em class="underline">bare witness</em> &amp; Iesus sent his Angel to <em class="underline">testify</em> <a id="l384"></a>down from heaven &amp; enlightned the earth with his love these things in the churches &amp; his people have the <em class="underline">testimony</em> of Iesus .  And <a id="l389"></a>as Iohn's Gospel begins entirely in the style of the Apocalyps so doth his first <a id="l390"></a>Epistle: <em class="underline">That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen <a id="l391"></a>with our eyes, which we have looked upon, which we have handled of the Word of <a id="l392"></a>life: for the life was manifested &amp; we have seen it &amp; bear witness &amp; <a id="l393"></a>shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father</em> &amp;c.</p>
<p id="par27">This Prophesy was so far from being written by any other Iohn then the Apostle <a id="l394"></a>that  the Lamb alone was  declared worthy to receive it of God. It is  entituled <em class="underline">The <a id="l395"></a>Revelation of Iesus Christ which God gave unto him.</em> He alone was worthy to re<a id="l396"></a>ceive it of God <em class="underline">&amp; he sent his Angel</em> the most worthy to receive it from him <a id="l397"></a><em class="underline">&amp; shewed it unto his  servant Iohn</em> the most worthy among men, <em class="underline">who bare <a id="l398"></a>record of the word of God &amp; of the testimony of Iesus Christ &amp; of all that he <a id="l399"></a>saw.</em> To attribute it to any other Angel then the spirit of truth or to any other <a id="l400"></a>Iohn then the disciple whom Iesus loved is to weaken the testimony &amp;  <a id="l401"></a>undermine the credit of the Prophesy.  Christ himself is sometimes called an Angel. For in this <a id="l402"></a>Prophesy he is the mighty Angel who appears cloathed with a cloud &amp; a rainbow about his head <a id="l403"></a>&amp; his face as the sun &amp; his feet as pillars of fire &amp; a little book of prophesy in his hand. And <a id="l404"></a>in Daniel he is called Michael the great Prince (or Messiah) who is set over the children of Israel &amp; shall <a id="l405"></a>stand up at the resurrection of those that sleep in the dust, &amp; who alone holdeth in matters of prophesy <a id="l406"></a>with the Angel who was sent to inspire Daniel with the prophesy of the scripture of truth. An Angel <a id="l407"></a>signifies a Messenger, &amp;  the son is sent by the father &amp; the Spirit of truth by the <a id="l408"></a>son from the father &amp; all the Prophets were sent by the spirit of truth. The Law it self was given to Moses  by an <a id="l409"></a>Angel in Mount Sina Act. 7. 38.  The Spirit of truth puts on various forms &amp; when ever he ap<a id="l410"></a>peared in an humane form  he is called  an Angel, &amp; sometimes a Man. This Angel in a <a id="l411"></a>sevenfold form is the seven spirits before the throne from whom Iohn wishes Grace &amp; Peace to the <a id="l412"></a>Churches. He inspired Iohn with this Prophesy for Iohn saith I was in the Spirit of the Lords  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006v"> &lt;6v&gt; </span> <em class="underline">day</em>; and again, <em class="underline">immediately I was in the spirit.</em> Iohn calls him the spirit <a id="l413"></a>in saying <em class="underline">He that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith <a id="l414"></a>unto the Churches.</em> And, <em class="underline">The Lord God of the Holy Prophets sent his Angel <a id="l415"></a>to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done,</em> that is, God <a id="l416"></a>spoke to Iohn by the same spirit by which he spoke to the holy prophets. And <a id="l417"></a>again, <em class="underline">I Iesus have sent mine Angel to testify unto you these things in the Chur<a id="l418"></a>ches</em>: And what Angel so fit a witness as the spirit of truth?

It has many references to Daniel &amp; the old Prophets for explaining them  <a id="l445"></a>after it has been explained it self by the event of things:   by which means in the time of the end knowledge is to be encreased &amp; <a id="l446"></a>the everlasting Gospel is to be preached in all nations so that the wise shall understand but none of the wicked shall understand.  It is that Gospel by  the preaching of which the <a id="l447"></a> the witnesses are to ascend up to heaven in a cloud &amp; the kingdoms of this <a id="l448"></a>world are to become the kingdoms of our Lord &amp; his Christ  who shall <a id="l449"></a>reign for ever &amp; ever. And therefore it was not without cause that Iohn <a id="l450"></a>tells us: Blessed is – –<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 6v resumes &gt; </span> And there<a id="l451"></a>fore 'twas not without a cause that Iohn tells us <em class="underline">Blessed is he that  readeth &amp; <a id="l452"></a>they that hear the words of this Prophesy &amp; keep those things that are written <a id="l453"></a>therein. And, He that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the Chur<a id="l454"></a>ches.</em> And, <em class="underline">if any man shall add to these things God shall add to him the plagues  <a id="l455"></a> that are written in this Book: &amp; if any man shall take from the words <a id="l456"></a>of this Book God shall take  away his part out of the Book of life.</em> <a id="l457"></a>there is no book in all the scriptures so much recommended &amp; guarded by providence <a id="l458"></a>as this. And if they  that add to it or take from it are thus threatned, how can they be secure innocent  <a id="l459"></a>that   reject it, undermine it or weaken its authority.</p>
<p id="par29">It is said to be of things which must shortly come to pass &amp; that <a id="l460"></a>the time is at hand. For it began to be fulfilled from the time <a id="l461"></a>that it was written &amp;    conteins one <a id="l462"></a>period of a 1000 years, another of a time times &amp; half which is the <a id="l463"></a>main period of Daniels fourth Beast &amp; therefore concerns a long <a id="l464"></a>time, &amp; may extend to the second coming of Christ  the day of <a id="l465"></a>Iudgment &amp; the new heavens &amp; new earth, as it really doth:  all which <a id="l466"></a>time tho it may seem long to scoffers, yet is with the Lord a <a id="l467"></a>short time &amp; but as one day.</p>

<p id="par39">And this was the state of the Apocalyps till the 1000 years being misunderstood <a id="l474"></a>brought a prejudice against this book.  Dionysius of Alexandria so far as I can find <a id="l475"></a>was the first that questioned it; &amp; he did not question its being received by tradi<a id="l476"></a>tion, nor durst oppose it openly it being then generally received, but comple<a id="l477"></a>mented it &amp; tried to weaken its authority by pretending that it differed in <a id="l478"></a>style from Iohn's Gospel being fuller of  Barbarisms, &amp; therefore was <a id="l479"></a>written by another Iohn. Which being a frivolous objection the followers of <a id="l480"></a>Dionysius are not to be regarded. All the difference ------ &amp; but as one day.</p>
