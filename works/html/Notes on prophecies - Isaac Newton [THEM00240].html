<p id="par1" class="i0">D<sup>r</sup> Tillotson late Arch-Bishop of Cant. in his 2<sup>d</sup> sermon concerning <a id="l1"></a>the Divinity of our B. Saviour, p. 90, hath these words</p>
<p id="par2">And that he was not  only with God before he assumed <a id="l2"></a>humane nature but also was really God S<sup>t</sup> Paul tells us: <em class="underline">Let this <a id="l3"></a>mind be in you which was also in Christ Iesus who being in the form <a id="l4"></a>of God ὀυχ᾽ ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγήσατο, did not arrogate to himself to be <a id="l5"></a>equal with God</em>, that is, he made no ostentation of his Divinity. <a id="l6"></a>For this I take to be the true meaning of the phrase, both because <a id="l7"></a>it is so used by Plutarch, &amp; because it makes the sense more <a id="l8"></a>easy &amp; current, thus, who being in the form of God did not assume <a id="l9"></a>an equality with God, that is he did not appear in the glory of his <a id="l10"></a>Divinity which was hid under a veil of humane flesh &amp; infirmity <a id="l11"></a>&amp;c.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; insertion from f 2v &gt; </span><p id="par3" class="i0">– Ian 13, &amp; therefore the ten horns were now to receive power as kings. <a id="l12"></a> &amp; accordingly the Empire began at this very time to break into  ten kingdoms <a id="l13"></a> [And first the Dragon by giving the Beast his power &amp; throne became one of <a id="l14"></a>his horns.  ffor the ten horns are kings which give their power &amp; strength to the Beast <a id="l15"></a>(Apoc. 17.13.) &amp; power was given to the Beast over all kindreds &amp; tongues &amp; nations &amp; <a id="l16"></a>all that dwelt upon the earth worshipped him whose names were not written in the <a id="l17"></a>book of life.  The same year] For the Visigoths under the conduct of Alaricus rose from their <a id="l18"></a>seats in Thrace presently after the death of Theodosius &amp; made war upon the Empire, &amp; at length seated themselves in Gallia &amp; <a id="l19"></a>Spain.  The same yeare the Hunns Alans &amp; Vandals rose up in arms &amp; began to make <a id="l20"></a>war upon the Empire &amp; so did the Suevians the same year or soon after &amp; these nations <a id="l21"></a>marching to the   Burgundians upon the Rhene joyned them,  passed the <a id="l22"></a>Rhene at Ments, invaded Gallia put the Salian Franks into commotion &amp; gave occasion to the revolt of <a id="l23"></a>Britain &amp; after some wars seated them selves in various parts of ffrance &amp; Spain.  And <a id="l24"></a> these ten kingdoms (one of the   western Empire  one of the Visigoths, one of the Hunns , one of the Vandals, two of the Alans <a id="l25"></a>one of the Sweves one of the Burgundians, one of the Franks,  &amp;  one of the Britains)  received power as kings most <a id="l27"></a>of them upon the death of Theodosius &amp; the rest within the space of 12 or 13 years <a id="l28"></a>after his death, the Empire breaking into these ten kingdoms by  one continued series of <a id="l29"></a>war, as hath been explained above.  As the Leopard . . . . . her Beast.</p>
<p id="par4">Yet considering that the ten horns are ten kings which  agree &amp; give their <a id="l30"></a> power &amp; strength unto the Beast &amp; that the Dragon gave the Beast his power &amp; throne &amp; great <a id="l31"></a>authority &amp; that  power was given to the Beast over all kindreds &amp; tongues &amp; <a id="l32"></a>nations &amp; all that dwelt upon the earth worshipped him whose names were not <a id="l33"></a>written in the book of life: we may in some sense reccon that the Dragon when he <a id="l34"></a>gave the beast his power &amp; throne became one of his horns.  And in this sense the western <a id="l35"></a>Empire may be considered not as one of the horns but as the body of the Beast <a id="l36"></a>to whom the ten kings give their power &amp; strength.  And where its said  <em class="underline">I saw <a id="l37"></a>the Beast &amp; the kings of the earth &amp; their armies  gathered together</em> &amp;c (Apoc <a id="l38"></a>19.19) the Beast &amp; the kings of the earth may be taken for the body of the Beast &amp; <a id="l39"></a>his horns.  But whether the kings of the earth are the horns of the Beast or the kings <a id="l40"></a>of the east,  or what is to be understood by them, time will dis<a id="l41"></a>cover.  At present  I observe that after it is said that the Dragon gave the <a id="l42"></a>Beast his throne &amp; power &amp; great authority &amp; that all the world wondred after the Beast it <a id="l43"></a>is added in the next words that <em class="underline">they wor</em><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 2r resumes &gt; </span><em class="underline">shipped the Dragon which gave power unto the Beast, &amp; they worshipped the Beast <a id="l44"></a>saying, Who is like unto the Beast? Who is able to make war with him?  And by these <a id="l45"></a>words the Dragon &amp; Beast are still considered as two distinct  bodies &amp; the <a id="l46"></a>Greek Empire still continues to be the Dragon, &amp; the power of the Beast is uni<a id="l47"></a>versal only in respect of his worship.  After his resurrection from the dead, the <a id="l48"></a>two-horned Beast became his Priest, conescrated him  in the east, by consecration created all his power <a id="l49"></a> as a God, &amp; caused the eastern nations to erect  an image to him &amp; to <a id="l50"></a>worship him &amp; his image &amp; wonder after him.</em></p>

<p id="par5">Vpon the ceasing of the line of Hunnimund the son of Hermaneric, the Ostrogoths li<a id="l51"></a>ved without kings of their own nation about 40 years together, most of which <a id="l52"></a>timethey spent in Pannonia.  ‡<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 2r &gt; </span> ‡ For they came over the Danube (according to Procopius<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>)<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> about <a id="l53"></a>the same time that the Vandals &amp; Alans passed the Rhene &amp; the Visigoths invaded <a id="l54"></a>italy that is, about the year 407 or 408.  And when Attila began to make war upon the Romans, which was in the year <a id="l55"></a>444, he made Valamir with his brothers Theudemir &amp; Videmir the grandsons of Winithar, Captains or kings of <a id="l56"></a>these Ostrogoths.
