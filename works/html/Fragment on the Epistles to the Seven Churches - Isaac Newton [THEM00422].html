<p id="par1">For confirming what has been said, it may not be amiss to give a short <a id="l1"></a>explication of the seven Epistles. </p>
<p id="par2">Vpon the opening of the fift seale, the affairs of the Church begin to be considered <a id="l2"></a>as was said above, &amp; the Church is represented by a Woman appearing in <a id="l3"></a>temple of heaven &amp; pained in travail &amp; bringing forth a Manchild before her flight from <a id="l4"></a>the Temple into the spiritually barren wilderness: &amp; in this state she is <a id="l5"></a>admonished by seven Epistles sent to the seven Angels of the  Churches which <a id="l6"></a> under the type of dressing the seven lamps   which illuminate the whole Temple ,  that <a id="l7"></a>they may illuminate it the better</p>
<p id="par3">In The first Epistle is to the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, Christ <a id="l8"></a>saith, <em class="underline">I have something against thee because thou hast left thy first love <a id="l9"></a>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen &amp; the first works or else <a id="l10"></a>I will come unto thee quickly &amp;  will remove thy Candlestick  <a id="l11"></a>out of his place  except thou repent. But this thou hast that thou <a id="l12"></a>hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate. </em> And this reproof <a id="l13"></a>answers perfectly well to the state of the Church in the first twenty years <a id="l14"></a>of the reign of Dioclesian &amp; Maximianus, thus described by Eusebius. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p id="par4">When Eusebius had brought down his Ecclesiastical history to the <a id="l15"></a>Reign of Dioclesian &amp; the Episcopacy of Caius &amp; Marcelline Bishops of Rome &amp; <a id="l16"></a>Cyrill bishop of Antioch &amp; Dioclesians Persecution was at hand , he thus describes the state of the Church. Qualem <a id="l17"></a>quantam gloriam simul ac libertatem doctrina – – – – in religionem nostram <a id="l18"></a>affecti erant benevolentiam.  And a little after. Iam vero quis innumera <a id="l19"></a>bilem hominum quotidie ad fidem Christi confugentium trubam, quis numerum <a id="l20"></a>– – – – – – – – – quasi tyrannidem quandam contentissima sibi vindicantes; <a id="l21"></a>tunc demum juxta dictum Hieremiæ obscuravit dominus in ira sua filiam <a id="l22"></a>Sion &amp; dejecit de cœlo gloriam Israel.  And to this state of the Church agrees <a id="l23"></a>the first of the seven Epistles to the Angels of the seven Churches of Asia, that to the <a id="l24"></a> . <em class="underline">I have something against thee , </em> saith Christ to the Angel of the <a id="l25"></a>Church of Ephesus, <em class="underline">because thou hast left thy first love. Remember there<a id="l26"></a>fore from whence thou art fallen</em> – – – – – – <em class="underline">which I also hate. </em> By the doctrine <a id="l27"></a>of the Nicolaitans I understand spiritual fornication coloured over with a pretence <a id="l28"></a>of Christianity. </p>
<p id="par5">The persecution of Dioclesian began in the year of Christ 302 &amp; lasted  <a id="l29"></a>ten years in the eastern Empire &amp; two years in the western. And to this  <a id="l30"></a>state of the Church the second Epistle, that to the Church  in Smyrna <a id="l31"></a>agrees. <em class="underline">I know, </em> saith Christ, <em class="underline">thy works &amp; tribulation &amp; poverty, ( but thou art <a id="l32"></a>rich, ) &amp; I know the blasphemy of them  ( the Nicolaitans )  who say they are Iews &amp; are not <a id="l33"></a>but are the synagogue of Satan. Fear none of those things which thou shalt <a id="l34"></a>suffer. Behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried &amp; ye shall have <a id="l35"></a>tribulation ten days. Be thou faithfull unto death &amp; I will give the<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> a crown <a id="l36"></a>of life. </em> The tribulation of ten days can agree to no other persecution then <a id="l37"></a>that of Dioclesian, it being the only persecution which lasted ten years. By the <a id="l38"></a>Blasphemy of them that say they are Iews &amp; are not  but are of the <a id="l39"></a>synagogue of Satan, I understand the Idolatry of the Nicolaitans who called <a id="l40"></a>themselves Christians but were not Christians  but of the Church of Idola<a id="l41"></a>ters. </p>
<p id="par6"> These  Nicolaitans are complained of also in the third Epistle <a id="l42"></a>as men that held the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balac to cast a stum<a id="l43"></a>bling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to Idols &amp; <a id="l44"></a>to commit spiritual fornication. For Balaam taught the Moabites &amp; Midianites to <a id="l45"></a>tempt Israel by their Weomen &amp; invite them to the sacrifices of their Gods. Num. <a id="l46"></a>25 &amp; 31. They are complained of also in the fourth Epistle under the <a id="l47"></a>the Woman who now began name of the Woman Iezebel, that is, the Church of the Nicolaitans, called <a id="l48"></a>the synagogue of Satan in the second &amp; sixt Epistles :  she is Babylon &amp; the Woman which now began <a id="l49"></a>to fly into the wilderness. </p>
<p id="par7">And in the sixt Epistle, that to the Church of Philadelphia Christ <a id="l50"></a>saith, <em class="underline">Because thou hast kept the word of my patience  I also will keep thee <a id="l51"></a>from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the  world to try them <a id="l52"></a>that  dwell upon the earth.  Him that overcometh will I make <a id="l53"></a>a pillar in the Temple of my God, &amp; he shall go no more out,  &amp; I will write upon him the name of my God &amp;c</em> <a id="l54"></a>that is; Because in the reign of  The Emperor Iulian the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span> Apostate thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the <a id="l55"></a>hour of temptation which, by the womans flying into the wilderness &amp; the Dragons making <a id="l56"></a>war with the remnant of her seed,  &amp; the killing of all that will not worship <a id="l57"></a>the Image of the Beast, shall come upon all the world to  try them that dwell on the earth, &amp; to distinguish them by sealing the <a id="l59"></a>one with the name of God in their forehead &amp; marking other with the mark of the <a id="l60"></a>Beast; &amp; at that time I will make him that overcometh, a pillar in the second Temple <a id="l61"></a>of my God, &amp; he shall go no more out of it . And at the same time I will write upon him <a id="l62"></a>the name of my God in his forehead. So then the Christians of the Church of <a id="l63"></a>Philadelphia, as many of them as overcome are sealed with the seal of God &amp; <a id="l64"></a>placed in the second Temple &amp; go no more out. And the same is to be understood <a id="l65"></a>of the Church of Smyrna. These are therefore the two Pillars &amp; the two <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Candlesticks<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Candlesticks<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l66"></a>&amp; the two Witnesses in the second Temple. And the witnesse<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> are looked upon in <a id="l67"></a>this Prophesy as the posterity of those two Churches, the other five being faulty. </p>
<p id="par8">The reign of Constantine the great from the time of his  <a id="l68"></a>conquering Licinius, was monarchical over the whole Roman Empire. <a id="l69"></a>Then the Empire became divided between the sons of Constantine reigning <a id="l70"></a>at Rome &amp; Constantinople :  And then it was united under Constantius by his <a id="l71"></a>victory over Magnentius. And to the affairs of the Church in these three <a id="l72"></a>successive periods of time, the Epistles to the Angels of the Churches  in Pergamus <a id="l73"></a>Thyatira, &amp; Sardis seem to relate. After the reign of Iulian &amp; his succes<a id="l74"></a>sor Iovian who reigned but five months, the Empire became divided again <a id="l75"></a>between Valentinian &amp; Valens. And then the Church in the Epistle to the <a id="l76"></a>Angel of the Church in Laodicea is reprehended as luke-warm, &amp; threat<a id="l77"></a>ned to be spewed out of Christs mouth. She said that she was rich and <a id="l78"></a>increased in goods &amp; had need of nothing ( in outward appearance ) &amp; knew <a id="l79"></a>not that she was ( inwardly )  wretched &amp; miserable &amp; poor &amp; blind &amp; naked <a id="l80"></a>&amp; for her luke-warmness deserved to be spewed out of Christs mouth. </p>
<p id="par9">Mister Mede hath explained the Prophesy of the first six Trumpets <a id="l81"></a>not much amiss. If he had observed that the prophesy of pouring out the <a id="l82"></a>Vialls of wrath is synchronal to that of sounding the Trumpets, his <a id="l83"></a> Explanation would have been more complete. </p>
<p id="par10">The sacrifices  on the first four days of the Feast of Tabernacles, at which <a id="l87"></a> the first four Trumpets sound, &amp; the first four Vials of wrath are poured <a id="l88"></a>out, are represented by  four winds to the four corners of the earth. The <a id="l89"></a>first was an east wind, the second a west wind, the third a south wind, <a id="l90"></a>the fourth a north wind with respect to the City of Rome. </p>
<p id="par11">The first plague fell upon the Earth &amp; signifies the invasion of <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>all the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Greek <a id="l91"></a>Empire  It commenced A.C. 396 &amp; is thus touched upon by Ierom.  by the Goths &amp; other nations  presently after the death of Theodosius. </p>
<br><br>
<p id="par12">The second plague fell  fell upon the sea or Western Empire &amp; principally upon Gaul &amp; Spain by the  inrode <a id="l92"></a>of the Visigoths, Vandals, Alans, Sueves, Ostrogoths, Burgundians  It commenced A.C. 407 &amp; in these wars Rome was sackt &amp; the <a id="l93"></a>western Empire  broken into ten kingdoms .  </p>


<span class="pagenumber" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span>
<p id="par15">The third fell upon the <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> rivers &amp; fountains of waters, that is, upon the western <a id="l97"></a>Empire now divided into many kingdoms, &amp; commenced with the invasion of Afric <a id="l98"></a>by the Vandals A.C. 428. And by this war Afric was taken from the Romans, &amp; <a id="l99"></a>Rome was sackt a second time &amp; Italy much infested by sea.  </p>
<p id="par16">The fourth fell upon the Sun Moon &amp; Stars, that is upon the Western Emperor <a id="l100"></a>&amp; the remainder of his dominions, It began A.C. 476 when Odoacer king of the <a id="l101"></a>Heruli  invaded Italy &amp; seized the dominions of Augustulus the last of the <a id="l102"></a>western Emperors  .   It was continued by the warrs which the Ostrogoths under <a id="l103"></a>Theoderic made upon  the Heruli &amp; which Bellisarius afterwards made <a id="l104"></a>upon the Ostrogoths, &amp; which the Lombards afterwards made upon  Italy when <a id="l105"></a>they invaded it. And in all these wars Italy was miserably wasted &amp; Rome <a id="l106"></a>twice taken. </p>
<p id="par17">The fift Trumpet sounded to the wars which the king of the south  ( as he is called (  by Daniel )  made in the <a id="l107"></a>time of the end in pushing at the king who had done according to his will &amp; magnified <a id="l108"></a>himself above every God, &amp; worshipped Mahuzzims. </p>
<p id="par18">And the sixt sounded to the warrs which  Daniels king of the north  made  against <a id="l109"></a>the same king who  had done according to his will, in coming against him like a <a id="l110"></a>whirlwind &amp; overflowing his kingdom &amp; in conquering also Iudæa, Egypt Libyia &amp; Ethiopia. </p>
<p id="par19">The  Prophesy of the first Trumpet  lasted 12 years, that of the second 21 years <a id="l111"></a>that of the third 48 years , that of the fourth about 158 years that of the fift about 624  years &amp; <a id="l112"></a>according to this progress that of the sixt may  last <a id="l113"></a>but still longer. But it is not for us to know the times &amp; seasons which God hath <a id="l114"></a>put in his own Breast. Daniel calls the reign of the kings  of the <a id="l115"></a>South &amp; North the time of the end, &amp; tells us that at the time of the end <a id="l116"></a>many shall run to &amp; fro &amp; knowledge shall be encreased &amp; that none of the <a id="l117"></a>wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand.

<p id="par20">At the sounding of the fift Trumpet  a star fell from heaven to the earth <a id="l135"></a> ( Manhomet by Apostacy, ) &amp; the star opened the bottomless pit ( to let out a fals religion ) &amp; <a id="l136"></a>there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smok of a furnace ( a great number of disci<a id="l137"></a>ples ) &amp; there came out of the smoke  ( a military power like ) locusts ( for <a id="l138"></a>multitude )  which were to hurt only the men which have not the seale of God in their <a id="l139"></a>forehead,  &amp; to torment them five months but not to kill them <a id="l140"></a>that is not to overthrow the Greek Empire.  And the locusts were like horses prepared to the battel &amp; had faces like men &amp; hair <a id="l141"></a>like weomen ( the Arabians wearing their hair long behind ) &amp; the sound of their wings <a id="l142"></a>was as the sound of Chariots of many horses running to the battel. And they had a <a id="l143"></a>a king over them, the Calif reigning first at Damascus &amp; then at Bagdad. And they <a id="l144"></a>had tailes like unto Scorpions ( armies of foot ) &amp; stings in their tailes. And the fift Angel <a id="l145"></a>poured  out his Vial upon the seat of the Beast &amp; his kingdom was <a id="l146"></a>full of darkness &amp; they gnawed their tongues for pain. The Saracens invaded Syria Persia Egypt, Libya <a id="l147"></a>&amp; Afric   &amp; Spain harrased  Italy &amp; France.

And  there <a id="l158"></a>Iohn wrote his Apocalyps. As the old Prophets had their several styles so  Iohn had his <a id="l159"></a>proper style.

<p id="par24">When copies of the Apocalyps were sent to the Churches, Paul wrote his Epistle <a id="l170"></a>to the dispersed Hebrews which is a Commentary upon the Apocalyps .  The first ten chapters of this Epistle are a commentary upon <a id="l173"></a>the vision of Christ appearing in the form of the High Priest in the beginning of the Apocalyps . <a id="l174"></a><sup><span class="ns">☉</span></sup><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 2v &gt; </span><span class="ns">☉</span> In the 4<sup>th</sup> chapter  the Apostle calls this High Priest <em class="underline">the Word of God more quick &amp; powerfull then <a id="l175"></a>a two edged sword</em> which plainly relates to the vision of  a white horse <a id="l176"></a> &amp; one sitting upon him whose name was called the word of God, &amp;  out of whose mouth went  forth a short two edged sword. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from higher up f 2v resumes &gt; </span> In the eleventh chapter the Apostle mentions the city which hath foundations whose <a id="l177"></a>builder &amp; maker is God &amp; which in the next chapter he calls the city of the living God, the <a id="l178"></a>heavenly Ierusalem prepared for the general assembly of them  who are written in heaven <a id="l179"></a>&amp; the spirits of just men made perfect:  all which alludes to the <a id="l180"></a>new Ierusalem with twelve foundations described in the end of the Apocalyps. And in <a id="l181"></a>the same 12<sup>th</sup> chapter he uses the phrase of <em class="underline">a cloud of witnesses</em> , a phrase not <a id="l182"></a>to be met with in any  former author except the Apocalyps where the two <a id="l183"></a>Witnesses ascend up to heaven in a cloud. </p>
<p id="par25">The two Epistles of Peter have also much relation to the Apocalyps. </p>
