<p id="par3">Thus far Irenæus concerning the Creed delivered down by univer<a id="l7"></a>sal tradition from the beginning of the Gospel, representing that it <a id="l8"></a>was not lawfull for any man to enlarge diminish or alter it: ffor <a id="l9"></a>no man is above his master &amp; by the institution of Christ &amp; his Apo<a id="l10"></a>stles it conteins that one ffaith by which &amp; baptism all Christians <a id="l11"></a>were admitted into the Church Catholick from the beginning of <a id="l12"></a>the Gospel. Polycarp was the disciple of Iohn the Apostle &amp; <a id="l13"></a> conversed with others also who had seen the Lord, &amp; Irenæus <a id="l14"></a>was the disciple of Polycarp, &amp; therefore in reciting the sense of the primi<a id="l15"></a>tive Creed &amp; telling us that it was received from the Apostles <a id="l16"></a>&amp; their disciples deserves to be credited</p>
<p id="par4">The same Irenæus in the 4<sup>th</sup> Chapter of his third book writes <a id="l17"></a>thus of the Creed. If a dispute should arise concerning any small <a id="l18"></a>question ought we not to have recourse to the most ancient Chur<a id="l19"></a>ches in which the Apostles conversed &amp; take from them that which is <a id="l20"></a>certain &amp; manifest concerning the present question? And if the <a id="l21"></a>Apostles had left us nothing in writing, ought we not to follow the <a id="l22"></a>order of tradition which they delivered to those to whom they committed <a id="l23"></a>the churches? To which ordination many barbarous nations  who beleive<a id="l24"></a> in Christ give their assent, having salvation written  without <a id="l25"></a>paper &amp; ink by the spirit in their hearts &amp; diligently keeping the <a id="l26"></a>old Tradition, beleiving in one God the maker of heaven &amp; earth <a id="l27"></a>&amp; of all things in them, by Christ Iesus the son of God, who out of <a id="l28"></a>his  most eminent love towards his work, underwent the being born <a id="l29"></a>of a Virgin, uniting man to God by himself, &amp; suffering under Pontius <a id="l30"></a>Pilate &amp; rising again &amp; being received with bightness into glory, shall <a id="l31"></a>come the saviour of those that are  saved &amp; the judge of those which <a id="l32"></a>are judged, sending into eternal fire the corrupters of the truth &amp; the <a id="l33"></a>contemners of his father &amp; of his coming. This faith they who have <a id="l34"></a>beleived without lett<span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span>s to our language are barbarians, but as to <a id="l35"></a>opinion &amp;  practise &amp; conversation, by reason of the faith are <a id="l36"></a>most wise &amp; please God conversing in all justice &amp; chastity &amp; wisdome. <a id="l37"></a>To whom if any man speaking to them in their own language should tell the inventions of hereticks,  they would <a id="l38"></a>presently shutting their ears, fly far away not enduring to hear the <a id="l39"></a>blasphemous discourse. Thus by means of that ancient Tradition of the Apostles <a id="l40"></a>they do not so much as admit into their thoughts the monstrous speeches <a id="l41"></a>of the heretics.  Thus far Irenæus. Now By this discourse of Irenæus, you <a id="l42"></a>may  perceive that  many nations who understood not the language <a id="l43"></a>of the Greeks &amp; Latines nor had the scriptures translated into their language <a id="l44"></a> <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>received<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the faith &amp; delivered it down to posterity by oral tradition <a id="l45"></a><span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> which faith was the doctrine of the Creed <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> by means of the faith <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p100v"> &lt;100v&gt; </span> &amp; by means of this faith &amp; baptism they became members of the Church Catholick. <a id="l46"></a>Without having any written scriptures,  And as the faith by which they became members of the <a id="l51"></a> Church &amp; heirs of salvation lay in a few things easy to be learned &amp; <a id="l52"></a>remembred without writing so did the practise   They commemorated the creation of the world by keeping the sabbath, the resurrection of Christ by keeping the morning of the Lords day before sunrise &amp; the passion by breaking of bread &amp; were  were to love God with all their heart &amp; soul &amp; their neighbours as themselves; &amp; live quietly under governments.   &amp; avoid [sorcery which consists in attributing supernatural vertue to ceremonies dead things &amp; forms of words] superstition.   And all this  <a id="l64"></a> with such a form of government as might be convenient  for exercising this religion  releiving the poor   admitting prose<a id="l66"></a>lites &amp;  admonishing <a id="l69"></a>evil men or expelling them from communion comprehends the whole  faith &amp; practise of the christian religion, &amp; might be easily remembred &amp; propagated down to posterity by oral tradition  amongst the barbarous nations mentioned by Irenæus without having the scriptures or any thing else in writing..  <a id="l72"></a> There are indeed many truths of a higher nature which <a id="l76"></a>Paul compares to strong meats for men of ripe age, but these are not <a id="l77"></a> necessary to communion. Men may learn as much of them as they <a id="l78"></a>can in their private capacity, &amp; teach their neighbours in a peaceable manner, but ought not to contend or disturb the peace of the Church <a id="l79"></a>with disputes about them. The strong in the faith must bear with the weak <a id="l80"></a>&amp; the weak must not  judge the strong.</p>
<p id="par5">Conformable to these Creeds of Irenæus is a Creed recited by <a id="l81"></a>Tertullian in his book de virginibus velandis in these words Regula quidem fidei una  omnino est sola immobilis et irreformabilis <a id="l82"></a>credendi scilicet in unicum Deum mundi conditorem, &amp; filium ejus <a id="l83"></a>Iesum Christum natum ex virgine Maria, curifixum sub Pontio <a id="l84"></a>Pilato, tertia die resuscitatum a mortuis, receptum in cælis, seden<a id="l85"></a>tem nunc ad dexteram Patris, venturum judicare vivos &amp; mortuos <a id="l86"></a>per carnis etiam resurrectionem  And in his book de Præscriptione Hæreticorum he <a id="l89"></a>paraphrases the Creed in this manner. Credimus unum omnino Deum <a id="l90"></a>esse, nec alium præter mundi conditorem qui universa [de nihilo] produxe<a id="l91"></a>rit per Verbum suum primo omnium  demissum: Id Verbum <a id="l92"></a>filium ejus <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> in nomine Dei varie visum a Patriarchis Prophe<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p101r"> &lt;101r&gt; </span>tis semper auditum, postremo delatum ex spiritu Patris Dei et virtute in <a id="l93"></a>Virginem Mariam, carnem factum in utero ejus, &amp; ex ea natum egisse <a id="l94"></a>Iesum Christum, exinde prædicasse novam legem &amp; novam promissionem <a id="l95"></a>regni cælorum, virtutes fecisse, fixum cruci, tertia die resurrexisse <a id="l96"></a>in cælos ereptum sedisse ad dextram Patris, misisse vicariam vim spiritus <a id="l97"></a>sancti qui credentes agat, venturum cum claritate ad sumendos sanctos <a id="l98"></a>in vitæ æternæ &amp; promissorum cœlestium fructum &amp; ad profanos adjudi<a id="l99"></a>candos igni perpetuo, facta utriusque partis resuscitatione cum carnis restitutione. Hæc regula a Christo instituta nullas <a id="l100"></a>habet  apud nos quæstiones nisi quas hæreses inferunt &amp; <a id="l101"></a>quæ hæreticos faciunt.  And again, in his book <a id="l102"></a>adversus Praxeam, he  thus paraphrases the Creed. Vnicum quidem Deum credimus; sub hac tamen dispensatione <a id="l104"></a>quam œconomiam dicimus ut unici Dei sit et ffilius sermo ipsius qui <a id="l105"></a>ex ipso processerit per quem omnia facta sunt &amp; sine quo factum est <a id="l106"></a>nihil. Hunc missum a patre in Virginem &amp; ex ea natum hominem &amp; <a id="l107"></a>Deum, filium hominis et filium Dei, &amp; cognominatum Iesum Christum: <a id="l108"></a>hunc passum, hunc mortuum &amp; sepultum secundum scripturas <a id="l109"></a>&amp; resuscitatum a patre &amp; in cœlos resumptum sedere ad dexteram <a id="l110"></a> Patris, venturum judicare vivos &amp; mortuos, <a id="l111"></a>qui exinde miserit, secundum promissionem suam, a Patre spiritum sanctum <a id="l112"></a>sanctum Paracletum, sanctificatorem fidei eorum qui credunt in Patrem <a id="l113"></a>&amp; filium et spiritum sanctum. Hanc Regulam ab initio Evangelij decur<a id="l114"></a>risse, etiam ante priores quosque Hæreticos, nedum ante Praxeam hester<a id="l115"></a>num, probabit tam ipsa posteritas omnium hæreticorum, quam ipsa <a id="l116"></a>novellitas Praxeæ hesterni.</p>
<p id="par6">In the fourth Century they began to insert new Articles into the <a id="l117"></a>Creed, &amp; one of the first new articles was that of the  Catholick Church.  Alexander <a id="l118"></a>bishop of Alexandria in  making a prolix declaration of his faith inserts it in these words We con<a id="l121"></a>fess also one Holy Ghost – – &amp; one only Ca<a id="l122"></a>tholick  Apostolick Church which is ever inexpugnable tho the whole <a id="l123"></a>world attack it – – –  Apud Theodoritum Eccl. Hist. l. 1.  c. 4.</p>
<p id="par7">And hence the Article the Catholick Church crept into the Creed of the Church of <a id="l129"></a>Ierusalem which is thus recited by Cyrill bishop of that City. I beleive in one God <a id="l130"></a>the father Almighty maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp; of all things  visible <a id="l131"></a>&amp; invisible. And in the Lord Iesus Christ the only begotten son of God <a id="l132"></a>begotten  of his father before all worlds, the true God by <a id="l133"></a>whom all things were made, who was incarnate &amp; made man crucified &amp; <a id="l134"></a>buried rose again from the dead the third day &amp; ascended into heaven <a id="l135"></a>&amp; sitteth at the right hand of the father &amp; shall come to judge the <a id="l136"></a>quick &amp; the dead, of whose kingdom there shall be no end. And in the <a id="l137"></a>Holy Ghost the Comforter who spake by the Prophets, &amp; in one Holy <a id="l138"></a>Catholick Church &amp; in the resurrection of the flesh &amp; <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>in<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> life everlasting.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p101v"> &lt;101v&gt; </span>
<p id="par8">The same Article crept also into the Creed of the City Hippo in Afric<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> <a id="l139"></a>which is thus recited by Austin bishop thereof I beleive in God the father Almighty <a id="l140"></a>maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp; in Iesus Christ his  only son  who was <a id="l141"></a>  born by the Holy Ghost  of the Virgin Mary  was crucified under Pontius Pilate <a id="l142"></a> &amp; buried rose again the third day from the dead, ascended into heaven &amp; sitteth at the right hand of God the father from whence he <a id="l143"></a>shall come to judge the quick &amp; the dead I beleive in the Holy Ghost, the Holy <a id="l144"></a>Catholick Church, the forgiveness of sins &amp; the resurrection of the flesh.</p>

<p id="par10">The next article that was inserted was the consubsantiality of the father  &amp; son. Eusebius of Cæsarea in the Council of Nice produced the Creed <a id="l146"></a> which  he had received from his ancestors &amp; into which he <a id="l147"></a>had been baptized, &amp; it  is this.  We beleive in one God the father <a id="l148"></a> almighty, creator of all things visible &amp; invisible: &amp; in one <a id="l149"></a>Lord Iesus Christ, the Word of God, God of God, light of light Life of <a id="l150"></a>life, the only begotten son, the first begotten of every creature, begotten <a id="l151"></a>of his father before all worlds, by whom all things were made, who for <a id="l152"></a>our salvation was incarnate &amp; conversed among men, who suffered &amp; <a id="l153"></a>rose again the third day, &amp; ascended to his father, &amp; shall come again <a id="l154"></a>with glory to judge the quick &amp; the dead. We beleive also in one Holy <a id="l155"></a>Ghost. This Creed was approved by the Emperor Constantine &amp; all the Council, but the Emperor <a id="l156"></a>proposed &amp; pressed to have the  consubstantiality of the Son inserted &amp; so the <a id="l157"></a>Council composed this Creed. We beleive in one God, the father Almi<a id="l158"></a>ghty, the maker of all things visible &amp; invisible: &amp; in one Lord Iesus <a id="l159"></a>Christ the son of God, the only begotten of his father, that is, of the sub<a id="l160"></a>stance of his father: God of God, light of light, very God of very God, <a id="l161"></a>begotten not made; consubstantial to the father, by whom all things <a id="l162"></a>were made which are in heaven &amp; in earth; Who for us men &amp; for our <a id="l163"></a>salvation descended, &amp; was incarnate, made man, suffered, &amp; rose again <a id="l164"></a>the third day; ascended to heaven, &amp; shall come to judge the quick <a id="l165"></a>&amp; the dead: &amp; in the Holy Ghost. In this Creed by the word con<a id="l166"></a>substantial they understand that the father &amp; son are two substan<a id="l167"></a>ces of the same nature. For the  words Ομοούσιος &amp;  consubstantial,  were always by the Greeks &amp; Latines <a id="l169"></a>taken for two substances of the same essence nature or species. When applied to <a id="l170"></a>corporeal things they signify two substances taken out of the same <a id="l171"></a>mass, when to incorporeal ones they signify two substances  as like <a id="l172"></a>one another as if they had been taken out of the same mass. And <a id="l173"></a>therefore  Epiphanius tells us that they do not say that the <a id="l174"></a>son is ταυτοούσιος or μονοουσιος  to the father but ὁμοούσιος. And the Council <a id="l175"></a>of  <span class="hspac-n" title="14 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> said that the son was consubstantial to the father <a id="l176"></a>as touching his Godhead &amp; consubstantial to us as touching his man<a id="l177"></a>hood. And in this Creed the  son is said to be begotten of his father, that is <a id="l178"></a>of the substance of his father:  Which would be improper if the <a id="l179"></a>substance of the father was the substance of the son. And that the word ομοουσιος might be limited to signify only the likeness of two substances without the division of one substance into two, several of the Nicene fathers in subscribing explained the word ομοούσιος by <span class="ns">☉</span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the left margin of f 101v &gt; </span> <span class="ns">☉</span> adding τουτέστιν ὁμοιούσιος.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 101v resumes &gt; </span> for so the father would be  the substance of the son &amp;  the son would be begotten of his own substance. As the father is by this <a id="l180"></a>Creed declared to be the substance of the father so the son is the substance <a id="l181"></a>of the Son &amp;  therefore according to this Creed the substance of <a id="l182"></a>the son was begotten of the substance of the father. And it is further obser<a id="l183"></a>vable that the Greeks called  the father &amp; son two Hypostases, &amp; Hypostases <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p102r"> &lt;102r&gt; </span> signify substances &amp; cannot signify persons in any other sense then as <a id="l184"></a>persons are taken for  substantial persons or personal substances. <a id="l185"></a> In this sense the Latines <a id="l187"></a>took persons till the dark ages came on &amp; then the Latines ceasing to  to understand any thing of  the Greek language,  began <a id="l189"></a>to take   Hypostases or personal substances for something else then substances.</p>
<p id="par11"> About 56 years after the Council of Nice had made this Creed,  the worship <a id="l190"></a>of the Holy Ghost was inserted into  it by the Council of Constan<a id="l191"></a>tinople in these words. I beleive in one God, the father Almighty, maker <a id="l192"></a>of heaven &amp; earth &amp; of all things visible &amp; invisible. And in one <a id="l193"></a>Lord Iesus Christ the only begotten son of God, begotten of the father <a id="l194"></a>before all worlds, that is, of the substance of the father, God of God, light of light, very God of very <a id="l195"></a>God, begotten not made, Consubstantial to the father, by whom <a id="l196"></a>all things were made, who for us men &amp; our salvation  descended from heaven &amp; was incarnate by the holy Ghost <a id="l198"></a>of the Virgin &amp; was made man &amp; crucified for us under Pontius <a id="l199"></a>Pilate &amp; buried &amp; rose again the third day according to the Scriptures &amp; ascended into heaven &amp; <a id="l200"></a>sitteth on the right hand of the father &amp; shall come again in glory <a id="l201"></a>to judge the quick &amp; the dead, of whose kingdom there shall be no end. <a id="l202"></a>And in the Holy Ghost the Lord &amp; giver of life, who proceedeth from <a id="l203"></a>the father, who with the father &amp; son together is worshipped &amp; <a id="l204"></a>glorified, who spake by the Prophets: And in one catholick &amp; Apostolic <a id="l205"></a>Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins &amp; <a id="l206"></a>look for the resurrection of the dead &amp; the life of the world to come. <a id="l207"></a>Henceforward the father son &amp; holy ghost were accounted three substances <a id="l208"></a>of one &amp; the same usia, essence, nature or species,  as Peter Iames &amp; Iohn are three individual persons of one species. For that this was the received opinion  in the fourth &amp; fift centuries D<sup>r</sup> Cudworth as   <a id="l209"></a>&amp; Curcellæus have proved at large beyond any possibility of  <a id="l210"></a> doubting.</p>
<p id="par12">Another new Article inserted into the Creed was the descent of <a id="l211"></a>Christ into the infernal regions.  The Council of Ariminum first inserted it in their Creed which runs thus – – – It is also found in the following Creed of  Aquileia <a id="l212"></a>into which Ruffin saith that he was baptized. Credo in Deum Patrem omnipoten<a id="l213"></a>tem et in Christum Iesum unicum filium ejus Dominum nostrum: qui <a id="l214"></a>natus est de spiritu sancto ex Maria Virgine, crucifixus sub Pontio <a id="l215"></a>Pilato &amp; sepultus, descendit in inferna, tertia die resurrexit a mortuis, <a id="l216"></a>ascendit in cœlos, sedet ad dexteram Patris: inde venturus est judicare <a id="l217"></a>vivos et mortuos: et in spiritum sanctum, sanctam ecclesiam Catholi<a id="l218"></a>cam, remissionem peccatorum, hujus carnis resurrectionem.  This article is also found in the  Creed  usually called the Apostles Creed, the word Hades or Hell being there put for the infernal regions.</p>
<p id="par13">Another new Article was the Communion of Saints as in the <a id="l219"></a>Creed of the Roman Church commonly called the Apostles Creed which runs <a id="l220"></a>thus. I beleive in God the father Almighty maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp; <a id="l221"></a>in Iesus Christ his only son our Lord who was conceived by the Holy Ghost <a id="l222"></a>born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate was crucified dead <a id="l223"></a>&amp; buried, descended into Hell, the third day rose again from the dead, ascended <a id="l224"></a>into heaven, sitteth on the right hand of God the father, shall come again to judge <a id="l225"></a>the quick &amp; the dead. I beleive in the Holy Ghost, the holy Catholick Church <a id="l226"></a>the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p102v"> &lt;102v&gt; </span> &amp;  life everlasting. The descent into the infernal regions called <a id="l227"></a>Hell was added for asserting that Christ had a humane soul, &amp; the <a id="l228"></a>communion of saints for asserting that the saints departed this life <a id="l229"></a>held communion with the Church  militant,  knew our <a id="l230"></a>affairs heard our prayers &amp; were able to do us good or hurt.  ffor so Austin Bishop of Hippo <a id="l232"></a>explains it in his commentary on this Creed  Serm 181 de Temp.</p>
<p id="par14">Now if all these Creeds be compared with one another &amp; <a id="l233"></a> the Articles inserted in the fourth Century be omitted, it will <a id="l234"></a> appear that the tradition of faith  which was handed <a id="l235"></a>down from the Apostles &amp;  by which &amp; baptism all nations during the first three <a id="l236"></a>hundred years were  admitted into the Church consisted in <a id="l237"></a>these articles. I beleive in one God, the father Almighty, the maker <a id="l238"></a>of heaven &amp; earth &amp; of all things therein visible &amp; invisible: And in <a id="l239"></a>one Lord Iesus Christ  his only Son, our Lord, who was in<a id="l240"></a>carnate by the Holy Ghost, crucified under Pontius Pilate died &amp; buried, <a id="l241"></a>the third day he arose from the dead, ascended into heaven &amp; sitteth <a id="l242"></a>at the right hand of God the father; from whence he shall come <a id="l243"></a>to judge the quick &amp;  also the dead raised again to life in the body : And I <a id="l245"></a>believe in the Holy Ghost who  spake by the Prophets <a id="l246"></a>  This Creed I say seems to me to contein  all the funda<a id="l247"></a>mental points of faith  which were required to Baptism &amp; communion with the <a id="l248"></a>Church   during the three first Centuries of the Christian religion. For the Creation of the world by Iesus Christ &amp; his appearing to the Patriarchs was wanting in all the western Creeds &amp; some  of the eastern &amp; therefore might be learnt as well  after baptism as before being one of those mysterious truths which the Apostle Paul compares to strong meats. And what was not necessary to baptism  in the first ages of the Christian religion could not be made necessary afterwards by any power on earth. None of the strong meats were to be  forced upon  babes instead of milk. And yet the Bishops of <a id="l257"></a>the fourth Century took the liberty of inserting many new articles <a id="l258"></a>into the Creed as above &amp; thereby brake the Church into parties  &amp; raised <a id="l259"></a> great disputes animosities &amp; commotions in the whole Empire,  which lasted with the greatest violence all that <a id="l260"></a>century &amp; part of the next.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p103r"> &lt;103r&gt; </span>
<p id="par15">I beleive in one God the father Almighty, maker of heaven &amp; earth <a id="l261"></a>&amp; in Iesus Christ his only son <em class="underline">who was born by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin <a id="l262"></a>Mary</em>. (M.T. &amp; P.C)</p>  <span class="pagenumber" id="p103v"> &lt;103v&gt; </span>
<p id="par16">How this unwritten tradition  this form of doctrine was delivered to the Churches is best learnt by reciting the <a id="l263"></a>Creeds of the first ages of Christianity &amp; comparing them together to see <a id="l264"></a>how far they agree. For tho the several Creeds propagated down to <a id="l265"></a>posterity by memory in several Churches may  happen to differ in some modes <a id="l266"></a>of expression yet  so far as  they agree in the substance of the faith &amp;  sense <a id="l267"></a>of the words without any dispute arising between the Churches about them they may be recconed one &amp; the same  <a id="l268"></a>tradition. And this tradition is thus recorded by Irenæus.</p>
<p id="par17" class="i0">— according to his humanity. And the faith of this Council was confirmed <a id="l269"></a>by the 5<sup>t</sup> 6<sup>t</sup> 7<sup>th</sup> &amp; 8<sup>th</sup> General Councils &amp; some other councils of less note &amp; much celebrated by <a id="l270"></a>several  Popes as <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup>Leo M, <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup>Gelasius, <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup>Gregory M. <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup>Martin I. [And the <a id="l271"></a>Article of  their faith  here recited was professed by Iohn Bishop of Anti<a id="l272"></a>och Cyrill bishop of Alexandria &amp; Flavian bishop of Constantinople before the <a id="l273"></a>Council &amp; preached by Leo bishop of Rome]</p>
<p id="par18">And its further observable that Iohn Bishop of Antioch with  other <a id="l274"></a>oriental Bishops  presently after the third General Council composed <a id="l275"></a> this profession of faith.  <em class="underline">We confess that our Lord Iesus <a id="l276"></a>Christ the only begotten Son of God is perfect God &amp; perfect Man of a reasona<a id="l277"></a>ble soul &amp; a body</em> [consisting] <em class="underline"> begotten of the father before all worlds according to his <a id="l278"></a>Deity, &amp; in the last times for us &amp; our salvation born of the Virgin Mary accord<a id="l279"></a>ing to his humanity: ομοούσιος to the father according to his Deity &amp; ὁμοούσιος <a id="l280"></a>to us  according to his humanity. ffor there is an union made of the two <a id="l281"></a>natures, by reason whereof we confess one Christ one Son one Lord. In this <a id="l282"></a>sense of an unconfused unity we confess  that the holy Virgin is</em> θεοτόκος. And <a id="l283"></a>This profession of faith was approved by Cyrill bishop of Alexandria, <a id="l284"></a>&amp; by Flavian bishop of Constantinople  &amp; afterwards established by the <a id="l285"></a>Council of Chalcedon  with an anathema against all  who beleived otherwise. And <a id="l287"></a>this Council consisted of 630 bishops collected out of all  the eastern Empire <a id="l288"></a>&amp; Pope Leo the great by his delegates presided in it &amp; subscribed it &amp;  in point of faith it was confirmed by the 5<sup>t</sup> 6<sup>t</sup> 7th &amp; 8<sup>th</sup> General <a id="l289"></a>Councils &amp; some other Councils of less note &amp;  was zealously asserted &amp; much celebrated by  the several  Bishops of <a id="l290"></a> Rome, &amp; generally received in the Greek &amp; Latin Churches.  Leo the great  by his Legates presided in it &amp;  <a id="l291"></a>subscribed it  &amp; afterwards preached that the son  as God was consubstantial to the ffather &amp; as man was consubstantiall to his mother. [Serm 10 in Solennitate Nativita<a id="l295"></a>tis Domini.] &amp;  he &amp; the Popes Gelasius, Gregory the Great &amp; Martin the 1<sup>st</sup> <a id="l296"></a>were zealus for the faith of this Council.] And by consequence it was the <a id="l297"></a>general opinion of the 5<sup>t</sup> 6<sup>t</sup> 7<sup>th</sup> &amp; 8<sup>th</sup> &amp; 9<sup>th</sup> centuries, especially in <a id="l298"></a>the Greek Churches, that the  son was ὁμοούσιος  <a id="l299"></a>to the father according to his Godhead &amp; ὁμοούσιος to us according to his <a id="l300"></a>manhood.  not  <a id="l302"></a> ταυτοούσιος of the same individual substance but ομοούσιος of the same  species of sub<a id="l303"></a>stance. And in the same sence the vulgar Creed  called the Creed  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 103r &gt; </span> of Athanasius saith that the son is  God of the substance of the <a id="l304"></a>father &amp; man of the substance of his mother, that is, substance of <a id="l305"></a>substance. If the father had not a substance proper to himself the son <a id="l306"></a>could not be called God of the substance of the father. One of the prin<a id="l307"></a>cipal arguments  used  in the 4<sup>th</sup> Century to prove the son to be <a id="l308"></a>consubstantial to the father was that he would  otherwise be called the Son abusively &amp; not be the true <a id="l309"></a>natural son of the father as one man is the true son of another, &amp; <a id="l310"></a>this argument would have been of no force if the son were not substance of <a id="l311"></a>substance.  When therefore the Greeks  began to call the father son &amp; <a id="l312"></a>Holy Ghost three Hypostases &amp; one usia  &amp; by the Latines were called Arians for this languag both Greeks &amp; Latines by their by three  Hypostases  understood three substances.  <a id="l314"></a> ffor the  Latines  in the Council of Serdica <a id="l317"></a>took Hypostasis in the same sense with  ὀυσία in Greek &amp; substantia in Latine. <a id="l318"></a> &amp; so did those Greeks who <a id="l319"></a>said there was but one Hypostasis in the Deity. And therefore those who said there <a id="l320"></a>were three Hypostases &amp; one  Vsia meant  three substances <a id="l321"></a>in number &amp; one in essence or nature. [And  Athanasius upon examining <a id="l322"></a>some of the Latines declared that they meant the same thing by three <a id="l323"></a>Persons &amp; one substance] And the Latines who said there were three <a id="l324"></a>Persons &amp; one substance after Athanasius had reconciled them with the Greeks meant three  substantial persons or perso<a id="l325"></a>nal substances in number &amp; one in nature, untill the dark ages came on <a id="l326"></a>&amp; the Schoolmen taught the Latines to take one substance for one number./ Nor would the Greeks <a id="l327"></a>have called the father &amp; son two hypostases nor have concluded the consubstantiality <a id="l328"></a>of the son to the father from the consubstantiality of a man to his father  <a id="l329"></a>as they generally did. And lastly the writers of the  fourth &amp; fift  &amp; some following centuries  <a id="l330"></a>generally interpreted the Nicene  consubstantiality of two substances in <a id="l331"></a>number &amp; one in nature, as has been  sufficiently shewed by Curcellæus &amp; D<sup>r</sup> <a id="l332"></a>Cudworth out of the writings of Athanasius, Hilary, Epiphanius, Basil, <a id="l333"></a>Greg. Naz. Greg. Nyss. Ambrose, Chrysostom, Ierome,  Iustin, Theodoret <a id="l334"></a>Maximus, Cyrill of Alex. Marius Victorinus, Anastasius Theopolitanus, <a id="l335"></a>Iohn Damascene, &amp; Euthymius Zygabenus.</p>
<p id="par19" class="i0">The Greeks by   &amp; <a id="l336"></a>by  arguing the consubstantiality of the Son to  the ffather from the likeness of a man to his father <a id="l337"></a>understood them to be two like substances, &amp;  signified this by calling them two <a id="l338"></a>hypostases. And the Latines also in those days tooke Hypostases for substances as is manifest by the general Epistle of the Council of Serdica. And if the latines now take hypostasis for something else then <a id="l339"></a>substance, it is because  they follow the Divinity of the Schoolmen who understood not Greek.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 103v resumes &gt; </span>

<p id="par23">As the Iews tolerated the Saducees who denyed the resurrection &amp; all the prophets <a id="l354"></a>except Moses, so the first Christians  tolerated some erroneous opi<a id="l355"></a>nions which their successors declared to be heresy.  The converted Iews which were for imposing <a id="l356"></a>the law  upon the Gentiles were  in communion with the Church at Ierusalem .

They went out from us saith Iohn be<a id="l359"></a>cause they were not of us for if they had been of us they would have <a id="l360"></a>continued with us. And Iude: These are they that separate themselves. ②  Those who held that Christ was a mere man actuated by a spirit from <a id="l362"></a>above continued in communion till after the days of Iustin Martyr. For Iustin <a id="l363"></a>gives us this account of them.

For there Epiphanius places the beginning of <a id="l367"></a>the heresy of the  Alogi. ③ But  about the end of the  second century  <a id="l368"></a>Theodotus the Tanner was excommunicated  in the west &amp; Arte<a id="l369"></a>mas soon after in the East  for this opinion. And then <a id="l370"></a>their disciples  pretended that their opinion was taught by the Apostles &amp; <a id="l371"></a>ancient Christians &amp; the truth of the doctrine conserved till the days of Po<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>pe<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l372"></a>Victor, but from the days of his successor Zepherine was adulterated.  Iustin lets us know that they were but few in his days &amp; by consequence that <a id="l374"></a>their opinion was only tolerated in the west till the days of Pope Victor &amp; in the East till the <a id="l375"></a>days of Pope Zepherine. After those days this opinion was constantly accounted <a id="l376"></a>heretical being condemned in Noetus,   Sabellius, Paul, Eustathius, Marcellus &amp; <a id="l377"></a>Photinus.  All these <a id="l381"></a>held that the Logus or spirit by which  Iesus was actuated was not a person. But <a id="l382"></a>they that said the Logus was a person, were reputed to make Iesus both God &amp; <a id="l383"></a>man &amp;  allowed  to continue in communion:  without inquiring particularly into their opinion about the  nature of the Logus &amp; his incarnation.

And a little after: Quanquam cum <a id="l406"></a><span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> id est carnem. By this it is manifest that the  Montanists <a id="l407"></a><span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> made such an union between the Logus &amp; <a id="l408"></a><span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> as the  ancienter hereticks made between <a id="l409"></a><span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span>e &amp; Iesus &amp; therefore were Nicolaitans.

The Logus according to this philosopher dwellt in Iesus as the holy <a id="l412"></a>spirit doth in good men, without  alteration or mixture of substances <a id="l413"></a>And when they called them one person, they meant  one in outward form &amp; <a id="l414"></a> appearance, but not in substance  life  will &amp; power  one in name &amp; two in nature.</p>
<p id="par28" class="i0">In words they professed an union,  as the ancienter hereticks did  &amp; they made this union more lasting but not more intimate &amp; real or of another kind.  When they <a id="l418"></a>called them one person they meant  in outward form &amp; appearance  but not in substance, life, will, understanding,  power, or anything else which was real: one in name &amp; two in nature, <a id="l420"></a>The Logus  according to these men only dwelt &amp; operated in Iesus as the spirit of God doth in good men or as Christ was supposed to operate in Iesus. And if for eluding the force of scripture they said that <a id="l421"></a>The Logus  was born or died  they equivocated &amp; meant not <a id="l422"></a>what they said: for they accounted the Logus immortal  impassible &amp; unchangeable &amp; that the man alone was <a id="l423"></a>really born &amp; suffered.  And again if they said that Iesus did miracles they equivocated &amp; meant not <a id="l425"></a>the man but the Word. Iust as the Nicolaitans gave the common name of Iesus Christ to <a id="l426"></a>the composition of Iesus &amp; Christ &amp; called them one without meaning what they said, the Montanists gave the common name of Iesus  the Logus <a id="l427"></a>to the composition of Iesus &amp; the Logus &amp; called them one without meaning what they said &amp; therefore they  held the doctrine <a id="l428"></a>of the Nicolaitans. ffor by the Logus they meant what the ancienter Nicolaitans meant by <a id="l429"></a>Christ. The difference is only in words  They denyed that Iesus was the Logus &amp; that the Logus came in the flesh as much <a id="l430"></a>as the ancienter Nicolaitans denied that  Iesus was the Christ or that Christ came in the <a id="l431"></a>flesh &amp; in the same manner, &amp; therefore they were Nicolaitans &amp; liars &amp; antichristians in the sense of the scriptures.</p>
<p id="par29" class="i0">seem to have been the same with the opinion of the Patripassians Praxeas Hermogenes <a id="l432"></a>Noetus &amp; Sabellius the disciple of Noetus, excepting that these received not the prophesies of Montanus. ffor <a id="l433"></a>Ierome speaking of the Montanists saith: Illi Sabellij dogma rectantes Trinitatem in unius <a id="l434"></a>personæ angustias cogunt. He means the  Montanists κατα Æschian.</p>
<p id="par30">Praxeas  held such an union of the Logus with the Man Iesus as the Montanists <a id="l435"></a> did &amp; that he  was born &amp;  died in the same sense, that is not really but by imputation: <a id="l436"></a> or in language only:   being immortal &amp; impassible in himself &amp; only compassible <a id="l437"></a>to the man Iesus who alone was really passible.  And because he  made the Logus one person with the father,  Tertullian told him that he  <a id="l439"></a>made the father compassible &amp; crucified him in words which was blasphemy: &amp; hence  they were called Patripassians   The name was not owned by them but imposed upon them <a id="l441"></a>by  their enemies  as a consequence of their  words.  For Tertullian <a id="l442"></a>argues thus against Praxeas: Ergo, inquis, et nos eadem ratione Patrem mortuum dicentes qua <a id="l443"></a>vos filium non blasphemamus in Dominum Deum: non enim ex divina sed ex humana substan<a id="l444"></a>tia mortuum dicimus, – – – – – – blasphemavit ——— Times dicere passibilem quam dicis compassibilem.</p> 
<p id="par31">Sabellius was the disciple of Noetus &amp; held the same opinion with him, &amp; Theodoret tells us  that this heresy was  <a id="l445"></a>invented by Epigonius,  propagated by Cleomenes, &amp; renewed by Noetus. Now Sabellius <a id="l446"></a> made the <a id="l447"></a>father son &amp; H.G. . . . . . . . . . . . as Simon did. Alexander of Alexandria in his general Epistle tells us that <a id="l448"></a>the son was begotten not of nothing but  of the father, not after the <a id="l449"></a>manner of bodies by incisions &amp; efflux arising from divisions as seemed to Sabellius &amp; Valen<a id="l450"></a>tinus, but after an inexplicable manner. Which imports that Sabellius like the <a id="l451"></a>Valentinians derived the Son from the father by an efflux of substance after the manner of bodies with some <a id="l452"></a>separation not of the Son from the father but of the parts  which flowed out <a id="l453"></a> fom those which did not flow out:  yet so as to leave the father &amp; son one person <a id="l454"></a>actuated with no other life then that of the father. Or that  Or taught that the f s. &amp; h g. like the body soul &amp; spirit of a man, <a id="l455"></a>are three distinct substances &amp; yet  compose but one person. — that as Valentinus <a id="l456"></a>derived his Æons from the father by an efflux  &amp; projection of substance after the manner <a id="l457"></a>of bodies, with some separation  of  parts: so  did Sabellius derive the son from the <a id="l458"></a>father by an efflux of substance &amp; separation  of the parts flowing out from those which did <a id="l459"></a>not flow out,  as a ray of light by flowing out from the sun departs from the sun. But <a id="l460"></a>notwithstanding he made a connection between the  father &amp; son as one person   as a man &amp; his arm <a id="l461"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>stret<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ched out are but one, or as the body soul &amp; spirit are three <a id="l462"></a>distinct substances &amp; yet compose but one person <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p106r"> &lt;106r&gt; </span> And as the heathens &amp; the Gnosticks feigned that their Gods were first <a id="l463"></a>begotten &amp; then born, &amp; that the supreme Iupiter was both male &amp; <a id="l464"></a>female   Minerva  being born out of his brain,  &amp; Bacchus out of his <a id="l466"></a>thigh, according to the heathens  &amp; Ennœa the Minerva of the heathens being the first conception of his mind according to Simon <a id="l467"></a>&amp;  the Gnosticks:  so the  Montanists  feigned that the Son of God <a id="l468"></a>was begotten  before the  world began &amp; born when God said <a id="l469"></a>Fiat lux &amp; that he was born as it were out of the womb of the <a id="l470"></a>father. And  further; as the Gnosticks feigned that the Logus was <a id="l471"></a>first conceived in Gods mind as his active Wisdom  &amp; λόγος ενδιαθετος &amp; <a id="l472"></a>then emitted as it were out of his mouth  as his Word &amp; λόγος προφορικὸς &amp; thereby born  <a id="l474"></a> the son of God: so Montanists <a id="l475"></a>taught that the Logus was first conceived as wisdom in Gods Mind &amp;  then emitted <a id="l476"></a> as  a Word sent out of his mouth  by eructation. Itaque Sophiam <a id="l477"></a>– – – – – sermonem optimum. Thus did the Montanists teach that the Son <a id="l478"></a>was first conceived as it were in Gods womb before the creation in order <a id="l479"></a>to contrive the univers &amp; then born  of him in order to produce outwardly what <a id="l480"></a>God had conceived in his mind.  And so the  Theology of the <a id="l481"></a>Montanists is of the same kind with that of the heathens &amp; Gnosticks &amp; <a id="l482"></a>the big bellied Father &amp; his Son in this Theology is the  Iupiter of the heathens &amp; <a id="l483"></a>Gnosticks &amp; the son of this Iupiter. And whereas the Gnostick <a id="l484"></a> And this son of Iupiters brain was both male &amp; female like Minerva For What the heathens called Minerva &amp; the Gnosticks Ennœa, Montanus called Sophia;  before his birth &amp; Logus  afterwards <a id="l485"></a>making but one Æon of  Ennœa, Nus &amp; Logus,  &amp; feigning that this Æon conceived <a id="l486"></a>all things virtually in himself  as Ennœa &amp; Nus &amp; the Platonic Logus or Idea <a id="l487"></a>of Ideas were feigned to do. And for the unity of this Trinity the Montanists alledged the text in <a id="l488"></a>the first epistle of Iohn: There are three that beare record the  spirit the water &amp; the blood <a id="l489"></a>&amp; these three are one,  pretending that the  spirit the  water &amp; the blood  represented the <a id="l490"></a>father son &amp; h.g. the spirit signifying the father (Iohn 4.24) the water the holy g. (Iohn 7.38, 39) &amp; the blood the <a id="l491"></a>son.</p>
<p id="par32">And tho the Montanists for  reconciling their  heresy to the monarchy of the <a id="l492"></a>father, made the son inferior to him, yet in some respects they made him equal. ffor the <a id="l493"></a>text of Paul τὸ ἐιναι ἰσα θεω  they  alledged for an equality, taking ἰσα <a id="l494"></a> for an adjective of equality, whereas with a dative case after it, it is always <a id="l495"></a>an adverb of similitude.</p>
<p id="par33">And  it is further observable that they made Christ to be a part of the fathers substance <a id="l496"></a>not by juxta-position after the manner of bodies, but by  the son's being in the father <a id="l498"></a>&amp; the father in the son in all places;  both of them being every where present to the other  which kind of conjunction some some have called περιχυν εσις &amp; circumincessio. So Tertullian:<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> Habes patrem in cælis, habes filium in terris: <a id="l500"></a>Non est separatio ista, sed dispositio divina. Cæterum scimus Deum etiam intra abyssos esse <a id="l501"></a>&amp; ubique consistere sed vi et potestate: Filium quoque ut individuum, cum ipso ubique. </p>

For that they did so is manifest out of Irenæus [l. 1. c. 1. sect. 9, 10. &amp; <a id="l633"></a> c. 5 sec. 2] &amp; the excerpta taken out of Theodotus in the end of the <a id="l634"></a>works of Clemens Alexandrinus.

<p id="par50">① The Christian religion is founded in beleiving one God &amp; one Lord &amp; <a id="l642"></a>acknowledging the incarnation &amp; passion of this Lord, &amp; the Gnosticks generally <a id="l643"></a> eluded all the articles of this faith. They denyed one God &amp; one <a id="l644"></a>Lord by distinguishing them into more then one &amp; giving away their <a id="l645"></a>worship to fals Gods &amp; fals Lords; as when they derived several Æons <a id="l646"></a>from the first God &amp; tell us that one of those Æons was the creator <a id="l647"></a>of heaven &amp; earth, another was the father of Christ, one was Christ <a id="l648"></a>another was the Saviour another was the Word another was Iesus the son of Mary. They eluded <a id="l649"></a>the incarnation &amp; the passion by saying either that Iesus Christ had a <a id="l650"></a>phantastical body or that Christ or the Saviour or the Word was impassible &amp; only <a id="l651"></a>descended upon &amp; dwelt in Iesus as the holy spirit doth in a good man. So Irenæus tells <a id="l652"></a>us that all heresies  say there is one God; but by an evil opinion change <a id="l653"></a>him, being ungrateful to him who made them as the gentiles were  <a id="l654"></a>by their Idolatry. [Iren. l. 1. c. 19]. And again: They blaspheme also  <a id="l655"></a>our Lord, dividing Iesus from Christ &amp; Christ from the  Saviour &amp; <a id="l656"></a>the Saviour from the Word &amp; the Word from the Only begotten [Lib. 4 in Proæ-<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p108v"> &lt;108v&gt; </span> And again.  All the hereticks aforesaid although in tongue they <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>confess<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l657"></a>one Iesus Christ yet they deride themselves, thinking one thing &amp; saying <a id="l658"></a>another [Lib. 3. c. 18] And  a little after For if one suffered, the other remained <a id="l659"></a>impassible, one was born the other descended on him who was born &amp; after<a id="l660"></a>wards left him, they are manifested to be not one but two. [Lib. 3. c. 18] And again <a id="l661"></a>They understand Christ to be one &amp; Iesus to be another &amp; teach not one <a id="l662"></a>Christ but many, &amp; if they say that they were united, yet they shew that <a id="l663"></a>one suffered the other remained impassible Lib. 3. c. 19. And again: <a id="l664"></a>Christ was made flesh according to none of the opinions of the hereticks <a id="l665"></a>ffor if any one search the rules of them all, he will find that the <a id="l666"></a>Word of God &amp; the Christ which is above is  by all the hereticks <a id="l667"></a>induced without flesh &amp; impassible. For some think that he was <a id="l668"></a>manifested in appearance as a transfigured man: for they say that he was neither <a id="l669"></a>born nor incarnate. Others, that he did not so much as assume the <a id="l670"></a>figure of a man, but descended as a dove upon Iesus who was born <a id="l671"></a>of Mary.  Therefore Iohn the disciple shewing that all <a id="l672"></a>those were fals witnesses, saith: <em class="underline">And the Word was made flesh &amp; dwelt <a id="l673"></a>among us</em>. [Lib. 3. c. 11.] These opinions therefore according to Irenæus began in the days <a id="l674"></a>of the Apostles, &amp; as Iohn condemned them in his Gospel so he condemned <a id="l675"></a>in his Epistles saying: He is Antichrist . . . . . . . also in the Apocalyps. <a id="l676"></a> &amp; are called by the Apostle Paul the mystery of iniquity, that mystery <a id="l677"></a>which was to work till the coming of the Man of sin [&amp; is written in the <a id="l678"></a>forehead of the Whore of Babylon &amp; that iniquity which is upon the heads of the Beast. ffor the Nicolaitans were to <a id="l679"></a>continue till Christ at his second coming should  fight against them with the sword of his mouth (Apoc 2.16) &amp; <a id="l681"></a>destroy the man of sin with the breath of his mouth &amp; the bright<a id="l682"></a>ness of his coming.] whom Christ should destroy with the breath of his mouth <a id="l683"></a>&amp; the brightness of his coming.] whom Christ should destroy with the breath of his mouth <a id="l684"></a>&amp; the brightness of his [second] coming. ffor the doctrine of the Nicolaitans was to continue till <a id="l685"></a>Christ should come &amp; fight against them with the sword of his mouth Apoc 2.<a id="l686"></a>16 &amp; 19.15, 21.<br><br></p>

<p id="par52">③ The Gnosticks after the manner of the Platonists &amp; Cabbalists considerred the <a id="l693"></a>thoughts or  Ideas or intellectual objects seated in Gods mind as real <a id="l694"></a>Beings or substances, &amp; supposed them to be male &amp; female &amp; to generate <a id="l695"></a>by emission of substance as animals generate or as the heathens supposed <a id="l696"></a>their Gods to generate &amp; thence accounted them consubstantial – – – – – – – – <a id="l697"></a>– – – – – – – but not the spiritual to the animal.</p>

<p id="par55" class="i0">ενδιάθετος ὴ προφόρικὸς, &amp; feigned that <em class="underline">silence</em> preceded the <em class="underline">Word</em> &amp; thence <a id="l707"></a>called <em class="underline">Ennœa</em> by the name of <em class="underline">Sige</em>: Irenæus tells these Gnosticks that <a id="l708"></a>Logus &amp; Sige could not be in Bythus at one &amp; the same time, no more <a id="l709"></a>than light &amp; darkness. And that if they say  that this λόγος was  <a id="l710"></a>ἐνδιάθετος (for it seems this was the language of these Gnosticks) then <a id="l711"></a>Σιγη will be also ἐνδιάθετος: which two, saith he, are inconsistent, &amp; <a id="l712"></a>therefore Σιγὴ is not ἐνδιάθετος.

<p id="par56">The doctrine therefore that the λόγος  or Word <a id="l714"></a>of God was the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος the inherent Word of the father &amp; was  exerted or emitted as it were by speaking &amp; thereby generated <a id="l716"></a>into a Son before the world began came from the Gnosticks Basilides <a id="l717"></a>&amp; Valentinus &amp; their disciples Secundus Ptolomæus <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> Marcus <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> Heracleon <a id="l718"></a>who  from Sige derived Nus &amp; Logus &amp; perhaps also from Saturninus the fellow disciple of Basilides, &amp; from Me<a id="l719"></a>nander the common master of Saturninus &amp; Basilides &amp; disciple of Simon. <a id="l720"></a>ffor Irenæus tells us that Valentinus had his opinions <sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> from <a id="l721"></a>his masters &amp; <sup>k</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> blames Saturninus Basilides Valentinus &amp; Marcion <a id="l722"></a>&amp; the Gnosticks in general for pretending to know the genera<a id="l723"></a>tion of the son &amp;  explaining it by comparing it to <a id="l724"></a>a word spoken by a man.

For <sup>l</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> Eusebius <a id="l726"></a>tells us that Marcellus in making Quiet to precede <a id="l727"></a>the Logus, imitated that impious ring-leader of the hereticks [Simon] who <a id="l728"></a>said  atheistically ἠν Θεὸς καὶ Σιγὴ <em class="underline">There was God &amp; Silence</em>. <a id="l729"></a>And <sup>m</sup><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> Gregory Nazianzen alluding to this doctrine of <a id="l730"></a>Simon &amp; his followers said that the Simons &amp; the <a id="l731"></a>Marcions &amp; the Valentines &amp; the Basilideses &amp; <a id="l732"></a>Cerdons &amp; Cerinthuses &amp; Carpocrateses &amp; all their <a id="l733"></a>trifles &amp; juggling tricks were delivered τω ἑαυτων βυθω καὶ <a id="l734"></a> σιγη to their own Bythus &amp; Sige or abyss &amp; silence.

<p id="par57">② As the Sephiroths  in the Iewish Cabbala were the  powers  affections <a id="l749"></a>Ideas operations &amp; dignities of God the father considered as so many divine persons (namely his Crown  his Wisdom <a id="l751"></a>his Prudence, his Magnificence, his Power, his Beauty, his Eternity, his Glory, his <a id="l752"></a> being the support &amp; foundation of all things,  &amp; his Reign:) so the Æons of the Gnosticks were of the <a id="l753"></a>same kind. Simon said that  Ennœa  was the first conception or Idea <a id="l754"></a>of his mind &amp; made her the mother of the other Æons or Idea of Ideas.  The <a id="l755"></a>Nicolaitans &amp; Cerinthus  gave the names of <a id="l756"></a>  Arche  &amp; Nus to the first emission <a id="l757"></a>of Ennœa  &amp; that of Logus to the next emission The first emission they called  also Monogenes &amp; Ialdabaoth &amp; said that Logus was <a id="l758"></a>the son of Monogenes.

Valentinus &amp; his followers <a id="l761"></a>called the first God Bythus &amp; Megethos, Profundity &amp; Magnitude meaning without <a id="l762"></a>bounds &amp; this answers to his Cabbalistical name En-soph the Infinite.

And that these Gnosticks by their Æons <a id="l765"></a>understood the powers  affections operations &amp; Ideas of the supreme God is <a id="l766"></a>manifest by what Epiphanius cites out of their writings in these Words. <em class="underline">In the <a id="l767"></a>beginning</em>, say they, <em class="underline">he who of himself is the father conteined all things within <a id="l768"></a>himself. Then the Ennœa which was in him, (which some call Ennœa &amp; others <a id="l769"></a>properly Charis because she effuses the treasures of Megethus Magnitude</em> [Æn-soph] <a id="l770"></a><em class="underline">upon those who are from Magnitude, but others more truly call her Sige <a id="l771"></a>Silence because by cogitation without the use of speech Magnitude performs all things,) She, I say, the uncorrupt Æonia being willing to extricate <a id="l773"></a>her self from her bonds enticed Magnitude to her embraces, &amp; brought <a id="l774"></a>forth the father of truth whom those that are perfect</em>, [the Christian  Cabbalists <em class="underline">call the Man</em> <a id="l775"></a>[Adam Kadmon &amp; Arich Anpin] <em class="underline">because he bears the likeness of the Vnbe<a id="l776"></a>gotten.

This Man was the Æon which  they also called Monogenes Nus <a id="l778"></a>&amp; Arche. He was the father of Cochmah &amp; Binah according to the Cabbalists &amp; therefore is here called the father. Ptolomæus another of these Gnosticks assigned to the supreme father <a id="l779"></a>two wives <em class="underline">Ennœa</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Thelesis</em>, Vnderstanding &amp; Will &amp; called them the affections <a id="l780"></a>of the unknown father &amp; said that the Vnderstanding was the older wife <a id="l781"></a>because the understanding precedes the will, &amp; that Ennœa thought of an <a id="l782"></a>emission but could not emitt it till the power of the Will came to her <a id="l783"></a>assistance, &amp; then she emitted <em class="underline">Nus</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Alethea</em>. And whereas the Gnosticks <a id="l784"></a>made <em class="underline">Nus</em> the son of <em class="underline">Ennœa</em>, Irenæus tells them<sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> that they should rather <a id="l785"></a>have made <em class="underline">Ennœa</em> the daughter of <em class="underline">Nus</em> because <em class="underline">Nus</em> the Mind, is the <a id="l786"></a>fountain of thinking &amp; <em class="underline">Ennœa</em>, Thinking, is the motion.

And all these things are but one thing in <a id="l792"></a>several degrees &amp; have place only in the mind of man. They err therefore <a id="l793"></a>in  ascribing to God the affections &amp; passions of men &amp; making him a <a id="l794"></a>compound. For God is not as man, nor are his thoughts like ours. He is simple <a id="l795"></a>&amp; not compound. He is all like &amp; equal to himself, all sense all spirit, all <a id="l796"></a>perception all Ennœa, all λόγος all ear, all eye, all light. He is all sense <a id="l797"></a>which cannot be separated from it self, nor is there any thing in him which <a id="l798"></a>can be emitted from any thing else. Thus does Irenæus represent &amp; confute <a id="l799"></a>the Metaphysicks of the Gnosticks.

<p id="par91">5 The  philosophical errors of the Gnosticks consisted chiefly in denying one God <a id="l912"></a>&amp; one Lord, &amp; in eluding the incarnation &amp; the passion of the son of God. They denyed <a id="l913"></a>one God &amp; one Lord by distinguishing them into more then one, as when they  <a id="l914"></a>derived several Æons from the first God &amp; tell us that one of those <a id="l915"></a>Æons was the creator of heaven &amp; earth, another was the father of  <a id="l916"></a> Christ;  one was the  Christ, another was the Saviour, another was <a id="l917"></a>Iesus the son of Mary They eluded the incarnation &amp; the passion by saying either that  Iesus  had a phantastical body or that Christ was impassible &amp; only dwelt in Iesus as the holy spirit doth in a good <a id="l918"></a>man. And these opinions were as ancient as the Apostles days being <a id="l919"></a>taught by the Nicolaitans &amp; by Cerinthus ffor in opposition to these opinions Iohn saith, He is Antichrist that <a id="l920"></a>denyeth the father &amp; the son or that Iesus is the Christ or that <a id="l921"></a>Iesus Christ is come in the flesh. And Peter that there should be fals teachers amongst <a id="l922"></a>Christians who should bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that bought them. And Iude</p>

And whereas the <a id="l943"></a>Nicolaitans said that Christ descended upon Iesus, the Gnos<a id="l944"></a>ticks who received the Gospel &amp; Epistle of Iohn &amp;  acknowledged <a id="l945"></a>the λόγος, changed the languages &amp; said that  the λόγος <a id="l946"></a>or Word which was emitted  descended upon Iesus Christ &amp; dwelt in him &amp; did the  supernatural operations. And from them this <a id="l948"></a>opinion descended to Hermogenes Tatian Montanus,  Proclus Æschines, <a id="l949"></a>Praxeas, Tertullian, Artemas, Noetus, Sabellius, Paul of Samosat, Marcellus, <a id="l950"></a>Eustathius &amp; Photinus. Alll these hereticks therefore held <a id="l951"></a>the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, but yet with some diversity <a id="l952"></a>of language &amp; circumstances. For some of them as Proclus &amp; Tertullian held the λόγος to be <a id="l953"></a>a person,  or  substance endued with a proper life will &amp; under<a id="l954"></a>standing &amp; others  as Hermogenes Æschines, Praxeas, Noetus <a id="l955"></a>Sabellius Paul Marcellus &amp; Photinus held that the λογος <a id="l956"></a> was only a power seated in some dilated part of the <a id="l957"></a>fathers substance without any other life will or understanding <a id="l958"></a>then that of the father  And again, some of them as Paul Marcellus Eustathius &amp; Photinus held that the λόγος only <a id="l961"></a>dwelt in Iesus Christ as the holy spirit doth in good men &amp; <a id="l962"></a>others as Montanus Hermogenes Praxeas  Tertullian Noetus &amp; Sabellius that he was united to Iesus so as to become <a id="l963"></a>passible.  And thence  Hermogenes Praxeas Noetus &amp; <a id="l964"></a>Sabellius were called patripassians. But all agreed in distinguishing between the divine  nature of Christ  called the Word, &amp;  the man Iesus Christ who took his beginning of the virgin &amp; was assumed <a id="l968"></a>&amp; actuated by the Word.</p>
<p id="par100"> Tatian professes that he was educated in the learning  of the heathens &amp; followed the philosophy of the Assyrians.  And accordingly he held  with the heathen Philosophers that all things were produced out of the substance of God &amp; that <a id="l969"></a>the Word  was   Verbum prolativum emitted before all things in order to create the world &amp; was a part of the <a id="l970"></a>fathers substance distinguished &amp; divided from the rest of his substance in respect of <a id="l971"></a>life but not separated from it: &amp; that as a man commmunicates his mind to another <a id="l972"></a>by speaking without diminishing his own understanding &amp;  knowledg &amp; one lamp  kindles ano<a id="l973"></a>ther without diminishing its own light so the father gave  a distinct life  with reason <a id="l974"></a>understanding &amp; wisdom to the  son without  losing his own λόγος ἐνδιαθετος &amp; becoming ἄλόγος His words are.</p>
<p id="par101">And accordingly he taught  with the heathen Philosophers that  all things were produced out of the substance of <a id="l977"></a>God &amp; that the Word which was always seated in him  at length became Verbum prolati<a id="l978"></a>vum being emitted before all things in order to create the world, &amp; that this emitted <a id="l979"></a>word was  generated by participation of the fathers substance,  but not by division from it but not –– – – – ἄλόγος,  His words are . . . . . . .  After he had received the Æons of Valentinus <a id="l984"></a>he fell in with the doctrines of the Montanists. This was the philosophy of Tatian <a id="l985"></a>before he  lapsed into the Gnostical opinions of many Æons &amp; of the Word's <a id="l986"></a>having a phantastical body.</p>
<p id="par102">From them this opinion descended to Tatian, Montanus, Tertullian &amp; others <a id="l987"></a>He did not make the Word a mere vertue or operation but  permanent emission consubstan<a id="l988"></a>tiall to the father. ffor Pope <sup>o</sup><sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup> Iulius tells us: Marcelli fides confessioque Nicææ spectata est <a id="l989"></a>cum Arianis contradiceret.

At the same time Lucifer Calaritanus Eusebius Versellensis &amp; some other Bishops whom Constantius had banished being set at liberty by Iulian came to Alexandria &amp; Lucifer went thence to Antioch &amp;  ordeined Paulinus bishop of that City.

For those of the consubstantial faith had hitherto differed <a id="l1136"></a>in the use of the words,  some still calling the   three persons one <a id="l1137"></a> usia &amp; one hypostasis  &amp; for doing so being  <a id="l1138"></a>  accounted Sabellians by others who called them three <a id="l1139"></a>hypostases.

As several heathen nations worshipped several Gods in several manners &amp; yet were in general of one religion: so all the particular heresies were in general but one  heretical religion which religion like the heathen consisted in worshipping false Gods. <a id="l1310"></a></p>
<p id="par122">Iohn saith that  there were even in his days many Antichrists &amp;  <a id="l1311"></a>gives them all  common character that they denyed <a id="l1312"></a>the father &amp; the son, which is all one as to say that instead of the father &amp; son <a id="l1313"></a>they worshipped false Gods. This was the definition of an Antichrist. And this Character agrees to all the heresies hitherto</p>
