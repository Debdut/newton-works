<p id="par3">Now if the new Articles be omitted the Creed of the Latines called the Apostles Creed will <a id="l16"></a>be reduced to this fform. <em class="underline">I believe in God, the ffather Almighty, <a id="l17"></a>maker of heaven &amp; earth, &amp; in Iesus Christ his only son our <a id="l18"></a>Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius <a id="l19"></a>Pilate, was crucified dead &amp; buried, the third day he rose <a id="l20"></a>again from the dead,  ascended into heaven ; from thence he <a id="l21"></a>shall come to judge the quick &amp; the dead; And I beleive in <a id="l22"></a>the holy Ghost</em>. This Creed  is the same in substance with <a id="l23"></a>the first Creed of Irenæus &amp; therefore conteins the primitive <a id="l24"></a>faith which according to Irenæus was preached to all nations <a id="l25"></a>in order to baptism, &amp; by the recital of which all Christians <a id="l26"></a>from one end of the earth to the other end thereof knew one <a id="l27"></a>another to be Christians. Its articles are generally to be met <a id="l28"></a>with in the ancient Creeds of both Greeks &amp; Latines: but in the <a id="l29"></a>following form it suits better with the Creeds of the Greeks  &amp; in the last article thereof includes all the Articles which have been added to the Creed in the language of the Scriptu<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>re<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> I <em class="underline">beleive in one God, the ffather almighty, maker of heaven &amp; <a id="l30"></a>earth, &amp; of all things visible &amp; invisible, &amp; in one Lord Iesus <a id="l31"></a>Christ the Son of God, who was born of the Virgin Mary, suffered <a id="l32"></a>under Pontius Pilate, was buried,  the third day rose again <a id="l33"></a>from the dead:  He ascended into heaven  &amp;  shall <a id="l34"></a>come to judge the quick &amp; the dead . And I beleive in the <a id="l35"></a>holy Ghost who spake by the Prophets</em>. And if it be thought fit  the Articles sitteth at the right hand of God. The resurrection of the body &amp; life everlasting  may be <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>instituted<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> by way of explication  the same being short &amp; in scripture &amp; received into the Creed by the christians of the second century without occasioning any disturbance in the Churches. </p>
<p id="par4"> Now this Creed is <a id="l36"></a>easy to be understood by the meanest capacities &amp; so  is fit <a id="l37"></a>to be proposed to all men, as  the first principles of religion <a id="l38"></a>ought to be, &amp; on that account may properly be compared <a id="l39"></a>to milk for babes.  It is short &amp; easy to be remembered <a id="l40"></a>as the Symbols of religion ought to be. All its Articles are in the scriptures in express words &amp; so liable to no disputes.  It conteins not repetitions nor mere <a id="l41"></a>Theories like some of the Articles which we have omitted, but prac<a id="l42"></a>tical truths on which the whole practise of religion depends, <a id="l43"></a>&amp; therefore a system of faith fit to be learned in the first place as the foundation <a id="l44"></a>of all religion. We must beleive in one God that we may love <a id="l45"></a> &amp; fear him. We must beleive that he is the father Al<a id="l46"></a>mighty, or first author of all things by the almighty power of <a id="l47"></a>his will, that we may thank &amp; worship him &amp; him alone for  our being <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p044r"> &lt;44r&gt; </span> and for all the blessings of this life ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 43v &gt; </span> ✝ We must beleive that this is the God of moses &amp; the Iews who created heaven &amp; earth <a id="l48"></a>&amp; the sea &amp; all things therein as is exprest in the ten commandments, that we may not take his name in vain nor <a id="l49"></a>worship images or visible resemblances nor have (in our worship) any other <a id="l50"></a>God then him. For he is without similitude he is the invisible God whom no eye hath seen nor can <a id="l51"></a>see, &amp; therefore is not to be worshipped in any visible shape. He is the only <a id="l52"></a>invisible God &amp; the only God whom we are to worship &amp; therefore we <a id="l53"></a>are not to worship any visible image picture likeness or  form. We are not <a id="l54"></a>forbidden to give the name of Gods to Angels &amp; Kings but we are forbidden <a id="l55"></a>to worship them as Gods. <em class="underline">For tho there be that are called Gods whether <a id="l56"></a>in heaven or in earth (as there are Gods many &amp; Lords many) yet to us <a id="l57"></a>there is but one God the ffather of whom are all things &amp; we in him &amp; <a id="l58"></a>our Lord Iesus Christ by whom are all things &amp; we in him</em>, that is, but <a id="l59"></a>one God &amp; one Lord in our worship: <em class="underline">One God &amp; one mediator between <a id="l60"></a>God &amp; man the man Christ Iesus</em>.  We are forbidden to worship two Gods but we are not forbidden to worship one God, &amp; one Lord: one God for creating all things &amp; one Lord for redeeming us with his blood. We must not pray to two Gods, but we may pray to one God in the name of one Lord. We must beleive therefore in one Lord <a id="l61"></a> Iesus Christ that we may behave our selves obediently towards him <a id="l62"></a>as subjects &amp; keep his laws, &amp; give him that honour &amp; glory &amp; worship which is due to <a id="l63"></a>him as our Lord &amp; King or else we are not his people. We must beleive that this Lord Iesus is <a id="l64"></a>the Christ, or Messiah the Prince predicted by Daniel, &amp; we must worship him as the Messiah or else we are <a id="l65"></a>no Christians. The Iews who were taught to have but one God were also taught to expect a king, &amp; the Christians are taught in their Creed to have the same God &amp; to beleive that Iesus is that King. And that we may give him the more honour we must <a id="l66"></a>beleive also that he is the Son of God  born of the Virgin Mary <a id="l67"></a>without any other ffather then God himself. <em class="underline">Who is a lyar</em>, saith Iohn, <em class="underline">but he that denyeth that Iesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist <a id="l68"></a>that denyeth the ffather &amp; the Son</em>. And we are authorized also to call him God: for the name of God is in him. Exod. 23.21.  And we must beleive also that <a id="l69"></a>by his incarnation of the Virgin he came in the flesh not in appearance only but <a id="l70"></a>really &amp; truly , <em class="underline">being in all things made like unto his brethren</em> (Heb. 2 <a id="l71"></a>17) for which reason he is called also the son of man. <em class="underline">For many deceivers</em>, saith Iohn, <em class="underline">are entred into the world who <a id="l72"></a>confess not that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver <a id="l73"></a>&amp; an Antichrist</em>. 2. Iohn. 7.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 44r resumes &gt; </span>  We must beleive that he was crucified <a id="l84"></a>being slain at the Passover as a propitiatory sacrifice for us, that <a id="l85"></a>in gratitude we may give him honour &amp; glory &amp; blessing as the <a id="l86"></a>Lamb of God which was slain &amp; hath redeemed us &amp; washed  us from our sins in his own blood &amp; made us Kings &amp; Priests unto God his ffather. We must beleive that he <a id="l88"></a>rose again from the dead that we may expect the like re<a id="l89"></a>surrection &amp; that he ascended into heaven to prepare a <a id="l90"></a>place or mansion for the blessed that by the expectation <a id="l91"></a>of such a glorious &amp; incorruptible inheritance we may en<a id="l92"></a>deavour to deserve it. <span class="ns">☉</span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 43v &gt; </span> <span class="ns">☉</span> We must beleive  that he  is exalted to the right hand of God (Acts 2 <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) or is next in <a id="l93"></a>dignity to God the ffather Almighty, being the first begotten the heir of all things &amp; Lord over all the creation next under <a id="l94"></a>God, &amp; we must give him suitable worship. For because he humbled <a id="l95"></a>himself to death even the death of the cross therefore God hath <a id="l96"></a>highly exalted him &amp; given him a name above every name that at <a id="l97"></a>the name of Iesus every knee should bow of things in heaven &amp; earth <a id="l98"></a>&amp; under the earth &amp; every tongue confess that Iesus Christ is Lord <a id="l99"></a>to the glory of God the ffather.  The worship which we are directed in <a id="l100"></a>scripture to give to Iesus Christ respects his death &amp; exaltation to the <a id="l101"></a>right hand of God &amp; is given to him as our Lord &amp; King &amp; tends <a id="l102"></a>to the glory of God the ffather. Should we give the father that <a id="l103"></a>worship which is due to the Son we should be Patripassians, &amp; should <a id="l104"></a>we give the Son all that worship which is  due to the father we should make two creators &amp; be guilty of polytheism  <a id="l106"></a>&amp; in both cases we should practically deny the father &amp; the son. <a id="l107"></a>We may give blessing &amp; honour &amp; glory &amp; power unto God &amp; the Lamb together <a id="l108"></a>but it must be in different respects, to God as he is God the ffather Almighty <a id="l109"></a>who created the heaven &amp; earth &amp; to the Lamb as he is the Lord who was slain for us <a id="l110"></a>&amp; washed away our sins in his own blood &amp; is exalted to the right hand of <a id="l111"></a>God the father. In worshipping them we must keep to the Characters <a id="l112"></a>given them in the  primitive Creed &amp; then we are safe. We must also beleive that <a id="l113"></a>Iesus Christ shall come to judge the quick &amp; the dead, that is to reign over <a id="l114"></a>them with justice &amp; judgment untill he shall subdue all rule &amp; all <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 44r resumes &gt; </span> We must beleive that he sits at the right hand of God or is next  in dignity to God Almighty &amp; give him suitable worship because he humbled himself to death even the death of the cross therefore God hath highly exalted him &amp; given him a name above every name that at the name of Iesus every knee should bow. We must beleive also that he shall come not from the right hand of God but from heaven to  judge the quick &amp; the dead, that is, to reign over <a id="l116"></a>them with justice &amp;  judgement untill he shal subdue all rule &amp; all authority &amp; power, &amp; all enemies <a id="l117"></a>be put under his feet the last of which is death &amp; by consequence <a id="l118"></a>untill all the dead be  raised &amp; judged.  For he sits at the right hand of God not only in this world but also in that which is to come untill all enemies be put under his feet. And this his coming to judgment we must beleive that we may with understanding pray for the coming of this kingdom &amp; fit our selves to stand before him in that day, &amp; to <a id="l121"></a>deserve an early resurrection, knowing that the dead in Christ <a id="l122"></a>shall rise first &amp; judgement shall begin at the house of <a id="l123"></a>God &amp; that the saints who are first judged shall reign with <a id="l124"></a>him over the quick &amp; dead   untill all the dead be raised in the body &amp;  be <a id="l125"></a>judged, &amp; the ungodly, the blasphemers, the unjust, the lawless <a id="l126"></a>&amp; all the workers of iniquity be sent into places of misery <a id="l127"></a>suitable to their merits &amp; the saints go to the place of eternal happiness which Christ <a id="l128"></a>is now preparing for them in heaven. And we must beleive <a id="l129"></a>that there is a holy prophetic spirit by which Moses &amp; the <a id="l130"></a>Prophets &amp; Apostles were influenced that we may study <a id="l131"></a>their writings as the Oracles of truth, &amp; thereby grow in <a id="l132"></a>grace &amp; in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ to the end <a id="l133"></a>of our lives.</p>
<p id="par5">For besides the first principles &amp; fundamentals of <a id="l134"></a>religion conteined in the doctrine of baptism &amp; laying on of hands &amp; in the Creed which all are to learn <a id="l135"></a>before baptism, &amp; which the Apostle therefore compares <a id="l136"></a>to milk for babes, there are many truths of great im<a id="l137"></a>portance but more difficult to be understood &amp; not ab<a id="l138"></a>solutely necessary to salvation. And these the Apostle compares to strong meats for men of full age who by <a id="l139"></a>use have their senses exercised to discern both good &amp; <a id="l140"></a>evil.

<p id="par7" class="i0">The Church catholick during the two first Centuries  accounted the <a id="l159"></a>unity of the Deity monarchical, &amp; were zealous against a metaphysical unity <a id="l160"></a></p>
<p id="par8">This Tertullian who was for a metaphysical unity testifies  in his book against Praxias in these words – – – – – – – – This was the metaphysical <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>belief<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of the Montanists Oeconomy [of the Montanists consisted in explaining how the f. s. &amp; h.G. were one by unity of substance. And The credentium pars major <a id="l162"></a>was certainly the Church Catholick. These both Greeks &amp; Latins were affrighted &amp; waxed pale at this meta<a id="l163"></a>physical Oeconomy [of the Montanists:  &amp; this Oeconomy consisted in explaining how the father son <a id="l164"></a>&amp; holy Ghost were one by unity of substance]  &amp; opposed to it  their <a id="l165"></a>own tradition of a  monarchical unity of God &amp; Christ  &amp; did  it <a id="l166"></a>with  zeale pronouncing the word monarchy aloud. As Irenæus tells us that same faith was preacht in all the Churches throughout the whole world in his day &amp; that illiterate Churches in  Germany in keeping to their traditions were impatient &amp; ready to stop their ears <a id="l168"></a>when they heard the opinions of the ancient hereticks,  &amp; in like manner, the common people whom <a id="l169"></a>Tertullian calls simplices &amp; imprudentes, both Greeks &amp; Latines were impatient  &amp; in a passion at hearing the metaphysical <a id="l170"></a> Oeconomy of the Montanists &amp; with zeale opposed it to their own faith of a monarchical unity. And therefore the faith of a monarchical unity was the tradition of the Church Catholick till the days of Tertullian. For this testimony of Tertullian <a id="l171"></a>being against his own party is very strong &amp; unexceptionable. The common <a id="l172"></a>people to whom the Gospel was preached from the beginning were tenacious of <a id="l173"></a>their traditions.  Tertullian,  &amp; such as were bred up in the learning of the heathens &amp; Cabbalists  being puffed up with <a id="l174"></a>a conceipt of their own learning &amp; wisdome  looked upon the generality of Christians <a id="l175"></a>as ignorant &amp; silly people &amp; by degrees   mixed their own metaphysical learning with the Christian religion.</p>
<p id="par9">About 70 years after Tertullian wrote against Praxeas,</p>
<p id="par10">The heathen Philosophers  &amp; first hereticks generally <a id="l177"></a>made their Gods  to be either part, or powers of one <a id="l178"></a>substance.

<p id="par20">In the days of Pope Victor or not long before, in <a id="l229"></a>opposition to the Gnosticks who denyed the resurrection of the body <a id="l230"></a>&amp; maintained that the souls of men after various transmigra<a id="l231"></a>tions returned into God, some Latines began to add the <a id="l232"></a>resurrection of the body &amp; life everlasting to the end of <a id="l233"></a>their Creed.</p>
<p id="par21"> The easy admission of hereticks into the Church of Rome <a id="l234"></a>gave them opportunity  of propagating their doctrines early in  that Church. And those doctrines were most apt to be propagated <a id="l236"></a> which were most generally  taught by the hereticks: Such as was the opinion that the son of God arose from the father as a river  from the fountain a tree from the root &amp; a ray from the sun &amp; that he  was the internal wisdom reason &amp; word <a id="l238"></a>of the ffather without which the father was ασοφος &amp; ἀλογος . ffor <a id="l239"></a>this was the  common language of Montanus &amp; Paul of Samosat &amp; Sabellius &amp; <a id="l240"></a>had its rise from the Gnosticks who  considered their Æons as such emissions &amp; called them Ennoia, νους,  λογος  σοφια δυναμις &amp; such like attributes powers &amp; vertues. by the names of  And this sort of language insinuated it self into the Churches by degrees in the third &amp; fourth Centuries [And <a id="l242"></a>this opinion overspread the Roman Empire in the third &amp; fourth century] For Alexander Bishop of <a id="l243"></a>Alexandria in a letter which he wrote to all the bishops of the Church <a id="l244"></a>catholic against Arius, relates that  Arius had been <a id="l245"></a>condemned by a Council of almost 100 Bishops of Egypt ,  <a id="l246"></a>this doctrine  &amp; teaching (amongst other things) that the Son of God was neque verum ac genuinum Dei Verbum nec vera ejusdem sapi<a id="l247"></a>entia – – – abusive autem Verbum dicitur atque sapientia: quippe <a id="l248"></a>cum et ipse extiterit per proprium Dei Verbum et per sapientiam <a id="l249"></a>quæ in Deo est in qua Deus tum cætera omnia tum eum ipsum <a id="l250"></a>fecit. And  to this opinion of Arius Alexander  replies. Quod <a id="l251"></a>si filius ratio Patris est ac sapientia, quomodo fuit tempus cum non <a id="l252"></a>esset? Perinde enim est ac si dicerent ἄλογον και ἄσοφον ποτὲ τὸν θεόν, <a id="l253"></a>Deum aliquando rationis et sapientiæ expertem fuisse. This letter being sent to all the bishops was subscribed by some &amp; rejected by <a id="l254"></a>others. And  they that subscribed it were doubtless of  the same opinion with Alexander above mentioned </p>
<p id="par22"> This doctrine was also proclaimed by the Emperor Constantine the <a id="l259"></a>great in all the cities of the Roman Empire. For when he had wrote without success to <a id="l260"></a>Alexander &amp; Arius to forbear their frivolous disputes  but could not prevail &amp; therefore resolved <a id="l261"></a>to suppress the party of Arius, &amp; for that end to call the Council of Nice, he <a id="l262"></a> wrote a threatning Letter against Arius &amp; sent it <a id="l263"></a>to all the cities: &amp; in that letter  Constantine speaks <a id="l264"></a>thus to Arius. Vnum dicis Deum: habes ejusdem me sententiæ. Sic igitur <a id="l265"></a>sentias. Ejus essentiæ Verbum &amp; pricipij et finis expers, Verbum esse dicis: eo <a id="l266"></a>contentus sum ita crede Siquid præterea adjungis, id tollo.

<p id="par29">The word ὁμοούσιος which was used by the Nicene Coun<a id="l308"></a>cil in this Creed &amp; which is here translated <em class="underline">Consubstantial</em>, was <a id="l309"></a>by the Latines improperly translated <em class="underline">unius substantiæ</em>. ffor <a id="l310"></a><em class="underline">unius substantiæ</em> may signify two things of one &amp; the same <a id="l311"></a>common substance: but the words ὁμοούσιος &amp; consubstantial <a id="l312"></a>were always taken by the  ancient Greeks &amp; Latines for <a id="l313"></a>two substances of one &amp; the same  essence nature or <a id="l314"></a>species. For Eusebius of Cæsarea writing to his Church <a id="l315"></a>in the time of this Council &amp; giving them an account of <a id="l316"></a>what passed in it concerning the faith, told them that it <a id="l317"></a>was agreed by the Council that the son's being consub<a id="l318"></a>stantial to the father signified nothing more then that <a id="l319"></a>the son of God had no similitude with the creatures <a id="l320"></a>which were made by him, but was in all respects like the <a id="l321"></a>father &amp; from no other substance then the fathers. And <a id="l322"></a>  the Nicene fathers a considerable number of them in subscribing the decrees of <a id="l323"></a>the Council wrote by way of explanation that the son <a id="l324"></a>was ὁμοιούσιος to the father. And after Constantius <a id="l325"></a>came to the throne &amp; conquered the west the  authority of the Council of Nice was alledged with <a id="l327"></a>success against the opinion of a singular substance, the <a id="l328"></a>son being  in the Acts of that Council  called ὁμοιούσιος. And in the Creed it <a id="l329"></a>self the son is said to be begotten <em class="underline">of the father, that <a id="l330"></a>is of the substance of the father</em>. He is therefore <a id="l331"></a>according to this Creed, the son of his father's sub<a id="l332"></a>stance, but certainly not the son of his own substance. <a id="l333"></a>If the ffather is the substance of the father as is <a id="l334"></a>affirmed in this Creed, the son is the substance of <a id="l335"></a>the son, &amp; this substance is the son of the fathers sub<a id="l336"></a>stance. But if the father is not the substance of <a id="l337"></a>the father, he is not a substance &amp; so can be no <a id="l338"></a>father: &amp; if the son is not the substance of the son, he is <a id="l339"></a>not a substance &amp; so can be no son. And it's further obser<a id="l340"></a>vable that the Greeks called the ffather &amp; Son two Hy<a id="l341"></a>postases, that is two substances: for the Greeks always <a id="l342"></a>took Hypostases for substances, &amp; so did the Latines <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p050r"> &lt;50r&gt; </span> till the dark ages came on &amp; Greek ceased to be under<a id="l343"></a>stood in the Latine churches.</p> 
<p id="par30" class="i0">The word ομοούσιος  had been   universally rejected in the reign of <a id="l345"></a>Constantius  because it was  a novel word &amp; to introduce it was a breach of the Apostles <a id="l346"></a>rule of holding fast the form of sound words,  because it had been rejected <a id="l347"></a>long ago by the Council of Antioch which met against Paul of Samosat &amp; <a id="l348"></a>the rejection had been quietly approved by the Churches of both east &amp; west to <a id="l349"></a>whom that Council sent their circulatory letters, &amp;  because it was <a id="l350"></a>a word not understood by the people &amp; liable to various significa<a id="l351"></a>tions.

But this explanation not being in the Creed it <a id="l364"></a>self  but lying hid in the Acts of the Council <a id="l365"></a>was no security against  misinterpretations. The Latines  in their version of the <a id="l366"></a>creed wrote <em class="underline">unius substantiæ</em>  &amp;  by this phrase  gave occasion to a great part of the west <a id="l368"></a>to turn  Monousians  <a id="l369"></a>before they knew that unius substantiæ was put for similis <a id="l370"></a>substantiæ or unius substantiæ quoad speciem &amp;  naturam . <a id="l371"></a> Sulpicius Severus speaking of the homousian faith, saith that <a id="l372"></a>the Council of Nice was accounted to have been finished by <a id="l373"></a> means of Hosius, that is by his influence over the Emperor, <a id="l374"></a> <a id="l375"></a>He influenced also the Council of Serdica &amp; therefore was a <em class="underline">Monousian &amp; th</em></p>

And they in their Creed affirmed that <em class="underline">the son was</em> <a id="l400"></a> ὁμοούσιος <em class="underline">to the father according to his Deity &amp; </em> ὁμοούσιος <em class="underline">to us <a id="l401"></a>according to his humanity</em>.   He was therefore till the days of this Council  ομοούσιος to the father in such a sense as he is ομοούσιος to us, that is by similitude of substance &amp; this sense was ratified in the churches by the authority of this Council. <a id="l405"></a> And lastly to the testimony of these three Councils we may add the testimony of the <a id="l406"></a>writers of  fourth &amp; fift &amp; some following centuries.  [as Athanasius, Hilary, Epiphanius, Basil, <a id="l407"></a>Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory Nyssen,  Ambrose, Chrysostom, <a id="l408"></a>Ierom, Augustin, Theodoret, Cyrill of Alexandria, Marius Victorinus, Anastasius Theopolitanus Iohn Damascene, Euthymius <a id="l409"></a>Zygabenus.]   ffor Curcelleius &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Cudworth have plainly shewn that  the writers of those ages (Athanasius, Hilary, Epiphanius, Basil, Greg. Naz. Gr Nys. Ambrose, Chrys. Ierom. Augustin, Theodoret, Cyrill of Al. Marius Vict. Anastasius Theop. Iohn Damsc. Euth understood the father son &amp; Holy Ghost to <a id="l411"></a>be three substances of one essence nature or species.</p>
<p id="par33">Which interpretation &amp; subscriptions being  admitted  by the Council,  cannot be complained of as <a id="l413"></a>unsincere without  reflecting upon the Council  it self, &amp;  differing from it in  opinion. If the word <a id="l415"></a>ὁμοιούσιος is no security against Arianism the word ὁμοούσιος is none <a id="l416"></a>because by the  approbation of the Council bothh the words are  <a id="l417"></a>to be understood in the same sense when applied to spirits. Ierom tells <a id="l418"></a>us that the Stoicks &amp; the Manichees &amp; the Priscillianists  reputed the <a id="l419"></a>souls of men to be parts of the  substance of God &amp; any heretick may <a id="l420"></a>with as much reason say that they are consubstantial to God</p>
<p id="par34" class="i0">And the complaint against these subscriptions as insincere  strengthens the evidence that there were such subscriptions  in the Acts of the <a id="l422"></a>Council.</p><span class="pagenumber" id="p050v"> &lt;50v&gt; </span>
<p id="par35" class="i0">And at the same time many of the Latines  understood the latine version of the Nicene Creed <a id="l424"></a>in a very different sense taking the words <em class="underline">unius substantiæ</em> to signify that <a id="l425"></a>the father &amp; son had one &amp; the same common substance.  ffor the Western Bishops in <a id="l426"></a>the Council of Serdica  condemned Vrsatius &amp; Valens for saying that there were <a id="l427"></a>three Hypostases or substances of the father son &amp; Holy Ghost &amp; in opposition to them <a id="l428"></a>affirmed that there was of all three but one Hypostasis or substance which <a id="l429"></a>the hereticks call Vsia, &amp; that the Hypostasis of the son was that <a id="l430"></a>which alone is the Hypostasis of the ffather.  And this mistake created a great <a id="l432"></a>misunderstanding between the eastern &amp; western Bishops  the eastern bishops calling those Sabellians who held but one substance &amp; the western calling those Arians who held three. But when  the Eastern Emperor Constantius conquered  Magnentius &amp;  <a id="l434"></a>extended his dominion over all the west, the authority of the Council of Nice <a id="l435"></a>was alledged with success against this opinion of a singular substance, the Acts <a id="l436"></a>of the Council being produced  in the times of the councils of Ariminum &amp; Seleucia. And by this means the bishops of the whole Empire a very few excep<a id="l438"></a>ted came into the opinion that the son was ὁμοιούσιος to the father  like the father acording to substance. <a id="l439"></a>Against the use of the word ὁμοούσιος three reasons were now alledged, as Hillary <a id="l440"></a>mentions (lib. de Synodis sub finem), 1 because that word in its most proper signification  implies a <a id="l441"></a>partition of an antecedent substance into two, 2 because the 89 Bishops which convened at <a id="l442"></a>Antioch against  Paul of Samosat 61 years before <a id="l443"></a>the Council of Nice rejected the ὁμοούσιος, 3 becaus the word was not <a id="l444"></a>in scripture  for which reason the Bishops at Ariminum &amp; Seleucia omitted also the word <a id="l445"></a>ὁμοιούσιος &amp; used only the word ὁμοίος ‡<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 50v &gt; </span> ‡ saying  in their Creed that the son was <em class="underline">like the father according <a id="l446"></a>to the scriptures</em>.  By which expression they intended to exclude <a id="l447"></a>the word  ουσία which  is not in the scriptures &amp;    <a id="l449"></a>&amp; to declare the likeness of the son  to be  such as is described in the scriptures by calling him the image of the invisible God &amp; the  express image <a id="l451"></a>of his  substance. They condemned also the language of one Hypostasis of the father son &amp; H. Ghost. And tho after the reign of Constantius the <a id="l452"></a> word ὁμοούσιος was again received yet it was not any more taken for <a id="l453"></a>a single substance till the dark ages came on. Liberius Bishop of Rome subscribed to the word ὁμοιούσιος in the reign of Constantius &amp; after his <a id="l454"></a>death returned to  use the word ὁμοούσιος but took it in the same <a id="l455"></a>sense with ὁμοιούσιος. ffor  in the reign of Valentinian &amp; Valens <a id="l456"></a>when the Macedonians came to him &amp; professed the son to be in <a id="l457"></a>all things like the father &amp; that ὁμοούσιος differed not from ὅμοιος, <a id="l458"></a>he received them [Socr. l. 4. c. 12.] And the Council which met at <a id="l459"></a>Antioch in the reign of Iovian<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from higher up f 50v resumes &gt; </span>  And <a id="l460"></a>tho after reign of Constantius the word ομοούσιος was again  received  yet <a id="l461"></a> it was not any more  taken for a  single  substance <a id="l462"></a>till the dark ages came on.</p>
<p id="par36" class="i0">Sulpicius Severus saith that the Arians       by alledging the Council of Nice for themselves clouded the truth <a id="l464"></a>having corrupted the Council by adding a letter &amp;  turning ὁμοούσιος <a id="l465"></a>to ὁμοιούσιος. But if  any such  corruption had been discovered it would not have clouded <a id="l466"></a>the truth.

<p id="par41"><span class="ns">♀</span>  Yet the Christians continued quiet till the death of Iulian, &amp; then <a id="l547"></a>Athanasius sent his faith to the Emperor Iovian in an Epistle <span class="ns">♀</span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 51v &gt; </span> <span class="ns">♀</span> And soon after   he presented  his faith to the Emperor <a id="l548"></a>Iovian  in an Epistle which concludes thus.

And this is that confession of faith  <a id="l558"></a>celebrated by Gregory Nazianzen by the authority of which the western churches &amp; some of the eastern were induced to separate and preach the truth. For  Henceforward they  began to return from the Councils <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 2 words)">{illeg}</span> &amp; Seleucia to  the Nicene faith &amp; (as Sozomen tells us) <em class="underline">they that professed the son consubstantial to the <a id="l560"></a>father, were of the same opinion concerning the Spirit.

And Athanasius wrote back that <a id="l595"></a>the son of God assumed a man &amp; that he beleived in one God the father almighty <a id="l596"></a>&amp; in his son our Lord Iesus Christ &amp; in the holy Ghost &amp; that they were of one <a id="l597"></a>unity,  one power,  one usia,  one  glory,  one <a id="l598"></a>dominion,  one image, the Trinity consubstantial. And at <a id="l599"></a>that time Athanasius convened Eusebius Vercellensis &amp; the Legate of Lucifer <a id="l600"></a>Calaritanus &amp; some other Bishops in a Council at Alexandria which Council (as Socrates (&amp; Sozomen <a id="l601"></a>tell us<sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> ) confirmed the Nicene decree, &amp; professing the holy Ghost to be consubstan<a id="l602"></a>tial to the ffather &amp; Son named them the Trinity &amp; that the man whom <a id="l603"></a>God the Word assumed had not only a body but also a soul, &amp; that the words <a id="l604"></a>usia &amp; hypostasis having created disturbance in the Church should be used no more <a id="l605"></a>with relation to the Deity unless in refuting the opinion of Sabellius  by calling every one in the Trinity God in his proper hypostasis. ffor it seems the Latines using unius substantiæ for <a id="l608"></a>consubstantial &amp; taking  the words usia &amp; hypostasis  in the same signification with  <a id="l609"></a>substantia  had contended hitherto that there was but one usia &amp; one hypostasis  in <a id="l610"></a>the Deity, &amp; the Greeks who were of the  consubstantial faith  translating substantia by usia  affirmed that <a id="l613"></a>there was one usia &amp; three hypostases,  &amp; thereupon the Greeks called the Latines Sabellians for <a id="l614"></a>holding but one Hypostasis &amp; the Latines called the Greeks Arians for holding <a id="l615"></a>three. But Athanasius  now examining  both parties  found that they agreed in their <a id="l616"></a>sense the Latines by one Vsia &amp; one Hypostasis &amp; three persons meaning one substance in nature &amp; species <a id="l617"></a>&amp; three in number &amp; the Greeks by one usia &amp; three hypostases meaning  the same thing. &amp; so he made <a id="l618"></a>them friends.</p>  <span class="pagenumber" id="p053r"> &lt;53r&gt; </span>

<p id="par48">Irenæus tells us that all heresies had their rise from Simon &amp; <a id="l656"></a>calls him the father of all the hereticks.  <a id="l657"></a>And Simon derived  all things from the conceptions or Ideas of God &amp;  the first conception of Gods mind he called Ennoea &amp; Prunicus <a id="l659"></a>&amp; a holy spirit, &amp; said that by her God conceived in his mind <a id="l660"></a> in the beginning to make Powers &amp;  Archangels &amp; Angels <a id="l661"></a>&amp; placing God &amp; Ennœa above the Spheres or heaven he    said that when she came out of him she descended  to <a id="l663"></a>the lower regions  &amp; generated Powers &amp; Angels &amp; that they cre<a id="l664"></a>ated the world. And these powers &amp; Angels he placed in the <a id="l665"></a>several heavens or Orbs where they were generated &amp; gave barbarous <a id="l666"></a>names to the powers or Æons <a id="l667"></a>&amp; said that the Angels governed the world amiss contending for <a id="l668"></a>dominion &amp; that Ennœa was very beautifull &amp; enticed the  Powers <a id="l669"></a>&amp; Angels to her embraces &amp; they used her injuriously &amp; deteined <a id="l670"></a>her below &amp;  knew not the first God. <a id="l671"></a> Whence it came to pass that the Gnosticks called him the unknown father.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p053v"> &lt;53v&gt; </span> He said also that the Angels caused her to pass into the bodies of weomen, meaning by a Pythagoric <a id="l677"></a>transmigration, &amp; that she was in Minerva &amp; in the Trojan Helena <a id="l678"></a>&amp;  in many others &amp; at length came into Helena the con<a id="l679"></a>cubine of Simon.  &amp; that the Angels passed into men &amp; beasts &amp; in the <a id="l680"></a>bodies of  men enjoyed her &amp; made war upon one another for her sake meaning at Troy He said also that she was the lost <a id="l682"></a>sheep &amp; that the  first God descended to rescue her  <a id="l683"></a>&amp; save them that acknowledged him from the tyranny of the Angels who <a id="l684"></a>deteined their souls below &amp; made them pass into various bodies, &amp; that in  descending through the orbs <a id="l685"></a>he changed his form  in every Orb into that <a id="l686"></a>of the Angels in that Orb that they might not know him &amp; among men <a id="l687"></a>appeared as a man &amp; seemed to suffer in Iudæa;  but did not really suffer. He said further that  God appeared  in Samaria on Mount Sina in <a id="l688"></a>the  person of the father, in Iudea in the person of the son &amp; in <a id="l689"></a>other nations in the person of the holy ghost,  &amp; that he himself was this God that <a id="l690"></a> God; meaning in the same sence that his concubine was <a id="l691"></a>Ennœa that is by a Pythagoric transmigration of God into a humane soul or at least by having an apparent body <a id="l692"></a>. And in the same sense his Disciple Menander said that he was  a power sent by the invisible Æons to  be the saviour of the world. ] Simon said also that weomen were to be in common &amp; that the Prophets were <a id="l693"></a>inspired by Angels his ennemies &amp; therefore  to be  rejected <a id="l694"></a>&amp; that men were to be saved (he ment from the tyranny of the Angels) not by just works but only by faith in him <a id="l695"></a>&amp; Helena &amp; therefore might do what they pleased.   And that weomen  were to be in common. Whence his Priests lived <a id="l699"></a>in lust &amp; used exorcisms &amp; incantations &amp; magical arts &amp; philtres <a id="l700"></a>&amp; things enticing weomen to lust &amp; fictions of familiar spirits &amp; of pro<a id="l701"></a>phetick dreams &amp; worshipped the images of Simon &amp;  Helena in the <a id="l702"></a>form of Iupiter &amp; Minerva; &amp; in their assemblies had filthy <a id="l703"></a>mysteries instituted by Simon which consisted in offering to their Gods <a id="l704"></a>the seminal profluvia of men &amp; menstrua of weomen instead of the <a id="l705"></a>Eucharist.    To the Ogdoas of Powers Intelligences or Æons placed by Simon &amp; his followers in the  heavens <a id="l726"></a>of the fixt stars &amp; seven Planets  some added a decas of Æons answering to the <a id="l728"></a>number of the nations which God promised to give to Abraham for a possession <a id="l729"></a>&amp; also a Dodecas of Æons answering to the twelve signes of the Zodiac &amp; twelve <a id="l730"></a>months in the year: All which made up the 30 Æons of the Valentinians answering to the number of <a id="l731"></a>days in the month &amp; of years in the age of Christ before he  <a id="l732"></a>was baptized &amp; began to act. And some  (as Basilidas) equalled the number of Æons to that of days in <a id="l733"></a>the year [And they generally held a transmigration of souls feigning with Simon that <a id="l734"></a>they came down from above &amp; after a circulation through various bodies under the tyranny the <a id="l735"></a>Angels till they had performed all things were at length <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> a Saviour set at liberty to return up again.]   Simon's making every <a id="l736"></a>soul to have  more bodies then one allowed <a id="l737"></a>no resurrection of the body but placed salvation <a id="l738"></a>in the ascent of the soul alone through <a id="l739"></a>the Orbs to their first station &amp; condition. <a id="l740"></a>And his disciples taught that the body was the prison in which the souls of men were <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l741"></a>by passing from body to body till they had paid the uttermost farthing, that is till they had done <a id="l742"></a>all things which they were to do in the body / And  denying the resurrection of the body (for he <a id="l743"></a>assigned many bodies to  the same soul) he placed salvation in the ascent of the soul alone</p><span class="pagenumber" id="p054r"> &lt;54r&gt; </span> 
<p id="par49">Epiphanius  recconing Simon to be the predecessor of Nicolaus <a id="l744"></a>conjoins the sects of the Gnosticks &amp; Nicolaitans &amp; from the Nicolaitans derives <a id="l745"></a>the various sects of the Gnosticks called Gnosticks, Phibionites, ffollowers of Epi<a id="l746"></a>phanes Militaries Barbelites Sethians Cainites Ophites &amp; by other names, &amp; so far as I <a id="l747"></a>can find they held much the same doctrines with Simon. His Ennœa they called Prunicus &amp; Barbelo or Barbero,   <a id="l748"></a>&amp; placed her in the eight heaven &amp; seven Intelligences or Æons in  <a id="l749"></a>the seven heavens under her, calling the first or highest of them Ialdabacth <a id="l750"></a>&amp; Νους &amp; said also with Simon that  Barbelo  was beautiful &amp; <a id="l751"></a> enticed the  other powers to her embraces &amp; that Ialdabacth was <a id="l752"></a>her son &amp; made the heaven &amp; earth. They called her Prunicus to signify her lust.  They said also that souls destitute <a id="l753"></a>of the knowledge were cast down from above &amp; transfused into the bodies of <a id="l754"></a> hoggs &amp; other animals but by  science &amp; the practise of their sect the soul <a id="l755"></a>might be set at liberty to return up &amp; pass by the Princes to the highest heaven. And this <a id="l756"></a>they called the saving of the soul. They indulged carnal pleasures &amp; <a id="l757"></a>after the example of Nicolas quitted their wives leaving them to the <a id="l758"></a>embraces of other men, &amp; bidding them be charitable to the brethren. <a id="l759"></a>And after adultery they offered the  filthy sacrifice  instituted by Simon saying <a id="l760"></a>this is my body &amp; this is my blood.<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup>  And some of them (as the Phibionites) not content with <a id="l761"></a>an Odoas of Æons encreased them to the number of days in the  year. <a id="l762"></a>Thus far therefore They seem  to have been Gnosticks of the same kind with Simon &amp; his followers.   But  in their opinions about Iesus Christ <a id="l777"></a>they differed</p>

<p id="par51">For the Simonian Gnosticks said that Iesus Christ was a putative man &amp; had <a id="l778"></a>only an apparent body, the Nicolaitans  said with the Ebionites Iesus was a true man  visible palpable <a id="l780"></a>&amp; passible like other men, but Christ was an impassible spirit or vertue from above, &amp; that Christ <a id="l781"></a>descended upon Iesus &amp; composed Iesus Christ, &amp; did the miraculous works. For <a id="l782"></a>Irenæus tells us<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup>  that Cerinthus &amp; long before him the Nicolaitans, a <a id="l783"></a>branch of the Gnosticks,  taught that the maker of the world was <a id="l784"></a>one &amp; the father of our Lord was another, the son of the fabricator was one <a id="l785"></a>&amp; Christ from above was another who being impassible descended upon Iesus in <a id="l786"></a>the form of a Dove &amp; when Iesus was led to Pilate flew back to his pleroma (or Ogdoas of Æons) &amp; that <a id="l787"></a>Απχὴ was the only begotten &amp; Λόγος the son of the only begotten &amp; our world <a id="l788"></a>was made not by the first God but by a power very inferior &amp; cut off from <a id="l789"></a>the communication of those [seven Æons] who are invisible &amp; innominable; &amp; that <a id="l790"></a>for abolishing these heresies Iohn wrote in his Gospel that there was one God <a id="l791"></a>who made all things by Iesus Christ.<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup>   And <a id="l792"></a>the Sethians &amp; Ophites  sects of the Nicolaitans, said that Iesus was a true man born of <a id="l793"></a>the Virgin Mary by the power of  God &amp; that Christ (the son of <a id="l794"></a>God &amp;   the first female  in conjunction with his sister Sophia descended upon Iesus &amp; composed Iesus <a id="l795"></a>Christ &amp; that the souls of Iohn the Baptist &amp; Iesus descended from above For <a id="l796"></a>the transmigration of souls was the common opinion of the Gnosticks. The Nicolaitans <a id="l797"></a>therefore taught that the soul of Iesus descended from above &amp; that he was <a id="l798"></a>a true man born either of Ioseph &amp; Mary as was the doctrine of the <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Phibionites<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; Cerinthus <a id="l799"></a>or of  Mary alone by the power of God as was the doctrine of the Sethians &amp; <a id="l800"></a>Ophites, &amp; that  a superior vertue whom they called Christ descended upon <a id="l801"></a>him at his baptism &amp; composed Iesus Christ &amp; revealed the unknown father &amp; did <a id="l802"></a>the supernatural works &amp;  when  Iesus was led to Pilate departed <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p054v"> &lt;54v&gt; </span> from him &amp; flew up to his Pleroma, &amp; Iesus alone suffered on the cross crying <a id="l803"></a>out My God My God why hast thou forsaken me.

And Secundus seems to have followed Valentinus in this opinion.

<p id="par55">The Church of Rome began to decay in vertue before the <a id="l872"></a>end of the second Century, &amp; to lay the stress of religion upon <a id="l873"></a>  ceremonies  &amp; outward forms <a id="l874"></a>as is manifest by Victor's making so great a dust against the <a id="l875"></a>Churches of Asia Syria Mesopotamia &amp; Iudæa for keeping Eas<a id="l876"></a>ter upon the 14<sup>th</sup> day of the Moon &amp; threatning to excom<a id="l877"></a>municate them for it.  Whether they should commemorate <a id="l878"></a>the resurrection on that day as they had done from the beginning <a id="l879"></a>or  neglect the commemoration thereof till the  Lords day following as the Latines Africans &amp; Egyptians <a id="l880"></a>had done from the beginning was a thing indifferent  in its own nature &amp; Victor could not judge the eastern nations for their practise without usurping the <a id="l882"></a>authority of universal bishop.</p>
<p id="par56">The same thing is further manifest by the growth of  <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>the Ca<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>taphrygian heresy in the Church of Rome in the end of that century: <a id="l884"></a>a religion full of superstition. For the contagion of this <a id="l885"></a>heresy spread it self so as to reach the Bishop of Rome him<a id="l886"></a>self &amp; incline him to write pacificatory letters to the Cataphry<a id="l887"></a>gians in Asia. Which he had done had not Praxeas  the <a id="l888"></a>author of another heresy  prevented it by con<a id="l889"></a>verting the Bishop of Rome from the Cataphrygian to the Praxean <a id="l890"></a> party, as Tertullian  a Montanist or Cataphrygian  in his book against Praxeas  mentions in these words, <a id="l891"></a>Nam idem [Praxeas] tunc Episcopum Romanum  agnoscentem <a id="l892"></a>jam prophetias Montani Priscæ et Maximillæ &amp; ex ea ag<a id="l893"></a>nitione pacem Ecclesijs Asiæ &amp; Phrygiæ inferentem, falsa <a id="l894"></a>de ipsis Prophetis et Ecclesijs eorum adservando, &amp; præces<a id="l895"></a>sorum ejus authoritates defendendo, coegit  et literas <a id="l896"></a>pacis revocare jam emissas, &amp; a proposito recipendorum <a id="l897"></a>charismatum concessare. Ita duo negotia diaboli Praxeas <a id="l898"></a>Romæ procuravit, prophetiam expulit &amp; hæresin intulit; <a id="l899"></a>Paracletum fugavit &amp;  Patrem crucifixit. Praxeas maintained <a id="l900"></a>that there was one single substance of the father son &amp; holy Ghost <a id="l901"></a> called by three <a id="l902"></a>names  as Sabellius did afterwards &amp; therefore Tertullian reccons him a Patri<a id="l903"></a>passian saying Patrem crucifixit.   <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p056r"> &lt;56r&gt; </span>  <a id="l920"></a>By these doctrines it appears that the Cataphrygians were Gnosticks <a id="l921"></a>ffor  Simon Magus &amp; his successors derived all <a id="l922"></a>things from one first being  by emission  of substance. <a id="l923"></a>Simon &amp; Menander called the first emitted substance Ennoia &amp; the next Angels <a id="l924"></a>Basilides called  the first emission Νους &amp; said that Νους was Christ  <a id="l925"></a>&amp; from Νους derived  a series of other emissions the <a id="l926"></a>last of which was Angels. Valentinus Secundus &amp; Tatian  called <a id="l927"></a> such emissions Æons.   Simon <a id="l929"></a>pretended that Ennoia was seized by Angels &amp; shut up in <a id="l930"></a>the body of a woman &amp; according to the Doctrine of the <a id="l931"></a>transmigration of Souls  passed from woman to <a id="l932"></a>woman   &amp; in the time of the Trojan war was in Helena, &amp; that <a id="l933"></a>he himself was the first God &amp; (I suppose according to the <a id="l934"></a>same doctrine of transmigration) appeared in Samaria as <a id="l935"></a>the  Son, In Iudæa as the father &amp; in other nations <a id="l936"></a>as the Holy Ghost. Montanus  made the son &amp; holy Ghost <a id="l937"></a>emissions from the ffather &amp; subordinate to him.  And <a id="l938"></a>(if I mistake not) Cerinthus was of the same opinion. <a id="l939"></a>Saturninus or Saturnilis taught that  when the Angels  <a id="l940"></a>who made the world had formed a man they were not <a id="l941"></a>able to give him life,  but the virtue from above emitted <a id="l942"></a>a spark of life which made the man live &amp; which after death should <a id="l943"></a>return to those things which are of the same nature with it self. <a id="l944"></a>The Montanists that Man was not only made by a rational <a id="l945"></a>author (viz<sup>t</sup> the Deity) but animated ex substantia ejus <a id="l946"></a>The Manichees  Priscilianists &amp; <a id="l947"></a>Stoicks (as Ierome tells us) that the souls of men were <a id="l948"></a>particles of the substance of God. Of which opinion were also <a id="l949"></a>the ancient Egyptians &amp; the Brachmans.  ffor they <a id="l950"></a>make all things proceed from the substance of God &amp; return <a id="l951"></a>into it. And in the same sense I understand Epiphanius where he tells us that Valentinus &amp; Colorbasus &amp; all the Gnosticks &amp; Manichees made certain traductions of souls &amp; transmigrations into various bodies. Saturninus, Marcion,  &amp; Tatian condem<a id="l952"></a>ned marriage &amp; the eating of   the flesh of animals. <a id="l953"></a>&amp; Montanus taught to abstein from marriage &amp; from some sorts <a id="l954"></a>of Meat.</p>

<p id="par58" class="i0">Simon magus feigned that  he was the great God  &amp; that  his woman Helena or Selena  resulted <a id="l961"></a>from him &amp; was the first conception of his mind, &amp;  called Ennoia the mother of <a id="l962"></a>all things: ffor of her he conceived Angels &amp; Archangels  &amp; powers by whom the world was made; &amp; that Ennoia  was deteined <a id="l964"></a>&amp; used opprobriously by  these Angels &amp; powers  which had been emitted from her &amp; was shut up in a humane <a id="l966"></a>body &amp; according to the doctrine of the transmigration of souls <a id="l967"></a>passed from body to body, being  formerly in the Trojan Helena <a id="l968"></a>&amp; that he   also came among men in the form of a man tho he was not a man, &amp; appeared <a id="l969"></a>in Iudæa as the son in Samaria as the ffather &amp; in other <a id="l970"></a>nations as the holy Ghost passing from body to body.  His successor <a id="l971"></a>Menander feigned in like manner that the world was made by <a id="l972"></a>Angels who were emitted from Ennoia.  &amp; that the first vertue was unknown to all &amp; sent him down for the salvation of men. And Saturninus or Saturnilus  <a id="l973"></a>like Menander feigned that there was one father unknown to <a id="l974"></a>all who made the Angels Archangels &amp; powers &amp; that the <a id="l975"></a>Angels made the world &amp; when they had made a man but <a id="l976"></a>were not able to give him life &amp; motion, the Vertue from <a id="l977"></a>above emitted a spark of life which made  the man live &amp; which <a id="l978"></a>after death returns to those things which are of the same <a id="l979"></a>nature with it self. And other things rexolved into what they were <a id="l980"></a>made of.

This reason was alledged by the Councils of  Sirmium, Nice Ariminum Seleucia &amp; Const &amp; is the stronger because <a id="l992"></a> we are commanded by the  Apostle to hold fast the form of sound words <a id="l993"></a> For  to contend for any <a id="l994"></a>language which was not handed down from the Prophets  &amp; Apostles  is a breach <a id="l995"></a>of this divine command, &amp; they that  transgress this command are guilty of the disturbances &amp; <a id="l996"></a>schisms occasioned thereby.  And   therefore the said Councils did well  in making the scripture their rule &amp;  <a id="l997"></a>contenting themselves with saying that <em class="underline">the son was like the father according to <a id="l998"></a>scripture</em>. If it be said that they were Arians I doubt not but there were Arians <a id="l999"></a>amongst them, as there were Sabellians &amp; Montanists amongst the western Churches <a id="l1000"></a>but I am speaking of the visible Church whose being &amp; extent is measured <a id="l1001"></a> not by the private opinions  of men  but by their out<a id="l1002"></a>ward profession of faith.  What men were in their hearts God only <a id="l1003"></a>knows: we can only judge of Churches &amp; Councils by their outward professions <a id="l1004"></a>of faith, &amp; in the professions  published by these <a id="l1005"></a>Councils I meet with nothing Arian. Nor do I find in history that they were <a id="l1006"></a>called Arians for any thing else then abrogating the language of the ancient <a id="l1007"></a>hereticks  adhering to scripture &amp; holding fast the form of sound words</p>

<p id="par93" class="i0">– the Popes Silvester &amp; Iulius supported the Cæcilianists against the sentence of a Council of the <a id="l1265"></a>African Churches, Pope Zozimus received the appeal of Apianus against the sentence <a id="l1266"></a>of some bishops in Afric, &amp; Pope Iulius received the appeals of several persons <a id="l1267"></a>from the Councils of the Greeks.

<p id="par95">The Controversy about the universal bishoprick being thus  composed <a id="l1269"></a>the  bishops set themselves in the next place to  <a id="l1270"></a>compose the disputes which had arisen about the faith. They had in <a id="l1271"></a>the Council of Nice &amp; in the Councils of Antioch, Philipopolis, &amp; Sir<a id="l1272"></a>mium rejected the novel language of Arius with an anathema &amp; <a id="l1273"></a>now they  agreed in the 2<sup>d</sup> &amp; third Council of Sirmium &amp; in those of Nice in <a id="l1274"></a>Thrace Ariminum Seleucia &amp; Constantinople  A.C. 357, <a id="l1275"></a>358, 359 &amp;360 to reject the novel language of Alexander Constantine <a id="l1276"></a>Hosius &amp; Athanasius,namely the words ὀυσία substance ὁμοούσιος &amp; ὁμοιούσιος,  <a id="l1277"></a> as not in scripture nor received by tradition <a id="l1278"></a> nor understood by the people but condemned in  Paul of Samosat by the Council of Antioch  with the <a id="l1279"></a>approbation of the Church catholick above 50 years before the meeting <a id="l1280"></a>of the Council of Nice, &amp; condemned also by the Apostles, who command us <a id="l1281"></a>to hold fast the form of sound words which we have received, &amp; to contend for <a id="l1282"></a>the faith which was once delivered to the saints. [They rejected therefore the <a id="l1283"></a>novel expressions of both parties  as not necessary to salvation not belonging to the primitive rule of faith, but tending to strife &amp; faction  &amp; schism &amp; therefore not to be imposed without the  crime of uncharitableness. And instead <a id="l1285"></a>of  imposing those novel expressions they contented themselves with this <a id="l1286"></a>profesion of faith  that the son is like the father according to scriptures, <a id="l1287"></a>making the scriptures the rule of faith. And hitherto the visible Church catholick <a id="l1288"></a>of Christ represented by the seven Churches of Asia,  prevailed &amp; from the days of the Apostles continued united &amp; constantly diffused through the whole Roman Empire. </p>
<p id="par96">But now the schism was at hand which proved its ruin.]</p>
<p id="par97" class="i0">Whether  the  sentences &amp; opinions imposed were true or fals was not the question but whether they were <a id="l1290"></a>fundamental truths, &amp; delivered in the language of the Apostles, such truths as the Apostle calls milk for babes, such <a id="l1291"></a>truths as a man must beleive before baptism, such truths as  were  always in the Creed &amp; were conditions of communion from the beginning. If they were <a id="l1293"></a> not such truths, to  impose them as fundamental was to create distur<a id="l1294"></a>bances factions &amp; schisms, &amp;  make the imposers guilty of all the mischiefs which <a id="l1295"></a>followed thereupon.  <a id="l1296"></a>Wo  unto the world saith Christ because of offences, for it must needs be that offences come: but wo <a id="l1297"></a>to that man by whom the offence cometh. Mat. 18.7.  And  Now I beseech you, brethren  saith the Apostle mark them who cause divisions &amp; offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye <a id="l1299"></a>have learned,  &amp; avoid them. For they that are such, serve <a id="l1300"></a>not our Lord Iesus Christ but their own belly, &amp; by good words &amp; fair speeches deceive the hearts <a id="l1301"></a>of the simple. Rom. 16.17 And again: tho we or an Angel from heaven preach any other gospel <a id="l1302"></a>unto you, then that which ye have received, let him be  anathema. As we said before, so <a id="l1303"></a>say I now again,  If any  man preach any other gospel unto you then <a id="l1304"></a>that which  we have preached, let him be  anathema. Gal. 1.8. Circumcision <a id="l1305"></a>was lawful to the Iews but not imposed on the Gentiles, &amp; as the imposing it on them is here called <a id="l1306"></a>another Gospel so  the imposing of any  truth  which was not imposed from the begin<a id="l1307"></a>ning of the Gospel is  another Gospel &amp; by the Apostles rule deserves an anathema. It is <a id="l1308"></a>giving offence to weak brethren &amp; wo be to that man through whom offences come. It <a id="l1309"></a>tends to discord &amp; schism &amp; therefore proceeds from  a spirit of uncharitablness, &amp; charity is a <a id="l1310"></a>greater grace then faith, &amp; more necessary to salvation,  &amp; schisms <a id="l1311"></a>are more damnable then infidelity. For its better not to have known the Lord then <a id="l1312"></a>to set the members of his mystical body at variance amongst themselves. The bishops <a id="l1313"></a>therefore rejected the novel language of both parties as not necessary to salvation, not <a id="l1314"></a>belonging to the primitive Rule of faith, not consisting with the indispensible rule of charity but <a id="l1315"></a>tending to strife &amp; faction &amp; schism.

<p id="par99">About 59 years after the schism of Novatian  began there was another <a id="l1318"></a>schism  made between the Donatists &amp; the Cicilianists in Afric.

<p id="par102">Hitherto the  Churches of the Greeks &amp; Latines had continued <a id="l1337"></a>united in external communion throughout the whole Roman Empire <a id="l1338"></a>(except the short schisms made by  Victor &amp; Stephen) but now they inclined to a separation. ffor the western bishops  <a id="l1339"></a>at Serdica excommunicated seven or eight of the eastern bishops &amp; <a id="l1340"></a>the eastern bishops at Philippolis excommunicated  Iulius bishop <a id="l1341"></a>of Rome &amp; Hosius bishop of Corduba &amp;  three or  four others of the western bishops <a id="l1342"></a>for  receiving &amp; supporting excommunicated persons against the lawful authority of the Councils which excommunicated them &amp; the western at Serdica excommunicated seven <a id="l1343"></a>or eight eastern bishops by name  for not submitting to the judgement of the western &amp; <a id="l1344"></a>upon other various pretenses. But while  a few bishops <a id="l1345"></a>of each party were excommunicated by the other party it is <a id="l1346"></a>manifest that  both parties looked upon  <a id="l1347"></a> themselves as hitherto in communion  in communion with one <a id="l1349"></a>another. &amp; that they still continued in communion. And this further   is <a id="l1350"></a>further confirmed by the eastern Council of Sirmium which about <a id="l1351"></a>four years after viz<sup>t</sup> A.C. 351, condemned Photinus &amp; whose <a id="l1352"></a>sentence was generally  approved in the west as well <a id="l1353"></a>as in the east both then &amp;  afterwards.</p>

<p id="par104"> And now Constantius conquering Magnentius the western Emperor  united the whole Empire under himself  put a stop to the growing discord &amp; A.C. 355 for reconciling the contending parties, called a council of above <a id="l1356"></a>300 bishops at Millain to subscribe the condemnation of Atha<a id="l1357"></a>nasius. The western Bishops defended not Athanasius <a id="l1358"></a>but offered to subscribe if the Nicene faith might be first <a id="l1359"></a>confirmed: but they were made to understand that nothing could be <a id="l1360"></a>regularly debated or proceed in Councils till they quitted the <a id="l1361"></a>communion of persons excommunicated. Whereupon they all <a id="l1362"></a>subscribed except Paulinus Trevirensis, Eusebius Vercellensis, <a id="l1363"></a>Dionysius . . . . . . . . . . over her own members.</p>
<p id="par105">And now the Greek &amp; Latin Churches being  equalled in authority <a id="l1364"></a>they agreed in the Councils of Sirmium Nice in Thrace Ariminum <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p061v"> &lt;61v&gt; </span> Seleucia &amp; Constantinople A.C. 357, 358, 359 &amp; 360 to lay aside the <a id="l1365"></a>new languge of ὀυσία ὅμοούσιος &amp; ὁμοιούσιος  <a id="l1366"></a>&amp; content themselves with the profession of faith that the son <a id="l1367"></a>was like the father according to the scriptures, making the <a id="l1368"></a>scriptures the rule of faith.</p>
<p id="par106">Hitherto the Greek &amp; Latine Churches continued united <a id="l1369"></a>in  one Church catholick from the days of the Apostles <a id="l1370"></a>without interruption or schism excepting two or three short <a id="l1371"></a>contentions one in the days of Pope Victor a second in the days of Pope Stephen, &amp; a third in the days of Pope Iulius: all of <a id="l1372"></a>them occasioned by these Popes. The first &amp; second amounted to a <a id="l1373"></a>schism between some of the churches, but was   very  quickly healed: the third  tended to a schism but after a dispute of four or five <a id="l1375"></a>years, it  ceased by the conquest of the western empire. <a id="l1376"></a>&amp; in this united state the Church continued till the death of  <a id="l1377"></a>the Emperors Iulian &amp; Iovian A.C. 363. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the left margin &gt; </span>For if  any schism had at any time happened, such as was that early one between the members of the Church of Corinth, that between Victor &amp; the <a id="l1378"></a>Churches of Asia &amp; Phrygia, &amp; that between  Stephen &amp; the Churches of Afric &amp; Asia, it was but  partial &amp; of short <a id="l1379"></a>continuance; &amp; the tendency to a schism beteen the eastern &amp; western Churches in the times  next after the Council of Serdica  <a id="l1380"></a>lasted but  four or five years.  The bishops of the Council of Nice were on all hands acknowledged in communion with the Church <a id="l1381"></a>catholick of Christ &amp; in this communion the Greek &amp; Latine Churches continued till the reign of the Emperor Iovian.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 61v resumes &gt; </span> I speak of the external <a id="l1382"></a>visible Church united in language. ffor God alone knows the hearts of men. The Greek <a id="l1383"></a>Church exploded &amp; anathematized the novel language of Arius in  <a id="l1384"></a>their Councels  &amp; published several Proffessions <a id="l1385"></a>of their faith all which were free from Arianism &amp; therefore it was not <a id="l1386"></a>Arian though it might have Arians in its communion, &amp; the <a id="l1387"></a>Latin Church declared against Sabellianism &amp; therefore was not Sa<a id="l1388"></a>bellian although it might have Sabellians in its communion. Both <a id="l1389"></a>Churches being united in language &amp; communion were but one  Church <a id="l1390"></a>&amp; this Church  together with all forreign Churches in her communion <a id="l1391"></a>was the visible Church catholick of Christ. And they that were excom<a id="l1392"></a>municated by  her (whether justly or unjustly,)  while they <a id="l1393"></a>stood excommunicated by her were out of the communion of the visible <a id="l1394"></a>Church catholick of Christ, &amp; those that separated from her were <a id="l1395"></a>Schismaticks. For the Greek Church never made a Schism &amp; therefore <a id="l1396"></a>continued  in communion of the visible Church catholick of <a id="l1397"></a>Christ. The  Church  of Rome made two or three short <a id="l1398"></a>schisms, but quickly returned into communion with the other Churches,  <a id="l1399"></a>&amp; therefore was also a branch of the visible Church catholick of Christ. <a id="l1400"></a>To call either of them schismatical  is to call the whole <a id="l1401"></a>schismatical because they were but one. And if they were not schis<a id="l1402"></a>matical they were in communion with the visible Church catholick of <a id="l1403"></a>Christ, &amp; those out of their communion were no members of the visible <a id="l1404"></a>Church.</p>
<p id="par107"> Now after the death of Iulian &amp; Iovian  Liberius Bishop of Rome <a id="l1405"></a>for gaining the universal Bishopric separated from the communion of this Church pretending it was <a id="l1406"></a>Arian, &amp; in a few years made a general defection in the west <a id="l1407"></a> the western Emperor Valentinian leaving the <a id="l1408"></a>Bishops to their liberty while the eastern Emperor Valens opposed <a id="l1409"></a>the like defection in the east. And after the death of Valens which happened A.C. 378 the <a id="l1410"></a> eastern Empire coming into the hands of Gratian &amp; Theod <a id="l1411"></a>they delivered the churches of that  Empire  into the hands of <a id="l1412"></a>those in communion with the Bishop of Rome &amp; thereby propagated <a id="l1413"></a>the Roman Catholick religion into all the Empire. And the Emperor <a id="l1414"></a>Gratian by an Edict A.C. 378 granted appeals to the Bishop of Rome <a id="l1415"></a>from the churches of Spain &amp; Gallia, thereby making him universal bishop <a id="l1416"></a>over the west. And this Bishop about seven years after  by ver<a id="l1417"></a>tue of this new authority, began to give laws to the Churches of the western empire by <a id="l1418"></a>decretal Epistles, the first epistle of this kind being written by Pope <a id="l1419"></a><span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Scricius<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> A.C. 385.</p>

<p id="par108">The christian religion at the first preaching of the gospel <a id="l1423"></a>was propagated into all the Roman Empire &amp; some other neighbour<a id="l1424"></a>ing nations as <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> Germany,  Scythia,  Dacia, Sar<a id="l1425"></a>matia, Arabia Ethiopia, &amp; the churches throughout all the Em<a id="l1426"></a>pire continued in communion with one another till the <a id="l1427"></a>reign of the Emperors Valentinian &amp; Valens, in whose days the <a id="l1428"></a>church of Rome separated. In the reign of Constantius, the bishop <a id="l1429"></a>of Rome laboured very hard to make himself universal bishop &amp; for <a id="l1430"></a>that end received appeals from the  Councils of the Greek Church <a id="l1431"></a>absolved from excommunication those whom  the Councils had excom<a id="l1432"></a>municated &amp; summoned the bishops of the Greek church to appear <a id="l1433"></a>before him in a Council at Rome.  &amp; give an account of their <a id="l1434"></a>proceedings against the persons whom they had excommunicated.  &amp; to put a good colour upon the designe, it was <a id="l1437"></a>whispered in the west that the bishops of the Greek Church were <a id="l1438"></a>Arians &amp; had excommunicated the persons appealing out of malice <a id="l1439"></a>because they were orthodox. But the Greek bishops instead of com<a id="l1440"></a>ing to Rome, wrote a sharp letter to the bishop of Rome repri<a id="l1441"></a>manding him very roundly for his irregular &amp; ambitious practises. These things <a id="l1442"></a>were done A.C. 341 &amp; 342, &amp; about five years after, a Council <a id="l1443"></a>was called at Serdica by the consent of both Emperors for <a id="l1444"></a>examining the matter.</p>

In another of Tertullians it is <a id="l1448"></a>thus inserted  into the body of the Creed <em class="underline">&amp;</em> <em class="underline">shall come to judge the quick <a id="l1449"></a>&amp; the dead by the resurrection of the  flesh</em>. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the right margin &gt; </span>The resurrection of the dead was exprest in the primitive Creed by the resurrection of Christ from the dead &amp; his coming to judge the quick &amp; dead.

<p id="par113">Novatian . . . . . . . mentioned by Cyprian.</p>
<p id="par114">Alexander of Alexandria in a letter to Alexander of Byzantium <a id="l1461"></a>sent an explication of  these articles of  faith. I beleive <a id="l1462"></a>in God —</p>

<p id="par116">As the Council of Nice interpoled the Creed of Eusebius with the new article <a id="l1467"></a>of consubstantial to the father, so Athanasius a few years after interpoled the Nicene Creed with <a id="l1468"></a>several other new articles  in the manner following – – – –</p>
<p id="par117" class="i0">This Creed was later printed out of the MSS one in the Vatican &amp; another in the King of France's library, &amp; I take it to be that which Athanasius presented to Pope Iulius A.C. 341 &amp; after<a id="l1469"></a>wards to the Councils of Rome  &amp; Serdica  when they examined him about his <a id="l1470"></a>faith &amp; received him into communion  For in this Creed the words ουσία &amp; υπωστασις are taken in one &amp; the same sense &amp;  therefore this Creed was made by Athanasius while the language of one usia &amp; one hypostasis was in use  amongst his party, &amp; by consequence before  Athanasius &amp; the Council of Alexandria in the reign of Iulian the Apostate abolished the use of that language for avoiding the imputation of Sabellianism.</p>
<p id="par118">The four last Articles  of this Creed  are found also in the end <a id="l1475"></a>of the Creed of Ierusalem in these words, <em class="underline">&amp; in one baptism for the <a id="l1476"></a>remission of sins, in one holy catholic church &amp; in the resurrection <a id="l1477"></a>of the flesh &amp; in life everlasting.</em></p>
<p id="par119">They are found also in the end of the Creed  in the Apostolic constitutions in these words;  <em class="underline">who <a id="l1479"></a>beleive in the holy catholick Church, in the resurrection of the flesh, <a id="l1480"></a>in the forgiveness of sins, in the kingdom of heaven &amp; in the life of the <a id="l1481"></a>world to come</em>.</p>
<p id="par120">They were also added by the Council of Constantinople to the end <a id="l1482"></a>of the Nicene Creed in these words <em class="underline">And I beleive one Catholick &amp; Apos<a id="l1483"></a>tolick Church, I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins, &amp; I look <a id="l1484"></a>for the resurrection of the dead &amp; the life of the world to come</em>.</p>
<p id="par121">And while the Greeks of the party of Athanasius added them out of his <a id="l1485"></a>Creed into theirs, the Latines added them to theirs, &amp; the eastern Churches also for the <a id="l1486"></a>satisfaction of the Latines added them to one or two of theirs.

And the <a id="l1489"></a>eastern bishops who came to the council of Serdica A.C. 347, in reciting the <a id="l1490"></a>Creed which the Council of Antioch had published A.C. 342 &amp; 345, added to the end of <a id="l1491"></a>it these articles, <em class="underline">And we beleive in the holy Church, in the remission of sins, in the <a id="l1492"></a>resurrection of the flesh &amp; in life everlasting</em>. But four years after, in condemning Photinus, the Greek Council of Sirmium omitted them again as not belonging to this their Creed. And the following Councils of Sirmium A.C. 357 &amp; 359 of Nice in Thrace  of Ariminum &amp; Seleucia A.C. 359 &amp; Constantinople A.C. 360 continued to omit them in their Creeds. But after the year 381 the Homousians spread them  over all the east.</p>
<p id="par122">The addition of these articles to Creeds which wanted them before shews <a id="l1493"></a>plainly that they are additional articles &amp; crept into the Creeds of both Greeks &amp; Latines in the fourth <a id="l1494"></a>Century  by the authority of Athanasius &amp; the bishop of Rome &amp; by the Councils of Rome Serdica &amp; Constantinople. In <a id="l1495"></a>the third century  &amp; beginning of the 4<sup>th</sup> they  began to get into the Creeds of the Africans <a id="l1496"></a>&amp; Egyptians &amp; from thence in the middle of the 4<sup>th</sup> they got into the Creeds of Europe &amp; Asia being propagated from Egypt by Alexander &amp; Athanasius  into the Churches of the homousians &amp; by the homousians (after the year 381) into all the Empire.</p>  <span class="pagenumber" id="p063r"> &lt;63r&gt; </span>

And the Council of Constantinople called the second General council A.C. 381 added the same articles to the Nicene Creed in these words I beleive one Catholick &amp; Apostolick Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. And I look for the resurrection of the dead &amp; the life of the world to come.</p>
<p id="par124"> And about the same time or soon after <a id="l1528"></a>the Latines added the like articles to the end of their Creeds.

<p id="par125">Afterwards the Council of Antioch A.C. 341 added to the end of the Creed of Lucian <a id="l1533"></a>the resurrection of the flesh &amp; the life everlasting, in these words, <em class="underline">And if this <a id="l1534"></a>is to be added: we beleive the resurrection of the flesh &amp; the life everlasting.</em> <a id="l1535"></a>They seem to have grownded this addition upon the Apostles words who in speaking <a id="l1536"></a>of  fundamentals names  them in this order, <em class="underline">repentance from dead works, <a id="l1537"></a>&amp;  faith towards God, the doctrine of baptisms &amp; of laying on of hands &amp; of the resurrection <a id="l1538"></a>of the dead &amp; of eternal judgment</em>.  Heb. 6.1. For from this text &amp; that of <a id="l1540"></a>Eph. 4.5 they began now to add also <em class="underline">one baptism</em> to the end of the Creed. <a id="l1541"></a>as I gather from the Creed of Ierusalem recited by Cyril about tenn years <a id="l1542"></a>after this Council of Antioch, in the end of which Creed are these four articles. <a id="l1543"></a><em class="underline">and I beleive in one baptism of repentance for the remission of sins &amp; in <a id="l1544"></a>one holy Catholick Church &amp; in the resurrection of the flesh &amp; in life <a id="l1545"></a>everlasting.</em> And the Council of Constantinople  called the second gene<a id="l1546"></a>ral Council, A.C. 381, added the same articles to the Nicene Creed in these words <a id="l1547"></a><em class="underline">I beleive one Catholic &amp; Apostolic Church.

And while the Greeks added these articles to the end of their <a id="l1550"></a>creeds the Latines added them to the end of theirs. [For I do not find any of these <a id="l1551"></a>articles in that long profession of faith which the Latines published at Serdica A.C. 347 in  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 62v &gt; </span> their general epistle recited by Theodoret (l. 1. c <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) or which at least was attributed <a id="l1552"></a>to them in the end of the reign of the Emperor Constantius &amp; therefore they were <a id="l1553"></a>added by the Latines since the days of that Council.]<br><br></p>
<p id="par126">And the same articles  are at the end of a Creed composed by Atha<a id="l1554"></a>nasius about the same time &amp; lately published out of a MS found in the <a id="l1555"></a>Vatican.  The words  in the end of this Creed are: <em class="underline">And we beleive <a id="l1556"></a>in one only Catholick &amp; Apostolick Church, in one baptism of repen<a id="l1557"></a>tance &amp; of remission of sins, in the resurrection of the dead, in æternal <a id="l1558"></a>judgment of souls &amp; bodies, in the kingdom of heaven &amp; life ever<a id="l1559"></a>lasting</em>. Here the article of eternal judgment is plainly taken from the  abovementioned words of the Apostle.   And Athanasius being the great oracle of those days its probable that from this his Creed the four articles  above mentioned were added to the Creed of Ieru<a id="l1562"></a>salem recited by Cyrill. They were added also to the Nicene Creed by the <a id="l1563"></a>general Council of Constantinople  A.C. 381 in these words <em class="underline">I beleive one <a id="l1564"></a>catholick &amp; Apostolick Church, I acknowledge one baptism for the remission <a id="l1565"></a>of sins, I look for the resurrection of the dead &amp; the life of the world <a id="l1566"></a>to come</em>. And  since these articles were added to old Creeds that wanted them <a id="l1567"></a>its plain that they were new ones. They are also at the end of the Creed <a id="l1568"></a>in the Apostolic constitutions.

<p id="par130">The article descended into Hell is not found in any Creed till after the <a id="l1589"></a>middle of the fourth Century.

<p id="par131">Novatianus  in the end of the persecution of Decius A.C.  351   making a schism in the Roman Church &amp; denying remission of sins to them who  lapsed <a id="l1608"></a>after baptism  was condemned for it <a id="l1609"></a>by the Councils at Rome Carthage &amp; Antioch.

For Cypri<a id="l1612"></a>an in his 76<sup>th</sup> Epistle  contending that the Novatians <a id="l1613"></a>had no baptism, argues thus.

<p id="par132" class="i0">bishops of the Church catholick in the very beginning of <a id="l1627"></a>the controversy with Arius &amp; subscribed by all those of <a id="l1628"></a>his party writes thus Quod si ffilius ratio Patris est ac <a id="l1629"></a>sapientia: quomodo fuit tempus cum non esset?

This being subscribed by all the Bishops of <a id="l1633"></a>his party may be taken for their common. And <a id="l1634"></a>Constantine the great published the same opinion even before <a id="l1635"></a>he convened the Council of Nice. For in an epistle which he then <a id="l1636"></a>sent to the Church of Alexandria &amp; which was <a id="l1637"></a> published in all the cities of the Roman Empire, he <a id="l1638"></a>spake thus to Arius: Vnum dicis Deum: habes ejusdem me <a id="l1639"></a>sententiæ. Sic igiture sentias. Ejus essentia Verbum et princi<a id="l1640"></a>pij et finis expers, verbum esse dicis: Eo contentus sum; <a id="l1641"></a>ita crede. Siquid præterea adjungis, id tollo. Siquid ad impiam <a id="l1642"></a>separationem fraudulenter consuis, id nec videre nec intelligere <a id="l1643"></a>me confiteor. Si hospitium corporis assumis ad divinorum <a id="l1644"></a>operum dispensationem, non improbo. And a little after this the Bishops <a id="l1645"></a>of Egypt &amp; the West convened at Serdica  write thus in their <a id="l1646"></a>general Epistle to all the Churches. Confitemur filium esse virtutem Patris <a id="l1647"></a>Confitemur illum esse Verbum Dei Patris præter quod <a id="l1648"></a>nullum est aliud: et Verbum verum Deum et sapi<a id="l1649"></a>entiam et virtutem esse. Verum autem filium esse tradi<a id="l1650"></a>mus non sicut alij Filij appellamur. Nam hi quidem <a id="l1651"></a>aut regenerationis causa Dij dicuntur, aut eo quod <a id="l1652"></a>digni habiti fuerint Filij non cupantur: non autem ob unam <a id="l1653"></a>ὑποστασιν substantiam quæ est Patris et ffilij</p>
<p id="par133" class="i0"> And the Latines translating the word by <em class="underline">unius substantiæ</em>  led their <a id="l1654"></a>people into the errors of the Cataphrygians &amp; Sabellians.

<p id="par134">The Bishops therefore at this time laid aside the use of the word  ουσία <a id="l1657"></a>with its compounds because it was not in scripture &amp;  created great <a id="l1658"></a>disturbances, &amp; also because the word ὁμόούσιος was rejected by their <a id="l1659"></a>father in the Council of Antioch long befor the meeting of the Council <a id="l1660"></a>of Nice &amp; was admitted by the Council of Nice simply or without <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>making<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l1661"></a>deliberation, &amp; became a stumbling block to the people who were apt to <a id="l1662"></a>understand it in another sense then that of the Council.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 64r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par135" class="i0">This made the Greeks suspect the Latines  as inclined to Sabellianism.

However, Sabellianism was <a id="l1666"></a>so far spread in the western Churches that  in opposition to those of this <a id="l1667"></a>opinion , the  Greeks were  necessitated <a id="l1668"></a>to  send the Acts of the Council of Nice to the Council of  Ariminum for <a id="l1669"></a>convincing the western Bishops that   the father &amp; son were two substances the son being in these Acts called ὁμοίουσιος  to the father. And after this conviction, &amp; the preaching of Hil. the <a id="l1671"></a>Latines (so far as I can find generally took una substantia  for two substances in number  &amp; one <a id="l1672"></a>in species,  (as two men  are one in species but not in <a id="l1673"></a>number) untill the dark ages came on &amp; the Acts of the Council of Nice <a id="l1674"></a>were lost &amp; forgotten.</p>
<p id="par136">And now you may understand the meaning of the controversy  which began  presently after the Council of Nice about the decree of that Council, &amp; lasted <a id="l1676"></a>till the  use of the word usia  was abrogated in the Councils of Ariminum &amp; Seleucia <a id="l1677"></a>Socrates thus describes the beginning of it. <sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup>Vox consubstantialis, sicut ac ex varijs <a id="l1678"></a>epistolis deprehendemus quas Episcopi post absolutam synodum ad se scripserunt <a id="l1679"></a>quorundam animos conturbabat.

<p id="par137" class="i0">And in relation to this controversy bishops of the Greek Church in the Council of Antioch  A.C. 341 <a id="l1697"></a> in the end of one of their Creeds mentioning the institution of baptism <a id="l1698"></a><sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup>Ite &amp; docte omnes gentes, baptizantes cunctos in nomine Patris et ffilij et <a id="l1699"></a>spiritus sancti, added these words: Patris  utique vere Patris, et ffilij vere ffilij <a id="l1700"></a>et Spiritus sancti revera spiritus sancti: ita ut hæc vocabula non sint nuda <a id="l1701"></a> et sine re vocabula; sed quæ accurate exprimant propriam <a id="l1702"></a>uniuscujusque <span class="large">hypostasin</span>, ordinem ac gloriam: adeo ut  <span class="large">hypo<a id="l1703"></a>stasi quidem</span> tres sint consensu autem unus.

<p id="par140">From the time that the power of influencing religion by  Councils came into the hand <a id="l1787"></a>of the Roman Emperors they modelled the Christian religion so as suited best with their own opinions &amp; that <a id="l1788"></a> interest of their Empire &amp; therefore  influenced by their own opinions they consulted the inclinations  of the people that all of them (heathens <a id="l1790"></a>hereticks &amp; Christians) might unite &amp; become of one mind &amp; one religion for <a id="l1791"></a>the quiet of the empire. And for the same reason they had chief regard to the Bishop <a id="l1792"></a>of Rome the first bishop of the Empire &amp; next after him to the bishop of Alexan<a id="l1793"></a>dria &amp; then to the bishop of Antioch. And after  Constantinople was made <a id="l1794"></a>the head of the eastern Empire &amp; its bishop  placed those of Alexandria &amp; <a id="l1795"></a>Antioch they had chief regard to the bishop of Constantinople next after the <a id="l1796"></a>bishop of Rome.</p>
<p id="par141">Not long after the Council of Nice, the Eastern Churches deposed Atha<a id="l1797"></a>nasius bishop of Alexandria, Marcellus Bishop of Ancyra &amp; <span class="hspac-n" title="8 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> bishop of <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <a id="l1798"></a>&amp; some others; &amp; the excommunicated persons appealed to the Bishop of Rome, &amp; he <a id="l1799"></a> taking hold of the opportunity to make himself universal Bishop <a id="l1800"></a>summoned the eastern Bishops to appear before a council at Rome &amp; justify <a id="l1801"></a>themselves But they wrote back a reprimanding letter representing that he had <a id="l1802"></a>no authority over them &amp; that it was the custome of the eastern &amp; western churches to agree to one anothers Councils. Then by the consent of the Greek &amp; Latin Emperors  Constantius &amp; Constans the <a id="l1803"></a>council  of Serdica was called, &amp; the Bishops of both parties came to Sardica but the  western bishops still contending <a id="l1804"></a>to judge the eastern,  the eastern refused to submit,  &amp; returned <a id="l1805"></a>back &amp; the western  made some Canons importing that appeals lay from all the churches to the <a id="l1806"></a>Bishop of Rome. This was in the year 347 &amp; about  8 or 10 years after this the <a id="l1807"></a>eastern Emperor  having conquered the western Empire made the <a id="l1808"></a>western bishops &amp; clergy subscribe to the sen<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>tence<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of the eastern councils against Atha<a id="l1809"></a>nasius, &amp; thereby  suppressed for a time the claim of the Bishop of Rome <a id="l1810"></a>to appeals  from the Councils of the eastern empire. And soon after by other <a id="l1811"></a>Councils the  Emperor abolished the use of the word homousion as not being in scripture nor <a id="l1812"></a>understood by the people  nor consistent with the decree of the council of 80 Bishops convened at <a id="l1813"></a>Antioch against Paul of Samosat:  8  years before which decree was  at that time communicated to all the <a id="l1814"></a>Churches &amp; unanimously apporved by them,  &amp; so was the decree of the Church <a id="l1815"></a>catholick.</p>

<p id="par143"> By this it appears that the mystery of iniquity worked in these days very strongly <a id="l1818"></a>in the west, the  language of  una substantia <a id="l1819"></a> being misunderstood by the  Latines &amp; leading them into the errors &amp; the language of una usia &amp; una hypostasis being <a id="l1821"></a>of as ill consequence amongst those Greeks who used it. ffor <a id="l1822"></a>una hypostasis is on all hands allowed to be sabellianism.
