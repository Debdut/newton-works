<div>
<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">The Introduction.</h2>
<p id="par3">The Greek Antiquities are full of poetical fictions because the Greeks <a id="l6"></a>wrote nothing in prose before the conquest of Asia by Cyrus the Persian. Then <a id="l7"></a>Pherecides Scyrius &amp; Cadmus Milesius introduced the writing in prose. Pherecy<a id="l8"></a>des Atheniensis about the end of the reign of Darius Hystaspis wrote of antiqui<a id="l9"></a>ties, &amp; digested his work by Genealogies &amp; was recconed one of the best genealo<a id="l10"></a>gers. Epimenides the historian proceeded also by genealogies; &amp; Hellanicus, who <a id="l11"></a>was twelve years older than Herodotus, digested his history by the ages or successions of <a id="l12"></a>the priestesses of Iuno Argiva. Others digested theirs by the kings of the Lacede<a id="l13"></a>monians, or Archons of Athens. Hippias the Elean about thirty years before the <a id="l14"></a>fall of the Persian Empire, published a breviary or list of the Olympic Victors; <a id="l15"></a>&amp; about ten years before the fall thereof, Ephorus the disciple of Isocrates formed <a id="l16"></a>a Chronological history of Greece, beginning with the return of the Heraclides <a id="l17"></a>into Peloponesus &amp; ending with the siege of Perinthus in the twentith year of <a id="l18"></a>Philip the father of Alexander the great But he digested things by generations, <a id="l19"></a>&amp; the recconing by Olympiads was not yet in use, nor doth it appear that the <a id="l20"></a>reigns of kings were yet set down by numbers of years. The Arundelian <a id="l21"></a>marbles were composed sixty years after the death of Alexander the <a id="l22"></a>great (An. 4 Olymp. 128) &amp; yet mention not the Olympiads. But in the <a id="l23"></a>next Olympiad, Timæus Siculus published an history  in <a id="l24"></a>several books down to his own times according to the Olympiads, comparing <a id="l25"></a>the Ephori, the kings of Sparta, the Archons of Athens, &amp; the Priestesses of <a id="l26"></a>Argos with the Olympic victors so as to make the Olympiads, &amp; the genealogies <a id="l27"></a>&amp; successions of Kings, Archons, &amp; Priestesses &amp; poetical histories suit with <a id="l28"></a>one another, according to the best of his judgement. And where he left off, <a id="l29"></a>Polybius began &amp; carried on the history.</p>
<p id="par4">So then a little after the death of Alexander the great they began to <a id="l30"></a>set down the generations reigns &amp; successions in numbers of years, &amp; by <a id="l31"></a>putting reigns &amp; successions equipollent to generations, &amp; three generations <a id="l32"></a>to an hundred or an hundred &amp; twenty years (as appears by their chronology) they have made the antiquities of Greece three or four <a id="l33"></a>hundred years older then the truth. And this was the original of the <a id="l34"></a>technical chronology of the Greeks. Eratosthenes wrote about an hundred <a id="l35"></a>years after the death of Alexander the great. He was followed by <a id="l36"></a>Apollodorus, &amp; these two have been followed ever since by Chronologers.</p>

<p id="par6">But how uncertain their Chronology is, &amp; how doubtful it was <a id="l37"></a>reputed by the Greeks of those times, may be understood by these passages of <a id="l38"></a>Plutarch. <em class="underline">Some reccon</em>, saith he<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>, <em class="underline">Lycurgus contemporary to Iphitus, &amp; to have <a id="l39"></a>been his companion in ordering the Olympic festivals: amongst whom was Aristotel <a id="l40"></a>the philosopher, arguing from the Olympic Disc which had the name of Lycurgus <a id="l41"></a>upon it. Others supputing the times by the succession of the kings of the Lace<a id="l42"></a>demonians, as Eratosthenes &amp; Apollodorus, affirm that he was not a few years <a id="l43"></a>older than the first Olympiad</em>. First Aristotel &amp; some others made him as old <a id="l44"></a>as the first Olympiad, then Eratosthenes, Apollodorus &amp; some others made <a id="l45"></a>him above an hundred years older. And in another place Plutarch<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> tells us: <a id="l46"></a><em class="underline">The congress of Solon with Crœsus, some think they can confute by Chronology. <a id="l47"></a>But an history so illustrious, &amp; verified by so many witnesses, &amp; (which is <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>more<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>) <a id="l48"></a>so agreeable to the manners of Solon, &amp; so worthy of the greatness <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>of his mind<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; of his wisdome, I cannot persuade my self to reject because <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>of some Chronolo<a id="l49"></a><span class="nb-n">}</span></span>gical Canons, as they call them: which hu<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ndreds of authors correcting have not<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l50"></a>yet been able to constitute any <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>thing certain, in which they could agree among themselves about repugnancies.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span></em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> It seems the Chronologers had made the legislature of Solon too ancient <a id="l51"></a>to consist with that Congress.</p>
<p id="par7">For reconciling such repugnancies, Chronologers have sometimes <a id="l52"></a>doubled the persons of men. So when the Poets had changed Io the daughter of Inachus into the Egyptian Isis, Chronologers made her husband Osiris <a id="l53"></a>or Bacchus &amp; his mistress Ariadne as old as Io, &amp; so feigned that there <a id="l54"></a>were two Ariadnes, one the mistress of Bacchus &amp; the other the mistress <a id="l55"></a>of Theseus, &amp; two Minoses their fathers, &amp; a younger Io the daughter of <a id="l56"></a>Iasus, writing Iasus corruptly for Inachus. And so they have made two <a id="l57"></a>Pandions &amp; two Erechtheuses, giving the name of Erechthonius to the first. <a id="l58"></a>Homer calls the first Erechtheus. And by such corruptions they have ex<a id="l59"></a>ceedingly perplexed ancient history.</p>
<p id="par8">And as for the chronology of the Latines, that is still more uncertain. <a id="l60"></a>Plutarch represents great uncertainties in the originals of Rome. And so doth Servius. The old records of the Latines were burnt by the Galls sixty <a id="l61"></a>&amp; four years before the death of Alexander the great, &amp; Quintus Fabius <a id="l62"></a>Pictor, the oldest historian of the Latines, lived an hundred years later <a id="l63"></a>than that king.</p>
<p id="par9">In sacred history, the Assyrian Empire began with Pul and Tiglathpilaser, &amp; lasted about 170 years. And accordingly Herodotus <a id="l64"></a>hath made Semiramis only five generations or about 166 years older <a id="l65"></a>than Nitocris the mother of the last king of Babylon. But Ctesias <a id="l66"></a>hath made Semiramis  1500 years older than Nitocris, <a id="l67"></a>&amp; feigned a long series of kings of Assyria whose names are not Assy<a id="l68"></a>rian nor have any affinity with the Assyrian names in scripture.</p>
<p id="par10">The priests of Egypt told Herodotus that Menes built Memphis &amp; <a id="l69"></a>the sumptuous temple of Vulcan in that city: &amp; that Rhampsinitus, Mæris, <a id="l70"></a>Asychis &amp; Psammiticus added magnificent porticos to that temple. And it <a id="l71"></a>is not likely that Memphis could be famous before Homer's days who <a id="l72"></a>doth not mention it, or that a temple could be above two or three <a id="l73"></a>hundred years in building. The reign of Psammiticus began about <a id="l74"></a>655 years before Christ, &amp; I place the founding of this temple by Menes about <a id="l75"></a>257 years earlier. But the Priests of Egypt had so magnified their <a id="l76"></a>antiquities before the days of Herodotus, as to tell him that from Menes <a id="l77"></a>to Mæris (who reigned 200 years before Psammiticus,) there were <a id="l78"></a>330 kings whose reigns took up as many ages, that is eleven thousand <a id="l79"></a>years, &amp; had filled up the interval with feigned kings who had done  nothing. And before the days of Diodorus Siculus, they had raised their an<a id="l80"></a>tiquities so much higher; as to place six eight or ten new reigns of <a id="l81"></a>kings between those kings whom they had represented to Herodotus <a id="l82"></a>to succeed one another immediately.</p>
<p id="par11">In the kingdom of Sicyon Chronologers have split Apis Epaphus <a id="l83"></a>or Epopeus into two kings whom they call Apis &amp; Epopeus, &amp; between <a id="l84"></a>them have inserted eleven or twelve feigned names of kings who did <a id="l85"></a>nothing, &amp; thereby they have made its founder Ægialeus three <a id="l86"></a>hundred years older then his brother Phoroneus. Some have <a id="l87"></a>made the kings of Germany as old as the flood. And yet before the <a id="l88"></a>use of letters the names &amp; actions of men could scarce be remembred <a id="l89"></a>above eighty or an hundred years after their deaths: &amp; therefore I <a id="l90"></a>admit no chronology of things done in Europe above eighty years <a id="l91"></a>before Cadmus brought letters into Europe; none of things done in <a id="l92"></a>Germany before the rise of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p id="par12">Now since Eratosthenes &amp; Apollodorus computed the times by <a id="l93"></a>the reigns of the kings of Sparta, and (as appears by their chronology <a id="l94"></a>still followed) have made the seventeen reigns of these kings in both <a id="l95"></a>races between the return of the Heraclides into Peloponesus &amp; the battel <a id="l96"></a>of Thermopylæ take up 622 years, which is after the rate of 36<span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1" style="width: 0.712em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.709em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.353em, 1000.71em, 3.043em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-3"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.474em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.3em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -4.426em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-4" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">1</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.32em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -3.593em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-5" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">2</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1000.47em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 0.474em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.452em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.389em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-1"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></script> years <a id="l97"></a>to a reign, &amp; yet a race of seventeen kings of that length is no where <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> to be met with in all true history, &amp; kings at a moderate recconing <a id="l98"></a>reign but 18 or 20 years a piece one with another: I have stated the time <a id="l99"></a>of the return of the Heraclides by the last way of recconing, placing it <a id="l100"></a>about 340 years before the battel of Thermopylæ.

<h2 id="hd3" class="cent"> A short Chronicle <a id="l110"></a><br>from the first memory of things in Europe <a id="l111"></a><br>to the conquest of Persia by Alexander the great.</h2>
<p id="par13" class="cent">The times are set down in years <a id="l112"></a><br>before Christ.</p>
<p id="par14">The Canaanites who fled from Ioshua retired in great numbers into Egypt, <a id="l113"></a>&amp; there conquered Timaus, Thamus, or Thammuz king of the lower Egypt, &amp; reigned <a id="l114"></a>there under their kings Salatis, Beon, Apachnas, Apophis, Ianias, Assis, &amp;c untill the  <a id="l115"></a>days of Eli &amp; Samuel. They fed on flesh, &amp; sacrificed men after the manner <a id="l116"></a>of the Phenicians, &amp; were called shepherds by the Egyptians, who lived only on <a id="l117"></a>the fruits of the earth &amp; abominated flesheaters. The upper parts of Egypt <a id="l118"></a>were in those days under many kings reigning at Coptos, Thebes, This, Ele<a id="l119"></a>phantis, &amp; other places, which by conquering one another grew by degrees into <a id="l120"></a>one kingdom, over which Misphragmuthosis reigned in the days of Eli.</p>
<p id="par15">In the year before Christ  1125, Mephres reigned over the upper <a id="l121"></a>Egypt from Syene to Heliopolis, &amp; his successor Misphragmuthosis made a lasting <a id="l122"></a>war upon the shepherds soon after, &amp; caused many of them to fly into Palestine, <a id="l123"></a>Idumæa, Syria, &amp; Libya; &amp; under Lelex, Æzeus, Inachus, Pelasgus, Æolus the <a id="l124"></a>first, Cecrops, &amp; other captains, into Greece. Before those days Greece &amp; all  <a id="l125"></a>Europe was peopled by wandring Cimmerians &amp; Scythians from the backside of <a id="l126"></a>the Euxine sea; who lived a rambling wild sort of life like the Tartars in the <a id="l127"></a>northern parts of Asia. Of their race was Ogyges in whose days these Egyptian <a id="l128"></a>strangers came into Greece. The rest of the shepherds were shut up by Mis<a id="l129"></a>phragmuthosis in a part of the lower Egypt called Abaris or Pelusium.</p>
<p id="par16">In the year 1100 the Philistims strengthned by the access of the shepherds <a id="l130"></a>conquer Israel, &amp; take the Ark. Samuel judges Israel.</p>
<p id="par17">1085 Hæmon the son of Pelasgus reigns in Thessaly.</p>
<p id="par18">1080 Lycaon the son of Pelasgus builds Lycosura; Phoronæus the son of <a id="l131"></a>Inachus Phoronicum afterwards called Argos; Ægialeus the brother of Pho<a id="l132"></a>roneus &amp; son of Inachus Ægialeum afterwards called Sicyon. And these were <a id="l133"></a>the oldest towns in Peloponesus. Till then they built only single houses <a id="l134"></a>scattered up &amp; down in the fields. About the same time Cecrops built Cecropia <a id="l135"></a>in Attica afterwards called Athens, &amp; Eleusine the son of Ogyges built Eleusina. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> And these towns gave a beginning to the kingdoms of the Arcadians, Argives, <a id="l136"></a>Sicyons, Athenians, Eleusinians, &amp;c.</p>
<p id="par19">1070. Amosis or Tethmosis the successor of Misphragmuthosis abolishes <a id="l137"></a>the Phenician custom  in Heliopolis of sacrificing men, <a id="l138"></a>&amp; drives the shepherds out of Abaris. By their access the Philistims become <a id="l139"></a>so numerous as to bring into the field against Saul 30000 chariots, 6000 <a id="l140"></a>horsemen, &amp; people as the sand on the sea shore for multitude. Abas the father <a id="l141"></a>of Acrisius &amp; Prœtus comes from Egypt.</p>
<p id="par20">1069. Saul is made king of  Israel, &amp; by the hand of Ionathan gets a <a id="l142"></a>great victory over the Philistims. Eurotas the son of Lelex, &amp; Lacedemon who <a id="l143"></a>married Sparta the daughter of Eurotas, reign in Laconia, &amp; build Sparta.</p>
<p id="par21">1060. Samuel dyes.</p>
<p id="par22">1059. David made king.</p>
<p id="par23"> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 4v &gt; </span><span class="ns"></span> 1048. The Edomites are conquered &amp; dispersed by David, &amp; some of them fly into <a id="l150"></a>Egypt with their young King Hadad. Others fly to the Persian Gulf with their Commander <a id="l151"></a>Oannes. And others fly from the red sea to the coast of the mediterranean &amp; fortify <a id="l152"></a>Azoth against David, &amp; take Zidon. And the Zidonians who fled from them build Tyre &amp; Ara<a id="l153"></a>dus, &amp; make Abibalus king of Tyre. These Edomites carry to all places their arts &amp; sciences, amongst which were their Navigation, Astronomy, &amp; Letters. For in Idumæa they had con<a id="l154"></a>stellations &amp; letters before the days of Iob, who mentions them. And there Moses learnt to <a id="l155"></a>write the law in a book. These Edomites who fled to the Mediterranean, translating the <a id="l156"></a>word Erythræa into that of Phœnicia, give the name of Phenicians to themselves, &amp; that of Phenicia to all the sea coasts of Palestine from Azoth to Zidon. And hence came <a id="l157"></a>the tradition of the Persians, &amp; of the Phœnicians themselves, mentioned by Herodotus, <a id="l158"></a>that the Phœnicians came originally from the red sea, &amp; presently undertook long voiages <a id="l159"></a>on the Mediterranean.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 4r resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par24">1047. Acrisius marries Eurydice the daughter of Lacedæmon &amp; Sparta.</p>
<p id="par25">1045. The Phenician marriners who fled from the red sea being used <a id="l160"></a>to long voiages for the sake of trafic, begin the like voiages on the Me<a id="l161"></a>diterranean  from Zidon; &amp; sailing as far as Greece, <a id="l162"></a>carry away Io the daughter of Inachus who with other Greecian weo<a id="l163"></a>men came to their ships to buy their merchandice. The Greek seas begin <a id="l164"></a>to be infested with Pyrates. Endymion builds Elis.</p>
<p id="par26">1043 The Syrians of Zobah &amp; Damascus are conquered by David.</p>
<p id="par27">1042 Nyctimus the son of Lycaon reigns in Arcadia. Deucalion still alive.</p>
<p id="par28">1041 Many of the Phenicians &amp; Syrians fleeing from Zidon &amp; Da<a id="l165"></a>vid, come under the conduct of Cadmus, Cilix, Phænix, Membliarius, Nicteus, <a id="l166"></a>Thasus, Atymnus, &amp; other captains into Asia minor, Crete, Greece, &amp; Libya; <a id="l167"></a>&amp; introduce letters, music, poetry, the Octaeteris, metals and their fa<a id="l168"></a>brication, &amp; other arts sciences &amp; customes of the Phenicians. At <a id="l169"></a>this time Cranaus the successor of Cecrops reigned in Attica, &amp; in his <a id="l170"></a>reign &amp; the beginning of the reign of Nyctimus the Greeks place the flood <a id="l171"></a>of Deucalion. This flood was succeeded by four ages or generations <a id="l172"></a>of men in the first of which Chiron the son of Saturn  &amp; Philyra was born, &amp; the last of which according to Hesiod ended with <a id="l173"></a>the Trojan war, &amp; so place the destruction of Troy four generations <a id="l174"></a>or about 133 years later then that flood &amp; then the coming of Cadmus, <a id="l175"></a>recconing with the ancients three generations to an hundred years. <a id="l176"></a>With these Phenicians came a sort of men skilled in the religious <a id="l177"></a>mysteries Arts &amp; sciences of Phenicia, &amp; setled in several places <a id="l178"></a>under the names of Curetes, Corybantes, Telchines, &amp; Idæi Dactyli.</p>
<p id="par29">1039. Hellen the son of Deucalion, &amp; father of Æolus, Xuthus, <a id="l179"></a>&amp; Dorus flourishes.</p>
<p id="par30">1037. Erectheus reigns in Attica.</p>
<p id="par31">1036. Ceres a woman of Cicily, in seeking her daughter who was <a id="l180"></a>stollen, comes into Attica, &amp; there teaches the Greeks to sow corn; for which <a id="l181"></a>benefaction she was deified after death. She first taught the art to Trip<a id="l182"></a>tolemus the young son of Celeus king of Eleusis.</p>
<p id="par32">1035. The Idæi Dactyli find out iron in mount Ida in Crete, <a id="l183"></a>&amp; work it into Armour &amp; iron tools, &amp; thereby give a beginning to the <a id="l184"></a>trades of smiths &amp; carpenters in Europe. And by singing &amp; dancing in their <a id="l185"></a>armour &amp; keeping time by striking upon one anothers armour with their swords, they <a id="l186"></a>bring in music &amp; poetry. And at the same time they nurse up the Cretan <a id="l187"></a>Iupiter in a cave of the same mountain, dancing about him in their armour.</p>
<p id="par33">1034. Ammon reigns in Egypt. He conquered Libya, &amp; reduced that people <a id="l188"></a>from a wandering salvage life to a civil one, &amp; taught them to lay up the <a id="l189"></a>fruits of the earth. And from him Libya &amp; the desert above it were anciently <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> called Ammonia. He was the first that built long &amp; tall ships with sails, <a id="l190"></a>&amp; had a fleet of such ships on the Red sea, &amp; another on the Mediterranean <a id="l191"></a>at Irasa in Libya. Till then they used small &amp; round vessels of burden <a id="l192"></a>invented on the red sea, &amp; kept within sight of the shore. For en<a id="l193"></a>abling them to cross the seas without seeing the shore, the Egyptians <a id="l194"></a>began in his days to observe the starrs. And from this beginning As<a id="l195"></a>tronomy &amp; Sailing had their rise. Hitherto the Lunisolar year had <a id="l196"></a>been in use: but this year being of an uncertain length, &amp; so, unfit <a id="l197"></a>for Astronomy, in his days &amp; in the days of his sons &amp; grandsons, by <a id="l198"></a>observing the heliacal risings and settings of the starrs, they found the <a id="l199"></a>length of the solar year, &amp; made it consist of five days more then <a id="l200"></a>the twelve calendar months of the old Lunisolar year.</p>
<p id="par34">1028 Oenotrus the youngest son of Lycaon (the Ianus of the <a id="l201"></a>Latins) led the first colony of the Greeks into Italy, &amp; there taught them <a id="l202"></a>to build houses. Perseus born.</p>
<p id="par35">1025 Arcas the son of Callisto &amp; grandson of Lycaon, &amp; Eumelus <a id="l203"></a>the first King of Achaia, received breadcorn from Triptolemus.</p>

Antiopa the daughter of <a id="l208"></a>Nicteus is sent home to Lycus by Lamedon the successor of Apis, &amp; in the way brings forth Amphion &amp; Zethus.</p>
<p id="par37">1019 Solomon reigns &amp; marries the daughter of Ammon, &amp; by means <a id="l209"></a>of this affinity is supplied with horses from Egypt. And his merchants also <a id="l210"></a>bring horses from thence for all the Kings of the Hittites &amp; Syrians. For horses <a id="l211"></a>came originally from Libya. And thence Neptune was called Equestris. Tantalus king of Phrygia steales Ganimede the son of Tros king of Troas.</p>
<p id="par38">1017. Solomon by the assistance of the Tyrians &amp; Aradians who had <a id="l212"></a>mariners among them acquainted with the red sea, sets out a fleet upon <a id="l213"></a>that sea. Those assistants build new cities in the Persian gulf called Tyre <a id="l214"></a>&amp; Aradus. Creusa the daughter of Erechtheus marries  Xuthus the son of Hellen. Erechtheus having first celebrated <a id="l216"></a>the Panathenæa joyns horses to a chariot. Ægina daughter of Asopus &amp; mother of Æacus born.</p>
<p id="par39"> 1015 The Temple of Solomon is founded. Minos reigns in Crete <a id="l217"></a>expelling his father Asterius,  who flees into Italy &amp; becomes the Saturn of <a id="l218"></a>the Latines. Ammon takes Gezer from the Canaanites &amp; gives it to his daughter <a id="l219"></a>Solomon's wife.</p>
<p id="par40">1014. Ammon places Cepheus at Ioppa. Ceres being dead Eumolpus <a id="l220"></a>institutes her mysteries in Eleusine. The mysteries of Rea are instituted in <a id="l221"></a>Phrygia in the city Cybele. About this time temples begin to be built in Greece. <a id="l222"></a>Hyagnis the Phrygian invents the pipe. After the example of the common council <a id="l223"></a>of the five lords of the Philistims the Greeks set up the Amphictyonic council <a id="l224"></a>first at Thermopylæ by the influence of Amphictyon the son of Deucalion, <a id="l225"></a>&amp; a few years after at Delphi by the influence of Acrisius. Among the <a id="l226"></a>cites whose deputies met at Thermopylæ I do not find Athens, &amp; therefore <a id="l227"></a>doubt whether Amphictyon was king of that city. If he was the son of Deu<a id="l228"></a>calion &amp; brother of Hellen, he &amp; Cranaus might reign together in several <a id="l229"></a>parts of Attica. But I meet with a later Amphictyon who enterteined the <a id="l230"></a>great Bacchus. This Council worshipped Ceres, &amp; therefore was instituted <a id="l231"></a>after her death.</p>
<p id="par41">1012 Cecrops II reigns in Attica. Caucon teaches the mysteries of Ceres <a id="l232"></a>in Messene. Sesac in the reign of his father Ammon invades Arabia Felix, &amp; sets  up pillars at the mouth of the red sea.</p>

<p id="par46">1005 Andromeda carried away from Ioppa by Perseus.</p>
<p id="par47">1002 Sesac reigns in Egypt &amp; adornes Thebes, dedicating it to his <a id="l241"></a>father Ammon by the name of No-Ammon or Ammon-No, that is the <a id="l242"></a>people or city of Ammon. Whence the Greeks called it Diospolis, the city <a id="l243"></a>of Iupiter. Sesac also erected Temples &amp; Oracles to his father in Thebes <a id="l244"></a>Ammonia &amp; Ethiopia, &amp; thereby caused his father to be worshipped as a <a id="l245"></a>God in those countries, &amp; I think also in Arabia Felix. And this was <a id="l246"></a>the original of the worship of Iupiter Ammon, &amp; the first mention of <a id="l247"></a>Oracles that I meet with in prophane history.</p>

<p id="par53">987. Dædalus kills his nephew Talus, &amp; flyes to Minos. A Priestess of Iu<a id="l254"></a>piter Ammon, being brought by Phœnician merchants into Greece, sets up the <a id="l255"></a>Oracle of Iupiter at Dodona. And this gives a beginning to Oracles in Greece. <a id="l256"></a>And by their dictates the worship of the dead is every where introduced.</p>
<p id="par54">981. Alcmena born of Electryo the son of Perseus &amp; Andromeda, &amp; of Eurydice the daughter of Pelops.</p>

<p id="par60">967 Sesac passing over the Hellespont conquers Thrace, kills <a id="l266"></a>Lycurgus king thereof, &amp; gives his kingdom &amp; one of his singing weomen to <a id="l267"></a>Oeagrus the father of Orpheus. Sesac had in his army Ethiopians commanded <a id="l268"></a>by Pan, &amp; Libyan weomen commanded by Merina or Minerva. It was the <a id="l269"></a>custom of the Ethiopians to dance when they were entring into a battel, &amp; from their skipping they were painted with goats feet in the form of Satyrs.</p>

He left also in Colchos geographical Tables <a id="l275"></a>of all his conquests: &amp; thence Geography had its rise. His singing weomen were <a id="l276"></a>celebrated in Thrace by the name of the Muses. And the daughters of Pierus <a id="l277"></a>a Thracian imitating them, were celebrated by the same name.</p>
<p id="par63">964. Minos making war upon Cocalus king of Sicily, is slain by him. <a id="l278"></a>He was eminent for his dominion his Laws &amp; his justice. Vpon his sepulchre <a id="l279"></a>visited by Pythagoras, was this inscription ΤΟΥ ΔΙΟΣ, the sepulchre of <a id="l280"></a>Iupiter. Danaus with his daughters flying from his brother Ægyptus (that <a id="l281"></a>is from Sesac) comes into Greece. Sesac using the advice of his secretary <a id="l282"></a>Thoth, distributes Egypt into  XXXVI Nomes, &amp; in every Nome erects a <a id="l283"></a>temple, &amp; appoints the several Gods, festivals &amp; religions of the several <a id="l284"></a>Nomes. The temples were the sepulchres of his great men where they <a id="l285"></a>were to be buried &amp; worshipped after death, each in his own temple, with <a id="l286"></a>ceremonies &amp; festivals appointed by him; while he &amp; his queen, by the names <a id="l287"></a>of Osiris &amp; Isis, were to be worshipped in all Egypt. These were the temples <a id="l288"></a>seen &amp; described by Lucian eleven hundred years after, to be of one &amp; the <a id="l289"></a>same age. And this was the original of the several Nomes of Egypt, <a id="l290"></a>&amp; of the several Gods &amp; several religions of those Nomes. Sesac divided <a id="l291"></a>also the land of Egypt by measure amongst his soldiers, &amp; thence Geometry <a id="l292"></a>had its rise. Hercules &amp; Eurystheus born.</p>
<p id="par64">963. Amphictyon brings the twelve Gods of Egypt into Greece, &amp; these <a id="l293"></a>are the <em class="underline">Dii magni majorum gentium</em> to whom the earth and Planets &amp; elements are dedicated.</p>
<p id="par65">962. Phryxus &amp; Helle fly from their stepmother Ino the daughter of Cadmus. Helle <a id="l294"></a>is drowned in the Hellespont so named from her, but Phryxus arrived at Colchos.</p>

<p id="par67">958. Oedipus kills his father Laius. Sthenelus the son of Perseus reigns in Mycene.</p>
<p id="par68">956. Sesac is slain by his brother Iapetus, who after death was deified in Afric <a id="l295"></a>by the name of Neptune, &amp; called Typhon by the Ægyptians. Orus reigns &amp; routs <a id="l296"></a>the Libyans, who under the conduct of Iapetus &amp; his son Antæus or Atlas <a id="l297"></a>invaded Egypt. Sesac from his making the river Nile usefull by cutting channels <a id="l298"></a>from it to all the cities of Egypt, was called by its names, Sihor or Siris, Nilus &amp; <a id="l299"></a>Egyptus. The Greeks hearing the Egyptians lament O Siris &amp; Bou Siris <a id="l300"></a>called him Osiris &amp; Busiris. The Arabians from his great acts called him <a id="l301"></a>Bacchus, that is, the great. The Phrygians called him Ma-fors or Mavors <a id="l302"></a>the valiant, &amp; by contraction Mars. Because he set up pillars in all <a id="l303"></a>his conquests, &amp; his army in his fathers reign fought against the Afri<a id="l304"></a>cans with clubs, he is painted with pillars &amp; a club. And this is that Hercules <a id="l305"></a>who, according to Cicero, was born upon the Nile, &amp; according to Eudoxus, <a id="l306"></a>was slain by Typhon, &amp; according to Diodorus, was an Egyptian, &amp; went <a id="l307"></a>over a great part of the world, &amp; set up the pillars in Afric. He seems <a id="l308"></a>to be also the Belus who, according to Diodorus, led a Colony of Egyp<a id="l309"></a>tians to Babylon, &amp; there instituted priests called Chaldeans, who were <a id="l310"></a>free from taxes &amp; observed the starrs as in Egypt. Hitherto Iudah &amp; <a id="l311"></a>Israel laboured under great vexations, but henceforward Asa king <a id="l312"></a>of Iudah had peace ten years.</p>
<p id="par69">947 The Ethiopians invade Egypt, &amp; drown Orus in the Nile. <a id="l313"></a>Thereupon Bubaste the sister of Orus kills herself by falling from the <a id="l314"></a>top of an house: &amp; their mother Isis or Astræa goes mad. And thus ended <a id="l315"></a>the reign of the Gods of Egypt.</p>
<p id="par70">946. Zerah the Ethiopian is overthrown by Asa. The people <a id="l316"></a>of the lower Egypt make Osarsiphus their King, &amp; call in two hundred <a id="l317"></a>thousand Iews &amp; Phenicians against the Ethiopians. Menes or Ameno<a id="l318"></a>phis the young son of Zerah &amp; Cissia reigns.</p>
<p id="par71">944. The Ethiopians under Amenophis retire from the lower <a id="l319"></a>Egypt &amp; fortify Memphis against Osarsiphus. And by these warrs &amp; the Argo<a id="l320"></a>nautic expedition, the great empire of Egypt breaks in pieces. Eurystheus <a id="l321"></a>the son of Sthenelus reigns in Mycene.</p>
<p id="par72">943. Evander &amp; his mother Carmenta carry letters into Italy.</p>
<p id="par73">942. Orpheus deifies the son of Semele by the name of Bacchus, &amp; appoints <a id="l322"></a>his ceremonies.</p>
<p id="par74">940. The great men of Greece hearing of the civil warrs &amp; distractions <a id="l323"></a>of Egypt, resolve to send an embassy to the nations upon the Euxine &amp; Medi<a id="l324"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span>terranean seas subject to that empire, &amp; for that end order the building of the <a id="l325"></a>ship Argo.</p>
<p id="par75">939. The ship Argo is built after the pattern of the long ship in which <a id="l326"></a>Danaus came into Greece. And this was the first long ship built by the Greeks. <a id="l327"></a>Chiron who was born in the golden age, forms the Constellations for the use <a id="l328"></a>of the Argonauts &amp; places the solstitial &amp; equinoctial points in the fifteenth <a id="l329"></a>degrees or middles of the  constellations of Cancer Chelæ Capricorn <a id="l330"></a>&amp; Aries. Meton in the year of Nabonassar 316 observed the summer <a id="l331"></a>solstice in the eighth degree of Cancer, &amp; therefore the solstice had then <a id="l332"></a>gone back seven degrees. It goes back one degree in about seventy &amp; <a id="l333"></a>two years &amp; seven degrees in about 504 years. Count these years <a id="l334"></a>back from the year of Nabonassar 316, &amp; they will place the Argo<a id="l335"></a>nautic expedition about 936 years before Christ. Gingris the son of <a id="l336"></a>Thoas slain &amp; deified by the name of Adonis.</p>
<p id="par76">938 Theseus being fifty years old steals Hellena then seven years old. Perithous <a id="l337"></a>the son of Ixion endeavouring to steal Persephone the daughter of Orcus king of the <a id="l338"></a>Molossians, is slain by the dog of Orcus; &amp; his companion Theseus is taken &amp; imprison<a id="l339"></a>ed. Hellena is set at liberty by her brothers.</p>
<p id="par77">937. The Argonautic expedition. Prometheus leaves Mount Caucasus, <a id="l340"></a>being set at liberty by Hercules. Laomedon king of Troy is slain by Hercu<a id="l341"></a>les. Priam succeeds him. Talus a brazen man of the brazen age, the son of <a id="l342"></a>Minos, is slain by the Argonauts. Æsculapius &amp; Hercules were Argonauts <a id="l343"></a>&amp; Hippocrates was the eighteenth from Æsculapius by the fathers side &amp; the <a id="l344"></a>nineteenth from Hercules by the mothers side. And because these generations <a id="l345"></a>being noted in history were most probably by the chief of the family, &amp; for <a id="l346"></a>the most part by the eldest sons: we may reckon 28 or at the most 30 <a id="l347"></a>years to a generation. And thus the seventeen intervalls by the fathers side <a id="l348"></a>&amp; eighteen by the mothers will at a middle recconing amount unto about <a id="l349"></a>507 years. Which being counted backwards from the beginning of <a id="l350"></a>the Peloponesian war (at which time Hippocrates began to flourish) <a id="l351"></a>will reach up to the time where we have placed the Argonautic expedition.</p>
<p id="par78">936. Theseus is set at liberty by Hercules.</p>
<p id="par79">934. The hunting of the Calydonian boar slain by Meleager.</p>
<p id="par80">930. Amenophis with an army out of Æthiopia &amp; Thebais invades the <a id="l352"></a>lower Ægypt, conquers Osarsiphus, &amp; drives out the Iews &amp; Canaanites. And this is recconed the second expulsion of the shepherds. Callicopis dyes, <a id="l353"></a>&amp; is deified by Thoas  with Temples at Paphos &amp; Amathus in Cyprus <a id="l354"></a>&amp; at Byblus in Syria, &amp; with Priests &amp; sacred rites, &amp; becomes the Venus of <a id="l355"></a>the ancients, &amp; the Dea Cypria &amp; Dea Syria. And from these &amp; other places where <a id="l356"></a>temples were erected to her, she was also called Paphia, Amathusia, Byblia, <a id="l357"></a>Cytharea, Salaminia, Cnidia, Erycina, Idalia, &amp;c. And her three waiting weo<a id="l358"></a>men became the three Graces.</p>
<p id="par81">928. The war of the seven capitains against Thebes.</p>
<p id="par82">927. Hercules &amp; Esculapius are deified. Eurystheus drives the Hera<a id="l359"></a>clides out of Peloponesus. He is slain by Hyllus the son of Hercules. Atreus the son of  Pelops succeeds him in the Kingdom of the <a id="l360"></a>Mycenæ. Menestheus the great grandson of Erechtheus reigns at Athens.</p>
<p id="par83">925 Theseus is slain being cast down from a rock.</p>
<p id="par84">924 Hyllus invading Peloponesus is slain by Echemus.</p>
<p id="par85">919 Atreus dyes. Agamemnon reigns. In the absence of Menelaus who <a id="l361"></a>went to look after what his father Atreus had left to him, Paris steals Helena.</p>
<p id="par86">918 The second war against Thebes.</p>
<p id="par87">912. Thoas king of Cyprus &amp; part of Phœnicia dyes; &amp; for making ar<a id="l362"></a>mour for the kings of Egypt, is deified with a sumptuous temple at Memphis <a id="l363"></a>by the name of Baal Canaan, Vulcan. This temple was said to be built by Menes <a id="l364"></a>the first king of Egypt who reigned next after the Gods, that is, by Menoph or <a id="l365"></a>Amenophis who reigned next after the death of Osiris, Isis, Orus, Bubaste &amp; Thoth. <a id="l366"></a>The city Memphis was also said to be built by Menes. He began to build it when <a id="l367"></a>he fortified it against Osarsiphus. And from him it was called Menoph, Moph, <a id="l368"></a>Noph, &amp;c; &amp; is to this day called Menuf by the Arabians. And therefore Menes <a id="l369"></a>who built the city &amp; temple was Menoph or Amenophis. The Priests of Egypt <a id="l370"></a>at length made this temple above a thousand years older then Amenophis, &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> some of them five or ten thousand years older. But it could not be above <a id="l371"></a>two or three hundred years older than the reign of Psammiticus who finished <a id="l372"></a>it &amp; died 614 years before Christ. When Menoph or Menes built the city <a id="l373"></a>he built a bridge there over the Nile: a work too great to be older than the <a id="l374"></a>monarchy of Egypt.</p>
<p id="par88">909. Amenophis (called Memnon by the Greeks) built the Memnonia <a id="l375"></a>at Susa, whilst Egypt was under the government of Proteus his viceroy.</p>
<p id="par89">904. Troy taken. Amenophis was still at Susa; the Greeks feigning <a id="l376"></a>that he came from thence to the Trojan war.</p>
<p id="par90">903. Demophoon the son of Theseus by Phœdra the daughter of Minos, <a id="l377"></a>reigns at Athens.</p>
<p id="par91">901. Amenophis builds small Pyramids in Cochome.</p>
<p id="par92">895. Teucer builds Salamis in Cyprus. Hadad or Benhadad king of <a id="l378"></a>Syria dyes &amp; is deified at Damascus with a temple &amp; ceremonies.</p>
<p id="par93">887. Amenophis dyes &amp; is succeeded by his son Ramesses or Rhampsi<a id="l379"></a>nitus, who builds the western Portico of the temple of Vulcan. The Egyptians <a id="l380"></a>dedicated to Osiris, Isis, Orus senior, Typhon, &amp; Nephthe the sister &amp; wife of <a id="l381"></a>Typhon, the five days added by the Egyptians to the twelve Calendar months <a id="l382"></a>of the old Luni-solar year, &amp; said that they were added when these five <a id="l383"></a>princes were born. They were therefore added in the reign of Ammon <a id="l384"></a>the father of these five princes. But this year was scarce brought into <a id="l385"></a>common use before the reign of Amenophis. For in his temple or se <a id="l386"></a>pulchre at Abydus, they placed a circle of 365 cubits in compass covered <a id="l387"></a>on the upper side with a plate of gold, &amp; divided into 365 equal parts to <a id="l388"></a>represent all the days of the year; every part having the day of the <a id="l389"></a>yeare &amp; the heliacal risings &amp; settings of the starrs on that day noted <a id="l390"></a>upon it. And this circle remained there till Cambyses spoiled the temples <a id="l391"></a>of Egypt. And from this monument I collect that it was Amenophis who <a id="l392"></a>established this year, fixing the beginning thereof to one of the four <a id="l393"></a>cardinal points of the heavens. For had not the beginning thereof been <a id="l394"></a>now fixed, the heliacal risings &amp; settings of the starrs could not have <a id="l395"></a>been noted upon the days thereof. The priests of Egypt therefore in <a id="l396"></a>the reign of Amenophis continued to observe the heliacal risings <a id="l397"></a>&amp; settings of the starrs upon every day. And when by the sun's me<a id="l398"></a>ridional altitudes they had found the solstices &amp; equinoxes according to <a id="l399"></a>the sun's mean motion (his equation being not yet known) they fixed <a id="l400"></a>the beginning of this year to the vernal equinox, &amp; in memory there <a id="l401"></a>of erected this monument. Now this year being carried into Chaldea, the <a id="l402"></a>Chaldeans began their year of Nabonassar on the same Thoth with the <a id="l403"></a>Egyptians, &amp; made it of the same length. And the Thoth of the first year <a id="l404"></a>of Nabonassar fell upon the 26<sup>th</sup> day of February: which was 33 days <a id="l405"></a>&amp; five hours before the vernal equinox according to the suns mean <a id="l406"></a>motion. And the Thoth of this year moves backwards 33 days &amp; five <a id="l407"></a>hours in 137 years, &amp; therefore fell upon the vernal equinox 137 <a id="l408"></a>years before the Æra of Nabonassar began, that is, 884 years before <a id="l409"></a>Christ. And if it began upon the day next after the Vernal Equinox, it <a id="l410"></a>might begin three or four years earlier. And there we may place <a id="l411"></a>the death of this king. The Greeks feigned that he was the son of <a id="l412"></a>Tithonus, &amp; therefore he was born after the return of Sesac into Egypt <a id="l413"></a>with Tithonus &amp; other captives, &amp; so might be about 70 or 75 years old at his death.</p>
<p id="par94">886. Vlysses leaves Calypso in the island Ogygie (perhaps Cadis or <a id="l414"></a>Cales.) She was the daughter of Atlas according to Homer. The an<a id="l415"></a>cients at length feigned that this island, (which from Atlas they called <a id="l416"></a>Atlantis) had been as big as all Europe Africa &amp; Asia, but was sunk into the Sea.</p>
<p id="par95">883 Dido builds Carthage, &amp; the Phenicians begin presently after <a id="l417"></a>to sail as far as to the straights mouth &amp; beyond. Æneas was still alive according <a id="l418"></a>to Virgil.</p>
<p id="par96">870. Hesiod flourishes. He hath told us himself that he lived in the age <a id="l419"></a>next after the warrs of Thebes &amp; Troy, &amp; that this age should end when the <a id="l420"></a>men then living grew hoary &amp; dropt into the grave: &amp; therefore it was <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> but of an ordinary length. And Herodotus has told us that Hesiod &amp; Homer were but <a id="l421"></a>400 years older then himself. Whence it follows that the destruction of Troy was <a id="l422"></a>not older than we have represented it.</p>
<p id="par97">860. Mœris reigns in Egypt. He adorned Memphis, &amp; translated the seat of <a id="l423"></a>his empire thither from Thebes. There he built the famous Labyrinth, &amp; the northern <a id="l424"></a>portico of the temple of Vulcane, &amp; dug the great Lake called the Lake of Mœris, <a id="l425"></a>&amp; upon the bottom of it built two great pyramids of brick. And these things being <a id="l426"></a>not  mentioned by Homer or Hesiod were unknown to them &amp; done <a id="l427"></a>after their days. Mœris wrote also a book of Geometry.</p>
<p id="par98">852. Hazael the successor of Hadad at Damascus dyes &amp; is deified, as was <a id="l428"></a>Hadad before. And these Gods together with Arathes the wife of Hadad were worshipped <a id="l429"></a>in their sepulchres or Temples till the days of Iosephus the Iew; &amp; the Syrians boasted <a id="l430"></a>their antiquity, not knowing, saith Iosephus, that they were  novel.</p>
<p id="par99">844. The Æolic migration. Bœotia formerly called Cadmeis is seized by the Bœotians.</p>
<p id="par100">838. Cheops reigns in Egypt. He built the greatest Pyramid for his sepul<a id="l431"></a>chre, &amp; forbad the worship of the former kings, intending to have been worshipped himself.</p>

<h2 id="hd5" class="cent">Of the Chronology of the first ages <a id="l509"></a>of the Greeks.</h2>
<p id="par187">All nations before they began to keep exact accounts of time have <a id="l510"></a>been prone to raise their antiquities, &amp; this humour has been promoted by <a id="l511"></a>the contentions between nations about their  originals. Herodotus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> tells us that the <a id="l512"></a>priests of Egypt recconed from the reign of Menes to that of Sethon who put <a id="l513"></a>Sennacherib to flight; three hundred forty &amp; one generations of men, &amp; as many priests <a id="l514"></a>of Vulcan, &amp; as many kings of Egypt: &amp; that three hundred generations make <a id="l515"></a>ten thousand years (for saith he, three generations of men make an hundred years;) <a id="l516"></a>&amp; the remaining forty &amp; one generations make 1340 years. And so the whole <a id="l517"></a>time from the reign of Menes to that of Sethon was 11340 years. And by this <a id="l518"></a>way of recconing, &amp; allotting longer reigns to the Gods of Egypt then to the kings <a id="l519"></a>which followed them, Herodotus tells us from the priests of Egypt, that from Pan <a id="l520"></a>to Amosis were 15000 years, &amp; from Hercules to Amosis 17000 years. So also <a id="l521"></a>the Chaldeans boasted of their antiquity. For Callisthenes the disciple of Aristotel <a id="l522"></a>sent astronomical observations from Babylon to Greece said to be of 1903 years <a id="l523"></a>standing before the times of Alexander the great. And the Chaldeans boast<a id="l524"></a>ed further that they had observed the starrs 473000 years. And there were <a id="l525"></a>others who made the kingdoms of Assyria Media &amp; Damascus much older <a id="l526"></a>then the truth.</p> 
<p id="par188">Some of the Greeks called the times before the reign of Ogyges unknown, <a id="l527"></a>because they had no history of them; those between his flood &amp; the beginning of <a id="l528"></a>the Olympiads Fabulous, because their history was much mixed with poetical <a id="l529"></a>fables: &amp; those after the beginning of the Olympiads historical, because their <a id="l530"></a>history was free from such fables. The fabulous ages wanted a good chro<a id="l531"></a>nology, &amp; so also did the historical for the first 60 or 70 Olympiads.</p> 
<p id="par189">The Europeans had no chronology before the times of the Persian Empire. <a id="l532"></a>And whatsoever chronology they now have of ancienter times, hath been framed since <a id="l533"></a>by reasoning &amp; conjecture. In the beginning of that monarchy, Acusilaus made <a id="l534"></a>Phoroneus as old as Ogyges &amp; his flood, &amp; that flood 1020 years older then the <a id="l535"></a>first Olympiad, which is above 680 years older then the truth. And to make out <a id="l536"></a>this recconing his followers have encreased the reigns of kings in length &amp; num<a id="l537"></a>ber. Plutarch<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> tells us that the Philosophers anciently delivered their opinions <a id="l538"></a>in verse, as Orpheus, Hesiod, Parmenides, Xenophanes, Empedocles, Thales; but <a id="l539"></a>afterwards left off the use of verses; &amp; that Aristarchus, Timocharis, Aristillus, <a id="l540"></a>Hipparchus did not make Astronomy the more contemptible by describing it in <a id="l541"></a>prose, after Eudoxus, Hesiod, &amp; Thales had wrote of it in verse. Solon wrote<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> in verse, <a id="l542"></a>&amp; all the seven wise men were addicted to poetry, as Anaximenes<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> affirmed. Till those <a id="l543"></a>days the Greeks wrote only in verse, &amp; while they did so there could be no chronology <a id="l544"></a>nor any other history then such as was mixed with poetical fancies. Pliny<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> in <a id="l545"></a>recconing up the inventors of things, tells us that Pherecydes Syrius taught to compose <a id="l546"></a>discourses in prose in the reign of Cyrus, &amp; Cadmus Milesius to write history. And <a id="l547"></a>in <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> another place he saith that Cadmus Milesius was the first that wrote in Prose. <a id="l548"></a>Iosephus tells us<sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> that Cadmus Milesius &amp; Acusilaus were but a little before the ex<a id="l549"></a>pedition of the Persians against the Greeks. And Suidas<sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> calls Acusilaus a most ancient <a id="l550"></a>historian, &amp; saith that he wrote genealogies out of tables of brass which his father, as was <a id="l551"></a>reported, found in a corner of his house. Who hid them there may be doubted. For the <a id="l552"></a>Greeks<sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> had no publick table or inscription older then the laws of Draco. Pherecydes Athe<a id="l553"></a>niensis in the reign of Darius Hystaspis, or soon after, wrote of the antiquities &amp; ancient <a id="l554"></a>genealogies of the Athenians in ten books, &amp; was one of the first European writers of this <a id="l555"></a>kind, &amp; one of the best, whence he had the name of Genealogus; &amp; by Dionysius<sup>i</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> Halicar<a id="l556"></a>nassensis is said to be second to none of the genealogers. Epimenides, not the philosopher <a id="l557"></a>but an historian, wrote also of the ancient genealogies. And Hellanicus who was twelve <a id="l558"></a>years older then Herodotus, digested his history by the ages or successions of the priestesses <a id="l559"></a>of Iuno Argiva. Others digested theirs by those  of the Archons of Athens, or kings <a id="l560"></a>of the Lacedemonians. Hippias the Elean published a breviary of the Olympiads supported <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> by no certain arguments as Plutarch<sup>k</sup><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> tells us. He lived in the 105<sup>th</sup> Olympiad <a id="l561"></a>&amp; was derided by Plato for his ignorance. This breviary seems to have contained <a id="l562"></a>nothing more then a short account of the victors in every Olympiad. Then <sup>l</sup><sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> Ephorus <a id="l563"></a>the disciple of Isocrates, formed a chronological history of Greece, beginning with <a id="l564"></a>the return of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus, &amp; ending with the siege of Perinthus <a id="l565"></a>in the twentith year of Philip the father of Alexander the great, that is, eleven <a id="l566"></a>years before the fall of the Persian empire. But <sup>m</sup><sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> he digested things by generations, <a id="l567"></a>&amp; the recconing by the Olympiads, or by any other Æra, was not yet in use a<a id="l568"></a>mong the Greeks. The Arundelian Marbles were composed sixty years after <a id="l569"></a>the death of Alexander the great (An. 4 Olymp. 128) &amp; yet mention not the <a id="l570"></a>Olympiads nor any other standing Æra, but reccon backwards from the time then <a id="l571"></a>present. But Chronology was now reduced to a recconing by years. And in the next <a id="l572"></a>Olympiad Timæus Siculus improved it. For he wrote a history in several <a id="l573"></a>books down to his own times according to the Olympiads; comparing the Ephori, <a id="l574"></a>the kings of Sparta, the Archons of Athens, &amp; the Priestesses of Argos with <a id="l575"></a>the Olympic victors, so as to make the Olympiads &amp; the Genealogies &amp; succes<a id="l576"></a>sions of kings &amp; priestesses &amp; the poetical histories suit with one another ac <a id="l577"></a>cording to the best of his judgment. And where he left off, Polybius began &amp; <a id="l578"></a>carried on the history. Eratosthenes wrote above an hundred years after the <a id="l579"></a>death of Alexander the great. He was followed by Apollodorus; &amp; these two have <a id="l580"></a>been followed ever since by Chronologers.</p> 
<p id="par190">But how uncertain their chronology is, &amp; how doubtful it was <a id="l581"></a>reputed by the Greeks of those times, may be understood by these passages <a id="l582"></a>of Plutarch. <em class="underline">Some reccon Lycurgus</em>, saith he,<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup> <em class="underline">contemporary to Iphitus, &amp; to have <a id="l583"></a>been his companion in ordering the Olympic festivals, amongst whom was Aristotel <a id="l584"></a>the philosopher; arguing from the Olympic Disc  which had the name of Lycurgus upon <a id="l585"></a>it. Others supputing the times by the Kings of Lacedemon, as Eratosthenes &amp; Apol<a id="l586"></a>lodorus, affirm that he was not a few years older then the first Olympiad</em>. He <a id="l587"></a>began to flourish in the 17<sup>th</sup> or 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, &amp; at length Aristotel made <a id="l588"></a>him as old as the first Olympiad, &amp; so did Epaminondas as he is cited by Elien &amp; Plutarch &amp; then Eratosthenes, Apollodorus &amp; their <a id="l589"></a>followers made him above an hundred years older. And in another place <a id="l590"></a>Plutarch <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup> tells us: <em class="underline">The congress of Solon with Crœsus some think they can <a id="l591"></a>confute by Chronology. But a history so illustrious, &amp; verified by so many wit<a id="l592"></a>nesses, &amp; which is more, so agreeable to the manners of Solon, &amp; worthy of the <a id="l593"></a>greatnes of his mind &amp; of his wisdome, I cannot perswade my self to reject be<a id="l594"></a>cause of</em>  <em class="underline">some chronological canons, as they call them, which <a id="l595"></a>hundreds of authors correcting have not yet been able to constitute any thing <a id="l596"></a>certain in which they could agree  amongst themselves about repugnancies</em>.</p> 
<p id="par191">And as for the chronology of the Latines that is still more uncertain. <a id="l597"></a>Plutarch <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup> represents great uncertainties in the originals of Rome, &amp; so doth <a id="l598"></a>Servius<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup>. The old records of the Latines were burnt <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup> by the Gauls an hundred <a id="l599"></a>&amp; twenty years after the regifuge &amp; sixty four years before the death of <a id="l600"></a>Alexander the great. And Quintus Fabius Pictor <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> the oldest historian of <a id="l601"></a>the Latines, lived an hundred years later then that king, &amp; took almost <a id="l602"></a>all things from Diocles Peparæthius a Greek. And the chronologers of Gallia <a id="l603"></a>Spain, Germany, Scythia, Swedeland, Britain &amp; Ireland are of a date still <a id="l604"></a>later. For Scythia beyond the Danube had no letters till Vlphilas their <a id="l605"></a>Bishop formed them: which was about six hundred years after the <a id="l606"></a>death of Alexander the great. And Germany had none till it received them <a id="l607"></a>from the western empire of the Latines above seven hundred years after the <a id="l608"></a>death of that king. The Hunns had none in the days of Procopius who flourish<a id="l609"></a>ed 850 years after the death of that king. And Sweden &amp; Norway received <a id="l610"></a>them still later. And things said to be done above one or two hundred years before <a id="l611"></a>the use of letters are of little credit.</p> 
<p id="par192">Diodorus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> in the beginning of his history tells us that he did not de<a id="l612"></a>fine by any certain space the times preceding the Trojan war because <a id="l613"></a>he had no certain foundation to rely upon: but from the Trojan war, <a id="l614"></a>according to the recconing of Apollodorus whom he followed, there were <a id="l615"></a>eighty years to the return of the Heraclides into Peloponesus, &amp; that from <a id="l616"></a>that period to the first Olympiad there were three hundred &amp; twenty eight <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015r"> &lt;15r&gt; </span> years, computing the times from the kings of the Lacedemonians. <a id="l617"></a>Apollodorus followed Eratosthenes, &amp; both of them followed Thucydi<a id="l618"></a>des in recconing eighty years from the Trojan war to the return <a id="l619"></a>of the Heraclides. But in recconing 328 years from that return <a id="l620"></a>to the first Olympiad Diodorus tells us that the times were computed <a id="l621"></a>from the kings of the Lacedemonians; &amp; Plutarch <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup> tells us that Apol<a id="l622"></a>lodorus, Eratosthenes &amp; others followed that computation. And since <a id="l623"></a>this recconing is still received by Chronologers, &amp; was gathered by <a id="l624"></a>computing the times from the kings of the Lacedemonians, that is <a id="l625"></a>from their number; let us re-examin that computation.</p> 
<p id="par193">The Egyptians recconed the reigns of kings equipollent to gene<a id="l626"></a>rations of men, &amp; three generations to an hundred years, as above; &amp; <a id="l627"></a>so did the Greeks &amp; Latines: &amp; accordingly they have made their kings <a id="l628"></a>reign one with another thirty &amp; three years a piece, &amp; above. For they <a id="l629"></a>make the seven kings of Rome who preceded the Consuls to have reigned <a id="l630"></a>244 years which is 35 years a piece. And the first twelve kings of Sicyon (Ægialeus, Europs, &amp;c.) to have reigned 529 years, which is 44 years a piece. And the <a id="l631"></a>first eight kings of Argos (Inachus, Phoroneus, &amp;c.) to have reigned 371 <a id="l632"></a>years, which is above 46 years a piece. And between the return of the <a id="l633"></a>Heraclides into Peloponesus &amp; the end of the first Messenian war, the <a id="l634"></a>ten kings of Sparta in one race (Eurysthenes, Agis, Echestratus, Labotas, <a id="l635"></a>Doriagus, Agesilaus, Archelaus, Teleclus, Alcamenes &amp; Polydorus,) the <a id="l636"></a>nine in the other race (Procles, Sous, Euripon, Prytanis, Eunomus, Poly<a id="l637"></a>dectes, Charilaus, Nicander, Theopompus,) the ten kings of Messene (Cres<a id="l638"></a>phontes, Epytus, Glaucus, Isthmius, Dotadas, Sibotas, Phintas, Antiochus, Euphaes, <a id="l639"></a>Aristodemus,) &amp; the nine of Arcadia (Cypselus, Olæas, Buchalion, Phialus, <a id="l640"></a>Simus, Pompus, Ægineta, Polymnestor, Æchmis) according to Chronologers, <a id="l641"></a>took up 379 years: which is 38 years a piece to the ten kings &amp; 42 years <a id="l642"></a>a piece to the nine. And the five kings of the race of Eurysthenes <a id="l643"></a>between the end of the first Messenian war &amp; the beginning of the reign <a id="l644"></a>of Darius Hystaspis (Eurycrates, Anaxander, Eurycrates II, Leon, Anaxan<a id="l645"></a>drides) reigned 202 years, which is above 40 years a piece.</p> 
<p id="par194">Thus the Greek chronologers who follow Timæus &amp; Eratosthenes <a id="l646"></a>have made the kings of their several cities who lived before the times of <a id="l647"></a>the Persian empire, to reign about 35 or 40 years a piece one with another <a id="l648"></a>which is a length so much beyond the course of nature as is not to be credited. <a id="l649"></a>For by the ordinary course of nature kings reign one with another about <a id="l650"></a>eighteen or twenty years a piece. And if in some instances they reign one <a id="l651"></a>with another five or six years longer, in others they reign as much shorter. <a id="l652"></a>Eighteen or twenty years is a medium. So the eighteen kings of Iudah who <a id="l653"></a>succeeded Solomon, reigned 390 years, which is one with another 22 years a <a id="l654"></a>piece. The fifteen kings of Israel after Solomon reigned 259 years which <a id="l655"></a>is 17<span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-6" style="width: 0.712em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.709em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.353em, 1000.71em, 3.051em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-7"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-8"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.474em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.3em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -4.426em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-9" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">1</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.323em, 1000.33em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -3.585em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-10" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">4</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1000.47em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 0.474em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.46em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.397em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-2"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn> <mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></script> years a piece.

Generations from father to son may be recconed one with another at <a id="l670"></a>about 33 or 34 years a piece or about three generations to an hundred <a id="l671"></a>years. But if the recconing proceed by the eldest sons, they are shorter so <a id="l672"></a>that three of them may be recconed at about 75 or 80 years. And the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span> reigns of kings are still shorter because kings are succeeded not only <a id="l673"></a>by their eldest sons but sometimes by their brothers, &amp; sometimes they are <a id="l674"></a>slain or deposed &amp; succeeded by others of an equal or greater age, especially <a id="l675"></a>in elective or turbulent kingdomes. And in the later ages since chronology <a id="l676"></a>hath been exact, there is scarce an instance to be found of ten kings reign<a id="l677"></a>ing  any where in continual succession above 260 years. But <a id="l678"></a>Timæus &amp; his followers (&amp; I think also some of his predecessors after the <a id="l679"></a>example of the Egyptians) have taken the reigns of kings for generations <a id="l680"></a>&amp; recconed three generations to an hundred &amp; sometimes to an hundred &amp; <a id="l681"></a>twenty years, &amp; founded the technical chronology of the Greeks upon this <a id="l682"></a>way of recconing. Let the recconing be reduced to the course of nature <a id="l683"></a>by putting the reigns of kings one with another at about eighteen or <a id="l684"></a>twenty years a piece: &amp; the ten kings of Sparta by one race, the nine <a id="l685"></a>by another race, the ten kings of Messene &amp; the nine of Arcadia above <a id="l686"></a>mentioned between the return of the Heraclides into Peloponesus &amp; the <a id="l687"></a>end of the first Messenian warr, will scarce take up above 180 or 190 years: <a id="l688"></a>whereas according to chronologers they took up 379 years.</p>
<p id="par195">For confirming this recconing I may add another argument. <a id="l689"></a>Euryleon the son of Ægeus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup> commanded the main body of the Messenians <a id="l690"></a>in the fift year of the first Messenian war, &amp; was in the fift genera<a id="l691"></a>tion from Oiolicus the son of Theras the brother in law of Aristodemus <a id="l692"></a>&amp; tutor to his sons Eurysthenes &amp; Procles, as Pausanias <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup> relates. And <a id="l693"></a>by consequence, from the return of the Heraclides, which was in the days <a id="l694"></a>of Theras, to the battel which was in the fift year of this war, there were <a id="l695"></a>six generations, which as I conceive being for the most part by the eldest <a id="l696"></a>sons, will scarce exceed thirty years to a generation &amp; so may amount unto <a id="l697"></a>170 or 180 years. That war lasted 19 or 20 years. Add the last 15 <a id="l698"></a>years, &amp; there will be about 190 years to the end of that warr: <a id="l699"></a>whereas the followers of Timæus make it about 379 years,  which is above sixty years to a generation.</p> 
<p id="par196">By these arguments Chronologers have lengthned the time between the <a id="l701"></a>return of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus &amp; the first Messenian war, <a id="l702"></a>adding to it about 190 years. And they have also lengthned the time between <a id="l703"></a>that war &amp; the rise of the Persian Empire. For in the race of the Spartan <a id="l704"></a>kings descended from Eurysthenes, after Polydorus reigned <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n26-ref">[26]</sup> these kings, Eury<a id="l705"></a>crates, Anaxander, Eurycratides, Leon, Anaxandrides, Cleomenes, Leonidas &amp;c <a id="l706"></a>&amp; in the other race descended from Procles, after Theopompus reigned <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n27-ref">[27]</sup> these, <a id="l707"></a>Anaxandrides, Archidemus, Anaxileus, Leutichides, Hippocratides, <a id="l708"></a>Ariston, Demaratus, Leutichides II &amp;c according to <sup>b</sup> Herodotus. These <a id="l709"></a>kings reigned till the sixt year of Xerxes in which Leonidas was slain <a id="l710"></a>by the Persians at Thermopylæ, &amp; Leutichides II soon after, flying from <a id="l711"></a>Sparta to Tegea, dyed there. The seven reigns of the kings of Sparta <a id="l712"></a>which follow Polydorus being added to the ten reigns above mentioned which <a id="l713"></a>began with that of Eurysthenes, make up seventeen reigns of kings be<a id="l714"></a>tween the return of the Heraclides into Peloponesus &amp; the sixt <a id="l715"></a>year of Xerxes. And the eight reigns following Theopompus being <a id="l716"></a>added to the nine reigns above mentioned which began with that of <a id="l717"></a>Procles, make up also seventeen reigns. And these seventeen reigns <a id="l718"></a>at twenty years a piece one with another amount unto three <a id="l719"></a>hundred &amp; forty years. Count these 340 years upwards from the <a id="l720"></a>sixt year of Xerxes, &amp; one or two years more for the warr of <a id="l721"></a>the Heraclides &amp; reign of Aristodemus the father of Eurysthenes <a id="l722"></a>&amp; Procles: &amp; they will place the return of the Heraclides into Pelopon<a id="l723"></a>nesus, 159  years after the death of Solomon &amp; 46  years <a id="l724"></a>before the first Olympiad in which Coræbus was victor. But the follow<a id="l725"></a>ers of Timæus have placed this return two hundred &amp; eighty  <a id="l726"></a>years earlier. Now this being the computation upon which the Greeks as you have heard from Diodorus &amp; Plutarch, have founded <a id="l727"></a>the chronology of their kingdoms which were ancienter then the Persian empire, <a id="l728"></a>that chronology is to be rectified by shortening the times which preceded the death of Cyrus, <a id="l729"></a>in the proportion of almost two to one. For the times which follow the death of Cyrus <a id="l730"></a>are not much amiss.</p>

<p id="par197">The artificial chronologers have made Lycurgus the legislator as <a id="l731"></a>old as Iphitus the restorer of the Olympiads, &amp; Iphitus an hundred &amp; twelve <a id="l732"></a>years older then the first Olympiad. And to help out the hypothesis, they have feigned <a id="l733"></a>twenty eight Olympiads older then the first Olympiad, wherein Coræbus was victor: <a id="l734"></a>But these things were feigned after the days of Thucydides &amp; Plato.

Count three hundred years back from the end of <a id="l742"></a>the Peloponesian war, &amp; they will place the legislature of Lycurgus upon the <a id="l743"></a>19<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. And according to Socrates  it might be upon the 22<sup>d</sup> or 23<sup>d</sup>. <a id="l744"></a>Athenæus <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup> tells us out of ancient authors (Hellanicus, Sosimus &amp; Hieronymus) <a id="l745"></a>that Lycurgus the Legislator was contemporary to Terpander the Musitian, &amp; that <a id="l746"></a>Terpander  was the first man who got the victory in the Carnea <a id="l747"></a>in a solemnity of music instituted in those festivals in the 26<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. <a id="l748"></a>He overcame four times in those Pythic games, &amp; therefore lived at least till <a id="l749"></a>the 29<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. And beginning to flourish in the days of Lycurgus, it is not <a id="l750"></a>likely that Lycurgus began to flourish much before the 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. The <a id="l751"></a>name of Lycurgus being on the Olympic Disk, Aristotel concluded thence <a id="l752"></a>that Lycurgus was the companion of Iphitus in restoring the Olympic games. And this argument might be the grownd of the opinion of Chronologers that <a id="l753"></a>Lycurgus &amp; Iphitus were contemporary. But Iphitus did not restore all the <a id="l754"></a>Olympic games. He <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup> restored the racing in the first Olympiad, Coræbus being victor. <a id="l755"></a>In the 14<sup>th</sup> Olympiad the double stadium was added, Hypænus being victor. And <a id="l756"></a>in the 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad the Quinquertium &amp; Wrastling were added Lampus &amp; <a id="l757"></a>Eurybatus (two Spartans) being Victors. And the Disk was one of the games of <a id="l758"></a>the Quinquertium. And Pausanias <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup> tells us that there were three Disks kept in <a id="l759"></a>the Olympic treasury at Altis. These therefore having the name of Lycurgus <a id="l760"></a>upon them, shew that they were  given by him at the institution of the <a id="l761"></a>Quinquertium in the 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. Now Polydectes king of Sparta being slain <a id="l762"></a>before the birth of his son Charillus or Charilaus, left the kingdom to Lycurgus <a id="l763"></a>his brother, &amp; Lycurgus upon the birth of Charillus became tutor to the child; <a id="l764"></a>&amp;  after about eight months travelled into Crete &amp; Asia till the child grew up, &amp; brought back <a id="l765"></a>with him the poems of Homer; &amp; soon after published his laws, suppose upon the <a id="l766"></a>22d or 23d Olympiad; for he was then growing old. And Terpander was a lyric poet <a id="l767"></a>&amp; began to flourish about this time. For <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup> he imitated Orpheus &amp; Homer &amp; sung <a id="l768"></a>Homers verses &amp; his own, &amp; wrote the laws of Lycurgus in verse, &amp; was victor <a id="l769"></a>in the Pythic games in the 26<sup>th</sup> Olympiad as above. He was the first who distin<a id="l770"></a>guished the modes of Lyric music by several names. Ardalus &amp; Clonas soon after <a id="l771"></a>did the like for wind music. And from hence forward, by the encouragement of <a id="l772"></a>the Pythic games now instituted, several eminent Musitians &amp; Poets flourished <a id="l773"></a>in Greece: as Archilochus, Eumelus Corinthius, Polymnestus, Thaletas, Xenodemus, <a id="l774"></a>Xenocritus, Sacadas, Tyrtæus, Tlesilla, Rhianus, Alcman, Arion, Stesichorus, <a id="l775"></a>Mimnermnus, Alcæus, Sappho, Theognis, Anacreon, Ibycus, Simonides, Æschylus, Pindar, <a id="l776"></a>by whom the Music &amp; Poetry of the Greeks were brought to perfection.</p> 
<p id="par198">Lycurgus published his laws in the reign of Agesilaus the son &amp; successor <a id="l777"></a>of Dorissus in the  race of the kings of Sparta descended from Eurysthenes. from the return of the Heraclides <a id="l778"></a>into Peloponesus to the end of the reign of Agesilaus there were six reigns. And from <a id="l779"></a>the same return to the end of the reign of Polydectes in the  race of the <a id="l780"></a>Spartan kings descended from Procles, there were also six reigns. And these reigns at twenty years <a id="l781"></a>a piece one with another amount unto 120 years, besides the short reign of Aristo<a id="l782"></a>demus, the father of Eurysthenes &amp; Procles, which might amount to a year or two. <a id="l783"></a>For Aristodemus came to the crown,  as <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> Herodotus &amp; the Lacedemonians themselves affirmed. The times of the <a id="l784"></a>  deaths of Agesilaus &amp; Polydectes are not certainly known: but it <a id="l785"></a>may be presumed that Lycurgus did not meddle with the Olympic games before he <a id="l786"></a>came to the  kingdom; &amp; therefore Polydectes dyed in the beginning of the 18<sup>th</sup> <a id="l787"></a>Olympiad or but a very little before. If it may be supposed that the 20<sup>th</sup> Olym<a id="l788"></a>piad was in or very neare to the middle time between the deaths of the two <a id="l789"></a>kings Polydectes &amp; Agesilaus, &amp; from thence be counted upwards the aforesaid 120 years, &amp; one <a id="l790"></a>year more for the reign of Aristodemus: the recconing will place the return <a id="l791"></a>of the Heraclides about 45 years before the beginning of the Olympiads.</p>

Hercules &amp; Andræ<a id="l793"></a>mon married two sisters. Thoas warred at Troy. Oxylus returned into Peloponesus with the Heraclides.

Count those years backwards from an. 2 Olymp 31 &amp; they will place <a id="l811"></a>the return of the Heraclides into Peloponesus  58 years before the first <a id="l812"></a>Olympiad.  But it might not be so early if the reign of Cypselus began three or <a id="l813"></a> four Olympiads later. For he reigned before the Persian empire began.</p> 
<p id="par201">Hercules the Argonaut was the father of Hyllus, the father of Cleodius, <a id="l814"></a>the father of Aristomachus, the father of Temenus, Cresphontes, &amp; Aristodemus <a id="l815"></a>who led the Heraclides into Peloponesus. And Eurystheus who was of the <a id="l816"></a>same age with Hercules, was slain in the first attempt of the Heraclides <a id="l817"></a>to return, Hyllus was slain in the second attempt, Cleodius in the third <a id="l818"></a>attempt, Aristomachus in the fourth attempt, &amp; Aristodemus died as soon <a id="l819"></a>as they were returned &amp; left the kingdom of Sparta to his sons Eurysthenes <a id="l820"></a>&amp; Procles. Whence their return was  four  <a id="l821"></a>generations later then the Argonautic expedition. And these generations <a id="l822"></a>were short ones being by the chief of the family, &amp; suit with the recconing <a id="l823"></a>of Thucydides &amp; the ancients that the taking of Troy was about 75 or eighty years <a id="l824"></a>before the return of the Heraclides into Peloponesus, &amp; the Argonautic expe<a id="l825"></a>dition one generation earlier then the taking of Troy. Count therefore <a id="l826"></a>eighty years backward from the return of the Heraclides into Peloponesus <a id="l827"></a>to the Trojan war: &amp; the taking of Troy will be about 76 years after the <a id="l828"></a>death of Solomon. And the Argonautic expedition which was one generation <a id="l829"></a>earlier, will be about 43 years after it. From the taking of Troy to the <a id="l830"></a>return of the Heraclides could scarce be more than eighty years, because <a id="l831"></a>Orestes the son of Agamemnon was a youth at the taking of Troy, &amp; his sons <a id="l832"></a>Penthilus &amp; Tisamenus lived till the return of the Heraclides.</p> 
<p id="par202">Æsculapius &amp; Hercules were Argonauts, &amp; Hippocrates was the eighteenth <a id="l833"></a>inclusively by the fathers side from Æsculapius, &amp; the nineteenth from Hercules by <a id="l834"></a>the mothers side. And because these generations being taken notice of by writers <a id="l835"></a>were most probably by the principal of the family &amp; so for the most part <a id="l836"></a>by the eldest sons, we may reccon about 28 or at the most about 30 years to <a id="l837"></a>a generation. And thus the seventeen intervalls by the fathers side, &amp; eighteen <a id="l838"></a>by the mothers, will at a middle recconing amount unto about 507 years: <a id="l839"></a>which counted backwards from the beginning of the Peloponesian war, at <a id="l840"></a>which time Hippocrates began to flourish, will reach up to the 43d year <a id="l841"></a>after the death of Solomon, &amp; there place the Argonautic expedition.</p>

<p id="par205">The expedition of Sesostris was one generation earlier then the Argonautic expedi<a id="l871"></a>tion. For in his return back into Egypt he left Æetes at Colchos, &amp; Æetes reigned there till <a id="l872"></a>the Argonautic expedition; &amp; Prometheus was left by Sesostris with a body of men at mount <a id="l873"></a>Caucasus to guard that pass, &amp; after thirty years <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>was<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> released by Hercules the Argonaut. And <a id="l874"></a>Phlyas &amp; Eumedon the sons of the great Bacchus (so the poets call Sesostris) &amp; of Ariadne <a id="l875"></a>the daughter of Minos, were Argonauts. At the return of Sesostris into Egypt, his <a id="l876"></a>brother Danaus fled from him into Greece with his fifty daughters in a long ship, after <a id="l877"></a>the pattern of which the ship Argo was built: &amp; Argus the son of Danaus was the master <a id="l878"></a>builder thereof. And Nauplius the Argonaut was born in Greece of Amymone one of <a id="l879"></a>the daughters of Danaus &amp; of Neptune the brother &amp; admiral of Sesostris. And two <a id="l880"></a>others of the daughters of Danaus married Archander &amp; Archilites the sons of Achæus <a id="l881"></a>the son of Creusa the daughter of Erechtheus king of Athens. And therefore the daugh<a id="l882"></a>ters of Danaus were three generations younger then Erechtheus, &amp; by consequence <a id="l883"></a>contemporary to Theseus the son of Ægeus the adopted son of Pandion the son of <a id="l884"></a>Erechtheus. And Theseus in the time of the Argonautic expedition was of about <a id="l885"></a>50 years of age, &amp; so was born about the 33d year of Solomon. For he stole <a id="l886"></a>Helena <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n42-ref">[42]</sup> just before that expedition being then 50 years old &amp; she but seven <a id="l887"></a>or as some say ten. Perithous the son of Ixion helped Theseus to steale Helena <a id="l888"></a>&amp; then <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n43-ref">[43]</sup> Theseus went with Perithous to steale Proserpina the daughter of Aidoneus <a id="l889"></a>King of Molossus, &amp; was taken in the action. And whilst he lay in prison, Castor <a id="l890"></a>&amp; Pollux returning from the Argonautic expedition, released their sister Helena <a id="l891"></a>&amp; captivated Æthra the mother of Theseus. Now the daughters of Danaus being <a id="l892"></a>contemporary to Theseus, &amp; some of their sons being Argonauts, Danaus with his <a id="l893"></a>daughters fled from his brother Sesostris into Greece about one generation before the <a id="l894"></a>Argonautic expedition, &amp; therefore Sesostris returned into Egypt in the reign of Re<a id="l895"></a>hoboam. He came out of Egypt in the fift year of Rehoboam  &amp; <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n44-ref">[44]</sup> spent nine years in that expedition against the eastern nations &amp; Greece, <a id="l896"></a>&amp; therefore returned back into Egypt in the fourteenth year of Rehoboam. Sesac <a id="l897"></a>&amp; Sesostris were therefore kings of all Egypt at one &amp; the same time. And they <a id="l898"></a>agree not only in the time but also in their actions &amp; conquests. God gave Sesac <a id="l899"></a>הארצות ממלכות <em class="underline">the kingdoms of the lands</em>. 2 Chron. 12. Where Herodotus describes <a id="l900"></a>the expedition of Sesostris, Iosephus <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n45-ref">[45]</sup> tells us that he described the expedition of Sesac <a id="l901"></a>&amp; attributed his actions to Sesostris, erring only in the name of the king. Corruptions <a id="l902"></a>of names are frequent in history. Sesostris was otherwise called Sesochris, Sesochis, <a id="l903"></a>Sesoosis, Sethosis, Sesonchis, Sesonchosis. Take away the Greek termination, &amp; the <a id="l904"></a>names become Sesost, Sesoch, Sesoos, Sethos, Sesonch: which names differ very little <a id="l905"></a>from Sesach. Sesonchis &amp; Sesach differ no more then Memphis &amp; Moph, two names <a id="l906"></a>of the same city. Iosephus <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n46-ref">[46]</sup> tells us also from Manetho that Sethosis was the brother <a id="l907"></a>of Armais, &amp; that these brothers were otherwise called Ægyptus &amp; Danaus, &amp; that <a id="l908"></a>upon the return of Sethosis or Ægyptus from his great conquests into Ægypt, Armais or <a id="l909"></a>Danaus fled from him into Greece.</p> 
<p id="par206">Ægypt was at first divided into many small kingdoms like other nations, &amp; grew <a id="l910"></a>into one monarchy by degrees. And the father of Solomons Queen was the first King of Egypt <a id="l911"></a>who came into Phenicia with an army. But he only took Gezir &amp; gave it to his daughter. <a id="l912"></a>Sesac the next king came out of Egypt with an army of Libyans Troglodites &amp; Ethiopians  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span> (2 Chron. 12. 3) &amp; therefore was then king of all those countries; &amp; we do not read <a id="l913"></a>in scripture that any former king of Egypt who reigned over all those nations, came <a id="l914"></a>out of Egypt with a great army to conquer other countries. The sacred history of <a id="l915"></a>the Israelites from the days of Abraham to the days of Solomon admits of no such <a id="l916"></a>conqueror. Sesostris reigned over all the same nations of the Libyans Troglodites &amp; <a id="l917"></a>Ethiopians, &amp; came out of Egypt with a great army to conquer other kingdoms. The <a id="l918"></a>shepherds reigned long in the lower part of Egypt &amp; were expelled thence just be<a id="l919"></a>fore the building of Ierusalem &amp; the Temple according to Manetho; &amp; whilst <a id="l920"></a>they reigned in the lower part of Egypt, the upper part thereof was under other <a id="l921"></a>kings. And while Egypt was divided into several kingdoms, there was no room <a id="l922"></a>for any such king of all Egypt as Sesostris; &amp; no historian makes him later then <a id="l923"></a>Sesac. And therefore he was one &amp; the same king of Egypt with Sesac. This is no <a id="l924"></a>new opinion. Iosephus discovered it when he affirmed that Herodotus erred in ascrib<a id="l925"></a>ing the actions of Sesac to Sesostris, &amp; that the error was only in the name of the <a id="l926"></a>king. For this is as much as to say that the true name of him who did those things <a id="l927"></a>described by Herodotus was Sesac, &amp; that Herodotus erred only in calling him Se<a id="l928"></a>sostris; or that he was called Sesostris by a corruption of his name. Our great <a id="l929"></a>Chronologer, Sir Iohn Marsham was also of opinion that Sesostris was Sesac. And if <a id="l930"></a>this be granted, it is then most certain that Sesostris came out of Egypt in the fift year <a id="l931"></a>of Rehoboam to invade the nations, &amp; returned back into Egypt in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of that <a id="l932"></a>king; &amp; that Danaus then flying from his brother came into Greece within a year or two after. And the Argonautic <a id="l933"></a>expedition being one generation later then that invasion, &amp; then the coming of Danaus <a id="l934"></a>into Greece, was certainly about 40 or 45 years later then the death of Solomon. Prometheus <a id="l935"></a>stayd on Mount Caucasus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n47-ref">[47]</sup> thirty years, &amp; then was released by Hercules: &amp; therefore the Argo<a id="l936"></a>nautic expedition was thirty years after Prometheus had been left on mount Caucasus by <a id="l937"></a>Sesostris, that is, about 44 years after the death of Solomon.</p> 
<p id="par207">All nations before the just length of the solar year was known, recconed months by the <a id="l938"></a>course of the moon, &amp; years by the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n48-ref">[48]</sup> returns of winter &amp; summer spring &amp; autumn.

Whence came the <a id="l941"></a>division of the ecliptic into 360 degrees. So in the time of Noah's flood when the Moon <a id="l942"></a>could not be seen, Noah recconed thirty days to a month.

<p id="par208">The ancient Calendar year of the Greeks consisted therefore of twelve Lunar <a id="l967"></a>months, &amp; every month of thirty days: &amp; these years &amp; months they corrected from time to <a id="l968"></a>time by the courses of the Sun &amp; Moon, omitting a day or two in the month as often <a id="l969"></a>as they found the month too long for the course of the Moon, &amp; adding a month to the <a id="l970"></a>year as often as they found the twelve Lunar months too short for the return of the <a id="l971"></a>four seasons. Cleobulus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> one of the seven wise men of Greece alluded to this year of the <a id="l972"></a>Greeks in his Parable of one father who had twelve sons, each of which had thirty daughters <a id="l973"></a>half white &amp; half black. And Thales <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n54-ref">[54]</sup> called the last day of the month τριακάδα the thirtith. And Solon counted the ten last days of the month backward from the thirtith, calling that day <a id="l974"></a>ενην καὶ νέαν, the old &amp; the new, or the last day of the old month &amp; the first day of the new. For he introduced months of 29 &amp; 30 days alternately, making the thirtith day of every <a id="l975"></a>other month to be the first day of the next month.</p> 
<p id="par209">To the twelve Lunar months <sup>a
</sup><sup class="note" id="n55-ref">[55]</sup> the ancient Greeks added a thirteenth every other  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021r"> &lt;21r&gt; </span> year, which made their Dicteris. And because this recconing made their year too long by <a id="l976"></a>a month in eight yeares, they omitted an intercalary month once in eight years which made their <a id="l977"></a>Octaeteris, one half of which was their Tetraeteris. And these Periods seem to have been almost <a id="l978"></a>as old as the religions of Greece, being used in divers of their sacra. The <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n56-ref">[56]</sup> Octaeteris was the Annus <a id="l979"></a>magnus of Cadmus &amp; Minos, &amp; seems to have been brought into Greece &amp; Crete by the Phenicians <a id="l980"></a>who came thither with Cadmus &amp; Europa, &amp; to have continued till after the days of Herodotus. For in counting the length of seventy years, <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n57-ref">[57]</sup> he reccons thirty days to a Lunar month &amp; twelve <a id="l981"></a>such months or 360 days to the ordinary year without the intercalary months, &amp; 25 such months <a id="l982"></a>to the Dieteris. And according to the number of days in the calendar year of the Greeks, Demetrius <a id="l983"></a>Phalereus had 360 statues erected to him by the Athenians. But the Greeks Cleostratus, Harpa<a id="l984"></a>lus, &amp; others, to make their months agree better with the course of the Moon, in the times <a id="l985"></a>of the Persian empire varied the manner of intercaling the three months in the Octaeteris, <a id="l986"></a>&amp; Meton found out the cycle of intercaling seven months in nineteen years.</p> 
<p id="par210">So The Ancient year of the Latines was also Lunisolar. For Plutarch <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n58-ref">[58]</sup> tells us that <a id="l987"></a>the year of Numa consisted of twelve Lunar months, with intercalary months to make up what the <a id="l988"></a>twelve Lunar months wanted of the Solar year. The ancient year of the Egyptians was also Lu<a id="l989"></a>nisolar, &amp; continued to be so till the days of Hyperion or Osiris a king of Egypt, the father <a id="l990"></a>of Helius &amp; Selenæ or Orus &amp; Bubaste. For the Israelites brought this year out of <a id="l991"></a>Egypt, &amp; Diodorus tells <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n59-ref">[59]</sup> us that Vranus the father of Hyperion used this year, &amp; <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n60-ref">[60]</sup> that <a id="l992"></a>in the temple of Osiris the priests appointed thereunto filled 360 milk bowles every <a id="l993"></a>day. I think he means one bowle every day, in all 360 to count the number of days <a id="l994"></a>in the Calendar year, &amp; thereby to find out the difference between this &amp; the true <a id="l995"></a>solar year. For the year of 360 days was the year to the end of which they added five days.</p> 
<p id="par211">That the Israelites used the Lunisolar year is beyond question. Their months <a id="l996"></a>began with their new moons. Their first month was called Abib from the earing of <a id="l997"></a>corn in that month. Their passover was kept upon the fourteenth day of the first <a id="l998"></a>Month, the Moon being then in the full. And if the corn was not then ripe enough for <a id="l999"></a>offering the first fruits, the festival was put of by adding an intercalary month to <a id="l1000"></a>the end of the year; &amp; the harvest was got in before the  <a id="l1001"></a>Pentecost, &amp; the other fruits gathered before the feast of the seventh month.</p> 
<p id="par212">Simplicius in his commentary <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n61-ref">[61]</sup> on the fift of Aristotels Physical Acroasis <a id="l1002"></a>tells us that <em>some begin</em> the year upon <em>the summer solstice as the people of Attica; or upon the <a id="l1003"></a>autumnal Equinox as the people of Asia; or in winter as the Romans; or about <a id="l1004"></a>the vernal Equinox as the Arabians &amp; people of Damascus. And the month be<a id="l1005"></a>gan according to some upon the full Moon or upon the new</em>. The years of all these <a id="l1006"></a>nations were therefore Lunisolar, &amp; kept to the four seasons. And the Roman year <a id="l1007"></a>began at first in spring, as I seem to gather from the names of their months, Quin<a id="l1008"></a>tilis, Sextilis, September, October, November, December. And the beginning was <a id="l1009"></a>afterwards removed to winter. The ancient civil year of the Assyrians &amp; Baby<a id="l1010"></a>lonians was also Lunisolar. For this year was also used by the Samaritans who <a id="l1011"></a>came from several parts of the Assyrian empire. And the Iews who came from Babylon <a id="l1012"></a>called the months of their Lunisolar year after the names of the months of the Babylo<a id="l1013"></a>nian year. And Berosus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n62-ref">[62]</sup> tells us that the Babylonians celebrated the feast Sacæa <a id="l1014"></a>upon the 16<sup>th</sup> day of the month Lous, which was a lunar month of the Macedonians, <a id="l1015"></a>&amp; kept to one &amp; the same season of the year. And the Arabians, a nation who <a id="l1016"></a>peopled Babylon, use Lunar months to this day. And Suidas <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n63-ref">[63]</sup> tells us that the Sarus of <a id="l1017"></a>the Chaldeans contains 222 Lunar months which are eighteen years consisting each <a id="l1018"></a>of twelve Lunar months besides six intercalary months. And when <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n64-ref">[64]</sup> Cyrus cut the <a id="l1019"></a>river Gindus into 360 channels, he seems to have alluded unto the number of days <a id="l1020"></a>in the Calendar year of the Medes &amp; Persians. And the Emperor Iulian <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n65-ref">[65]</sup> writes: For when all other people (that I may say it <a id="l1021"></a>in one word) accommodate their months to the course of the Moon, we alone <a id="l1022"></a>with the Egyptians measure the days of the year by the course of the Sun.</p> 
<p id="par213">At length the Egyptians for the sake of navigation applied themselves to observe <a id="l1023"></a>the starrs, &amp; by their heliacal risings &amp; settings found the true solar year to be five days <a id="l1024"></a>  longer then the calendar year, &amp; therefore added five days to the twelve calendar <a id="l1025"></a>months, making the solar year to consist of twelve months &amp; five days. Strabo <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n66-ref">[66]</sup> &amp; Diodorus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n67-ref">[67]</sup> <a id="l1026"></a>ascribe this invention to the Egyptians of Thebes. <em class="underline">The Theban priests</em>, saith <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n68-ref">[68]</sup> Strabo, <em class="underline">are <a id="l1027"></a>above others said to be astronomers &amp; philosophers.

In memory of this emendation of the year they <a id="l1030"></a>dedicated the <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n69-ref">[69]</sup> five additional days to Osiris, Isis, Orus senior, Typhon &amp; Nephthe the <a id="l1031"></a>wife of Typhon, feigning that those days were added to the year when these five Princes <a id="l1032"></a>were born, that is, in the reign of Ouranus or Ammon the father of Sesac. And in <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n70-ref">[70]</sup> the <a id="l1033"></a>sepulchre of Amenophis who reigned soon after, they placed a golden circle of 365 cubits <a id="l1034"></a>in compass &amp; divided it into 365 equal parts to represent all the days in the year, &amp; noted <a id="l1035"></a>upon each part the heliacal risings &amp; settings of the starrs on that day; which circle remain<a id="l1036"></a>ed there till the invasion of Egypt by Cambyses king of Persia. Till the reign of Ouranus <a id="l1037"></a>the father of Hyperion &amp; grandfather of Helio &amp; Selene the Egyptians used the old Luni-<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022r"> &lt;22r&gt; </span>solar year: but in his reign, that is, in the reign of Ammon the father of Osiris or <a id="l1038"></a>Sesac &amp; grandfather of Orus &amp; Bubaste, the Thebans began to apply themselves to Na<a id="l1039"></a>vigation &amp; Astronomy, &amp; by the heliacal risings &amp; settings of the starrs determined <a id="l1040"></a>the length of the solar year, &amp; to the old calendar year added five days, &amp; dedicated <a id="l1041"></a>them to his five children above mentioned as their birth days. And in the reign of <a id="l1042"></a>Amenophis, when by further observations they had sufficiently determined the <a id="l1043"></a>time of the solstices, they might place the beginning of this new year upon the <a id="l1044"></a>vernal equinox. And this year being at length propagated into Chaldea gave <a id="l1045"></a>occasion to the year of Nabonassar. For the years of Nabonassar &amp; those of <a id="l1046"></a>Egypt began on one &amp; the same day called by them Thoth, &amp; were equal &amp; in all <a id="l1047"></a>respects the same. And the first year of Nabonassar began on the 26<sup>th</sup> day of <a id="l1048"></a>February of the old Roman year, seven hundred forty &amp; seven years before <a id="l1049"></a>the vulgar Æra of Christ, &amp; thirty &amp; three days &amp; five hours before the <a id="l1050"></a>vernal equinox according to the suns mean motion. For it is not likely that <a id="l1051"></a>the equation of the suns motion should be known in the infancy of Astronomy. <a id="l1052"></a>Now recconing that the year of 365 days wants five hours &amp; 49 minutes of <a id="l1053"></a>the equinoctial year: the beginning of this year will move backwards thirty <a id="l1054"></a>&amp; three days &amp; five hours in 137 years: And by consequence this year began <a id="l1055"></a>at first in Egypt upon the Vernal equinox according to the sun's mean motion, <a id="l1056"></a>137 years before the Æra of Nabonassar began, that is, in the year of the Iu<a id="l1057"></a>lian Period 3830, or 96 years after the death of Solomon. And if it began <a id="l1058"></a>upon the next day after the vernal Equinox, it might begin four years earlier. <a id="l1059"></a>And about that time ended the reign of Amenophis. For he came not from Susa <a id="l1060"></a>to the Trojan war, but died afterwards in Egypt. This year was received <a id="l1061"></a>by the Persian Empire from the Babylonian; &amp; the Greeks also used it in the <a id="l1062"></a>Æra Philippæa dated from the death of Alexander the great, &amp; Iulius Cæsar <a id="l1063"></a>corrected it by adding a day in every four years, &amp; made it the year of the <a id="l1064"></a>Romans.</p> 
<p id="par214">Syncellus tells us that the five days were added to the old year by the <a id="l1065"></a>last king of the shepherds. And the difference in time betweenthe reign of this king <a id="l1066"></a>&amp; that of Ammon is but small. For the reign of the shepherds ended but <a id="l1067"></a>one generation or two before Ammon began to add those days. But the shepherds <a id="l1068"></a>minded not arts &amp; sciences.</p> 
<p id="par215">The first month of the Lunisolar year, by reason of the intercalary <a id="l1069"></a>month, began sometimes a week or a fortnight before the Equinox or solstice <a id="l1070"></a>&amp; sometimes as much after it. And this yeare gave occasion to the first Astrono<a id="l1071"></a>mers who formed the Asterisms to place the Equinoxes &amp; Solstices in the middles <a id="l1072"></a>of the constellations of Aries, Cancer, Chelæ, &amp; Capricorn. Achilles Tatius<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n71-ref">[71]</sup> tells us that <em class="underline">some antiently <a id="l1073"></a>placed the solstice in the beginning of Cancer,  others in the eighth degree of <a id="l1074"></a>Cancer, others about the twelft degree, &amp; others about the fifteenth degree <a id="l1075"></a>thereof</em>. This variety of opinions proceeded from the precession of the Equinox <a id="l1076"></a>then not known to the Greeks. When the sphere was first formed the solstice <a id="l1077"></a>was in the fifteenth degree or middle of the constellation of Cancer. Then it <a id="l1078"></a>came into the twelft, eighth, fourth &amp; first degree successively. Eudoxus <a id="l1079"></a>who flourished about sixty years after Meton &amp; an hundred years before <a id="l1080"></a>Aratus, in describing the sphere of the ancients, placed the solstices &amp; equi<a id="l1081"></a>noxes in the middles of the constellations of Aries, Cancer, Chelæ, &amp; Capricorn, <a id="l1082"></a>as is affirmed by<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n72-ref">[72]</sup> Hypparchus Bithynus &amp; appears also by the description of the <a id="l1083"></a>Equinoctial &amp; Tropical circles in Aratus<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n73-ref">[73]</sup> who coppied after Eudoxus, &amp; by the <a id="l1084"></a>positions of the Colures of the Equinoxes &amp; Solstices which in the sphere of Eu<a id="l1085"></a>doxus described by Hipparchus went through the middles of those constellations. <a id="l1086"></a>For Hipparchus tells us that Eudoxus drew the Colure of the solstices through <a id="l1087"></a>the middle of the great Bear, &amp; the middle of Cancer, &amp; the neck of Hydrus, &amp; the <a id="l1088"></a>star between the Poop &amp; mast of Argo, &amp; the tayl of the south fish, &amp; through the <a id="l1089"></a>middle of Capricorn, &amp; of Sagitta, &amp; through the neck &amp; right wing of the swan, &amp; <a id="l1090"></a>the left hand of Cepheus. And that he drew the equinoctial colure through the left <a id="l1091"></a>hand of Arctophylax, &amp; along the middle of his body, &amp; cross the middle of Chelæ, <a id="l1092"></a>&amp; through the right hand &amp; foreknee of the Centaur, &amp; through the flexure of <a id="l1093"></a>Eridanus &amp; head of Cetus, &amp; the back of Aries across, &amp; through the head &amp; right hand <a id="l1094"></a>of Perseus.</p> 
<p id="par216">Now Chiron delineated σχήματα ὀλύμπου the Asterisms, as the ancient <a id="l1095"></a>author of Gigantomachia cited by<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n74-ref">[74]</sup> Clemens Alexandrinus  informs us.

And the Sphere it self <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023r"> &lt;23r&gt; </span> shews that it was delineated in the time of the Argonautic expedition. For that expedition <a id="l1099"></a>is delineated in the Asterisms, together with several other ancienter histories of the Greeks, <a id="l1100"></a>&amp; without any thing later.

And they all relate to the Argonauts &amp; their contemporaries, &amp; to persons one <a id="l1116"></a>or two generations older. And nothing later than that Expedition was delineated there <a id="l1117"></a>originally. <em class="underline">Antinous</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Coma Berenices</em> are novel. The sphere seems therefore to <a id="l1118"></a>have been formed by Chiron &amp; Musæus for the use of the Argonauts. For the ship <a id="l1119"></a>Argo was the first long ship built by the Greeks. Hitherto they had used round vessels <a id="l1120"></a>of burden &amp; kept within sight of the shore; &amp; now upon an embassy to several princes <a id="l1121"></a>upon the coasts of the Euxine &amp; Mediterranean seas, <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n76-ref">[76]</sup> by the dictates of the Oracle &amp; consent <a id="l1122"></a>of the Princes of Greece, the flower of Greece were to sail with expedition through the <a id="l1123"></a>deep in a long ship with sails, &amp; guide their ship by the starrs. The people of the Island <a id="l1124"></a>Corcyra <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n77-ref">[77]</sup> attributed the invention of the sphere to Nusicae the daughter of Alcinous king <a id="l1125"></a>of the Pheaces in that island. And its most probable that she had it from the Argonauts <a id="l1126"></a>who <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n78-ref">[78]</sup> in their return home sailed to that Island, &amp; made some stay there with her father. <a id="l1127"></a>So then in the time of the Argonautic expedition, the cardinal points of the Equinoxes &amp; Solstices <a id="l1128"></a>were in the middles of the constellations of Aries, Cancer, Chelæ &amp; Capricorn.</p> 
<p id="par217">In the end of the year of our Lord 1689 the Star called prima Arietis was in <span class="ns">♈</span> . 28°. <a id="l1129"></a>51'. 00", with north Latitude 7°. 8'. 58".

And the Colurus Æquinoctiorum passing through <a id="l1131"></a>the point in the middle  between those two starrs did then cut the Ecliptic in <span class="ns">♉</span> . 6°. 44'. And by <a id="l1132"></a>this recconing the Equinox in the end of the year 1689 was gone back 36°. 44'. since the Argo<a id="l1133"></a>nautic expedition : supposing that the said Colure passed through the middle of the Constella<a id="l1134"></a>tion of Aries according to the delineation of the ancients.

<p id="par218">In the back of Aries is a star of the sixt magnitude marked <span class="greek">ν</span> by Bayer.

Its longitude in the end of the same year 1689 was <span class="ns">♒</span> <a id="l1175"></a>6°. 29'. 53".

<p id="par220">The two Colures therefore which in the time of the Argonautic Expedition cut <a id="l1184"></a>the Ecliptic in the cardinal points, did in the end of the year 1689 cut it in <span class="ns">♉</span> 6°. 29', <span class="ns">♌</span> 6°. 29', <a id="l1185"></a><span class="ns">♏</span> 6°. 29', &amp; <span class="ns">♒</span> 6° 29', that is, at the distance of 1 signe 6 degrees &amp; 29 minutes from <a id="l1186"></a>the cardinal points of Chiron, as nearely as we have been able to determin from the coarse ob<a id="l1187"></a>servations of the ancients. And therefore the cardinal points, in the time between <a id="l1188"></a>that expedition &amp; the end of the yeare 1689, have gone back from those Colures 1 <a id="l1189"></a>signe 6 degrees &amp; 29 minutes: which after the rate of 72 years to a degree <a id="l1190"></a>answers to 2627 years. Count those years backwards from the end of the year 1689, <a id="l1191"></a>or beginning  of the year 1690, &amp; the recconing will place the Argo<a id="l1192"></a>nautic Expedition about 43 years after the death of Solomon.</p> 
<p id="par221">And by the same method the place of any star in the primitive sphere may <a id="l1193"></a>readily be found by counting backwards 1 sign. 6°. 29'. from the longitude which it had <a id="l1194"></a>in the end of the year of our Lord 1689. So the longitude of the first starr of Aries <a id="l1195"></a>in the end of the year 1689 was <span class="ns">♈</span> 28° 51' as above. Count backward 1 sign 6°. 29' <a id="l1196"></a>&amp; its longitude counted from the equinox in the middle of the constellation of Aries <a id="l1197"></a>in the time of the Argonautic expedition will be <span class="ns">♓</span> 22°. 22'. And by the same way <a id="l1198"></a>of arguing the longitude of the Lucida Pleiadum in the time of the Argonautic Ex<a id="l1199"></a>pedition will be <span class="ns">♈</span> 19°. 26'. 8".

<p id="par222">After the Argonautic Expedition we hear no more of Astronomy till the <a id="l1201"></a>days of Thales. He<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n79-ref">[79]</sup> revived Astronomy &amp; wrote a book of the Tropics &amp; Equinoxes <a id="l1202"></a>&amp; predicted Eclipses; &amp; Pliny<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n80-ref">[80]</sup> tells us that he determined the occasus matutinus of the <a id="l1203"></a>Pleiades to be upon the 25<sup>t</sup> day after the autumnal Equinox. And thence <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n81-ref">[81]</sup> Petavius <a id="l1204"></a>computes the longitude of the Pleiades in <span class="ns">♈</span> 23°. 53'. And by consequence the Lucida <a id="l1205"></a>Pleiadum had since the Argonautic expedition moved from the Equinox 4°. 26'. 52". <a id="l1206"></a>And this motion after the rate of 72 years to a degree, answers to 320 years. <a id="l1207"></a>Count these years back from the time in which Thales was a young man fit to apply <a id="l1208"></a>himself to Astronomical studies, that is from about the 41<sup>th</sup> Olympiad: &amp; the rec<a id="l1209"></a>coning will place the Argonautic expedition about 44 years after the death of <a id="l1210"></a>Solomon as above. And in the days of Thales, the Solstices &amp; Equinoxes by this <a id="l1211"></a>recconing will have been in the middle of the eleventh degrees of the signes. But <a id="l1212"></a>Thales in publishing his book about the Tropics &amp; Equinoxes might lean a little <a id="l1213"></a>to the opinion of former Astronomers so as to place them in the twelft degrees <a id="l1214"></a>of the signes.</p> 
<p id="par223">Meton &amp; Euctemon<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n82-ref">[82]</sup> in order to publish the Lunar Cycle of nineteen years <a id="l1215"></a>observed the summer solstice in the year of Nabonassar 316, the year before the <a id="l1216"></a>Peloponesian war began, &amp; Columella<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n83-ref">[83]</sup> tells us that they placed it in the eighth degree <a id="l1217"></a>of Cancer which is at least seven degrees backwarder then at first. Now the Equinox <a id="l1218"></a>after the rate of a degree in seventy &amp; two years, goes backwards seven degrees in <a id="l1219"></a>504 years. Count backwards those years from the 316<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonassar, &amp; <a id="l1220"></a>the Argonautic Expedition will fall upon the 44<sup>th</sup> year after the death of Solomon, <a id="l1221"></a>or thereabout, as above. And thus you see the truth of what we cited above out of Achilles ‡<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the bottom of f 23v &gt; </span>‡ Tatius; videlicet, that some anciently placed the Solstice in the eighth degree of <a id="l1222"></a>Cancer, others about the twelfth degree  &amp; others about the fifteenth degree <a id="l1223"></a>thereof.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 24r resumes &gt; </span></p> 
<p id="par224">Hipparchus the great Astronomer comparing his own observations with <a id="l1224"></a>those of former Astronomers, concluded first of any man that the equinoxes had a <a id="l1225"></a>motion backwards in respect of the fixt starrs: &amp; his opinion was that they went backwards <a id="l1226"></a>one degree in about an hundred years. He made his observations of the equinoxes between <a id="l1227"></a>the years of Nabonassar 586 &amp; 618. The middle year is 602, which is 286 years after <a id="l1228"></a>the aforesaid observation of Meton &amp; Euctemon. And in these years the equinox must <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025r"> &lt;25r&gt; </span> have gone backwards four degrees &amp; so have been in the fourth degree <a id="l1229"></a>of Aries in the days of Hipparchus, &amp; by consequence have then gone back eleven <a id="l1230"></a>degrees since the Argonautick expedition, that is, in 1090 years according to the <a id="l1231"></a>chronology of the ancient Greeks then in use. And this is after the rate of about 99 <a id="l1232"></a>years, or in the next round number an hundred years to a degree, as was then stated <a id="l1233"></a>by Hipparchus. But it really went back a degree in seventy &amp; two years &amp; eleven <a id="l1234"></a>degrees in 792 years. Count these 792 years backward from the year of Nabonassar <a id="l1235"></a>602, (the year from which we counted the 286 years) &amp; the recconing will place the Ar<a id="l1236"></a>gonautic expedition about 43 years after the death of Solomon. The Greeks have <a id="l1237"></a>therefore made the Argonautic expedition about three hundred years ancienter <a id="l1238"></a>than the truth, &amp; thereby given occasion to the opinion of the great Hipparchus, <a id="l1239"></a>that the Equinox went backward after the rate of only a degree in an hundred years.</p>
<p id="par225">Hesiod tells us that sixty days after the winter solstice the star Arcturus rose <a id="l1240"></a>just at sunset. And thence it follows that Hesiod flourished about an hundred <a id="l1241"></a>years after the death of Solomon, or in the generation or age next after the Trojan <a id="l1242"></a>war as Hesiod himself declares.</p> 
<p id="par226">From all these circumstances grounded upon the coarse observations of <a id="l1243"></a>the ancient Astronomers, we may reccon it certain that the Argonautic expe<a id="l1244"></a>dition was not earlier than the reign of Solomon. And if these Astronomical <a id="l1245"></a>arguments be added to the former arguments taken from the mean length of the <a id="l1246"></a>reigns of Kings according to the course of nature: from them all we may safe<a id="l1247"></a>ly conclude that the Argonautic expedition was after the death of Solomon, &amp; most <a id="l1248"></a>probably that it was about 43 years after it.</p> 
<p id="par227">The Trojan war was one generation later than that expedition, as was <a id="l1249"></a>said above, several captains of the Greeks in that war being sons of the Argo<a id="l1250"></a>nauts. And the ancient Greeks recconed Memnon or Amenophis King of Egypt, <a id="l1251"></a>to have reigned in the times of that war, feigning him to be the son of Tithonus the <a id="l1252"></a>elder brother of Priam, &amp; in the end of that war to have come from Susa to the <a id="l1253"></a>assistance of Priam. Amenophis was therefore of the same age with the elder chil<a id="l1254"></a>dren of Priam, &amp; was with his army at Susa in the last year of that war. And after <a id="l1255"></a>he had there finished the Memnonia, he might return into Egypt, &amp; adorn it with <a id="l1256"></a>buildings &amp; Obelisks &amp; statues, &amp; dye there about 90 or 95 years after the death <a id="l1257"></a>of Solomon when he had determined &amp; settled the beginning of the new Egyptian <a id="l1258"></a>year of 365 days upon the Vernal Equinox, so as to deserve the monument above <a id="l1259"></a>mentioned in memory thereof.</p> 
<p id="par228">Rehoboam was born in the last year of King David, being 41 years old at the death of <a id="l1260"></a>Solomon (1 Kings XIV. 21,) &amp; therefore his father Solomon was born in the 18<sup>th</sup> year of King <a id="l1261"></a>Davids reign or before. And two or three years before his birth, David besieged Rabbah <a id="l1262"></a>the metropolis of the Ammonites, &amp; committed adultery with Bathsheba. And the <a id="l1263"></a>year before this siege began, David vanquished the Ammonites &amp; their confederates the <a id="l1264"></a>Syrians of Zobah &amp; Rehob &amp; Ishtob &amp; Maacah &amp; Damascus, &amp; extended his dominion <a id="l1265"></a>over all these nations as far as to the entring in of Hamath &amp; the river Euphrates. <a id="l1266"></a>And before this war began he smote Moab &amp; Ammon &amp; Edom, &amp; made the Edomites fly, <a id="l1267"></a>some of them into Egypt with their King Hadad then a little child, &amp; others to the Phi<a id="l1268"></a>listims where they fortifyed Azoth against Israel, &amp; others (I think) to the Persian <a id="l1269"></a>gulph &amp; other places whether they could escape. And before this he had several <a id="l1270"></a>battles with the Philistims. And all this was after the eighth year of his reign in which <a id="l1271"></a>he came from Hebron to Ierusalem. We cannot err therefore above two or three <a id="l1272"></a>years if we place this victory over Edom in the eleventh or twelfth year of his <a id="l1273"></a>reign, &amp; that over Ammon &amp; the Syrians in the fourteenth. After the flight of <a id="l1274"></a> Edom, the King of Edom grew up &amp; married Tahaphenes or Daphnis the sister <a id="l1275"></a>of Pharaohs Queen, &amp; before the death of David had by her a son called Genubah, <a id="l1276"></a>&amp; this son was brought up among the children of Pharaoh. And among these <a id="l1277"></a>children was the chief or first born of her mothers children whom Solomon <a id="l1278"></a>married in the beginning of his reign, &amp; her little sister who at that time had no breasts <a id="l1279"></a>&amp; her brother who then sucked the breasts of his mother (Cant. VI. 9. &amp; VIII. 1, 8.) <a id="l1280"></a>And of about the same age with these children was Sesac or Sesostris. For he be<a id="l1281"></a>came King of Egypt in the reign of Solomon (1 King. XI. 40) &amp; before he began to <a id="l1282"></a>reign he warred under his father, &amp; whilst he was very young, conquered Arabia, <a id="l1283"></a>Troglodytica &amp; Libya, &amp; then invaded Æthiopia; &amp; succeeding his father reigned till <a id="l1284"></a>the fift year of Asa: &amp; therefore he was of about the same age with the <a id="l1285"></a>children of Pharaoh above mentioned, &amp; might be one of them, &amp; be born near <a id="l1286"></a>the end of Davids reign, &amp; be about 46 years old when he came out of Egypt <a id="l1287"></a>with a great army to invade the East. And by reason of his great conquests, he <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span> was celebrated in several nations by several names. The Chaldæans called him <a id="l1288"></a><em class="underline">Belus</em> which in their Language signified <em class="underline">the Lord</em>. the Arabians called him <em class="underline">Bacchus</em> which in <a id="l1289"></a>their language signified <em class="underline">the great</em>. The Phrygians &amp; Thracians called him <em class="underline">Ma-fors</em>, <em class="underline">Mavors</em>, <a id="l1290"></a><em class="underline">Mars</em>, which signified the valiant: &amp; thence the Amazons whom he carried from Thrace &amp; left at Thermodon called themselves the daughters of <em class="underline">Mars</em>. The Egyptians before his <a id="l1291"></a>reign called him their <em class="underline">Hero</em> or <em class="underline">Hercules</em>; &amp; after his death, by reason of his great works <a id="l1292"></a>done to the river Nile, dedicated that river to him &amp; deified him by its names <em class="underline">Sihor</em>, <a id="l1293"></a><em class="underline">Nilus</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Ægyptus</em>. And the Greeks hearing them lament 0 Sihor, Bou Sihor, called him <a id="l1294"></a><em class="underline">Osiris</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Busiris</em>. Arrian<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n84-ref">[84]</sup> tells us that the Arabians worshipped only two Gods, Cœlus, <a id="l1295"></a>&amp; Dionysus; &amp; that they worshipped Dionysus for the glory of leading his army into India. <a id="l1296"></a>The Dionysus of the Arabians was Bacchus, &amp; all agree that Bacchus was the same king <a id="l1297"></a>of Egypt with Osiris: &amp; the Cœlus or Vranus or Iupiter Vranius of the Arabians, I <a id="l1298"></a>take to be the same king of Egypt with his father Ammon, according to the Poet:</p>
<div class="lg">
<p class="l">Quamvis Æthiopum populis, Arabumque beatis</p> 
<p class="l">Gentibus, atque Indis unus sit Iupiter <sup>3</sup> Ammon.</p>
</div> 
<p id="par229">I place the end of the reign of <em class="underline">Sesac</em> upon the fift year of Asa because in that <a id="l1299"></a>year Asa became free from the dominion of Egypt, so as to be able to fortify Iudæa <a id="l1300"></a>&amp; raise that great army with which he met Zera &amp; routed him. <em class="underline">Osiris</em> was therefore <a id="l1301"></a>slain in the fift year of <em class="underline">Asa</em> by his brother Iapetus whom the Egyptians called <a id="l1302"></a><em class="underline">Typhon</em> <em class="underline">Pytohn</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Neptune</em>. And then the Libyans under <em class="underline">Iapetus</em> &amp; his son <em class="underline">Atlas</em> <a id="l1303"></a>invaded Egypt,  &amp; raised that famous war between the Gods &amp; Giants, from <a id="l1304"></a>whence the Nile had the name of <em class="underline">Eridanus</em>. But Orus the son of Osiris by the assistance <a id="l1305"></a>of the Ethiopians prevailed &amp; reigned till the 15<sup>th</sup> year of Asa. And then the Ethio<a id="l1306"></a>pians under Zera invaded Egypt, drowned Orus in Eridanus, &amp; were routed by Asa so <a id="l1307"></a>that Zera could not recover himself. Zera was succeeded by Amenophis a youth <a id="l1308"></a>of the royal family of the Ethiopians, &amp; I think the son of Zerah. But the people <a id="l1309"></a>of the lower Egypt revolted from him &amp; set up Osarsiphus over them, &amp; called to their <a id="l1310"></a>assistance a great body of men from Phænicia, I think a part of the army of Asa. <a id="l1311"></a>And thereupon Amenophis with the remains of his fathers army of Ethiopians, <a id="l1312"></a>retired from the lower Egypt to Memphys, &amp; there turned the river Nile into a <a id="l1313"></a>new channel under a new bridge which he built between two Mountains, &amp; at the same <a id="l1314"></a>time he built &amp; fortifyed that city against Osarsiphus, calling it by his own name <a id="l1315"></a>Amenoph or Memphis. And then he retired into Ethiopia &amp; stayed there thirteen <a id="l1316"></a>years: &amp; then came back with a great army, &amp; subdued the lower Egypt, expelling <a id="l1317"></a>the people which had been called in from Phænicia. And this I take to be the second <a id="l1318"></a>expulsion of the shepherds. Dr Castel<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n85-ref">[85]</sup> tells us that in Coptic this city is called <a id="l1319"></a>Manphtha. Whence by contraction came its names Moph, Noph.</p> 
<p id="par230">While Amenophis stayd in Ethiopia, Egypt was in its greatest distrac<a id="l1320"></a>tion. And then it was, as I conceive that the Greeks hearing thereof contrived <a id="l1321"></a>the Argonautic Expedition, &amp; sent the flower of Greece in the Ship Argo to <a id="l1322"></a>persuade the nations upon the sea coasts of the Euxine &amp; Mediterranean seas to <a id="l1323"></a>revolt from Egypt &amp; set up for themselves, as the Libyans Ethiopians &amp; Iews <a id="l1324"></a>had done before. And this is a further argument for placing that Expedition <a id="l1325"></a>about 43 years after the death of Solomon; this period being in the middle <a id="l1326"></a>of the distraction of Egypt. Amenophis might return from Ethiopia &amp; <a id="l1327"></a>conquer the lower Egypt about eight years after that Expedition, &amp; <a id="l1328"></a>having settled his government over it, he might for putting a stop to the <a id="l1329"></a>revolting of the Eastern nations, lead his Army into Persia, &amp; leave Proteus <a id="l1330"></a>at Memphis to govern Egypt in his absence, &amp; stay sometime at Susa &amp; build <a id="l1331"></a>the Memnonia, fortifying that city as the metropolis of his dominion in those parts.</p> 
<p id="par231">Androgeus the son of Minos, upon his overcoming in the Athenæa or <a id="l1332"></a>quadrennial games at Athens in his youth, was perfidiously slain out of envy. And <a id="l1333"></a>Minos thereupon made war upon the Athenians, &amp; compelled them to send every <a id="l1334"></a>eighth year to Crete seven beardless youths &amp; as many young virgins to be given <a id="l1335"></a>as a reward to him that should get the victory in the like games instituted in <a id="l1336"></a>Crete in honour of Androgeus. These games seem to have been celebrated in the <a id="l1337"></a>beginning of the Octaeteris, &amp; the Athenæa in the beginning of the Tetraeteris then brought <a id="l1338"></a>into Crete &amp; Greece by the Phænicians. And upon the third payment of the tribute of chil<a id="l1339"></a>dren, that is, about seventeen years after the said warr was at an end, &amp; about nine<a id="l1340"></a>teen or twenty years after the death of Androgeus, Theseus became victor &amp; returned <a id="l1341"></a>from Crete with Ariadne the daughter of Minos. And coming to the island Naxus or <a id="l1342"></a>Dia,<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n86-ref">[86]</sup> Ariadne was there relinquished by him &amp; taken up by Glaucus an Egyptian Commander <a id="l1343"></a>at Sea, &amp; became the mistress of the great Bacchus, who at that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027r"> &lt;27r&gt; </span> time returned from India in triumph, &amp;<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n87-ref">[87]</sup> by him she had two sons, <em class="underline">Phylas</em> &amp; <a id="l1344"></a><em class="underline">Eumedon</em> who were Argonauts. This Bacchus was caught in bed in Phrygia <a id="l1345"></a>with Venus the mother of Æneas,  according to Homer,<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n88-ref">[88]</sup> just before <a id="l1346"></a>he came over the Hellespont &amp; invaded Thrace;  &amp; he married Ariadne the <a id="l1347"></a>daughter of Minos according to Hesiod<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n89-ref">[89]</sup>. And therefore by the testimony of <a id="l1348"></a>both Homer &amp; Hesiod, who wrote before the Greeks &amp; Egyptians corrupted their <a id="l1349"></a>antiquities, this Bacchus was one generation older than the Argonauts. And so being <a id="l1350"></a>king of Egypt at the same time with Sesostris, they must be one &amp; the same king. For <a id="l1351"></a>they agree also in their actions. Bacchus invaded India &amp; Greece, &amp; after he was <a id="l1352"></a>routed by the army of Perseus &amp; the war was composed; the Greeks did him great <a id="l1353"></a>honours, &amp; built a temple to him at Argos, &amp; called it the temple of the Cresian <a id="l1354"></a>Bacchus because Ariadne was buried in it, as Pausanias<sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n90-ref">[90]</sup> relates. Ariadne therefore <a id="l1355"></a>died in the end of the war just before the return of Sesostris into Egypt, that is, <a id="l1356"></a>in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam. She was taken from Theseus upon the return <a id="l1357"></a>of Bacchus from India, &amp; then became the mistress of Bacchus &amp; accompanied him in <a id="l1358"></a>his triumphs. And therefore the expedition of Theseus to Crete &amp; the death of his father <a id="l1359"></a>Ægeus was about nine or ten years after the death of Solomon. Theseus was then <a id="l1360"></a>a beardless young man, suppose about 19 or 20 years old, &amp; Androgeus was slain <a id="l1361"></a>about twenty years before, being then about 20 or 22 years old, &amp; his father <a id="l1362"></a>Minos might be about 25 years older, &amp; so be born about the middle of Davids <a id="l1363"></a>reign, &amp; be about 70 years old when he pursued Dædalus into Crete: &amp; Europa &amp; <a id="l1364"></a>her brother Cadmus might come into Europe two or three years before the birth of Minos.</p>

The <a id="l1373"></a>new inhabitants of Tyre had not yet lost the name of Zidonians, nor had <a id="l1374"></a>the old inhabitants (if there were any considerable number of them) <a id="l1375"></a>gained the reputation of the new ones for skill in hewing of timber, as they <a id="l1376"></a>would have done had navigation been long in use at Tyre. The artificers <a id="l1377"></a>who came from Sidon were not dead, &amp; the flight of the Zidonians was in the <a id="l1378"></a>reign of David &amp; by consequence in the beginning of the reign of Abibalus the <a id="l1379"></a>father of Hiram, &amp; the first king of Tyre mentioned in history. David in the <a id="l1380"></a>twelft year of his reign conquered Edom as above, &amp; made some of the Edomites <a id="l1381"></a>&amp; chiefly the merchants &amp; seamen fly from the <em class="underline">red sea</em> to the Philistims upon the <a id="l1382"></a>Mediterranean where they fortified Azoth. For<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n94-ref">[94]</sup> Stephanus tells us: Ταύτην <a id="l1383"></a>ἔκτιςεν ἕις των ἐπανελθόντων ἀπ᾽ Ερυθρας θαλάσσης φευγάδων: <a id="l1384"></a><em class="underline">One of the fugitives from the red sea built Azoth</em>. That is, A Prince of Edom <a id="l1385"></a>who fled from  David, fortified Azoth for the Philistims against him. <a id="l1386"></a>The Philistims were now grown very strong by the access of the Edomites &amp; sheep<a id="l1387"></a>herds, &amp; by their assistance invaded &amp; took Zidon, that being a town very conve<a id="l1388"></a>nient for the merchants who fled from the red sea. And then did the Zidonians <a id="l1389"></a>fly by sea to Tyre &amp; Aradus &amp; to other havens in Asia minor, Greece, &amp; Libya <a id="l1390"></a>with which, by means of their trade, they had been acquainted before; the great <a id="l1391"></a>wars &amp; victories of David their enemy, prompting them to fly by sea. For<sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n95-ref">[95]</sup> they <a id="l1392"></a>went with a great multitude, not to seek Europa as was pretended, but to <a id="l1393"></a>seek new seats, &amp; therefore fled from their enemies. And when  <a id="l1394"></a>some of them fled under Cadmus &amp; his brothers to Cilicia, Asia minor &amp; Greece, <a id="l1395"></a>others fled under other commanders to seek new seats in Libya, &amp; there built <a id="l1396"></a>many walled towns, as Nonnus<sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n96-ref">[96]</sup> affirms. And their leader was also there called <a id="l1397"></a>Cadmus, which word signifies an eastern man, &amp; his wife was called Sithonis a Zidonian. <a id="l1398"></a>And many from those cities went afterwards with the great Bacchus in his armies. <a id="l1399"></a>And by these things the taking of Zidon &amp; the flight of the Zidonians under Abibalus, <a id="l1400"></a>Cadmus, Cilix, Thasus, Membliarius, Atymnus &amp; other captains, to Tyre, Aradus, Cilicia, <a id="l1401"></a>Rhodes, Caria, Bithynia, Phrygia, Callisthe, Thasus, Samothrace, Crete, Greece &amp; Libya, &amp; <a id="l1402"></a>the building of Tyre &amp; Thebes, &amp; beginning of the reign of Abibalus &amp; Cadmus over those <a id="l1403"></a>cities are fixed upon the fifteenth or sixteenth year of Davids reign or thereabout. By <a id="l1404"></a>means of these colonies of Phenicians, the people of Caria learnt sea affairs in such small <a id="l1405"></a>vessels with oars as were then in use, &amp; began to frequent the Greek seas, &amp; people some of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p028r"> &lt;28r&gt; </span> islands therein before the reign of Minos. For Cadmus in coming to Greece arrived <a id="l1406"></a>first at Rhodes, an island upon the borders of Caria, &amp; left there a colony of <a id="l1407"></a>Phenicians who sacrificed men to Saturn; &amp; the Telchines being repulsed by <a id="l1408"></a>Phoroneus retired from Argos to Rhodes with Phorbas who purged the island from <a id="l1409"></a>serpents; &amp; Triopas the son of Phorbas carried a colony from Rhodes to Caria, &amp; <a id="l1410"></a>there possessed himself of a  promontory thence called Triopium, And <a id="l1411"></a>by this &amp; such like colonies Caria was furnished with shipping &amp; seamen <a id="l1412"></a>&amp; called<sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n97-ref">[97]</sup> Phœnice. Strabo &amp; Herodotus<sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n98-ref">[98]</sup> tell us that the Cares were called <a id="l1413"></a>Leleges, &amp; became subject to Minos, &amp; lived first in the islands of the Greek seas <a id="l1414"></a>&amp; went thence into Caria a country possest before by some of the Leleges &amp; Pelasgi. Whence <a id="l1415"></a>its probable that when Lelex &amp; Pelasgus came first into Greece to seek new seats, they <a id="l1416"></a>left part of their colonies in Caria &amp; the neighbouring islands.</p> 
<p id="par233">The Sidonians being still possessed of the trade of the mediterranean as far <a id="l1417"></a>westward as Greece &amp; Libya, &amp; the trade of the red sea being richer, the Tyrians <a id="l1418"></a>traded on the red sea in conjunction with Solomon &amp; the kings of Iudah till after <a id="l1419"></a>the Trojan warr. And so also did the merchants of Aradus, Arvad or Arpad. For in <a id="l1420"></a>the Persian gulph<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n99-ref">[99]</sup> were two islands called Tyre &amp; Aradus which had Temples <a id="l1421"></a>like the Phenician. And therefore the Tyrians &amp; Aradians sailed thither &amp; beyond <a id="l1422"></a>to the coasts of India while the Zidonians frequented the Mediterranean. And <a id="l1423"></a>hence it is that Homer celebrates Zidon &amp; makes no mention of Tyre. But at <a id="l1424"></a>length<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n100-ref">[100]</sup> in the reign of Iehoram king of Iudah, Edom revolted from the dominion <a id="l1425"></a>of Iudah &amp; made themselves a king. And the trade of Iudah &amp; Tyre upon the <em class="underline">red <a id="l1426"></a>sea</em> being thereby interrupted, the Tyrians built ships for merchandise upon <a id="l1427"></a>the mediterranean, &amp; began there to make long voyages to places not yet <a id="l1428"></a>frequented by the Zidonians, some of them going to the coasts of Afric beyond <a id="l1429"></a>the Syrtes &amp; building Adrumetum, Carthage, Leptis, Vtica, &amp; Capsa, &amp; others <a id="l1430"></a>going to the coasts of Spain, &amp; building Carteia Gades &amp; Tartessus, &amp; others <a id="l1431"></a>going further to the fortunate islands &amp; to Britain &amp; Thule. Iehoram reign<a id="l1432"></a>ed eight years, &amp; the two last years was sick in his bowels, &amp; before that <a id="l1433"></a>sickness Edom revolted because of Iehorams wicked reign. If we place that <a id="l1434"></a>revolt about the middle of the first six years, it will fall upon the fift year of <a id="l1435"></a>pigmaleon king of Tyre, &amp; so was about twelve or fifteen years after the <a id="l1436"></a>taking of Troy. And then by reason of this revolt, the Tyrians retired from <a id="l1437"></a>the red sea &amp; began long voyages upon the Mediterranean. For in the <a id="l1438"></a>seventh year of pigmaleon, his sister Dido sailed to the coast of Afric <a id="l1439"></a>beyond the Syrtes, &amp; there built Carthage. And this retiring of the Tyrians <a id="l1440"></a>from the red sea to make long voyages on the Mediterranean, together <a id="l1441"></a>with the flight of the Edomites from David to the Philistims, gave occasion <a id="l1442"></a>to the tradition both of the ancient Persians, &amp; of the Phenicians themselves, that <a id="l1443"></a>the Phenicians came originally from the red sea to the sea coasts of the Mediter<a id="l1444"></a>ranean, &amp; presently undertook long voyages, as Herodotus<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n101-ref">[101]</sup> relates. For Hero<a id="l1445"></a>dotus in the beginning of his first book relates that the Phenicians coming from <a id="l1446"></a>the red sea to the Mediterranean &amp; beginning to make long voyages with Egyptian <a id="l1447"></a>&amp; assyrian wares, among other places came to Argos, &amp; having sold their wares, <a id="l1448"></a>seized &amp; carried away into Egypt some of the Grecian weomen who came to <a id="l1449"></a>buy them; &amp; amongst those weomen was Io the daughter of Inachus. The Phenicians <a id="l1450"></a>therefore came from the red sea in the days of Io &amp; her brother Phoroneus king of <a id="l1451"></a>Argos, &amp; by consequence at that time when David conquered the Edomites, &amp; made <a id="l1452"></a>them fly every way from the red sea, some into Egypt with their young king, &amp; others <a id="l1453"></a>to the Philistims their next neighbours &amp; the enemies of David. And this flight gave <a id="l1454"></a>occasion to the Philistims to call many places Erythra in memory of their being <a id="l1455"></a>Erythreans or Edomites &amp; of their coming from the Erythrean Sea. For Erythra <a id="l1456"></a>was the name of a city in Ionia, of another in Libya, of another in Locris, of <a id="l1457"></a>another in Bœotia, of another in Cyprus, of another in Ætolia, of another in <a id="l1458"></a>Asia near Chius, &amp; Erythia Acra was a promontory in Libya, &amp; Erythræum a <a id="l1459"></a>promontory in Crete, &amp; Erythros a place near Tybur, &amp; Erythini a city or <a id="l1460"></a>country in Paphlagonia. And the name Erythia or Erythræ was given to the island <a id="l1461"></a>Gades peopled by Phenicians. So Solinus<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n102-ref">[102]</sup>: <em class="underline">In capite Bæticæ insula a conti<a id="l1462"></a>nenti septingentis passibus memoratur quam Tyrij a rubro mari profecti <a id="l1463"></a>Erytheam, Pœni sua lingua Gadir, id est sepem nominarunt</em>.

This Hercules in memory of his <a id="l1488"></a>building &amp; reigning over the city <em class="underline">Carteia</em> they called also <em class="underline">Melcartus</em>, the <a id="l1489"></a>king of Carteia. Bochart<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n110-ref">[110]</sup> writes that Carteia was at first called Melcar<a id="l1490"></a>teia from its founder Melcartus, &amp; by an Aphæresis Carteia; &amp; that Melcar<a id="l1491"></a>tus signifies Melec Kartha, the king of the city, that is, saith he, of the <a id="l1492"></a>city Tyre. But considering that no ancient author tells us that Carteia <a id="l1493"></a>was ever called Melcarteia or that Melcartus was king of Tyre: I had <a id="l1494"></a>rather say that Melcartus or Melec-cartus had his name from being <a id="l1495"></a>the founder &amp; governor or Prince of the city Carteia. Vnder Melcartus <a id="l1496"></a>the Tyrians sailed as far as Tartessus or Tarshish, a place in the western <a id="l1497"></a>part of Spain between the two mouths of the river Bœtis, &amp; there they<sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n111-ref">[111]</sup> met <a id="l1498"></a>with much silver which they purchased for trifles. They sailed also as <a id="l1499"></a>far as Britain before the death of Melcartus. For<sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n112-ref">[112]</sup> Pliny tells us: <em class="underline">Plumbum <a id="l1500"></a>ex Cassiteride insula primus apportavit Midacritus</em>. And Bochart<sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n113-ref">[113]</sup> observes <a id="l1501"></a>that <em class="underline">Midacritus</em> is a Greek name corruptly written for <em class="underline">Melcartus</em>; Bri<a id="l1502"></a>tain being unknown to the Greeks long after it was discovered by the <a id="l1503"></a>Phenicians. After the death of Melcartus they<sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n114-ref">[114]</sup> built a temple to him in <a id="l1504"></a>the island Gades, &amp; adorned it with the sculptures of the labours of Hercules <a id="l1505"></a>&amp; of his Hydra &amp; the horses to whom he threw Diomedes king of the Bistones in <a id="l1506"></a>Thrace to be devoured. In this temple was the golden belt of <em class="underline">Teucer</em>, &amp; the <a id="l1507"></a>golden olive of Pigmaleon bearing Smaradine fruit. And by these consecrated <a id="l1508"></a>gifts of <em class="underline">Teucer</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Pigmaleon</em> you may know that it was built in their days. <a id="l1509"></a>Pomponius derives it from the times of the Trojan warr. For Teucer seven <a id="l1510"></a>years after that warr (according to the Marbles) arrived at Cyprus, being <a id="l1511"></a>banished from home by his father Telamon, &amp; there built Salamis. And he <a id="l1512"></a>&amp; his posterity reigned there till Evagoras the last of them was conquered <a id="l1513"></a>by the Persians in the twelft year of Artaxerxes Mnemon. Certainly <a id="l1514"></a>this Tyrian Hercules could be no older than the Trojan warr because the Tyrians <a id="l1515"></a>did not begin to navigate the Mediterranean till after that warr. For Homer &amp; <a id="l1516"></a>Hesiod knew nothing of this navigation, &amp; the Tyrian Hercules went to the coasts of  Spain <a id="l1517"></a>&amp; was buried in Gades. So Arnobius<sup>k</sup><sup class="note" id="n115-ref">[115]</sup>: <em class="underline">Tyrius Hercules sepultus in finibus Hispaniæ</em>: <a id="l1518"></a>And Melas speaking of the temple of Hercules in Gades, saith: <em class="underline">Cur sanctum sit ossa <a id="l1519"></a>ejus ibi sepulta efficiunt</em>. Carthage<sup>l</sup><sup class="note" id="n116-ref">[116]</sup> paid tenths to this Hercules, &amp; sent their <a id="l1520"></a>payments yearly to Tyre. And thence its probable that this Hercules went to the <a id="l1521"></a>coast of Afric as well as to that of Spain, &amp; by his discoveries prepared the way <a id="l1522"></a>to Dido. Orosius<sup>m</sup><sup class="note" id="n117-ref">[117]</sup> &amp; others tell us that he built Capsa there. Iosephus tells of an <a id="l1523"></a>earlier Hercules to whom Hiram built a temple at Tyre: &amp; perhaps there might <a id="l1524"></a>be also an earlier Hercules of Tyre who set on foot their trade on the red sea in the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030r"> &lt;30r&gt; </span> days of David or Solomon.</p> 
<p id="par235">Tatian in his book against the Greeks relates that amongst the Phœnicians <a id="l1525"></a>flourished three ancient historians, Theodotus, Hysicrates &amp; Mochus, <em class="underline">who all of them <a id="l1526"></a>delivered in their histories (translated into Greek by Lætus) under which of the <a id="l1527"></a>kings happened the rapture of Europa, the voyage of Menelaus into Phœnicia, &amp; the <a id="l1528"></a>league &amp; friendship between Solomon &amp; Hiram when Hiram gave his daughter <a id="l1529"></a>to Solomon &amp; furnished him with timber for building the Temple: &amp; that the <a id="l1530"></a>same is affirmed by Menander of Pergamus</em>. Iosephus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n118-ref">[118]</sup> lets us know that <a id="l1531"></a>the Annals of the Tyrians from the days of Abibalus &amp; Hiram Kings of Tyre <a id="l1532"></a>were extant in his days, &amp; that Menander of Pergamus translated them into <a id="l1533"></a>Greek, &amp; that Hirams friendship to Solomon, &amp; assistance in building the temple, <a id="l1534"></a>was mentioned in them, &amp; that the temple was founded in the eleventh <a id="l1535"></a>year of Hiram. And by the testimony of Menander &amp; the ancient Phœnician <a id="l1536"></a>historians, the rapture of Europa, &amp; by consequence the coming of her brother <a id="l1537"></a>Cadmus into Greece, happened within the time of the reigns of the kings of Tyre <a id="l1538"></a>delivered in these histories, &amp; therefore not before the reign of Abibalus the first <a id="l1539"></a>of them, nor before the reign of king David his contemporary. The voyage of <a id="l1540"></a>Menelaus might be after the destruction of Troy. Solomon therefore reigned <a id="l1541"></a>in the times between the raptures of Europa &amp; Helena, &amp; Europa &amp; her brother <a id="l1542"></a>Cadmus flourished in the days of David. Minos the son of Europa flourished <a id="l1543"></a>in the reign of Solomon &amp; part of the reign of Rehoboam. And the children of <a id="l1544"></a>Minos (namely Androgeus his eldest son, Deucaleon his youngest son &amp; one of the Argonauts, Ariadne the mistress of Theseus &amp; Bacchus, &amp; Phædra the <a id="l1545"></a>wife of Theseus) flourished in the latter end of Solomon, &amp; in the reigns of Rehobo<a id="l1546"></a>am Abia &amp; Asa. And Idomeneus the grandson of Minos was at the warr of Troy. <a id="l1547"></a>And Hiram succeeded his father Abibalus in the three &amp; twentieth year of David. <a id="l1548"></a>And Abibalus might found the Kingdome of Tyre about sixteen or eighteen <a id="l1549"></a>years before when Sidon was taken by the Philistims. And the Sidonians fled <a id="l1550"></a>from thence under the conduct of Cadmus &amp; other commanders to seek new <a id="l1551"></a>seats. And thus by the Annals of Tyre &amp; the ancient Phœnician historians <a id="l1552"></a>who followed them, Abibalus, Alymnus, Cadmus, &amp; Europa fled from Sidon about <a id="l1553"></a>the sixteenth year of Davids reign : &amp; the Argonautic expedition being later <a id="l1554"></a>by about three generations, will be about three hundred years later than <a id="l1555"></a>where the Greeks have placed it.</p> 
<p id="par236">After navigation in long ships with sails &amp; one order of oars had <a id="l1556"></a>been propagated from Egypt to Phœnicia &amp; Greece, &amp; thereby the Sidonians <a id="l1557"></a>had extended their trade to Greece, &amp; carried it on about an hundred &amp; fifty <a id="l1558"></a>years, &amp; then the Tyrians being driven from the red sea by the Edomites <a id="l1559"></a>had begun a new trade on the mediterranean with Spain, Afric, Britain <a id="l1560"></a>&amp; other  remote nations; they carried it on about an hundred &amp; <a id="l1561"></a>sixty years; &amp; then the Corinthians began to improve navigation by <a id="l1562"></a>building bigger ships with three orders of Oares called Triremes. For <a id="l1563"></a><sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n119-ref">[119]</sup> Thucydides tells us that the Corinthians were the first of the Greeks who <a id="l1564"></a>built such ships, &amp; that a ship carpenter of Corinth went thence to Samos <a id="l1565"></a>about 300 years before the end of the Peloponnesian warr, &amp; built also <a id="l1566"></a>four ships for the Samians; &amp; that 260 years before the end of that warr, that is, about the 29<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, there was a fight at sea between the Corin<a id="l1567"></a>thians &amp; the Corcyreans, which was the oldest sea fight mentioned in history. Thu<a id="l1568"></a>cydides tells us further that the first colony which the Greeks sent into Si<a id="l1569"></a>cily, came from Chalcis in Eubœa under the conduct of Thucles &amp; built <a id="l1570"></a>Naxus, &amp; the next year Archias came from Corinth with a colony &amp; built <a id="l1571"></a>Syracuse; &amp; that Lamis came about the same time into Sicily with a <a id="l1572"></a>colony from Megara in Achaia, &amp; lived first at Trotilum &amp; then at Leontini, <a id="l1573"></a>&amp; died at Thapsus neare Syracuse; &amp; that after his death, this colony was <a id="l1574"></a>invited by Hyblo to Megara in Sicily, &amp; lived there 245 years, &amp; was then <a id="l1575"></a>expelled by Gelo king of Sicily. Now Gelo flourished about 78 years before <a id="l1576"></a>the end of the Peloponnesian warr. Count backwards the 78 &amp; the 245 years &amp; <a id="l1577"></a>about 12 years more for the reign of Lamis in Sicily, &amp; the recconing will <a id="l1578"></a>place the building of Syracuse about 335 years before the end of the Pelopo<a id="l1579"></a>nesian war or in the tenth Olympiad. And about that time Eusebius &amp; others <a id="l1580"></a>place it. But it might be twenty or thirty years later, the antiquities of those <a id="l1581"></a>days having been raised more or less by the Greeks.

<p id="par237">Thucydides<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n120-ref">[120]</sup> tells us further that the Greeks began to come into Sicily <a id="l1583"></a>almost three hundred years after the Siculi had invaded that island with an <a id="l1584"></a>army out of Italy.  Suppose it  280 years after, &amp; the building of <a id="l1585"></a>Syracuse 310 years before the end of the Peloponnesian warr; &amp; that invasion <a id="l1586"></a>of Sicily by the Siculi will be 590 years before the end of that warr, that is, in the 27<sup>th</sup> <a id="l1587"></a>year of Solomons reign, or thereabout. Hellanicus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n121-ref">[121]</sup> tells us that it was in the <a id="l1588"></a>third generation before the Trojan warr, &amp; in the 26<sup>th</sup> year of the priesthood <a id="l1589"></a>of Alcinoe priestess of Iuno Argiva: &amp; Philistius of Syracuse, that it was <a id="l1590"></a>80 years before the Trojan warr; Whence it follows that the Trojan warr <a id="l1591"></a>&amp; Argonautic expedition were  later than the days of Solomon &amp; Rehoboam, <a id="l1592"></a>&amp; could not be much earlier than where we have placed them.</p> 
<p id="par238">The Kingdom of Macedon<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n122-ref">[122]</sup> was founded by Caranus &amp; Perdiccas who being <a id="l1593"></a>of the race of Temenus king of Argos, fled from Argos in the reign of Phidon <a id="l1594"></a>the brother of Caranus. Temenus was one of the three brothers who led the <a id="l1595"></a>Heraclides into Peloponnesus &amp; shared the conquest among themselves. He obteined <a id="l1596"></a> Argos, &amp; after him &amp; his son Cisus, the Kingdom of Argos became divided <a id="l1597"></a>among the posterity of Temenus until Phidon reunited it, expelling his <a id="l1598"></a>kindred. Phidon grew potent, appointed weights &amp; measures in Peloponnesus, <a id="l1599"></a>&amp; coyned silver money; &amp; removing the Pisæans &amp; Elians, presided in the <a id="l1600"></a>Olympic games; but was soon after subdued by the Elians &amp; Spartans. <a id="l1601"></a>Herodotus<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n123-ref">[123]</sup> reccons that Perdiccas was the first King of Macedon. Later <a id="l1602"></a>writers, as Livy Pausanias &amp; Suidas, make Caranus the first King. Iustin <a id="l1603"></a>calls Perdiccas the successor of Caranus, &amp; Solinus saith that Perdiccas suc<a id="l1604"></a>ceeded Caranus &amp; was the first that obtained the name of king. Its probable <a id="l1605"></a>that Caranus &amp; Perdiccas were contemporaries &amp; fled about the same time <a id="l1606"></a>from Phidon, &amp; at first erected small principalities in Macedonia, which after <a id="l1607"></a>the death of Caranus became one under Perdiccas. Herodotus<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n124-ref">[124]</sup> tells us that <a id="l1608"></a>after Perdiccas reigned Aræus (or Argæus,) Philip, Æropus, Alcetes, Amyn<a id="l1609"></a>tas &amp; Alexander successively. Alexander was contemporary to Xerxes king <a id="l1610"></a>of Persia &amp; died An.4 Olymp. 79, &amp; was succeeded by Perdiccas &amp; he by his <a id="l1611"></a>son Archelaus. And Thucydides<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n125-ref">[125]</sup> tells us that there were eight Kings of <a id="l1612"></a>Macedon before this Archelaus. Now by recconing above forty years a piece <a id="l1613"></a>to these kings, Chronologers have made Phidon &amp; Caranus older than the <a id="l1614"></a>Olympiads; whereas if we should reccon their reigns at about 18 or 20 <a id="l1615"></a>years a piece one with another, the first seven reigns counted backwards <a id="l1616"></a>from the death of this Alexander, will place the dominion of Phidon &amp; the be<a id="l1617"></a>ginning of the Kingdom of Macedon under Perdiccas &amp; Caranus, upon the <a id="l1618"></a>46 or 47<sup>th</sup> Olympiad or thereabout. It could scarce be earlier because <a id="l1619"></a>Leocides the son of Phidon, &amp; Megacles the son of Alcmæon, at one &amp; the <a id="l1620"></a>same time courted Agarista the daughter of Clisthenes king of Sicyon (as <a id="l1621"></a>Herodotus<sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n126-ref">[126]</sup> tells us,) &amp; the Amphictyons by the advice of Solon made Alc<a id="l1622"></a>mæon &amp; Clisthenes &amp; Eurolycus king of Thessaly commanders of their army <a id="l1623"></a>in their war against Cyrrha, &amp; the Cyrrheans were conquered An. 2 Olymp. <a id="l1624"></a>47 according to the Marbles. Phidon therefore &amp; his brother Caranus <a id="l1625"></a>were contemporary to Solon, Alcmæon, Clisthenes &amp; Eurolycus, &amp; flourish<a id="l1626"></a>ed about the 48<sup>th</sup> &amp; 49<sup>th</sup> Olympiads. They were also contemporary in <a id="l1627"></a>their later days to Cræsus. For Solon conversed with Cræsus, &amp; Alcmæon <a id="l1628"></a>entertained &amp; conducted the messengers whom Cræsus sent to consult the Oracle <a id="l1629"></a>at Delphos An. 1, Olymp. 56 according to the Marbles, &amp; was sent for by Cræsus &amp; rewarded with much riches.</p> 
    <p id="par239">But the times set down in the Marbles before the Persian Empire <a id="l1630"></a>began, being collected by recconing the reigns of kings equipollent to generati<a id="l1631"></a>ons, &amp; three generations to an hundred years or above; &amp; the reigns of kings one <a id="l1632"></a>with another being shorter in the proportion of about seven to four: the <a id="l1633"></a>chronology set down in the marbles until the conquest of Media by Cyrus <a id="l1634"></a>An. 4 Olymp.60, will approach the truth much nearer by shortening the times <a id="l1635"></a>before that conquest in the proportion of seven to four. So the Cirrheans <a id="l1636"></a>were conquered An. 2 Olymp. 47 according to the Marbles that is 54 years before <a id="l1637"></a>the conquest of Media. And these years being shortened in the proportion of 7 to four, become 31 years. Which subducted from An.4 Olymp. 60, place the <a id="l1638"></a>conquest of Cirrha upon An. 1, Olymp. 53. And by the like correction of the Marbles <a id="l1639"></a>Alcmæon entertained &amp; conducted the messengers whom Cræsus sent to consult <a id="l1640"></a>the Oracle at Delphos An. 1, Olymp. 58, that is, four years before the conquest <a id="l1641"></a>of Sardes by Cyrus. And the tyranny of Pisistratus, which by the Marbles began <a id="l1642"></a>at Athens An:4, Olymp:54, by the like correction began An. 3, Olymp. 57, &amp; by <a id="l1643"></a>consequence Solon died An.4 Olymp. 57. This method may be used alone where <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p032r"> &lt;32r&gt; </span> other arguments are wanting; but where they are not wanting, the best arguments are to be preferred.</p>
<p id="par240">Iphitus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n127-ref">[127]</sup> presided both in the Temple of Iupiter Olympius, &amp; in the Olympic <a id="l1644"></a>games, &amp; so did his successors till the 26<sup>th</sup> Olympiad: &amp; so long the victors were <a id="l1645"></a>rewarded with a Tripos. But then the Pisæans getting above the Eleans, began to <a id="l1646"></a>preside &amp; rewarded the victors with a crown, &amp; instituted the Carnea to Apollo; <a id="l1647"></a>&amp; continued to preside 'till Phidon interrupted them, that is, till about the time <a id="l1648"></a>of the 49<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. For<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n128-ref">[128]</sup> in the 48<sup>th</sup> Olympiad the Eleans entered the coun<a id="l1649"></a>try of the Pisæans, suspecting their designes, but were prevailed upon to return <a id="l1650"></a>home quietly. Afterwards the Pisæans confederated with several other Greek <a id="l1651"></a>nations &amp; made war upon the Eleans, &amp; in the end  were beaten. In <a id="l1652"></a>this warr I conceive it was that Phidon presided, suppose in the 49<sup>th</sup> Olym<a id="l1653"></a>piad. For<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n129-ref">[129]</sup> in the 50<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, for putting an end to the contentions between <a id="l1654"></a>the Kings about presiding, two men were chosen by lot out of the city Elis to <a id="l1655"></a>preside, &amp; their number in the 65 Olympiad was increased to nine, and <a id="l1656"></a>afterwards to ten : &amp; these judges were called Hellenodicæ, judges for or <a id="l1657"></a>in the name of Greece. Pausanias tells us that the Eleans called in Phidon <a id="l1658"></a>&amp; together with him celebrated the 8<sup>th</sup> Olympiad: he should have said the <a id="l1659"></a>49<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. But Herodotus tells us that Phidon removed the Eleans. <a id="l1660"></a>And both might be true. The Eleans might call in Phidon against the <a id="l1661"></a>Pisæans, &amp; upon overcoming be refused presiding in the Olympic games <a id="l1662"></a>by Phidon, &amp; confederate with the Spartans, &amp; by their assistance overthrow <a id="l1663"></a>the Kingdom of Phidon, &amp; recover their ancient right of presiding in the games.</p> 
<p id="par241">Strabo<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n130-ref">[130]</sup> tells us that Phidon was the tenth from Temenus; not the tenth King <a id="l1664"></a>(for between Cisus &amp; Phidon they reigned not) but the tenth from father to <a id="l1665"></a>son including Temenus.

<p id="par242">Cyrus took Babylon (according to Ptolomy's Canon) nine years before <a id="l1673"></a>his death, Anno Nabonass 209, Anno 2 Olymp. 60.

After Solon had made laws for the <a id="l1677"></a>Athenians, he obliged them upon oath to observe those laws till he returned <a id="l1678"></a>from his travells; &amp; then travelled ten years going to Egypt &amp; Cyprus, &amp; visiting <a id="l1679"></a>Thales of Miletus. And upon his return to Athens, Pisistratus began to affect <a id="l1680"></a>the tyranny of that city, which made Solon travel a second time. And now <a id="l1681"></a>he was invited by Cræsus to Sardes. And Cræsus before Solon visited him <a id="l1682"></a>had subdued all Asia minor as far as to the river Halys; &amp; therefore he <a id="l1683"></a>received that visit towards the latter part of his reign. And we may place <a id="l1684"></a>it upon the ninth year thereof Anno 3 Olymp. 57, &amp; the legislature of Solon <a id="l1685"></a>twelve years earlier Anno 3Olymp 54, &amp; that of Draco still ten years <a id="l1686"></a>earlier Anno 1 Olymp. 52. After Solon had visited Cræsus, he went <a id="l1687"></a>into Cilicia &amp; some other places, &amp; died in his travells.

<p id="par244">Whilst Bacchus made his expedition into India, Theseus left Ariadne <a id="l1723"></a>in the Island Naxus or Dia as above, &amp; succeeded his father Ægeus at Athens <a id="l1724"></a>&amp; upon the return of Bacchus from India Ariadne became his mistress, <a id="l1725"></a>&amp; accompanied him in his triumphs. And this was about ten years after <a id="l1726"></a>the death of Solomon.

These Kings at 19 years a piece one with another <a id="l1729"></a>might take up about 152 years, &amp; end about 44 years before the <a id="l1730"></a>Olympiads.

    <p id="par245"><sup class="note" id="n131-ref">[131]</sup>When the Greeks &amp; Latines were forming their technical thronology, <a id="l1749"></a>there were great disputes about the antiquity of Rome. The Greeks made it <a id="l1750"></a>much older than the Olympiads. Some of them said it was built by Æneas, o<a id="l1751"></a>thers by Romus the son or grandson of Æneas, others, by Romus the son or grand<a id="l1752"></a>son of Latinus King of the aborigines, others by Romus the son of Vlysses or <a id="l1753"></a>of Ascanius or of Italus. And some of the Latines at first fell in with <a id="l1754"></a>the opinion of the Greeks, saying that it was built by Romulus the son or grand<a id="l1755"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p034r"> &lt;34r&gt; </span> son of Æneas. Timæus Siculus represented it built by Romulus the grand<a id="l1756"></a>son of Æneas, above an hundred years before the Olympiads. And so did <a id="l1757"></a>Nævius the Poet who was twenty years older than Ennius &amp; served in the <a id="l1758"></a>first Punic warr, &amp; wrote the history of that warr. Hitherto nothing certain <a id="l1759"></a>was agreed upon, but about 140 or 150 years after the death of Alexander <a id="l1760"></a>the great they began to say that Rome was built a second time by Romulus <a id="l1761"></a>in the fifteenth age after the destruction of Troy. By ages they meant <a id="l1762"></a>reigns of the Kings of the Latines at Alba, &amp; recconed the first fourteen reigns <a id="l1763"></a>at about 432 years &amp; the following reigns of the seven Kings of Rome at <a id="l1764"></a>244 years, both which  numbers made up the time of <a id="l1765"></a>about 676 years from the taking of Troy according to these chronologers; <a id="l1766"></a>but are much too long for the course of nature. And by this recconing <a id="l1767"></a>they placed the building of Rome upon the sixth or seventh Olympiad. <a id="l1768"></a>Varro placed it on the first year of the seventh Olympiad, &amp; was therein <a id="l1769"></a>generally followed by the Romans. But this can scarce be reconciled to <a id="l1770"></a>the course of nature. For I do not meet  with any instance in all <a id="l1771"></a>history since Chronology was certain, wherein seven Kings (most of whom were <a id="l1772"></a>slain) reigned 244 years in continual succession. The fourteen reigns of <a id="l1773"></a>the Kings of the Latines, at twenty years a piece one with another, amount <a id="l1774"></a>unto 280 years, &amp; these years counted from the taking of Troy end in the <a id="l1775"></a>38<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. And the seven reigns of the Kings of Rome, four or five <a id="l1776"></a>of them being slain &amp; one deposed, may at a moderate recconing amount <a id="l1777"></a>to fifteen or sixteen years a piece one with another. Let them be recconed <a id="l1778"></a>at seventeen years a piece, &amp; they will amount unto 119 years which <a id="l1779"></a>being counted backwards from the regifuge, end also in the 38<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. <a id="l1780"></a>And by these two recconings Rome was built in the 38<sup>th</sup> Olympiad or <a id="l1781"></a>thereabout. The 280 years &amp; the 119 years together make up 399 <a id="l1782"></a>years. And the same number of years arises by counting the twenty <a id="l1783"></a>&amp; one reigns at nineteen years a piece. And this being the whole time <a id="l1784"></a>between the taking of Troy &amp; the regifuge: let these years be counted <a id="l1785"></a>backward from the regifuge, An. 1 Olymp. 68, &amp; they will place the <a id="l1786"></a>taking of Troy about 74 years after the death of Solomon.</p>

Ino was therefore alive in the <a id="l1790"></a>fourteenth year of Rehoboam, the year in which Sesostris returned into Egypt. <a id="l1791"></a>And by consequence her father Cadmus flourished in the reign of David &amp; not <a id="l1792"></a>before.

These generations cannot well be shorter: &amp; therefore Cadmus &amp; his <a id="l1807"></a>son Polydorus were not younger than we have recconed them. Nor can <a id="l1808"></a>they be much  longer without making Polydorus too old to be born in <a id="l1809"></a>Europe &amp; to be the son of Harmonia the sister of Iasion. Labdacus was <a id="l1810"></a>therefore born in the end of David's reign, Laius in the 24<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l1811"></a>Solomon's, &amp; Oedipus in the seventh of Rehoboam's, or thereabout: unless you <a id="l1812"></a>had rather say that Polydorus was born at Sidon before his father came into Europe <a id="l1813"></a>But his name Polydorus is in the language of Greece.</p> 
    <p id="par247">Polydorus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n133-ref">[133]</sup>  married Nicteis the daughter of Nicteus a native of Greece, <a id="l1814"></a>&amp; dying young, left his Kingdom &amp; young son Labdacus under the administration of Nicteus.

<p id="par248">In the days of Erechtheus King of Athens &amp; Celeus King of Eleusis, <a id="l1840"></a>Ceres came into Attica &amp; educated Triptolemus the son of Celeus &amp; taught him <a id="l1841"></a>to sow corn. She<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n137-ref">[137]</sup> lay with Iasion or Iasius the brother of Harmonia the <a id="l1842"></a>wife of Cadmus. And presently after her death Erechtheus was slain in a <a id="l1843"></a>warr between the Athenians &amp; Eleusinians. And for the benefaction of bring<a id="l1844"></a>ing tillage into Greece the Eleusinia sacra were instituted to her<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n138-ref">[138]</sup> with Egypti<a id="l1845"></a>an ceremonies by Celeus &amp; Eumolpus, &amp; a sepulchre  or temple was erec<a id="l1846"></a>ted to her in Eleusine. And in this temple the families of Celeus &amp; Eumolpus <a id="l1847"></a>became her priests. And this temple &amp; that which Erydice erected to her. <a id="l1848"></a>daughter Danae by the name of Iuno Argiva are the first instances that <a id="l1849"></a>I meet with in Greece of deifying the dead with temples &amp; sacred rites &amp; sacri<a id="l1850"></a>fices &amp; initiations &amp; a succession of priests to perform them. Now by this history <a id="l1851"></a>it is manifest that Erechtheus, Celeus, Eumolpus, Ceres, Iasius, Cadmus, <a id="l1852"></a>Harmonia, Asterius, &amp; Dardanus the brother of Iasion  &amp; one of the founders <a id="l1853"></a>of the Kingome of Troy, were all contemporary to one another &amp; flourished <a id="l1854"></a>in their youth when Cadmus came first into Europe. Erechtheus could not be <a id="l1855"></a>much older because his daughter Procris conversed with Minos King of Crete, <a id="l1856"></a>&amp; his grandson Thespis had fifty daughters who lay with Hercules, &amp; his <a id="l1857"></a>daughter Orithia was the mother of Calais &amp; Zetes two of the Argonauts in <a id="l1858"></a>their youth; &amp; his son Orneus <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n139-ref">[139]</sup> was the father of Peteos, the father of Menes<a id="l1859"></a>theus who warred at Troy: nor much younger because his second son <a id="l1860"></a>Pandion ( who with the Metionides deposed his elder brother Cecrops,) was <a id="l1861"></a>the father of Ægeus the father of Theseus, &amp; Metion another of his sons <a id="l1862"></a>was the father of Eupalamus the father of Dædalus who was older than <a id="l1863"></a>Theseus, &amp;  his daughter Creusa married Xuthus <a id="l1864"></a>the son of Hellen, &amp; by him had two sons Achæus &amp; Ion, &amp; Ion commanded <a id="l1865"></a>the army of the Athenians against the Eleusinians in the battle in which <a id="l1866"></a>his grandfather Erechtheus was slain; &amp; this was just before the institu<a id="l1867"></a>tion of the Eleusinia sacra, &amp; before the reign of Pandion the father of Ægeus. <a id="l1868"></a>Erechtheus being an Egyptian procured corn from Egypt, &amp; for that benefaction <a id="l1869"></a>was made King of Athens. And neare the beginning of his reign Ceres came <a id="l1870"></a>into Attica from Sicily in quest of her daughter Proserpina.

<p id="par252">Danaus came into Greece a year or two after the return of his <a id="l1931"></a>brother Sesac into Ægypt, that is, about the fifteenth or sixteenth year of <a id="l1932"></a>Rehoboam. At length he succeeded Gelanor the brother of Eurysthens at Argos <a id="l1933"></a>while Eurystheus reigned at Mycenes, &amp; Eurystheus was born <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n143-ref">[143]</sup> the same <a id="l1934"></a>year with Hercules.

All <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p037r"> &lt;37r&gt; </span> these with the Argonauts Lynceus &amp; Idas were the grandchildren <a id="l1937"></a>of Gorgophone the daughter of Perseus the son of Danae the daughter <a id="l1938"></a> of Acrisius &amp; Eurydice. And Perieres &amp; Oebalus the husbands <a id="l1939"></a>of Gorgophone were the sons of Cynortes the son of Amyclas the brother <a id="l1940"></a>of Eurydice. Gelanor &amp; Eurystheus above mentioned were the sons of Sthe<a id="l1941"></a>nelus by Nicippe the daughter of Pelops. And Mestor or Mastor the brother <a id="l1942"></a>of Sthenelus married Lysidice another of the daughters of Pelops. And Pelops married <a id="l1943"></a>Hippodamia the daughter of Evarete the daughter of Acrisius. Alcmena the <a id="l1944"></a>mother of Hercules was the daughter of Electryo. And Sthenelus Mestor &amp; <a id="l1945"></a>Electryo were the brothers of Gorgophone &amp; sons of Perseus &amp; Andromeda. <a id="l1946"></a>And the Argonaut Æsculapius was the grandson of Leucippus &amp; Phlegia, &amp; <a id="l1947"></a>Leucippus was the  son of Amyclas the brother of Eurydice, &amp; Amyclas <a id="l1948"></a>&amp; Eurydice were the children of Lacedæmon &amp; Sparta.

And from these generations it <a id="l1952"></a>may be gathered that Perseus, Cynorles &amp; Anaxagoras were of about <a id="l1953"></a>the same age with Minos, Pelops, Ægeus &amp; Sesac: &amp; that Acrisius, Prætus, <a id="l1954"></a>Eurydice &amp; Amyclas being two little generations older were of about the <a id="l1955"></a>same age with King David &amp; Erechtheus : &amp; that the temple of  <a id="l1956"></a>Iuno Argiva was built about the latter end of Davids reign or the beginning <a id="l1957"></a>of Solomon's; the same being built by Eurydice to her daughter Danae, as <a id="l1958"></a>above, or as some say by Pirasus or Piranthus the son &amp; successor of Argus <a id="l1959"></a>&amp; great grandson of Phoroneus. For the first priestess of that Goddess was <a id="l1960"></a>Callithyia the daughter of  Piranthus. Callithyia was succeeded <a id="l1961"></a>by Alcinoe about three generations before the taking of Troy, that is about <a id="l1962"></a>the middle of Solomons reign. In her priesthood the Siculi passed out of <a id="l1963"></a>Italy into Sicily. Afterwards Hypermnestra the daughter of Danaus be<a id="l1964"></a>came priestess of this Goddess, &amp; she flourished in the times next after <a id="l1965"></a>the Argonautic expedition. And Admeta the daughter of Euristheus was <a id="l1966"></a>priestess of this Iuno about the times of the Trojan warr. Andromeda the <a id="l1967"></a>wife of Perseus was the daughter of Cepheus an Egyptian the son of <a id="l1968"></a>Belus (according to <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n144-ref">[144]</sup>  Herodotus) &amp; the Ægyptian Belus was Ammon. Perseus <a id="l1969"></a>took her from Ioppa where Cepheus (I think a kinsman of Solomons <a id="l1970"></a>Queen) resided in the days of Solomon. Acrisius &amp; Prætus were the sons <a id="l1971"></a>of Abas. But this Abas was not the same man with Abas the grandson <a id="l1972"></a>of Ægyptus, but a much older Prince who built Abæa in Phocis, &amp; might <a id="l1973"></a>be the prince from whom the island Eubœa <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n145-ref">[145]</sup> was anciently called Abantis <a id="l1974"></a>&amp; the people thereof Abantes. For Apollonius Rhodius <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n146-ref">[146]</sup> tells us that the <a id="l1975"></a>Argonaut Canthus was the son of Canethus, &amp; that Canethus was of the <a id="l1976"></a>posterity of Abas, &amp; the Commentator upon Apollonius tells us further <a id="l1977"></a>that from this Abas the inhabitants of Eubœa were anciently called Aban<a id="l1978"></a>tes. This Abas therefore flourished three or four generations before the <a id="l1979"></a>Argonautic expedition &amp; so might be the father of Acrisius. The ancestors <a id="l1980"></a>of Acrisius <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n147-ref">[147]</sup> were accounted Ægyptians by the Greeks. And they might come <a id="l1981"></a>from Egypt under Abas into Eubæa &amp; from thence into Peloponnesus. Among <a id="l1982"></a>the kings of Argos are recconed Sthenelus the son of Perseus &amp; Gelanor <a id="l1983"></a>the son of Sthenelus; but Gelanor was ejected by Danaus in the beginning <a id="l1984"></a>of his reign. And after Danaus reigned his son Lynceus &amp; grandson Abas, <a id="l1985"></a>that Abas who is commonly but erroneously reputed the father of Acrisius <a id="l1986"></a>&amp; Prætus. I do not reccon Phorbas &amp; his son Triopas among the Kings of Argos <a id="l1987"></a>because they fled from that kingdom to the island Rhodes, nor do I reccon <a id="l1988"></a>Crotopus among them because he went from Argos &amp; built a new city <a id="l1989"></a>for himself in Megaris as <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n148-ref">[148]</sup> Conon relates.</p>
    <p id="par253">Pelops <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n149-ref">[149]</sup> came into Peloponesus in the days of Acrisius &amp; in those of Endymion <a id="l1990"></a>&amp; of his sons, Epeus &amp; Ælolus, &amp; took Ætolia from Ætolus. Endymion was the son <a id="l1991"></a>of AEthlius the son of Protogenia the sister of Hellen &amp; daughter of Deucalion. <a id="l1992"></a>Phrixus &amp; Helle the children of Athamas the brother of Sisyphus &amp; son of <a id="l1993"></a>Æolus the son of Hellen fled from their stepmother Ino the daughter of Cadmus <a id="l1994"></a>to Æetes at Colchos presently after the return of Sesostris into ÆEgypt. And <a id="l1995"></a>Iason the Argonaut was the son of Æson the son of Critheus the son of Æolus <a id="l1996"></a>the son of Hellen. And Calyce was the wife of Aëthlius and mother of Endy<a id="l1997"></a>mion &amp; daughter of Æolus &amp; sister of Critheus Sisyphus &amp; Athamas. And by <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p038r"> &lt;38r&gt; </span> these circumstances Critheus Sisyphus &amp; Athamas flourished in the latter <a id="l1998"></a>part of the reign of Solomon &amp; in the reign of Rhehoboam. Aëthlius, Æolus, Xuthus, <a id="l1999"></a>Dorus, Tantalus &amp; Danae were contemporary to Erechtheus, Iasion &amp; Cadmus; <a id="l2000"></a>&amp; Hellen was about one &amp; Deucalion about two generations older than <a id="l2001"></a>Erechtheus. They could not be much older because Xuthus the youngest son <a id="l2002"></a>of Hellen <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n150-ref">[150]</sup> married Creusa the daughter of Erechtheus. Nor could they <a id="l2003"></a>be much younger because Cephalus the son of Deioneus the son of Æolus <a id="l2004"></a>the eldest son of Hellen <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n151-ref">[151]</sup> married Procris the daughter of Erechtheus, &amp; Procris  fled from her husband to Minos. Vpon the death of <a id="l2005"></a>Hellen his youngest son <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n152-ref">[152]</sup> Xuthus was expelled Thessaly by his brothers <a id="l2006"></a>Æolus &amp; Dorus, &amp; fled to Erechtheus &amp; married Creusa the daughter <a id="l2007"></a>of Erechtheus by whom he had two sons Achæus &amp; Ion, the youngest <a id="l2008"></a>of which grew up before the death of Erechtheus &amp; commanded the <a id="l2009"></a>army of the Athenians in the war in which Erechtheus was slain. And <a id="l2010"></a>therefore Hellen died about one generation before Erechtheus.</p> 
<p id="par254">Sisyphus therefore built Corinth about the latter end of the <a id="l2011"></a>reign of Solomon or the beginning of the reign of Rehoboam. Vpon the <a id="l2012"></a>flight of Phrixus &amp; Helle, their father Athamas, a little King in Bœotia, <a id="l2013"></a>went distracted &amp; slew his son Learchus, &amp; his wife Ino  threw her self into the sea together <a id="l2015"></a>with her other son Melicertus. And thereupon Sisyphus instituted the <a id="l2016"></a>isthmia at Corinth to his nephew Melicertus. This was presently after <a id="l2017"></a>Sesostris had left Æetes at Colchis, I think in the fifteenth or sixteenth <a id="l2018"></a>year of Rehoboam. So then Athamas the son of Æolus &amp; grandson of <a id="l2019"></a>Hellen &amp; Ino the daughter of Cadmus flourished till about the sixteenth <a id="l2020"></a>year of Rehoboam. Sisyphus &amp; his successors Ornytion, Thoas, Demo<a id="l2021"></a>phaon, Propadas, Doradas &amp; Hyanthidus reigned successively at Corinth <a id="l2022"></a>till the return of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus. Then reigned the Heraclides <a id="l2023"></a>Aletes, Ixion, Agelas, Prumnes, Bacchis, Agelas II, Eudamus, Aristodemus, &amp; <a id="l2024"></a>Telestes successively about  170 years, &amp; then Corinth was governed by Prytanes or annual <a id="l2025"></a>Archons about 40 or 50 years, &amp; after them by Cypselus &amp; Periander about <a id="l2026"></a>50 years more.</p> 
<p id="par255">Celeus King of Eleusis who was contemporary to Erechtheus was <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n153-ref">[153]</sup> the son <a id="l2027"></a>of  Rharus the son of Cranaus the successor of Cecrops; &amp; in the reign <a id="l2028"></a>of Cranaus, Deucalion fled with his sons Hellen &amp; Amphictyon from the flood which <a id="l2029"></a>then overflowed Thessaly, &amp; was called Deucalions flood. They fled into Attica, <a id="l2030"></a>&amp; there Deucalion died soon after: And Pausanias tells us that his sepulchre was <a id="l2031"></a>to be seen near Athens. His eldest son Hellen succeeded him in Thessaly, &amp; <a id="l2032"></a>his other son Amphictyon married the daughter of Cranaus, &amp; reigning at Thermo<a id="l2033"></a>pylæ, erected there the Amphictyonic council: &amp; Acrisius soon after erected <a id="l2034"></a>the like Council at Delphos. This I conceive was done when Amphictyon &amp; Acrisius <a id="l2035"></a>were aged &amp; fit to be councellours; suppose in the latter half of the reign of David <a id="l2036"></a>&amp; beginning of the reign of Solomon. And soon after, suppose about the middle of the <a id="l2037"></a>reign of Solomon, did Phemonoe become the first Priestess of Apollo at Delphos, &amp; gave <a id="l2038"></a>Oracles in hexameter verse: &amp; then was Acrisius slain by his grandson Perseus.

<p id="par260">The two first Kings of Crete who reigned after the coming of the Curetes, <a id="l2125"></a>were Asterius &amp; Minos.

The Eleans <sup>d</sup> said <a id="l2254"></a>also that Clymenus the grandson of the Idæan Hercules, about fifty years after <a id="l2255"></a>Deucalion's flood, coming from Crete, celebrated these games again in Olympia, <a id="l2256"></a>&amp; erected there an altar to Iuno Olympia, that is, to Europa, &amp; another to this <a id="l2257"></a>Hercules &amp; the rest of the Curetes, &amp; reigned in Elis till he was expelled by En<a id="l2258"></a>dymion, <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n192-ref">[192]</sup> who thereupon celebrated these games again. And so did Pelops who <a id="l2259"></a>expelled Ætolus the son of Endymion; &amp; so also did Hercules the son of Alcmena, <a id="l2260"></a>&amp; Atreus the son of Pelops, &amp; Oxylus. They might be celebrated originally in <a id="l2261"></a>triumph for victories, first by Hercules Idæus upon the conquest of Saturn &amp; the <a id="l2262"></a>Titans, &amp; there by Climenus upon his coming to reign in the <em class="underline">terra Curetum</em>. <a id="l2263"></a>Then by Endymion upon his conquering Clymenus; &amp; afterwards by Pelops upon <a id="l2264"></a>his conquering Ætolus, &amp; by Hercules upon his killing Augeas, &amp; by Atreus upon <a id="l2265"></a>his repelling the Heraclides,&amp; by Oxylus upon the return of the Heraclides <a id="l2266"></a>into Peloponesus. This Iupiter to whom they were instituted had a temple &amp; altar <a id="l2267"></a>erected to him in Olympia where the games were celebrated, &amp; from the place <a id="l2268"></a>was called Iupiter Olympius. Olympia was a place upon the confines of <a id="l2269"></a>Pisa neare the river Alpheus.</p> 
    <p id="par264">In the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n193-ref">[193]</sup> Island Thasus where Cadmus left his brother Thasus the Phenicians <a id="l2270"></a>built a temple to Hercules Olympius, that Hercules whom Cicero <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n194-ref">[194]</sup> calls <em class="underline">ex Idæis cui <a id="l2271"></a>inferias afferunt</em>. When the mysteries of Ceres were instituted in Eleusis, there <a id="l2272"></a>were other mysteries instituted to her &amp; her daughter &amp; daughters husband in the <a id="l2273"></a>island Samothrace by the Phenician names of Dij Cabiri Axieros Axiokersa, &amp; Axiokerses, that is the great Gods Ceres, Proserpina &amp; Pluto. For <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n195-ref">[195]</sup> Iasion a <a id="l2274"></a>Samothracian whose sister married Cadmus, was familiar with Ceres; &amp; Cadmus <a id="l2275"></a>&amp; Iasion were both of them instituted in these mysteries. Iasion was the brother <a id="l2276"></a>of Dardanus, &amp; married Cybele the daughter of Meones King of Phrygia, &amp; by her <a id="l2277"></a>had Corybas; &amp; after his death, Dardanus, Cybele &amp; Corybas went into Phrygia, &amp; <a id="l2278"></a>carried thither the  mysteries of the mother of the Gods, &amp; Cybele <a id="l2279"></a>called the  goddess after her own name, &amp; Corybas called her priests Corybantes. <a id="l2280"></a>Thus Diodorus. But Dionysius saith <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n196-ref">[196]</sup> that Dardanus instituted the Samothracian mys<a id="l2281"></a>teries &amp; that his wife Chryses learnt them in Arcadia, &amp; that Idæus the son of Dar<a id="l2282"></a>danus instituted afterwards the mysteries of the mother of the Gods in Phrygia. <a id="l2283"></a>This Phrygian Godess was drawn in a chariot by lions, &amp; had a <em class="underline">corona turrita</em> on <a id="l2284"></a>her head &amp; a drum in her hand like the Phœnician Godess Astarte, &amp; the Cory<a id="l2285"></a>bantes danced in armour at her sacrifices in a furious manner like the <a id="l2286"></a>Idæi Dactyli; &amp; Lucian <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n197-ref">[197]</sup> tells us that she was the Cretan Rhea, that is, Europa <a id="l2287"></a>the mother of Minos. And thus the Phenicians introduced the practice of deify<a id="l2288"></a>ing dead men &amp; weomen  among the Greeks and Phrygians. <a id="l2289"></a>For I meet with no instance of deifying dead men &amp; women in Greece <a id="l2290"></a>before the coming of Cadmus &amp; Europa from Sidon.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p043r"> &lt;43r&gt; </span>
<p id="par265">From these originals it came  into fashion among the Greeks <a id="l2291"></a>κτεριζειν, parentare, to celebrate the funerals of dead parents with festi<a id="l2292"></a>valls &amp; invocations &amp; sacrifices offered to their ghosts, &amp; to erect magnificent <a id="l2293"></a>sepulchres in the form of temples with altars &amp; statues to persons of re<a id="l2294"></a>nown; &amp; there to honour them publickly with sacrifices &amp; invocations. <a id="l2295"></a>Every man might do it to his ancestors, &amp; the cities of Greece did it to all the <a id="l2296"></a>eminent Greeks: as to Europa the sister, to Alymnus the brother &amp; to Minos <a id="l2297"></a>&amp; Rhadamanthus the nephews of Cadmus; to his daughter Ino &amp; her son <a id="l2298"></a>Melicertus; to Bacchus the son of his daughter Semele, Aristarchus the <a id="l2299"></a>husband of his daughter Autonoe, Iasion the brother of his wife harmonia, <a id="l2300"></a>Hercules a Theban, &amp; his mother Alcmena; to Danae the daughter of Acri<a id="l2301"></a>sius; to Æsculapius &amp; Polemocrates the son of Machaon; to Pandion &amp; <a id="l2302"></a>Theseus Kings of Athens, Hippolytus the son of Theseus, Pan the son of <a id="l2303"></a>Penelope, Proserpina, Triptolemus, Celeus, Trophonius, Castor, Pollux, <a id="l2304"></a>Helena, Menelaus, Agamemnon, Amphiaraus &amp; his son Amphilochus, <a id="l2305"></a>Hector &amp; Alexandra the son &amp; daughter of Priam, Phoroneus, Orpheus, <a id="l2306"></a>Protesilaus, Achilles &amp; his mother Thetis, Ajax, Arcas, Idomeneus, <a id="l2307"></a>Meriones, Æacus, Melampus, Britomartis, Adrastus, Iolaus, &amp; divers <a id="l2308"></a>others. They deified their dead in divers manners according to their abili<a id="l2309"></a>ties &amp; circumstances &amp; the merits of the person; some only in private fa<a id="l2310"></a>milies, as houshold Gods or Dij Pænates, others by erecting gravestones to them <a id="l2311"></a>in publick to be used as altars for annual sacrifices, others by building <a id="l2312"></a>also to them sepulchres in the form of houses or temples, &amp; some by <a id="l2313"></a>appointing mysteries, &amp; ceremonies, &amp; set sacrifices, &amp; festivalls, &amp; initiations, &amp; <a id="l2314"></a>a succession of priests for performing those institutions in the temples, &amp; handing <a id="l2315"></a>them down to posterity. Altars might begin to be erected in Europe a little <a id="l2316"></a>before the days of Cadmus for sacrificing to the old God or Gods of the Colonies, <a id="l2317"></a>but Temples began in the days of Solomon. For <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n198-ref">[198]</sup> Æacus the son of Ægina, <a id="l2318"></a>who was two generations older than the Trojan warr, is by some reputed <a id="l2319"></a>one of the first who built a temple in Greece. Oracles came first from Egypt into <a id="l2320"></a>Greece about the same time, as also did the custome of forming the images <a id="l2321"></a>of  the Gods with their leggs bound up in the shape of the <a id="l2322"></a>Egyptian  mummies. For Idolatry began in Chaldæa &amp; Egypt, <a id="l2323"></a>&amp; spread thence into Phœnicia &amp; the neighbouring countries long be<a id="l2324"></a>fore it came into Europe; &amp; the Pelasgians propagated it in Greece <a id="l2325"></a>by the dictates of the Oracles. The countries upon the Tigris &amp; the <a id="l2326"></a>Nile being exceding fertile, were first frequented by mankind, &amp; grew <a id="l2327"></a>first into Kingdoms, &amp; therefore began first to adore their dead Kings <a id="l2328"></a>&amp; queens. Hence came the Gods of Laban, the Gods <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp; Go<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>desses called Baaalim <a id="l2329"></a>&amp; Ashtaroth by the Canaanites, the dæmons or Gh<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>osts<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> to whom they sacri<a id="l2330"></a>ficed, &amp; the Moloch to whom they offered their <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>chil<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>dren in the days of <a id="l2331"></a>Moses &amp; the Iudges.

The kingdom of the lower Egypt began to worship their Kings before the days of Moses; and to this worship the  second commandment <a id="l2335"></a>is opposed. When the shepherds invaded the lower Egypt, they checqued <a id="l2336"></a>this worship of the  old Egyptians &amp; spread that of their own kings. <a id="l2337"></a>And at length the Egyptians of Coptos &amp; Thebais under Misphragmu<a id="l2338"></a>thosis &amp; Amosis expelling the shepherds, checqued the worship of the <a id="l2339"></a>Gods of the Shepherds, &amp; deifying their own kings &amp; princes propa<a id="l2340"></a>gated the worship of twelve of them into their conquests &amp; made them <a id="l2341"></a>more universal than the false Gods of any other nation had been <a id="l2342"></a>before, so as to be called <em class="underline">Dij magni majorum gentium</em>. Sesostris con<a id="l2343"></a>quered Thrace, &amp; Amphictyon the son of Prometheus brought the twelve <a id="l2344"></a>Gods from Thrace into Greece. Herodotus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n199-ref">[199]</sup> tells us that they came <a id="l2345"></a>from Egypt. And by the names of the cities of Egypt dedicated to many of <a id="l2346"></a>these Gods you may know that they were of an Egyptian original. And <a id="l2347"></a>the Egyptians (according to Diodorus <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n200-ref">[200]</sup>) usually represented, that after <a id="l2348"></a>their Saturn &amp; Rhea reigned Iupiter &amp; Iuno, the parents of Osiris &amp; Isis, <a id="l2349"></a>the parents of Orus &amp; Bubaste.</p> 
    <p id="par266">By all this it may be understood that as the Egyptians who <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p044r"> &lt;44r&gt; </span> deified their kings, began their monarchy with the reign of their Gods <a id="l2350"></a>&amp; Heros, recconing Menes the first man who reigned after their Gods; so <a id="l2351"></a>the Cretans had the ages of their Gods &amp; Heros, calling the first four ages of <a id="l2352"></a>their deified kings &amp; princes the golden, silver, brazen, &amp; iron ages. Hesiod <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n201-ref">[201]</sup> describing <a id="l2353"></a>these four ages of the Gods &amp; Demigods of Greece, represents them to be four ge<a id="l2354"></a>nerations of men each of which ended when the men then living grew old &amp; <a id="l2355"></a>dropt into the grave, &amp; tells us that the fourth ended with the warrs of Thebes <a id="l2356"></a>&amp; Troy. And so many generations there were from the coming of the Phe Pœnici<a id="l2357"></a>ans &amp; Curetes with Cadmus &amp; Europa into Greece unto the destruction of <a id="l2358"></a>Troy. Apollonius Rhodius saith that when the Argonauts came to Crete, <a id="l2359"></a>they slew Talus a brazen man who remained of those that were of the <a id="l2360"></a>brazen age &amp; guarded that pass. Talus was reputed <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n202-ref">[202]</sup> the son of Minos, &amp; <a id="l2361"></a>therefore the sons of Minos lived in the brazen age, &amp; Minos reigned in <a id="l2362"></a>the silver age. It was the silver age of the Greeks in which they began <a id="l2363"></a>to plow &amp; sow corn, &amp; Ceres that taught them to do it flourished in the <a id="l2364"></a>reign of Celeus Erechtheus &amp; Minos. Mythologists tell us that the last <a id="l2365"></a>woman with whom Iupiter lay, was Alcmena: &amp; thereby they seem to <a id="l2366"></a>put an end to the reign of Iupiter among mortals (that is to the silver <a id="l2367"></a>age) when Alcmena was with child of Hercules, who therefore was <a id="l2368"></a>born about the eighth or tenth year of Rehoboams reign, &amp; was of about <a id="l2369"></a>34 years old at the time of the Argonautic expedition. Chiron was <a id="l2370"></a>begot by Saturn of Philyra in the golden age when Iupiter was a child <a id="l2371"></a>in the Cretan cave as above; &amp; this was in the reign of  As<a id="l2372"></a>terius King of Crete. And therefore Asterius reigned in Crete in the <a id="l2373"></a>golden age, &amp; the silver age began when Chiron was a child. If Chiron <a id="l2374"></a>was born about the 35<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign, he will be born in the Reign of Asterius when <a id="l2375"></a>Iupiter was a child in the Cretan Cave, &amp; be about 88 years old in <a id="l2376"></a>the time of the Argonautic expedition when he invented the aste<a id="l2377"></a>risms. And this is within the reach of nature. The golden age therefore <a id="l2378"></a>falls in with the reign of Asterius, &amp; the silver age with that of Minos. <a id="l2379"></a>And to make these ages much longer than ordinary generations is to <a id="l2380"></a>make Chiron live much longer than according to the course of nature. <a id="l2381"></a>This fable of the four ages seems to have been made by the Curetes in <a id="l2382"></a>the fourth age in memory of the first four ages of their coming into <a id="l2383"></a>Europe as into a new world, &amp; in honour of their country woman <a id="l2384"></a>Europa, &amp; her husband Asterius the Saturn of the Latines, &amp; of her <a id="l2385"></a>son Minos the Cretan Iupiter, &amp; grandson Deucalion who reigned <a id="l2386"></a>till the Argonautic expedition &amp; is sometimes recconed among <a id="l2387"></a>the Argonauts, &amp; of their great grandson Idomeneus who warred <a id="l2388"></a>at Troy. Hesiod tells us that he himself lived in the fifth age, the age <a id="l2389"></a>next after the taking of Troy, &amp; therefore he flourished within thirty <a id="l2390"></a>or thirty five yeares after it. And Homer was of about the same age. For he <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n203-ref">[203]</sup> lived <a id="l2391"></a>sometime with Mentor in Ithaca &amp; there <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n204-ref">[204]</sup> learnt of him many things con<a id="l2392"></a>cerning Vlysses, with whom Mentor had been personally acquainted: now Herodotus, the oldest Historian of the Greeks now extant, <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n205-ref">[205]</sup> tells us that <a id="l2393"></a>Hesiod &amp; Homer were not above four hundred years older than him<a id="l2394"></a>self, &amp; therefore they flourished within 110 or 120 years after the death <a id="l2395"></a>of Solomon. And according to my recconing the taking of Troy was <a id="l2396"></a>but one generation earlier.</p> 
<p id="par267">Mythologists tell us that Niobe the daughter of Phoroneus was the first <a id="l2397"></a>woman with whom Iupiter lay, &amp; that of her he begat Argus, who succeeded <a id="l2398"></a>Phoroneus in the Kingdom of Argos &amp; gave his name to that city. And therefore <a id="l2399"></a>Argus was born in the beginning of the silver age, unless you had rather say that <a id="l2400"></a>by Iupiter they might here mean Asterius. For the Phenicians gave the name <a id="l2401"></a>of Iupiter to every king from the time of their first coming  into Greece <a id="l2402"></a>with Cadmus &amp; Europa untill the invasion of Greece by Sesostris &amp; the birth of <a id="l2403"></a>Hercules, &amp; particularly to the fathers of Minos, Pelops, Lacedæmon, Æacus, &amp; <a id="l2404"></a>Perseus.</p> 
<p id="par268">The four first ages succeeded the flood of Deucalion; &amp; some tell us <a id="l2405"></a>that Deucalion was the son of Prometheus, the son of Iapetus, &amp; brother of Atlas. But this was another Deucalion. For Iapetus the father of Prome<a id="l2406"></a>theus, Epimetheus, &amp; Atlas was an Egyptian the brother of Osiris, &amp; flourished <a id="l2407"></a>two generations after the flood of Deucalion.</p> 
<span class="pagenumber" id="p045r"> &lt;45r&gt; </span>
<p id="par269">I have now carried up the chronology of the Greeks as high as to the <a id="l2408"></a>first use of letters, the first plowing &amp; sowing of corn, the first manufacturing <a id="l2409"></a>of copper &amp; iron, the beginning of the trades of Smiths, Carpenters, Ioyners, Turners, <a id="l2410"></a>Brick makers, Stone cutters, &amp; Potters in Europe : the first walling of cities about, <a id="l2411"></a>the first building of temples, &amp; the original of Oracles in Greece; the beginning <a id="l2412"></a>of navigation by the starrs in long ships with sails; the erecting of the Amphic<a id="l2413"></a>tyonic Councils; the first ages of Greece called the golden silver copper &amp; iron <a id="l2414"></a>ages, &amp; the flood of Deucalion which immediately preceded them. Those ages <a id="l2415"></a> could not be earlier than the invention &amp; use of the four metals <a id="l2416"></a>in Greece from whence they had their names; &amp; the flood of Ogyges could <a id="l2417"></a>not be much above two or three ages earlier than that of Deualion. For <a id="l2418"></a>among such wandering people as were then in Europe, there could be no <a id="l2419"></a>memory of things done above three or four ages before the first use of letters. And <a id="l2420"></a>the expulsion of the shepherds out of Egypt, which gave the first occasion to the coming <a id="l2421"></a>of people from Egypt into Greece, &amp; to the building of houses &amp; villages in Greece, was <a id="l2422"></a>scarce earlier than the days of Eli &amp; Samuel. For Manetho tells us that when they <a id="l2423"></a>were forced to quit Abaris &amp; retire out of Egypt, they went through the wilderness <a id="l2424"></a>into Iudæa &amp; built Ierusalem. I do not think with Manetho that they were the <a id="l2425"></a>Israelites under Moses but rather believe that they were Canaanites, &amp; upon <a id="l2426"></a>leaving Abaris mingled with the Philistims their next neighbours; though some <a id="l2427"></a>of them might assist David &amp; Solomon in building Ierusalem &amp; the Temple.</p> 
<p id="par270">Saul was made King <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n206-ref">[206]</sup> that he might rescue Israel out of the hand of the <a id="l2428"></a>Philistims who opressed them. And in the second year of his reign, the Philistims <a id="l2429"></a>brought into the field against him, thirty thousand chariots, &amp; six thousand hors<a id="l2430"></a>men, &amp; foot without number; &amp; the Canaanites had their horses from Egypt. <a id="l2431"></a>And yet in the days of Moses all the chariots of Egypt with which Pharaoh <a id="l2432"></a>pursued Israel were but six hundred. Exod. xiv. 7. From the great army <a id="l2433"></a>of the Philistims against Saul, &amp; the great number of their horses, I seem <a id="l2434"></a>to gather that the shepherds had newly relinquished Egypt &amp; joyned them. <a id="l2435"></a>The Shepherds might be beaten &amp; driven out of the greatest part of Egypt, &amp; <a id="l2436"></a>shut up in Abaris by Mesphramuthosis in the latter end of the days of Eli; <a id="l2437"></a>&amp; some of them fly to the Philistims &amp; strengthen them against Israel in <a id="l2438"></a>the last year of Eli. And from the Philistims some of the shepherds might <a id="l2439"></a>go to Zidon, &amp; from Zidon by sea to Asia minor &amp; Greece. And afterwards <a id="l2440"></a>in the beginning of the reign of Saul the shepherds who still remained in <a id="l2441"></a>Egypt might be forced by Thummosis or Amosis the son of Mesphramu<a id="l2442"></a>thosis, to leave Abaris &amp; retire in very great numbers to the Philistims. <a id="l2443"></a>And upon these occasions several of them, as Pelasgus, Inachus, Lelex, Cecrops, <a id="l2444"></a>&amp; Abas might come with their people by sea from Egypt to Sidon &amp; Cyprus &amp; <a id="l2445"></a>thence to Asia minor &amp; Greece in the days of Eli Samuel &amp; Saul, &amp; thereby <a id="l2446"></a>begin to open a commerce by sea between Sidon &amp; Greece before the revolt of <a id="l2447"></a>Edom from Iudæa, &amp; the final coming of the Phœnicians from the red sea.</p> 
<p id="par271">Pelasgus reigned in Arcadia &amp; was the father of Lycaon (according <a id="l2448"></a>to Pherecides Atheniensis,) &amp; Lycaon died just before the flood of Deucalion. <a id="l2449"></a>And therefore his father Pelasgus might come into Greece about two generations <a id="l2450"></a>before Cadmus, or in the latter end of the days of Eli, Lycaon, sacrificed chil<a id="l2451"></a>dren, &amp; therefore his father might come with his people from the shepherds <a id="l2452"></a>in Egypt, &amp; perhaps from the regions of Heliopolis where they sacrificed <a id="l2453"></a>men, till Amosis Abolished that custome. Mephramuthosis the father of <a id="l2454"></a>Amosis drove the shepherds out of a great part of Egypt &amp; shut the remain<a id="l2455"></a>der up in Abaris. And then great numbers might escape to Greece: some <a id="l2456"></a>from the regions of Heliopolis under Pelasgus, &amp; others from Memphis <a id="l2457"></a>&amp; other places under other Captains. And hence it might come to pass that <a id="l2458"></a>the Pelasgians were at the first very numerous in Greece &amp; spake a <a id="l2459"></a>different language from the Greek, &amp; were the ringleaders in bringing <a id="l2460"></a>into Greece the worship of the dead.</p> 
<p id="par272">Inachus is called the son of Oceanus perhaps because he came <a id="l2461"></a>to Greece by sea. He might come with his people to Argos from Egypt in the <a id="l2462"></a>days of Eli; &amp; seat himself upon the river Inachus so named from him, <a id="l2463"></a>&amp; leave his territories to his sons Phoroneus, Ægialeus, &amp; Phegeus, in the days <a id="l2464"></a>of Samuel. For Car the son of Phoroneus built a temple to Ceres in Megara, <a id="l2465"></a>&amp; therefore was contemporary to Erechtheus. Phoroneus reigned at Argos, <a id="l2466"></a>&amp; Ægialeus at Sicyon, &amp; founded those Kingdoms. And yet Ægialeus is made <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p046r"> &lt;46r&gt; </span> above five hundred years older than Phoroneus by some Chronolo<a id="l2467"></a>gers.

Ægialeus died without issue, &amp; after him reigned Europs, Tel<a id="l2470"></a>chin, Apis, Lamedon, Sicyon, Polybus, Adrastus &amp; Agamemnon &amp;c. And Sicyon <a id="l2471"></a>gave his name to the Kingdom. Herodotus <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n211-ref">[211]</sup> saith that Apis in the Greek tongue <a id="l2472"></a>is Epaphus, &amp; Hygenus <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n212-ref">[212]</sup> that Epaphus the Sicyonian got Antiopa with child. <a id="l2473"></a>But the later Greeks have made two men of the two names Apis &amp; Epaphus <a id="l2474"></a>or Epopeus, &amp; between them inserted twelve feigned kings of Sicyon who <a id="l2475"></a>made no warrs nor did any thing memorable &amp; yet reigned five hun<a id="l2476"></a>dred &amp; twenty years, which is one with another above forty &amp; three -<a id="l2477"></a>years a piece. If these feigned kings be rejected, &amp; the two kings Apis &amp; Epopeus be reunited; Ægialeus will become contemporary to his <a id="l2478"></a>brother Phoroneus, as he ought to be. For Apis or Epopeus &amp; Nicteus the <a id="l2479"></a>guardian of Labdacus, were slain in battle about the tenth year of So<a id="l2480"></a>lomon as above; &amp; the first four kings of Sicyon, Ægialeus, Europs, Telchin, <a id="l2481"></a>Apis, after the rate of about twenty years to a reign, take up about <a id="l2482"></a>eighty years. And these years counted upwards from the tenth year <a id="l2483"></a>of Solomon place the beginning of the reign of Ægialeus upon the <a id="l2484"></a>twelfth year of Samuel or thereabout. And about that time began the <a id="l2485"></a>reign of Phoroneus at Argos. Apollodorus <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n213-ref">[213]</sup> calls Adrastus King of Argos: <a id="l2486"></a>but Homer tells <sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n214-ref">[214]</sup> us that he reigned first at Sicyon. He was in the first <a id="l2487"></a>war against Thebes. Some place Ianiscus &amp; Phæstus between <a id="l2488"></a>Polybus &amp; Adrastus, but without any certainty.</p> 
<p id="par273">Lelex might come with his people into Laconia in the days <a id="l2489"></a>of Eli, &amp; leave his territories to his sons Myles, Eurotas, Cleson, &amp; <a id="l2490"></a>Polycaon in the days of Samuel. Myles set up a quern or hand<a id="l2491"></a>mill to grind corn, &amp; is reputed the first among the Greeks who <a id="l2492"></a>did so: but he flourished before Triptolemus, &amp; seems to have had his <a id="l2493"></a>corn &amp; artificers from Egypt. Eurotas the brother or as some say <a id="l2494"></a>the son of Myles, built Sparta, &amp; called it after the name of his <a id="l2495"></a>daughter Sparta the wife of Lacedæmon &amp; mother of Eurydice. <a id="l2496"></a>Cleson was the father of Pylas the father of Scyron who married <a id="l2497"></a>the daughter of Pandion the son of Erechtheus, &amp; contended with <a id="l2498"></a>Nisus the son of Pandion &amp; brother of  Ægeus for the <a id="l2499"></a>kingdom; &amp; Æacus adjudged it to Nisus. Polycaon invaded Messene <a id="l2500"></a>then peopled only by villages, &amp; called it Messene after the name <a id="l2501"></a>of his wife, &amp; built cities therein.</p> 
<p id="par274">Cecrops came from Sais in Egypt to Cyprus, &amp; thence into <a id="l2502"></a>Attica. And he might do this in the days of Samuel, &amp; marry <a id="l2503"></a>Agraulos the daughter of Actæus, &amp; succeed him in Attica soon <a id="l2504"></a>after, &amp; leave his kingdom to Cranaus in the reign of Saul, or in <a id="l2505"></a>the beginning of the reign of David. For the flood of Deucalion <a id="l2506"></a>happened in the reign of Cranaus.</p> 
<p id="par275">Of about the same age with Pelasgus, Inachus, Lelex, &amp; <a id="l2507"></a>Actæus was Ogyges. He reigned in Bœotia, &amp; some of his people <a id="l2508"></a>were Leleges; &amp; either he or his son Eleusis built the city Eleusis <a id="l2509"></a>in Attica, that is, they built a few houses of clay which in time grew <a id="l2510"></a>into a city. Acusilaus wrote that Phoroneus was older than Ogyges, &amp; that Ogyges flourished 1020 years before the first Olympiad, as <a id="l2511"></a>above. But Acusilaus was an Argive &amp; feigned these things in <a id="l2512"></a>honour of his country. To call things Ogygian has been a phrase <a id="l2513"></a>among the ancient Greeks to signify that they are as old as the <a id="l2514"></a>first memory of things. And so high we have now carried up the <a id="l2515"></a>chronology of the Greeks. Inachus might be as old as Ogyges, <a id="l2516"></a>but Acusilaus &amp; his followers made them seven hundred years <a id="l2517"></a>older than the truth; &amp; Chronologers to make out this recconing <a id="l2518"></a>have lengthened the races of the Kings of Argus &amp; Sicyon, &amp; changed <a id="l2519"></a>several contemporary  princes of Argos into successive Kings, &amp; inserted <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p047r"> &lt;47r&gt; </span> many feigned Kings into the race of the Kings of Sicyon.</p>
<p id="par276">Inachus had several sons who reigned in several parts of <a id="l2520"></a>Peloponnesus &amp; there built towns, as Phoroneus who built Phoronicum <a id="l2521"></a>afterwards called Argos from Argus his grandson, Ægialeus who <a id="l2522"></a>built Ægialea afterwards called Sicyon from Sicyon the grandson <a id="l2523"></a>of Erechtheus, Phegeus who built Phegea afterwards called Psophis <a id="l2524"></a>from Psophis the daughter of Lycaon. And these were the oldest towns <a id="l2525"></a>in Peloponnesus. Then Sisyphus the son of Æolus &amp; grandson of Hellen <a id="l2526"></a>built Ephyra afterwards called Corinth; &amp; Aëthlius the son of Æolus <a id="l2527"></a>built Elis. And before them Cecrops built Cecropia the cittadel of <a id="l2528"></a>Athens, &amp; Lycaon built Lycosura recconed by some the oldest town in <a id="l2529"></a>Arcadia, &amp; his sons, who were at least four &amp; twenty in number <a id="l2530"></a>built each of them a town except the youngest called Oenotrus, who <a id="l2531"></a>grew up after his fathers death &amp; sailed into Italy with his people, <a id="l2532"></a>&amp; there set on foot the building of towns, &amp; became the Ianus of <a id="l2533"></a>the Latines. Phoroneus had also several children &amp; grand children who <a id="l2534"></a>reigned in several places &amp; built new towns, as Car, Spartus, Apis. <a id="l2535"></a>And Hæmon the son of Pelasgus reigned in Hæmonia afterwards called <a id="l2536"></a>Thessaly, &amp; built towns there. And this division &amp; subdivision has made <a id="l2537"></a>great confusion in the history of the first kingdoms of Peloponesus, <a id="l2538"></a>&amp; thereby given occasion to the vain glorious Greeks to make those <a id="l2539"></a>kingdoms much older than they really were. But by all the reccon<a id="l2540"></a>ings abovementioned, the first civilizing of the Greeks, &amp; teaching <a id="l2541"></a>them to dwell in houses &amp; towns, &amp; the oldest towns in Europe could <a id="l2542"></a>scarce be above two or three generations older than the coming of <a id="l2543"></a>Cadmus from Sidon into Greece, &amp; might most probably be occasioned <a id="l2544"></a>by the expulsion of the shepherds out of Egypt in the days of Eli <a id="l2545"></a>&amp; Samuel &amp; their flying into Greece in considerable numbers. But <a id="l2546"></a>its difficult to set right the genealogies &amp; chronology of the fabulous <a id="l2547"></a>ages of the Greeks, &amp; I leave these things to be further examined.</p> 
<p id="par277">Before the Phœnicians introduced the deifying of dead men, <a id="l2548"></a>the Greeks had a Council of Elders in every  town for the govern<a id="l2549"></a>ment thereof, &amp; a place where the elders &amp; people  worshipped<a id="l2550"></a>their God with sacrifices. And when many of those towns for their <a id="l2551"></a>common safety united under a common Council, they erected a <a id="l2552"></a>Prytaneum or Court in one of the towns where the Council and people <a id="l2553"></a>met at certain times to consult their common safety &amp; worship their <a id="l2554"></a>common God with sacrifices &amp; to buy &amp; sell. The towns where these <a id="l2555"></a>Councils met, the Greeks called δημοι, peoples or communities or <a id="l2556"></a>corporation towns: &amp; at length when many of these δημοι for their <a id="l2557"></a>common safety united by consent under one common council, they <a id="l2558"></a>erected a Prytaneum in one of the δημοι for the common Council &amp; <a id="l2559"></a>people to meet in, &amp; to consult &amp; worship in, &amp; feast, &amp; buy &amp; sell; &amp; <a id="l2560"></a>this δημος they walled about for its safety, &amp; called την πολιν the <a id="l2561"></a>city. And this I take to have been the original of villages, market <a id="l2562"></a>towns, cities, common Councils, Vestal Temples, feasts &amp; fairs in Europe. <a id="l2563"></a>The Prytaneum (πυρος ταμειον) was a court with a place of worship &amp; <a id="l2564"></a>a perpetual fire kept therein upon an altar for sacrificing. From the <a id="l2565"></a>word ‛Εστια fire came the name Vesta, which at length the people turned <a id="l2566"></a>into a Goddess, &amp; so became fire worshippers like the ancient Persians. And <a id="l2567"></a>when these Councils made war upon their neighbours, they had a general com<a id="l2568"></a>mander to lead their armies, &amp; he became their King.</p> 
<p id="par278">So Thucydides <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n215-ref">[215]</sup> tells us that under Cecrops &amp; the ancient kings untill <a id="l2569"></a>Theseus, Attica was always inhabited city by city, each having Magistrates <a id="l2570"></a>&amp; Prytanea. Neither did they consult the king when there was no fear of <a id="l2571"></a>danger, but each apart administred their own common wealth, &amp; had their <a id="l2572"></a>own Council. Yea some(as the Eleusinians with Eumolpus against Erech<a id="l2573"></a>theus did sometimes make warr. But when Theseus, a prudent <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p048r"> &lt;48r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">&amp; potent man obteined the kingdom, he took away the courts &amp; magis<a id="l2574"></a>trates of the other cities, &amp; made them all meet in one Council &amp; Pryta<a id="l2575"></a>neum at Athens</em>. Polemon as he is cited by <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n216-ref">[216]</sup> Strabo, tells us, that in this <a id="l2576"></a>body of Attica, there were 170 δημοι, one of which was Eleusis. And <a id="l2577"></a>Philochorus <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n217-ref">[217]</sup> relates that <em class="underline">when Attica was infested by sea &amp; land <a id="l2578"></a>by the Cares &amp; Bœoti, Cecrops the first of any man reduced the multitude</em> (that is the 170 towns) <em class="underline">into twelve cities, whose names were <a id="l2579"></a>Cecropia, Tetrapolis, Epacria, Decelia, Eleusis, Aphidna, Thoricus, <a id="l2580"></a>Brauron, Cytherus, Sphettus, Cephissia, &amp; Phalerus; &amp; that Theseus <a id="l2581"></a>contracted those twelve cities into one which was Athens</em>.</p> 
<p id="par279">The original of the Kingdome of the Argives was much after <a id="l2582"></a>the same manner. For Pausanias <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n218-ref">[218]</sup> tells us that Phoroneus the son of <a id="l2583"></a>Inachus was the first who gathered into one community the Argives <a id="l2584"></a>who till then were scattered &amp; lived every where apart: &amp; the place <a id="l2585"></a>where they were first assembled was called Phoronicum, the city of <a id="l2586"></a>Phoroneus. And Strabo <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n219-ref">[219]</sup> observes that Homer calls all the places which <a id="l2587"></a>he reccons up in Peloponesus, a few excepted, not cities but regions <a id="l2588"></a>because each of them consisted of a convention of many δημοι, free <a id="l2589"></a>towns out of which afterward noble cities were built &amp; frequented. <a id="l2590"></a>So the Argives composed  Mantinæa in Arcadia out of five towns, &amp; <a id="l2591"></a>Tegea out of nine. And out of so many  was Heræa built by <a id="l2592"></a>Cleombrotus or by Cleonymus. So also Ægium was built out of <a id="l2593"></a>seven or eight towns, Patræ out of seven, &amp; Dyme out of eight; <a id="l2594"></a>&amp; so Elis was erected by the conflux of many towns into one city.</p>
<p id="par280">Pausanias <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n220-ref">[220]</sup> tells us that the Arcadians accounted Pelasgus the <a id="l2595"></a>first man, &amp; that he was their first king &amp; taught the ignorant people <a id="l2596"></a>to build houses for defending themselves from heat &amp; cold &amp; rain, &amp; <a id="l2597"></a>to make them garments of skins, &amp; instead of hearbs &amp; roots which <a id="l2598"></a>were sometimes noxious to eat the acorns of the beach tree: &amp; <a id="l2599"></a>that his son Lycaon built the oldest city in all Greece. He tells us also <a id="l2600"></a>that in the days of Lelex <span class="ns">☉</span> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 49v &gt; </span><span class="ns">☉</span> the Spartans lived in villages apart. The Greeks therefore began to build <a id="l2601"></a>houses &amp; villages in the days of Pelasgus the father of Lycaon &amp; in the days <a id="l2602"></a>of Lelex the father of Myles —<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 48r resumes &gt; </span> the father of Myles, &amp; by consequence about <a id="l2603"></a>two or three generations before the flood of Deucalion &amp; the com<a id="l2604"></a>ing of Cadmus. Till then <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n221-ref">[221]</sup> they lived in  woods &amp; caves of <a id="l2605"></a>the earth. The first houses were of clay till the brothers <a id="l2606"></a>Euryalus &amp; Hyperbius taught them to harden the clay into bricks <a id="l2607"></a>&amp; to build therewith. In the days of Ogyges, Pelasgus, Æzeus, <a id="l2608"></a>Inachus &amp; Lelex they began to build houses &amp; villages of clay, <a id="l2609"></a>Doxius the son of Cælus teaching them to do it, &amp; in the days of <a id="l2610"></a>Lycaon, Phoroneus, Ægialeus, Phegeus, Eurolas, Myles, Polycaon <a id="l2611"></a>&amp; Cecrops &amp; their sons to assemble the villages into δημοι &amp; the <a id="l2612"></a>δημοι into cities.</p>
<p id="par281">When Oenotrus the son of Lycaon carried a colony into Italy, <a id="l2613"></a>he a<sup class="note" id="n222-ref">[222]</sup> found that country for the most part uninhabited; &amp; where it <a id="l2614"></a>was inhabited, peopled but thinly: &amp; seizing a part of it, he built <a id="l2615"></a>towns in the mountains little &amp; numerous as above. These towns <a id="l2616"></a>were without walls: but after this colony grew numerous, &amp; began <a id="l2617"></a>to want room, they expelled the Siculi &amp; compassed many cities with <a id="l2618"></a>walls &amp; became possest of all the territory between the two rivers Liris <a id="l2619"></a>&amp; Tybur. And it is to be understood that those cities had their Councils <a id="l2620"></a>&amp; Prytanea after the manner of the Greeks. For Dionysius <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n223-ref">[223]</sup> tells us that <a id="l2621"></a>the new Kingdom of Rome as Romulus left it, consisted of thirty Courts <a id="l2622"></a>or Councils in thirty towns each with the sacred fire kept in the Pritaneum <a id="l2623"></a>of the Court for the senators who met there to perform sacred rites after <a id="l2624"></a>the manner of the Greeks. But when Numa the successor of Romulus <a id="l2625"></a>reigned, he leaving the several fires in their own Courts instituted <a id="l2626"></a>one common to them all at Rome. Whence Rome was  not a compleat city before the <a id="l2627"></a>days of Numa.</p> 
<p id="par282">When navigation was so far improved that the Phenicians began <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p049r"> &lt;49r&gt; </span> to leave the sea shore &amp; sail through the Mediterranean by the <a id="l2628"></a>help of the starrs, it may be presumed that they began to discover <a id="l2629"></a>the islands of the Mediterranean &amp; for the sake of trafic to sail as far <a id="l2630"></a>as Greece. And this was not long before they carried away Io the daugh<a id="l2631"></a>ter of Inachus from Argos. The Cares first infested the Greek seas with <a id="l2632"></a>piracy. And then Minos the son of Europa got up a potent fleet, &amp; sent out colonies. For Diodorus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n224-ref">[224]</sup> tells us that the <em class="underline">Cyclade</em> Islands (those <a id="l2633"></a>neare Crete) wer<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e at<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> first desolate &amp; uninhabited: but Minos having <a id="l2634"></a>a potent fleet sent many colonies out of Crete &amp; peopled many of them. <a id="l2635"></a>And particularly that the Island <em class="underline">Carpathus</em> was first seized by the sol<a id="l2636"></a>diers of Minos. <em class="underline">Syme</em> lay wast &amp; desolate till Triops came thither with <a id="l2637"></a>a colony under Chthonius <em class="underline">Strongyle</em> or <em class="underline">Naxus</em> was first inhabited by <a id="l2638"></a>the Thracians in the days of Boreas a little before the Argonautic <a id="l2639"></a>Expedition. <em class="underline">Samus</em> was at first desert &amp; inhabited only by a great <a id="l2640"></a>multitude of terrible wild beasts till Macarius peopled it, as he did also <a id="l2641"></a>the islands <em class="underline">Chius</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Coos</em>. <em class="underline">Lesbos</em> lay waste &amp; desolate till Xanthus <a id="l2642"></a>sailed thither with a colony. <em class="underline">Tenedos</em> lay desolate till Tennes a little <a id="l2643"></a>before the Trojan war, sailed thither from Troas. Aristæus who mar<a id="l2644"></a>ried Autonoe the daughter of Cadmus, carried a colony from Thebes <a id="l2645"></a>into <em class="underline">Cæa</em> an island not inhabited before. The island <em class="underline">Rhodes</em> was <a id="l2646"></a>at first called <em class="underline">Ophiusa</em> being full of serpents before Phorbas, a Prince of <a id="l2647"></a>Argos, went thither &amp; made it habitable by destroying the serpents, which was about <a id="l2648"></a>the end of Solomon's reign : in memory of which he is delineated in the heavens <a id="l2649"></a>in the constellation of Ophiuchus. The discovery of this &amp; some other islands <a id="l2650"></a>made a report that they rose out of the sea. <em class="underline">In Asia Delos emersit et <a id="l2651"></a>Hiera &amp; Anaphe &amp; Rhodus</em> saith <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n225-ref">[225]</sup> Ammian.

<p id="par283">Diodorus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n227-ref">[227]</sup> tells us also that the seven islands called Æolides between <a id="l2654"></a>Italy &amp; Sicily were desert &amp; uninhabited till Lipparus &amp; Æolus, a little <a id="l2655"></a>before the Trojan war, went thither from Italy &amp; peopled them. And <a id="l2656"></a>that Malta &amp; Gaulus or Gaudus on the other side of Sicily, were first peopled <a id="l2657"></a>by Phœnicians; &amp; so was Madera without the straits. And Homer writes <a id="l2658"></a>that Vlysses found the island Ogygia covered with wood &amp; uninhabited <a id="l2659"></a>except by Calypso &amp; her maids who lived in a cave without houses. And it <a id="l2660"></a>is not likely that great Britain &amp; Ireland could be peopled before naviga<a id="l2661"></a>tion was propagated beyond the straits.</p> 
<p id="par284">The Sicaneans were reputed the first inhabitants of Sicily. They <a id="l2662"></a>built little villages or towns upon hills, &amp; every town had its own king. <a id="l2663"></a>And by this means they spread over the country before they formed <a id="l2664"></a>themselves into larger governments with a common King. Philistus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n228-ref">[228]</sup> <a id="l2665"></a>saith that they were transplanted into  Sicily from <a id="l2666"></a>the river Sicanus in Spain, &amp; Dionysius <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n229-ref">[229]</sup> that they were a Spa<a id="l2667"></a>nish people who fled from the Ligures in Italy.

And these several colonies spake <a id="l2684"></a>several languages, &amp; fed on the spontaeous fruits of the earth, &amp; lived quietly <a id="l2685"></a>in caves &amp; huts till the invention of iron tools in the days of Asterius the son of <a id="l2686"></a>Teutamus; &amp; at length were reduced into one kingdom &amp; one people by Minos, <a id="l2687"></a>who was their first lawgiver, &amp; built many towns &amp; ships, &amp; introduced plowing <a id="l2688"></a>&amp; sowing, &amp; in whose days the Curetes conquered his fathers friends in Crete <a id="l2689"></a>&amp; Peloponesus. The Curetes <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n235-ref">[235]</sup> sacrificed children to Saturn, &amp; according to <a id="l2690"></a>Bochart <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n236-ref">[236]</sup> were Philistims. And Eusebius saith that Crete had its name from <a id="l2691"></a>Cres one of the Curetes who nursed up Iupiter. But what ever was the origi<a id="l2692"></a>nal of the Island, it seems to have been peopled by colonies which spake differ<a id="l2693"></a>ent languages till the days of Asterius &amp; Minos, &amp; might come thither two <a id="l2694"></a>or three generations before, &amp; not above for want of navigation in those seas.</p> 
<p id="par286">And the island Cyprus was discovered by the Phenicians not long before. For Eratosthenes <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n237-ref">[237]</sup> tells us that Cyprus was at first so overgrown with wood that <a id="l2695"></a>it could not be tilled, &amp; that they first cut down the wood for the melting <a id="l2696"></a>of copper &amp; silver, &amp; afterwards when they began to sail safely upon the <a id="l2697"></a>mediterranean, (that is, presently after the Trojan war) they built ships &amp; even <a id="l2698"></a>navies of it. And when they could not thus destroy the wood, they gave every man <a id="l2699"></a>leave to cut down what wood he pleased, &amp; to possess all the ground which he <a id="l2700"></a>cleared of wood. So also Europe at first abounded very much with woods, one <a id="l2701"></a>of which called the Hercinian, took up a great part of Germany, being full <a id="l2702"></a>nine days journey broad &amp; above forty long in Iulius Cæsar's days. And yet <a id="l2703"></a>the Europeans had been cutting down their woods to make room for mankind <a id="l2704"></a>ever since the invention of iron tools in the days of Asterius &amp; Minos.</p> 
<p id="par287">All these footsteps there are of the first peopling of Europe &amp; its islands <a id="l2705"></a>by sea. Before those days it seems to have been thinly peopled  from the <a id="l2706"></a>northern coast of the Euxine sea by Scythians descended from Iaphet, who <a id="l2707"></a>wandered without houses &amp; sheltered themselves from rain &amp; wild beasts in thickets <a id="l2708"></a>&amp; caves of the earth, such as were the caves in mount Ida in Crete in which <a id="l2709"></a>Minos was educated &amp; buried; the cave of Cacus, &amp; the Catacombs in Italy near <a id="l2710"></a>Rome &amp; Naples, afterwards turned into burying places; the Syringes &amp; many <a id="l2711"></a>other caves in the sides of the mountains of Egypt; the caves of the Troglo<a id="l2712"></a>dytes between Egypt &amp; the red Sea; &amp; those of the Phaurusij in Afric mentioned <a id="l2713"></a>by <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n238-ref">[238]</sup> Strabo; &amp; the caves &amp; thickets &amp; rocks &amp; high places &amp; pits in which the <a id="l2714"></a>Israelites hid them selves from the Philistims in the days of Saul, 1 Sam.xiii.6. <a id="l2715"></a>But of the state of mankind in Europe in those days there is now no history <a id="l2716"></a>remaining.</p> 
<p id="par288">The antiquities of Libya were not much older than those of Europe. For <a id="l2717"></a>Diodorus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n239-ref">[239]</sup> tells us that Vranus the father of Hyperion &amp; grandfather of Helius &amp; <a id="l2718"></a>Selene, (that is Ammon the father of Sesac) was their first common King, &amp; caused the <a id="l2719"></a>people who till then wandered up &amp; down, to dwell in towns.  And Hero<a id="l2722"></a>dotus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n240-ref">[240]</sup> tells us that all Media was peopled by δημοι towns without walls <a id="l2723"></a>till they revolted from the Assyrians, which was about 267 years after the <a id="l2724"></a>death of Solomon: &amp; that after that revolt they set up a King over them &amp; built <a id="l2725"></a>Ecbatane with walls for his seat, the first town which they walled about. And <a id="l2726"></a>about 72 years after the death of Solomon, Benhadad King of Syria <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n241-ref">[241]</sup> had two <a id="l2727"></a>&amp; thirty kings in his army against Ahab. And when Ioshuah conquered <a id="l2728"></a>the land of Canaan, every city of the Canaanites had its own king like the cities <a id="l2729"></a>of Europe before they conquered one another: &amp; one of those kings (Adonibezek <a id="l2730"></a>king of Bezek) had conquered seventy other kings a little before, Iudg.1. 7. &amp; <a id="l2731"></a>therefore towns began to be built in that land not many ages before the days of <a id="l2732"></a>Ioshuah. For the patriarchs wandred there in tents, &amp; fed their flocks wherever <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p051r"> &lt;51r&gt; </span> they pleased, the fields of Phenicia not being yet fully appropriated for want <a id="l2733"></a>of people. The countries first inhabited by mankind, were in those days so <a id="l2734"></a>thinly peopled that four kings from the coasts of Shinar &amp; Elam invaded &amp; <a id="l2735"></a>spoiled the Rephaims &amp; the inhabitants of the countries of Moab, Ammon, <a id="l2736"></a>Edom, &amp; the Kingdoms of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah &amp; Zeboim, &amp; yet were <a id="l2737"></a>pursued &amp; beaten by Abraham with  an armed force of only 318 men, the <a id="l2738"></a>whole force which Abraham &amp; the princes with him could raise. And Æ<a id="l2739"></a>gypt was so thinly peopled before the birth of Moses, that Pharaoh said <a id="l2740"></a>of the Israelites : <em class="underline">Behold the people of the children of Israel are more <a id="l2741"></a>&amp; mightier than we</em> : And to prevent their multiplying &amp; growing too <a id="l2742"></a>strong he caused their male children to be drowned.</p> 
<p id="par289">These footsteps there are of the first peopling of the earth by <a id="l2743"></a>mankind not long before the days of Abraham, &amp; of the overspreading it <a id="l2744"></a>with villages towns &amp; cities, &amp; their growing into Kingdoms <a id="l2745"></a>first smaller &amp; then greater untill the rise of the monarchies of Egypt, <a id="l2746"></a>Assyria, Babylon, Media, Persia, Greece, &amp; Rome, the first great Empires <a id="l2747"></a>on this side India. Abraham was the fift from Peleg, &amp; all mankind lived <a id="l2748"></a>together in Chaldea under the government of Noah &amp; his sons untill the <a id="l2749"></a>days of Peleg. So long they were of one language, one society &amp; one religion. <a id="l2750"></a>And then they divided the earth, being perhaps disturbed by the rebellion of Nim<a id="l2751"></a>rod, &amp; forced to leave off building the tower of Babel. And from thence they <a id="l2752"></a>spread themselves into the  several countries which fell to their shares, <a id="l2753"></a>carrying along with them the laws customes &amp; religion under which they <a id="l2754"></a>had till those days been educated &amp; governed by Noah &amp; his sons &amp; grand<a id="l2755"></a>sons. And these laws were handed down to Abraham Melchizedec &amp; <a id="l2756"></a>Iob &amp; their contemporaries, &amp; for sometime were observed by the Iudges <a id="l2757"></a>of the eastern countries. So Iob <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n242-ref">[242]</sup> tells us that adultery was an heinous crime <a id="l2758"></a><em class="underline">yea an iniquity to be punished by the judges</em>. And of idolatry he <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n243-ref">[243]</sup> saith, <a id="l2759"></a><em class="underline">If I beheld the sun when it shined or the Moon walking in brightness, &amp; <a id="l2760"></a>my heart hath been secretly inticed or my mouth hath kissed my hand, this <a id="l2761"></a>also were an iniquity to bee punished by the judges : for I should have denyed my God</em>. And there being no dispute between Iob &amp; his friends about these <a id="l2762"></a>matters: it may be presumed that they also with their countrymen were of <a id="l2763"></a>the same religion. Melchizedek was a priest of the most high God, &amp; A<a id="l2764"></a>braham voluntarily paid tyths to him : which he would scarce have done <a id="l2765"></a>had they not been of one &amp; the same religion. The first inhabitants of <a id="l2766"></a>the land of Canaan seem also to have been originally of the same religion <a id="l2767"></a>&amp; to have continued in it till the death of Noah &amp; the days of Abraham. <a id="l2768"></a>For Ierusalem was anciently <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n244-ref">[244]</sup> called Iebus &amp; its people Iebusites, &amp; Mel<a id="l2769"></a>chizedek was their Priest &amp; King. These nations revolted therefore <a id="l2770"></a>after the days of Melchizedek to the worship of fals Gods; as did also <a id="l2771"></a>the posterity of Ismael, Esau, Moab, Ammon, &amp; that of Abraham by <a id="l2772"></a>Keturah. And the Israelites themselves were very apt to revolt. And one <a id="l2773"></a>reason why Terah went from Vr of the Chaldees to Haran in his way to <a id="l2774"></a>the land of Canaan, &amp; why Abraham afterward left Haran &amp; went <a id="l2775"></a>into the land of Canaan, might be to avoyd the worship of false Gods which <a id="l2776"></a> in their days began in Chaldea &amp; spread every way from thence <a id="l2777"></a>but did not yet reach into the land of Canaan. Several of the laws <a id="l2778"></a>&amp; precepts in which this primitive religion consisted are mentioned in <a id="l2779"></a>the book of Iob, chap. 1. v. 5, &amp; chap. XXX1, viz not to blaspheme God, nor to <a id="l2780"></a>worship the sun or Moon, nor to kill, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor <a id="l2781"></a>trust in riches, nor oppress the poor or fatherless, nor curse your enemies, nor <a id="l2782"></a>rejoyce at their misfortunes: but to be friendly &amp; hospitable &amp; mercifull, &amp; <a id="l2783"></a>to relieve the poor &amp;  needy, &amp; to set up judges. This was the morality <a id="l2784"></a>&amp; religion of the first ages still called by the Iews, The precepts of the sons <a id="l2785"></a>of Noah. This was the religion of Moses &amp; the prophets comprehended in the <a id="l2786"></a>two great commandments of loving the Lord our God with all our heart &amp; soul <a id="l2787"></a>&amp; mind, &amp; our neighbour as our selves. This was the religion enjoyned <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p052r"> &lt;52r&gt; </span> by Moses to the uncircumcised stranger within the gates of Israel as <a id="l2788"></a>well as to the Israelites. And this is the primitive religion of both <a id="l2789"></a>Iews &amp; Christians &amp; ought to be the standing religion of all nations, <a id="l2790"></a>it being for the honour of God &amp; good of mankind. And Moses adds the precept of being <a id="l2791"></a>merciful even to bruit beasts, so as not to suck out their blood, nor to <a id="l2792"></a>cut off their flesh alive with the blood in it, nor to kill them for the <a id="l2793"></a>sake of their blood, nor to strangle them : but in killing them for food, <a id="l2794"></a>to let out their blood &amp; spill it upon the ground Gen. IX. 6, &amp; Levit. XVII. 12,13. <a id="l2795"></a>This law was ancienter than the days of Moses, being given to Noah &amp; <a id="l2796"></a>his sons long before the days of Abraham. And therefore when the <a id="l2797"></a>Apostles &amp; Elders in the Council at Ierusalem declared that the gentiles <a id="l2798"></a>were not obliged to be circumcised &amp; keep the law of Moses, they ex<a id="l2799"></a>cepted this law of abstaining from blood &amp; things stranguled as <a id="l2800"></a>being an earlier law of God imposed not on the sons of Abraham <a id="l2801"></a>only but on all nations while they lived together in Shinar under <a id="l2802"></a>the dominion of Noah. And of the same kind is the law of abstaining <a id="l2803"></a>from meats offered to idols or fals Gods, &amp; from fornication. So then <a id="l2804"></a>the believing that the world was framed by one supreme God, &amp; is go<a id="l2805"></a>verned by him, &amp; of loving &amp; worshipping him, &amp; honouring our parents, &amp; loving our neigh<a id="l2806"></a>bour as our selves, &amp; being merciful even to bruit beasts, is the <a id="l2807"></a>oldest of all religions. And the originall of letters, agriculture, na<a id="l2808"></a>vigation, music, arts &amp; sciences, metalls, smiths &amp; carpenters, towns <a id="l2809"></a>&amp; houses  was not older in Europe than the days of Eli, <a id="l2810"></a>Samuel &amp; David. And before those days the earth was so thinly <a id="l2811"></a>peopled &amp; so overgrown with woods, that mankind could not be much <a id="l2812"></a>older than is represented in scripture.</p>

<h2 id="hd6" class="cent">Chap. II. <a id="l2813"></a><br>Of the Empire of Egypt.</h2>
<p id="par290">The Egyptians anciently boasted of a very great &amp; lasting <a id="l2814"></a>Empire under their Kings Ammon, Osiris, Bacchus, Sesostris, Hercules, <a id="l2815"></a>Memnon &amp;c. reaching eastward to the Indies &amp; westward to the Atlantic <a id="l2816"></a>Ocean; &amp; out of vanity have made this monarchy some thousands of <a id="l2817"></a>years older than the world. Let us now try to rectify the chrono<a id="l2818"></a>logy of Egypt by comparing the affairs of Egypt with the synchronizing <a id="l2819"></a>affairs of the Greeks &amp;  Hebrews.</p>
<p id="par291">Bacchus the conqueror loved two weomen, Venus &amp; Ariadne. <a id="l2820"></a>Venus was the mistress of Anchises &amp; Cinyras &amp; mother of Æneas <a id="l2821"></a>who all lived till the destruction of Troy; &amp; the sons of Bacchus &amp; <a id="l2822"></a>Ariadne were Argonauts as above: And therefore the great Bacchus <a id="l2823"></a>flourished but one generation before the Argonautic expedition. This <a id="l2824"></a>Bacchus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n245-ref">[245]</sup> was potent at sea, conquered eastward as far as India, <a id="l2825"></a>returned in triumph, brought his army over the Hellespont, conquered Thrace, left mu<a id="l2826"></a>sic, dancing &amp; poetry there, killed Lycurgus King of Thrace &amp; Pentheus <a id="l2827"></a>the grandson of Cadmus, gave the Kingdom of Lycurgus to Tharops, <a id="l2828"></a>&amp; one of his minstrells  called by the Greeks Calliope to Oeagrus <a id="l2829"></a>the son of Tharops, &amp; of Oeagrus &amp; Calliope was born Orpheus <a id="l2830"></a>who sailed with the Argonauts. This Bacchus was therefore <a id="l2831"></a>contemporary to Sesostris. And both being kings of Egypt &amp; potent <a id="l2832"></a>at sea, &amp; great conquerors, &amp; carrying on their conquests into <a id="l2833"></a>India &amp; Thrace, they must be one &amp; the same man.</p>
<p id="par292">The ancient Greeks who made the fables of the Gods, related <a id="l2834"></a>that Io the daughter of Inachus was carried into Ægypt &amp; there <a id="l2835"></a>became the Egyptian Isis, &amp; that Apis the son of Phoroneus after <a id="l2836"></a>death became the God Serapis; &amp; some said that Epaphus was the <a id="l2837"></a>son of Io. Serapis &amp; Epaphus are Osiris, &amp; therefore Isis &amp; Osiris <a id="l2838"></a>in the opinion of the ancient Greeks who made the fables of the <a id="l2839"></a>Gods were not above two or three generations older than the Argo<a id="l2840"></a>nautic expedition. Dicæarchus, as he is cited by the scholiast upon <a id="l2841"></a>Apollonius, <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n246-ref">[246]</sup> represents them two generations older than Sesostris, <a id="l2842"></a>saying that after Orus the son of Osiris &amp; Isis, reigned Sesonchosis. <a id="l2843"></a>He seems to have followed the opinion of the people of Naxus who <a id="l2844"></a>made Bacchus two generations older than Theseus, &amp; for that end <a id="l2845"></a>feigned two Minoses &amp; two Ariadnes. For by the consent of all an<a id="l2846"></a>tiquity Osiris &amp; Bacchus were one &amp; the same king of Egypt. This is <a id="l2847"></a>affirmed by the Egyptians as well as by the Greeks. And some of <a id="l2848"></a>the ancient mythologists, as Eumolpus &amp; Orpheus, <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n247-ref">[247]</sup> called Osiris by <a id="l2849"></a>the names of Dionysus &amp; Sirius. Osiris was King of all Egypt, &amp; <a id="l2850"></a>a great conqueror &amp; came over the Hellespont in the days of <a id="l2851"></a>Triptolemus &amp; subdued Thrace &amp; there killed Lycurgus, &amp; therefore <a id="l2852"></a>his expedition falls in with that of the great Bacchus. Osiris, Bacchus &amp; Sesostris lived about the same time, &amp; by the relation of historians <a id="l2853"></a>were all of them Kings of all Egypt, &amp; reigned at Thebes &amp; adorned <a id="l2854"></a>that city &amp; were very potent by land &amp; sea. All three were great <a id="l2855"></a>conquerors &amp; carried on their conquests by land through Asia as far <a id="l2856"></a>as India. All three came over the Hellespont &amp; were there in danger of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p054r"> &lt;54r&gt; </span> losing their army. All three conquered Thrace &amp; there put a stop <a id="l2857"></a>to their victories &amp; returned back from thence into Egypt. All three <a id="l2858"></a>left pillars with inscriptions in their conquests. And therefore all three must be one &amp; the same King of Egypt; &amp; this King can be no <a id="l2859"></a>other than Sesac. All Egypt including Thebais Æthiopia &amp; Libya, had <a id="l2860"></a>no common King before the expulsion of the shepherds who reigned in <a id="l2861"></a>the lower Egypt, no Conqueror of Syria India Asia minor &amp; Thrace <a id="l2862"></a>before Sesac. The sacred history admits of no Egyptian conqueror <a id="l2863"></a>of Palestine before this King.</p>
<p id="par293">Thymetes <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n248-ref">[248]</sup> who was contemporary to Orpheus, &amp; wrote a Poesy <a id="l2864"></a>called Phrygia of the actions of Bacchus in very old language &amp; character <a id="l2865"></a>said that Bacchus had Libyan weomen in his army amongst whom was <a id="l2866"></a>Minerva a woman born in Libya neare the river Triton, &amp; that Bacchus <a id="l2867"></a>commanded the men &amp; Minerva the weomen. Diodorus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n249-ref">[249]</sup> calls her Myrina, &amp; saith that she was Queen of the Amazons in Libya &amp; there conquered <a id="l2868"></a>the Atlantides &amp; Gorgons, &amp; then made a league with Orus the son of <a id="l2869"></a>Isis [sent to her by his father Osiris or Bacchus for that purpose] &amp; passing <a id="l2870"></a>through Egypt subdued the Arabians &amp; Syria &amp; Cilicia, &amp; came through <a id="l2871"></a>Phrygia, [viz<sup>t</sup> in the army of Bacchus] to the Mediterranean, but passing <a id="l2872"></a>over into Europe was slain with many of her weomen by the Thracians <a id="l2873"></a>&amp; Scythians under the conduct of Sipylus a Scythian &amp; Mompsus a Thracian <a id="l2874"></a>whom Lycurgus king of Thrace had banished. This was that Lycurgus <a id="l2875"></a>who opposed the passage of Bacchus over the Hellespont, &amp; was soon after <a id="l2876"></a>conquered by him &amp; slain. But afterwards Bacchus met with a repulse <a id="l2877"></a>from the Greeks under the conduct of Perseus who slew many of his <a id="l2878"></a>weomen as Pausanias <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n250-ref">[250]</sup> relates, &amp; was assisted by the Scythians &amp; Thracians <a id="l2879"></a>under the conduct of Sipulus &amp; Mompsus; which repulses together with <a id="l2880"></a>a revolt of his brother Danaus in Egypt, put a stop to his victories. And <a id="l2881"></a>in returning home he left part of his men in Colchos  &amp; mount Cau<a id="l2882"></a>casus under Æetes &amp; Prometheus, &amp; his weomen upon the river Thermodon <a id="l2883"></a>neare Colchos under their new Queens Marthesia &amp; Lampeto. For Dio<a id="l2884"></a>nysius <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n251-ref">[251]</sup> speaking of the Amazons who were seated at Thermoodon, <a id="l2885"></a>saith that they dwelt originally in Libya, &amp; there reigned over the <a id="l2886"></a>Atlantides, &amp; invading their neighbours conquered as far as Europe. <a id="l2887"></a>And Ammianus <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n252-ref">[252]</sup> that the ancient Amazons breaking through many <a id="l2888"></a>nations, attackt the Athenians, &amp; there receiving a great slaughter re<a id="l2889"></a>tired to Thermodon. And Iustin <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n253-ref">[253]</sup> that these Amazons  had at first [he means, at their first coming to Thermodon] <a id="l2891"></a>two queens who called themselves daughters of Mars, &amp; that they <a id="l2892"></a>conquered part of Europe &amp; some cities of Asia [videlicet in the reign of <a id="l2893"></a>Minerva] &amp; then sent back part of their army with a great booty <a id="l2894"></a>[under their said new Queens,] &amp; that Marthesia being afterwards <a id="l2895"></a>slain was succeeded by her daughter Orithya &amp; she by Penthesilea; <a id="l2896"></a>&amp; that Theseus captivated &amp; married Antiopa the sister of Orithya. <a id="l2897"></a>Hercules made war upon the Amazons, &amp; in the reign of Orithya <a id="l2898"></a>&amp;  Penthesilea they came to the Trojan war. Whence the <a id="l2899"></a>first wars of the Amazons in Europe &amp; Asia &amp; their settling at <a id="l2900"></a>Thermodon were but one generation before those actions of Hercules <a id="l2901"></a>&amp; Theseus, &amp; but two before the Trojan war, &amp; so fell in with the <a id="l2902"></a>expedition of Sesostris. And since they warred in the days of Isis <a id="l2903"></a>&amp; her son Orus, &amp; were a part of the army of Bacchus or Osiris, <a id="l2904"></a>we have here a further argument for making Osiris &amp; Bacchus <a id="l2905"></a>contemporary to Sesostris, &amp; all three one &amp; the same king with <a id="l2906"></a>Sesac.</p>
<p id="par294">The Greeks reccon Osiris &amp; Bacchus to be sons of Iupiter, &amp; the <a id="l2907"></a>Egyptian name of Iupiter is Ammon. Manetho in his 11<sup>th</sup> &amp; 12<sup>th</sup> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p055r"> &lt;55r&gt; </span> Dynasties as he is cited by Africanus &amp; Eusebius, names these four Kings <a id="l2908"></a>of Egypt as reigning in order: Ammenemes, Gesongeses or Sesonchoris the <a id="l2909"></a>son of Ammenemes, Ammenemes who was slain by his Eunuchs, &amp; Sesostris <a id="l2910"></a>who subdued all Asia &amp; part of Europe.

<p id="par297">The lower part of Egypt being yearly overflowed by the Nile, was scarce <a id="l2931"></a>inhabited before the invention of corn which made it useful. And the king who by this <a id="l2932"></a>invention first peopled it &amp; reigned over it (perhaps the king of the city Mesir <a id="l2933"></a>where Memphis was afterwards built) seems to have been worshipped in the Ox <a id="l2934"></a>or calf after death by his subjects for this benefaction. For this city stood in the <a id="l2935"></a>most convenient place to people the lower Egypt, &amp; from its being composed <a id="l2936"></a>of two parts seated on each side of the river Nile might give the name of <a id="l2937"></a>Mizraim to its founder &amp; people unless you had rather refer the word to the double people, those above the Delta &amp; those within it. And this I take to be the state of the lower <a id="l2938"></a>Egypt till the shepherds or Phenicians who fled from Ioshuah, conquered <a id="l2939"></a>it, &amp; being afterwards conquered by the Ethiopians, &amp; fled into Afric &amp; other <a id="l2940"></a>places. For there <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n260-ref">[260]</sup> was a tradition that some of them fled into Afric. And S<sup>t</sup> <a id="l2941"></a>Austin <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n261-ref">[261]</sup> confirms this by telling us that the common people of Afric being asked <a id="l2942"></a>who they were, replied Chanani, that is, Canaanites. <em class="underline">Interrogati rustici nostri,</em> <a id="l2943"></a>saith he, <em class="underline">quid sint, Punice respondentes Chanani, corrupta scilicet voce <a id="l2944"></a>sicut in talibus solet, quid aliud respondent quam Chanaanæi</em>?

By the language &amp; <a id="l2964"></a>extreme poverty of the Mores (described also by Procopius) &amp; by their being <a id="l2965"></a>unacquainted with merchandise &amp; sea affairs, you may know that they were <a id="l2966"></a>Canaanites originally, &amp; peopled Afric before the Tyrian merchants came <a id="l2967"></a>thither. These Canaanites coming from the east, pitched their tents in <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p056r"> &lt;56r&gt; </span> great numbers in the lower Egypt in the reign of Timaus (as <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n265-ref">[265]</sup> Manetho <a id="l2968"></a>writes,) &amp; easily seized the country, &amp; fortifying Pelusium then called Abaris, <a id="l2969"></a>they erected a kingdom there &amp; reigned long under their own kings, Salatis, <a id="l2970"></a>Bæon, Apagnas, Apophis, Ianias, Assis, &amp; others successively. And in the mean <a id="l2971"></a>time the upper part of Ægypt called Thebais &amp; (according to <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n266-ref">[266]</sup> Herodotus) Ægyp<a id="l2972"></a>tus, &amp; in scripture the land of Pathros, was under other kings, reigning <a id="l2973"></a>perhaps at Coptos &amp; Thebes &amp; This &amp; Syene &amp; Pathros &amp; Elephantis &amp; Heracleo<a id="l2974"></a>polis &amp; Mesir &amp; other great cities till they conquered one another or were <a id="l2975"></a>conquered by the Ethiopians. For cities grew great in those days by being the <a id="l2976"></a>seats of kingdoms. But at length one of these Kingdoms conquered the <a id="l2977"></a>rest &amp; made a lasting war upon the shepherds &amp; in the reign of its King <a id="l2978"></a>Misphragmuthosis &amp; his son Amosis  called also Thmosis Thomosis &amp; Tuthmosis) drove them out of <a id="l2979"></a>Egypt, &amp; made them fly into Afric &amp; Syria &amp; other places, &amp; united all Egypt <a id="l2980"></a>into one monarchy, &amp; under their next kings Ammon &amp; Sesac enlarged it into <a id="l2981"></a>a great Empire. This conquering people worshipped not the kings of the <a id="l2982"></a>shepherds whom they conquered, &amp; expelled, but <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n267-ref">[267]</sup> abolished their religion of <a id="l2983"></a>sacrificing men &amp; after the manner of those ages deifyed their own kings <a id="l2984"></a>who founded their new dominion, beginning the history of their empire <a id="l2985"></a>with the reign &amp; great acts of their Gods &amp; Heroes. Whence their Gods Am<a id="l2986"></a>mon &amp; Rhea (or Vranus &amp; Titæa) Osiris &amp; Isis, Orus &amp; Bubaste, &amp; their <a id="l2987"></a>secretary Thoth, &amp; Generals Hercules &amp; Pan, &amp; Admiral Iapetus, Neptune <a id="l2988"></a>or Typhon were all of them Thebans, &amp; flourished after the expulsion <a id="l2989"></a>of the Shepherds. Homer places Thebes in Ethiopia, &amp; the Ethiopians reported <a id="l2990"></a>that <sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n268-ref">[268]</sup> the Egyptians were a colony drawn out of them by Osiris, &amp; that thence <a id="l2991"></a>it came to pass that most of the laws of Egypt were the same with those of <a id="l2992"></a>Ethiopia, &amp; that the Egyptians learnt from the Ethiopians the custome of <a id="l2993"></a>deifying their Kings.</p>
<p id="par298">When Ioseph entertained his brethren in Egypt, they did eat at a table by <a id="l2994"></a>themselves, &amp; he did eat at another table by himself, &amp; the Egyptians who did <a id="l2995"></a>eat with him were at another table, because the Egyptians might not eat bread <a id="l2996"></a>with the Hebrews. For that was an abomination to the Egyptians, Gen. XLC111.32. <a id="l2997"></a>These Egyptians who did eat with Ioseph were of the court of Pharaoh: &amp; <a id="l2998"></a>therefore Pharaoh &amp; his court were at this time not shepherds but genuine <a id="l2999"></a>Egyptians. And these Egyptians abominated eating bread with the Hebrews <a id="l3000"></a>at one &amp; the same table. And of these Egyptians &amp; their fellow subjects <a id="l3001"></a>it is said a little after that <em class="underline">every Shepherd is an abomination to the Egyp<a id="l3002"></a>tians</em>. Ægypt at this time was therefore under the government of the <a id="l3003"></a>genuine Egyptians &amp; not under that of the shepherds.</p>
<p id="par299">After the descent of Iacob &amp; his sons into Ægypt, Ioseph lived 70 years, &amp; so long continued in favour with the Kings of Egypt. And 64 years <a id="l3004"></a>after his death Moses was born. And between the death of Ioseph &amp; the <a id="l3005"></a>birth of Moses there rose up another king who knew not Ioseph (Exod. 1.<a id="l3006"></a>8.) But this king of Egypt was not one of the shepherds. For he is called <a id="l3007"></a>Pharaoh (Exod. 1. 11, 22.) &amp; Moses told his successor that if the people of <a id="l3008"></a>Israel should sacrifice in the land of Egypt, they should sacrifice <a id="l3009"></a>the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes &amp; the Egyptians would <a id="l3010"></a>stone them (Exod. V111. 26,) that is they should sacrifice sheep or oxen <a id="l3011"></a>contrary to the religion of Egypt. The Shepherds therefore did not reign <a id="l3012"></a>over Egypt while Israel was there, but either were driven out of <a id="l3013"></a>Egypt before Israel went down thither, or did not enter into Egypt <a id="l3014"></a>till after Moses had brought Israel from thence. And the latter must be <a id="l3015"></a>true if they were driven out of Egypt a little before the building of the <a id="l3016"></a>temple of Solomon as Manetho affirms.</p>
<p id="par300">Diodorus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n269-ref">[269]</sup> saith in his 40<sup>th</sup> book that in Egypt there were formerly <a id="l3017"></a>multitudes of strangers of several nations who used foreign rites &amp; cere<a id="l3018"></a>monies in worshipping the Gods, for which they were expelled Egypt, &amp; under <a id="l3019"></a>Danaus Cadmus &amp; other skilful commanders after great hardships came <a id="l3020"></a>into Greece &amp; other places; but the greatest part of them came into <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p057r"> &lt;57r&gt; </span> Iudea not far from Egypt, a country then uninhabited &amp; desert, being <a id="l3021"></a>conducted thither by one Moses, a wise &amp; valiant man, who after he <a id="l3022"></a>had possest himself of the country, among other things built Ierusalem <a id="l3023"></a>&amp; the  Temple. Diodorus here mistakes the original of the Israelites <a id="l3024"></a>as Manetho had done before, confounding their flight into the wilderness <a id="l3025"></a>under the conduct of Moses, with the flight of the shepherds from Mis<a id="l3026"></a>phragmuthosis &amp; his son Amosis into Phœnicia &amp; Afric, &amp; not knowing that <a id="l3027"></a>Iudea was inhabited by Canaanites before the Israelites under Moses came <a id="l3028"></a>thither. But however, he lets us know that the shepherds were expelled <a id="l3029"></a>Egypt by Amosis a little before the building of Ierusalem &amp; the Temple, <a id="l3030"></a>&amp; that after several hardships several of them came into Greece &amp; other <a id="l3031"></a>places under the conduct of Cadmus &amp; other captains, but the most of <a id="l3032"></a>them settled in Phenicia next Egypt. We may reccon therefore that the <a id="l3033"></a>expulsion of the shepherds by the kings of Thebais was the occasion <a id="l3034"></a>that the Philistims were so numerous in the days of Saul, &amp; that so <a id="l3035"></a>many men came in those times with colonies out of Egypt  &amp; Phœnicia <a id="l3036"></a>into Greece, as  Lelex, Inachus, Pelasgus, Æzeus, Cecrops, Ægialeus, <a id="l3037"></a>Cadmus, Phineus, Membliarius, Alymnus, Abas, Erechtheus, Peteos, Phorbas <a id="l3038"></a>in the days of Eli, Samuel, Saul &amp; David. Some of them fled in the days of <a id="l3039"></a>Eli, from Misphragmuthosis who conquered part of the lower Egypt; others <a id="l3040"></a>retired from his successor Amosis into Phœnicia &amp; Arabia Petrea &amp; there <a id="l3041"></a>mixed with the old inhabitants, who not long after being conquered by <a id="l3042"></a>David fled from him &amp; the Philistims by sea under the conduct of Cadmus <a id="l3043"></a>&amp; other captains into Asia minor Greece &amp; Libya to seek new seats, &amp; there <a id="l3044"></a>built towns erected kingdoms &amp; set on foot the worship of the dead: &amp; some <a id="l3045"></a>of those who remained in Iudea might assist David &amp; Solomon in building <a id="l3046"></a> Ierusalem &amp; the Temple. Among the forreign rites used by the stran<a id="l3047"></a>gers in Egypt  in worshipping the Gods, was the sacrificing of men, <a id="l3048"></a>For Amosis abolished that custome at Heliopolis. And therefore those <a id="l3049"></a>strangers were Canaanites, such as fled from Ioshua. For the Canaanites <a id="l3050"></a>gave their seed (that is their children) to Molech, &amp; burnt their sons &amp; their <a id="l3051"></a>daughters in the fire to their Gods (Deut. X11.31.) Manetho calls them Phe<a id="l3052"></a>nician strangers.</p>
<p id="par301">After Amosis had expelled the shepherds &amp; extended his dominion over <a id="l3053"></a>all Egypt, his son &amp; successor Amenemes or Ammon by much greater conquests <a id="l3054"></a>laid the foundation of the Egyptian empire. For by the assistance of his young <a id="l3055"></a>son Sesostris whom he brought up to hunting &amp; other laborious exercises, he <a id="l3056"></a>conquered Arabia Troglodytica &amp; Libya. And from him all Libya <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n270-ref">[270]</sup> was <a id="l3057"></a>anciently called Ammonia. And after his death, in the temples erected <a id="l3058"></a>to him at Thebes &amp; in Ammonia &amp; at Meroe in Æthiopia, they set up <a id="l3059"></a>Oracles to him, &amp; made the people worship him as the God that acted in <a id="l3060"></a>them. And these are the oldest Oracles mentioned in history, the Greeks <a id="l3061"></a>therein imitating the Ægyptians. For the <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n271-ref">[271]</sup> Oracle at Dodona was the <a id="l3062"></a>oldest in Greece, &amp; was set up by an Egyptian woman after the ex<a id="l3063"></a>ample of the Oracle of Iupiter Ammon at Thebes.</p>
<p id="par302">In the days of Ammon a body of the Edomites fled from David into <a id="l3064"></a>Egypt with their young king Hadad as above, &amp; carried thither their skill in <a id="l3065"></a>navigation. And this seems to have given occasion to the Egyptians to build a fleet <a id="l3066"></a>on the red sea near Coptos, &amp; might ingratiate Hadad with Pharaoh. For the Midi<a id="l3067"></a>anites &amp; Ishmaelites who bordered upon the red sea near mount Horeb on the <a id="l3068"></a>south side of Edom, were merchants from the days of Iacob the patriarch (Gen. <a id="l3069"></a>XXVII. 28, 36) &amp; by their merchandise the Midianites abounded with gold in <a id="l3070"></a>the days of Moses (Num. XXXI. 50, 51, 52) &amp; in the days of the Iudges of Israel <a id="l3071"></a>because they were Ishmaelites (Iudg. VIII. 24.) The Ishmaelites therefore <a id="l3072"></a>in those days grew rich by merchandise. They carried their merchandise on <a id="l3073"></a>camels through Petra to Rhinocolura &amp; thence to Egypt. And this trafic at length <a id="l3074"></a>came into the hands of David by his conquering the Edomites &amp; gaining the ports <a id="l3075"></a>of the red sea called Eloth &amp; Ezion-Geber as may  be understood by the 3000 talents of gold of Ophir which David gave to the Temple, 1 Chron. XXIX. 4. The Egyptians having the art of <a id="l3076"></a>making linen-cloth, they began about this time to build long ships with sails <a id="l3077"></a>in their port on those seas neare Coptos, &amp; having learnt the skill of the Edo<a id="l3078"></a>mites, they began now to observe the positions of the stars &amp; the length of the <a id="l3079"></a>solar year for enabling them to know the position of the stars at any time <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p058r"> &lt;58r&gt; </span> &amp; to sail by them at all times without sight of the shoar. And this gave a be<a id="l3080"></a>ginning to Astronomy &amp; Navigation. For hitherto they had gone only by the <a id="l3081"></a>shoar with oars in round vessels of burden first invented on that shallow sea  by <a id="l3082"></a>the posterity of Abraham; &amp; in passing from island to island guided themselves <a id="l3083"></a>by the sight of the islands in the day time or by the sight of some of the starrs <a id="l3084"></a>in the night. Their old year was the lunisolar year desended from Noah to all <a id="l3085"></a>his posterity till those days, &amp; consisted of twelve months each of thirty days <a id="l3086"></a>according to their calendar. And to the end of this calendar year they now <a id="l3087"></a>added five days, &amp; thereby made up the solar year of twelve months &amp; <a id="l3088"></a>five days or 365 days.</p>
<p id="par303">The ancient Egyptians feigned <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n272-ref">[272]</sup> that Rhea lay secretly with Saturn, <a id="l3089"></a>&amp; Sol prayed that she might bring forth neither in any month nor in the <a id="l3090"></a>year; &amp; that Mercury playing at dice with Luna, overcame, &amp; took from the <a id="l3091"></a>Lunar year the 72<sup>th</sup> part of every day, &amp; thereof composed five days, &amp; added <a id="l3092"></a>them to the year of 360 days that she might bring forth in them : &amp; that <a id="l3093"></a>the Egyptians celebrated those days as the birth days of Rhea's five children, <a id="l3094"></a>Osiris, Isis, Typhon, Orus senior, &amp; Nephthe the wife of Typhon. And there<a id="l3095"></a>fore according to the opinion of the ancient Egyptians the five days were <a id="l3096"></a>added to the Lunisolar  calendar - year, in the reign of Saturn &amp; Rhea the parents of Osiris, Isis, &amp; Typhon; that is, in the reign of Ammon <a id="l3097"></a>&amp; Titæa the parents of the Titans, or in the latter half of the reign of <a id="l3098"></a>David when those Titans were born, &amp; by consequence soon after the flight <a id="l3099"></a>of the Edomites from David into Egypt. But the Solstices not being yet <a id="l3100"></a>settled, the beginning of this new year might not be fixed to the vernal <a id="l3101"></a>Equinox before the reign of Amenophis the successor of Orus junior <a id="l3102"></a>the son of Osiris &amp; Isis.</p>
<p id="par304">When the Edomites fled from David with their young King Hadad into <a id="l3103"></a>Egypt, its probable that they carried thither also the use of letters. For letters <a id="l3104"></a>were then in use among the posterity of Abraham in Arabia Petræa &amp; upon the <a id="l3105"></a>borders of the red sea, the Law being written there by Moses in a book, &amp; in <a id="l3106"></a>tables of stone, long before. For Moses marrying the daughter of the prince <a id="l3107"></a>of Midian, &amp; dwelling with him forty years, learnt them among the Midian<a id="l3108"></a>ites. And Iob who lived <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n273-ref">[273]</sup> among their neighbours the Edomites mentions <a id="l3109"></a>the writing down of words as there in use in his days Iob. XIX. 23, 24. And <a id="l3110"></a>there's no instance of letters for writing down sounds being in use before <a id="l3111"></a>the days of David in any other nation besides the posterity of Abraham. <a id="l3112"></a>The Egyptians ascribed this invention to Thoth the secretary of Osiris: <a id="l3113"></a>&amp; therefore Letters began to be in use in Egypt in the days of Thoth, that <a id="l3114"></a>is, a little after the flight of the Edomites from David, or about the time <a id="l3115"></a>that Cadmus brought them into Europe.</p>
<p id="par305">Helladius <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n274-ref">[274]</sup> tells us that a man called Oes who appeared in the red <a id="l3116"></a>sea with the tayl of a fish (so they painted a seaman) taught Astronomy <a id="l3117"></a>&amp; letters. And Hyginus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n275-ref">[275]</sup> that Euhadnes who came out of the sea in Chaldæa, <a id="l3118"></a>taught the Chaldæans Astrology the first of any man; he means Astrono<a id="l3119"></a>my. And Alexander Polyhistor <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n276-ref">[276]</sup> tells us from Berosus that Oannes taught <a id="l3120"></a>the Chaldæans Letters, Mathematicks, Arts, Agriculture, cohabitation in <a id="l3121"></a>cities, &amp; the construction of Temples; &amp; that several such men came thither <a id="l3122"></a>successively. Oes, Euhadnes, &amp; Oannes, seem to be the same name a little <a id="l3123"></a>varied by corruption, &amp; this name seems to have been given in common to <a id="l3124"></a>several seamen who came thither from time to time, &amp; by consequence <a id="l3125"></a>were merchants &amp; frequented those seas with their merchandise, or else <a id="l3126"></a>fled from their enemies. So that Letters, Astronomy, Architecture &amp; Agri<a id="l3127"></a>culture came into Chaldæa by sea, &amp; were carried thither by seamen who fre<a id="l3128"></a>quented the Persian Gulph, &amp; came thither from time to time after all those <a id="l3129"></a>things were practised in other countries whence they came, &amp; by consequence <a id="l3130"></a>in the days of Ammon &amp; Sesac, David &amp; Solomon, &amp; their successors, or not <a id="l3131"></a>long before. The Chaldæans indeed made Oannes older than the flood of <a id="l3132"></a>Xisuthrus, but the Egyptians made Osiris as old, &amp; I make them contemporary.</p>
<p id="par306">The red sea had its name not from its colour but from Edom &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p059r"> &lt;59r&gt; </span> Erythra the names of Esau, which signify that colour. And some <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n277-ref">[277]</sup> tell us <a id="l3133"></a>that king Erythra (meaning Esau) invented the vessels [rates] in which they <a id="l3134"></a>navigated that sea, &amp; was buried in an island thereof neare the Persian <a id="l3135"></a>gulph. Whence it follows that the Edomites navigated that sea from  the <a id="l3136"></a>days of Esau. And there is no need that the oldest Oannes should be older. <a id="l3137"></a>There were boats upon rivers before, such as were the Boats which carried the <a id="l3138"></a>Patriarchs over Euphrates &amp; Iordan &amp; the first nations over many other <a id="l3139"></a>rivers for peopling the earth, seeking new seats, &amp; invading one anothers <a id="l3140"></a>territories. And after the example of such vessels, Ismael &amp; Midian <a id="l3141"></a>the sons of Abraham, &amp; Esau his grandson might build larger vessels <a id="l3142"></a>to go to the islands upon the red sea in searching for new seats, &amp; by <a id="l3143"></a>degrees learn to navigate that  sea as far as to the Persian <a id="l3144"></a>gulph. For ships were as old even upon the Mediterranean as the <a id="l3145"></a>days of Iacob. Gen. 49. 13. Iudg. 5.17. But it is probable that the merchants <a id="l3146"></a>of that sea were not forward to discover their arts &amp; sciences upon which <a id="l3147"></a>their trade depended.  It seems  therefore that Letters &amp; Astronomy &amp; the trade of <a id="l3151"></a>Carpenters were invented by the merchants of the red sea for writing <a id="l3152"></a>down their merchandise &amp; keeping their accounts &amp; guiding their ships <a id="l3153"></a>in the night by the stars &amp; building ships; &amp; that they were propagated <a id="l3154"></a>from Arabia Petrea into Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Asia minor, &amp; Europe <a id="l3155"></a>much about one &amp; the same time, the time in which David conquered <a id="l3156"></a>&amp; dispersed those merchants. For we hear nothing of Letters before the <a id="l3157"></a>Days of David. except among the posterity of Abraham; nothing of Astro<a id="l3158"></a>nomy before the Egyptians under Ammon &amp; Sesac applied themselves to <a id="l3159"></a>that study, except the Constellations mentioned by Iob who lived in Ara<a id="l3160"></a>bia Petræa among the merchants; nothing of the trade of Carpenters <a id="l3161"></a>or good architecture before Solomon sent to Hiram King Tyre to <a id="l3162"></a>supply him with  such artificers, saying that <em class="underline">there were none in <a id="l3163"></a>Israel who could skill to hew timber like the Zidonians</em>.</p>
<p id="par307">Diodorus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n278-ref">[278]</sup> tells us that the Egyptians sent many colonies out of Egypt into <a id="l3164"></a>other countries, &amp; that Belus the son of Neptune &amp; Libya carried colonies thence <a id="l3165"></a>into Babylonia, &amp; seating himself on Euphrates, instituted priests free from <a id="l3166"></a>taxes &amp; public expenses after the manner of Egypt, who were called Chaldæ<a id="l3167"></a>ans, &amp; who after the manner of Egypt might observe the starrs.

<p id="par318">And As the Egyptians Phenicians &amp; Syrians in those days deified <a id="l3353"></a>their Kings &amp; princes, so upon their coming into Asia minor &amp; <a id="l3354"></a>Greece they taught those nations to do the like, as hath been shewed <a id="l3355"></a>above. In those days the writing of the Thebans &amp; Ethiopians <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p063r"> &lt;63r&gt; </span> was in hieroglyphicks. And this way of writing seems to have spread into <a id="l3356"></a>the lower Egypt before the days of Moses. For thence came the worship of <a id="l3357"></a>their Gods in the various shapes of birds beasts &amp; fishes, forbidden in the second <a id="l3358"></a>commandment. Now this emblematical way of writing gave occasion to the Thebans <a id="l3359"></a>&amp; Ethiopians, who in the days of Samuel, David, Solomon, &amp; Rehoboam conquered <a id="l3360"></a>Egypt &amp; the nations round about &amp; erected a great Empire, to represent &amp; signi<a id="l3361"></a>fy their conquering Kings &amp; princes, not by writing down their names, but <a id="l3362"></a>by making various hieroglyphical figures; as by painting Ammon with ram's <a id="l3363"></a>horns to signify the King who conquered Libya, a country abounding with sheep, <a id="l3364"></a>his father Amosis with a sith to signify that King who conquered the lower <a id="l3365"></a>Egypt a country abounding with corn; his son Osiris by an ox because he <a id="l3366"></a>taught the conquered nations to plow with oxen; Bacchus with bulls horns <a id="l3367"></a>for the same reason, &amp; with grapes because he taught the nations to plant <a id="l3368"></a>vines, &amp; upon a Tiger because he  subdued India; Orus the son of <a id="l3369"></a>Osiris with a harp to signify the Prince who was eminently skilled on that <a id="l3370"></a>instrument; Iupiter upon an eagle to signify the sublimity of his dominion <a id="l3371"></a>&amp; with a thunderbolt to represent him a warrior; Venus in a chariot <a id="l3372"></a>drawn with two doves to represent her amorous &amp; lustful; Neptune with <a id="l3373"></a>a trident to signify the commander of a fleet composed of three squadrons; <a id="l3374"></a>Ægeon (a gyant) with 50 heads &amp; an hundred hands to signify Neptune <a id="l3375"></a>with his men in a ship of fifty oars; Thoth with a dogs head &amp; wings at <a id="l3376"></a>his cap &amp; feet &amp; a caduceus writhen about with two serpents, to signify a <a id="l3377"></a>man of craft &amp; an embassadour who reconciled two contending nations; <a id="l3378"></a>Pan with a pipe &amp; the leggs of a goat to signify a man delighted in piping <a id="l3379"></a>&amp; dancing; &amp; Hercules with Pillars &amp; a club, because Sesostris set up <a id="l3380"></a>pillars in all his conquests, &amp; fought against the Libyans with clubs. <a id="l3381"></a>This is that Hercules who (according to <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n313-ref">[313]</sup> Eudoxus) was slain by Typhon &amp; <a id="l3382"></a>(according to Ptolomæus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n314-ref">[314]</sup> Hephæstion) was called Nilus, &amp; who conquered <a id="l3383"></a>Gerion with his three sons in Spain &amp; set up the famous pillars at the <a id="l3384"></a>mouth of the Straits. For Diodorus <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n315-ref">[315]</sup> mentioning three Herculess, the Egyptian <a id="l3385"></a>the Tyrian &amp; the son of Alcmena, saith that the oldest flourished among <a id="l3386"></a>the Egyptians, &amp; having conquered a great part of the world set up the <a id="l3387"></a>pillars in Afric.

<p id="par319">The <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n319-ref">[319]</sup> Atlantides (a people upon mount Atlas conquered by the Egyp<a id="l3398"></a>tians in the reign of Ammon,) related that Vranus was their first King, <a id="l3399"></a>&amp; reduced them from a salvage course of life, &amp; caused them to dwell <a id="l3400"></a>in towns &amp; cities, &amp; lay up &amp; use the fruits of the earth, &amp; that he reigned <a id="l3401"></a>over a great part of the world, &amp; by his wife Titæa had eighteen chil<a id="l3402"></a>dren among which were  Hyperion &amp; Basilea the parents of <a id="l3403"></a>Helio &amp; Selene; that the brothers of Hyperion slew him, &amp; drowned his <a id="l3404"></a>son Helio (the Phaeton of the ancients) in the Nile, &amp; divided his Kingdom <a id="l3405"></a>amongst themselves; &amp; the country bordering upon the ocean fell to the <a id="l3406"></a>lot of Atlas, from whom the people were called Atlantides.

<p id="par320">For Solon having travelled into Egypt &amp; conversed with the priests of <a id="l3411"></a>Sais about their antiquities, wrote a poem of what he had learnt, but did <a id="l3412"></a>not finish it. And this Poem fell into the hands of Plato who relates out <a id="l3413"></a>of it, that at the mouth of the straits neare Hercules's pillars there <a id="l3414"></a>was an Island called Atlantis, the people of which nine thousand <a id="l3415"></a>years before the days of Solon reigned over Libya as far as Egypt <a id="l3416"></a>&amp; over Europe as far as the Tyrrhene sea. And all this force col<a id="l3417"></a>lected into one body invaded Egypt &amp; Greece &amp; whatever was contain<a id="l3418"></a>ed within the pillars of Hercules, but was resisted &amp; stopt by the <a id="l3419"></a>Athenians &amp; other Greeks, &amp; thereby the rest of the nations not <a id="l3420"></a>yet conquered  were preserved. He saith also that <a id="l3421"></a>in those days the Gods [having finished their conquests] divided the <a id="l3422"></a>whole earth amongst themselves, partly into larger partly into ~ <a id="l3423"></a>smaller portions  &amp; instituted Temples  &amp; sacred rites <a id="l3424"></a>to them selves; &amp; that the island Atlantis fell to the lot of Neptune <a id="l3425"></a>who made his eldest son Atlas King of the whole Island, a part of which <a id="l3426"></a>was called Gadir; &amp; that in the history of the said warrs mention was <a id="l3427"></a>made of Cecrops, Erechtheus, Erechthonius &amp; others before  <a id="l3428"></a>Theseus, &amp; also of the weomen who warred with the men, &amp; of the habit &amp; statu of Minerva, the study of warr in those days being common <a id="l3429"></a>to men &amp; weomen. By all these circumstances it is manifest that these <a id="l3430"></a>Gods were the <em class="underline">Dij magni majorum gentium</em> , &amp; lived between the age <a id="l3431"></a>of Cecrops &amp;  Theseus, &amp; that the warrs which Sesostris with <a id="l3432"></a>his brother Neptune made upon the nations  by land &amp; sea, <a id="l3433"></a>&amp; the resistance he met with in Greece, &amp; the following invasion of <a id="l3434"></a>Egypt by Neptune are here described; &amp; how the captains of Sesostris <a id="l3435"></a>shared his conquests amongst themselves, as the captains of Alex<a id="l3436"></a>ander the great did his conquests long after; &amp; instituting Temples <a id="l3437"></a>&amp; Priests &amp; sacred rites to themselves, caused the nations to worship <a id="l3438"></a>them after death as Gods : &amp; that the island Gadir or Gades with <a id="l3439"></a>all Libya fell to the lot of him who after death was deified by the <a id="l3440"></a>name of Neptune. The time therefore when these things were done is by <a id="l3441"></a>Solon limited to the age of Neptune the father of Atlas,  For Homer tells us <a id="l3442"></a>that Vlysses presently after the Trojan war found Calypso the daughter <a id="l3443"></a>of Atlas in the Ogygian island (perhaps Gadir,) &amp; therefore it was but <a id="l3444"></a>two generations before the Trojan war. This is that Neptune, who <a id="l3445"></a>with Apollo or Orus fortified Troy with a wall in the reign of Lao<a id="l3446"></a>medon, the father of Priamus, &amp; left many natural children in <a id="l3447"></a>Greece some of which were Argonauts &amp; others were contemporary <a id="l3448"></a>to the Argonauts: &amp; therefore he flourished but one generation <a id="l3449"></a>before the Argonautic expedition, &amp; by consequence about 400 years <a id="l3450"></a>before Solon went into Egypt. But the Priests of Egypt in those 400 <a id="l3451"></a>years had magnified the stories &amp; antiquity of their Gods so ex<a id="l3452"></a>ceedingly as to make them nine thousand years older than Solon, &amp; <a id="l3453"></a>the island Atlantis bigger than all Afric &amp; Asia together, &amp; full <a id="l3454"></a>of people. And because in the days of Solon this great island did not <a id="l3455"></a>appear, they pretended that it was sunk into the sea with all its <a id="l3456"></a>people. Thus great was the vanity of the Priests of Egypt in mag<a id="l3457"></a>nifying their antiquities.</p>
<p id="par321">The Cretans <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n320-ref">[320]</sup> affirmed that <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n321-ref">[321]</sup> <em class="underline">Neptune was the first man who <a id="l3458"></a>set out a fleet, having obteined this Prefecture of [his father] Saturn, <a id="l3459"></a>whence posterity recconed things done in  the sea to be under his</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p065r"> &lt;65r&gt; </span> government &amp; mariners honoured him with sacrifices. The inventi<a id="l3460"></a>on of tall ships with sails <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n322-ref">[322]</sup> is also ascribed to him. He was first worship<a id="l3461"></a>ped in Africa as Herodotus <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n323-ref">[323]</sup> affirms, &amp; therefore reigned over that province. <a id="l3462"></a>For his eldest son Atlas who succeeded him was not only lord of the <a id="l3463"></a>Island Atlantis, but also reigned over a great part of Afric, giving <a id="l3464"></a>his name to the people called Atlantij &amp; to the mountain Atlas &amp; the <a id="l3465"></a>Atlantic ocean. The <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n324-ref">[324]</sup> outmost parts of the earth &amp; promontories &amp; what<a id="l3466"></a>ever bordered upon the sea &amp; was washed by it, the Egyptians called <a id="l3467"></a>Neptys, &amp; on the coasts of Marmorica &amp; Cyrene Bochart &amp; Arius <a id="l3468"></a>Montanus place the Naphthuhim a people sprung from Misraim, Gen. x. <a id="l3469"></a>13. And thence Neptune &amp; his wife Neptys might have their names, <a id="l3470"></a>the words Neptune, Neptys, &amp; Naphtuim signifying the King, Queen, <a id="l3471"></a>&amp; people of the sea coasts. The Greeks tell us that Iapetus was <a id="l3472"></a>the father of Atlas, &amp; Bochart derives Iapetus &amp; Neptune from the <a id="l3473"></a>same original. He &amp; his son Atlas are celebrated in the ancient fables <a id="l3474"></a>for making war upon the Gods of Egypt: as when Lucian <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n325-ref">[325]</sup> saith that Corinth <a id="l3475"></a>being full of fables, tells the fight of Sol &amp; Neptune, that is, of Apollo <a id="l3476"></a>&amp; Python or Orus &amp; Typhon; &amp; where Agatharcides <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n326-ref">[326]</sup> relates how the <a id="l3477"></a>Gods of Egypt fled from the Gyants till the Titans came in &amp; saved them <a id="l3478"></a>by putting Neptune to flight: &amp; where Hyginus <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n327-ref">[327]</sup> tells the war between <a id="l3479"></a>the Gods of Ægypt &amp; the Titans commanded by Atlas. The Titans <a id="l3480"></a>are the posterity of Titæa, some of whom under Hercules assisted <a id="l3481"></a>the Gods, others under Neptune &amp; Atlas warred against them: for <a id="l3482"></a>which reason, saith Plutarch, <sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n328-ref">[328]</sup> the priests of Egypt abominated the <a id="l3483"></a>sea, &amp; had Neptune in no honour. By Hercules I understand here <a id="l3484"></a>the General of the forces of Thebais &amp; Ethiopia whom the Gods or <a id="l3485"></a>great men of Egypt called to their assistance against the Giants <a id="l3486"></a>or great men of Libya who had slain Osiris &amp; invaded Egypt. For <a id="l3487"></a>Diodorus <sup>i</sup><sup class="note" id="n329-ref">[329]</sup> saith that when Osiris made his expedition over the world, <a id="l3488"></a>he left his kinsman Hercules general of his forces over all his domi<a id="l3489"></a>nions &amp; Antæus governor of Libya &amp; Æthiopia. Antæus reigned over <a id="l3490"></a>all Afric to the Atlantic ocean &amp; built Tingis or Tangieres. Pindar <sup>k</sup><sup class="note" id="n330-ref">[330]</sup> tells <a id="l3491"></a>us that he reigned at Irasa a town of Libya where Cyrene was afterwards <a id="l3492"></a>built. He invaded Egypt &amp; Thebais: for he was beaten by Hercules &amp; <a id="l3493"></a>the Egyptians near Antæa or Antæopolis a town of Thebais, &amp; Diodo<a id="l3494"></a>rus <sup>l</sup><sup class="note" id="n331-ref">[331]</sup> tells us that this town had its name from Antæus whom Hercules <a id="l3495"></a>slew in the days of Osiris. Hercules overthrew him several times, &amp; every <a id="l3496"></a>time he grew stronger by recruits from Libya his mother earth. But <a id="l3497"></a>Hercules intercepted his recruits &amp; at length slew him. In these warrs <a id="l3498"></a>Hercules took the Libyan world from Atlas, &amp;  made Atlas pay tribute <a id="l3499"></a>out of his golden  Orchard, the kingdom of Afric. Antæus &amp; Atlas <a id="l3500"></a>were both of them sons of Neptune, both of them reigned over all <a id="l3501"></a>Libya &amp; Afric between mount Atlas &amp; the mediterranean to the very <a id="l3502"></a>Ocean, both of them invaded Egypt &amp; contended with Hercules in the <a id="l3503"></a>wars of the Gods, &amp; therefore they are but two names of one &amp; the <a id="l3504"></a>same man. And even the name Atlas  in the oblique cases seems <a id="l3505"></a>to have been compounded of the name Antæeus &amp; some other word <a id="l3506"></a>(perhaps the word <em class="underline">Atal</em>, <em class="underline">cursed</em>) put before it.

<p id="par322">This warr was at length composed by the intervention of Mercury, who <a id="l3508"></a>in memory thereof was said to reconcile two contending serpents by <a id="l3509"></a>casting his embassadors rod between them. And thus much concerning the ~ <a id="l3510"></a>ancient state of Egypt, Libya, &amp; Greece described by Solon.</p>
<p id="par323">The mythology of the Cretans differed in some things from that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p066r"> &lt;66r&gt; </span> of Egypt &amp; Libya. For in the Cretan mythology, Cœlus &amp; Terra or Vranus <a id="l3511"></a>&amp; Titæa were the parents of Saturn &amp; Rhea, &amp; Saturn &amp; Rhea were <a id="l3512"></a>the parents of Iupiter &amp; Iuno, &amp; Hyperion Iapetus &amp; the Titans were <a id="l3513"></a>one generation older than Iupiter. And Saturn was expelled his kingdom <a id="l3514"></a>&amp; castrated by his son Iupiter: which fable hath no place in the mythology of <a id="l3515"></a>Egypt.</p>
<p id="par324">During the reign of Sesac, Ieroboam being in subjection to Egypt, <a id="l3516"></a>set up the Gods of Egypt in Dan &amp; Bethel, &amp; <em class="underline">Israel was without a teaching <a id="l3517"></a>priest &amp; without law, &amp; the nations were in great adversity. For in those <a id="l3518"></a>times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but <a id="l3519"></a>great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries. And nation <a id="l3520"></a>was destroyed of nation, &amp; city of city: for God did vex them sore</em>, 2 Chron. <a id="l3521"></a>xv. 3, 5, 6. But in the fift year of Asa, the land of Iudah became quiet <a id="l3522"></a>from war &amp; from thence had quiet ten years; &amp; Asa took away the altars of strange <a id="l3523"></a>Gods &amp; brake down the images, &amp; built the fenced cities of Iudah with <a id="l3524"></a>walls &amp; towers &amp; gates &amp; barrs, having rest on every side, &amp; got up an <a id="l3525"></a>army of 580000 men with which in the fifteenth year of his reign he <a id="l3526"></a>met Zerah the Ethiopian who came out against him with an army <a id="l3527"></a>of a thousand thousand Ethiopians &amp; Libyans. The way of the Libyans <a id="l3528"></a>was through Egypt, &amp; therefore Zerah was  now Lord of Egypt. They <a id="l3529"></a>fought at Maresha near Gerar between Egypt &amp; Iudæa, &amp; Zerah <a id="l3530"></a>was beaten so that he could not recover himself. And from all this <a id="l3531"></a>I seem to gather that Osiris was slain in the fift year of Asa, &amp; <a id="l3532"></a>thereupon Egypt fell into civil wars being invaded by the Libyans &amp; <a id="l3533"></a>defended by the Ethiopians for a time, &amp; after  ten years more <a id="l3534"></a>being invaded by the Ethiopians who slew Orus the son &amp; successor of <a id="l3535"></a>Osiris, drowning him in the Nile, &amp; seized his kingdom. By these <a id="l3536"></a>civil wars of Egypt, the land of Iudah had rest ten years. Osiris or <a id="l3537"></a>Sesostris reigned long, Manetho saith  48 years: a&amp; by this recconing <a id="l3538"></a>he began to reign about the 17<sup>th</sup> year of Solomon; &amp; Orus his son <a id="l3539"></a>was drowned in  the 15<sup>th</sup> year of Asa. For Pliny <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n332-ref">[332]</sup> tells us: <a id="l3540"></a><em class="underline">Ægyptiorum bellis attrita est Æthiopia vicissim imperitando serviendoque <a id="l3541"></a>clara. et potens, etiam usque ad Trojana bella Memnone regnante</em>.<a id="l3542"></a> Ethiopia served Ægypt till the death <a id="l3544"></a>of Sesostris &amp; no longer. For Herodotus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n333-ref">[333]</sup> tells us that he alone enjoyed <a id="l3545"></a>the Empire of Ethiopia. Then the Ethiopians became free, &amp; after <a id="l3546"></a>ten years became Lords of Egypt &amp; Libya under Zerah &amp; Amenophis.</p>
<p id="par325">When Asa by his victory over Zerah became safe from <a id="l3547"></a>Egypt, he assembled all the people &amp; they offered sacrifices out of <a id="l3548"></a>the spoiles, &amp; entered into a covenant upon oath to seek the Lord; &amp; <a id="l3549"></a>in lieu of the vessels taken away by Sesac, he brought into the <a id="l3550"></a>house of the Lord the things that he &amp; his father had dedicated, <a id="l3551"></a>the gold &amp; the silver &amp; the vessels. 2 Chron. xv.</p>
<p id="par326">When Zerah was beaten so that he could not recover himself <a id="l3552"></a>the people <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n334-ref">[334]</sup> of the lower Egypt revolted from the Ethiopians &amp; called <a id="l3553"></a>in to their assistance two hundred thousand Iews &amp; Canaanites, &amp; <a id="l3554"></a>under the conduct of one Osarsiphus (a priest of Egypt called Vsorthon, <a id="l3555"></a>Osorchon, Osorchor &amp; Hercules Ægyptius by Manetho) caused the Ethio<a id="l3556"></a>pians now under Memnon to retire to Memphis.

<p id="par327">Tithonus a beautiful youth, the elder brother of Priam, went <a id="l3564"></a>into Ethiopia, being carried thither among many captives by Sesostris: <a id="l3565"></a>&amp; the Greeks,before the days of Hesiod, feigned  that Memnon was his <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p067r"> &lt;67r&gt; </span> son. Memnon therefore in the opinion of those ancient Greeks, <a id="l3566"></a>was one generation younger than Tithonus &amp; was born after <a id="l3567"></a>the return of Sesostris into Egypt: suppose about 16 or 20 years <a id="l3568"></a>after the death of Solomon. He is said to have lived very long, &amp; so might <a id="l3569"></a>dye about 95 years after Solomon, as we recconed above. His mother <a id="l3570"></a>called Cispa by Æschylus, in a statue erected to her in Egypt, <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n335-ref">[335]</sup> was <a id="l3571"></a>represented the daughter the wife &amp; the mother of a king, &amp; there<a id="l3572"></a>fore he was the son of a King : which makes it probable that <a id="l3573"></a>Zerah whom he succeeded in the Kingdom of Ethiopia was his father.</p>
<p id="par328">Historians <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n336-ref">[336]</sup> agree that Menes reigned in Egypt next after <a id="l3574"></a>the Gods, &amp; turned the river into a new channel &amp; built a bridge over it &amp; built Memphis &amp; the magnificent Temple of Vulcan. <a id="l3575"></a>He built Memphis over against the place where Gran Cairo now <a id="l3576"></a>stands, called by the Arabian historians Mesir. He built only the <a id="l3577"></a>body of the temple of Vulcan, &amp; his successors Ramesses or Rhamp<a id="l3578"></a>sinitus, Mæris, Asychis, &amp; Psammiticus built the western, northern, <a id="l3579"></a>eastern &amp; southern Porticos thereof. Psammiticus who built the <a id="l3580"></a>last Portico of this Temple, reigned three hundred years after the <a id="l3581"></a>victory of Asa over Zerah, &amp; it is not likely that this  Temple ~ <a id="l3582"></a>could be above three hundred years in building, or that any Menes <a id="l3583"></a>could be King of all Egypt before the expulsion of the shepherds. The <a id="l3584"></a>last of the Gods of Egypt was Orus with his mother Isis &amp; sister <a id="l3585"></a>Bubaste &amp; Secretary Thoth &amp; Vnkle Typhon. Aand the King who <a id="l3586"></a>reigned next after all their deaths &amp; turned the river &amp; built a bridge over it  &amp; built Memphis &amp; the temple <a id="l3587"></a>of Vulcan, was Memnon or Amenophis called by the Egyptians <a id="l3588"></a>Amenoph; &amp; therefore he is Menes. For the names Amenoph, <a id="l3589"></a>or Menoph &amp; Menes do not much differ. And from Amenoph the <a id="l3590"></a>city Memphis built by Menes had its  Egyptian names Moph, <a id="l3591"></a>Noph, Menoph or Menuf as it is still called by the Arabian histo<a id="l3592"></a>rians. The necessity of fortifying this place against Osarsiphus <a id="l3593"></a>gave occasion to the building of it.</p>
<p id="par329">In the time of the revolt of the lower Ægypt under Osarsiphus, &amp; the <a id="l3594"></a>retirement of Amenophis into Æthiopia, Ægypt being then in the greatest ~<a id="l3595"></a>distraction, the Greeks built the ship Argo, &amp; sent in it the flower of Greece <a id="l3596"></a>to Æetes at Colchos &amp; to many other Princes on the coasts of the Euxine &amp; <a id="l3597"></a>Mediterranean seas: And this ship was built after the pattern of an Egyptian <a id="l3598"></a>ship with fifty oars in which Danaus with his fifty daughters a few years <a id="l3599"></a>before fled from Egypt into Greece, &amp; was the first long ship with sails built <a id="l3600"></a>by the Greeks. And such an improvement of navigation with a designe to send <a id="l3601"></a>the flower of Greece to many Princes upon the sea coasts of the Euxine &amp; Mediterranean seas was too great an undertaking to be set on foot without <a id="l3602"></a>the concurrence of the Princes &amp; States of Greece, &amp; perhaps the approba<a id="l3603"></a>tion of the Amphictyonic Council. For it was done by the dictate of the <a id="l3604"></a>Oracle. This council met every half year upon state affairs for the well<a id="l3605"></a>fare of Greece, &amp; therefore knew of this expedition, &amp; might send the Argonauts <a id="l3606"></a>upon an embassy to the said Princes, &amp; for concealing their designe might <a id="l3607"></a>make the fable of the golden fleece in relation to the ship of Phrixus whose <a id="l3608"></a>ensign was a golden ram. And probably their designe was to notify the dis<a id="l3609"></a>traction of Egypt, &amp; the invasion thereof by the Ethiopians &amp; Israelites, to the <a id="l3610"></a>said Princes, &amp; to persuade them to take that opportunity to revolt from <a id="l3611"></a>Egypt &amp; set up for themselves &amp; make a league with the Greeks. For the Argonauts went through <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n337-ref">[337]</sup> the Kingdom of Colchos by land to the Armenians <a id="l3612"></a>&amp; through Armenia to the Medes, which could not have been done if they <a id="l3613"></a>had not made friendship with the nations through which they passed. They <a id="l3614"></a>visited also Laomedon King of the Trojans, Phineus King of the Thracians, <a id="l3615"></a>Cizicus King of the Doleans, Lycus King of the Mariandini, &amp; the coasts <a id="l3616"></a>of Mysia &amp; Taurica Chersonesus, &amp; the nations upon the Tanais, &amp; the people <a id="l3617"></a>about Byzantium, &amp; the coasts of Epire, Corsica, Melita, Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, <a id="l3618"></a>&amp; Gallia upon the mediterranean; &amp; from thence they <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n338-ref">[338]</sup> crossed the sea to Afric <a id="l3619"></a>&amp; there conferred with Euripylus King of Cyrene. And <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n339-ref">[339]</sup> Strabo tells us that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p068r"> &lt;68r&gt; </span> in Armenia &amp; Media &amp; the neighbouring places, there were frequent <a id="l3620"></a>monuments of the expedition of Iason; as also about Sinope &amp; its sea coasts, <a id="l3621"></a>Propontis &amp; the Hellespont, &amp; in the Mediterranean. And a message by the <a id="l3622"></a>flower of Greece to so many nations could be on no other account than <a id="l3623"></a>state polic. These nations had been invaded by the Egyptians, but after <a id="l3624"></a>this expedition we hear no more of their continuing in subjection to Egypt.</p>
<p id="par330">The <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n340-ref">[340]</sup> Egyptians originally lived on the fruits of the earth &amp; fared <a id="l3625"></a>hardly &amp; abstained from animals, &amp; therefore abominated shepherds. Menes <a id="l3626"></a>taught them to adorn their beds &amp; tables with rich furniture &amp; carpets, &amp; brought <a id="l3627"></a>in amongst them a sumptuous delicious &amp; voluptuous way of life. And about <a id="l3628"></a>a hundred years after his death, Gnephacthus one of his successors cursed him <a id="l3629"></a>for it, &amp; to reduce the luxury of Egypt, caused the curse to be entered in <a id="l3630"></a>the Temple of Iupiter at Thebes. And by this curse the honour of Menes <a id="l3631"></a>was diminished among the Egyptians.</p>
<p id="par331">The Kings of Egypt who expelled the shepherds &amp; succeeded them, reigned, <a id="l3632"></a>I think, first at Coptos, &amp; then at Thebes, &amp; then at Memphis. At Coptos I <a id="l3633"></a>place Misphragmuthosis &amp; Amosis or Thomosis who expelled the shepherds &amp; <a id="l3634"></a>abolished their custome of sacrificing men, &amp; extended the Coptic language <a id="l3635"></a>&amp; the name of Αια Κόπτου Ægyptus to the conquest. Then Thebes became <a id="l3636"></a>the royal city of Ammon &amp; from him was called No–Ammon, &amp; his con<a id="l3637"></a>quest on the west of Egypt was called Ammonia.  After him in the same city of Thebes <a id="l3638"></a>reigned  Osiris, Orus, Menes or Amenophis, &amp; Ramesses: but <a id="l3639"></a>Memphis &amp; her miracles were not yet celebrated in Greece. For Homer <a id="l3640"></a>celebrates Thebes as in its glory  in his days, &amp; makes no mention of <a id="l3641"></a>Memphys. After Menes had built Memphys, Mœris the successor of <a id="l3642"></a>Ramesses adorned it &amp; made it the seat of the Kingdome, &amp; this was <a id="l3643"></a>almost two generations after the Trojan war.  Cinyras, the Vulcan <a id="l3644"></a>who married Venus &amp; under the Kings of Egypt reigned over Cyprus &amp; <a id="l3645"></a>part of Phœnicia &amp; made armour for those kings, lived till after the <a id="l3646"></a>times of the Trojan war. And upon his death Menes or Memnon might <a id="l3647"></a>deify him &amp; found the famous temple of Vulcan in that city for his wor<a id="l3648"></a>ship, but not live to finish it. In a plane <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n341-ref">[341]</sup> not far from Memphis are many <a id="l3649"></a>small Pyramids said to be built by Venephes or Enephes; &amp; I suspect <a id="l3650"></a>that Venephes &amp; Enephes have been corruptly written for Menephes <a id="l3651"></a>or Amenophis, the letters AM being almost worn out in some old <a id="l3652"></a>manuscript. For after the example of these  Pyramids, the follo<a id="l3653"></a>wing kings Mœris &amp; his successors built others much larger. The plane <a id="l3654"></a>in which they were built was the burying place of that city, as appears <a id="l3655"></a>by the Mummies there found; &amp; therefore the Pyramids were the se<a id="l3656"></a>pulchral monuments of the kings &amp; princes of that city. And by these &amp; <a id="l3657"></a>such like works the city grew famous soon after the days of Homer, who <a id="l3658"></a>therefore flourished in the reign of Ramesses.</p>
<p id="par332">Herodotus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n342-ref">[342]</sup> is the oldest historian now extant who wrote <a id="l3659"></a>of the antiquities of Egypt &amp; had what he wrote from <a id="l3660"></a>the priests of that country. And Diodorus who wrote almost 400 years <a id="l3661"></a>after him, &amp; had his relations also from the priests of Egypt, placed <a id="l3662"></a>many nameless Kings between those whom Herodotus placed in continu<a id="l3663"></a>al  succession. The Priests of Egypt had therefore, between the <a id="l3664"></a>days of Herodotus &amp; Diodorus, out of vanity, very much increased <a id="l3665"></a>the number of their Kings. And what they did after the days of He<a id="l3666"></a>rodotus, they began to do before his days. For he tells us that they <a id="l3667"></a>recited to him out of their books, the names of 330 Kings who ~ <a id="l3668"></a>reigned after Menes but did nothing memorable except Nitocris <a id="l3669"></a>&amp; Mœris the last of them. All these reigned at Thebes till Mœris translated the seat of the empire from Thebes to Memphis. After Mœris he reccons Sesostris, Pheron, <a id="l3670"></a>Proteus, Rhampsinitus, Cheops, Cephren, Mycerinus, Asychis, <a id="l3671"></a>Anysis,  Sabacus, Anysis again, Sethon, twelve <a id="l3672"></a>contemporary Kings, Psammitichus, Nechus, Psammis, Apries, Amasis, <a id="l3673"></a>&amp; Psammenitus. The Egyptians had before the days of Solon made <a id="l3674"></a>their monarchy 9000 years old, &amp; now they reccon to Herodotus <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p069r"> &lt;69r&gt; </span> a succession of 330 kings reigning so many generations, that is about <a id="l3675"></a>11000 years, before Sesostris. But the kings who reigned long before <a id="l3676"></a>Sesostris might reign over several little kingdoms in several parts of <a id="l3677"></a>Egypt before the rise of their monarchy, &amp; by consequence before the <a id="l3678"></a>days of Eli &amp; Samuel, &amp; so are not under our consideration: &amp; these <a id="l3679"></a>names may have been multiplied by corruption. And some of them, (as <a id="l3680"></a>Athothes or Thoth, the secretary of Osiris; Tosorthrus or Æsculapius <a id="l3681"></a>a physician who invented building with square stones; &amp; Thuor or Polybus <a id="l3682"></a>the husband of Alcandra,) were only Princes of Ægypt. If with Hero<a id="l3683"></a>dotus we omit the names of those Kings who did nothing memorable &amp; <a id="l3684"></a>consider only those whose actions are recorded, &amp; who left splendid <a id="l3685"></a>monuments of their having reigned over Egypt, (such as were tem<a id="l3686"></a>ples, Statues, Pyramids, Obelisks, &amp; palaces dedicated or ascribed to them) <a id="l3687"></a>these kings reduced into good order will give us all or almost all the <a id="l3688"></a>kings of Egypt from the days of the expulsion of the shepherds &amp; founding <a id="l3689"></a>of the monarchy downwards to the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses. For <a id="l3690"></a>Sesostris reigned in the age of the Gods of Egypt being deified by the names <a id="l3691"></a>of Osiris, Hercules &amp; Bacchus as above: &amp; therefore Menes, Nitocris, &amp; <a id="l3692"></a>Mœris are to be placed after him. Menes &amp; his son Ramesses reigned <a id="l3693"></a>next after the Gods &amp; therefore Nitocris &amp; Mœris reigned after <a id="l3694"></a>Ramesses. Mœris is set down immediately before Cheops three times <a id="l3695"></a>in the Dynasty of the Kings of Egypt composed by Eratosthenes &amp; once <a id="l3696"></a>in the Dynasties of Manetho: &amp; in the same Dynasties Nitocris is set <a id="l3697"></a>after the builders of the three great pyramids, &amp; according to Herodotus her brother <a id="l3698"></a>reigned before her &amp; was slain &amp; she revenged his death &amp; according <a id="l3699"></a>to Syncellus she built the third great Pyramid. And the builders of the Pyramids reigned at Memphis, &amp; by consequence after Mœris. And from these things I <a id="l3700"></a>gather that the Kings of Egypt mentioned by Herodotus ought to <a id="l3701"></a>be placed in this order. Sesostris, Pheron, Proteus, Menes, Rhamp<a id="l3702"></a>sinitus, Mœris, Cheops, Cephren, Mycerinus, Nitocris, Asychis, Any<a id="l3703"></a>sis  Sabacon, Anysis again, Sethon, twelve contemporary <a id="l3704"></a>Kings, Psammitichus, Nechus, Psammis, Apries, Amosis, Psamminitus.</p>
<p id="par333">Pheron is by Herodotus said to be the son &amp; successor of Sesostris. <a id="l3705"></a>He was deified by the name of Orus.</p>
<p id="par334">Proteus reigned in the lower Egypt when Paris sailed thither  that is, at the end of the Trojan war, according to <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n343-ref">[343]</sup> Herodotus. And <a id="l3706"></a>at that time Amenophis was King of Egypt &amp; Ethiopia. But in his absence Proteus might <a id="l3707"></a>be governour of some part of the lower Egypt under him. For Homer <a id="l3708"></a>places Proteus upon the sea coasts &amp;; makes him a sea God, &amp; calls <a id="l3709"></a>him the servant of Neptune. And Herodotus saith that he rose up <a id="l3710"></a>from among the common people, &amp; that Proteus was his name trans<a id="l3711"></a>lated into Greek, &amp; this name in Greek signifies only a Prince or <a id="l3712"></a>President. He succeeded Pheron &amp; was succeeded by Rhampsiniitus according to Hero<a id="l3713"></a>dotus; &amp; so was contemporary to Amenophis.</p>
<p id="par335">Amenophis reigned next after Orus &amp; Isis the last of the Gods. <a id="l3714"></a>He reigned at first over all Egypt &amp; then over Memphis &amp; the upper parts of Egypt. <a id="l3715"></a>And by conquering Osarsiphus who had revolted from him, became <a id="l3716"></a>king of all Egypt again, about 51 years after the death of Solomon. He built Memphis &amp; <a id="l3717"></a>ordered the worship of the Gods of Egypt &amp; built a palace at Abydus <a id="l3718"></a>&amp; the Memnonia at This &amp; Susa &amp; the magnificent temple of Vulcan  in Memphis, the building with square stones <a id="l3719"></a>being found out before by Tosorthrus the Æsculapius of Egypt. He is <a id="l3720"></a>by corruption of his name called Menes, Mines, Minæus, Mnevis, <a id="l3721"></a>Minies, Mineus, Enephes, Venephes, Phamenophis, Osimandes, Isman<a id="l3722"></a>des, Imandes, Memnon, Arminon.</p>
<p id="par336"> Amenophis  was succeeded by his son called by Herodotus <a id="l3724"></a>Rhampsinitus &amp; by others Ramses, Ramises, Rameses, Ramesses, <a id="l3725"></a>Ramestes, Rhampses, Remphis. Vpon an Obelisk erected by this king <a id="l3726"></a>in Heliopolis, &amp; sent to Rome by the Emperor Constantius, was an <a id="l3727"></a>inscription interpreted by Hermapion an Egyptian priest, expressing that <a id="l3728"></a>the king was long lived, &amp; reigned over a great part of the earth. And <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p070r"> &lt;70r&gt; </span> Strabo an eye witness tells us that in the monuments of the Kings of Egypt <a id="l3729"></a>above the Memnonium were inscriptions upon Obelisks expressing the <a id="l3730"></a>riches of the Kings &amp; their reigning as far as Scythia Bactrya India &amp; <a id="l3731"></a>Ionia. And Tacitus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n344-ref">[344]</sup> tells us from an inscription seen at Thebes by Cæsar <a id="l3732"></a>Germanicus &amp; interpreted to him by the Egyptian Priests that this King <a id="l3733"></a>Ramesses had an army of 700000 men, &amp; reigned over Libya, Ethi<a id="l3734"></a>opia, Media, Persia, Bactria, Scythia, Armenia, Cappadocia, Bithynia, <a id="l3735"></a>&amp; Lycia. Whence the  Monarchy of Assyria was not yet risen. <a id="l3736"></a>This King was very covetous, &amp; a great collector of Taxes, &amp; one of <a id="l3737"></a>the richest of all the Kings of Egypt, &amp; built the western portico of <a id="l3738"></a>the temple of Vulcan.</p>
<p id="par337">And Mœris inheriting the riches of Ramesses built the northern portico <a id="l3739"></a>of that temple more sumptuously, &amp; made the Lake of Mœris with two <a id="l3740"></a>great Pyramids of brick in the midst of it, And for preserving the division <a id="l3742"></a>of Egypt into equal shares amongst the soldiers, this king wrote a <a id="l3743"></a>book of surveying, which gave a beginning to Geometry. He is called <a id="l3744"></a>also Maris, Myris, Meres, Marres, Smarres; &amp; more corruptly (by <a id="l3745"></a>changing Μ into Α, Τ, Β, Σ, ΥΧ, Λ, &amp;c.) Ayres, Tyris, Byires, Soris, <a id="l3746"></a>Vchoreus, Lachares, Labaris, &amp;c.</p>
<p id="par338">Diodorus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n345-ref">[345]</sup> places Vchoreus between Osimandes &amp;  Myris, that is between <a id="l3747"></a>Amenophis &amp; Mœris &amp; saith that he built Memphys &amp; fortified it to admiration <a id="l3748"></a>with a mighty rampart of earth &amp; a broad &amp; deep trench which was filled with <a id="l3749"></a>the water of the Nile, &amp; made there a vast &amp; deep  Lake for receiving the wa<a id="l3750"></a>ter of the Nile in the time of its overflowing, &amp; built palaces in the city; <a id="l3751"></a>&amp; that this place was so commodiously seated that most of the Kings <a id="l3752"></a>who reigned after him preferred it before Thebes, &amp; removed the Court <a id="l3753"></a>from thence to this place, so that the magnificence of Thebes from <a id="l3754"></a>that time began to decrease &amp; that of Memphis to increase till <a id="l3755"></a>Alexander King of Macedon built Alexandria. These great works <a id="l3756"></a>of Vchoreus &amp; those of Mœris savour of one &amp; the same genius <a id="l3757"></a>&amp; were certainly done by one &amp; the same king distinguished into two <a id="l3758"></a>by a corruption of the name as above. For this Lake of Vchoreus  <a id="l3759"></a>was certainly the same with that of Mœris.</p>
<p id="par339">After the example of the two brick Pyramids made by Mœris, the <a id="l3760"></a>three next Kings, Cheops, Cephren &amp; Micerinus built the three great pyramids <a id="l3761"></a>at Memphis; &amp; therefore reigned in that city. Cheops shut up the temples <a id="l3762"></a>of the Nomes &amp; prohibited the worship of the Gods of Egypt, designing no <a id="l3763"></a>doubt to have been worshipped himself after death. He is called also <a id="l3764"></a>Chembis, Chemmis, Chemnes, Phiops, Apathus, Apappus, Suphis, Saophis, Siphoas, Siphaosis, Soiphis,  Siphuris, Anoiphis, Anoisis. He built the biggest of the three great <a id="l3766"></a>Pyramids which stand together, &amp; his brother Cephren or Cerpheres <a id="l3767"></a>built the second, &amp; his son Micerinus founded the third. This last <a id="l3768"></a>king was celebrated for clemency &amp; justice. He shut up the <a id="l3769"></a>dead body of his daughter in a hollow Ox &amp; caused her to be <a id="l3770"></a>worshipped daily with odours. He is called also Cheres, Cherinus, <a id="l3771"></a>Bicheres, Moscheres, Mencheres. He died before the third Pyramid <a id="l3772"></a>was finished &amp; his sister  &amp; successor Nitocris finished it.</p>
<p id="par340">Then reigned Asychis who built the eastern Portico of <a id="l3773"></a>the temple of Vulcan very splendidly, &amp; among the small Py<a id="l3774"></a>ramids a large Pyramid of brick made of mud dug out of the lake of <a id="l3775"></a>Mœris. And these are the Kings who reigned at Memphys &amp; spent <a id="l3776"></a>their time in adorning that city, until the Ethiopians &amp; the Assyrians &amp; others revolted &amp; Egypt lost all her domi<a id="l3777"></a>nion abroad, &amp; became again divided into several small kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par341">One of those Kingdoms was I think at Memphis <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span> under Gnephactus &amp; <a id="l3778"></a>his son &amp; successor Boccharis. Africanus calls Boccharis a Saite; but Sais at this time had other Kings. Gnephactus (otherwise called Neochabis) <a id="l3779"></a>&amp; Technatis) cursed Menes for his luxury, &amp; caused the curse to be entered <a id="l3780"></a>in the temple of Iupiter at Thebes &amp; therefore reigned over Thebais. And <a id="l3781"></a>Boccharis sent in a wild bull upon the God Mnevis which was worshipped <a id="l3782"></a>at Heliopolis. Another of those Kingdoms was at Anysis (or Hanes Isa XXX.4) <a id="l3783"></a>under its King Anysis or Amosis. A third was at Sais under Stephanates, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p071r"> &lt;71r&gt; </span> Nechepsos &amp; Nechus. And a fourth was at Tanis or Zoan under Pe<a id="l3784"></a>tubastes, Osorchon &amp; Psammis. And Egypt being weakened by this divi<a id="l3785"></a>sion, was invaded &amp; conquered by the Ethiopians under Sabacon, <a id="l3786"></a>who slew Bocchoris &amp; Nechus &amp; made Anysis fly. The Olympiads <a id="l3787"></a>began in the reign of Petubastes, &amp; the Æra of Nabonassar in the <a id="l3788"></a>22<sup>th</sup> year of the reign of Bocchoris according to Africanus. And there<a id="l3789"></a>fore the division of Egypt into many Kingdoms began before the <a id="l3790"></a>Olympiads, but not above the length of two Kings reigns before them.</p>
<p id="par342">After the study of Astronomy was set on foot for the use of <a id="l3791"></a>navigation, &amp; the Egyptians by the heliacal risings &amp; Settings of the <a id="l3792"></a>starrs had determined the length of the solar year of 365 days, &amp; by <a id="l3793"></a>other observations had fixed the Solstices &amp; formed the fixt starrs into <a id="l3794"></a>Asterisms (all which was done in the reign of Ammon, Sesac, Orus, &amp; <a id="l3795"></a>Memnon:) it may be presumed that they continued to observe the <a id="l3796"></a>motions of the Planets. For they called them after the names of their Gods, <a id="l3797"></a>&amp; Nechepsos or Nicepsos King of Sais, by the assistance of Petosiris a <a id="l3798"></a>priest of Egypt invented Astrology, grounding it upon the aspects of the <a id="l3799"></a>planets, &amp; the qualities of the men &amp; weomen to whom they were dedi<a id="l3800"></a>cated. And in the beginning of the reign of Nabonassar King of Babylon, <a id="l3801"></a>about which time the Ethiopians under Sabacus invaded Egypt, those Egypti<a id="l3802"></a>ans who fled from him to Babylon, carried thither the Egyptian year <a id="l3803"></a>of 365 days &amp; the study of Astronomy &amp; Astrology &amp; founded the Æra <a id="l3804"></a>of Nabonassar, dating it from the first year of that Kings reign, which was <a id="l3805"></a>the 22<sup>th</sup> year of Boccharis as above, &amp; beginning the year on the <a id="l3806"></a>same day with the Egyptians for the sake of their calculations. So Dio<a id="l3807"></a>dorus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n346-ref">[346]</sup>: <em class="underline">They say that the Chaldæans in Babylon, being colonies of Egyptians, <a id="l3808"></a>became famous for Astrology, having learnt it from the priests of Egypt</em>. <a id="l3809"></a>And so Estiæus, who wrote an history of Egypt, in speaking of a disaster <a id="l3810"></a>of the invaded Egyptians, said <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n347-ref">[347]</sup> that <em class="underline">the priests who survived this disaster, <a id="l3811"></a>taking the sacra of Iupiter Enyalius, came to Sennaar in Babylonia</em>. From the 15<sup>th</sup> year of Asa in which Zerah was beaten, &amp; Menes or Ameno<a id="l3812"></a>phis began his reign, to the beginning of the Æra of Nabonassar, were 200 <a id="l3813"></a>years; &amp; this interval of time allows room for about nine or ten reigns <a id="l3814"></a>of kings at about twenty years to a reign one with another. And so many <a id="l3815"></a>reigns there were according to the account set down above out of Herodotus, <a id="l3816"></a>&amp; therefore that account, as it is the oldest &amp; was received by Herodotus <a id="l3817"></a>from the priests of Thebes, Memphis, &amp; Heliopolis, three principal cities <a id="l3818"></a>of Egypt, so it agrees with the course of nature, &amp; leaves no room <a id="l3819"></a>for the reigns of the many nameless Kings which we have omitted. <a id="l3820"></a>These omitted Kings reigned before Mœris, &amp; by consequence at Thebes. <a id="l3821"></a>For Mœris translated the seat of the Empire from Thebes to Memphis. <a id="l3822"></a>They reigned after Ramesses. For Ramesses was the son &amp; successor <a id="l3823"></a>of Menes who reigned next after the Gods. Now Menes built the <a id="l3824"></a>body of the temple of Vulcan, Ramesses the  first portico, &amp; Mœris <a id="l3825"></a>the second portico thereof. But the Egyptians for making their Gods <a id="l3826"></a>&amp; kingdome look ancient, have inserted between the builders of the <a id="l3827"></a>first &amp; second portico of this temple, three hundred &amp; thirty Kings of <a id="l3828"></a>of Thebes, &amp; supposed that these kings reigned eleven thousand years, <a id="l3829"></a>as if any temple could stand so long. This being a manifest fiction <a id="l3830"></a>we have corrected it by omitting those interposed kings who did nothing, <a id="l3831"></a>&amp; placing Mœris the builder of the second portico, next after Ramesses <a id="l3832"></a>the builder of the first.</p>
<p id="par343">In the dynasties of Manetho, Sevechus is made the successor of <a id="l3833"></a>Sabacus, being his son; &amp; perhaps he is the Sethon of Herodotus who became <a id="l3834"></a>priest of Vulcan &amp; neglected military discipline. For Sabacus is that <a id="l3835"></a>So or Sua with whom Hoshea King of Israel conspired against the <a id="l3836"></a>Assyrians in the fourth year of Hezekiah, Anno Nabonass. 24. Herodotus <a id="l3837"></a>tells us twice or thrice that Sabacus after a long reign of fifty years <a id="l3838"></a>relinquished Egypt voluntarily, &amp; that Anysis who fled from him returned <a id="l3839"></a>&amp; reigned again in the lower Egypt after him, or rather with him: <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p072r"> &lt;72r&gt; </span> And that Sethon reigned after Sabacus, &amp; went to Pelusium against the <a id="l3840"></a>army of Sennacherib, &amp; was relieved with a great multitude of mise <a id="l3841"></a>which eat the bowstrings of the Assyrians: in memory of which the statue <a id="l3842"></a>of Sethon (seen by Herodotus) was made with a mouse in its hand. A Mouse <a id="l3843"></a>was the Egyptian symbol of destruction, &amp; the mouse in the hand of Sethon <a id="l3844"></a>signifies only that he overcame the Assyrians with a great destruction. <a id="l3845"></a>The scriptures inform us that when Sennacherib invaded Iudea &amp; <a id="l3846"></a>besieged Lachish &amp; Libnah (which was in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Hezekiah, Anno <a id="l3847"></a>Nabonass. 34,) the King of Iudah trusted upon Pharaoh King of Egypt, <a id="l3848"></a>that is upon Sethon, &amp; that Tirhakah King of Ethiopia came out also <a id="l3849"></a>to fight against Sennacherib<sup class="note" id="n348-ref">[348]</sup> (2 King XVIII.21. &amp; XIX.9:) which makes it <a id="l3850"></a>probable that when Sennacherib heard of the Kings of Egypt &amp; Ethio<a id="l3851"></a>pia coming against him, he went from Libnah towards Pelusium to <a id="l3852"></a>oppose them &amp; was there surprized &amp; set upon in the night by them <a id="l3853"></a>both, &amp; routed with as great a slaughter as if the bowstrings of the <a id="l3854"></a>Assyrians had been eaten by mise. Some think that the Assyrians <a id="l3855"></a>were smitten by lightning, or by a fiery wind which sometimes comes <a id="l3856"></a>from the southern parts of Chaldea. After this victory Tirhakah succeed<a id="l3857"></a>ing Sethon, carried his arms westward through Libya &amp; Afric to the <a id="l3858"></a>mouth of the straits. But Herodotus tells us that the Priests of Egypt <a id="l3859"></a>recconed Sethon the last King of Egypt who reigned before the divi<a id="l3860"></a>sion of Egypt into twelve contemporary Kingdoms, &amp; by consequence <a id="l3861"></a>before the invasion of Egypt by the Assyrians.</p>
<p id="par344">For Asserhadon King of Assyria in the 68<sup>th</sup> year of Nabon<a id="l3862"></a>assar, after he had reigned about thirty years over Assyria, invaded <a id="l3863"></a>the Kingdom of Babylon, &amp; then carried into captivity many people from <a id="l3864"></a>Babylon &amp; Cutha &amp; Ava &amp; Hamath &amp; Sepharvaim, placing them in the <a id="l3865"></a>regions of Samaria &amp; Damascus. And from thence they carried into <a id="l3866"></a>Babylonia &amp; Assyria the remainder of the people of Israel &amp; Syria which <a id="l3867"></a>had been left there by Tiglathpileser. This captivity was 65 years after <a id="l3868"></a>the first year of Ahaz (Isa. VII. 1,8 &amp; 2. King. XV. 37 &amp; XVI. 5) &amp; by con<a id="l3869"></a>sequence in the twentieth year of Manasseh, Anno Nabonass. 69. And <a id="l3870"></a>then Tartan was sent by Asserhadon with an army against Ashdod <a id="l3871"></a>or Azoth (a town at that time subject to Iudea (2 Chron. XXVI. 6) &amp; <a id="l3872"></a>took it, (Isa. XX. I. And this post being secured, the Assyrians beat <a id="l3873"></a>the Iews, &amp; captivated Manasses, &amp; subdued Iudea. And in these warrs, <a id="l3874"></a>Isaiah was sawn asunder by the command of Manasses for pro<a id="l3875"></a>phesying against him. Then the Assyrians invaded &amp; subdued Egypt &amp; Ethiopia <a id="l3876"></a>&amp; carried the Egyptians &amp; Ethiopians into captivity, &amp; thereby put an end <a id="l3877"></a>to the reign of the Ethiopians over Egypt, Isa. VII. 18, &amp; VIII. 7, &amp; X. 11, 12, &amp; <a id="l3878"></a>XIX. 23, &amp; XX. 4. In this warr the city No-Ammon or Thebes, which had <a id="l3879"></a>hitherto continued in a flourishing condition, was miserably wasted &amp; led <a id="l3880"></a>into captivity, as is described by Nahum, chap. III. v. 8, 9, 10. For Nahum wrote <a id="l3881"></a>after the last invasion of Iudæa by the Assyrians (chap. I. v. 15) &amp; therefore <a id="l3882"></a>describes this captivity as fresh in memory. And this &amp; other following <a id="l3883"></a>invasions of Egypt under Nebuchadnezzar &amp; Cambyses, put an end to <a id="l3884"></a>the glory of that city. Asserhadon reigned over the Egyptians &amp; Ethiopians <a id="l3885"></a>three years (Isa. XX. 3, 4,) that is until his death, which was in the year <a id="l3886"></a>of Nabonassar 81, &amp; therefore invaded Egypt &amp; put an end to the reign <a id="l3887"></a>of the Ethiopians over the Egyptians in the year of Nabonassar 78, so that <a id="l3888"></a>the Ethiopians under Sabacon &amp; his successors Sethon &amp; Tirhakah reigned <a id="l3889"></a>over Egypt about 80 years. Herodotus allots 50 years to Sabacon, &amp; Africa<a id="l3890"></a>nus  fourteen years to Sethon &amp; eighteen to Tirhakah.</p>
<p id="par345">The division of Egypt into more Kingdoms than one both before &amp; after <a id="l3891"></a>the reign of the Ethiopians, &amp; the conquest of the Egyptians by Asserhadon, the <a id="l3892"></a>prophet Isaiah <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n349-ref">[349]</sup> seems to allude unto in these words. <em class="underline">I will set</em>, saith he, <a id="l3893"></a><em class="underline">the Egyptians against the Egyptians, &amp; they shall fight every one  <a id="l3894"></a>against his neighbour, city against city, &amp; Kingdom against Kingdom, &amp; the <a id="l3895"></a>Spirit of Egypt shall fail</em>. — <em class="underline">And the Egyptians will I give over into <a id="l3896"></a>the hand of a cruel Lord</em> [viz<sup>t</sup> Asserhadon] <em class="underline">&amp;; a fierce King shall reign </em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p073r"> &lt;73r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">over them</em>. — <em class="underline">Surely the princes of Zoan</em> [Tanis] <em class="underline">are fools, <a id="l3897"></a>the counsel of the wise councellours of Pharaoh is become bruit<a id="l3898"></a>ish.

<p id="par346">After the death of Asserhadon, Egypt remained subject to twelve <a id="l3903"></a>contemporary Kings, who revolted from the Assyrians &amp; reigned together <a id="l3904"></a>fifteen years, including, I think the three years of Asserhadon, because <a id="l3905"></a>the Egyptians do not reccon him among their Kings. They <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n350-ref">[350]</sup> built the La<a id="l3906"></a>byrinth adjoyning to the Lake of Mœris, which was a very magnificent <a id="l3907"></a>structure with twelve Halls in it for their Palaces. And then Psamiticus, <a id="l3908"></a>who was one of the twelve, conquered all the rest. He built the last <a id="l3909"></a>portico of the temple of Vulcan founded by Menes about 260 years before, <a id="l3910"></a>&amp; reigned 54, years, including the fifteen years of his reign with the <a id="l3911"></a>twelve Kings: Then reigned Nechaoh or Nechus 17 years; Psammis <a id="l3912"></a>six years; Vaphres, Apries, Eraphius or Hophra 25 years; Amosis <a id="l3913"></a>44 years; &amp; Psammeniticus six months, according to Herodotus. Egypt <a id="l3914"></a>was subdued by Nebuchadnezzar in the last year but one of Hophra, <a id="l3915"></a>Anno Nabonass. 178, &amp; remained in subjection to Babylon forty years <a id="l3916"></a>(Ier  XLIV. 30, &amp; Ezek. XIX. 12, 13, 14, 17, 19) that is, almost all the reign <a id="l3917"></a>of Amosis, a plebeian set over Egypt by the conqueror. The forty years <a id="l3918"></a>ended with the death of Cyrus: for he reigned over Egypt &amp; Ethiopia accor<a id="l3919"></a>ding to Xenophon. At that time therefore those nations recovered their <a id="l3920"></a>liberty: but after four or five years more they were invaded &amp; con<a id="l3921"></a>quered by Cambyses, Anno Nabonass 223 or 224, &amp; have almost ever <a id="l3922"></a>since remained in servitude, as was predicted by the prophets.</p>

And so <a id="l3924"></a>many years there were from the 78<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonassar in which the domi<a id="l3925"></a>nion of the Ethiopians over Egypt came to an end, unto the 224<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l3926"></a>Nabonassar in which Cambyses invaded Egypt &amp; put an end to that Kingdom. <a id="l3927"></a>Which is an argument that Herodotus was circumspect &amp; faithful in <a id="l3928"></a>his narrations, &amp; has given us a good  account of the antiquities of <a id="l3929"></a>Egypt so far as the Priests of Egypt at Thebes Memphis &amp; Heliopolis, &amp; <a id="l3930"></a>the Carians &amp; Ionians inhabiting Egypt were then able to inform him. For <a id="l3931"></a>he consulted them all: &amp; the Cares &amp; Ionians had been in Egypt from the <a id="l3932"></a>time of the reign of the twelve contemporary Kings.</p>
<p id="par348">Pliny tells us that the Egyptian Obelisks were of a sort of stone <a id="l3933"></a>dug neare Syene in Thebais, &amp; that the first Obelisk was made by Mitres <a id="l3934"></a>who reigned in Heliopolis, (that is, by Mephres the predecessor of Mis<a id="l3935"></a>phragmuthosis,) &amp; that afterwards other Kings made others: Sachis <a id="l3936"></a>(that is, Sesachis or Sesac) four, each of 48 cubits in length; Ramises <a id="l3937"></a>(i.e. Ramesses) two; Smarres (that is, Mœris) one of 48 cubits in <a id="l3938"></a>length; Eraphius (or Hophra) one of 48; &amp; Nectabis (or Necten abis) <a id="l3939"></a>one of 80. Mephres therefore extended his dominion over all the upper <a id="l3940"></a>Egypt from Syene to Heliopolis, &amp; after him &amp; Amosis reigned Ammon &amp; Sesac who <a id="l3941"></a>erected the first great Empire in the world. And these four, Amosis, Ammon, <a id="l3942"></a>Sesac &amp; Orus reigned in the four ages of the great Gods of Egypt: &amp; Ame<a id="l3943"></a>nophis was the Menes who reigned next after them. He was succeeded <a id="l3944"></a>by Ramesses &amp; Mœris &amp; sometime after by Hophra.</p>
<p id="par349">Diodorus recites the same Kings of Egypt with Herodotus, but in <a id="l3945"></a>a more confused order, &amp; repeats some of them twice or oftener under <a id="l3946"></a>various names, &amp; omits others. His Kings are these. Iupiter (Ammon) &amp; <a id="l3947"></a>Iuno, Osiris &amp; Isis, Horus, Menes, Busiris I, Busiris II, Osymanduas, <a id="l3948"></a>Vchoreus, Myris, Sesoosis I, Sesoosis II, Amasis, Actisanes, Mendes or <a id="l3949"></a>Marrus, Proteus, Remphis, Chembis, Cephren, Mycerinus or Cherinus, <a id="l3950"></a>Gnephacthus, Bocchoris, Sabachus, twelve contemporary Kings, Psammitichus, <a id="l3951"></a>* * Vapheres, Amasis. Here I take Sesoosis I &amp; Sesoosis II, Busiris I <a id="l3952"></a>&amp; Busiris II to be the same kings with Osiris &amp; Orus. Also Osimanduas <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p074r"> &lt;74r&gt; </span> to be the same with Amenophis or Menes. Also Amasis &amp; Actisanes <a id="l3953"></a>an Ethiopian who conquered him, to be the same with Anysis &amp; Sa<a id="l3954"></a>bacus in Herodotus. And Vchoreus, Mendes, Marrus &amp; Myris to be only <a id="l3955"></a>several names of one &amp; the same King. Whence the catalogue of Diodorus <a id="l3956"></a>will be reduced to this. Iupiter (Ammon) &amp; Iuno; Osiris, Busiris or Se<a id="l3957"></a>sosis, &amp; Isis; Horus or Busiris II or Sesoosis II; Menes or Osimanduas; <a id="l3958"></a>Proteus; Remphis or Ramesses; Vchoreus, Mendes, Marrhus or Myris; <a id="l3959"></a>Chembis or Cheops; Cephren; Mycerinus; * * Gnephactus; Boccharis; <a id="l3960"></a>Amasis or Anysis; Actisanes or Sabacus; * twelve contemporary <a id="l3961"></a>kings; Psammitichus; * * Vaphres; Amasis. To which, if in their <a id="l3962"></a>proper places you add Nitocris, Asychis, Sethon, Nechus, &amp; Psammis, <a id="l3963"></a>you will have the catalogue of Herodotus.</p>
<p id="par350">The Dynasties of Manetho &amp; Eratosthenes seem to be filled with <a id="l3964"></a>many such names of Kings as Herodotus omitted. When it shall be made <a id="l3965"></a>appear that any of them reigned in Egypt after the expulsion of the <a id="l3966"></a>shepherds, &amp; were different from the Kings described above: they may <a id="l3967"></a>be inserted in their proper places.</p>
<p id="par351">Egypt was conquered by the Ethiopians under Sabacon, about <a id="l3968"></a>the beginning of the Æva of Nabonassar, or perhaps three or four <a id="l3969"></a>years before, that is, about three hundred years before Herodotus <a id="l3970"></a>wrote &gt;his history. And about eighty years after that conquest, it was <a id="l3971"></a>conquered again by the Assyrians under Asserhadon. And the <a id="l3972"></a>history of Egypt set down by Herodotus from the time of this last <a id="l3973"></a>conquest, is right both as to the number &amp; order &amp; names of the <a id="l3974"></a>kings, &amp; as to the length of their reignes. And therein he is now followed <a id="l3975"></a>by historians, being the only author who hath given us so good a history of <a id="l3976"></a>Egypt for that interval of time. And if his history of the earlier times be less <a id="l3977"></a>accurate, it was because the Archives of Egypt had suffered much during the <a id="l3978"></a>reign of the Ethiopians &amp; Assyrians. And it is not likely that the riests <a id="l3979"></a>of Egypt who lived two or three hundred years after the days of Hero<a id="l3980"></a>dotus, could mend the matter. On the contrary after Cambyses had carryed <a id="l3981"></a>away the records of Egypt, the priests were daily feigning new Kings <a id="l3982"></a>to make their Gods &amp; nation look ancient, as is manifest <a id="l3983"></a>by comparing Herodotus with Diodorus Siculus, &amp; both of them with <a id="l3984"></a>what Plato relates out of the Poem of Solon : which Poem makes the <a id="l3985"></a>warrs of the great Gods of Egypt against the Greeks to have been in <a id="l3986"></a>the age of Cecrops, Erechtheus &amp; Erechthonius, &amp; a little before those <a id="l3987"></a>of Theseus; these Gods at that time instituting temples &amp; sacred rites <a id="l3988"></a>to themselves. And therefore I have chosen to rely upon the stories re<a id="l3989"></a>lated to Herodotus by the priests of Egypt in those days &amp; corrected by <a id="l3990"></a>the poem of Solon so as to make these Gods of Egypt no older than Cecrops <a id="l3991"></a>&amp; Erechtheus, &amp; their successor Menes no older than Theseus &amp; Memnon, &amp; the temple of Vulcan not above 280 years in building: then to <a id="l3992"></a>correct Herodotus by Manetho, Eratosthenes, Diodorus &amp; others who <a id="l3993"></a>lived after the Priests of Egypt had corrupted their antiquities much <a id="l3994"></a>more than they had done in the days of Herodotus.</p>

<p id="par352">As the Gods or ancient deified Kings &amp; Princes of Greece ~ <a id="l3996"></a>Egypt &amp; Syria of Damascus have been made much ancienter than the <a id="l3997"></a>truth, so have those of Chaldea &amp; Assyria. For Diodorus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n351-ref">[351]</sup> tells us ~ <a id="l3998"></a>that when Alexander the great was in Asia, the Chaldeans recconed <a id="l3999"></a>473000 years since they first began to observe the starrs. And Ctesias <a id="l4000"></a>&amp; the ancient Greek &amp; Latin writers who copy from him have made <a id="l4001"></a>the Assyrian Empire as old as Noah's flood within 60 or 70 years <a id="l4002"></a>&amp; tell us the names of all the kings of Assyria downwards from Belus <a id="l4003"></a>&amp; his feigned son Ninus to Sardanapalus the last king of that Monarchy. But the names of his Kings except two or three have no affinity with <a id="l4004"></a>the names of the Assyrians mentioned in Scripture. For the Assyrians <a id="l4005"></a>were usually named after their Gods,  Bel or Pul; Chaddon Hadden <a id="l4006"></a>Adon or Adonis; Melech or Moloch; Atsur or Assur; Nebo; Nergal; <a id="l4007"></a>Merodach: as in these names, Pul, Tiglath-Pul-Assur, Salmon-Asser, <a id="l4008"></a>Adra-Melech, Shar-Asser, Asser-Hadden, Sardanapalus or Asser-Hadon<a id="l4009"></a>Pul, Nabonasser or Nabo-Adon-Asser, Bel Adan, Chiniladon or ~ <a id="l4010"></a>Chen-El-Adon, Nabo-Pul-Asser, Nebu-Chaddon-Asser, Nebuzaradon <a id="l4011"></a>or  Nebo-Asser-Adon, Nergal-Asser, Nergal-Shar-Asser, <a id="l4012"></a>Labo-Asser-dach, Sheseb-Asser, Beltes-Asser, Evil-Merodach, ~ <a id="l4013"></a>Shamgar-Nebo, Rabsaris or Rab-Asser, Nebus-Shashban, Mardocempad <a id="l4014"></a>or Merodach-Empad. Such were the Assyrian names; but those in <a id="l4015"></a>Ctesias are of another sort, except  Sardanapalus whose <a id="l4016"></a>name he had met with in Herodotus. He makes Semiramis as old <a id="l4017"></a>as the first Belus; but Herodotus tells us that she was but five gene<a id="l4018"></a>rations older than the mother of Labynitus. He represents that the <a id="l4019"></a>City Ninus was founded by a man of the same name, &amp; Babylon <a id="l4020"></a>by Semiramis : whereas either Nimrod or Asser founded those &amp; <a id="l4021"></a>other cities without giving his own name to  any of them. <a id="l4022"></a>He makes the Assyrian Empire continue about 1360 years, whereas <a id="l4023"></a>Herodotus tells us that it lasted only 500 years, &amp; the numbers <a id="l4024"></a>of Herodotus concerning those ancient times, are all of them too long. <a id="l4025"></a>He makes Nineveh destroyed by the Medes &amp; Babylonians, three hundred <a id="l4026"></a>years before the reign of Astibares &amp; Nebuchadnezzar who destroyed <a id="l4027"></a>it, &amp; sets down the  names of seven or eight feigned kings of <a id="l4028"></a>Media between the destruction of Nineveh &amp; the reigns of Astibares &amp; Nebuchadnezzar, as if the Empire of the Medes erected upon the <a id="l4029"></a>ruins of the Assyrian Empire had lasted 300 years, whereas it lasted <a id="l4030"></a>but 72. And the true Empire of the Assyrians described in scripture, <a id="l4031"></a>whose Kings were Pul, Tiglathpillaser, Salmonasser, Sennacherib, Asser<a id="l4032"></a>hadon, &amp;c, he mentions not, tho much nearer to his own times: which <a id="l4033"></a>shews that he was ignorant of the antiquities of the Assyrians. Yet some<a id="l4034"></a>thing of truth there is in the bottom of some of his stories, as there uses <a id="l4035"></a>to be in Romances: as that Nineveh was destroyed by the Medes &amp; Baby<a id="l4036"></a>lonians, that Sardanapalus was the last King of the Assyrian Empire, <a id="l4037"></a>&amp; that Astibares &amp; Astyages were Kings of the Medes. But he has <a id="l4038"></a>made all things too ancient, &amp; out of vain glory taken too great a liberty <a id="l4039"></a>in feigning names &amp; stories to please his reader.</p>
<p id="par353"><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p076r"> &lt;76r&gt; </span> When the Iews were newly returned from the Babylonian captivity, <a id="l4040"></a>they confessed their sins in this manner. Now therefore our God, – – – – <em class="underline">let <a id="l4041"></a>not all the trouble seem little before thee that hath come upon us, on <a id="l4042"></a>our Kings, on our princes, on our Priests, &amp; on our Prophets, &amp; on our <a id="l4043"></a>fathers, &amp; on all thy people, since the time of the Kings of Assyria,  <a id="l4044"></a>unto this day</em>, (Nehem. IX. 32.) that is, since the time of the Kingdom <a id="l4045"></a>of Assyria, or since the rise of that Empire. And therefore the <a id="l4046"></a>Assyrian Empire arose when the Kings of Assyria began to afflict <a id="l4047"></a>the inhabitants of Palestine: which was in the days of Pul. He &amp; <a id="l4048"></a>his successors afflicted Israel &amp; conquered the nations round about <a id="l4049"></a>them; &amp; upon the ruin of many small &amp; ancient Kingdoms erected <a id="l4050"></a>their Empire, conquering the Medes as well as other nations. But of <a id="l4051"></a>these conquests Ctesias knew not a word , no not so much as the <a id="l4052"></a>names of the conquerors, or that there was an Assyrian Empire <a id="l4053"></a>then standing For he supposes that the Medes reigned at that time, <a id="l4054"></a>&amp; that the Assyrian Empire was at an end above 250 years before it <a id="l4055"></a>began.</p>
<p id="par354">However we must allow that Nimrod founded a Kingdom at <a id="l4056"></a>Babylon, &amp; perhaps extended it into Assyria. But this Kingdom was <a id="l4057"></a>but of small extent if compared with the empires which rose up ~ afterwards being only within the fertile plains of Chaldea, Chalonitis &amp; Assyria watered by the Tigris &amp; Euphrates. And if it had been greater yet it was but of short con<a id="l4058"></a>tinuance, it being the custome in those early ages for every father <a id="l4059"></a>to divide his territories amongst his sons. So Noah was King of <a id="l4060"></a>all the world, &amp; Cham was King of all Afric, &amp; Iaphet of all Europe <a id="l4061"></a>&amp; Asia minor, but they left no standing Kingdoms. After the days <a id="l4062"></a>of Nimrod we hear no more of an Assyrian Empire till the days <a id="l4063"></a>of Pul. The four kings who in the days of Abraham invaded <a id="l4064"></a>the southern coast of Canaan came from the countries where <a id="l4065"></a>Nimrod had reigned, &amp; perhaps were some of his posterity who <a id="l4066"></a>had shared his conquests. In the time of the Iudges of Israel <a id="l4067"></a>Mesopotamia was under its own King, Iud. III. 8. And the King <a id="l4068"></a>of Zoba reigned on both sides of the river Euphrates till David <a id="l4069"></a>conquered him, 2 Sam. VIII, &amp; X. The Kingdoms of Israel, Moab, <a id="l4070"></a>Ammon, Edom, Philistia, Zidon, Damascus, &amp; Hamath the great, <a id="l4071"></a>continued subject to other lords than the Assyrians till the days <a id="l4072"></a>of Pul &amp; his successors, &amp; so did the house of Eden,( Amos I. 5. 2 King. <a id="l4073"></a>XIX. 12) &amp; Haran <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>o<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>r Carrhæ, (Gen.

XVII. 31. <span class="hspac-n" title="2 words space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sesac &amp; Memnon were great conquerors &amp; reigned <a id="l4076"></a>over Chaldea, Assyria, &amp; Persia, but in their histories there's not a word <a id="l4077"></a>of any opposition made to them by an Assyrian Empire then <a id="l4078"></a>standing. On the contrary Susiana, Media, Persia, Bactria Armenia <a id="l4079"></a>Cappadocia &amp;c were conquered by them &amp; continued subject to <a id="l4080"></a>the Kings of Egypt till after the long reign of Ramesses the son <a id="l4081"></a>of Memnon as above. Homer mentions Bacchus &amp; Memnon Kings <a id="l4082"></a>of Egypt &amp; Persia, but knew nothing of an Assyrian Empire. <a id="l4083"></a>Ionah prophesied when Israel was in affliction under the King of <a id="l4084"></a>Syria, &amp; this was in the latter part of the reign of Iehoahaz &amp; <a id="l4085"></a>first part of the reign of Ioas Kings of Israel, &amp; I think in the <a id="l4086"></a>reign of Mœris the successor of Ramesses King of Egypt &amp; about <a id="l4087"></a>sixty years before the reign of Pul. And Nineveh was then a city <a id="l4088"></a>of large extent, but full of Pastures for cattle so that it contained <a id="l4089"></a>but about 120000 persons. It was not yet grown so great &amp; potent <a id="l4090"></a>as not to be terrified at the preaching of Ionah, &amp; to fear being invaded <a id="l4091"></a>by its neighbours &amp; ruined within forty days. It had some time before got free <a id="l4092"></a>from the dominion of Egypt, &amp; had got a king of its own; but its king <a id="l4093"></a>was not yet called King of Assyria but only King of Nineveh, Ionah III. 6,7. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p077r"> &lt;77r&gt; </span> &amp; his Proclamation for a fast was not published in several nations <a id="l4094"></a>nor in all Assyria, but only in Nineveh &amp; perhaps in the villages thereof. <a id="l4095"></a>But soon after, when the dominion of Nineveh was established at <a id="l4096"></a>home, &amp; exalted over all Assyria properly so called, &amp; this kingdom <a id="l4097"></a>began to make war upon the neighbouring nations, its Kings were <a id="l4098"></a>no longer called Kings of Nineveh but began to be called Kings of <a id="l4099"></a>Assyria.</p>
<p id="par355">Amos prophesied in the reign of Ieroboam the son of Ioas King <a id="l4100"></a>of Israel soon after Ieroboam had subdued the Kingdoms of Damascus <a id="l4101"></a>&amp; Hamath, that is, about ten or twenty years before the reign of Pul: &amp; <a id="l4102"></a>he <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n352-ref">[352]</sup> thus reproves Israel for being lifted up by those conquests. <em class="underline">Ye <a id="l4103"></a>which rejoyce in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken <a id="l4104"></a>to us horns by our strength? Behold I will raise up against you <a id="l4105"></a>a nation, o house of Israel, saith the Lord, &amp; they shall afflict you <a id="l4106"></a>from the entring in of Hamath unto the river of the wilderness</em>. God here threatens to raise up a nation against Israel; but what <a id="l4107"></a>nation he names not. That he conceals till the Assyrians should <a id="l4108"></a>appear &amp; discover it. In the prophesies of Isaiah, Ieremiah, Eze<a id="l4109"></a>kiel, Hoseah, Micah, Nahum, Zephany &amp; Zechary, which were <a id="l4110"></a>written after the Monarchy grew up, its openly named upon all <a id="l4111"></a>occasions : but in this of Amos not once tho the captivity of Israel <a id="l4112"></a>&amp; Syria be the subject of the prophesy, &amp; that of Israel be often ~ <a id="l4113"></a>threatned. He only saith in general that Syria should go into capti<a id="l4114"></a>vity unto Kir, &amp; that Israel notwithstanding her present greatness <a id="l4115"></a>should go into captivity beyond Damascus; &amp; that God would raise <a id="l4116"></a>up a nation to afflict them: meaning that he would raise up above <a id="l4117"></a>them from a lower condition a nation whom they yet feared not. <a id="l4118"></a>For so the Hebrew word  מקם signifies when <a id="l4119"></a>applied to men, as in Amos V. 2. 1 Sam. XII. II. Psal. CXIII. 7. Ier. X. 20. <a id="l4120"></a>&amp; L. 32. Hab. I. 6. Zech. XI. 16. Amos  names the Assyrians <a id="l4121"></a>at once. At the writing of this prophesy they made no great <a id="l4122"></a>figure in the world, but were to be raised up against Israel, &amp; <a id="l4123"></a>by consequence rose up in the days of Pul &amp; his successors. For after <a id="l4124"></a>Ieroboam had conquered Damascus &amp; Hamath, his successor Mena<a id="l4125"></a>hem destroyed Tiphsah with its territories upon Euphrates, because <a id="l4126"></a>they opened not to him. And therefore Israel continued in its great<a id="l4127"></a>nes till Pul (probably grown formidable by some victories) caused <a id="l4128"></a>Menahem to buy his peace. Pul therefore reigning presently after <a id="l4129"></a>the prophesy of Amos, &amp; being the first upon record who began <a id="l4130"></a>to fulfill it, may be justly recconed the first conqueror &amp; founder <a id="l4131"></a>of this Empire. For <em class="underline">God stirred up the spirit of Pul &amp; the spirit of <a id="l4132"></a>Tiglathpileser King of Assyria</em>, 1 Chron. V. 20.</p>
<p id="par356">The same prophet Amos in prophesying against Israel, threatned them <a id="l4133"></a>in this manner with what had lately befallen other kingdoms. <em class="underline">Pass ye</em>, <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n353-ref">[353]</sup> saith <a id="l4134"></a>he, <em class="underline">to Calneh &amp; see, &amp; from thence go down to Hamath the great, then go <a id="l4135"></a>down to Gath of the Philistims. Be they better then these kingdoms</em>. These <a id="l4136"></a>kingdoms were not yet conquered by the Assyrians except that of Calneh <a id="l4137"></a>or Chalonitis upon Tigris between Babylon &amp; Nineveh. Gath was newly <a id="l4138"></a>vanquished <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n354-ref">[354]</sup> by Vzziah King of Iudah, &amp; Hamath <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n355-ref">[355]</sup> by Ieroboam King <a id="l4139"></a>of Israel. And while the prophet in threatning Israel with the Assy<a id="l4140"></a>rians, instances in desolations made by other nations, &amp; mentions no <a id="l4141"></a>other conquest of the Assyrians then that of Chalonitis neare Nineveh; <a id="l4142"></a>it argues that the King of Nineveh was now beginning his conquests, <a id="l4143"></a>&amp; had not yet made any great progress in that vast career of vic<a id="l4144"></a>tories which we read of a few years after.</p>
<p id="par357">For about seven years after the captivity of the ten tribes, when <a id="l4145"></a>Sennacherib warred in Syria which was in the 16<sup>th</sup> Olympiad) he <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n356-ref">[356]</sup> sent <a id="l4146"></a>this message to the King of Iudah. <em class="underline">Behold thou hast heard what the <a id="l4147"></a>kings of Assyria have done to all nations by destroying them utterly, <a id="l4148"></a>&amp; shalt thou be delivered? Have the Gods of the nations delivered</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p078r"> &lt;78r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">whom the Gods of my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan &amp; Haran &amp; Reseph <a id="l4149"></a>&amp; the children of Eden which were in</em> [the Kingdom of] <em class="underline">Thelassar? <a id="l4150"></a>Where is the King of Hamath, &amp; the King of Arpad, &amp; the King of the city <a id="l4151"></a>of Sepharvaim &amp; of Henah &amp; Ivah</em>? <span class="hspac-n" title="1 word space left blank.">&nbsp;</span> And Isaiah <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n357-ref">[357]</sup> thus introduceth the <a id="l4152"></a>King of Assyria boasting. <em class="underline">Are not my princes altogether as Kings? Is <a id="l4153"></a>not Calno</em> [or Calneh] <em class="underline">as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is <a id="l4154"></a>not Samaria as Damascus? As my hand hath found the Kingdoms of the <a id="l4155"></a>Idols, &amp; whose graven images did excell them of Ierusalem &amp; of Sa<a id="l4156"></a>maria, shall not I as I have done unto</em>  <em class="underline">Samaria &amp; her idols <a id="l4157"></a>so do to Ierusalem &amp; her Idols</em>? All this desolation is recited as fresh <a id="l4158"></a>in memory to terrify the Iews, &amp; these Kingdoms reach to the borders of <a id="l4159"></a>Assyria, &amp; to shew the largeness of the conquests they are called <a id="l4160"></a>all lands, that is, all round about Assyria. It was the custome of the <a id="l4161"></a>Kings of Assyria, for preventing the rebellion of people newly conquered, <a id="l4162"></a>to captivate &amp; transplant those of several countries into one anothers <a id="l4163"></a>lands &amp; intermix them variously. And thence it appears <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n358-ref">[358]</sup> that Halah <a id="l4164"></a>&amp; Habor &amp; Hara &amp; Gozan &amp; the cities of the Medes into which Galile <a id="l4165"></a>&amp; Samaria were transplanted, &amp; Kir into which Damascus was trans<a id="l4166"></a>planted, &amp; Babylon &amp; Cuth or the Susanchites &amp; Hamath &amp; Ava &amp; Se<a id="l4167"></a>pharvaim &amp; the Dinaites &amp; the Apharsathchites &amp; the Tarpelites <a id="l4168"></a>&amp; the Archevites &amp; the Dehavites &amp; the Elamites or Persians, part of <a id="l4169"></a>all which nations were led captive by Asserhadon &amp; his predecessors <a id="l4170"></a>into Samaria, were all of them conquered by the Assyrians not long <a id="l4171"></a>before.</p>
<p id="par358">In these conquests are involved on the west &amp; south side of Assyria <a id="l4172"></a>the kingdoms of Mesopotamia whose royal seats were Haran or Carrhæ, <a id="l4173"></a>&amp; Carchemish or Circutium, &amp; Sepharvaim a city upon Euphrates be<a id="l4174"></a>tween Babylon &amp; Nineveh called Sipparæ by Berosus Abydenus and <a id="l4175"></a>Polyhistor, &amp; Sipphara by Ptolomy, &amp; the kingdoms of Syria seated at <a id="l4176"></a>Samaria, Damascus, Gath, Hamath, Arpad, &amp; Rezeph a city placed by <a id="l4177"></a>Ptolomy neare Thapsacus. On the south side &amp; south east side were <a id="l4178"></a>Babylon &amp; Calneh or Calno a city which was founded by Nimrod where <a id="l4179"></a>Bagdad now stands, &amp; gave the name of Chalonitis to a large region <a id="l4180"></a>under its government; &amp; Thelassar or Talatha a city of the children <a id="l4181"></a>of Eden placed by Ptolomy in Babylonia upon the common stream of <a id="l4182"></a>Tigris &amp; Euphrates, which was therefore the river of Paradise; &amp; the <a id="l4183"></a>Archevites at Areca or Erech a city built by Nimrod on the east <a id="l4184"></a>side of Pasitigris between Apamia &amp; the Persian gulph; &amp; the Susan<a id="l4185"></a>chites at Cuth or Susa the Metropolis of Susiana. On the east were <a id="l4186"></a>Elymais &amp; some cities of the Medes, &amp; Kir <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n359-ref">[359]</sup> a city &amp; large region of Me<a id="l4187"></a>dia between Elymais &amp; Assyria called <sup class="note" id="n360-ref">[360]</sup> Kirene by the Chalde Para<a id="l4188"></a>phrast &amp; Latine interpreter &amp; Carine by Ptolomy. On the north east <a id="l4189"></a>were Habor or Chaboras a mountanous region between Assyria &amp; <a id="l4190"></a>Media; &amp; the Apharsachites or men of Arrapachitis a region <a id="l4191"></a>originally peopled by Arphaxad &amp; placed by Ptolomy at the bottom <a id="l4192"></a>of the mountain next Assyria. <span class="hspac-n" title="1 character space left blank.">&nbsp;</span> And on the north between Assyria <a id="l4193"></a>&amp; the Gordiæan mountains was Halah or Chalach the metropolis <a id="l4194"></a>of Calachene. And beyond these upon the Caspian sea was Gozan <a id="l4195"></a>called Gauzania by Ptolomy. <span class="hspac-n" title="1 character space left blank.">&nbsp;</span> Thus did these new conquests extend <a id="l4196"></a>every way from the province of Assyria to considerable distances <a id="l4197"></a>&amp; make up the great body of that Monarchy: so that well might the <a id="l4198"></a>King of Assyria boast how his armies had destroyed all lands. All these <a id="l4199"></a>nations <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n361-ref">[361]</sup> had till now their several Gods, &amp; each accounted his God <a id="l4200"></a>the God of his own land &amp; the defender thereof against the Gods of the <a id="l4201"></a>neighbouring countries, &amp; particularly against the Gods of Assyria; &amp; <a id="l4202"></a>therefore they were never till now united under the Assyrian <a id="l4203"></a>Monarchy, especially since the King of Assyria doth not boast of their <a id="l4204"></a>being conquered by the Assyrians oftner than once. But these being <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p079r"> &lt;79r&gt; </span> small Kingdoms the King of Assyria easily overflowed them. <em class="underline">Know <a id="l4205"></a>ye not, saith <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n362-ref">[362]</sup> Sennacherib to the Iews, what I &amp; my fathers have done <a id="l4206"></a>unto all the people of other lands? — For no God of any nation or king<a id="l4207"></a>dom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, &amp; out of the hand <a id="l4208"></a>of my fathers: how then shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</em> <a id="l4209"></a>He &amp; his fathers therefore, Pul, Tiglathpilezer, &amp; Salmonasser were <a id="l4210"></a>great conquerors, &amp; with a current of victories had newly overflow<a id="l4211"></a>ed all nations round about Assyria, &amp; thereby set up this Monarchy.</p>
<p id="par359">Between the reigns of Ieroboam II &amp; his son Zecharias there was <a id="l4212"></a>an interregnum of about ten or twelve years in the kingdom of Israel. <a id="l4213"></a>And the prophet Hosea <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n363-ref">[363]</sup> in the time of that interregnum or soon after, <a id="l4214"></a>mentions the King of Assyria by the name of Iareb &amp; another conqueror <a id="l4215"></a>by the name of Salman. And perhaps Salman might be the first part <a id="l4216"></a>of the name of Salmanasser, &amp; Iareb, or Irib (for it may be read <a id="l4217"></a>both ways,) the last part of the name of his successor Sennacherib. But <a id="l4218"></a>whoever these Princes were, it appears not that they reigned before <a id="l4219"></a>Salmanasser. Pul, or Belus seems to be the first who carried on <a id="l4220"></a>his conquests beyond the Province of Assyria. He conquered Calneh <a id="l4221"></a>with its territories in the reign of Ierboam (Amos I. 1, &amp; VI. 2, &amp; Isa. <a id="l4222"></a>X. 8,9) &amp; invaded Israel in the reign of Menahem (2 King. XV. 19) but <a id="l4223"></a>stayed not in the land, being bought off by Menahem for a thousand <a id="l4224"></a>talents of silver. In his reign therefore the Kingdom of Assyria was <a id="l4225"></a>advanced on this side Tigris.

<p id="par360">Herodotus tells us that one of the gates of Babylon was <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n364-ref">[364]</sup> called <a id="l4228"></a>the gate of Semiramis, &amp; that she adorned the walls of the city &amp; the <a id="l4229"></a>Temple of Belus, &amp; that she <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n365-ref">[365]</sup> was five generations older than Nitocris <a id="l4230"></a>the mother of Labynitus or Nabonnedus the last King of Babylon, &amp; <a id="l4231"></a>there  fore she flourished four generations or about 134 years <a id="l4232"></a>before Nebuchadnezzar &amp; by consequence in the reign of Tiglath<a id="l4233"></a>pileser the successor of Pul. And the followers of Ctesias tell us <a id="l4234"></a>that she built Babylon &amp; was the widow of the son &amp; successor of <a id="l4235"></a>Belus the founder of the Assyrian Empire, that is, the widow of <a id="l4236"></a>one of the sons of Pul. But <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n366-ref">[366]</sup> Berosus a Chaldæan blames the Greeks <a id="l4237"></a>for ascribing the building of Babylon to Semiramis : &amp; other authors <a id="l4238"></a>ascribe the building of this city to Belus himself, that is to Pul. <a id="l4239"></a>So Curtius <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n367-ref">[367]</sup> tells us: <em class="underline">Semiramis Babylonem condiderat, vel ut <a id="l4240"></a>plerique credidere Belus, cujus regia ostenditur</em>.

<p id="par361">that is <a id="l4249"></a>by the Syrian or Assyrian Belus, the words Tyrian, Syrian &amp; Assyrian <a id="l4250"></a>being anciently used promiscuously for one another. Herennius <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n370-ref">[370]</sup> <a id="l4251"></a>tells us that it was built by the son of Belus; &amp; this son might be ~ <a id="l4252"></a>Nabonassar.

For all the Kings of Babylon in the Canon of Ptolemy <a id="l4255"></a>are called Assyrians &amp; Nabonassar is the first of them.

<p id="par362">Pul therefore was succeeded at Nineveh by his elder son Tiglathpileser at the same time that he left Babylon to his younger son  <a id="l4269"></a>Nabonassar.

<p id="par363">Salmaneser (called Enemessar by Tobit Chap. 1) invaded <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n373-ref">[373]</sup> all <a id="l4284"></a>Phenicia, took the city of Samaria, &amp; captivated Israel &amp; placed them in <a id="l4285"></a>Chalach &amp; Chabor by the river Gozan, &amp; in the cities of the Medes.

<p id="par364">Sennacherib the son of Salmaneser in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Heze<a id="l4289"></a>kiah invaded Phœnicia &amp; took several cities of Iudah &amp; attempted <a id="l4290"></a>Egypt; &amp; Sethon or Sevechus King of Egypt &amp; Tirhakah King of Ethi<a id="l4291"></a>opia coming against him, he lost in one night 185000 men, as some <a id="l4292"></a>say by a plague, or perhaps by lightning, or a fiery wind which blows <a id="l4293"></a>sometimes in the neighbouring deserts, or rather by being surprised <a id="l4294"></a>by Sethon &amp; Tirhakah. For the Egyptians in memory of this action <a id="l4295"></a>erected a statue to Sethon holding in his hand a mouse the Egyptian sym<a id="l4296"></a>bol of destruction. Vpon this defeat Sennacherib returned in hast <a id="l4297"></a>to Nineveh &amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n375-ref">[375]</sup> his Kingdom became troubled so that Tobit could not go <a id="l4298"></a>into Media, the Medes I think at this time revolting. And he was soon <a id="l4299"></a>after slain by two of his sons who fled into Armenia, &amp; his son Asser<a id="l4300"></a>hadon succeeded him. At that time did Merodach Baladan or <a id="l4301"></a>Mardocempad King of Babylon send an embassy to Hezekiah King of Iudah.</p>
<p id="par365">Asserhadon called Sarchedon by Tobit (ch.1. 21) &amp; Assardin by the <a id="l4302"></a>seventy, began his reign  at Nineveh, in the year of Nabonassar 42 &amp; in  the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n376-ref">[376]</sup> year of Nabonassar <a id="l4303"></a>68 extended it over Babylon. Then he carried the remainder <a id="l4304"></a>of the Samaritans into captivity &amp; peopled Samaria with captives <a id="l4305"></a>brought from several parts of his kingdom, the Dinaites, the Aphar<a id="l4306"></a>sachites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Baby<a id="l4307"></a>lonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, the Elamites (Ezra IV. 2, 9) &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p081r"> &lt;81r&gt; </span> therefore he reigned over all these nations. Pekah &amp; Rezin kings of Sa<a id="l4308"></a>maria &amp; Damascus invaded Iudæa in the first year of Ahaz, &amp; within 65 <a id="l4309"></a>years after, that is, in the 21<sup>th</sup> year of Manasseh, Anno Nabonass. 69, Samaria <a id="l4310"></a>by this captivity ceased to be a people (Isa. VII. 8,) Then Asserhadon invaded <a id="l4311"></a>Iudea, took Azot, carried Manasses captive to Babylon, &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n377-ref">[377]</sup> captivated also <a id="l4312"></a>Egypt, Thebais, &amp; Ethiopia above Thebais. And by this war he seems to <a id="l4313"></a>have put an end to the reign of the Ethiopians over Egypt in the year of <a id="l4314"></a>Nabonassar 77 or 78.</p>
<p id="par366">In the reign of Sennacherib &amp; Asserhadon, the Assyrian Empire <a id="l4315"></a>seems arrived at its greatness, being united under one Monarch, &amp; con<a id="l4316"></a>taining Assyria, Media, Apolloniatis, Susiana, Chaldea, Mesopotamia, <a id="l4317"></a>Cilicia, Syria, Phœnicia, Egypt, Ethiopia, &amp; part of Arabia &amp; reaching <a id="l4318"></a>eastward into Elymais &amp; Parætacene a Province of the Medes. And if <a id="l4319"></a>Chalach &amp; Habor be Colchos &amp; Iberia (as some think, &amp; as may seem <a id="l4320"></a>probable from the circumcision used by those nations till the days of <a id="l4321"></a>Herodotus) we are also to add these two Provinces with the two Arme<a id="l4322"></a>nias Pontus &amp; Cappadocia as far as to the river Halys. For <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n378-ref">[378]</sup> Herodotus <a id="l4323"></a>tells us that the people of Cappadocia as far as to that river were called <a id="l4324"></a>Syrians by the Greeks both before &amp; after the days of Cyrus, &amp; that <a id="l4325"></a>the Assyrians were also called Syrians by the Greeks.</p>
<p id="par367">Yet the Medes revolted from the Assyrians in the latter end <a id="l4326"></a>of the reign of Sennacherib, I think upon the slaughter of his army <a id="l4327"></a>neare Egypt &amp; his flight to Nineveh. For at that time the estate of <a id="l4328"></a>Sennacherib was troubled so that Tobit could not go into Media as <a id="l4329"></a>he had done before, Tobit I. 15. And sometime after, Tobit advised his <a id="l4330"></a>son to go into Media where he might expect peace while Nineveh ac<a id="l4331"></a>cording to the prophesy of Ionah, should be destroyed. Ctesias wrote that <a id="l4332"></a>Arbaces  a Mede being admitted to see Sardanapalus in his palace <a id="l4333"></a>&amp; observing his voluptuous life amongst weomen, revolted with the <a id="l4334"></a>Medes, &amp; in conjunction with Belesis a Babylonian overcame him &amp; <a id="l4335"></a>caused him to set fire to his palace &amp; burn himself. But he is con<a id="l4336"></a>tradicted by other authors of better credit. For Duris &amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n379-ref">[379]</sup> many others <a id="l4337"></a>wrote that Arbaces upon being admitted into the Palace of Sardanapa<a id="l4338"></a>lus &amp; seeing his effeminate life slew himself; &amp; Cleitarchus that Sardana<a id="l4339"></a>palus died of old age after he had lost his dominion over Syria. He lost <a id="l4340"></a>it by the revolt of the western nations. And Herodotus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n380-ref">[380]</sup> tells us, that the Medes <a id="l4341"></a>revolted first, &amp; defended their liberty by force of arms against the As<a id="l4342"></a>syrians without conquering them; &amp;  at their first revolting had <a id="l4343"></a>no King, but after some time, set up Dejoces over them, &amp; built Ecba<a id="l4344"></a>tane for his residence; &amp; that Dejoces reigned only over Media, &amp; <a id="l4345"></a>had a peaceable reign of 54 years, but his son &amp; successor Phraortes made war <a id="l4346"></a>upon his neighbours &amp; conquered Persia; &amp; that the Syrians also &amp; other western nations <a id="l4347"></a>at length revolted from the Assyrians, being encouraged thereunto by <a id="l4348"></a>the example of the Medes; &amp; that  after the revolt of the ~ <a id="l4349"></a>western nations, Phraortes invaded the Assyrians but was slain by them <a id="l4350"></a>in that war after he had reigned twenty &amp; two years. He was succeeded by  Astyages. </p>
    <p id="par368">Now Asserhadon seems to be the Sardanapalus who died of old <a id="l4351"></a>age after the revolt of Syria, the name Sardanapalus being derived <a id="l4352"></a>from Asserhadon-Pul. Sardanapalus was the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n381-ref">[381]</sup> son of Anacyndaraxis, <a id="l4353"></a>Cyndaraxis or Anabaxaris King of Assyria; &amp; this name seems to have <a id="l4354"></a>been corruptly written for Sennacherib the father of Asserhadon. Sardana<a id="l4355"></a>palus built Tarsus &amp; Anchiale in one day, &amp; therefore reigned over <a id="l4356"></a>Cilicia before the revolt of the western nations. And if he be the same <a id="l4357"></a>king with Asserhadon he was succeeded by Saosduchinus in the year <a id="l4358"></a>of Nabonassar 81. And by this revolution Manasseh was set at liberty <a id="l4359"></a>to return home &amp; fortify Ierusalem. And the Egyptians also, after the <a id="l4360"></a>Assyrians had harrassed Egypt &amp; Ethiopia three years (Isa. XX. 3, 4) were <a id="l4361"></a>set at liberty, &amp; continued under twelve contemporary kings of their own <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p082r"> &lt;82r&gt; </span> nation, as above. The Assyrians invaded &amp; conquered the Egyptians the first <a id="l4362"></a>of the three years, &amp; reigned over them two years more: &amp; these two years <a id="l4363"></a>are the interregnum which Africanus (from Manetho) places next before <a id="l4364"></a>the twelve kings. The Scythians of Touran or Turquestan beyond the <a id="l4365"></a>river Oxus began in those days to infest Persia, &amp; by one of their inroads <a id="l4366"></a>might give occasion to the revolt of the western nations.</p>
<p id="par369">In the year of Nabonassar 101 Saosduchinus after a reign of twenty years was succeeded <a id="l4367"></a>at Babylon by Chyniladon, &amp; I think at Nineveh  also, For I take Chyniladon to be  that Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l4368"></a>who is mentioned in the book of Iudeth. For the history of that king suits <a id="l4369"></a>best with these times. For there it is said that Nebuchadnezzar King <a id="l4370"></a>of the Assyrians who reigned at Nineveh that great city, in the <a id="l4371"></a>twelft year of his reign made war upon Arphaxad King of the <a id="l4372"></a>Medes, &amp; was then left alone by a defection of the auxiliary nations <a id="l4373"></a>of Cilicia, Damascus, Syria, Phœnicia, Moab, Ammon, &amp; Egypt; <a id="l4374"></a>&amp; without their help routed the army of the Medes &amp; slew Ar<a id="l4375"></a>phaxad. And Arphaxad is there said to have built Ecbatane &amp; <a id="l4376"></a>therefore was either Dejoces, or his son Phraortes who might finish the <a id="l4377"></a>city founded by his father. And Herodotus tells the same story of a <a id="l4378"></a>king of Assyria who routed the Medes, &amp; slew their King Phra<a id="l4379"></a>ortes; &amp; saith that in the time of this war the Assyrians were <a id="l4380"></a>left alone by the defection of the auxiliary nations, being other<a id="l4381"></a>wise in good condition. Arphaxad was therefore the Phraortes of <a id="l4382"></a>Herodotus, &amp; by consequence was slain neare the beginning of <a id="l4383"></a>the reign of Iosiah. For this war was made after Phœnicia, Moab, Ammon, <a id="l4384"></a>&amp; Egypt had been conquered &amp; revolted (Iudeth 1. 7, 8, 9) &amp; by consequence <a id="l4385"></a>after the reign of Asserhadon who conquered them. It was made when <a id="l4386"></a>the Iews were newly returned from captivity &amp; the vessels &amp; altar &amp; <a id="l4387"></a>Temple were sanctified after the profanation (Iudeth IV. 3) that is <a id="l4388"></a>soon after Manasseh their king had been carried captive to Babylon <a id="l4389"></a>by Asserhadon, &amp; upon the death of that king or some other change <a id="l4390"></a>in the Assyrian Empire had been released with the Iews from that <a id="l4391"></a>captivity, &amp; had repaired the altar &amp; restored the sacrifices &amp; wor<a id="l4392"></a>ship of the Temple, 2 Chron. XXXII. 11, 16. In the Greek version of the <a id="l4393"></a>book of Iudeth (Chap. V. 18) it is said that <em class="underline">the Temple of God was <a id="l4394"></a>cast to the ground</em> ; but this is not said in Ieroms version, &amp; in <a id="l4395"></a>the greek version, chap. IV. 3, &amp; chap. XVI. 20, it is said that <em class="underline">the vessels <a id="l4396"></a>&amp; the altar &amp; the house were sanctified after the prophanation</em>, &amp; in <a id="l4397"></a>both versions, chap. IV. 11, the Temple is represented standing.</p>
    <p id="par370">After this war Nebuchadnezzar king of Assyria in the 13<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l4398"></a>of his reign (according to the version of Ierome) sent his captain Olo<a id="l4399"></a>fernes with a great army to avenge himself on all the west country <a id="l4400"></a>because they had disobeyed his commandment; &amp; Holofernes went forth <a id="l4401"></a>with an army of 12000 horse &amp; 120000 foot of Assyrians Medes <a id="l4402"></a>&amp; Persians, &amp; reduced Cilicia, Mesopotamia, &amp; Syria, &amp; Damascus, <a id="l4403"></a>&amp; part of Arabia, &amp; Ammon, &amp; Edom, &amp; Madian, &amp; then came <a id="l4404"></a>against Iudæa. And this was done when the government was in the hands <a id="l4405"></a>of the high Priest &amp; ancients of Israel (Iudeth IV. 8. &amp; VII. 23) &amp; by con<a id="l4406"></a>sequence not in the reign of Manasseh or Amon, but when Iosiah was <a id="l4407"></a>a child: In times of prosperity the children of Israel were apt to go – <a id="l4408"></a>after false gods, &amp; in times of affliction to repent &amp; turn to the Lord. So <a id="l4409"></a>Manasseh a very wicked king, being captivated by the Assyrians, repented; <a id="l4410"></a>&amp; being released from captivity restored the worship of the true God. <a id="l4411"></a>And so when we are told that Iosiah in the eighth year of his reign <a id="l4412"></a>while he was yet young began to seek after the God of his father <a id="l4413"></a> &amp; in the twelfth year of his reign began to purge <a id="l4414"></a>Iudah &amp; Ierusalem from Idolatry, &amp; to destroy the High places &amp; Groves <a id="l4415"></a>&amp; Altars &amp; Images of Baalim, (2 Chron. XXXIV. 3) we may understand that these acts of <a id="l4416"></a>religion were occasioned by impending dangers &amp; escapes from danger. <a id="l4417"></a>When Olofernes came against the western nations &amp; spoiled them, Then <a id="l4418"></a>were the Iews terrified, &amp; they fortified Iudea &amp; <em class="underline">cryed unto God with <a id="l4419"></a>great fervency, &amp; humbled themselves in sackcloth, &amp; put ashes on</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p083r"> &lt;83r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">their heads, &amp; cried unto the God of Israel that he would not give their <a id="l4420"></a>wives &amp; their children &amp; cities for a prey, &amp; the Temple for a profana<a id="l4421"></a>tion : &amp; the High-priest &amp; all the Priests put on sackcloth &amp; ashes &amp; <a id="l4422"></a>offered daily burnt offerings with vows &amp; free gifts of the people</em> (Iudeth <a id="l4423"></a>IV) &amp; then began Iosiah to seek  after the God of his father <a id="l4424"></a>David. And after Iudeth had slain Olofernes &amp; the Assyrians were <a id="l4425"></a>fled &amp; the Iews who pursued them were returned to Ierusalem <em class="underline">they <a id="l4426"></a>worshipped the Lord &amp; offered burnt offerings &amp; gifts &amp; continued <a id="l4427"></a>feasting before the sanctuary for the space of three months</em> (Iudeth <a id="l4428"></a>XVI. 18) &amp; then did Iosiah purge Iudah &amp; Ierusalem from idolatry. <a id="l4429"></a>Whence it seems to me that the eighth year of Iosiah fell in with the <a id="l4430"></a>fourteenth or fifteenth of Nebuchadonosor, &amp; that the twelft year of <a id="l4431"></a>Nebuchadonosor in which Phraortes was slain was the fift or sixt <a id="l4432"></a>of Iosiah. Phraortes reigned 22 years according to Herodotus, &amp;  therefore succeeded <a id="l4434"></a>his father Dejoces about the 40<sup>th</sup> year of Manasses, Anno Nabonass. <a id="l4435"></a>89, &amp; was slain by the Assyrians &amp; succeeded by Astyages Anno Nabonass. 111. Dejoces reigned <a id="l4436"></a>53 years according to Herodotus, &amp; these years began in the 16<sup>th</sup> <a id="l4437"></a>year of Hezekiah : which makes it probable that the Medes dated <a id="l4438"></a>them from the time of their revolt. And according to all this <a id="l4439"></a>recconing, the reign of Nebuchadonosor fell in with that of Chinil<a id="l4440"></a>adon : which makes it probable that they were but two names of <a id="l4441"></a>one &amp; the same King. </p>
<p id="par371">Soon after the death of Phraortes<sup class="note" id="n382-ref">[382]</sup> the Scythians under Madyes or <a id="l4443"></a>Medus invaded Media &amp; beat the Medes in battel Anno Nabonass 113, &amp; <a id="l4444"></a>went thence towards Egypt, but were met in Phœnicia by Psammiticus <a id="l4445"></a>&amp; bought off, &amp; returning reigned over a great part of Asia : but in <a id="l4446"></a>the end of about 28 years were expelled; many of their princes <a id="l4447"></a>&amp; commanders being slain in a feast by the Medes under the <a id="l4448"></a>conduct of Cyaxeres the successor of Astyages just before the de<a id="l4449"></a>struction of Nineveh, &amp; the rest being soon after forced to <a id="l4450"></a>retire.</p>
<p id="par372"> In the year of Nabonassar 123 <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n383-ref">[383]</sup> Nabopolassar the commander of the forces of Chyniladon the King of Assyria in Chaldea revolted from him &amp; became king of Babylon. And Chyniladon was either then or soon after succeeded at Nineveh by the last King of Assyria called Sarac by Polyhistor. And at length Nebuchad<a id="l4453"></a>nezzar the son of Nabopolassar marryed Amyite the daughter of <a id="l4454"></a>Astyages &amp; sister of Cyaxeres. And by this marriage the two  families <a id="l4455"></a>having contracted affinity they conspired against the Assyrians. <a id="l4456"></a>  And Nabopolasser being now grown old, &amp; Astyages being dead <a id="l4457"></a>&amp; their sons Nebuchadnezzar &amp; Cyaxeres led the armies <a id="l4458"></a>of the two nations against Nineveh, slew Sarac, destroyed the city, <a id="l4459"></a>&amp; shared the Kingdom of the Assyrians. This victory the Iews refer <a id="l4460"></a>to the Chaldeans; the Greeks to the Medes; Tobit, Polyhistor, Iosephus, <a id="l4461"></a>&amp; Ctesias to both. It gave a beginning to the great successes of <a id="l4462"></a>Nebuchadnezzar &amp; Cyaxeres, &amp; laid the foundation of the two <a id="l4463"></a>collateral Empires of the Babylonians &amp; Medes, these being <a id="l4464"></a>branches of the Assyrian Empire. And thence the time of the <a id="l4465"></a>fall of the Assyrian Empire is determined, the conquerors being <a id="l4466"></a>then in their youth. In the reign of Iosiah, when Zephany pro<a id="l4467"></a>phesied, Nineveh &amp; the Kingdom of Assyria were standing, &amp; their <a id="l4468"></a>fall was predicted by that prophet (Zeph. I.1 &amp; II.13) &amp; in the end of <a id="l4469"></a>his reign Pharaoh Nechoh King of Egypt, the successor of Psammiticus <a id="l4470"></a>went up against the King of Assyria to the river Euphrates to fight <a id="l4471"></a>against Carchemish or Circutium, &amp; in his way thither slew Iosiah, <a id="l4472"></a>(2 Kings XXII 29, 2 Chron. XXXV.20,) &amp; therefore the last King of Assyria was not yet slain. <a id="l4473"></a>But in the third &amp; fourth year of Iehojakim the successor of Iosiah, <a id="l4474"></a>the two conquerors having taken Nineveh &amp; finished their war in <a id="l4475"></a>Assyria, prosecuted their conquests westward, &amp; leading their forces <a id="l4476"></a>against the King of Egypt as an invader of their right of conquest, <a id="l4477"></a>they beat him at Carchemish, &amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n384-ref">[384]</sup> took from him whatever he had newly <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p084r"> &lt;84r&gt; </span> taken from the Assyrians: &amp; therefore we cannot err above a year or <a id="l4478"></a>two if we refer the destruction of Nineveh &amp; fall of the Assyrian Em<a id="l4479"></a>pire to the second year of Iehojakim Anno Nabonass. 140. The name <a id="l4480"></a>of the last King Sarac might perhaps be contracted from Sarche<a id="l4481"></a>don, as this name was from Asserhadon, Asserhadonpul or Sar<a id="l4482"></a>danapalus.</p>
<p id="par373">While the Assyrians reigned at Nineveh, Persia was divid<a id="l4483"></a>ed into several Kingdoms. And amongst others there was a Kingdom <a id="l4484"></a>of Elam which flourished in the days of Hezekiah, Manasseh, Iosiah, <a id="l4485"></a>&amp; Iehojakim Kings of Iudah, &amp; fell in the days of Zedekiah, Ier. <a id="l4486"></a>XXV. 25, &amp; XLIX. 34, &amp; Ezek. XXXII. 24. This Kingdom seems to <a id="l4487"></a>have been potent, &amp; to have had warrs with the King of Touran <a id="l4488"></a>or Scythia beyond the river Oxus with various success &amp; at <a id="l4489"></a>length to have been subdued by the Medes &amp; Babylonians, or one <a id="l4490"></a>of them. For while Nebuchadnezzar warred in the west, Cyax<a id="l4491"></a>eres recovered the Assyrian provinces of Armenia, Pontus, &amp; Cappadocia &amp; <a id="l4492"></a>then they went eastward against the Provinces of Persia &amp; Parthia. <a id="l4493"></a>Whether the Pischdadians whom the Persians reccon to have been <a id="l4494"></a>their oldest kings, were Kings of  the Kingdom of Elam, or of <a id="l4495"></a>that of the Assyrians, &amp; whether Elam was conquered by the <a id="l4496"></a>Assyrians at the same time with Babylonia &amp; Susiana in the <a id="l4497"></a>reign of Asserhaden &amp; soon after revolted, I leave to be examined.</p>

<h2 id="hd8" class="cent">Chap. IV. <a id="l4498"></a><br>Of the two Contemporary Empires <a id="l4499"></a><br>of the Babylonians &amp; Medes.</h2>
<p id="par374">By the fall of the Assyrian Empire the Kingdoms of the Baby<a id="l4500"></a>lonians &amp; Medes grew great &amp; potent. The reigns of the Kings of <a id="l4501"></a>Babylon are stated in Ptolemy's Canon : for understanding of which <a id="l4502"></a>you are to note that every Kings reign in that Canon began with <a id="l4503"></a>the last Thoth of his  predecessors reign, as I gather by comparing the <a id="l4504"></a>reigns of the Roman Emperors in that Canon with their reigns <a id="l4505"></a>recorded in years months &amp; days by other authors. Whence it <a id="l4506"></a>appears from that Canon that Asserhadon died in the year of <a id="l4507"></a>Nabonassar 81, Saosduchinus his successor in the year 101, Chin<a id="l4508"></a>iladon in the year 123, Nabopolassar in the year 144, &amp; Nebu<a id="l4509"></a>chadnezzar in the year 187. All these kings, &amp; some others mention<a id="l4510"></a>ed in the Canon, reigned successively over Babylon, &amp; this last king died in the 37<sup>th</sup> year of Iehojakins captivity (2 Kings. XXV. 27) &amp; <a id="l4511"></a>therefore Iehojakin was captivated in the 150<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonassar.</p>
<p id="par375">This captivity was in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzars reign (2 King. <a id="l4512"></a>XIV. 12) &amp; eleventh of Iehojakims. For the first year of Nebuchadnezzars <a id="l4513"></a>reign was the fourth of Iehojakims (Ier. XXV. 1) &amp; Iehojakim reigned <a id="l4514"></a>eleven years before this captivity (2 King. XXIII. 36. 2 Chron. XXXVI. 5) <a id="l4515"></a>&amp; Iehojakin three months ending with the captivity. And the tenth year <a id="l4516"></a>of Iehojakins captivity was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar's <a id="l4517"></a>reign (Ier. XXXII. 1.) &amp; the eleventh year of Zedekiah in which Ierusa<a id="l4518"></a>lem was taken was the nineteenth of Nebuchadnezzar (Ier. L11. 5, 12;) <a id="l4519"></a>&amp; therefore Nebuchadnezzar began his reign in the year of ~ <a id="l4520"></a>Nabonassar 142, that is, two years before the death of his father <a id="l4521"></a>Nabpolassar, he being then made King by his father; &amp; Iehojakim <a id="l4522"></a>succeeded his father Iosiah in the year of Nabonassar 139; &amp; Ie<a id="l4523"></a>rusalem was taken &amp; the temple burnt in the year of Nabonassar <a id="l4524"></a>160, about twenty years after the destruction of Nineveh.</p>
<p id="par376">The reign of Darius Hystaspis over Persia by the Canon &amp; the consent <a id="l4525"></a>of all Chronologers, &amp; by several eclipses of the Moon, began in spring <a id="l4526"></a>in the year of Nabonassar 227. And <em class="underline">in the fourth year of King <a id="l4527"></a>Darius, in the 4<sup>th</sup> day of the ninth month, which is the month Chis<a id="l4528"></a>leu, when the Iews had sent unto the house of God saying, should <a id="l4529"></a>I weep in the fift month as I have done these so many years? the <a id="l4530"></a>word of the Lord came unto Zechariah, saying, speak to all the people <a id="l4531"></a>of the Land, &amp; to the Priests saying; When ye fasted &amp; mourned in <a id="l4532"></a>the fift &amp; seventh month even those seventy years, did ye at all <a id="l4533"></a>fast unto me</em>? Zech. VII. Count backwards those seventy years <a id="l4534"></a>in which they fasted in the fift month for the burning of the temple <a id="l4535"></a>&amp; in the seventh for the death of Gedaliah; &amp; the burning of the tem<a id="l4536"></a>ple &amp; death of Gedaliah will fall upon the fift &amp; seventh Iewish <a id="l4537"></a>months in the year of Nabonassar 160 as above.</p>
<p id="par377">As the Chaldean Astronomers counted the reigns of their Kings <a id="l4538"></a>by the years of Nabonassar, beginning with the month <em class="underline">Thoth</em>, so <a id="l4539"></a>the Iews (as their authors tell us) counted the reigns of their's <a id="l4540"></a>by the years of Moses, beginning every year with the month Nisan. For if any King began his reign a few days before this month began, <a id="l4541"></a>it was recconed to him for a whole year, &amp; the beginning of this <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p086r"> &lt;86r&gt; </span> month was accounted the beginning of the second year of his reign. <a id="l4542"></a>And according to this recconing the first year of Iehojakim began with <a id="l4543"></a>the month Nisan, Anno Nabonass 139, tho his reign might not really <a id="l4544"></a>begin till five or six months after; &amp; the fourth year of Iehoja<a id="l4545"></a>kim &amp; first of Nebuchadnezzar (according to the recconing of the <a id="l4546"></a>Iews) began with the month Nisan Anno Nabonass. 142; &amp; the first <a id="l4547"></a>year of Zedekiah &amp; of Iehnojakin's captivity &amp; ninth year of Nebu<a id="l4548"></a>chadnezzar began with the month Nisan in the year of Nabonassar <a id="l4549"></a>150; &amp; the tenth year of Zedekiah &amp; 18<sup>th</sup> of Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l4550"></a>began with the month <em class="underline">Nisan</em> in the year of Nabonassar 159. Now <a id="l4551"></a>in the ninth year of Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzar invaded Iudea &amp; the <a id="l4552"></a>cities thereof, &amp; in the tenth month of that year &amp; tenth day of the month <a id="l4553"></a>he &amp; his host besieged Ierusalem, ( 2 King. XXV. 1, Ier. XXXIV. 1, &amp;  <a id="l4554"></a>XXXIX. 1, &amp; LII. 4) From this time to the tenth month in the second <a id="l4555"></a>year of Darius are just seventy years, and accordingly on the 24<sup>th</sup> <a id="l4556"></a>day of the eleventh month of this second year of Darius, the word <a id="l4557"></a>of the Lord came to Zechariah, &amp; <em class="underline">the Angel of the Lord said, Oh <a id="l4558"></a>Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Ierusalem &amp; <a id="l4559"></a>on the cities of Iudah against which thou hast had indignation these <a id="l4560"></a>threescore &amp; ten years</em>,  <a id="l4561"></a>Zech. 1. 7, 12. So then the ninth year of Zedekiah in which this <a id="l4562"></a>Indignation against Ierusalem &amp; the cities of Iudah began, com<a id="l4563"></a>menced with the month <em class="underline">Nisan</em> in the year of Nabonassar 158; &amp; <a id="l4564"></a>the eleventh year of Zedekiah &amp; nineteenth of Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l4565"></a>in which the city was taken &amp; the temple burnt, commenced with <a id="l4566"></a>the month Nisan in the year of Nabonassar 160 as above.</p>
<p id="par378">By all these characters the years of Iehojakim, Zedekiah, <a id="l4567"></a>&amp; Nebuchadnezzar seem to be  sufficiently determined &amp; thereby <a id="l4568"></a>the chronology of the Iews in the old Testament is connected with <a id="l4569"></a>that of later times. For between the death of Solomon &amp; the ninth <a id="l4570"></a>year of Zedekiah wherein Nebuchadnezzar invaded Iudea &amp; <a id="l4571"></a>began the siege of Ierusalem there were 390 years, as is <a id="l4572"></a>manifest both by the prophesy of Ezekiel chap. IV, &amp; by summing <a id="l4573"></a>up the years of the Kings of Iudah. And from the ninth year of <a id="l4574"></a>Zedekiah inclusively to the vulgar Æra of Christ there were <a id="l4575"></a>590 years. And both these numbers, with half the reign of <a id="l4576"></a>Solomon, make up a thousand years.</p>
    <p id="par379">In the end of the reign of Iosiah, Anno Nabonass. 139 <a id="l4577"></a>Pharaoh Necho the successor of Psammiticus<sup class="note" id="n385-ref">[385]</sup> came with a great <a id="l4578"></a>army out of Egypt against the King of Assyria, &amp; being denyed <a id="l4579"></a>passage through Iudea, beat the Iews at Megiddo or Magdolus <a id="l4580"></a>before Egypt, slew Iosiah their King, marched to Carchemish <a id="l4581"></a>or Circutium a town of Mesopotamia upon Euphrates &amp; took <a id="l4582"></a>it, possest himself of the cities of Syria, sent for Iehoahaz <a id="l4583"></a>the new King of Iudah to Riblah or Anticeh, deposed him there, <a id="l4584"></a>made Iehojakim King in the room of Iosiah, &amp; put the Kingdom <a id="l4585"></a>of Iudah to tribute. But the King of Assyria being in the mean <a id="l4586"></a>time besieged &amp; subdued &amp; Nineveh destroyed by Assuerus King <a id="l4587"></a>of the Medes &amp; Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon, &amp; the conquerors <a id="l4588"></a>being thereby entitled to the countries belonging to the King of Assy<a id="l4589"></a>ria, they led their victorious armies against the King of Egypt who <a id="l4590"></a>had seized part of them.

And by the con<a id="l4605"></a>quests over Assyria &amp; Syria the small Kingdom of Babylon was <a id="l4606"></a>erected into a potent Empire.</p>
<p id="par380">Whilst Nebuchadnezzar was acting in Syria, <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n391-ref">[391]</sup> his father <a id="l4607"></a>Nabopolasser died having reigned 21 years, &amp; Nebuchadnezzar upon <a id="l4608"></a>the news thereof, having ordered his affairs in Syria returned to <a id="l4609"></a>Babylon, leaving the captives &amp; his army with his servants to follow <a id="l4610"></a>him.

By the father he seems to understand that Labynitus who (as <a id="l4663"></a>he tells us) was King of Babylon when the great Eclips of the Sun pre<a id="l4664"></a>dicted by Thales put an end to the five years war between the Medes <a id="l4665"></a>&amp; Lydians; &amp; this was the great Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel calls the <a id="l4666"></a>last King of Babylon Beltshazzar, &amp; saith that Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l4667"></a>was his father. And Iosephus tells us that the last King of Babylon <a id="l4668"></a>was called Naboandel by the Babylonians &amp; reigned seventeen years; <a id="l4669"></a>&amp; therefore he is the same King of Babylon with Nabonedus or <a id="l4670"></a>Labynitus. And this is more agreeable to sacred writ than to make <a id="l4671"></a>Nabonidus a stranger to the royal line. For all nations were to <a id="l4672"></a>serve Nebuchadnezzar &amp; his posterity till the very time of his land <a id="l4673"></a>should come &amp; many nations should serve themselves of him, Ier. <a id="l4674"></a>XXXVII. 7. Belshazzar was born &amp; lived in honour before the fift year <a id="l4675"></a>of Iehojakin's captivity, which was the eleventh year of Nebuchadnezzar's <a id="l4676"></a>reign; &amp; therefore he was above 34 years old at the death of Evilme<a id="l4677"></a>rodach, &amp; so could be no other King than Nabonidus. For Laboasserdach <a id="l4678"></a>the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar was a child when he reigned.</p>
    <p id="par388">Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n400-ref">[400]</sup> tells us that there were two famous Queens of <a id="l4679"></a>Babylon, Semiramis &amp; Nitocris; &amp; that the latter was more skilfull. <a id="l4680"></a>She observing that the Kingdom of the Medes having subdued many <a id="l4681"></a>cities, &amp; among others Nineveh, was become great &amp; potent, inter<a id="l4682"></a>cepted &amp; fortified the passages out of Media into Babylonia; &amp; the <a id="l4683"></a>river which before was straight, she made crooked with great ~ <a id="l4684"></a>windings, that it might be more sedate &amp; less apt to overflow.  <a id="l4685"></a>And on the side of the river above Babylon, in imitation of the <a id="l4686"></a>Lake of Mœris in Egypt, she dug a lake every way forty miles <a id="l4687"></a>broad to receive the water of the river &amp; keep it for watering <a id="l4688"></a>the land. She built also a bridge over the river in the middle of <a id="l4689"></a>Babylon, turning the stream into the lake till the bridge was built. <a id="l4690"></a>Philostratus saith<sup class="note" id="n401-ref">[401]</sup> that she made a bridge under the river two ~ <a id="l4691"></a>fathomes broad, meaning an arched vault over which the river <a id="l4692"></a>flowed, &amp; under which they might walk cross the river. He calls her <a id="l4693"></a>Μηδεια a Mede.</p>
    <p id="par389">Berosus tells us that Nebuchadnezzar built a pensile garden upon <a id="l4694"></a>arches because his wife was a Mede &amp; delighted in mountanous prospects such <a id="l4695"></a>as abounded in Media but were wanting in Babylonia. She was Amyite <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p089r"> &lt;89r&gt; </span> the daughter of Astyages &amp; sister of Cyaxeres Kings of the Medes. Ne<a id="l4696"></a>buchadnezzar married her upon a league between the two families <a id="l4697"></a>against the King of Assyria. But Nitocris might be another woman <a id="l4698"></a>who in the reign of her son Labynitus a voluptuous &amp; vitious king, took <a id="l4699"></a>care of his affairs, &amp; for securing his kingdom against the Medes, did the <a id="l4700"></a>works above mentioned. This is that Queen mentioned in Daniel, chap. V. 10.</p>
<p id="par390">Iosephus relates out of the Tyrian records that in the reign of <a id="l4701"></a>Ithobalus King of Tyre, that city was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l4702"></a>thirteen years together. In the end of that siege Ithobalus their King <a id="l4703"></a>was slain (Ezek. XXVIII.8, 9, 10) &amp; after him according to the Tyrian <a id="l4704"></a>records reigned Baal ten years, Ecnibalus &amp; Chelbis one year, Ab<a id="l4705"></a>barus three months, Mitgonius &amp; Gerastratus six years, Balatorus <a id="l4706"></a>one year, Merbalus four years, &amp; Iromus twenty years: &amp; in the <a id="l4707"></a>fourteenth year of Iromus, say the Tyrian Records, the reign of <a id="l4708"></a>Cyrus began in Babylonia. Therefore the siege of Tyre began <a id="l4709"></a>48 years &amp; some months before the reign of Cyrus in Babylonia. <a id="l4710"></a>It began when Ierusalem had been newly taken &amp; burnt with the <a id="l4711"></a>temple (Ezek. 26) &amp; by consequence after the eleventh year of <a id="l4712"></a>Iehojakins captivity, or  160<em class="underline">th</em> <a id="l4714"></a>year of Nabonassar &amp; therefore the reign of Cyrus in Babylonia <a id="l4715"></a>began after the year of Nabonassar 208. It ended before the <a id="l4716"></a>eight &amp; twentieth year of Ieconiah's captivity or 176<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l4717"></a>Nabonassar (Ezek. XXIX.17) &amp; therefore the reign of Cyrus in <a id="l4718"></a>Babylonia began before the year of Nabonassar 211. By this <a id="l4719"></a>argument the first year of Cyrus in Babylonia was one of the <a id="l4720"></a>two intermediate years 209, 210. Cyrus<sup class="note" id="n402-ref">[402]</sup> invaded Babylonia <a id="l4721"></a>in the year of Nabonassar 209; Babylon held out, &amp; the next <a id="l4722"></a>year was taken (Ier. LI. 39, 57) by diverting the river Euphra<a id="l4723"></a>tes &amp; entring the city through the emptied channel, &amp; by consequence <a id="l4724"></a>after midsummer<sup class="note" id="n403-ref">[403]</sup>. For the river by the melting of the snow in <a id="l4725"></a>Armenia, overflows yearly in the beginning of summer, but in <a id="l4726"></a>the heat of summer grows low<sup class="note" id="n404-ref">[404]</sup>. And that night was the King of <a id="l4727"></a>Babylon slain, &amp; Darius the Mede or King of the Medes took the <a id="l4728"></a>Kingdom being about threescore &amp; two years old. So then Babylon <a id="l4729"></a>was taken a month or two after the summer solstice in the <a id="l4730"></a>year of Nabonassar 210 ; as the Canon also represents.</p>
    <p id="par391">We have said that the Kings of the Medes before Cyrus were <a id="l4731"></a>Dejoces, Phraortes, Astyages Cyaxeres &amp; Darius. The three first reign<a id="l4732"></a>ed before the Kingdom grew great, the two last were great conquerors <a id="l4733"></a>&amp; erected the empire.

<p id="par392">The Poet here attributes the founding of the Medo-Persian Empire <a id="l4737"></a>to the two immediate predecessors of Cyrus, the first of which was <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p090r"> &lt;90r&gt; </span> a Mede, &amp; the second was his son. The second was Darius the Mede, the <a id="l4738"></a>immediate predecessor of Cyrus according to Daniel; &amp; therefore the <a id="l4739"></a>first was the father of Darius, that is, Achsuerus, Assuerus, Oxyares, <a id="l4740"></a>Axeres, prince Axeres, or Cy-Axeres, the word Cy signifying a prince. <a id="l4741"></a>For Daniel tells us that Darius was the son of Achsuerus (or Ahasuerus, <a id="l4742"></a>as the Masoretes erroneously call him) of the seed of the Medes, that is, <a id="l4743"></a>of the seed royal. This is that Assuerus who together with Nebu<a id="l4744"></a>chadnezzar took &amp; destroyed Nineveh according to Tobit: which action <a id="l4745"></a>is by the Greeks ascribed to Cyaxeres, &amp; by Eupolemus to Astibares <a id="l4746"></a>a name perhaps corruptly written for Assuerus. By this victory over <a id="l4747"></a>the Assyrians &amp; subversion of their Empire seated at Nineveh, &amp; the <a id="l4748"></a>ensuing conquests of Armenia Cappadocia &amp; Persia, he began to <a id="l4749"></a>extend the reign of one man over all Asia; &amp; his son Darius the <a id="l4750"></a>Mede, by conquering the Kingdoms of Lydia &amp; Babylon finished the <a id="l4751"></a>work. And the third King was Cyrus a happy man for his great suc<a id="l4752"></a>cesses under &amp; against Darius, &amp; large &amp; peaceable dominion in his <a id="l4753"></a>own reign.</p>
    <p id="par393">Cyrus lived seventy years according to Cicero, &amp; reigned nine <a id="l4754"></a>years over Babylon according to Ptolomy's Canon, &amp; therefore was 61 <a id="l4755"></a>years old at the taking of Babylon: at which time Darius the Mede <a id="l4756"></a>was 62 years old according to Daniel. And therefore Darius was two <a id="l4757"></a>generations younger than Astyages the grandfather of Cyrus.. For Astyages <a id="l4758"></a>(according to both <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n406-ref">[406]</sup> Herodotus &amp; Xenophon) gave his daughter Man<a id="l4759"></a>dane to Cambyses a prince of Persia, and by them became the grand<a id="l4760"></a>father of Cyrus, &amp; Cyaxeres was the son of Astyages (according <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n407-ref">[407]</sup> to Xe<a id="l4761"></a>nophon) &amp; gave his daughter to Cyrus. This daughter <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n408-ref">[408]</sup> saith Xenophon, <a id="l4762"></a>was reported to be very handsome, &amp; used to play with Cyrus when they <a id="l4763"></a>were both children, &amp; to say that she would marry him: &amp; therefore they <a id="l4764"></a>were much of the same age. Xenophon saith that Cyrus married her <a id="l4765"></a>after the taking of Babylon : but she was then an old woman. It's more <a id="l4766"></a>probable that he married her while she was young &amp; handsome &amp; he a young <a id="l4767"></a>man; &amp; that because he was the brother in law of Darius the King, he <a id="l4768"></a>led the armies of the Kingdom until he revolted. So then Astyages, <a id="l4769"></a>Cyaxeres &amp; Darius reigned successively over the Medes; &amp; Cyrus <a id="l4770"></a>was the grandson of Astyages &amp; married the sister of Darius &amp; succeeded <a id="l4771"></a>him in the throne.</p>
    <p id="par394">Herodotus therefore hath inverted the order of the Kings <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n409-ref">[409]</sup> Astyages &amp; <a id="l4772"></a>Cyaxeres, making Cyaxeres to be the son &amp; successor of Phraortes &amp; the father <a id="l4773"></a>&amp; predecessor of Astyages the father of Mandane &amp; grandfather of Cyrus, <a id="l4774"></a>&amp; telling us that this Astyages married Ariene the daughter of Alyattes <a id="l4775"></a>King of Lydia, &amp; was at length taken prisoner &amp; deprived of his dominion <a id="l4776"></a>by Cyrus. And Pausanias hath copied after Herodotus in telling us that Asty<a id="l4777"></a>ages the son of Cyaxeres reigned in Media in the days of Alyattes <a id="l4778"></a>King of Lydia. Cyaxeres had a son who married Aryene the daughter <a id="l4779"></a>of Alyattes; but this son was not the father of Mandane &amp; grandfather <a id="l4780"></a>of Cyrus,  but of the same age with Cyrus. And his true name is ~ <a id="l4781"></a>preserved in the name of the Darics which upon the conquest of Crœsus <a id="l4782"></a>by the conduct of his General Cyrus, he coyned out of the gold &amp; silver <a id="l4783"></a>of the conquered Lydians. His name was therefore Darius, as he is called <a id="l4784"></a>by Daniel. For Daniel tells us that this Darius was a Mede, &amp; that his <a id="l4785"></a>father's name was Assuerus, that is Axeres or Cyaxeres as above. <a id="l4786"></a>Considering therefore that Cyaxeres reigned long, &amp; that no author men<a id="l4787"></a>tions more Kings of Media than one called Astyages, &amp; that Æschylus who <a id="l4788"></a>lived in those days knew but of two great monarchs of Media &amp; Persia, <a id="l4789"></a>(the father &amp; the son,) older than Cyrus: it seems to me that Astyages <a id="l4790"></a>the father of Mandane &amp; grandfather of Cyrus was the father &amp; predecessor <a id="l4791"></a>of Cyaxeres; &amp; that the son &amp; successor of Cyaxeres was called Darius. <a id="l4792"></a>Cyaxeres <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n410-ref">[410]</sup> according to Herodotus reigned 40 years, &amp; his successor <a id="l4793"></a>35, &amp; Cyrus according to Xenophon seven. Cyrus died Anno Nabonass. <a id="l4794"></a>219 according to the Canon, &amp; therefore Cyaxeres died anno Nabonass. 177 <a id="l4795"></a>&amp; began his reign anno Nabonass. 137, &amp; his father Astyages reigned 26 years <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p091r"> &lt;91r&gt; </span> beginning his reign at the death of Phraortes who was slain by the <a id="l4796"></a>Assyrians anno Nabonass 111 as above.</p>
<p id="par395">Of all the kings of the Medes Cyaxeres was greatest warrior. <a id="l4797"></a>Herodotus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n411-ref">[411]</sup> saith that he was much more valiant than his ancestors, &amp;; <a id="l4798"></a>that he was the first who divided the Kingdom into Provinces, &amp; reduced <a id="l4799"></a>the irregular &amp; undisciplined forces of the Medes into discipline &amp; <a id="l4800"></a>order. And therefore by the testimony of Herodotus he was that King <a id="l4801"></a>of the Medes whom Æschylus makes the first conqueror &amp; founder of <a id="l4802"></a>the Empire. For Herodotus represents him &amp; his son to have been the <a id="l4803"></a>two immediate predecessors of Cyrus, erring only in the name of the <a id="l4804"></a>son. Astyages did nothing  glorious. In the beginning of his reign a great <a id="l4805"></a>body of Scythians commanded by Madyes, <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n412-ref">[412]</sup> invaded Media &amp; Parthia <a id="l4806"></a>as above, &amp; reigned there about 28 years. But at length his son Cy<a id="l4807"></a>axeres circumvented &amp; slew them in a feast, &amp; made the rest fly to <a id="l4808"></a>their brethren in Parthia; &amp; immediately after, in conjunction with <a id="l4809"></a>Nebuchadnezzar, invaded &amp; subverted the Kingdom of Assyria &amp; <a id="l4810"></a>destroyed Nineveh.</p>
    <p id="par396">In the fourth year of Iehojakim which the Iews reccon to be <a id="l4811"></a>the first of Nebuchadnezzar( dating his reign from his being made King <a id="l4812"></a>by his father, or from the month Nisan preceding) when the victors <a id="l4813"></a>had newly shared the empire of the Assyrians, &amp; in prosecuting <a id="l4814"></a>their victory were invading Syria &amp; Phenicia, &amp; were ready to invade <a id="l4815"></a>the nations round about: God <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n413-ref">[413]</sup> threatned that he would take all the fa<a id="l4816"></a>milies of the north (that is, the armies of the Medes) &amp; Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l4817"></a>the King of Babylon &amp; bring them against Iudea &amp; against the nations <a id="l4818"></a>round about, &amp; utterly destroy those nations &amp; make them an astonishment <a id="l4819"></a>&amp; lasting desolations, &amp; cause them all to drink the wine-cup of his fury: <a id="l4820"></a>and in particular, names the Kings of Iudah &amp; Egypt, &amp; those of Edom <a id="l4821"></a>&amp; Moab &amp; Ammon, &amp; Tyre &amp; Sidon, &amp; the isles of the sea, &amp; Arabia, &amp; <a id="l4822"></a>Zimri, &amp; all the Kings of Elam, &amp; all the Kings of the Medes, &amp; all the <a id="l4823"></a>Kings of the north, &amp; the King of Sesack: &amp; that after seventy years, he <a id="l4824"></a>would also punish the King of Babylon. Here, in numbring the nations <a id="l4825"></a>which should suffer, he omits the Assyrians as fallen already, &amp; names <a id="l4826"></a>the Kings of Elam or Persia &amp; Sesac or Susa as distinct from those of the <a id="l4827"></a>Medes &amp; Babylonians: &amp; therefore the Persians were not yet subdued by <a id="l4828"></a>the Medes, nor the King of Susa by the Chaldeans. And as by the punish<a id="l4829"></a>ment of the King of Babylon he means the conquest of Babylon by the <a id="l4830"></a>Medes : so by the punishment of the Medes he seems to mean the conquest <a id="l4831"></a>of the Medes by Cyrus.</p>
    <p id="par397">After this, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, that is, in <a id="l4832"></a>the ninth year of Nebuchadnezzar, God threatned that he would give <a id="l4833"></a>the Kingdoms of <em class="underline">Edom Moab &amp; Ammon &amp; Tyre &amp; Zidon into the <a id="l4834"></a>hand of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon, &amp; that all the nations should <a id="l4835"></a>serve him &amp; his son &amp; son's son until the time of his land should come, <a id="l4836"></a>&amp; many nations &amp; great kings should serve themselves of him</em>, Ier. XXVII. <a id="l4837"></a>And at the same time God thus predicted the approaching conquest of the <a id="l4838"></a>Persians by the Medes &amp; their confederates. <em class="underline">Behold</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">I will break <a id="l4839"></a>the bow of Elam the chief of their might. And upon Elam will I <a id="l4840"></a>bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven &amp; will scatter <a id="l4841"></a>them towards all these winds, &amp; there shall be no nation towards <a id="l4842"></a>which the outcasts of Elam shall not come.

Ier. XLIX. 54, The Persians were <a id="l4850"></a>therefore hitherto a free nation under their own King, but soon after <a id="l4851"></a>this were invaded subdued captivated &amp; dispersed into the nations round <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p092r"> &lt;92r&gt; </span> about, &amp; continued in servitude until the reign of Cyrus. And since <a id="l4852"></a>the Medes &amp; Chaldeans did not conquer the Persians till after the <a id="l4853"></a>ninth yer of Nebuchadnezzar, it gives us occasion to enquire what <a id="l4854"></a>that active warrior Cyaxeres was doing  next after <a id="l4855"></a>the taking of Nineveh.</p>
<p id="par398">When Cyaxeres expelled the Scythians some of them made their peace <a id="l4856"></a>with him &amp; staid in Media &amp; presented to him daily some of the venison which <a id="l4857"></a>they took in hunting. But happening one day to catch nothing, Cyaxeres in <a id="l4858"></a>a passion treated them with opprobrious language. This they resented, <a id="l4859"></a>&amp; soon after killed one of the children of the Medes, dressed it like veneson, <a id="l4860"></a>&amp; presented it to Cyaxeres, &amp; then fled to Haliattes King of Lydia. Whence <a id="l4861"></a>followed a war of five years between the two Kings Cyaxeres &amp; Haliattes <a id="l4862"></a>And thence I gather that the Kingdoms of the Medes &amp; Lydians were now <a id="l4863"></a>contiguous, &amp; by consequence Cyaxeres, soon after the conquest of Nineveh, <a id="l4864"></a> seized the regions belonging to the Assyrians as far  as to the ~ <a id="l4865"></a>river Halys. In the sixt year of this war, in the midst of a battel between <a id="l4866"></a>the two Kings, there was a total eclips of the sun predicted by Thales. <a id="l4867"></a>And this Eclips fell upon the 28<sup>th</sup> of May, Anno Nabonass 163, forty &amp; <a id="l4868"></a>seven years before the taking of Babylon, &amp; put an end to the battel. <a id="l4869"></a>And thereupon the two Kings made peace by the mediation of Nebuchad<a id="l4870"></a>nezzar King of Babylon &amp; Siennesis King of Cilicia, &amp; the peace was <a id="l4871"></a>ratified by a marriage between Darius the son of Cyaxeres &amp; Ariene <a id="l4872"></a>the daughter of Haliattes: Darius was therefore fifteen or sixteen <a id="l4873"></a>years old at the time of this marriage. For he was 62 years old at the <a id="l4874"></a>taking of Babylon.</p>
<p id="par399">In the eleventh year of Zedekiahs reign, the year in which Nebu<a id="l4875"></a>chadnezzar took Ierusalem &amp; destroyed the temple, Ezekiel comparing the <a id="l4876"></a>Kingdoms of the east to trees in the garden of  Eden thus mentions their <a id="l4877"></a>being conquered by the Kings of the Medes &amp; Chaldeans. <em class="underline">Behold</em>, saith <a id="l4878"></a>he, <em class="underline">the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches</em> —— <em class="underline">his <a id="l4879"></a>height was exalted above all the trees of the field</em>, —— <em class="underline">&amp; under his <a id="l4880"></a>shadow dwelt all great nations</em> —— <em class="underline">no tree in the garden of God was <a id="l4881"></a>like unto him in his beauty</em> —— <em class="underline">but I have delivered him into the hand <a id="l4882"></a>of the mighty one of the heathen</em> —— <em class="underline">I made the nations to shake <a id="l4883"></a>at the sound of his fall when I cast him down to the grave with them <a id="l4884"></a>that descend into the pit.

Elam <a id="l4908"></a>or Persia was conquered by the Medes &amp; Susiana by the Babylonians <a id="l4909"></a>after the ninth &amp; before the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. And <a id="l4910"></a>therefore we cannot err much if we place these conquests in the <a id="l4911"></a>twelfth or fourteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. In the nineteenth <a id="l4912"></a>twentith &amp; one &amp; twentith year of this king he invaded &amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n414-ref">[414]</sup> conquered <a id="l4913"></a>Iudea, Moab, Ammon, Edom, the Philistims &amp; Zidon &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n415-ref">[415]</sup> the next year <a id="l4914"></a>he besieged Tyre &amp; after a siege of thirteen years he took it in the 35<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l4915"></a>of his reign, &amp; then he <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n416-ref">[416]</sup> invaded &amp; conquered Egypt Ethiopia &amp; Libya. <a id="l4916"></a>And about eighteen or twenty years after the death of this King Darius <a id="l4917"></a>the Mede conquered the Kingdome of Sardes, &amp; after five or six years <a id="l4918"></a>more he invaded &amp; conquered the  Empire of Ba<a id="l4919"></a>bylon, &amp; thereby finished the work of propagating the Medo-Persian <a id="l4920"></a>monarchy over all Asia, as Æschylus represents.</p>
    <p id="par401">Now this is that Darius who coined a great number of pieces of <a id="l4921"></a>pure gold called Daricks or <em class="underline">stateres Darici</em>. For Suidas Harpocration <a id="l4922"></a>&amp; the Scholiast of Aristophanes tell us that these were coined not by the <a id="l4923"></a>father of Xerxes but by an earlier Darius, by Darius the first, by the <a id="l4924"></a>first King of the Medes &amp; Persians who coined gold money. They were <a id="l4925"></a>stamped on one side with the effigies of an Archer who was crowned with a spiked <a id="l4926"></a>crown  had a bow in his left hand &amp; an arrow in his right &amp; was <a id="l4927"></a>cloathed with a long robe. For I have seen one of them in gold &amp; another <a id="l4928"></a>in silver. They were of the same weight &amp; value with the Attic stater <a id="l4929"></a>or piece of gold money weighing two Attic drachms. Darius seems to <a id="l4930"></a>have learnt the art &amp; use of money from the conquered Kingdom of <a id="l4931"></a>the Lydians &amp; to have recoined their gold. For the Medes before they <a id="l4932"></a>conquered the Lydians, had no money. Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n417-ref">[417]</sup> tells us that when <a id="l4933"></a>Crœsus was preparing to invade Cyrus, a certain Lydian called San<a id="l4934"></a>danis advised Crœsus that he was preparing an expedition against a <a id="l4935"></a>nation who were cloathed with leathern breeches, who eat not such <a id="l4936"></a>victuals as they would but such as their barren country afforded; who <a id="l4937"></a>drank no wine but water only, who eat no figgs nor other good meat, <a id="l4938"></a>who had nothing to lose but might get much from the Lydians. For <a id="l4939"></a>the Persians, saith Herodotus, before they conquered the Lydians had <a id="l4940"></a>nothing rich or valuable. And<sup class="note" id="n418-ref">[418]</sup> Isaiah tells us that the Medes regard<a id="l4941"></a>ed not silver, nor desired gold. But the Lydians &amp; Phrygians were <a id="l4942"></a>exceeding rich even to a proverb. <em class="underline">Midas &amp; Crœsus</em>, saith<sup class="note" id="n419-ref">[419]</sup> Pliny, <em class="underline">in <a id="l4943"></a>infinitum possederant. Iam Cyrus devicta Asia</em> [auri] <em class="underline">pondo 34000 <a id="l4944"></a>millia invenerat, præter vasa aurea aurumque factum, &amp; in eo <a id="l4945"></a>folia ac platanum vitemque. Qua victoria argenti quingenta mil<a id="l4946"></a>lia talentorum reportavit, et craterem Semiramidis cujus pondo <a id="l4947"></a>quindecim talentorum colligebat. Talentum autem Ægyptium <a id="l4948"></a>pondo octoginta capere Varro tradit</em>. What the conqueror did with <a id="l4949"></a>all this gold &amp; silver appears by the Darics. The Lydians, according <a id="l4950"></a>to<sup class="note" id="n420-ref">[420]</sup> Herodotus, were the first who coined gold &amp; silver, and <em class="underline">Crœsus</em> <a id="l4951"></a>coyned gold monies in plenty called <em class="underline">Crœsei</em>, &amp; it was not reasonable <a id="l4952"></a>that the moneys of the Kings of Lydia should continue current after <a id="l4953"></a>the overthrow of their Kingdom, &amp; therefore Darius recoined it with his <a id="l4954"></a>own effigies, but without altering the current weight &amp; value. So then <a id="l4955"></a>he reigned from before the conquest of Sardes till after the conquest <a id="l4956"></a>of Babylon.</p>
<p id="par402">And since the cup of Semiramis was preserved till the conquest <a id="l4957"></a>of Crœsus by Darius: it is not probable that she could be older then <a id="l4958"></a>is represented by Herodotus.</p>
    <p id="par403">This conquest of the Kingdom of Lydia put the Greeks into fear <a id="l4959"></a>of the Medes. For Theognis who lived at Megara in the very times <a id="l4960"></a>of these wars, writes thus:</p>

<p id="par405" class="i0">The Poet tells us further that discord had destroyed Magnesia, Colophon, &amp; Smyrna, <a id="l4961"></a>cities of Ionia &amp; Phrygia, &amp; would destroy the Greeks: which is as much <a id="l4962"></a>as to say that the Medes had then conquered those cities.</p>
<p id="par406">The Medes therefore reigned till the taking of Sardes. And further <a id="l4963"></a>according to Xenophon &amp; the scriptures, they reigned till the taking <a id="l4964"></a>of Babylon. For Xenophon <sup class="note" id="n423-ref">[423]</sup> tells us that after the taking of Babylon <a id="l4965"></a>Cyrus went to the King of the Medes at Ecbatane &amp; succeeded him in <a id="l4966"></a>the Kingdome. And Ierome <sup class="note" id="n424-ref">[424]</sup> that Babylon was taken by Darius King <a id="l4967"></a>of the Medes &amp; his kinsman Cyrus. And the Scriptures tell us that Ba<a id="l4968"></a>bylon was destroyed by a nation out of the north (Ierem. L. 3, 9, 41) by <a id="l4969"></a>the Kingdoms of Ararat-Minni (or Armenia) &amp; Ashchenaz (or <a id="l4970"></a>Phrygia minor. Ier. LI. 27) by the Medes (Isa. XIII. 17, 19) by the <a id="l4971"></a>Kings of the Medes &amp; the captains &amp; rulers thereof &amp; all the land <a id="l4972"></a>of his dominion (Ier. LI. 11, 28.) The Kingdom of Babylon was numbred <a id="l4973"></a>&amp; finished &amp; broken &amp; given to the Medes &amp; Persians (Dan. V.) first <a id="l4974"></a>to the Medes under Darius, &amp; then to the Persians under Cyrus. For <a id="l4975"></a>Darius reigned over Babylon like a conqueror not observing the <a id="l4976"></a>laws of the Babylonians, but introducing the immutable laws of the <a id="l4977"></a>conquering nations the Medes &amp; Persians (Dan. VI. 8, 12, 15;) &amp; the <a id="l4978"></a>Medes in his reign are set before the Persians (Dan. ib. &amp; V. 28 &amp; <a id="l4979"></a>ch. VIII. 20.) as the Persians were afterwards in the reign of Cyrus <a id="l4980"></a>&amp; his successors set before the Medes (Esther I. 3, 14, 18, 19. Dan. X. <a id="l4981"></a>1, 20 &amp; XI. 2:) which shews that in the reign of Darius, the Medes <a id="l4982"></a>were uppermost.</p>
<p id="par407">You may know also by the great number of Provinces in the <a id="l4983"></a>Kingdom of Darius, that he was King of the Medes &amp; Persians. For upon <a id="l4984"></a>the conquest of Babylon, he set over the whole Kingdome an hundred <a id="l4985"></a>&amp; twenty Princes (Dan. VI. 1.) &amp; afterwards when Cambyses &amp; Darius <a id="l4986"></a>Hystaspis had added some new territories the whole conteined but <a id="l4987"></a>127 provinces.</p>
<p id="par408">The extent of the Babylonian Empire was much the same with <a id="l4988"></a>that of Nineveh after the revolt of the Medes. Berosus saith that <a id="l4989"></a>Nebuchadnezzar held Ægypt, Syria Phenicia &amp; Arabia. And Strabo <a id="l4990"></a>adds Arbela to the territories of Babylon; &amp; saying that Babylon <a id="l4991"></a>was anciently the Metropolis of Assyria, he thus describes the limits <a id="l4992"></a>of this Assyrian Empire. <em class="underline">Contiguous</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">to Persia &amp; Susia<a id="l4993"></a>na are the Assyrians. For so they call Babylonia &amp; the greatest <a id="l4994"></a>part of the region about it: part of which is Atturia (wherein <a id="l4995"></a>is Nineveh) &amp; Apolloniatis &amp; Chalonitis by the mountain Zagrus, &amp; <a id="l4996"></a>the fields neare Nineveh, &amp; Dolomena, &amp; Chalachena, &amp; Chazena, <a id="l4997"></a>&amp; Adiabena, &amp; the nations of Mesopotamia neare the Gordieans <a id="l4998"></a>&amp; the Mygdones about Nisibis unto Zeugma upon Euphrates, &amp; <a id="l4999"></a>a large region on this side Euphrates inhabited by the Arabians &amp; <a id="l5000"></a>Syrians properly so called as far as Cilicia &amp; Phœnicia &amp; Libya <a id="l5001"></a>&amp; the sea of Egypt &amp; the Sinus Issicus</em>. And a little after describing <a id="l5002"></a>the extent of the Babylonian region, he bounds it on the north with the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p095r"> &lt;95r&gt; </span> Armenians &amp; Medes unto the mountain Zagrus, on the east side <a id="l5003"></a>with Susa &amp; Elymais &amp; Paretica (inclusively,) on the south with the <a id="l5004"></a>Persian gulph &amp; Chaldea, &amp; on the west with the Arabes Scenitæ as <a id="l5005"></a>far as Adiabena &amp; Gordiæa. Afterwards speaking of Susiana &amp; <a id="l5006"></a>Sitacene a region between Babylon &amp; Susa, &amp; of Parætica &amp; Cossæa &amp; <a id="l5007"></a>Elymais, &amp; of the Sagapens &amp; Silocens, two little adjoining Provinces, <a id="l5008"></a>he concludes: <em class="underline">And these are the nations which inhabit Babylonia ~ <a id="l5009"></a>eastward. To the north are Media &amp; Armenia</em> [exclusively,] <em class="underline">&amp; west<a id="l5010"></a>ward are Adiabene &amp; Mesopotamia</em> [inclusively.] <em class="underline">The greatest part <a id="l5011"></a>of Adiabene is plane, the same being part of Babylonia. In same <a id="l5012"></a>places it borders on Armenia. For the Medes Armenians &amp; Babylo<a id="l5013"></a>nians warred frequently on one another</em>. Thus far Strabo.</p>
<p id="par409">When Cyrus took Babylon, he changed the Kingdom into a <a id="l5014"></a>Satrapy or Province: whereby the bounds were long after known. <a id="l5015"></a>And by this means Herodotus <sup class="note" id="n425-ref">[425]</sup> gives us an estimate of the bigness of <a id="l5016"></a>this Monarchy in proportion to that of the Persian, telling us that <a id="l5017"></a>whilst every region over which the King of Persia reigned in his days, <a id="l5018"></a>was distributed for the nourishment of his army, besides the tributes, <a id="l5019"></a>the Babylonian region nourished him four months of the twelve in the <a id="l5020"></a>year, &amp; all the rest of Asia eight. So the power of the region, saith <a id="l5021"></a>he, is equivalent to the third part of Asia, &amp; its principality (which <a id="l5022"></a>the Persians call a Satrapy) is far the best of all the Provinces.</p>
<p id="par410">Babylon <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n426-ref">[426]</sup> was a square city of 120 furlongs or 15 miles on every <a id="l5023"></a>side, compassed first with a broad &amp; deep ditch &amp; then with a wall <a id="l5024"></a>fifty cubits thick &amp; two hundred high. Euphrates flowed through <a id="l5025"></a>the middle of it southward a few leagues on this side Tigris. And in the <a id="l5026"></a>middle of one half westward stood the Kings new Palace built by <a id="l5027"></a>Nebuchadnezzar; &amp; in the middle of the other half stood the temple <a id="l5028"></a>of Belus with the old Palace between that temple &amp; the river. <a id="l5029"></a> This old Palace was built by the Assyrians <a id="l5030"></a>according to Isaiah <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n427-ref">[427]</sup>, &amp; by consequence by Pul &amp; his son Nabonassar <a id="l5031"></a> as above. They founded the city for the Arabians, &amp; set up <a id="l5032"></a>the towers thereof, &amp; built the palaces thereof. And at that time <a id="l5033"></a>Sabacon the Ethiopian invaded Egypt, &amp; made great multitudes of <a id="l5034"></a>Egyptians fly from him into Chaldea, &amp; carry thither their Astronomy <a id="l5035"></a>&amp; Astrology &amp; Architecture, &amp; the form of their year which they <a id="l5036"></a>preserved there in the Æra of Nabonassar. For the practice of <a id="l5037"></a> observing the stars began in Egypt in the days of Ammon as <a id="l5038"></a>above &amp; was propagated from thence in the reign of his son Sesac <a id="l5039"></a>into Afric Europe &amp; Asia by conquest; &amp; then Atlas formed the <a id="l5040"></a>sphere of the Libyans, &amp; Chiron that of the Greeks, &amp; the Chalde<a id="l5041"></a>ans also made a sphere of their own. But Astrology was <a id="l5042"></a>invented  in Egypt by Nichepsos one of the Kings <a id="l5043"></a>of the lower Egypt &amp; Petosiris his Priest a little before the days of <a id="l5044"></a>Sabacon, &amp; propagated thence into Chaldea, where Zoroaster the <a id="l5045"></a>legislator of the Magi met with it. So Paulinus:</p>
<div class="lg">

<p id="par411" class="i0">And Diodorus <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n428-ref">[428]</sup>: <em class="underline">They say that the Chaldæans in Babylonia are <a id="l5046"></a>colonies of the Egyptians, &amp; being taught by the Priests of Egypt <a id="l5047"></a>became famous for Astrology</em>. By the influence of the same colo<a id="l5048"></a>nies the temple of Iupiter Belus in Babylon seems to have been erected in <a id="l5049"></a>the form of the Egyptian pyramids. For <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n429-ref">[429]</sup> this temple was a solid <a id="l5050"></a>tower or Pyramid a furlong square &amp; a furlong high, with seven <a id="l5051"></a>retractions which made it appear like eight towers standing upon <a id="l5052"></a>one another &amp; growing less &amp; less to the top, and in the eighth tower was a temple  with a bed &amp; a golden <a id="l5053"></a>table kept by a woman after the manner of the Egyptians  in the temple of Iupiter Ammon at Thebes. And above <a id="l5055"></a>the Temple was a place for observing the stars.

<p id="par412">The Babylonians were extremely addicted to Sorcery, In<a id="l5058"></a>chantments, Astrology &amp; Divinations (Isa XLVII. 9, 12, 13. Dan. II. <a id="l5059"></a>2 &amp; V.

And when any woman was once sat <a id="l5076"></a>there, she was not to depart till some stranger threw money into <a id="l5077"></a>her bosome, took her away &amp; lay with her. And the money being for <a id="l5078"></a>sacred uses, she was obliged to accept of it how little soever, &amp; follow <a id="l5079"></a>the stranger.</p>
    <p id="par413">The Persians being conquered by the Medes about the middle of <a id="l5080"></a>the reign of Zedekiah, continued in subjection under them till <a id="l5081"></a>the end of the reign of Darius the Mede..

But after the taking of Babylon, when <a id="l5085"></a>he had a victorious army at his devotion, &amp; Darius was re<a id="l5086"></a>turned from Babylon into Media, he revolted from Darius in <a id="l5087"></a>conjunction with the Persians under him; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n430-ref">[430]</sup> they being incited <a id="l5088"></a>thereunto by Harpagus a Mede whom Xenophon calls Artagerses <a id="l5089"></a>&amp; Atabazus, &amp; who had assisted Cyrus in conquering Crœsus &amp; <a id="l5090"></a>Asia minor, &amp; had been injured by Darius.

<p id="par422">They went up from the priests court to the Porch of the <a id="l5269"></a>temple by ten steps.

Ezekiel represents the chambers a cubit narrower &amp; the <a id="l5285"></a>walls a cubit thicker then they were in Solomon's temple.

The <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n477-ref">[477]</sup>  Porch of the temple <a id="l5288"></a>was 120 cubits high &amp; its length from south to north equalled <a id="l5289"></a>the breadth of the house. The house was three stories high, <a id="l5290"></a>which made the height of the holy place three times thirty <a id="l5291"></a>cubits &amp; that of the most holy three times twenty. The uper <a id="l5292"></a>rooms were treasure chambers.

<p id="par423">Some time after this Temple was built the Iews <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n479-ref">[479]</sup> added a <a id="l5295"></a>new court on the eastern side of the Priests court before the Kings <a id="l5296"></a>gate, &amp; therein built <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n480-ref">[480]</sup> a covert for the sabbath. This court was <a id="l5297"></a>not measured by Ezekiel, but the dimensions thereof may be gather<a id="l5298"></a>ed from those of the weomens court in the second temple built after <a id="l5299"></a>the example thereof. For when Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed <a id="l5300"></a>the first Temple, Zerubbabel by the commissions of Cyrus &amp; <a id="l5301"></a>Darius, built another upon the same area, excepting the <a id="l5302"></a>outward court which was left open to the Gentiles. And this <a id="l5303"></a>temple <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n481-ref">[481]</sup> was sixty cubits long &amp; sixty broad, being only two <a id="l5304"></a>storys in height, &amp; having only one row of treasure chambers <a id="l5305"></a>about it. And on either side of the Priests court were double <a id="l5306"></a>buildings for the priests <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n482-ref">[482]</sup>, built upon three rows of marble pillars <a id="l5307"></a>in the lower story with a row of cedar beames or pillars in <a id="l5308"></a>the stories above. And the cloyster in the lower story looked <a id="l5309"></a>towards the priests court. And the separate place &amp; priests court <a id="l5310"></a>with their buildings on the north &amp; south sides, &amp; the weomens court <a id="l5311"></a>at the east end took up an area three hundred cubits long &amp; <a id="l5312"></a>two hundred broad, the altar standing in the center of the <a id="l5313"></a>whole. The weomens court was so named because the weomen <a id="l5314"></a>came into it as well as the men. There were galleries for the <a id="l5315"></a>weomen, &amp; the men worshipped upon the grownd below. And <a id="l5316"></a>in this state the second Temple continued all the reign of the <a id="l5317"></a>Persians; but afterwards suffered some alterations, especially <a id="l5318"></a>in the days of Herod.</p>

<p id="par428">Cyrus having translated the Monarchy to the Persians &amp; reigned <a id="l5384"></a>seven years, was succeeded by his son Cambyses who reigned seven years <a id="l5385"></a>&amp; five months, &amp; in the three last years of his reign subdued Egypt. <a id="l5386"></a>He was succeeded by Mardus or Smerdes the Magus who feigned <a id="l5387"></a>himself to be Smerdes the brother of Cambyses.</p>
    <p id="par429">Smerdes reigned seven months &amp; in the eighth month being <a id="l5388"></a>discovered was slain  with a great number of the Magi (For so <a id="l5389"></a>the Persians called their Priests) &amp; in memory of this the Perians <a id="l5390"></a>kept an anniversary day which they called, <em class="underline">The slaughter of the Magi</em>. <a id="l5391"></a>Then reigned Maraphus &amp; Artaphrnes a few days &amp; after them <a id="l5392"></a>Darius the son of Hystaspes the son of Arsamenes of the family of Achemenes a Persian,, being chosen King by the neighing of <a id="l5393"></a>his horse. Before he reigned his <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n485-ref">[485]</sup> name was Ochus. He seems on this occasion to have reformed the con<a id="l5394"></a>stitution of the Magi, making his father Hystaspes their Master <a id="l5395"></a>or Archimagus. For Porphyrius tells us <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n486-ref">[486]</sup> that <em class="underline">the Magi were <a id="l5396"></a>a sort of men so venerable amongst the Persians, that Darius <a id="l5397"></a>the son of Hystaspis wrote on the monument of his father</em> (a<a id="l5398"></a>mongst other things) <em class="underline">that he had been the Master of the <a id="l5399"></a>Magi</em>. <span class="hspac-n" title="1 character space left blank.">&nbsp;</span> In this reformation of the Magi, Hystaspis was assisted <a id="l5400"></a>by Zoroastres. So Agathias: <em class="underline">The Persians at this day say <a id="l5401"></a>simply that Zoroastres lived under Hystaspis</em>. And Apuleius: <a id="l5402"></a> <em class="underline">Pythagoram</em>, aiunt, <em class="underline">inter captivos Cambysæ regis</em> [ex Ægypto <a id="l5403"></a>Babylonem abductos] <em class="underline">doctores habuisse Persarum Magos et <a id="l5404"></a>præcipue Zoroastrem omnis divini 50. arcani Antistitem</em>. By <a id="l5405"></a>Zoroaster's conversing at Babylon he seems to have bor<a id="l5406"></a>rowed his skill from the Chaldeans For he was skilled <a id="l5407"></a>in Astronomy &amp; used their year. So Q. Curtius <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n487-ref">[487]</sup>: <a id="l5408"></a><em class="underline">Magi proximi patrium carmen canebant.

From his conversing in several places <a id="l5413"></a>he is recconed a Chaldæan, an Assyrian, a Mede, a Per<a id="l5414"></a>sian, a Bactrian. Suidas calls him <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n488-ref">[488]</sup> a  <em class="underline">Perso-Mede</em> <a id="l5415"></a>&amp; saith that he was <em class="underline">the most skilfull of Astronomers <a id="l5416"></a>&amp;  first author of the name of the Magi received among them</em>. <a id="l5417"></a>This skill in Astronomy he had doubtless from the Chalde<a id="l5418"></a>ans but Hystaspes travelled into India to be instructed by <a id="l5419"></a>the Gymnosophists : &amp; these two conjoyning their skill &amp; <a id="l5420"></a>authority instituted a new set of Priests or Magi &amp; instructed <a id="l5421"></a>them in such ceremonies &amp; mysteries of religion &amp; philo<a id="l5422"></a>sophy as they thought fit to establish for the religion &amp; philo<a id="l5423"></a>sophy of that Empire &amp; these instructed others till from a small <a id="l5424"></a> number they grew to a great multitude.

And Ammianus <sup class="note" id="n489-ref">[489]</sup> <a id="l5429"></a>tells us: <em class="underline">Magia divinorum incorruptissimum est cultus, cui sci<a id="l5430"></a>entiæ seculis priscis multa ex Chaldæorum arcanis Bactrianus <a id="l5431"></a>addidit Zoroastres: deinde Hystaspes prudentissimus Darij pater <a id="l5432"></a>qui quum superioris Indiæ secreta fidentius penetraret, ad ne<a id="l5433"></a>morosam quandam venerat solitudinem, cujus tranquillis silentijs <a id="l5434"></a>præcelsa Brachmanorum ingenia potiuntur, eorumque monitu <a id="l5435"></a>rationes mundani motus &amp; siderum, purosque sacrorum ritus <a id="l5436"></a>quantum colligere potuit, eruditus, ex his quæ didicit, aliqua <a id="l5437"></a>sensibus Magorum infudit; quæ illi cum disciplinis præsentiendi <a id="l5438"></a>futura, per suam quisque progeniem posteris ætatibus tradunt. <a id="l5439"></a>Ex eo per sæcula multa ad præsens una eademque prosapia <a id="l5440"></a>multitudo creata, deorum cultibus dedicatur.

So then <a id="l5452"></a>this Empire was at first composed of many nations each of which had hitherto <a id="l5453"></a>its own religion: but now Hystaspes &amp; Zoroaster collected what they <a id="l5454"></a>conceived to be best, established it by law &amp; taught it to others <a id="l5455"></a>&amp; those to others till their disciples became numerous enough for <a id="l5456"></a>the Priesthood of the whole Empire;  &amp; instead of those various old  religions set up their <a id="l5458"></a>own institutions in the whole Empire, much after the manner that <a id="l5459"></a>Numa contrived &amp; instituted the religion of the Romans. And this <a id="l5460"></a>religion of the Persian Empire was composed partly of the insti<a id="l5461"></a>tutions of the Chaldæans  in which Zoroaster was well skilled <a id="l5462"></a>&amp; partly of the institutions of the ancient Brachmans who are <a id="l5463"></a>supposed to derive even their name from the Abrahamans or <a id="l5464"></a>sons of Abraham born of his second wife Keturah, instructed <a id="l5465"></a>by their father in the worship of one God without images &amp; sent <a id="l5466"></a>into the east, where Hystaspes was instructed by their successors. About the <a id="l5467"></a>same time with Hystapes &amp; Zoroaster lived also Hostanes another <a id="l5468"></a>eminent Magus. Pliny places him under Darius Hystaspis &amp; <a id="l5469"></a>Suidas makes him the follower of Zoroastres. He came into Greece <a id="l5470"></a>with Xerxes &amp; seems to be the Hotanes of Herodotus who discovered <a id="l5471"></a>Smerdes &amp; formed the conspiracy against him, &amp; for the service <a id="l5472"></a>was honoured by the conspirators &amp; exempt from subjection <a id="l5473"></a>to Darius.</p>
<p id="par430">In the sacred commentary of the Persian rites these words  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p110r"> &lt;110r&gt; </span> are ascribed to Zoroaster. <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n490-ref">[490]</sup>.  <em class="underline">Deus est accipitris capite. Hic est <a id="l5474"></a>primus, incorruptibilis, æternus, ingenitus, sine partibus, <a id="l5475"></a>omnibus alijs dissimillimus, moderator omnis boni, donis non <a id="l5476"></a>capiendus, bonorum optimus, prudentium prudentissimus, <a id="l5477"></a>legum æquitatis ac justitiæ parens, ipse sui doctor, Phy<a id="l5478"></a>sicus &amp; perfectus et sapiens &amp; sacri Physici unicus inven<a id="l5479"></a>tor</em>. And the same was taught by Ostanes, in his book <a id="l5480"></a>called Octateuchus. This was the antient God of the Persian <a id="l5481"></a>Magi, &amp; they worshipped him by keeping a perpetual fire <a id="l5482"></a>for sacrifices upon an altar in the center of a round <a id="l5483"></a>area compassed with a ditch without any Temple in the <a id="l5484"></a>place &amp; without paying any worship to the dead, or any Images. But in a short time they declined from the worship <a id="l5485"></a>of this eternal invisible God, to worship the Sun &amp; the fire &amp; dead <a id="l5486"></a>men &amp; images as the Egyptians Phenicians &amp; Chaldeans <a id="l5487"></a>had done before. And from these superstitions &amp; the pretending <a id="l5488"></a>to prognostications, the words Magi &amp; Magia which signify the <a id="l5489"></a>Priests &amp; religion of the Persians, came to be taken in an ill <a id="l5490"></a>sense.</p>
<p id="par431">Darius (or Darab) began his reign in spring in the sixteenth year <a id="l5491"></a>of the Empire of the Persians, Anno Nabonass. 227,  &amp; reigned 36 years by the unanimous consent <a id="l5493"></a>of all Chronologers. In the second year of his reign the <a id="l5494"></a>Iews began to build the Temple by the prophesying of <a id="l5495"></a>Haggai &amp; Zechary, &amp; finished it in the sixt.

Nabonass. <a id="l5499"></a>263.  The years of Cambyses &amp; Darius are de<a id="l5500"></a>termined by three eclipses of the Moon recorded by Ptolomy, <a id="l5501"></a>so that they cannot be disputed. And by those Eclipses &amp; the <a id="l5502"></a>prophesies of Haggai &amp; Zechary compared together it is ma<a id="l5503"></a>nifest that the years of Darius began after the 24<sup>th</sup> day of <a id="l5504"></a> the eleventh Iewish month &amp; before the 25<sup>t</sup> day of <a id="l5505"></a>April, &amp; by consequence in March or April.</p>
<p id="par432">Xerxes (Achschirosch, Achsweros or Oxyares) succeeded his father Da<a id="l5506"></a>rius &amp; spent the first five years of his reign &amp; something <a id="l5507"></a>more in preparations for his expedition against the Greeks, <a id="l5508"></a>&amp; this expedition was in the time of the Olympic games, in the <a id="l5509"></a>beginning of the first year of the 75<sup>t</sup> Olympiad, Callias <a id="l5510"></a>being Archon at Athens as all Chronologers agree.

<p id="par437">I have hitherto stated the times of this Monarchy out of <a id="l5554"></a>the Greek &amp; Latin writers. For the Iews knew nothing more of <a id="l5555"></a>the Babylonian &amp; Medo-Persian Empires than what they have out <a id="l5556"></a>of the sacred books of the old Testament &amp; therefore own no <a id="l5557"></a>more kings nor years of kings than they can find in those books. <a id="l5558"></a>The kings they reccon are only Nebuchadnezzar, Evilmerodach, <a id="l5559"></a>Belshazzar, Darius the Mede, Cyrus, Ashuerus, &amp; Darius the Persian. <a id="l5560"></a>This last Darius they reccon to be the Artaxerxes in whose reign <a id="l5561"></a>Ezra &amp; Nehemiah came to Ierusalem, accounting Artaxerxes a <a id="l5562"></a>common name of the Persian kings. Nebuchadnezzar, they say, reigned <a id="l5563"></a>45 years (2 King. 25. 27) Belshazzar 3 (Dan. 8. 1) &amp; therefore Evilme<a id="l5564"></a>rodach 23 to make up the seventy years captivity, excluding [the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p112r"> &lt;112r&gt; </span> first year of Nebuchadnezzar in which they say the Prophesy <a id="l5565"></a> of the seventy years was given. To Darius the Mede <a id="l5566"></a>they assigne one year or at most but two (Dan 9. 1) to Cyrus <a id="l5567"></a>three years incomplete (Dan. 10. 1) to Ahasuerus 12 years <a id="l5568"></a>till the casting of Pur (Esth. 3. 7) one year more till the <a id="l5569"></a>Iews smote their enemies (Esth. 9. 1) &amp; one year more till <a id="l5570"></a>Esther &amp; Mordecai wrote the second letter for the keeping <a id="l5571"></a>of Purim (Esth. 9. 29) in all 14 years, &amp; to Darius the Persian <a id="l5572"></a>they allot 32 or rather 36 years (Nehem. 13. 6) so that the <a id="l5573"></a>Persian Empire from the building of the Temple in the <a id="l5574"></a>second year of Darius Hystaspis flourished only 34 years <a id="l5575"></a>untill Alexander the great overthrew it. Thus the <a id="l5576"></a>Iews reccon in their greater Chronicle Seder Olam Rabbah. <a id="l5577"></a>Iosephus out of the sacred &amp; other books reccons only these <a id="l5578"></a>kings of Persia, Cyrus, Cambyses, Darius Hystaspis, Xerxes, Ar<a id="l5579"></a>taxerxes  &amp; Darius: and taking this Darius, who was Da<a id="l5580"></a>rius Nothus, to be one &amp; the same king with the last Darius whom <a id="l5581"></a>Alexander the great overcame, by means of this recconing he <a id="l5582"></a>makes Sanballat &amp; Iadua alive when Alexander the great <a id="l5583"></a>overthrew the Persian Empire. Thus all the Iews conclude <a id="l5584"></a>the Persian Empire with Artaxerxes Longimanus &amp; Darius <a id="l5585"></a>Nothus, allowing no more kings of Persia than they found in <a id="l5586"></a>the books of Ezra &amp; Nehemiah, &amp; referring to the reigns of <a id="l5587"></a>this Artaxerxes &amp; this Darius whatever they met with in <a id="l5588"></a>profane history concerning the following kings of the same <a id="l5589"></a>names, so as to take Artaxerxes Longimanus, Artaxerxes <a id="l5590"></a>Mnemon &amp; Artaxerxes Ochus for one &amp; the same Artaxerxes <a id="l5591"></a>&amp; Darius Nothus &amp; Darius Codomannus for one &amp; the same <a id="l5592"></a>Darius, &amp; Iaddua &amp; Simeon Iustus for one &amp; the same <a id="l5593"></a>High Priest. <span class="ns">☉</span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the middle of f 112v &gt; </span><span class="ns">☉</span> Those Iews who took Herod for the Messiah, and were thence called Herodians, seem to have grounded their opinion upon the seventy weeks of years, which they found between the Reign of Cyrus and that of Herod: but afterwards, in applying the Prophesy to Theudas, and Iudas of Galilee, and at length to Barchochab, they seem to have shortned the Reign of the Kingdom of Persia.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 112r resumes &gt; </span> These accounts being very imperfect, it was <a id="l5594"></a>necessary to have recourse to the records of the Greeks &amp; <a id="l5595"></a>Latines &amp; to the Canon recited by Ptolemy, for stating the times of this  Empire. <a id="l5596"></a>Which being done, We have a better grownd for understanding <a id="l5597"></a>the history of the Iews set down in the books of Ezra &amp; Nehe<a id="l5598"></a>miah, &amp; adjusting it.

<p id="par438">This history is conteined partly in the three first <a id="l5602"></a>chapters of the book of Ezra &amp; first five verses of the <a id="l5603"></a>fourth, &amp; partly in the book of Nehemiah from the 5<sup>t</sup> <a id="l5604"></a>verse of the seventh chapter to the 9<sup>th</sup> verse of the twelft. <a id="l5605"></a>For Nehemiah copied all this out of the Chronicles of the <a id="l5606"></a>Iews written before his days, as may appear by reading the place &amp; considering that <a id="l5607"></a>the Priests &amp; Levites who sealed the Covenant on the 24<sup>th</sup> <a id="l5608"></a>day of the seventh month (Nehem. 10) were the very <a id="l5609"></a>same with those who returned from captivity in the first year <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p113r"> &lt;113r&gt; </span> of Cyrus (Nehem. 12) &amp; that all those who returned sealed <a id="l5610"></a>it.

<p id="par439">The Levites Ieshua Kadmiel &amp; Hodaviah or Iudah here mentioned <a id="l5612"></a>are recconed chief fathers among the people who returned <a id="l5613"></a>with Zerubbabel (Ezra. 2. 40) &amp; they assisted as well in <a id="l5614"></a>laying the foundation of the Temple (Ezra. 3. 9) as in read<a id="l5615"></a>ing the Law &amp; making &amp; sealing the covenant. Nehem 8. 7 &amp; <a id="l5616"></a>9. 5. &amp; 10. 9, 10.</p>
<p id="par440">Comparing therefore the books of Ezra &amp; Nehemiah <a id="l5617"></a>together, the history of the Iews under Cyrus, Cambyses <a id="l5618"></a>&amp; Darius Hystaspis is, that [they returned from captivity under <a id="l5619"></a>Zerubbabel, in the first year of Cyrus, with the holy Vessels <a id="l5620"></a>&amp; a commission to build the Temple, &amp; came to Ierusalem &amp; <a id="l5621"></a>Iudah every one to his city, &amp; dwelt in their cities till <a id="l5622"></a>the seventh month, &amp; then coming to Ierusalem they <a id="l5623"></a>first built the altar &amp; on the first day of the seventh <a id="l5624"></a>month began to offer the daily <a id="l5625"></a>burnt offerings &amp; read in the <a id="l5626"></a>book of the law, &amp; they kept a solemn fast &amp; sealed a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p114r"> &lt;114r&gt; </span> covenant, &amp; thenceforward the Rulers of the people dwelt <a id="l5627"></a>at Ierusalem &amp; the rest of the people cast lots to dwell one in <a id="l5628"></a>ten at Ierusalem &amp; the rest in the cities of Iudah. And in <a id="l5629"></a>the second year of their coming, in the second month (which <a id="l5630"></a>was six years before the death of Cyrus) they laid the <a id="l5631"></a>foundation of the Temple, but the adversaries of Iudah <a id="l5632"></a>troubled them in building &amp; hired counsellours against them <a id="l5633"></a>all the days of Cyrus, &amp; longer, even untill the reign of Darius king of Persia. <a id="l5634"></a>But in the second year of his reign by the prophesying of Haggai <a id="l5635"></a>&amp; Zechary they returned to the work &amp; by the help of a new Decree <a id="l5636"></a>from Darius, finished it on the third day of the month Adar in the <a id="l5637"></a>sixt year of his reign &amp; kept the Dedication with joy &amp; the Passover <a id="l5638"></a>&amp; feast of unleavened bread.</p>
<p id="par441">Now this Darius was not Darius Nothus but Darius Hystaspis <a id="l5639"></a>as I gather by considering that the second year of this Darius was <a id="l5640"></a>the seventith of the indignation against Ierusalem &amp; the cities of <a id="l5641"></a>Iudah, which indignation commenced with the invasion of Ierusalem <a id="l5642"></a>&amp; the cities of Iudea by Nebuchadnezzar in the ninth year of <a id="l5643"></a>Zedekiah (Zech. I. 12. Ier. xxxiv. 1, 7, 22, &amp; xxxix. 1) and that the fourth <a id="l5644"></a>year of this Darius was the seventith from the burning of the <a id="l5645"></a>Temple in the eleventh year of Zedekiah (Zech. vii. 5. &amp; Ier. LII. 12) <a id="l5646"></a>both which are exactly true of Darius Hystaspis; and that in the second year <a id="l5647"></a>of this Darius there were men living who had seen the first <a id="l5648"></a>Temple (Haggai II. 3) whereas the second year of Darius Nothus <a id="l5649"></a>was 166 years after the desolation of the Temple &amp; City. And <a id="l5650"></a>further, if the finishing of the Temple be deferred to the sixt <a id="l5651"></a>year of Darius Nothus, Ieshua &amp; Zerubbabel must have <a id="l5652"></a>been the one High Priest, the other Captain of the people, <a id="l5653"></a>an hundred &amp; eighteen years together, besides their ages before; <a id="l5654"></a>which is surely too long. For in the first year of Cyrus the <a id="l5655"></a>chief Priests were Serajah, Ieremiah, Ezra, Amariah, Malluc, <a id="l5656"></a>Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, Iddo, Ginetho, Abijah, Miamin, <a id="l5657"></a>Maadiah, Bilgah, Shemajah, Iojarib, Iedaiah, Sallu, Amock, <a id="l5658"></a>Hilkiah, Iedaiah. These were Priests in the days of Ieshua, <a id="l5659"></a>&amp; the eldest sons of them all  (Merajah the <a id="l5660"></a>son of Serajah, Hananiah the son of Ieremiah, Meshullam <a id="l5661"></a>the son of Ezra, &amp;c) were chief Priests in the days of Ieho<a id="l5662"></a>jakim the son of Ieshua (Nehem. xii) &amp; therefore the High-<a id="l5663"></a>Priesthood of Ieshua was but of an ordinary length.</p>
<p id="par442">[I have now stated the history of the Iews in the reign of Cyrus <a id="l5664"></a>Cambyses &amp; Darius Hystaspis: it remains that I state their history <a id="l5665"></a>in the reigns of Xerxes &amp; Artaxerxes Longimanus. For I place the <a id="l5666"></a>history of Ezra &amp; Nehemiah in the reign of this Artaxerxes &amp; not <a id="l5667"></a>in that of Artaxerxes Mnemon. For during all the Persian Monarchy <a id="l5668"></a>untill the last Darius mentioned in scripture, whom I take to be Darius <a id="l5669"></a>Nothus, there were but six High Priests in continual succession of <a id="l5670"></a>father &amp; son, namely Ieshua, Iojakim, Eliasib, Iojada, Iohanen, <a id="l5671"></a>Iadua, &amp; the seventh  High Priest was Onias the son of Iaddua, &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p115r"> &lt;115r&gt; </span> the eighth was Simeon Iustus the son of Onias &amp; the ninth was <a id="l5672"></a>Eliezer the younger brother of Simeon. Now, at a mean <a id="l5673"></a>recconing we should allow about 27 or 28 years only to a ge<a id="l5674"></a>neration by the eldest sons of a family (one generation with <a id="l5675"></a>another) as above, but if in this case we  allow 30 years <a id="l5676"></a>to a generation &amp; may further suppose that Ieshua at the <a id="l5677"></a>return of the captivity in the first year of the Empire <a id="l5678"></a>of the Persians was about 30 or 40 years old: Iojakim will <a id="l5679"></a>be of about that age in the 16<sup>th</sup> year of Darius Hystaspis, <a id="l5680"></a>Eliasib in the tenth year of Xerxes, Iojada in the 19<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l5681"></a>of Artaxerxes Longimanus, Iohanan in the 8<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l5682"></a>Darius Nothus, Iaddua in the 19<sup>th</sup> year of Artaxerxes <a id="l5683"></a>Mnemon, Onias in the 3<sup>d</sup> year of Artaxerxes Ochus, &amp; Simeon <a id="l5684"></a>Iustus two years before the death of Alexander the great. And <a id="l5685"></a>this recconing, as it is according to the course of nature so <a id="l5686"></a>it agrees perfectly well with history. For thus Eliasib <a id="l5687"></a>might be High Priest &amp; have grandsons before the seventh <a id="l5688"></a>year of Artaxerxes Longimanus (Ezra x. 6) &amp; without exceeding <a id="l5689"></a>the age which many old men attain unto, continue High <a id="l5690"></a>Priest till after the 32<sup>th</sup> year of that king (Nehem. xiii. <a id="l5691"></a>6, 7) <sup>⭗</sup><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 114v &gt; </span>⭗ &amp; his grandson Iohanan might have a chamber in the Temple <a id="l5692"></a>in the seventh year of  that king (Ezra x. 6) &amp; be High <a id="l5693"></a>Priest before Ezra wrote the sons of Levi in the book of Chronicles <a id="l5694"></a>(Nehem. xii. 23) &amp; in his High-priesthood slay his  younger brother Iesus <a id="l5695"></a>in the Temple before the end of the reign of  Artaxerxes Mnemon (Ioseph. <a id="l5696"></a>Antiq. l. xi. c. 7) &amp; Iaddua might be High Priest before the death of <a id="l5697"></a>Sanballat (Ioseph. ib) &amp; before the death of Nehemiah (Nehem. xii. 22) <a id="l5698"></a>&amp; also before the end of the reign of Darius Nothus, &amp; thereby give <a id="l5699"></a>occasion to Iosephus &amp; the later Iews who took this king for the last <a id="l5700"></a>Darius to fall into an opinion that Sanballat Iaddua &amp; Manasses the <a id="l5701"></a>younger brother of Iaddua lived till the end of the reign of the last <a id="l5702"></a>Darius (Ioseph. Antiq. l. xi. c. 7, 8) &amp; the said Manasses might marry  <a id="l5703"></a>Nicaso the daughter of Sanballat &amp; for that offence be chased from <a id="l5704"></a>Nehemiah before the end of the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus <a id="l5705"></a>(Nehem. xiii. 28. Ioseph. Antiq. l. xi. c. 7, 8) &amp; Sanballat might at that <a id="l5706"></a>time be Satrapa of Samaria &amp; in the reign of Darius Nothus or soon <a id="l5707"></a>after build the Temple of the Samaritans in mount Gerizim for his <a id="l5708"></a>son in law Manasses the first High Priest of that Temple (Ioseph <a id="l5709"></a>ib.) &amp; Simeon Iustus might be High Priest when the Persian Empire <a id="l5710"></a>was invaded by Alexander the great as the Iews represent (Ioma fol. <a id="l5711"></a>69. 1. Liber Iuchasis. R. Gedaliah &amp;c) &amp; for that reason he taken by some <a id="l5712"></a>of the Iews for the same High Priest with Iaddua ( <a id="l5713"></a>&amp; be dead sometime before the book of Ecclesiasticus was writ in Hebrew  at Ierusalem, by the grandfather of him who <a id="l5714"></a>in the 38<sup>th</sup> year of the Egyptian Æra of Dionysius, that is <a id="l5715"></a>in the 77<sup>th</sup> year after the death of Alexander the great <a id="l5716"></a>met with a copy of it in Egypt &amp; there translated it into <a id="l5717"></a>Greek (Ecclesiast. c. 50 &amp; in Prologo) &amp; Eliezer the younger brother<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 115r resumes &gt; </span>  &amp; successor <a id="l5730"></a>of Simeon might cause the Law to be translated into Greek <a id="l5731"></a>in the beginning [of the reign of Ptolemæus Philadelphus <a id="l5732"></a>(Ioseph. Antiq. l. xii. c. 2) and Onias the son of Simeon Iustus <a id="l5733"></a>who was a child at his fathers death &amp; by consequence was <a id="l5734"></a>born in his fathers old age might be so old in the reign of <a id="l5735"></a>Ptolomæus Euergetes as to have his follies excused to that king <a id="l5736"></a>by representing that he was then grown childish with old age <a id="l5737"></a>(Ioseph. Antiq. l. xii. c. 4.) In this manner the actions of all these <a id="l5738"></a>High Priests suit with the reigns of the Kings without any strain<a id="l5739"></a>ing from the course of nature: and according to this recconing <a id="l5740"></a>the days of Ezra &amp; Nehemiah fall in with the reign of the first <a id="l5741"></a>Artaxerxes: For Ezra &amp; Nehemiah flourished in the High Priest<a id="l5742"></a>hood of Eliasib (Ezra x. 6. Nehem. iii. 1. &amp; xiii. 4, 28.) But if Eliasib Ezra &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p116r"> &lt;116r&gt; </span> Nehemiah be placed in the reign of the second Artaxerxes, <a id="l5743"></a>since they lived beyond the 32<sup>th</sup> year of  Artaxerxes (Nehem. <a id="l5744"></a>xiii. 28) there must be at least 160 years allotted to the three <a id="l5745"></a>first High Priests &amp; but 42 to the four or five last, a division <a id="l5746"></a>too unequal. For the High Priesthoods of Ieshua, Iojakim <a id="l5747"></a>&amp; Eliasib were but of an ordinary length, that of Ieshua <a id="l5748"></a>fell in with one generation of the chief Priests, &amp; that of <a id="l5749"></a>Iehojakim with the next generation (as we have shewed <a id="l5750"></a>already) &amp; that of Eliasib fell in with the third genera<a id="l5751"></a>tion. For at the dedication of the wall Zechariah the <a id="l5752"></a>son of Ionathan the son of Shemaiah was one of the Priests <a id="l5753"></a>(Nehem. xii. 35) &amp; Ionathan &amp; his father Shemaiah were con<a id="l5754"></a>temporaries to Iojakim &amp; his father Ieshua (Nehem xii. 6, 18) <a id="l5755"></a>I observe further that in the first year of Cyrus, Ieshua &amp; <a id="l5756"></a>Bani or Binnui were chief fathers of the Levites (Nehem. <a id="l5757"></a>viii. 10. &amp; Ezra II. 4 &amp; III. 9) &amp; that Iozabad the son of Ieshua <a id="l5758"></a>&amp; Noadiah the son of Binnui were chief Levites in the se<a id="l5759"></a>venth year of Artaxerxes when Ezra came to Ierusalem <a id="l5760"></a>(Ezra viii. 33) so that this Artaxerxes began his reign before <a id="l5761"></a>the end of the second generation. And that he reigned in the <a id="l5762"></a>time of the third generation is confirmed by two instances <a id="l5763"></a>more. For Meshullam the son of Berechiah the son of <a id="l5764"></a>Meshezabeal, &amp; Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah were fathers of their houses at the repairing <a id="l5765"></a>of the wall (Nehem. III. 4, 23) &amp; their grandfathers [Mesha<a id="l5766"></a>zabeel &amp; Hananiah subscribed the covenant in the reign <a id="l5767"></a>of Cyrus (Nehem. x. 21, 23.) Yea Nehemiah, this same <a id="l5768"></a>Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah was the Tirshatha &amp; sub<a id="l5769"></a>scribed it (Nehem. x. 1 &amp; viii. 9 &amp; Ezra ii. 2, 63) &amp; therefore in <a id="l5770"></a>the 32<sup>th</sup> year of Artaxerxes Mnemon he will be above <a id="l5771"></a>180 years old, an age surely too great. The same may be <a id="l5772"></a>said of Ezra, if he was that Priest &amp; Scribe who read the <a id="l5773"></a>Law Nehem. viii. For he is the son of Serajah the son <a id="l5774"></a>of Azariah the son of Hilkiah the son of Shallum &amp;c (Ezra <a id="l5775"></a>vii. 1) &amp; this Serajah went into captivity at the burning <a id="l5776"></a>of the Temple &amp; was there slain (1 Chron. vi. 14. 2 King. <a id="l5777"></a>xxv. 18) &amp; from his death to the twentieth year of Artax<a id="l5778"></a>erxes Mnemon is above 200 years, an age too great for Ezra.</p>
<p id="par443">I consider further that Ezra (Chap. IV.) names Cyrus, <a id="l5779"></a>*, Darius, Achasuerus &amp; Artaxerxes in continual order <a id="l5780"></a>as successors to one another, &amp; these names agree to Cyrus, <a id="l5781"></a>*, Darius Hystaspis, Xerxes &amp; Artaxerxes Longimanus, <a id="l5782"></a>&amp; to no other Kings of Persia. Some take this Artaxerxes <a id="l5783"></a>to be not the successor but the predecessor of Darius Hystaspis, <a id="l5784"></a>not considering that in his reign the Iews were busy in <a id="l5785"></a>building the City &amp; the wall (Ezra iv. 12) &amp; by consequence <a id="l5786"></a>had finished the Temple before. Ezra describes first how the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p117r"> &lt;117r&gt; </span> people of the land hindered the building of the Temple all the <a id="l5787"></a>days of Cyrus &amp; further till the reign of Darius, &amp; after <a id="l5788"></a>the Temple was built, how they hindered the building of the City <a id="l5789"></a>in the reign of Achsuerus &amp; Artaxerxes, &amp; then returns <a id="l5790"></a>back to the story of the Temple in the reign of Cyrus &amp; Darius. <a id="l5791"></a>And this is confirmed by comparing the book of Ezra with the <a id="l5792"></a>book of Esdras. For if in the book of Ezra you omit the <a id="l5793"></a>story of Achsuerus &amp; Artaxerxes &amp; in that of Esdras you <a id="l5794"></a>omit the same story of Artaxerxes &amp; that of the three <a id="l5795"></a>wise men, the two books will agree: &amp; therefore the  Book <a id="l5796"></a>of Esdras  if you except the story of the three wise men, <a id="l5797"></a>was originally copied from authentic writings of sacred <a id="l5798"></a>authority. Now the story of Artaxerxes which (with that <a id="l5799"></a>of Achsuerus) in the book of Ezra interrupts the story of <a id="l5800"></a>Darius, doth not interrupt it in the book of Esdras, but is <a id="l5801"></a>there inserted into the story of Cyrus between the first &amp; second chapter of Ezra, and all the rest of the story of <a id="l5802"></a>Cyrus &amp; that of Darius is told in the book of Esdras in con<a id="l5803"></a>tinual order without any interruption. So that the Darius which <a id="l5804"></a>in the book of Ezra precedes Achsuerus &amp; Artaxerxes <a id="l5805"></a>&amp; the Darius which in the same book follows them, is, by <a id="l5806"></a>the book of Esdras, one &amp; the same Darius: &amp; I take <a id="l5807"></a>the book of Esdras to be the best interpreter of the <a id="l5808"></a>book of Ezra. So then the Darius mentioned between <a id="l5809"></a>Cyrus &amp; Achsuerus is Darius Hystaspis, &amp; therefore <a id="l5810"></a>Achsuerus &amp; Artaxerxes who succeed him are Xerxes <a id="l5811"></a>&amp; Artaxerxes Longimanus, &amp; the Iews who came up <a id="l5812"></a>from Artaxerxes to Ierusalem &amp; began to build the <a id="l5813"></a>City &amp; the Wall (Ezra iv. 13) are Ezra with his compani<a id="l5814"></a>ons. Which being understood, the history of the Iews <a id="l5815"></a>in the reign of those kings will be as follows.</p>
<p id="par444">After the Temple was built &amp; Darius Hystaspis <a id="l5816"></a>was dead, the enemies of the Iews in the beginning of the <a id="l5817"></a>reign of his successor Achsuerus or Xerxes wrote unto <a id="l5818"></a>him an accusation against them (Ezra iv. 6.) but in the <a id="l5819"></a>seventh year of his successor Artaxerxes, Ezra &amp; his <a id="l5820"></a>companions went up from Babylon with offerings &amp; vessels <a id="l5821"></a>for the Temple &amp; power to bestow on it out of the kings <a id="l5822"></a>treasure what should be requisite (Ezra vii.) Whence <a id="l5823"></a>the Temple is said to be finished according to the com<a id="l5824"></a>mandment of Cyrus &amp; Darius &amp; Artaxerxes king of <a id="l5825"></a>Persia Ezra vi. 14. Their commission was also to set <a id="l5826"></a>magistrates and Iudges over the land, &amp; thereby becoming <a id="l5827"></a>a new body politique, they called a great Council or Sanhedrim <a id="l5828"></a>to separate the people from strange wives; &amp; they were also <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p118r"> &lt;118r&gt; </span> encouraged to attempt the building of Ierusalem with its wall. <a id="l5829"></a>And thence Ezra saith in his prayer that <em class="underline">God had extended mercy <a id="l5830"></a>unto them in the sight of the kings of Persia, &amp; given them a re<a id="l5831"></a>viving to set up the house of their God &amp; to repair the desolations <a id="l5832"></a>thereof, &amp; to give them a WALL in Iudah, even in Ierusalem</em> <a id="l5833"></a>Ezra ix. 9. But when they had begun to repair the wall, their <a id="l5834"></a>enemies wrote against them to Artaxerxes: <em class="underline">Be it known</em>, say they, <a id="l5835"></a><em class="underline">unto the king that the Iews who came up from thee to us, are <a id="l5836"></a>come up to Ierusalem, building the rebellious &amp; bad city, &amp; have <a id="l5837"></a>set up the walls thereof &amp; joined the foundations</em>. &amp;c. And the <a id="l5838"></a>king wrote back that the Iews should cease &amp; the city not be <a id="l5839"></a>built untill another commandment should be given from him. <a id="l5840"></a>Whereupon their enemies went up to Ierusalem &amp; made them <a id="l5841"></a>cease by force &amp; power. Ezra iv. But in the twentith year of <a id="l5842"></a>the king, Nehemiah hearing that the Iews were in great <a id="l5843"></a>affliction &amp; distress, &amp; that the wall of Ierusalem (that <a id="l5844"></a>wall which had been newly repaired by Ezra) was broken <a id="l5845"></a>down &amp; the gates thereof burnt with fire; he obteined <a id="l5846"></a>leave of the king to go &amp; build the city &amp; the Governours <a id="l5847"></a>house (Nehem. i. 3 &amp; ii. 6, 8, 17.) And coming to Ierusalem the <a id="l5848"></a>same year, he continued Governour twelve years, &amp; built <a id="l5849"></a>the wall. And being opposed by Sanballat Tobiah &amp; Geshem <a id="l5850"></a> he persisted in the work <a id="l5852"></a>with great resolution &amp; patience untill the breaches were <a id="l5853"></a>made up. Then Sanballat &amp; Geshem sent messengers unto <a id="l5854"></a>him five times to hinder him from setting up the doors upon <a id="l5855"></a>the Gates: but notwithstanding he persisted in the work till <a id="l5856"></a>the doors were also set up. So the wall was finished in the <a id="l5857"></a>eight &amp; twentith year of the king (Ioseph. Antiq. l. xi. c. 5) in <a id="l5858"></a>the five &amp; twentith day of the month Elul (or sixt month) <a id="l5859"></a>in fifty &amp; two days after the breaches were made up, &amp; <a id="l5860"></a>they began to work upon the Gates. While the timber for <a id="l5861"></a>the Gates was preparing &amp; seasoning, they made up the <a id="l5862"></a>breaches of the wall. Both were works of time &amp; are <a id="l5863"></a>not jointly to be recconed within the 52 days. This is the <a id="l5864"></a>time of the last work of the wall, the work of setting up <a id="l5865"></a>the Gates after the timber was seasoned &amp; the breaches <a id="l5866"></a>made up. And when he had set up the Gates, he dedicated <a id="l5867"></a>the wall with great solemnity, &amp; appointed Officers over <a id="l5868"></a>the chambers for the treasuries, for the offerings, for the <a id="l5869"></a>first fruits &amp; for the tiths to gather into them out of the fields <a id="l5870"></a>of the cities the portions appointed by the law for the Priests &amp; <a id="l5871"></a>Levites. And the singers &amp; the Porters kept the ward of their <a id="l5872"></a>God (Nehem xii) But the people in the city were but few, <a id="l5873"></a>&amp; the houses were unbuilt (Nehem. vii. 1, 4.) And in this <a id="l5874"></a>condition he left Ierusalem in the 32<sup>th</sup> year of the <a id="l5875"></a>king; &amp; after some time returning back from the King <a id="l5876"></a>he reformed such abuses as had been committed in his ab<a id="l5877"></a>sence (Nehem. xiii) In the mean time the genealogies of the Priests &amp; <a id="l5878"></a>Levites were recorded in the book of the Chronicles in the <a id="l5879"></a>days of Eliasib Ioiada, Ionathan &amp; Iaddua untill the reign of the next <a id="l5880"></a>king Darius Nothus, whom Nehemiah calls Darius the Persian. <a id="l5881"></a>Nehem. xii. 11, 22, 23. whence it follows that Nehemiah was <a id="l5882"></a>Governour of the Iews  till  the <a id="l5883"></a>reign of Darius Nothus. And here ends the sacred history of the Iews.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p119r"> &lt;119r&gt; </span>
<p id="par445">The histories of the Persians now extant in the east <a id="l5884"></a>represent that the oldest Dynasties of the kings of Persia, were <a id="l5885"></a>those whom they call Pischdadians &amp; Kaianides, &amp; that the Dynasty <a id="l5886"></a>of the Kaianides immediately succeeded that of the Pischdadians. <a id="l5887"></a>They derive the name Kaianides from the word Kai, which, they <a id="l5888"></a>say, in the old Persian language signified a Giant or great <a id="l5889"></a>King. And they call the first four kings of this Dynasty Kai-Cobad, <a id="l5890"></a>Kai-Caus, Kai-Cosroes, &amp; Lohorasp, &amp; by Lohorasp mean Kai-Axeres, or <a id="l5891"></a>Cyaxeres. For they say that Lohorasp was the first of their kings <a id="l5892"></a>who reduced their armies to good order &amp; discipline, &amp; Herodotus <a id="l5893"></a>affirms the same thing of Cyaxeres. And they say further that <a id="l5894"></a>Lohorasp went eastward &amp; conquered many Provinces of Persia <a id="l5895"></a>&amp; that one of his Generals whom the Hebrews call Nebuchadnezzar, <a id="l5896"></a>the Arabians Bocktanassar, &amp; others Raham &amp; Gudars, went <a id="l5897"></a>westward &amp; conquered all Syria &amp; Iudea &amp; took  the <a id="l5898"></a>city Ierusalem &amp; destroyed it. They s<a id="l5899"></a>wars. The fift king of this Dynasty they call Kischtasp &amp; <a id="l5900"></a>by this name meane sometimes Darius  Medus &amp; sometimes <a id="l5901"></a>Darius Hystaspes. For they say that he was contemporary to <a id="l5902"></a>Ozair or Ezra &amp; to Zaradust or Zoroastres the legislator of the <a id="l5903"></a>Ghebers or Fire worshippers, &amp; established his doctrines throughout <a id="l5904"></a>all Persia &amp; here they take him for Darius Hystaspes. They <a id="l5905"></a>say also that he was contemporary to Ieremiah &amp; to Daniel <a id="l5906"></a>&amp; that he was the son &amp; successor of Lohorasp, &amp; here they <a id="l5907"></a>take him for Darius the Mede. The sixt king of the Kaianides <a id="l5908"></a>they call Bahaman, &amp; tell us that Bahaman was Ardschir <a id="l5909"></a>Diraz, that is Artaxerxes Longimanus so called from the <a id="l5910"></a>great extent of his power: And yet they say that Bahaman <a id="l5911"></a>went westward into Mesopotamia &amp; Syria &amp; conquered Bal<a id="l5912"></a>thazar the son of Nebuchadnezzar, &amp; gave the kingdom to <a id="l5913"></a>Cyrus his Lieutenant general over Media: &amp; here they take <a id="l5914"></a>Bahaman for Darius Medus. Next after Ardschir Diraz <a id="l5915"></a>they place Homai a Queen, the mother of Darius Nothus, <a id="l5916"></a>tho' really she did not reign. And the two next &amp; last <a id="l5917"></a>kings of the Kaianides they call Darab the bastard son of <a id="l5918"></a>Ardschir Diraz &amp; Darab who was conquered by Ascander <a id="l5919"></a>Roumi, that is Darius Nothus &amp; Darius who was conquered <a id="l5920"></a>by Alexander the Greek. And the kings between these two <a id="l5921"></a>Dariuses they omit, as they do also Cyrus Cambyses &amp; Xerxes. <a id="l5922"></a>The Dynasty of the Kaianides was therefore that of the <a id="l5923"></a>Medes &amp; Persians, beginning with the defection of the Medes <a id="l5924"></a>from the Assyrians in the end of the reign of Sennacherib, <a id="l5925"></a>&amp; ending with the conquest of Persia by Alexander the great. <a id="l5926"></a>But their account of this Dynasty is very imperfect some <a id="l5927"></a>kings being omitted &amp; others being confounded with one another. <a id="l5928"></a>And their chronology of this Dynasty is still worse. For to the <a id="l5929"></a>first king of this Dynasty they assign a reign of  120 years, <a id="l5930"></a>to the second a reign of 150 years, to the third a reign of <a id="l5931"></a>60 years, to the fourth a reign of 120 years, to the fift as <a id="l5932"></a>much, &amp; to the sixt a reign of 112 years.</p>
<p id="par446">This Dynasty being the Monarchy of the Medes &amp; Persi<a id="l5933"></a>ans; the Dynasty of the Pischdadians which immediately pre<a id="l5934"></a>ceded it, must be that of the Assyrians. And according to the <a id="l5935"></a>oriental historians this was the oldest kingdom in the world, some of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p120r"> &lt;120r&gt; </span> its kings living a thousand years a-piece, &amp; one of them reign<a id="l5936"></a>ing five hundred years, another seven hundred years, another <a id="l5937"></a>a thousand years.</p>
<p id="par447">So then we need not wonder that the Egyptians have made <a id="l5938"></a>the kings in the first Dynasty of their Monarchy, (that which was <a id="l5939"></a>seated at Thebes in the days of David, Solomon, &amp; Rehoboam) <a id="l5940"></a>so very ancient &amp; so long lived; since the Persians have <a id="l5941"></a>done the like to their kings who began to reigne in Assyria two hun<a id="l5942"></a>dred years after the death of Solomon &amp; the Syrians of <a id="l5943"></a>Damascus have done the like to their Kings Adar &amp; Hazael <a id="l5944"></a>who reigned an hundred years after the death of Solomon, <a id="l5945"></a>worshipping them as Gods &amp; boasting their antiquity &amp; not <a id="l5946"></a>knowing, saith Iosephus, that they were but modern.</p>
<p id="par448">And whilst all these nations have magnified their <a id="l5947"></a>Antiquities so exceedingly, we need not wonder that the <a id="l5948"></a>Greeks &amp; Latins have  made their first kings a little <a id="l5949"></a>older than the truth.</p>
