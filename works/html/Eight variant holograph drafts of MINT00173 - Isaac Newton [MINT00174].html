    <p id="par1" class="cent"><span class="large">Of the assaying of Gold &amp; Silver, the making of <a id="l1"></a>indented Triall-pieces, &amp; trying the moneys in <a id="l2"></a>the Pix.</span> <br><br></p>
    
    <p id="par2" class="cent"><span class="large">1. Of the Assay</span> <br><br></p>
    
    <p id="par3">Assaying &amp; refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer <a id="l3"></a>refines a small piece of any mass of Gold or Silver, &amp; by the decrease <a id="l4"></a>of its weight makes his report. And if there be no decrease, that is, if the mass <a id="l5"></a>be of the same fineness with the refined Assay-piece, he reports (or ought to <a id="l6"></a>report) the gold 24 carats fine &amp; the silver 12 ounces fine. And this is fine <a id="l7"></a>gold &amp; fine silver in the sense of the law. And all gold &amp; silver of the same <a id="l8"></a>fineness with the Assay piece is fine gold &amp; fine silver in the sense of the <a id="l9"></a>law. And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule then the Refiner <a id="l10"></a>&amp; makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the standing universal Rule of <a id="l11"></a>valuing gold &amp; silver in all nations in point of fineness, &amp; the Law in ordein<a id="l12"></a>ing that standard gold shall be 22 carats fine &amp; standard silver 11 ounces two <a id="l13"></a>penny weight fine, means by the Assay.</p>
    
    <p id="par4">The assays of gold ought to be made with two waters &amp; no more, this being <a id="l14"></a>the constant practise of assaying, &amp; the waters ought to be of the usual strength <a id="l15"></a>(the second water stronger then the first) &amp; to work the usual time &amp; in the <a id="l16"></a>usual heat, &amp; the Assay piece ought to be hammered to the usuall thinness <a id="l17"></a>that the Assays may be uniform. And the Assays of silver ought to be made <a id="l18"></a>with a due proportion of Lead in a due &amp; eaven heat, &amp; as soon as the lead is <a id="l19"></a>blown off &amp; the silver looks bright &amp; glittering, the silver must begin to cool <a id="l20"></a>without roasting it, &amp; it must cool slowly that it do not spring. But in refining <a id="l21"></a>gold &amp; silver in great quantities these niceties are not observed</p>
    
    <p id="par5">Assays are liable to errors, but the errors are generally very small <a id="l22"></a>&amp; seldome exceed a quarter of a grain in gold &amp; an halfpenny weight in <a id="l23"></a>silver. And by reason of these little errors the Assayer in single Assays makes <a id="l24"></a>his report to no less then a quarter of a grain in gold &amp; an half penny weight <a id="l25"></a>in silver. But if two or more assays be made of the same piece of gold or of <a id="l26"></a>the same piece of silver, &amp; the assays agree without any considerable difference <a id="l27"></a>&amp; a medium be taken between them, the fineness of the Gold may be determi<a id="l28"></a>ned to less then half a quarter of a grain &amp; the fineness of the silver to less <a id="l29"></a>an half penny weight. And this is the exactest way of assaying hitherto in use</p>
    
    <p id="par6" class="cent"><span class="large">2. Of making the Indented Trial-pieces.</span></p>
    
    <p id="par7">The standard Trial pieces are made by the Assay. First a Iury of <a id="l30"></a>workmen summoned &amp; sworn by Order of Council procures gold &amp; silver refined <a id="l31"></a>by the Refiner, &amp; assays them to see if they be of a just degree of fineness, that <a id="l32"></a>is, the gold just 24 carats fine &amp; the silver just 12 ounces fine. Then they melt <a id="l33"></a>this gold &amp; silver severally with allay in due proportion &amp; stir them well toge<a id="l34"></a>ther in fusion several times to mix them very well with the Allay, &amp; pour <a id="l35"></a>them off before the Allay evaporates, &amp; then assay them several times to <a id="l36"></a>see if they be standard, taking assays from several places to see if the mixture <a id="l37"></a>be uniform. It must agree therefore with the assay as exactly as is possible <a id="l38"></a>least there be two standards, one by the Assay-weights, the other by the Trial-piece</p>
    
    <p id="par8">Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 carats. They <a id="l39"></a>seldome make it above 23<sup>car</sup> 3<sup>gr</sup> 3<sup>qters</sup> fine, &amp; by fine gold generally understand <a id="l40"></a>gold of this <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>degree<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of fineness.

The Pix is opened &amp; the Iury sworn before <a id="l59"></a>the Queen or such of her Council as her Majesty shall appoint. If the triall <a id="l60"></a>pieces be exactly made the trial thereby is the most expedite &amp; the least <a id="l61"></a>liable to errors or fallacy.

    <p id="par11">If at any time the Trial piece doth not agree with the Assay, either <a id="l67"></a>the error must be reported by the Iury or it must not be reported.

    <p id="par17" class="i15">1 Of the assay.</p>
    
    <p id="par18">1 Assaying &amp; refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer refines <a id="l90"></a>a small piece of any mass of gold or silver, &amp; by the decrease of its weight makes <a id="l91"></a>his report. And if there be no decrease, that is, if the mass be of the <a id="l92"></a>same fineness with the refined Assay-piece, he reports (or ought to report) <a id="l93"></a>it two carats better then standard or twenty &amp; four carats fine if it be <a id="l94"></a>gold, or twelve ounces fine if it be silver. And this is fine gold or fine silver <a id="l95"></a>in the sense of the law. And all gold &amp; silver in the sense of the law is <a id="l96"></a>fine gold &amp; fine silver if it be of the same fineness with the Assay-piece <a id="l97"></a>And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule then the Refiner <a id="l98"></a>&amp; makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the standing universal Rule <a id="l99"></a>of valuing gold &amp; silver in all nations in point of fineness, &amp; the law in <a id="l100"></a>ordeining that standard Gold shall be 22 carats fine &amp; standard silver <a id="l101"></a>11 ounces two penny weight fine, means by the assay.</p>
    
    <p id="par19">2. The assays of Gold ought to be made with two waters &amp; no more, <a id="l102"></a>this being the constant practise of assaying, &amp; the waters ought to be of the <a id="l103"></a>usual strength (the second water stronger then the first,) &amp; to work the <a id="l104"></a>usual time, &amp; in the usual heat, &amp; the Assay-piece ought to be hammer<a id="l105"></a>ed to the usual thinness that the Assays may be uniform. And the assays <a id="l106"></a>of silver ought to be made with a due proportion of Lead in a due &amp; eaven <a id="l107"></a>heat, &amp; as soon as the Lead is blown off &amp; the silver looks bright &amp; glitter<a id="l108"></a>ing, the silver must begin to cool without roasting it, &amp; it must cool <a id="l109"></a>slowly it do not spring. But in refining gold &amp; silver in great <a id="l110"></a>quantities these niceties are not observed.</p>
    
    <p id="par20">5 Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 carats. <a id="l111"></a>They seldome make it above 23 carats 3 grains &amp; 3 quarters of a grain <a id="l112"></a>fine, &amp; by fine gold generally understand gold of this degree of fineness. <a id="l113"></a>And if gold at any time prove finer upon the Assay, Assayers out of prejudice do not <a id="l114"></a>report it finer. And thence it comes to pass that Goldsmiths are ge<a id="l116"></a>nerally of opinion that gold cannot be above 24 carats fine, not knowing <a id="l117"></a>that there are ways of making it finer then by the assay. <sup>†</sup>

    <p id="par21">3. Assays are liable to errors, but the errors are generally very <a id="l125"></a>small &amp; seldome exceed a quarter of a grain in gold or an halfpenny eight <a id="l126"></a>in silver. And by reason of these little errors the Assayer in single assays makes <a id="l127"></a>his reports to no less parts then a quarter of a grain in gold &amp; an half penny weight <a id="l128"></a>in silver. But if two or more assays be made of the same piece of gold or <a id="l129"></a>of the same piece of silver, &amp; the assays agree without any considerable <a id="l130"></a>difference &amp; a medium be taken between them: the fineness of the gold <a id="l131"></a>may be determined to less then half a quarter of a grain, &amp; the fineness <a id="l132"></a>of the silver to less then half an half penny weight. And this is the exactest <a id="l133"></a>way of assaying hitherto in use</p>

    <p id="par23">4. The standard Trial pieces are made by the assay. First the Iury <a id="l134"></a>procures gold &amp; silver refined by the Refiner &amp; assays then to see if <a id="l135"></a>they be of a just degree of fineness, that is, the gold just 24 carats fine <a id="l136"></a>&amp; the silver just 12 ounces fine. Then they melt this gold &amp; silver sever<a id="l137"></a>ally with allay in due proportion, &amp; stir them well together in fusion several <a id="l138"></a>times to mix them very well, &amp; pour them off before the allay evaporates, &amp; then <a id="l139"></a>assay them several times to see if they be standard, taking assays from <a id="l140"></a>several places to see if the mixture be uniform? They must agree there<a id="l141"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p244v"> &lt;244v&gt; </span>fore with the assay as exactly as is possible least there be two stan<a id="l142"></a>dards, one by the Assay-weights the other by the Trial-pieces.</p>

If the Trial piece be exactly made, the trial thereby <a id="l146"></a>is the most expedite &amp; the least liable to errors.

    <p id="par26">7. If at any time the Trial-piece doth not agree with the assay <a id="l153"></a>either the error must be reported by the Iury or it must not be <a id="l154"></a>reported.

    <p id="par48">Assaying &amp; Refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer <a id="l267"></a>refines a small piece of  any mass of gold or silver &amp; by the decrease <a id="l268"></a>of weight makes his report; &amp; if there be no decrease, that is, if the mass <a id="l269"></a>be of the same fineness with the Assay piece, he reports it  <a id="l270"></a>two carats better then standard, or twenty &amp; four carats fine, &amp; this is fine <a id="l271"></a>gold in the sense of the law.  The Assay piece therefore, when the <a id="l272"></a>Assayer works exactly, becomes fine gold or fine silver in the sense of the <a id="l273"></a>law. And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule then the <a id="l274"></a>Refiner,  &amp; makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the standing  <a id="l275"></a>universal rule of valuing gold &amp; silver in point of fineness, &amp; the Law <a id="l276"></a>in ordeining that standard Gold shall be 22 carats fine &amp; standard <a id="l277"></a>silver eleven ounces two  penny weight fine, means by the assay.</p>
    
    <p id="par49">The standard Trial pieces are made by the Assay. First the <a id="l278"></a>Iury procures  gold &amp;  silver refined  by the Refiner, &amp; then <a id="l279"></a>assays the same to see if they be of a just degree of fineness, that  is, <a id="l280"></a>the gold just two carats better then standard &amp; the silver just 18 penny <a id="l281"></a>weight better. And when the Trial pieces are made, the Iury assays <a id="l282"></a>them several times to see if they be standard.</p>
    
    <p id="par50">The assays of gold ought to be made with two waters &amp; no more <a id="l283"></a>this being  the constant practise of assaying, &amp; the waters ought to be of <a id="l284"></a>the usual strength &amp; to work the usual time &amp; in the  usual heat, &amp; <a id="l285"></a>the Assay piece ought to be hammered to the usual thinness that the <a id="l286"></a>assays may be uniform.</p>
    
    <p id="par51">Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 carats. They <a id="l287"></a>seldome make it above 23 carats 3 grains &amp; three quarters of a grain fine <a id="l288"></a>And by fine gold understand  gold of this degree of fineness And thence it comes  to pass that the Goldsmiths are generally of opinion <a id="l289"></a>that  gold cannot be above 24 carats fine. <a id="l290"></a>But if when they have watered their granulated Gold once or <a id="l291"></a>twice with Aqua fortis, they should dulcify it &amp; grind it very fine <a id="l292"></a>as painters do their colours &amp; then water it once or twice more <a id="l293"></a>with double Aqua fortis in the same degree of heat as before, <a id="l294"></a>&amp; keep it longer in the water then before, stirring it now &amp; <a id="l295"></a>then with a wooden stick to make the gold mix with fresh water the <a id="l296"></a>Gold will become finer then by the Assay, &amp; by consequence <a id="l297"></a>finer then four &amp; twenty carats. Chymists also tell us that Gold <a id="l298"></a>may be made finer by Antimony then by Aqua fortis, &amp; by <a id="l299"></a>consequence then by the Assay; but the Goldsmiths know not <a id="l300"></a>how to refine Gold by Antimony.</p>
    
    <p id="par52">If Refiners should work perfectly in the same manner <a id="l301"></a>with Assayers, that is, if they should mix gold with silver in <a id="l302"></a>the same proportion &amp; drive it off the Test with the same pro<a id="l303"></a>portion of lead &amp; hammer it to the very same thinness &amp; water <a id="l304"></a>it with waters of the  same strength in the same degree <a id="l305"></a>of heat during the same length of time, their gold would become <a id="l306"></a>just 24 carats fine. But they work not  with so much curiosity &amp; eaveness.</p>
    
    <p id="par53">The tryal of the moneys in the Pix is to be performed after <a id="l308"></a>the most just manner that can be made by fire by water by

        touch or by weight or by all or by any of them. If the Trial <a id="l309"></a>pieces be made exactly the trial thereby is the most expedite <a id="l310"></a>&amp; the least  liable to errors. But a Trial piece may happen <a id="l311"></a>to be erronus,  &amp; then other ways <a id="l312"></a>of Assaying may be also usefull. For the assay by the Assay weights <a id="l313"></a> exactly made will discover the error of the tryal piece, if <a id="l314"></a>there be any &amp; how great that error is.</p>
    
    <p id="par54"> At the last trial of the Pix the Iury by the Assay found the money standard <a id="l315"></a>&amp; the Trial piece  a quarter of a grain better then the money  &amp; reported  in their Veredict that the money was a quarter of a grain wors <a id="l317"></a>then standard by the Trial piece.

    <p id="par55"> When I came first to the Mint &amp; for some years before, the Importers <a id="l322"></a>were allowed the advantage of almost all the remedy, &amp; then the Gold imported <a id="l323"></a>made about four pounds &amp; two pence per ounce standard. The Goldsmiths now complain <a id="l324"></a>that their Gold doth not make 4<sup>li</sup> per ounce. It should make only three <a id="l325"></a>pounds nineteen shillings &amp; eight pence three farthings, &amp; so much it hath <a id="l326"></a>made ever since the last triall of the Pix.</p>
    
    <p id="par56">While the Importers were allowed the advantage of almost all <a id="l327"></a>the Remedy, there  wanted about 30 grains of fine gold <a id="l328"></a>in four &amp; forty Guineas &amp; an half, &amp; as much or more fine silver in sixty &amp; two <a id="l329"></a>shillings. There is now the just quantity of gold &amp; silver in the moneys <a id="l330"></a>&amp; there wants only about the third part of a grain of copppy in a Guinea <a id="l331"></a>which want is of no value or consequence being less then the thousandth part of a  penny in a Guinea &amp; is occasioned by the  <a id="l332"></a>want of so much allay in the gold Trial piece:</p>
    
    <p id="par57" class="i0">They must agree therefore with the Assay as exactly as is possible least there be two standards. <a id="l333"></a>And therefore whenever  the assay of the money by the Assay weights <a id="l334"></a>differs from that by the Triall piece, the difference ought to be reported</p>
    
    <p id="par58"> The Assays of Silver ought to be made with a due proportion of lead <a id="l335"></a>in a due &amp; eaven heat &amp; as soon as the lead is block off the silver must be<a id="l336"></a>gin to cool  without roasting it, &amp; it must cool slowly that it do <a id="l337"></a>not spring.   Then the Assay piece becomes 12 ounces <a id="l339"></a>fine: And if  after the  lead is blown off, fresh lead <a id="l340"></a>be added two or three times &amp; the assay piece be well roasted after all <a id="l341"></a>the lead is blown off, the silver will become still finer but not a half penny weight

In refining Gold <a id="l342"></a>&amp; silver in great quantities, the niceties above described in making assays, <a id="l343"></a>are not observed, &amp; therefore the Refiners fine Gold &amp; fine silver must be <a id="l344"></a>assayed to know how fine they are.</p>
    
    <p id="par59">And if the Refiner in refining silver should in all circumstances <a id="l345"></a>observe the Assayers rules &amp; proportions, his silver would become  12 ounces <a id="l346"></a>fine. But Refiners  work not with so much curiosity <a id="l347"></a>&amp; eavenness. Their fine gold &amp; fine silver must be assayed to know <a id="l348"></a>the just degree of fineness.</p>
    
    <p id="par60">The Trial piece is made by melting 11 ounces of fine gold with <a id="l349"></a>one ounce of copper allay &amp; 11 ounces 2<sup>dw<sup>t</sup></sup> of fine silver with 18 <a id="l350"></a>penny weight of copper allay &amp; keeping the mixture in fusion <a id="l351"></a>20 or 30 minutes &amp; in the mean time stirring it severall times to mix the metalls <a id="l352"></a>very well &amp; then pouring it off</p>

    <p id="par107">1. If the Trial pieces are too fine they occasion a discouragement  <a id="l548"></a> to the merchant &amp; others which import gold &amp; silver as answers to the excess of <a id="l549"></a>fineness,  &amp; therefore the triall pieces should rather err in defect of <a id="l550"></a>fineness then in excess, &amp; forreign nations chuse rather to err in defect.</p>
    
    <p id="par108">2.  By fine gold &amp; fine silver is to be understood such gold as is 24 carats fine <a id="l551"></a>by the Assay, &amp;  such silver as is 12 ounces <a id="l552"></a>fine by the Assay. And by standard gold &amp; silver is to be understood such <a id="l553"></a>gold as is 22 carats fine by the Assay &amp; such  silver as is 11<sup>oz</sup> 2<sup>dwt</sup> <a id="l554"></a>fine by the Assay. And in  judging of the fineness of the gold or silver <a id="l555"></a>there ought to be several Assays made as well successively as  <a id="l556"></a>at once  to see if the errors of the Assays which happen in excess <a id="l557"></a>be equal to the errors which happen in deffect.  For such errors will <a id="l558"></a>happen, &amp; a medium between them is to be taken.</p>
    
    <p id="par109">3. If the fine gold or silver be not fully fine by the assay, it may be roasted <a id="l559"></a>to make it finer &amp; if the Refiner hath made it too fine, it may be <a id="l560"></a>allayed to   make it coarser, to the end that the standard  by <a id="l561"></a>the Trial pieces may be the same with the standard by the Assay. For <a id="l562"></a>otherwise there will be two standards, one by the Assay &amp; another by the <a id="l563"></a>Trial piece. The French &amp; Spaniards seem to take such fine gold as is commonly <a id="l564"></a>made by the Refiners Art without roasting it. For their moneys are a <a id="l565"></a>little coarser then the just standard. Its safer to err a little in coarsness then <a id="l566"></a>in fineness because the metal will refine a lttle in the fire in melting the gold &amp; allay together</p>
    
    <p id="par110">4. To every eleven ounces of fine gold  must be added one ounce <a id="l567"></a>of fine copper &amp; to every eleven ounces two penny weight of fine <a id="l568"></a>silver must be added  18 penny weight of fine copper, &amp; when the <a id="l569"></a>gold or silver is well melted the copper must be put into the pot &amp; <a id="l570"></a>soon as that is also  melted, the metalls much be nimbly stirred toge<a id="l571"></a>ther once &amp; again to mixt them well &amp; when they have stood in little on the fire to <a id="l572"></a>mix  them sufficiently they must be poured to let
    
    
    
    without letting them stay longer on the fire then is necessary to mix them <a id="l573"></a>well least the allay should evaporate in too great a quantity.</p>
    
    <p id="par111">5 After the metal is  poured off it must be  assayed again severall <a id="l574"></a>times, &amp; if the Iury think fit they may cause it to be assayed <a id="l575"></a>by several hands for their greater satisfaction And for greater <a id="l576"></a>security &amp; satisfaction to her Majesty &amp; people they may cause it to be assayed also by <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>t<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <br><br></p>

And by consequence whether fine gold be not <a id="l581"></a>such gold as is 24 carats fine by the Assay, &amp; as is skilfully refined  without roasting the gold or using more then two waters <br><br></p>
    
    <p id="par113"> gold  is gold refined by the Refiners art <a id="l583"></a>after the very same manner  in a great quantity that it is <a id="l584"></a>refined by the Assayers Art in a small quantity; the gold being <a id="l585"></a>mixed with silver in the same proportion  in both cases &amp; laminated to the same  <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>thick<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>nes in both cases &amp; <a id="l586"></a>watered &amp; with the same heat &amp; length of operation in both cases, that it may become of the same degree <a id="l587"></a>of fineness in both cases, &amp; by consequence 24 carats fine. If <a id="l588"></a> the Refiner make the gold thinner or use stronger water <a id="l589"></a>or pour upon the gold oftener them the Assayer doth  he <a id="l590"></a>will make gold finer then the Assayer doth that is finer then  <a id="l591"></a>24 carats And if he refine it by <span class="ns">♁</span> it will become still finer. But if the Refiner  makes the gold not so then as the Assayer doth or pour on <a id="l592"></a>water but once or use weaker water or a less quantity, thereof, the gold <a id="l593"></a>will  not  become so fine as by the Assay that is not <a id="l594"></a>fully 24 carats fine.  And because the Refiner uses not to be of the paying &amp; charges of making his gold so fine as  in <a id="l596"></a>great quantity as it is made by the Assayer in small quantity thence it comes to pass that gold <a id="l597"></a>24 carats  fine is scarce to be met with  &amp; that the Iury who makes the tryal <a id="l598"></a>piece  roasts the Refiners gold to make it 24 carats fine by the Assay. <a id="l599"></a>  And when the  fine gold is mixed <a id="l601"></a>with Allay in due proportion to make the Trial piece, the Iury assay it <a id="l602"></a>again several times to see if it be standard. The Assay therefore is the <a id="l603"></a>fundamental as well as the universal rule of valuing gold &amp; silver in point <a id="l604"></a>of fineness,  And because Assayers <a id="l609"></a>by constant practise are better  skilled in refining gold to a certain <a id="l610"></a>degree by the Assay then Refiners are in refining it to a certain <a id="l611"></a>degree by the Art of Refining, therefore the  Refiners Art is not trusted alone <a id="l612"></a>in making fine gold, but the gold is examined by the Assay before it be <a id="l613"></a>adjudged to be  exactly 24 carats fine.</p>

    <p id="par115" class="cent">1 Of the assay.</p>
    
    <p id="par116">Assaying &amp; refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer <a id="l615"></a>refines a small piece of any mass of gold or silver &amp; by the decrease <a id="l616"></a>of its weight makes his report. And if there be no decrease, that is, <a id="l617"></a>if the mass  be of the same fineness with the refined Assay-piece, <a id="l618"></a>he reports (or ought to  report) the gold 24 carats fine &amp; the silver 12 ounces fine.  <a id="l620"></a>And this is fine  gold &amp; fine silver in the sense of the law. And all <a id="l621"></a>gold &amp; silver is fine gold &amp; fine silver in the sense of the law if <a id="l622"></a>it be of the same fineness with the Assay-piece. And because the <a id="l623"></a>Assayer works more exactly to a Rule then the Refiner &amp; makes better dispatch, <a id="l624"></a>the Assay is made the standing universal Rule of  valuing gold <a id="l625"></a>&amp; silver in all nations in point of fineness, &amp; the Law in ordeining <a id="l626"></a>that standard gold shall be 22 carats fine &amp; standard silver 11 <a id="l627"></a>ounces two  penny weight fine, means by the assay.</p>
    
    <p id="par117">The assays of Gold ought to be made with two waters &amp; no more, <a id="l628"></a>this being  the constant practise of assaying, &amp; the waters ought to be of <a id="l629"></a>the usual strength  (the second water stronger then the first) &amp; to work <a id="l630"></a>the usual time &amp; in the  usual heat, &amp; the Assay-piece ought to be <a id="l631"></a>hammered to the usuall thinness that the Assays may be uniform. And the <a id="l632"></a>assays of silver ought to be made with a due proportion of Lead in a due &amp; eaven <a id="l633"></a>heat, &amp; as soon as the Lead is  blown off, &amp; the silver looks bright &amp; glittering, <a id="l634"></a>the silver must begin to cool without roasting it, &amp; it must cool slowly <a id="l635"></a>that it do not spring. But in refining  gold &amp; silver in great quantities <a id="l636"></a>these niceties are not  observed</p>
    
    <p id="par118">Assays are liable to errors, but the errors are generally very small <a id="l637"></a>&amp; seldome exceed a quarter of a grain in gold or an halfpenny weight <a id="l638"></a>in  silver. And by reason of these little errors, the Assayer in single <a id="l639"></a>Assays makes  his report to no less then a quarter of a grain in gold <a id="l640"></a>&amp; an half-penny weight  in silver. But if two or more assays be made <a id="l641"></a>of the same piece of gold or of the same piece of silver, &amp; the assays <a id="l642"></a>agree without any considerable difference  &amp; a medium be taken be<a id="l643"></a>tween them: the fineness of the gold may be determined to less then <a id="l644"></a>half a quarter of a grain &amp; the fineness of the silver to less then half an <a id="l645"></a>half penny weight. And this is the exactest way of assaying hitherto in <a id="l646"></a>use.</p>
    
    <p id="par119" class="cent">2 Of making the Triall-pieces.</p>
    
    <p id="par120">The standard Triall-pieces are made by the Assay.

Then they melt this gold <a id="l650"></a>&amp; silver severally with allay in due proportion &amp; stirr them well together <a id="l651"></a>in fusion severall times to mix them very well,  &amp; pour them off before the <a id="l652"></a>Allay evaporates, &amp; then assay them severall times to  see if they be <a id="l653"></a>standard, taking assays from several places to see if the mixture  be uniform<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l654"></a>It must agree therefore with the assay as exactly as is possible  least <a id="l655"></a>there be two standards, one by the assay-weights, the other by the Trial-piec<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span></p>

    <p id="par121">Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 <a id="l656"></a>carats. They  seldome make it above 23 carats 3 grains 3 quarters of <a id="l657"></a>a grain fine, &amp; by fine gold generally understand  gold of this degree of <a id="l658"></a>fineness. And if gold at any time prove finer upon the Assay, Assayers <a id="l659"></a>out of prejudice do not report it finer. And thence it comes  to pass <a id="l660"></a>that Goldsmiths are generally of opinion that gold cannot be above <a id="l661"></a>24 carats fine, not knowing that there are ways of making it finer <a id="l662"></a>then by the assay. Thence also it may have sometimes happened <a id="l663"></a>that at the making of new Trial-pieces the Assayer may have <a id="l664"></a>reported the fine gold not so fine as it really was, &amp; by that means <a id="l665"></a>the Trial piece may have been made too fine. And  if the fine <a id="l666"></a>gold was by 23<sup>car.</sup> 3<sup>gr.</sup> 3<sup>qters</sup> fine, the Trial piece may have been <a id="l667"></a>made too coarse. And there are other ways of  erring as by assaying <a id="l668"></a>after any unusual manner, or by scattering any part of the allay or <a id="l669"></a>of the  gold or suffering a sensible quantity of the allay to evaporate <a id="l670"></a>or not mixing  the gold with the allay very well, or using a faulty <a id="l671"></a>crucible.</p>
    
    <p id="par122" class="cent">3 Of trying the Pix.</p>

        after the <a id="l672"></a>most just manner that can be made by fire by water by touch  or by <a id="l673"></a>weight or by all or by any of them, as is exprest in the Indenture  <a id="l674"></a>of the Mint The Pix is opened &amp; the Iury sworn before her Majesty or such of her Council as her Lordship shall  appoint. If the Triall  pieces be exactly made the trial thereby is <a id="l675"></a>the most expedite &amp; the least  liable to errors. But a Trial piece <a id="l676"></a>may happen to be erroneous &amp; then the other ways of assaying, as <a id="l677"></a>they are lawfull, so also they  may be usefull. For the Assay by <a id="l678"></a>the Assay weights exactly performed will discover the error of the <a id="l679"></a>Trial piece if there be any, &amp; how great that error  is, &amp; the Assay <a id="l680"></a>by the touch may be also used to see how it agrees with the  other Assays, <a id="l681"></a>but it is be less exact &amp; not to be depended upon alone.</p>
    
    <p id="par124">3 If at any time the Trial-piece doth not agree with the Assay, <a id="l682"></a>either  the error must be reported by the Iury or it must not be reported.  <a id="l683"></a>If it  be reported, either the Master of the Mint must be authorized to <a id="l684"></a>allow for the error in coining the money by that Trial piece for the <a id="l685"></a>future or  a new Trial piece must be made. If it  must not be reported <a id="l686"></a>the Master must go on to coin the money by an erroneous Trial piece, &amp; <a id="l687"></a>the  Goldsmiths must have it in their power to alter the standard without <a id="l688"></a>controll as often as they are to make a new Trial-piece, &amp; to make a <a id="l689"></a>new standard instead of making a new Trial piece agreeable to  the <a id="l690"></a>standard established by law.</p>
    
    <p id="par125">2 At the last trial of the Pix the gold money was standard full <a id="l691"></a>by the  Assay, &amp; the Trial piece a quarter of a grain better then the <a id="l692"></a>money, &amp; the Iury in their Veredict represented the money a quarter <a id="l693"></a>of a grain  worse then standard  by the Trial piece. . This Trial <a id="l694"></a>piece was made  A.C. 1707 it was made (I think) without the Queens order  &amp; by my Assays very <a id="l695"></a>carefully made is five twelfts of a grain  better then standard, that of 1688 <a id="l696"></a> made by order of King Iames II  is a  sixt part of a grain better then stan<a id="l697"></a>dard, &amp; that of 1660 made by  order of King Charles II is standard. <br><br></p>
    
    <p id="par126">Quære 1. If upon trying the Pix, the Trial-piece at any  time doth <a id="l698"></a>not  agree with the Assay, whether are not the Iury to  report the error? <br><br></p>

    <p id="par129">Assaying &amp; refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer <a id="l702"></a>refines a small piece of any mass of gold or silver &amp; by the decrease of <a id="l703"></a>its weight makes his report. And if there be no decrease, that is, if the <a id="l704"></a>mass be of the same fineness with the refined Assay-piece, he reports <a id="l705"></a>(or ought to  report) it two carats better then standard, or twenty &amp; <a id="l706"></a>four carats fine: &amp; this is fine gold in the sense of the Law. The Assay-<a id="l707"></a>piece therefore when the Assayer works exactly becomes fine gold or <a id="l708"></a>fine silver in the sense of the Law. And all gold &amp; silver in the <a id="l709"></a>sense of the law is fine gold &amp; fine silver if it be of the same <a id="l710"></a>fineness with the Assay-piece. And because the Assayer works more <a id="l711"></a>exactly to a rule then the Refiner, &amp; makes better dispatch, the Assay <a id="l712"></a>is made the standing universal  Rule of  valuing gold &amp; silver in <a id="l713"></a>all nations in point of fineness, &amp; the Law in ordeining that <a id="l714"></a>standard Gold shall be 22 carats fine &amp; standard silver 11 ounces <a id="l715"></a> two  penny weight fine, means by the Assay.</p>
    
    <p id="par130">The assays of gold ought to be made with two waters &amp; no <a id="l716"></a>more, this being the constant practise of assaying; &amp; the waters <a id="l717"></a>ought to be of the usual strength  (the second water stronger then <a id="l718"></a>the first) &amp; to work the usual time &amp; in the  usual heat, &amp; the assay piece <a id="l719"></a>ought to be hammered to the usual thinness  that the Assays may be <a id="l720"></a>uniform.

But if when they have watered their <a id="l732"></a>granulated gold once or twice with Aqua fortis, they should dulcify it &amp; <a id="l733"></a>grind it very fine as painters do their colours, &amp; then water it once <a id="l734"></a>or twice more with double Aqua fortis in the same degree of heat <a id="l735"></a>as before &amp; keep it longer in the water then before stirring it now &amp; <a id="l736"></a>then with a wooden stick to make the gold mix with fresh water: <a id="l737"></a>the gold would become finer then  by the Assay, &amp; by consequence <a id="l738"></a>finer then four &amp; twenty carats.

But the Refiners of this city know <a id="l742"></a>not how to refine gold by Antimony. And so silver also by being tested with <a id="l743"></a>more lead &amp; roasted becomes finer then by the common way of assaying, but <a id="l744"></a>not a half-penny weight finer.</p>

    <p id="par132">If Refiners should work perfectly in the same manner with Assayers <a id="l745"></a>that is, if they should mix gold with silver in the same proportion &amp; drive <a id="l746"></a>it off the test with the same proportion of lead &amp; hammer it to the same <a id="l747"></a>thinness &amp; water it with waters of the same strength in the same degree <a id="l748"></a>of heat during the same length of time, their gold would become just <a id="l749"></a>24 carats fine. And by imitating the Assayer their silver would become <a id="l750"></a>twelve ounces fine. But they work not with so much curiosity &amp; exact<a id="l751"></a>ness. Their fine gold &amp; fine silver must be assayed to know the just degree of <a id="l752"></a>fineness.</p>
    
    
            
    <p id="par134">Assays are liable to errors, but the errors are generally very small <a id="l757"></a>&amp; seldome exceed a quarter of a grain in gold &amp; an halfpenny weight in  <a id="l758"></a>silver.

    <p id="par142"><span class="large">A</span>ssaying &amp; refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer <a id="l805"></a>refines a small piece of any mass of gold or silver &amp; by the decrease <a id="l806"></a>of its weight makes his report, &amp; if there be no decrease, that is, if the <a id="l807"></a>mass  be of the same fineness with the refined Assay piece, he reports it  <a id="l808"></a>two carats better than standard, or twenty &amp; four carats fine; &amp; this <a id="l809"></a>is fine gold in the sense of the Law. The Assay-piece therefore when the <a id="l810"></a>Assayer works exactly becomes fine gold or fine silver in the sense <a id="l811"></a>of the law. And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule <a id="l812"></a>then the Refiner, &amp; makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the <a id="l813"></a>standing universal Rule of  valuing gold &amp; silver in all nations in point <a id="l814"></a>of fineness, &amp; the Law in ordeining that standard Gold shall be <a id="l815"></a>22 Carats fine &amp; standard silver 11 ounces two  penny weight fine, means <a id="l816"></a>by the Assay.</p>
    
    <p id="par143">The standard Triall pieces are made by the Assay. First the <a id="l817"></a>Iury procures gold &amp;  silver refined  by the Refiner, &amp; then assays the <a id="l818"></a>same several times to see if they be of a just degree of fineness; that  is, the gold just <a id="l819"></a>two carats better then standard &amp; the silver just 18 penny weight better. <a id="l820"></a>And then the Trial-pieces are made the Iury assays them several <a id="l821"></a>times to see if they be standard. They must agree therefore with the Assay as exactly <a id="l822"></a>as is possible least there be two standards.</p>
    
    <p id="par144">The assays of gold ought to be made with two waters &amp; no <a id="l823"></a>more, this being the constant practise of Assaying, &amp; the water ought <a id="l824"></a>to be of the usual strength, &amp; to work the usual time, &amp; in the usual <a id="l825"></a>heat, &amp; the Assay piece ought to be  hammered to <a id="l826"></a>the usual thinness that the assays may be uniform.</p>
    
    <p id="par145">Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 carats. <a id="l827"></a>They seldome make it above 23 Carats three three quarters <a id="l828"></a>of a grain fine, &amp; by fine gold generally understand  gold of this degree <a id="l829"></a>of fineness. And thence it comes  to pass that the goldsmiths are <a id="l830"></a>generally of opinion that gold cannot be made above 24 carats <a id="l831"></a>fine. But if when they have watered their granulated gold once or <a id="l832"></a>twice with Aqua fortis, they should dulcify it &amp; grind it very fine  <a id="l833"></a>as painters do thir colours, &amp; then dry it &amp; water it once or twice more with <a id="l834"></a>double Aqua fortis in the same degree of heat as  before, &amp; keep it <a id="l835"></a>longer in the water then before, stirring it now &amp; then with a wooden stick <a id="l836"></a>to make the gold mix with fresh water, the gold will become finer then four &amp; twenty carats. Chymists <a id="l837"></a>also tell us that Gold may be made finer by Antimony then by Aqua fortis and consequence then by the Assay.</p>
        
    <p id="par146">If Refiners should work perfectly in the same manner with Assayers, <a id="l838"></a>that is, if they should mix gold with silver in the same proportion, &amp; drive it <a id="l839"></a>off the Test with the same proportion of lead &amp; hammer it to the very same <a id="l840"></a>thinness &amp; water it with waters of the same strength in the same degree <a id="l841"></a>of heat during the same length of time; their gold would become just <a id="l842"></a>24 carats fine. But they work not with so much curiosity &amp;  <a id="l843"></a>eavenness.  In the fineness of gold made fine by the Refiners art there is much more <a id="l844"></a>uncertainty then in that of gold made fine by the Asaay.</p>

    <p id="par152">Assaying &amp; refining are operations of the same kind. <a id="l876"></a>The Assayer  refines a small piece of any mass of gold or <a id="l877"></a>silver &amp; by the decrease  of its weight makes his report: &amp; if <a id="l878"></a>there be no decrease, that is, if the mass  be of the same fineness <a id="l879"></a>with the refined Assay piece, he reports it two carrats better <a id="l880"></a>then standard, or twenty &amp; four carats fine: &amp; this is fine <a id="l881"></a>gold in the sense of the Law. The Assay-piece therefore when <a id="l882"></a>the Assayer works exactly, becomes fine gold or fine silver in <a id="l883"></a>the sense of the Law. And all gold &amp; silver of the same <a id="l884"></a>degree of fineness is fine gold &amp; fine silver among merchants <a id="l885"></a>in the sense of the Law. And because the Assayer works <a id="l886"></a>more exactly to a rule then the Refiner, &amp; makes better <a id="l887"></a>dispatch, the Assay is made the standing universal Rule of <a id="l888"></a>valuing gold &amp; silver in all nations in  point of fineness, <a id="l889"></a>&amp; the Law in ordeining that standard Gold shall be 22 carats <a id="l890"></a>fine &amp; standard silver 11 ounces 2 penny weight fine, means <a id="l891"></a>by the Assay.</p>
    
    <p id="par153">The assays of gold ought to be made with two waters &amp; no <a id="l892"></a> more, this being  the constant practise of assaying; &amp; the waters <a id="l893"></a>ought to be of the usual strength, (the second water stronger then the first,) <a id="l894"></a>&amp; to work the usual time &amp; in the  usual heat, &amp; the Assay piece <a id="l895"></a>ought to be hammered to the usual thinness  that the Assays may <a id="l896"></a>be uniform. And the assays of silver ought to be made  with a <a id="l897"></a>due proportion of lead in a due &amp; eaven heat, &amp; as soon as the <a id="l898"></a>lead is blown off &amp; the silver looks bright &amp; glittering, the silver <a id="l899"></a>must begin to cool  without roasting it, &amp; it must cool slowly that <a id="l900"></a>it do not spring. But in refining  gold &amp; silver in great quantities <a id="l901"></a>these niceties are not observed</p>
    
    <p id="par154">Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 <a id="l902"></a>carats. They  seldome make it above 23 carats 3 grains &amp; 3 quarters <a id="l903"></a>of a grain fine, &amp; by fine gold generally understand  gold of this <a id="l904"></a>degree of fineness. And if gold at any time prove finer upon the <a id="l905"></a>Assay, Assayermasters out of prejudice do not report it finer. And <a id="l906"></a>thence it comes  to pass that the Goldsmiths are generally of <a id="l907"></a>opinion that gold cannot be above 24  carats fine. But <a id="l908"></a>if when they have watered their granulated gold once or twice <a id="l909"></a>with Aqua fortis, they should dulcify it &amp; grind it very fine <a id="l910"></a>as painters do their colours, &amp; then water it once or twice more <a id="l911"></a>with double Aqua fortis in the same degree of heat as before <a id="l912"></a>&amp; keep it longer in the water then before stirring it now &amp; <a id="l913"></a>then with a wooden stick to make the gold mix with fresh water <a id="l914"></a>the Gold will become finer then by the Assay, &amp; by consequence

        finer then four &amp; twenty carats. Chymists also tell us that Gold <a id="l915"></a>may be made finer by Antimony then by Aqua fortis, &amp; by conse<a id="l916"></a>quence then by the Assay; &amp; Gold refined by Antimony is of a <a id="l917"></a>better colour then Gold refined by Aqua fortis, &amp; by reason of <a id="l918"></a>its fineness will god much further in gilding as I have heard. But the Refiners of <a id="l919"></a>this city know not how to refine gold by Antimony.   <a id="l922"></a>silver by more lead &amp; being roasted, becomes finer then by the common way <a id="l923"></a>of assaying, but not a halfpenny weight finer.</p>
