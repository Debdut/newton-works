    <p id="par1">1 In  December 1714 Sir Iohn Erskin in a Mountain neare his house at Alva in Scotland beyon the <a id="l1"></a>frith,  met with a vein of Lead Ore holding some silver, &amp; <a id="l2"></a>in Iuly &amp; August 1715 the vein began to appear more promising, &amp; in September <a id="l3"></a>Sir Iohn left his house &amp; went into the Rebellion, &amp; his LAdy pursuing the vein <a id="l4"></a>they melted down part of the Ore &amp; buried the rest in Casks near Sir Iohn's house <a id="l5"></a>And in February following they left off working &amp; filled up the Mine with <a id="l6"></a>earth. And Iames Hamilton, who had been imployed in smelting the Ore brought <a id="l7"></a>some of it to London  in March or April (1716) &amp; made the Lord Maior acquainted <a id="l8"></a>with the richness of the Mine, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Haldane the brother in law of Sir Iohn <a id="l9"></a>made the matter known at court.</p>
    
    <p id="par2">2 It was at first proposed to send down Sir Isaac Newton to examin <a id="l10"></a>the Mine, but he represented himself unacquainted with such matters, &amp; declined <a id="l11"></a>recommending any body else in point of skill, saying that it would be better to <a id="l12"></a>send down somebody of skill from the kings silver Mines in Germany. Whereupon <a id="l13"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Iustus Brandshagen was proposed by others.</p>
    
    <p id="par3">3 And his Royal Highness the Prince (then Regent) signed a Warrant Aug. 20 1716 <a id="l14"></a>to the Commissioners of the Treasury directing them to pay or cause to be paid to <a id="l15"></a>Iustus Brandshagen 60<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> &amp; to Iames Hamilton 30<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> to enable them to go <a id="l16"></a>down to Scotland to work or try the working of this Mine, &amp; further to pay <a id="l17"></a>or cause to be payd to I. Brandshagen 20<sup>s</sup> per diem &amp; to Iam. Hamilton 10 <sup>s</sup> <a id="l18"></a>per diem from the day or says they should respectively arrive at Edin<a id="l19"></a>burgh for &amp; during their stay in Scotland upon the said work, or so <a id="l20"></a>long as the said Commissioners should see cause to pay the said respective <a id="l21"></a>allowances to them or either of them in consideration of their or either <a id="l22"></a>of their service &amp; application to the said work, &amp; the testimony they <a id="l23"></a>should receive thereof. And Brandshagen &amp; Hamilton by an Order from the Treasury dated Aug 27 received their advance <a id="l24"></a>money at the Exchequer Aug. 31.</p>
    
    <p id="par4">4 The Prince also signed (3<sup>d</sup> Sept. 1716) a Paper of Instructions to <a id="l25"></a>be observed by them in the survey &amp; tryal of the Mine in the pre<a id="l26"></a>sence &amp; with the assistance of M<sup>r</sup> Haldane aforesaid, M<sup>r</sup> Drummond Warden of his Majestys Mint <a id="l27"></a>at Edinburgh &amp; any other persons whom the  Earl of Lau<a id="l28"></a>derdale General of the said Mint should send thither, &amp; to make <a id="l29"></a>a return  in writing of all their proceedings therin <a id="l30"></a>to the Commissioners of his Majestys Treasury with the utmost expe<a id="l31"></a>dition. In this Paper Iames Hamilton is stiled Assistent to Iustus <a id="l32"></a>Brandshagen, &amp; the buisiness of watching the Mine is not among <a id="l33"></a>the Instructions.</p>
    
    <p id="par5">5 After this, Iames Hamilton knowing his own insufficiency, was <a id="l34"></a>averse from going without his brother Tho. Hamilton, &amp; thereby put the <a id="l35"></a>government to the expence of 109<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> to send his brother Thomas down <a id="l36"></a>with him. And without Thomas they could not have gone through the <a id="l37"></a>business. See M<sup>r</sup> Drummonds Letter to Sir I. N. dated Feb. 17 1717. Thomas <a id="l38"></a>therefore was promised the same allowance with his brother. And Sir Is. <a id="l39"></a>Newton by Order advanced  to him the 30<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> &amp; by Warrant of the Commissioners of <a id="l40"></a>the Treasury dated Sept. 5. 1716 was repaid at the Exchequer.</p>
    
    <p id="par6">6 The Hamiltons arrived at Edinburgh Sept. 14 &amp; Brandshagen Octob. <a id="l41"></a>13<sup>th</sup>. And tho Iames Hamilton had pretended to know the Mine, yet they <a id="l42"></a>loitered still at Edinburgh some weeks till Sir Iohn Erskin came down to shew <a id="l43"></a>them the Mine. By the Princes directions they were to make hast, &amp; yet <a id="l44"></a>they were above five months in Scotland in executing their Commission <a id="l45"></a>tho they might have done it in less then half the time. They loitered so much <a id="l46"></a>that the Earl of Lauderdale M<sup>r</sup> Haldane &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Drummond declared them<a id="l47"></a>selves ashamed of the delays, as appears by M<sup>r</sup> Drummonds aforesaid Letter to Sir I. <a id="l48"></a>N. dated Feb. 16  1717. And all this negligence the Commissioners of the Treasury <a id="l49"></a>were impowered by the Prince's Warrant to consider.</p>
    
    <p id="par7">7 When they had finished the work of surveying the Mine, &amp; were preparing to draw <a id="l50"></a>up the Report,  Sir Is. Newton received two Letters dated Ian. 8<sup>th</sup> &amp; <a id="l52"></a>Ian. 24 &amp; signed by the Earl of Lauderdale, M<sup>r</sup> Haldane &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Drummond <a id="l53"></a> in the first of which they described <a id="l54"></a>the form, bigness &amp; richness of the vein of Ore, &amp;  moved that he should
    
    <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p246v"> &lt;246v&gt; </span>
        
        acquaint the Lords of the Treasury that this survey was over &amp; that <a id="l55"></a>the Report was preparing: &amp; in the second that every thing was then in <a id="l56"></a>readiness &amp; that they intended to have sent up the Report  with the Assays &amp; Ore <a id="l57"></a> by Express that night (Ian 24,) but were stopt by  a sudden resolution of Branshagen &amp; the two Hamiltons <a id="l59"></a>(directly contrary to the Princes Order) that the Reports should not come up before them but they would bring it up <a id="l60"></a>themselves. And after this they loitered at Edinburgh till Feb. 19 &amp; so <a id="l61"></a>put the government to the superfluous charge of 40<sup>s</sup> per diem for the <a id="l62"></a>space of 26 days more, which is as much money as Hamilton now sues for <a id="l63"></a>wanting only 10<sup>s</sup>.</p>
    
    <p id="par8">8 In the said second Letter a Question was insinuated whether Brandshagen <a id="l64"></a>&amp; the two Hamiltons should all of them leave Edinburgh without order, &amp; <a id="l65"></a>Sir I. Newton Ian 31 by Order wrote back that Tho. Hamilton should stay to <a id="l66"></a> watch the mine &amp; see that no Ore be carried away till the Kings pleasure should <a id="l67"></a>be known. But the said three Commissioners at Edinburgh, having found Thomas much <a id="l68"></a>more skilful  in the business they were sent upon then his brother <a id="l69"></a>Iames, sent Thomas to London to give an Account of the Report &amp; of the <a id="l70"></a>whole affair, &amp; deteined Iames to watch the Mine. See M<sup>r</sup> Drummonds <a id="l71"></a>above-mentioned Letter of Feb. 16, 1717. It was not therefore by Sir Isaacs <a id="l72"></a>order that Iames Hamilton staid in Scotland to watch the Mine. And there is <a id="l73"></a>no reason that Sir Isaac should pay the wages of a man whom he did not <a id="l74"></a>imploy.</p>
    
    <p id="par9">After Brandshagen came to London he loitered till April 29 before he <a id="l75"></a>gave in the Report &amp; till May 17<sup>th</sup> before he petitioned for the money due for their services. And there is no reason that  Sir I. N. should <a id="l76"></a>pay 10<sup>s</sup>  per diem to Iames Hamilton during the   twelve weeks  which <a id="l77"></a>were spent by Brandshagens loitering</p>
    
    <p id="par10">Iames Hamilton demands 10<sup>s</sup> per diem for watching the Mine. 145 <a id="l78"></a>days. It is not certain that he watched it so long before he had notice <a id="l79"></a>to come away. The whole business after Feb. 19 might have been dis<a id="l80"></a>patched in a third part of that time. And Sir Isaac Newton was not the <a id="l81"></a>occasion of any delays.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="par12">The Earl of Lauderdale, M<sup>r</sup> Haldane, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Drummond, who were <a id="l83"></a>joyned in Commission with Brandshagen &amp; Hamilton to survey the Mine <a id="l84"></a>&amp; see the Ore cut of from it &amp; assayed, accounted their Commission by <a id="l85"></a>the Princes Warrant at an end when they finished their Report &amp; <a id="l86"></a>sent it away to London, as appears by their Letters above mentioned <a id="l87"></a>to Sir Is. Newton dated Ian 8 &amp; Ian 24, 1717. Brandshagen delivered the <a id="l88"></a>Report &amp; Assays &amp; Ores to the Commissioners for the moneys due to him &amp; the two <a id="l89"></a>Hamiltons for that service representing that it ended Apr. 29. On Iune 17 the said Commissioners referred the <a id="l90"></a> Petition to Sir Isaac Newton directing him to state the <a id="l91"></a>case of Brandshagen &amp; the two Hamiltons, &amp; report his opinion what <a id="l92"></a>was fit to be done thereupon for discharging the Princes Warrant &amp; putting <a id="l93"></a>an end to all further demands of any of them on this account. On Iune 27 <a id="l94"></a>Sir Isaac gave in his Report of what was due to all three till Feb. 19<sup>th</sup>, the <a id="l95"></a>day on which their Commission ended, &amp; left it to the Commissioners of the Treasury <a id="l96"></a>to allow to Iames Hamilton what they should think fit for watching the Mine <a id="l97"></a>after Feb. 19. And on Iuly 24 the Commissioners of the Treasury issued their War<a id="l98"></a>rant to the Earl of Halifax to pay to D<sup>r</sup> I. Fr. Fauquier, the arrieres due to <a id="l99"></a> the said Brandshagen &amp; the two Hamiltons according <a id="l100"></a>to the said Report, &amp; further added a round summ of 20<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> for  <a id="l101"></a>Iames Hamilton for watching the Mine after Feb. 19. And The D<sup>r</sup> received &amp; <a id="l102"></a>paid them their arrieres.</p>
        
        <p id="par13">Sir I. Newton neither received nor paid any moneys for or to Iames Hamilton or on account of the <a id="l103"></a>Princes Warrant nor had any benefit by that business. He acted all along by <a id="l104"></a>order &amp; had nothing to do in that matter after Iune 27 the day on which he gave <a id="l105"></a>in his final Report. The Commissioners in Scotland. Sir Is. Newton, &amp; the Commissioners of the Treasury all <a id="l106"></a>agreed that the Execution of the Princes Warrant was finished Feb. 19. Brandshagen peti<a id="l107"></a>tioned for the allowance of 20<sup>s</sup> per diem to himself &amp; 10<sup>s</sup> per diem to the two Hamiltons <a id="l108"></a>till Apr. 29 the day on which he delivered the Report to the Commissioners of the Treasury but was <a id="l109"></a>over-ruled by the said Commissioners &amp; submitted. For they were appointed Iudges of this <a id="l110"></a>matter by the Princes Warrant.</p>
