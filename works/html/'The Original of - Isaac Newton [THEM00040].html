<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Chap. 1 <a id="l1"></a><br>The original of Monarchies.<br><br></h2>
<p id="par1">The whole earth was by the first inhabitants divided <a id="l2"></a>into many coordinate governments according to the number <a id="l3"></a>of families. For when Moses had recconed up the posterity <a id="l4"></a>of Noah to the fourth generation, he adds. <em class="underline">These are the <a id="l5"></a>families of the sons of Noah after their generations in <a id="l6"></a>their nations &amp; by these were the nations divided after <a id="l7"></a>the flood</em>. Which is as much as to say, that as Noah <a id="l8"></a>divided the whole earth between his three sons &amp; gave <a id="l9"></a>Europe to Iaphet; Asia to Sem &amp; Africa to Ham <a id="l10"></a>without making any one Lord of the others territories: <a id="l11"></a>so each of these divided his part between his sons &amp; <a id="l12"></a>each of them their parts between theirs without making <a id="l13"></a>any one Lord of anothers inheritance till the whole <a id="l14"></a>earth was distributed into independant &amp; coordinate nati<a id="l15"></a>ons tribes &amp; families. For what Moses saith of the di<a id="l16"></a>vision of the whole earth among all the posterity of <a id="l17"></a>Noah, he saith of the division of the several parts <a id="l18"></a>among the posterity of his severall sons. For when he <a id="l19"></a>had recconed up the children &amp; grand-children of Iaphet <a id="l20"></a>he subjoyns. <em class="underline">By these were the Isles of the Gentiles <a id="l21"></a>divided in their lands every one after his tongue after <a id="l22"></a>their families in their nations</em>. And so of the rest. So <a id="l23"></a>then upon the first plantation of the earth there were <a id="l24"></a>no standing kingdoms. Every father was soveraign Lord <a id="l25"></a>of his own inheritance during his life &amp; then his sons <a id="l26"></a>became soveraign Lords of their several shares &amp; so <a id="l27"></a>on till the earth was planted with innumerable <a id="l28"></a>scattered families not subject to any other Lords then <a id="l29"></a>their own common fathers. For I here reccon every <a id="l30"></a>father with all his posterity to be one family &amp; upon <a id="l31"></a>the fathers death to break into so many families <a id="l32"></a>as he left sons surviving him.</p>
<p id="par2">Yet wars arising between them in some places sooner <a id="l33"></a>in others later about their possessions put things into <a id="l34"></a>some disorder. ffor it was the necessary consequence of such <a id="l35"></a>wars that those of a tribe or neighbourhood should consult <a id="l36"></a>together for their common safety &amp; chuse out wise &amp; valiant <a id="l37"></a>men to lead them against their enemies &amp; fortify <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> places with walls within which should be many houses for <a id="l38"></a>the people to resort unto out of the fields &amp; villages in time <a id="l39"></a>of danger. And this was the original of cities &amp; kingdoms. <a id="l40"></a>For these fortified places became the first cities &amp; the fathers <a id="l41"></a>of families became the elders of the city composing a Council <a id="l42"></a>with the same legislative &amp; judicial power over the whole body <a id="l43"></a>of all their families which every father had before <a id="l44"></a>over his own apart, &amp; the captain of their forces being <a id="l45"></a>the most honourable &amp; potent amongst the Elders became their King. <a id="l46"></a>For every city was in the first ages walled about with <a id="l47"></a>high walls &amp; gates &amp; barrs for its defence (Deut. 3.5 <a id="l48"></a>Levit. 25.30,31) &amp; had its  <a id="l49"></a>court of Elders (Deut. 22.15. Iudg. 8.14. Ruth 4.2.)  &amp; <a id="l50"></a>its country or territory of villages (Levit 25.31 Iosh. 21.12) <a id="l51"></a>which were therefore called the villages of the city (Iosh. <a id="l52"></a>16 &amp; 18 &amp; 19.) And such Cities as these with their <a id="l53"></a> villages were the kingdoms of the first Kings, as is plain <a id="l54"></a>both because those kings are in sacred  history called <a id="l55"></a>Kings not of whole nations or countries (as they were <a id="l56"></a>afterwards when grown great) but of cities only &amp; because <a id="l57"></a>the cities were so very small &amp; numerous. For Abraham&amp; his confederates with <a id="l58"></a>an army of 318 men beat four kings with their army <a id="l59"></a>when they had newly beaten five others; &amp; those five <a id="l60"></a>were kings of so many single cities Sodom, Gomorrah, <a id="l61"></a>Admah, Zeboim &amp; Zoar. ffor the four first perished <a id="l62"></a>together in the Lake of Sodom &amp; therefore bordered upon <a id="l63"></a>one another without any other cities between them &amp; <a id="l64"></a>Zoar was the nearest city which Lot could fly unto <a id="l65"></a>from Sodom &amp; is called a little one &amp; yet had its <a id="l66"></a>proper king.</p>
<p id="par3">Its true that Nimrod built &amp; reigned over divers cities <a id="l67"></a>but it may be presumed that he built them for his chil<a id="l68"></a>dren &amp; left to every one his inheritance. ffor Bochartus <a id="l69"></a>hath shewn that the son's of Chus were planted in several <a id="l70"></a>regions round about the Persian gulf from the furthest part <a id="l71"></a>of Arabia felix to the furthest part of Carmania, &amp; <a id="l72"></a>therefore Chus with his family leaving the parts of <a id="l73"></a>Egypt where they first dwelt with their father Cham <a id="l74"></a>went into the region of Chaldea &amp; Susiana (thence called the land of Chus)  &amp; <a id="l75"></a>subduing the inhabitants seated themselves there &amp; on the Persian gulf, the father <a id="l76"></a>dividing his new territories among all his sons according to <a id="l77"></a>the law of those times &amp; the lot of Nimrod falling in <a id="l78"></a>Chaldæa. For there was the beginning of  Nimrods kingdom before <a id="l79"></a>he went into Assyria. And as Chus thus divided his territories <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> amongst all his sons so it is to be presumed that his <a id="l80"></a>sons &amp; grandsons (Nimrod as well as the rest) divided <a id="l81"></a>theirs among their children according to the same law <a id="l82"></a>till kingdoms became as small in those regions as in <a id="l83"></a>other parts of the world. ffor I shal shew  presently <a id="l84"></a>that the famous Assyrian Monarchy grew up by <a id="l85"></a>conquest out of many small kingdoms long after those <a id="l86"></a>first ages. Another instance of this kind we have in the 12 sons of Ishmael who dwelt from Havila to Shur on the way from Egypt to Assyria. For when Moses had named them he subjoyns. <em class="underline">These are the sons of Ismael &amp; these are their names by their towns &amp; by their castles, twelve Princes according to their nations</em>. Gen. 25 16.</p>
    <p id="par4">
    So then the first kingdoms were single cities &amp; <a id="l87"></a>those perhaps not so big nor so well peopled as our <a id="l88"></a>Villages. And this seems to have been the state of things <a id="l89"></a>till after the days of Abraham. But at length many of <a id="l90"></a>these cities either by conquest or by consent for strengthning <a id="l91"></a>themselves grew into one kingdom &amp; such kingdoms were in all <a id="l92"></a>places very small &amp; numerous till after the age of Moses <a id="l93"></a>but yet by conquering one another grew bigger &amp; bigger till <a id="l94"></a>the rise of the four Monarchies. ffor Moses thought 12000 <a id="l95"></a>men sufficient to fight the  Midianites or Ismaelites &amp; yet <a id="l96"></a>that nation was y<sup>n</sup> divided into five kingdoms. In a small part of <a id="l97"></a>that small country of Canaan Moses conquered  Og the king of <a id="l98"></a> Bashan who had sixty cities in his Kingdom &amp;  Sihon <a id="l99"></a>King of the Ammorites whose kingdom was much greater. <a id="l100"></a>ffor all the kingdom of Og was given only to half the tribe <a id="l101"></a>of Manasseh &amp; the kingdom of Sihon sufficed for the two <a id="l102"></a>tribes of Reuben &amp; Gad (Deut 2.12, 13. Iosh. 12.2.) In the rest of <a id="l103"></a>Canaan there were 31  Kingdoms conquered by Ioshua besides <a id="l104"></a>others left unconquered &amp; these  were grown up out of a <a id="l105"></a>far greater number of the first kingdoms. ffor Adonibezeck <a id="l106"></a> king of one of these kingdoms  had conquered <a id="l107"></a>twenty other kings &amp; cut off their thumbs &amp; great toes. In <a id="l108"></a>the lot of Iudah &amp; Reuben there were at least 126 cities <a id="l109"></a>besides the daughters (as they are called) of Ekron Ashdod &amp; Gaza (Iosh 15 &amp; 19) <a id="l110"></a>By the daughters are meant the cities subject to the three Metropolises <a id="l111"></a>or mother-citys of these kingdoms which if we may reccon to be  about 20 in <a id="l112"></a>a kingdom that is 60 in all the whole number will be 186 cities. In the <a id="l113"></a>Tribe of Levi alone there were 48 cities whereof nine were <a id="l114"></a>given out of the two tribes of Iudah &amp; Reuben  <a id="l115"></a>&amp; ten out of the two Tribes &amp; an half beyond Iordan (Ios. 21) <a id="l116"></a>&amp; the rest out of the other Tribes in proportion to the <a id="l117"></a>number of cities in each (Num. 35.8) Whence its easy <a id="l118"></a>to compute that there were about a thousand walled cities <a id="l119"></a>in all Canaan besides those which had been rased by wars, <a id="l120"></a>&amp; by consequence about so many kingdoms in the beginning <a id="l121"></a>before some of them conquered the rest.</p>
<p id="par5">The like number of little kingdoms seems in the first <a id="l122"></a>ages to have been spread over all Syria. For tho these king<a id="l123"></a>doms grew daily more great &amp; less numerous, yet Syria con<a id="l124"></a>tinued divided into little kingdoms till the Assyrians invaded <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> it. For in the reign of king David Hadadezer king of Soba <a id="l125"></a>(a town between Iudæa &amp; Euphrates) was confederate with <a id="l126"></a>Damascus &amp; three other kings of Syria who served him &amp; had wars <a id="l127"></a>with Toy king of Hamath or Epiphania another city of <a id="l128"></a>Syria. And a little after Benhadad king of Damascus <a id="l129"></a>in his war with Ahab was assisted by 32 other kings <a id="l130"></a>which served him as tributary Princes: ffor upon losing the <a id="l131"></a>battel he displaced them &amp; put captains in their room <a id="l132"></a>over their forces (1 King. 20.1, 24.) And yet Benhadad was <a id="l133"></a>not king of all Syria. ffor beyond him was the Kingdom <a id="l134"></a>of Hamath still  standing &amp; that also of Arpad or the <a id="l135"></a>Aradij both potent kingdoms &amp; these kingdoms continued <a id="l136"></a>till the Assyrians conquered them.</p>
<p id="par6">For the whole Assyrian Monarchy seems to have risen <a id="l137"></a>out of such little kingdoms as these not long before the cap<a id="l138"></a>tivity of the ten tribes.  The Prophet Amos<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>   about sixty or seventy years before that captivity, thus threatens them with what had lately <a id="l140"></a>befallen other kingdoms: <em class="underline">Pass ye</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">to Cälneh &amp; see, &amp; from <a id="l141"></a>thence go  to Hamath the great, then go down to Gath <a id="l142"></a>of the Philistines.

<p id="par7">In these conquests are involved on the west &amp; south side <a id="l175"></a>of Assyria the kingdoms of Mesopotamia whose royal seats <a id="l176"></a>were Haran or Carrhæ, &amp; Carchemish or Circusium, &amp; Sepharvaim <a id="l177"></a>a city upon Euphrates between Babylon &amp; Nineve called Sipparæ by Berosus <a id="l178"></a>Abydenus &amp; Polyhistor &amp; Sipphara by Ptolomy, &amp; the Kingdoms of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> Syria seated at Samaria, Damascus, Gath, Hamath, Arpad,  &amp; Rezeph a  City placed by Ptolomy near Thapsacus.

On the east were Elymais &amp; <a id="l187"></a>the Cities of the Medes &amp; Kir a City &amp; large region between Elymais &amp; Assyria (Isa. 22.6) called Kirene by the Chalde Paraphrast <a id="l188"></a>&amp; Latin interpreter &amp; Carine by Ptolomy.

Thus did <a id="l196"></a>these new conquests extend every way from the very  border <a id="l197"></a>of Assyria &amp; make up the great body of that Monarchy: so <a id="l198"></a>that well might the king of Assyria boast how his armies <a id="l199"></a>had  destroyed all lands <a id="l201"></a> All these nations ✝ <sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup>  had till now their several Gods &amp; <a id="l205"></a>each accounted his God the God of his own land &amp; the defender <a id="l206"></a>thereof against the Gods of the neighbouring countries, and particularly against that of Assyria &amp; there<a id="l207"></a>fore they were never till now  united under the Assyrian Monarchy: but now being small kingdoms the King of Assyria <a id="l209"></a>easily overflowed them. <em class="underline">Know ye not</em>, saith Sennacherib to <a id="l210"></a>the Iews, <sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup>  <em class="underline">what I &amp; my fathers have done unto all the <a id="l211"></a>people of other lands? – for No God of any nation or kingdom <a id="l212"></a>was able to deliver his people out of  mine hand &amp; out <a id="l213"></a>of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God de<a id="l214"></a>liver you out of mine hand</em>?

<p id="par9">Tis true that this City ✝<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup>  including the large gardens &amp;  suburbs <a id="l267"></a>for  feeding of Cattel, was a great city in the days of <a id="l268"></a>Ionah that is about eighty or  an hundred years before the captivity <a id="l269"></a>of the ten tribes. Nahum<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup>  who lived after the reign of <a id="l270"></a>Sennacherib represents that it had been long a populous city, <a id="l271"></a>and Herodotus  that it reigned over the upper or greater <a id="l272"></a>Asia 500 years. And so long perhaps it might have been one <a id="l273"></a>of the greatest cities in the east, but yet it grew not up <a id="l274"></a>before the reign of Pul to that extent of Dominion which <a id="l275"></a> was  called the kingdom of Assyria &amp; accounted one of the great monarchies. ffor before <a id="l276"></a>his reign there is not one word of this  Monarchy in all  the scriptures, thô after he began to make it <a id="l278"></a>great, it's mentioned both in  sacred history &amp; in <a id="l279"></a>the Prophets in the reign of almost every king. In the days <a id="l280"></a>of Ionas it was not so great &amp; potent as not to be terrified at the preach<a id="l281"></a>ing of Ionas &amp; fear being invaded by its neighbours and ruined within forty <a id="l282"></a>days.   After it grew potent its kings were constantly called <a id="l283"></a>kings of Assyria but till the days of Ionas they were called <a id="l284"></a>only ✝<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup>  kings of Nineveh  &amp;  at his preaching the decree of the <a id="l285"></a>King &amp; his nobles for a  solemn fast was  published only through <a id="l286"></a>Nineveh.  ffor by that name it seems the kingdom as well <a id="l287"></a>as the city was hitherto called. When Ieroboam the son <a id="l288"></a>of Ioash king of Israel had newly subdued the kingdoms of Damas<a id="l289"></a>cus &amp; Hamath, the Prophet Amos thus reproves Israel for <a id="l290"></a>being lifted up. <sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup>  <em class="underline">Ye which rejoyce in a thing of nought, which <a id="l291"></a>say, Have we not taken to us horns by our strength?

In the prophesies of Isaiah <a id="l298"></a>Ieremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Micah, Nahum, Zephany &amp; <a id="l299"></a>Zechary which were written after this monarchy grew <a id="l300"></a>up, its openly named upon all occasions, but in this of Amos <a id="l301"></a>not once, thô the captivity of Syria &amp; Israel thereby be the sub<a id="l302"></a>ject of the prophesy &amp; that of Israel be often threatned. <a id="l303"></a>He only saith in general that Israel notwithstanding <a id="l304"></a>her present greatness should be captivated &amp; that he would <a id="l305"></a>raise up a nation to do it, meaning that he would raise  <a id="l306"></a>up above them from a lower condition a nation whom they yet feared not.. ffor so the hebrew <a id="l307"></a>word מקם signifies when applied to men, as in Amos 5.2 <a id="l308"></a>1 Sam. 2.8. 2 Sam. 12.11.  Psal. 113.7. Ier. 10.20. <a id="l309"></a>&amp; 50.32. Hab 1.6. Zech 11.16. The Assyrian Monarchy therefore <a id="l310"></a>rose up after the writing of this Prophesy &amp; by consequence <a id="l311"></a>in the reign of Pul &amp; his successors. For after Ierobo<a id="l312"></a>am had conquered Damascus &amp; Hamath his successor Mena<a id="l313"></a>hem destroyed Tipsah with its territories upon Euphrates because in his expedition against Shallum who usurped the crown they opened not to him &amp; ther <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006v"> &lt;6v&gt; </span>fore Israel continued in its greatness till Pul<sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup>  (probably grown <a id="l314"></a>formidable by some victories) caused Menahem  to buy his peace. <a id="l315"></a> Pul therefore reigning presently after the prophesy <a id="l316"></a>of Amos &amp; being the first upon record who began to fulfil it, may <a id="l317"></a>justly (in the sense of the scriptures) be accounted the founder <a id="l318"></a>of this Monarchy.</p>
<p id="par10">Had we distinct accounts<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 6r resumes &gt; </span> Had we distinct accounts of those early ages I doubt <a id="l319"></a>not but we might find a much greater number of kingdoms <a id="l320"></a>which went to make up the body of this  monarchy <a id="l321"></a>then we have  recconed up.

Thereupon they created one Dejoces their King &amp; <a id="l334"></a>at his request built  a palace fit for such a king <a id="l335"></a>&amp; a City whose walls equalled those of Athens in compass, <a id="l336"></a>there being it seems till then no city in all Media <a id="l337"></a>big enough &amp; well enough fortified &amp; adorned for a royall <a id="l338"></a>seat.

These were three <a id="l367"></a>kingdoms &amp; their kings, who were Menestheus, Agamemnon <a id="l368"></a>&amp; Agapenor, led their forces against Troy. The rest <a id="l369"></a>were either kingdoms or aggregates of free cities or <a id="l370"></a>small kingdoms not yet well united into one government. <a id="l371"></a>For Pausanias tells us<sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup>  that all Greece was at first go<a id="l372"></a>verned by kings before common wealths were instituted. <a id="l373"></a>By the original &amp; ancient constitution of the kingdoms of <a id="l374"></a>Athens, Mycenæ &amp; Arcadia you may understand that of <a id="l375"></a>the rest.</p>
<p id="par13"> That of Athens is thus set down by Thucydides.<sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup> <em class="underline">Vnder Cecrops</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">&amp; the ancient kings untill <a id="l376"></a> Theseus, Attica always</em> κατὰ πολεις ὠκειτο, πρυτανεια <a id="l377"></a>τι ἔχουσα καὶ ἄρχοντας <em class="underline">was inhabited city by city, having</em> <a id="l378"></a> <em class="underline">magistrates &amp; Prytanea</em> <a id="l379"></a>or Courts with the Vestal fire adjoyning. <em class="underline">Neither did they <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> consult the king when there was no fear of danger but <a id="l380"></a>each apart administred their own common-wealth &amp; had their <a id="l381"></a>own Council. Yea some, as the Eleusinians with Eumolpus <a id="l382"></a>against Erichtheus, did sometimes make war. But when <a id="l383"></a>Theseus a  prudent &amp; potent man obteined the <a id="l384"></a>kingdom he took away the Councils &amp; Magistrates  <a id="l385"></a>of other cities &amp; made them all meet in one Council <a id="l386"></a>&amp; Prytaneum at Athens.</em> To the same purpose Plutarch <a id="l387"></a>also relates<sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup>  how that the people of Attica were divided &amp; <a id="l388"></a>difficult to be called together to consult about their common <a id="l389"></a>affairs &amp; sometimes disagreed &amp; made wars upon one another <a id="l390"></a>till Theseus perswaded them to convene into one polity which <a id="l391"></a>should be free &amp; have the whole power lodged in the <a id="l392"></a>people excepting only that he would manage their wars <a id="l393"></a>&amp; put their laws in execution. To which when they <a id="l394"></a>agreed he dissolved the Prytanea &amp; Courts &amp; Magistracy <a id="l395"></a>which they had in their several cities &amp; erected in Athens <a id="l396"></a>one Prytaneum &amp; Court common to them all, which, saith <a id="l397"></a>Plutarch is still there to be seen. So then the govern<a id="l398"></a>ment of every city was at first complete &amp; absolute in matters <a id="l399"></a>both civil &amp; sacred. Every City had its Prytaneum or Vestal <a id="l400"></a>temple with a Court in it for the council of the City to sacrifice and consult <a id="l401"></a>about civil affairs. ffor the Magistrates in the first ages were <a id="l402"></a>also the Priests. And hence it is that  πολιτεία <em class="underline">polity</em>, which sig<a id="l403"></a>nifies the government of a city, has been ever since used for <a id="l404"></a>the government of a kingdom or any other free &amp; absolute <a id="l405"></a>government. Polemon tells us <sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup>  that in this body of Attica <a id="l406"></a>there were an hundred &amp; seventy δήμοι distinct peoples <a id="l407"></a>or cities, one of which was the city Eleusis so famous for her <a id="l408"></a>sacred mysteries. And these continued free till the reign of <a id="l409"></a>Cecrops their first common captain or king. For Philo<a id="l410"></a>chorus relates<sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup>  that <em class="underline">when Attica was infested by sea <a id="l411"></a>&amp; land by the Cares &amp; Bœoti, Cecrops first of any man <a id="l412"></a>reduced the multitude</em> (that is the 170 cities) <em class="underline">into twelve <a id="l413"></a>cities whose names were Cecropia, Tetrapolis, Epacria, <a id="l414"></a>Decelea, Eleusis, Aphydna, Thoricus, Brauron, Cytherus, <a id="l415"></a>Sphettus, Cephissia &amp; Phalerus, &amp; that Theseus afterwards <a id="l416"></a>contracted these twelve cities into one which was Athens</em>. <a id="l417"></a>By this you may perceive that Cecrops the first king of <a id="l418"></a>Attica was only a Captain of the forces of all the cities <a id="l419"></a>elected in time of danger.  According to the Arundelian Marble he  was made their captain <a id="l420"></a>or king about  63 years before Cadmus brought letters into Europe, &amp; Theseus <a id="l421"></a> was contemporary to the Argonauts, being the  predecessor of <a id="l422"></a>Menestheus who went to the war of Troy.</p>
<p id="par14"> The original of the kingdom of the Argives was much <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> after the same manner. ffor saith Pausanias, <sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup> Φορωνεὺς δὲ ὁ Ινάχου <a id="l423"></a>τοὺς ἀνθρώπους συνάγαγε πρωτον ἐις κοινὸν σποράδας τεώς <a id="l424"></a>καὶ ἰφ᾽ εαυτων ἑκάστοτε ὀικουντας καὶ τὸ κωρίον ἐς ὁ <a id="l425"></a>πρωτον ἠθροίσθησαν, αστυ ὠνομάσθη Φορώνικον: <em class="underline">Phoroneus <a id="l426"></a>the son of Inachus was the first who gathered into one <a id="l427"></a>community the Argives who till then were scattered &amp; <a id="l428"></a>lived every where apart: and the place where they</em> <a id="l429"></a> <em class="underline">were first assembled was called the city <a id="l430"></a>of Phoroneus</em>.

The <a id="l433"></a>altar was doubtless for the worship of the common assem<a id="l434"></a>bly &amp; the brutish life from which he reduced them was <a id="l435"></a>that of warring upon one another. He  was contemporary to Cadmus or but a very little ancienter. ffor when the Phenician merchants stole away his sister Io &amp; carried her into Egypt the Greeks in revenge stole away Europa from the Phenicians.</p>
<p id="par15"> The people of Arcadia were a branch of the Pe<a id="l437"></a>lasgi &amp; the Pelasgi are accounted one of the oldest <a id="l438"></a>nations of Greece.  They had their name from Pelasgus their first king, it being usual in those days to call the people &amp; country after the name of  the king. This was not the son of Niobe Hesiod  <a id="l441"></a>accounts him <sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup> ἀυτόχθονα a son of the earth a native of the country &amp; Pausanias tells <a id="l442"></a>us <sup class="note" id="n26-ref">[26]</sup>  that the Arcadians accounted him the first man &amp; that he was their first king  &amp; taught the ignorant people to build <a id="l443"></a>houses for defending themselves from heat &amp; cold &amp; rain <a id="l444"></a>&amp; to make them garments of skins &amp; instead of hearbs <a id="l445"></a>&amp; roots which were sometimes noxious, to eat the acorns <a id="l446"></a>of the beech tree: that all Peloponnesus was at first <a id="l447"></a>called from him Pelasgia, &amp; that the city Lycosura which <a id="l448"></a>was built by his son Lycaon was the oldest of all the <a id="l449"></a>cities either in the continent or in the Islands. <em class="underline">This,</em> <a id="l450"></a>saith he, <em class="underline">was the first city which the Sun ever saw <a id="l451"></a>&amp; after the pattern of this were other cities built.</em> <a id="l452"></a>He saith also that Lycaon gave the name of Lycæus <a id="l453"></a>to Iupiter &amp; instituted the Lupercalia to his honour:  &amp; slew an infant upon his altar, whence they feigned him transformed into a wolf. The Marble makes him contemporary to Pandion the grandfather of Theseus,  Others make him a little ancienter. Pausanias tells us that in the time of the <a id="l457"></a>sons of Lycaon  the whole region was much increased <a id="l458"></a>in  the number of cities &amp; people, &amp; that those <a id="l459"></a>his sons who were about 24 in number, shared his terri<a id="l460"></a>tories among them &amp; built each of them one or more <a id="l461"></a>cities the names of which he there sets down. Only <a id="l462"></a>Oenotrus who was the youngest of the brothers sailed <a id="l463"></a>thence with his people into Italy. And this is recconed <a id="l464"></a>the first colony which the Greeks sent abroad. The same <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> division of the kingdom of Lycaon amongst his sons is menti<a id="l465"></a>oned also by Dionysius Halycarnassæus. And by this instance <a id="l466"></a>you may understand how upon the first peopling of  <a id="l467"></a>Peloponnesus every father shared his territories amongst all <a id="l468"></a>his sons (as Moses describes) untill there was no more room <a id="l469"></a>for division. How these divisions united  afterward into <a id="l470"></a>greater polities,  Strabo has  given us the <a id="l471"></a>following instances. <sup class="note" id="n27-ref">[27]</sup> <em class="underline">Homer</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">calls all the places  which he <a id="l472"></a>reccons up in Peloponnesus, a few excepted, not cities but regions <a id="l473"></a>because each of them consisted of a convention of many</em> δήμοι <a id="l474"></a><em class="underline">free towns out of which afterwards noble cities were built and frequented: <a id="l475"></a>So the Argives composed Mantinea in Arcadia out of five <a id="l476"></a>  towns, &amp; Tegea out of nine. And out of so many was <a id="l477"></a>Heræa built by Cleombrotus or by Cleonymus. So also <a id="l478"></a>Ægium was built out of seven or eight  towns, Pa<a id="l479"></a>træ out of seven, Dyme out of eight: &amp; so  Elis <a id="l480"></a>was erected by the conflux of many towns into one city</em>. <a id="l481"></a>Here &amp; in some passages above, its plain that by the δήμοι out <a id="l482"></a>of which  cities arose, the Greeks mean towns of a middle <a id="l483"></a>degree between their cities &amp; villages.  Of <a id="l484"></a>such towns Herodotus tells you that all Media consisted <a id="l485"></a>till they built Ecbatane a city equal to  Athens, <a id="l486"></a>&amp; these towns the scripture as was said calls the cities of the Medes. How <a id="l487"></a>in Greece by erecting common councils with Prytanea such towns grew <a id="l488"></a>into cities &amp; cities into the seats of kingdoms, the councils ever drawing a <a id="l489"></a>conflux of people,  <a id="l490"></a>has been said above, &amp; will further appear by the rise <a id="l491"></a>of kingdoms in Italy. Some of these councils were without a <a id="l492"></a>king, as the Amphyctionick council of twelve Greek nations which <a id="l493"></a>met twice a yeare in spring  at Delphos  in the temple of Apollo &amp; in autumn at Thermopylæ in the Temple of  Ceres <a id="l494"></a>built for that purpose. All sorts of people met to sacrifice &amp; <a id="l495"></a>feast &amp; buy &amp; sell &amp; the Princes to consult about the com<a id="l496"></a>mon welfare of the nations.  One of the twelve nations were <a id="l498"></a>the Macedonians. They were not of this council in the <a id="l499"></a>beginning but were admitted afterwards in the room of <a id="l500"></a>the Phocians who were struck out for sacrilege. Iustin <a id="l501"></a>tells us <sup class="note" id="n28-ref">[28]</sup>  that the ancient Macedonia was a small region <a id="l502"></a>&amp; its people a branch of the Pelasgi &amp; Pliny saith<sup class="note" id="n29-ref">[29]</sup>  <a id="l503"></a>it was composed of 150  peoples. I suppose he means <a id="l504"></a> δήμοι towns. Out of these towns at length arose <a id="l505"></a>cities &amp; little kingdoms for Iustin tells us that when <a id="l506"></a>Caranus led a colony of Greeks thither (which  if to the  nine first kings of Macedonia we allow a reign of about twenty one years apiece was about  thirty years after the captivity of the ten tribes) he first seized <a id="l508"></a>the city Ædessa &amp; then expelling Midas the king of a certain <a id="l509"></a>part of Macedon &amp; afterwards other kings, he succeeded in the <a id="l510"></a>room of them all &amp; thus uniting the nations of various peoples <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span>  he first of all made one <a id="l511"></a> body of Macedonia &amp; founded that kingdom which at length <a id="l512"></a>by subduing first its neighbours then other nations propa<a id="l513"></a>gated its dominion to the furthest parts of the east.  Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup>  makes not Caranus but Perdiccas the son <a id="l515"></a>of Caranus to be the founder of this kingdom, &amp; describes <a id="l516"></a>the kings of those times poor &amp; mean below the degree <a id="l517"></a>of subjects in later ages, so that their meat was cookt <a id="l518"></a>for them by their own Queens. By conquering such kings <a id="l519"></a>either Caranus or Perdiccas became king of Macedon &amp; his successors at length <a id="l520"></a>by conquering all Greece &amp; the east erected the third Mo<a id="l521"></a>narchy.</p>
<p id="par16"> The rise of kingdoms in Italy was like that in <a id="l522"></a>other places. For Dionysius Halicarnassæus writes how <a id="l523"></a>the region where Rome was afterwards built was first <a id="l524"></a>peopled by barbarians called Siculi.  <em class="underline">This region</em>, saith he, <a id="l528"></a><em class="underline">was afterwards taken from them by a long war by <a id="l529"></a>the Aborigines who till then lived in the mountains <a id="l530"></a>in towns without walls spread all over the region, <a id="l531"></a>but after the Pelasgi &amp; other Greeks intermixed with <a id="l532"></a>them &amp; helped them in their war against their neigh<a id="l533"></a>bours, the Siculi being expelled, they compassed many <a id="l534"></a>cities with walls, &amp; became possest of all the territory <a id="l535"></a>between the two rivers Liris &amp; Tiber</em>. He speaks of <a id="l536"></a>the Aborigines &amp; Pelasgi here as of two peoples inter<a id="l537"></a>mixed, but a little after he takes them to be but <a id="l538"></a>two names of one &amp; the same people brought hither <a id="l539"></a>out of Peloponnesus by Oenotrus the Son of Lycaon <a id="l540"></a>as above, &amp; thus describes how in the beginning they <a id="l541"></a>peopled the western part of Italy.  <em class="underline">Oenotrus</em>, <a id="l542"></a>saith he, <em class="underline">having found a large region fit for pastu<a id="l543"></a>rage &amp; tillage but yet for the most part uninhabited, <a id="l544"></a>&amp; where it was inhabited peopled but thinly: in a <a id="l545"></a>certain part of it purged from the barbarians he <a id="l546"></a>built cities little &amp; numerous in the mountains: <a id="l547"></a>which manner of building was familiar to the ancients</em>. <a id="l548"></a>Then he tells us how after they were grown numerous <a id="l549"></a>so as to want room they made war upon the Siculi, as <a id="l550"></a>above &amp; forced them to leave Italy &amp; seat themselves <a id="l551"></a>in the next Island, which was ever since from them called <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span> Sicily. This was that war in which the Aborigines first <a id="l552"></a>compassed many cities with walls as above. Out of such <a id="l553"></a>cities as these arose afterwards divers kingdoms in Italy <a id="l554"></a>amongst which the Aborigines or Latines for a long time <a id="l555"></a>made but a small figure tho augmented by the new colonies of Ianus &amp; Saturnus &amp; Evander. They had a king before the <a id="l556"></a>Trojan war but without being united under him. For <a id="l557"></a>about 32 years after that war Ascanius the son of Æneas built the <a id="l558"></a>city Alba &amp; instituted there a Council of all the <a id="l559"></a>cities under him with sacrifices to Iupiter: in the time <a id="l560"></a>of which solemnity one of the young men of best note <a id="l561"></a>governed the city; &amp; this council was no doubt (like those <a id="l562"></a>of the Greeks) erected for uniting all the cities into one polity. <a id="l563"></a>The Vestal fire was also kept in Alba. This kingdom <a id="l564"></a>allowing their kings a reign of 21 years a piece one with another continued about 294 years  &amp; then Romulus with a few <a id="l565"></a>Latines laid the foundation of Rome about 20 miles <a id="l566"></a>from Alba. Strabo tells us<sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup>  that <em class="underline">the Æqui, Volsci, &amp; some <a id="l567"></a>Aborigines &amp; the Rutuli &amp; other greater and lesser <a id="l568"></a>cities dwelt about Rome when it was first built, &amp; <a id="l569"></a>that they dwelt there freely village by village without <a id="l570"></a>being subject to any common nation – &amp; that Romulus <a id="l571"></a>built Rome in a place assumed not by choice but <a id="l572"></a>by constraint which was neither fortified by nature nor <a id="l573"></a>had ground enough to supply the city nor men to in<a id="l574"></a>habit it. For the inhabitants of the region lived each <a id="l575"></a>apart &amp; reached to the very walls of the city &amp; re<a id="l576"></a>garded not the Albani. Such were Collatia, Antemnæ, <a id="l577"></a>Fidenæ, Lavinium &amp; other such like small cities not <a id="l578"></a>above 4 or 5 miles from Rome</em>. To get men there<a id="l579"></a>fore he built an Asylum which drew a conflux <a id="l580"></a>of people, &amp; with these he warred with the king of <a id="l581"></a>the Sabines at Lavinium &amp; by compact inherited his <a id="l582"></a>kingdom, &amp; being now grown strong it may be pre<a id="l583"></a>sumed that other little free cities round about easily <a id="l584"></a>complied with him. For Dionysius Halicarnassæus tells us <a id="l585"></a><sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup>  that this new kingdom as Romulus left it <em class="underline">consisted of <a id="l586"></a>thirty Courts or Councils in so many towns, each <a id="l587"></a>with the sacred fire kept in the Prytanæum of the <a id="l588"></a>Court for the Senators who met there to perform <a id="l589"></a>sacred rites after the manner of the Greeks. <a id="l590"></a>Whence the Senators were called <em class="underline">Curiales</em>. But <a id="l591"></a>when Numa the successor of Romulus reigned, he <a id="l592"></a>leaving the several fires in their own courts insti<a id="l593"></a>tuted one common to them all at Rome. – After<a id="l594"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013r"> &lt;13r&gt; </span>wards Servius Tullius, the feild being divided, as above, into about <a id="l595"></a>30 territories, on the hills &amp; such places as being fortified by the <a id="l596"></a>nature of the place might easily protect the husbandmen, he <a id="l597"></a>prepared refuges which the</em> Greeks call δημους. Hither every <a id="l598"></a>body fled out of the field when any enemies came &amp; here <a id="l599"></a>they often staid all night. These had also their magistrates <a id="l600"></a>to whose care it belonged to know the names of the husband<a id="l601"></a>men who contributed within the limits of that refuge, &amp; their <a id="l602"></a>farms whereby they got their living, &amp; as often as it was <a id="l603"></a>necessary to call the countrimen to their arms &amp; to lay <a id="l604"></a>a tax upon them those Magistrates called them together &amp; <a id="l605"></a>taxed them. And that the number of the country people <a id="l606"></a>might easily be known &amp; recconed he commanded them to <a id="l607"></a>build, &amp; dedicate Altars to the Gods who were inspectors &amp; <a id="l608"></a>keepers of the refuge; Which altars they should yearly <a id="l609"></a>honour with sacrifices being all assembled together, &amp; insti<a id="l610"></a>tuted a most honourable feast which they called the village-feast, <a id="l611"></a>&amp; wrote laws concerning those sacra which the Romans still <a id="l612"></a>observe. – Then being very desirous to unite and <a id="l613"></a>conjoyn the cities of the Latin nation into one body polytick <a id="l614"></a>least being weakned by intestine discords &amp; wars they should <a id="l615"></a>be deprived of their liberty by the neighbouring Barbarians <a id="l616"></a>he called together the chief men out of the several <a id="l617"></a>cities declaring to them for what great designe about their <a id="l618"></a>common advantage he had convened them. – And by this <a id="l619"></a>speech he perswaded them to build a Temple with an <a id="l620"></a>inviolable refuge at Rome at their common charge <a id="l621"></a>in which the people of all the cities being yearly assembled <a id="l622"></a>might perform publick &amp; private sacrifices &amp; buy &amp; sell <a id="l623"></a>at set times. And if any quarrel or difference arose <a id="l624"></a>between them it might be determined at these sacra, the <a id="l625"></a>decision of the controversy being permitted to the arbitri<a id="l626"></a>ment of the rest of the cities. He built therefore at the <a id="l627"></a>common charge of the cities the Temple of Diana in <a id="l628"></a>the hill Aventinus &amp; wrote the laws of the compact <a id="l629"></a>made between these people in a pillar of brass which remains <a id="l630"></a>to this day being erected in the Temple of Diana &amp; has the <a id="l631"></a>characters of the Greek letters which the Greeks used of old. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> Thus far Dionysius. By this unquestionable record you may <a id="l632"></a>see how difficult it was to unite the divided cities into one <a id="l633"></a>polity. You have also in the refuges or fortified towns a specimen <a id="l634"></a>of the first cities &amp; kingdoms into which men convened when they <a id="l635"></a>began to make war upon one another</p>
<p id="par17"> For better understanding the ancient state of Greece &amp; <a id="l636"></a>Italy, the Chronology of those times is to be rectified. ffor <a id="l637"></a>the Europeans had no Chronology ancienter then the Persian <a id="l638"></a>Monarchy. And whatever Chronology we have now of ancienter <a id="l639"></a>times has been framed since by reasoning &amp; conjecture. <a id="l640"></a>Pherecides Atheniensis in the reign of Darius Hystaspis or soon <a id="l641"></a>after wrote a large book of the Antiquities &amp; ancient Genea<a id="l642"></a>logies of the Athenians &amp; was one of the first European <a id="l643"></a>writers of this kind, whence he had the name of Genealogus <a id="l644"></a>And by these Genealogies the Greeks estimated times past but <a id="l645"></a>computed not by any Æra till about the end of the Persian <a id="l646"></a>Monarchy.

<p id="par21"> Also after Orestes &amp; Tisamenes there reigned at Argos <a id="l734"></a>Temenus &amp; six others successively the last of which was Phidon <a id="l735"></a>who instituted weights &amp; measures &amp; coyned money in Ægina. <a id="l736"></a>He was the brother of Caranus the founder of the Kingdom <a id="l737"></a>of Macedon &amp; between Caranus &amp; Alexander king of Macedon <a id="l738"></a>(that king who according to Eusebius began his reign in the <a id="l739"></a>19<sup>th</sup> year of Darius Hystaspis) there were nine successive kings <a id="l740"></a>of Macedon so that between the death of Ægisthus &amp; the 19<sup>th</sup> <a id="l741"></a>year of Darius there were 18 successive reigns all which <a id="l742"></a>at 21 years to a reign make 378 years &amp; these years <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017r"> &lt;17r&gt; </span> counted backward place the beginning of the reign of Orestes <a id="l743"></a>100 years after the death of Solomon: at which rate the de<a id="l744"></a>struction of Troy will be about 90 years after the death <a id="l745"></a>of that king.</p>
<p id="par22"> Again from Æsculapius to Hippocrates inclusively are <a id="l746"></a>recconed 18 male generations by the fathers side &amp; 19 <a id="l747"></a>generations by the mothers side. And because these generati<a id="l748"></a>ons being taken notice of in History were most probably by the <a id="l749"></a>principal of the family &amp; so for the most part by the eldest <a id="l750"></a>sons, we may reccon about 25 or 30 years to a generation. <a id="l751"></a>And thus the 17 intervals by the fathers side &amp; 18 by the <a id="l752"></a>mothers will at a middle recconing amount to about 481 <a id="l753"></a>years, which counted backwards from the middle of the reign <a id="l754"></a>of Artaxerxes Longimanus when Hippocrates flourished will <a id="l755"></a>reach up to the 55<sup>th</sup> year after the death of Solomon. <a id="l756"></a>And therefore Æsculapius &amp; Hercules (whose sons were at <a id="l757"></a>the Trojan war) flourished about that time &amp; the  destruction of Troy which was one generation later was about 88 years <a id="l759"></a>after the death of Solomon.</p>
<p id="par23"> And this agrees with the recconing of those Historians whom <a id="l760"></a>Virgil followed in making Æneas &amp; Dido contemporary. ffor <a id="l761"></a>Iosephus out of the Tyrian Annals tells us that Dido fled <a id="l762"></a>to Afric &amp; built Carthage in the seventh year of her <a id="l763"></a>brother Pigmalion king of Tyre that is 90 years after <a id="l764"></a>the death of Solomon. Some old writers (as Philistus &amp; <a id="l765"></a>Appian) have represented Carthage built even before the <a id="l766"></a>destruction of Troy &amp; Strabo seems to make it built soon <a id="l767"></a>after. <em class="underline">They celebrate</em>, saith he,<sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup>  <em class="underline">the dominon of Minos <a id="l768"></a>over the sea &amp; the navigation of the Phœnicians who <a id="l769"></a>went beyond Hercules's pillars &amp; built cities there &amp; in <a id="l770"></a>the middle of the sea coasts of Afric presently after the <a id="l771"></a>war of Troy.</em> Vpon these &amp; such like authorities Virgil <a id="l772"></a>seems to have grownded the Synchronism.  For Teucer after the destruction of Troy <a id="l774"></a>being barred by his father Telamon from returning home into <a id="l775"></a>the Island Salamis sailed to Cyprus &amp; there built a new city which <a id="l776"></a>he called Salamis &amp;  marrying the daughter of Cinyras he &amp; his posterity reigned there till Artaxerxes <a id="l777"></a> Mnemon king of Persia took Cyprus from Evagoras the last of that <a id="l778"></a>race . <sup class="note" id="n40-ref">[40]</sup> Also Agapenor the captain of the Arcadians after the <a id="l779"></a>destruction of Troy sailed to Cyprus &amp; built there a new Paphus <a id="l780"></a>&amp; temple of Venus about sixty furlongs from the old Paphus built <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span> by Cinyras.

It seems they did it by the <a id="l783"></a>assistance of Belus; for he &amp; his son Pigmalion reigned over <a id="l784"></a>Cyprus or some part thereof &amp; built the cities Citium, <a id="l785"></a>Lapethus &amp; Carpatia,<sup class="note" id="n42-ref">[42]</sup>  &amp; Virgil introduces Dido speaking thus.</p>

<p id="par24" class="i0">Servius adds: Cyprum subactam Belus concessit Teucro ut in ea <a id="l786"></a>collocaret imperium. Belus therefore took Cyprus from Cinyras <a id="l787"></a>&amp; there gave seats to the Greeks who assisted him. Servius <a id="l788"></a>tells us that this Belus was called Methres &amp; Iosephus calls <a id="l789"></a>him Matgenus. According to the Tyrian Annals he reigned <a id="l790"></a>nine years &amp; died 83 years after Solomon. Whence it <a id="l791"></a>follows that Troy was taken about 70 or 80 years after <a id="l792"></a>Solomon's death.</p>
<p id="par25"> Altho the Greeks &amp; Latins had no certain Chronology an<a id="l793"></a>cienter then the Persian Monarchy yet the Phœnicians had <a id="l794"></a>Annals as ancient as the days of David. And Tatian<sup class="note" id="n43-ref">[43]</sup>  in his <a id="l795"></a>book against the Greeks relates that amongst the Phœnici<a id="l796"></a>ans flourished three ancient historians, <em class="underline">Theodotus</em> <em class="underline">Hypsicra<a id="l797"></a>tes</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Mochus</em> who all of them delivered in their Histo<a id="l798"></a>ries (translated into Greek by Lætus) that under one of the Kings (that is one of the Kings <a id="l799"></a>of Phœnicia) happened the rapture of Europa the voyage <a id="l800"></a>of Menalaus into Phœnicia &amp; the league &amp; friendship <a id="l801"></a>between Hiram &amp; Solomon when Hiram gave his daughter <a id="l802"></a>to Solomon &amp; supplied him with timber for building the <a id="l803"></a>Temple:  and that the same is affirmed by Menander of Pergamus.  And so Lætus <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n44-ref">[44]</sup> conjoyns <a id="l804"></a>the voyage of Menalaus with that  league of Solomon <a id="l805"></a>&amp; Hiram. But while the Historians allow no more time <a id="l806"></a>then the reign of one king between the rapture of Europa <a id="l807"></a>&amp; the voyage of Menalaus it seems to me that they found <a id="l808"></a>only the rapture of Europa in the Annals of the Pheni<a id="l809"></a>cians, &amp; by conjecture subjoyned the voyage of Menalaus <a id="l810"></a>as a thing which happend soon after. ffor that voyage  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span> was not of such moment to the Phenicians that they <a id="l811"></a>should record it, but Agenors losing his daughter and <a id="l812"></a>sending his sons in quest of her affected them. For <a id="l813"></a>Lucian tells us<sup class="note" id="n45-ref">[45]</sup>  that the Sidonians built a Temple to <a id="l814"></a>Europa &amp; used money with her effigies sitting upon a <a id="l815"></a>Bull. If they had her memory in so much honour it <a id="l816"></a>may well be supposed that they entered her story in <a id="l817"></a>their Annals &amp; the league between Solomon &amp; Hiram <a id="l818"></a>was certainly entered Iosephus mentioning it out of the <a id="l819"></a>Annals of Tyre. The Phenician Historians therefore con<a id="l820"></a>joyned the rapture of Europa with the League between <a id="l821"></a>Hiram &amp; Solomon because in the Annals of their country they found them together <a id="l822"></a>or within the short compass of a kings reign, &amp; thence <a id="l823"></a>we may conclude that the rapture of Europa happen<a id="l824"></a>ed about the beginning of Solomons reign or some <a id="l825"></a>time in Davids. Now Eteocles &amp; Polynices the sons <a id="l826"></a>of Oedipus the son of Laius the son of Labdacus the <a id="l827"></a>son of Polydorus the son of Cadmus &amp; Harmonia slew <a id="l828"></a>one another in the war of the seven captains at Thebes <a id="l829"></a>&amp; ten years after <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n46-ref">[46]</sup> Thersander the young son of Polynices took <a id="l830"></a>Thebes from Laodamas the young son of Eteocles &amp; was <a id="l831"></a>soon after slain by Telephus in going to the war at <a id="l832"></a>Troy in the sixt <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n47-ref">[47]</sup>  or seventh year of that war. These six generations by the eldest sons between <a id="l833"></a>the coming of Cadmus into Europe &amp; the war of Troy <a id="l834"></a>could scarce take up less time then  140 years, <a id="l835"></a>which together with the  four last years of that war <a id="l836"></a>being counted from about the  tenth or twentieth year of Davids reign <a id="l837"></a>will place the taking of Troy   about 80 years later <a id="l838"></a>then the death of Solomon as above. If Cadmus fled from Sidon with his wife Harmonia as the Sidonians <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n48-ref">[48]</sup>  relate, his  son Polydorus might be born some years before he fled.</p>
<p id="par26"> This recconing is further confirmed by considering that <a id="l839"></a>the war of Troy by the consent of all antiquity was later <a id="l840"></a>then the reign of Sesostris &amp; fell in with the latter end of the reign <a id="l841"></a>of Memnon. For Sesostris was Sesak who reigned in the days of <a id="l842"></a>Solomon &amp; Rehoboam &amp; Memnon  died about 85 or 90 years <a id="l843"></a>after the death of Solomon as we shall shew hereafter.</p>
<p id="par27"> So then Greece continued divided into many small govern<a id="l844"></a>ments till after the days of Solomon &amp; if we should suppose <a id="l845"></a>the Argonautick expedition to be 35 or 40 years older then the <a id="l846"></a>taking of Troy &amp; the rapture of Europa &amp; coming of Cadmus into <a id="l847"></a>Europe to be 100 years older then that expedition &amp; Cecrops, Pho<a id="l848"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span>roneus, Selex &amp; Lycaon to be as old or a generation or <a id="l849"></a>two older then Cadmus, yet the first building of cities <a id="l850"></a>in Europe &amp; uniting them into little polities &amp; the first <a id="l851"></a>use of letters would scarce be older then the days of Samu<a id="l852"></a>el Saul &amp; David. Till then the Greeks lived either without <a id="l853"></a>houses or in villages of huts<sup class="note" id="n49-ref">[49]</sup>  &amp; fed upon the spontaneous fruits of the <a id="l854"></a>earth without planting of trees without plowing &amp; sowing <a id="l855"></a>without wine or beer without commerce or money, without <a id="l856"></a>laws or letters &amp; even without fixed seats being in perpetual <a id="l857"></a>arms &amp; often changing their seats as they drave out one <a id="l858"></a>another by force or sought a better soyle untill at <a id="l859"></a>length the villages combined to wall in some towns to <a id="l860"></a>which they might fly in case of danger &amp; these towns <a id="l861"></a>united   <a id="l862"></a>into bigger  polities whose <a id="l863"></a>first kings gave their names to the people &amp; countries they <a id="l864"></a>reigned over, as Achæus to Achaia, Ion to Ionia, Cecrops to <a id="l865"></a>Cecropia, Pelasgus to the Pelasgi, Pelops to Peloponesus,  <a id="l866"></a>Hellen to the Hellenes, Dorus to the Dores, Danaus to the Da<a id="l867"></a>nai, Atthis to Attica, Arcas to Arcadia &amp;c. And this I <a id="l868"></a>take to be the reason why Greece was at first so very <a id="l869"></a>much divided &amp; did nothing in common before the war <a id="l870"></a>of Troy. How mean the towns &amp; cities were in those <a id="l871"></a>days may be understood by Ovids description of old Rome</p> <sup class="note" id="n50-ref">[50]</sup>

<p id="par29"> The Franks &amp; Britains continued divided into many <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021r"> &lt;21r&gt; </span> small kingdoms till Iulius Cæsar invaded them &amp; the ancient <a id="l874"></a>constitution of Spain was like that of the other nations.

This haughtiness prevailed <a id="l882"></a>chiefly among the Spaniards being accompanied also with <a id="l883"></a>their crafty nature &amp; double mindedness. For they following <a id="l884"></a>a treacherous &amp; thievish way of  life, being bold in <a id="l885"></a>little things but attempting nothing great, neglected the <a id="l886"></a>acquisition of great power &amp; society. ffor if they would have <a id="l887"></a>combined to defend themselves by their joynt forces, the <a id="l888"></a>Carthaginians could not by an incursion have conquered <a id="l889"></a>the greater part of Spain without opposition, nor before <a id="l890"></a>them the Tyrians &amp; Celti who are now called Celtiberi <a id="l891"></a>&amp; Verones, nor afterwards the thieves Variatho &amp; Serto<a id="l892"></a>rius &amp; if any others designed a greater dominion.

<p id="par30"> What Strabo tells us of the Greek Colonies may be easily <a id="l897"></a>applied to the Phenician, namely that they by reason of <a id="l898"></a>the smalness &amp; weakness of the ancient kingdoms easily conquered <a id="l899"></a>wherever they pleased to seat themselves.

<p id="par32"> The great antiquity of the kingdom of Egypt makes it <a id="l922"></a>difficult to give an account of its original but some foot <a id="l923"></a>steps there are therof in history. For the kingdom of Egypt <a id="l924"></a>under which Israel was in bondage seems to have compre<a id="l925"></a>hended but a smal part of Egypt as well because in  two <a id="l926"></a>days time the children of Israel were scattered throughout all <a id="l927"></a>the land of this kingdom to gather straw (Exod. 5.12, 14) <a id="l928"></a>as because the king of this kingdom said that the children <a id="l929"></a>of Israel were more &amp; mightier then his people (Exod. l.<a id="l930"></a>9 Psal. 105.24) Which is an argument that Egypt then <a id="l931"></a>consisted of several small kingdoms of which this was but one.</p>
<p id="par33"> In the seven years of plenty Ioseph laid up the corn <a id="l932"></a>in the cities of Egypt, the corn of the feild which was round <a id="l933"></a>about every city laid he up in the same Gen 41.48. And <a id="l934"></a>therefore the cities of Egypt being in those days the places <a id="l935"></a>in which the Egyptians inned their harvests they must <a id="l936"></a>have been not much further asunder then our villages <a id="l937"></a>&amp; by consequence as numerous &amp; small as the ancient <a id="l938"></a>cities of Syria &amp; δήμοι of the Medes &amp; Greeks. Which is <a id="l939"></a>an argument that the first constitution of Egypt was <a id="l940"></a>like that of other nations. For these cities like the <a id="l941"></a>δήμοι of Greece united under Common Councils &amp; <a id="l942"></a>thereby grew into kingdoms.</p>

<p id="par35"> This was peculiar to the Egyptians that they worshipped <a id="l980"></a>their Gods not in the images of men like the other nations <a id="l981"></a>but in those of various beasts.<sup class="note" id="n59-ref">[59]</sup>  <em class="underline">The temples of Egypt</em>, saith <a id="l982"></a> Lucian,<sup class="note" id="n60-ref">[60]</sup>  <em class="underline">are beautiful &amp; large being built of costly stones <a id="l983"></a>but if you seek a God within you will find either an Ape <a id="l984"></a>or a Stork or a Swallow or a Cat</em>. To represent things <a id="l985"></a>by Hieroglyphicks was the sacred language of the ancient Egyp<a id="l986"></a>tians, &amp; the Birds Beasts &amp; ffishes which they worshipped are <a id="l987"></a>nothing else then the Hiergoglyphicks symbols or banners of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024r"> &lt;24r&gt; </span> their first kings &amp; their worshipping them was certainly <a id="l988"></a>older then the days of Moses because described &amp; prohibited <a id="l989"></a>in the second Commandment. <em class="underline">Thou shalt not make to <a id="l990"></a>thyself any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above <a id="l991"></a>or in the earth beneath or in the waters below the <a id="l992"></a>earth thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve them</em> <a id="l993"></a>(Exod. 20) that is thou shalt not make nor worship the <a id="l994"></a>likeness or image of any fowle in the heaven or beast <a id="l995"></a>or insect or plant in the earth or fish in the waters as thy <a id="l996"></a>fathers worshipped them in Egypt Deut 4.16, 17, 18. Iosh. <a id="l997"></a>24.14. When therefore we are told<sup class="note" id="n61-ref">[61]</sup>  that the Egyptians <a id="l998"></a>worshipped a Crocodile in Arsinoe, the Ichneumon in the <a id="l999"></a>city of Hercules, an Eagle &amp; a Ram in Thebes, a Goat <a id="l1000"></a>&amp; the God Pan in the temple of the Mendesians, a sheep <a id="l1001"></a>in Saïs, a Cat &amp; Diana in Bubastis, a Dog &amp; Mercury in <a id="l1002"></a>Cynopolis, the fish Oxyrinchus in the city Oxyrinchus, the <a id="l1003"></a>fish Latus in Latopolis, a wolf in Lycopolis, a Cynocephalus <a id="l1004"></a>or Ape in Hermopolis, a Lyon in Leontopolis, a Mouse <a id="l1005"></a>&amp; spider in Athribis &amp; other creatures in other cities: <a id="l1006"></a>we are to understand that in these symbols the several <a id="l1007"></a>cities worshipped their founders &amp; first kings &amp; that this <a id="l1008"></a>worship was older then Moses &amp; even as old as the Idolatry <a id="l1009"></a>of Egypt. By the founders of cities I mean not their <a id="l1010"></a>first inhabitants but those who erected Common Coun<a id="l1011"></a>cils in them &amp; thereby or by conquest founded their dominion over <a id="l1012"></a>other cities &amp; built them accordingly. The worship<a id="l1013"></a>ping of such kings gave the first beginning to idolatry <a id="l1014"></a>in Egypt Chaldea &amp; the neighbouring nations from <a id="l1015"></a>whom it spread into Europe &amp; other places. And the <a id="l1016"></a>multitude of cities in Egypt which had their several <a id="l1017"></a>Temples, Gods, Conventions, High Priests &amp; modes of worship <a id="l1018"></a>argues the multitude of kingdoms &amp; nations in Egypt <a id="l1019"></a>when idolatry began.</p>
<p id="par36"> The manner how the first cities of Egypt <a id="l1020"></a>grew into kingdoms will be best understood by the <a id="l1021"></a>constitution of the kingdom of Athens. For the Athe<a id="l1022"></a>nians were a colony of Egypt and Cecrops the first <a id="l1023"></a>king of Athens was an Egyptian of the Nome or <a id="l1024"></a>Province of Sais, &amp; formed that kingdom after the <a id="l1025"></a>mode of the Egyptian kingdoms <sup>a</sup>.<sup class="note" id="n62-ref">[62]</sup>  He taught Athens the <a id="l1026"></a>worship of the Egyptian Goddess Minerva who was wor<a id="l1027"></a>shipped in Sais. He distinguished the people into three <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025r"> &lt;25r&gt; </span> orders the Gentry soldiers &amp; Mechanicks as the Egyptians <a id="l1028"></a>did, for the Egyptian Gentry were their Priests. He ordeined <a id="l1029"></a>that the soldiers should be husbandmen &amp; till all the land <a id="l1030"></a>in time of peace as the soldiers did in Egypt. He first <a id="l1031"></a>joyned one man &amp; one woman according to a law in Egypt <a id="l1032"></a>ordeined by Vulcan. He first introduced the Egyptian Gods <a id="l1033"></a>among the Greeks, &amp; as the Egyptian Priests wore <a id="l1034"></a>linnen garments so did the Athenian. And, saith Diodorus,<sup class="note" id="n63-ref">[63]</sup>  <a id="l1035"></a>the sacrifices &amp; ancient customes of the Athenians &amp; <a id="l1036"></a>Egyptians were alike. Now whilst he thus imitated <a id="l1037"></a>the Egyptian customes in other things we may reccon <a id="l1038"></a>that he imitated them also in the Athenian polity <a id="l1039"></a>of uniting many δήμοι &amp; little cities into greater <a id="l1040"></a>polities by Common Councils. For  Pliny tells us<sup class="note" id="n64-ref">[64]</sup>  that the people of Attica were the <a id="l1042"></a>first among the Greeks who thus united &amp;  <a id="l1043"></a>Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n65-ref">[65]</sup>  that the Greeks in those things followed <a id="l1044"></a>the example of the Egyptians.</p>
<p id="par37"> It was the custome of the first ages for every <a id="l1045"></a>king to have in his city a Prytaneum or place of <a id="l1046"></a>publick worship for his people. And if any cities <a id="l1047"></a>united into one polity under any common city they erected <a id="l1048"></a>a common Prytaneum in that city without abolishing the <a id="l1049"></a>particular ones. This was done in Italy after the <a id="l1050"></a>example of the Greeks &amp; in Greece after the exam<a id="l1051"></a>ple of the Egyptians. And as the Prytanea in the <a id="l1052"></a>several cities of Greece were the remains of ancient <a id="l1053"></a>kingdoms so were the temples conventions &amp; religions in <a id="l1054"></a>Egypt. So when we are told that Ioseph married the <a id="l1055"></a>daughter of Potiphera Priest of On, we may under<a id="l1056"></a>stand that On had been once the Metropolis of a <a id="l1057"></a>kingdom but before Ioseph's days the Priests of On <a id="l1058"></a>lost their dominion as kings &amp; became subject to <a id="l1059"></a>the kings of another city. And the like of as many <a id="l1060"></a>other cities as had Temples or Prytaneums without <a id="l1061"></a>kings &amp; also of the smaller cities whose Prytaneums <a id="l1062"></a>were disused &amp; extinct. For as in Greece when <a id="l1063"></a>single cities became united into bigger kingdoms, their <a id="l1064"></a>Prytaneums in time became disused &amp; the common Pry<a id="l1065"></a>taneum in the capital city only remained, so it is to <a id="l1066"></a>be understood of Egypt.</p>
<p id="par38"> These capital cities with their Prytaneums &amp; Conven<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span>tions seem to have laid the foundation of the Nomes or Nations <a id="l1067"></a>of Egypt, every Nome having a capital city with a Temple <a id="l1068"></a>&amp; Priest &amp; God &amp; annual Conventions for the whole Nome <a id="l1069"></a>&amp; a Iudge for doing justice: so that the Nomes seem to be <a id="l1070"></a>the remains of ancient kingdoms, the Priests of the capital <a id="l1071"></a>cities retaining their Priesthood long after they lost their <a id="l1072"></a>armies &amp; power as kings. For in the first ages all kings were <a id="l1073"></a>High Priests &amp; Iudges till they became subject to other kings <a id="l1074"></a>more potent then themselves. These little kingdoms of Egypt <a id="l1075"></a>began to grow into bigger kingdoms before the days of Ioseph <a id="l1076"></a>&amp; by degrees grew into one Monarchy before the days of <a id="l1077"></a>Solomon &amp; then Sesak made a new regulation of the Nomes <a id="l1078"></a>&amp; built their Temples more sumptuously. </p>
<p id="par39"> One of the first great kingdoms in the world was that <a id="l1080"></a>of Egypt. For Pliny <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n66-ref">[66]</sup>  in recconing up the first inventors of <a id="l1081"></a>things ascribes to the Egyptians the invention of a royal City <a id="l1082"></a>&amp; to the inhabitants of Attica that of a popular one. Which <a id="l1083"></a>is as much as to say that Athens was by the Greeks accounted <a id="l1084"></a>the first city in the world under which other cities united <a id="l1085"></a>into a popular dominion by a Common Council &amp; the Egyp<a id="l1086"></a>tian Thebes the first City which became the seat of a <a id="l1087"></a> Monarchy. For Thebes was famous in Homers <a id="l1088"></a>days when the four Monarchies &amp; their head cities were <a id="l1089"></a>not yet talked of. For, saith Strabo, <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n67-ref">[67]</sup>  <em class="underline">Homer knew nothing <a id="l1090"></a>of the Empires of the Medes &amp; Assyrians, otherwise <a id="l1091"></a>naming <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n68-ref">[68]</sup>  the Egyptian Thebes &amp; her riches &amp; those of the <a id="l1092"></a>Phenicians, he would not have passed over in silence the <a id="l1093"></a>riches of Babylon, Nineveh &amp; Ecbatane</em>. And for the same reason Memphis also  &amp; its miracles grew up after Homers days.. We have shewn <a id="l1094"></a>how the cities of Egypt united very early  into small <a id="l1095"></a>kingdoms, &amp; how those kingdoms grew at length into one <a id="l1096"></a>Monarchy seated first at Thebes &amp; then at Memphys remains now to be explained.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p026v"> &lt;26v&gt; </span>
