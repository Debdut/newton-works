        <p id="par1">The Apocalyps of Iohn  is written in the same style &amp; language with the <a id="l2"></a>prophesies of Daniel &amp; hath the same relation to them which they have to one <a id="l3"></a>another so that all of them together make but one complete prophesy; &amp; in <a id="l4"></a>like manner it consists of two parts, an introductory Prophesy &amp; an interpretation <a id="l5"></a>thereof.</p>
        <p id="par2">The Prophesy is distinguished into seven successive parts by the opening of <a id="l6"></a>the seven seales of the book which  Daniel was commanded to seal up, <a id="l7"></a>&amp; thence it is called the Apocalyps. And the time of the seventh <a id="l8"></a>seale  is subdivided into eight  successive parts by the silence in heaven for <a id="l9"></a>half an hour &amp; the sounding of seven trumpets successively. And the seventh <a id="l10"></a>trumpet sounds to the battel of the great day of God Almighty whereby the kingdoms <a id="l11"></a>of this world become the kingdoms of God &amp;  his Christ  <a id="l12"></a>&amp; those are destroyed that destroyed  the earth.</p>
        <p id="par3">The Interpretation begins with the words: <em class="underline">And the temple of God was opened <a id="l13"></a>in heaven &amp; there was seen in his temple the Ark of his testament.</em> And it continues <a id="l14"></a>to the end of the prophesy. For the temple is the scene of the visions  &amp; the <a id="l15"></a>visions in the temple relate to the feast of the seventh month. For the feasts of the Iews were <a id="l16"></a>typical of things to come. The Passover related to the first coming of Christ &amp;  <a id="l17"></a> the feast of the seventh month to his second coming; &amp; his first coming <a id="l18"></a>being past before this prophesy was given, the feast of the seventh month is here <a id="l19"></a>alluded unto.</p>
        <p id="par4">Upon the first day of the seventh month in the morning the High Priest dressed the Lamps. And in <a id="l20"></a>allusion thereunto, this Prophesy begins with a vision of one like the son of man in <a id="l21"></a>the High Priests habit appearing as it were  in the midst of the seven golden <a id="l22"></a>candlesticks, or over against the midst of them, dressing the lamps, which appeared <a id="l23"></a>like a rod of seven stars in his right hand. He dresses them by seven admonitory epis<a id="l24"></a>tles sent to the Angels or Bishops of the seven churches of Asia which in the primitive <a id="l25"></a>times illuminated the Temple or Church catholic.</p>
        <p id="par5"> After the lamps were dressed Iohn is called up to the morning sacrifice <a id="l26"></a> &amp; sees the door of the Temple opened, &amp;  a throne (the ark of <a id="l27"></a>the testament) &amp; one sitting upon it  representing God  as it were sitting above the Ark between the cherubims &amp; 24 seats about the throne (the chambers of the 24 princes of <a id="l29"></a>the Priests in the priestly court) &amp; out of the throne proceeded lightnings &amp; thundrings <a id="l30"></a>&amp; voices (the flashes of the fire upon the altar, &amp; the thundring voices of those that <a id="l31"></a>sounded the trumpets &amp; sung at the sacrifices: for these things being done between Iohn &amp; the <a id="l32"></a>throne the  lightnights &amp; thundrings &amp; voices might seem to him to come out of the throne. And there were seven <a id="l33"></a>lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God, or Angels of <a id="l34"></a>the Churches represented before by the seven stars. And before the throne was <a id="l35"></a>a sea of glass like unto Chrystal, the  brazen sea full of clear water. And <a id="l36"></a>in the midst of the throne &amp; round about the throne  that is before &amp; behind <a id="l37"></a>as it were in the midst of the throne &amp; on either side of the throne, as it were in the circuit  <a id="l38"></a> thereof were four beasts full of eyes representing <a id="l39"></a>the people in the four sides of the great court. And these Beasts were ones to the east like a lyon one to the west  <a id="l40"></a>like a calf west, a man southward, &amp; a flying eagle northward these being the four:  standards of the tribes of Israel encamped on the four sides of <a id="l41"></a>the Tabernacle in the wilderness. See Num. II. &amp; Ezek. I. And they rest not day &amp; night (at the <a id="l42"></a>morning &amp; evening sacrifices saying Holy holy holy Lord God almighty which was &amp; is &amp; is to come. And <a id="l43"></a>when those beasts give glory &amp; honour &amp; thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for <a id="l44"></a>ever &amp; ever, the fourt &amp; twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne &amp; worship <a id="l45"></a>him that liveth for ever &amp; ever. For  so soon as the worship of the people was ended <a id="l46"></a>the Princes of the Priests went into the temple &amp; there fell down &amp; worshipped.</p>
        <p id="par6">And Iohn saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written <a id="l47"></a>within &amp; on the backside sealed with seven seales (the book which Daniel was commanded to seale <a id="l48"></a>up, &amp; which is here represented by the book of the law laid up  in the  side of <a id="l49"></a>the Ark as it were in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. For the festivals &amp; ceremonies of the law prescribed  the people in this book adumbrated the the same prophe<a id="l51"></a>sy with the book of Daniel) And none was found worthy to open the book till the Lamb of god appeared, the great high <a id="l52"></a>priest represented by a lamb slain at the foot of the altar in the morning sacrifice. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span> And he came &amp; took the book out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne. For the <a id="l53"></a> High Priest in the feast of the seventh month went into the most holy place &amp; took <a id="l54"></a>the book of the law out of the right side of the Ark to read it to the people. And in order to <a id="l55"></a>read it well he studied it seven days, that is, upon the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>t</sup>, 6<sup>t</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> 8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> &amp; 10<sup>th</sup> day in the morning <a id="l56"></a>being attended by some of the chief Priests. And these seven days are  alluded unto by the Lamb's opening the <a id="l57"></a>seven seales successively.</p>
        
            <p id="par8">Upon the tenth day of the month two Goats were brought into temple to reprent <a id="l66"></a>the people, one the elect the other the reprobate. And lots were cast upon them, &amp; Gods <a id="l67"></a>lot was sacrificed to him &amp; the other Goat called Azazeal or the scape goat was sent <a id="l68"></a>into the wilderness loaded with the sins of the people. And  as the people went home from the temple they said to one another, God seale <a id="l70"></a>you to a good new year. And in allusion to all this the twelve tribes of Israel are now <a id="l71"></a>divided into two lots. One the 144000 which are sealed out of all the twelve tribes of <a id="l72"></a>Israel with the seale of God in their foreheads: the other the remainder of the twelve tribes. One the <a id="l73"></a>remnant of the womans seed which keep the commandments of God &amp; have the <a id="l74"></a>testimony of Iesus &amp; remain on mount Sion with the name of God on their foreheads <a id="l75"></a>&amp; become the two witnesses &amp; at length put on sackcloth &amp; prophesy 1260 days in <a id="l76"></a>sackcloth: &amp; the other the woman who flees from the temple into the wilderness <a id="l77"></a>together with those who receive the mark of the beast &amp; worship him image, &amp; arrives <a id="l78"></a>at her place of riches honour &amp; dominion upon the back of her beast when the two witness put <a id="l79"></a>on sackcloth, &amp; reigns over him all the time that they prophesy in sackcloth. [This beast is Daniels <a id="l80"></a>fourth Beast; &amp; the woman is the little horn of that Beast with eyes &amp; a mouth. And <a id="l81"></a>the Dragon is Daniels Hee-Goat: that is the whole Roman Empire untill it becomes divided <a id="l82"></a>into the Greek &amp; Latine Empires; &amp; from the time of that division he is the Greek Empire <a id="l83"></a>alone. And the image of the Beast is a council against the seven churches of Asia.]</p>
        <p id="par9">Upon the same tenth day of the month a bull was offered for the sins of the people. <a id="l84"></a>And the High Priest in his linen garments took a cancer full of burning coales of fire <a id="l85"></a>from the golden Altar, &amp; his hands full of sweet  incense beaten sin all &amp; went into the <a id="l86"></a>most holy place within the vaile &amp; sprinkled the blood of the bullock with his finger <a id="l87"></a>upon the mercy seal eastward seven times: &amp; then killed the Goat which fell to Gods lot <a id="l88"></a>for the sin offering &amp; brought his blook within the vail &amp; sprinkled it also upon the <a id="l89"></a>mercy seat &amp; before the mercy seat. And then he went out to the Altar &amp; sprinkled <a id="l90"></a>it also seven times with the blood of the bullock, &amp; as often with the blood of the Goat. And <a id="l91"></a>after this, he laid both his hands upon the head of the scape Goat, &amp; confessed over him all the <a id="l92"></a>iniquities of the children of Israel, &amp; all their transgressions in all their sins, putting <a id="l93"></a>them upon the head of the goat, &amp; sent him into the wilderness. And while the <a id="l94"></a>High-priest was doing these things in the most holy place &amp; at the altar, the people <a id="l95"></a>continued in silence at their devotion. And to this alludes the silence in heaven for half <a id="l96"></a>an hour, which followed upon opening the seventh seal, &amp; the incense offered with the prayers of the saints upon the golden altar. Whence you may understand <a id="l97"></a>that this silence &amp; incense is synchronal to the sealing of the 144000.</p>
        <p id="par10">The the High priest went into the holy place &amp; put off his linnen garments <a id="l98"></a>&amp; put on other garments, &amp; came out, &amp; sent the bullock &amp; the Goat of the sin offering <a id="l99"></a>to be burnt without the camp. And a censer was filled with fire of the Altar, &amp; <a id="l100"></a>carred out with them &amp; cast on the  earth to burn them. And to this alludes the <a id="l101"></a>Angels filling a censer with fire of the altar &amp; casting it to the earth, whereupon <a id="l102"></a>followed voices &amp; thunderings (of the musick of the temple) &amp; lightnings (of the sacred fire) &amp; <a id="l103"></a>an earthquake.</p>
        <p id="par11">Upon the fifteenth day of the month, &amp; the six following days there were very <a id="l104"></a>great sacrifices. And in allusion to the sounding of the trumpets &amp; singing with thundering <a id="l105"></a>voices, &amp; pouring out drink offerings at those sacrifices, seven Trumpets are sounded &amp; <a id="l106"></a>seven thunders utter their voices, &amp; seven Vials of wrath are poured out. And therefore <a id="l107"></a>the sounding of the seven trumpets, the voices of the seven thunders, &amp; the pouring out <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> of the seven vialls of wrath are synchronal &amp; relate to one &amp; the same division of the <a id="l108"></a>time of the seventh seal following the silence, into seven successive parts. And at the <a id="l109"></a>sounding of the seventh trumpet the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of God <a id="l110"></a>&amp; Christ &amp; the time of the dead begins that they should be judged. And here ends the inroducto<a id="l111"></a>ty prophesy of the book.</p>
                <p id="par12">In the Interpretation of this prophesy the woman which appears cloathed with the Sun <a id="l112"></a>&amp; hath a crown of twelve starrs upon her head represents the primitive Church catholic <a id="l113"></a>cloathed with the sun of righteousness &amp; crowned with the twelve Apostles, untill she <a id="l114"></a>begins to fly  from the first temple into the wilderness. Hitherto the first <a id="l115"></a>temple is illuminated by the lamps of the seven golden candlesticks, which are the seven <a id="l116"></a>Churches of Asia.</p>

            <p id="par13">The Festivals of the Iews  prescribed <a id="l120"></a>by the Book of the Law were shadows of things to come, &amp; that of the <a id="l121"></a>seventh month is much alluded unto the Apocalyps.</p>
            <p id="par14">On the first day of that month the High Priest dressed the Lamps <a id="l122"></a>in the morning. And this is alluded unto in the first Vision where the Son of <a id="l123"></a>man in the habit of the High Priest appears  in <a id="l124"></a>( or over against) the midst of the seven candlesticks with seven <a id="l125"></a>starrs in his right hand, which are the seven lamps appearing like a <a id="l126"></a>rod of seven starrs as it were in his right hand while he dresses <a id="l127"></a>them. And this dressing is performed by sending seven Epistles to the <a id="l128"></a>Angels of the seven Churches of Asia represented by the seven starrs, &amp; by <a id="l129"></a>those Angels to the seven Churches represented by the seven Candle<a id="l130"></a>sicks. These Epistles contein admonitions against the approaching <a id="l131"></a>Apostacy, &amp; therefore relate to the times when that Apostacy began <a id="l132"></a>to work strongly &amp; before it prevailed. It began to work in the Apostles <a id="l133"></a>days, &amp; was to work till the Man of Sin  should be revealed: but it <a id="l134"></a>was sometime before it began to put the Church in danger. The <a id="l135"></a>visions at the opening of the first four seals relate only to the state <a id="l136"></a>of the heathen Roman Empire &amp; so long the primitive Church continued <a id="l137"></a>in its purity.  Her affairs began to be considered at the opening of the fift seal, &amp; then she began to decline &amp; to to want admonitions, &amp; the Apostacy pre<a id="l138"></a>vailed at the opening of the seventh Seal. Whence the admonitions in these <span class="ns">☉</span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 3v &gt; </span><span class="ns">☉</span> seven Epistles  relate to teh state of the Church in the times of the fift &amp; sixt <a id="l139"></a>seals.

On the east side were three tribes under the <a id="l174"></a>standard of Iudah, on the west were three tribes under the <a id="l175"></a>standard of Ephraim, on the south were three tribes under the standard of of Reuben, &amp; on the north were three tribes under <a id="l176"></a>the standard of  of Dan. Num. 2. And the standard of Iudah was <a id="l177"></a>a Lion, that of Ephraim an Ox, that of Reuben a man, &amp; that of <a id="l178"></a>Dan an Eagle as the Iews affirm. Whence were framed <a id="l179"></a>the hieroglyphicks of Cherubims &amp; Seraphims to represent <a id="l180"></a>the people of Israel. A Cherubim had one body with four <a id="l181"></a>faces, the faces of a Lion, Ox, Man &amp; Eagle looking to the <a id="l182"></a>four winds of heaven without turning about, as in Ezekiels <a id="l183"></a>Vision. And four Seraphims had  the same four faces <a id="l184"></a>with four bodies, one face to every body. The four Beasts <a id="l185"></a>are therefore four Seraphims standing on the four sides <a id="l186"></a>of the peoples court, the first in the eastern side in  the <a id="l187"></a>form  of a Lion, the second in the western side with  the   head <a id="l188"></a>of an Ox, the third in the southern side with  the head  of <a id="l189"></a>a Man &amp; the fourth on the northern side with  the head  of <a id="l190"></a>an Eagle; &amp; all four signify all the twelve tribes of Israel <a id="l191"></a>out of which the hundred forty &amp; four thousand were <a id="l192"></a>sealed. Apoc. 7. 4. <em class="underline">And the four Beasts had each of them six wings</em> <a id="l193"></a> two to a tribe, in all twenty &amp; four wings <a id="l194"></a>answering to the twenty &amp; four stations of the people. <em class="underline">And they  <a id="l195"></a>were full of eyes within</em>, or under their wings. <em class="underline">And they rest not <a id="l196"></a>day &amp; night</em> (or at the morning &amp; evening sacrifices) <em class="underline">saying <a id="l197"></a>Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty which was &amp; is &amp; is to come.</em> These <a id="l198"></a>animals are therefore the Seraphims which appeared to Isaiah in <a id="l199"></a>a Vision like this of the Apocalyps,  chap. 6. For there also <a id="l200"></a>the Lord sat upon a throne in the Temple, &amp; the Seraphims each <a id="l201"></a>with six wings cried Holy, holy, holy Lord of hosts. <em class="underline">And when those <a id="l202"></a>animals give glory &amp; honour &amp; thanks to him that sitteth upon <a id="l203"></a>the throne, who liveth for ever &amp; ever, the four &amp; twenty Elders <sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> <a id="l205"></a>fall down  before him that sat on the throne, &amp; worship <a id="l206"></a>him that liveth for ever &amp; ever, &amp; cast their crowns before the throne <a id="l207"></a>saying Thou art worthy o Lord to receive glory &amp; honour &amp; power: <a id="l208"></a>for thou hast created all things, &amp; for thy pleasure they are &amp; were created.</em> <a id="l209"></a>At the morning &amp; evening sacrifices, so soon as the sacrifice was <a id="l210"></a>laid upon the Altar, &amp; the drink offering began to be poured <a id="l211"></a>out, the trumpets sounded &amp; the Levites sang by course three times, <a id="l212"></a>&amp; every time when the trumpets sounded the people fell down &amp; <a id="l213"></a>worshipped. Three times therefore did the people worship, to express <a id="l214"></a>which number the Beasts cry Holy, holy, holy. And the song being <a id="l215"></a>ended the people prayed standing till the solemnity was ended. And <a id="l216"></a>in the mean time the Priests went into the Temple, &amp; there fell <a id="l217"></a>down before him that sat upon the throne, &amp; worshipped.</p>
            <p id="par16">And Iohn saw <em class="underline">in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne, a <a id="l218"></a>book written within &amp; on the backside</em>, the prophetic book of the Law laid <a id="l219"></a>laid up in the right side of the Ark, which by the festival of the seventh <a id="l220"></a>month predicted these things.  The writing within was seen  at the opening of the seals &amp; that on the backside when all the seals were opened &amp; the book unfolded, &amp; the last leaf turned over. <em class="underline">And the Book was sealed with seven seals,</em> which none was <a id="l224"></a>found worthy to open but the Lamb of God.

And every creature which is in hea<a id="l250"></a>ven &amp; on the earth &amp; under the earth &amp;  such as are <a id="l251"></a>in the sea &amp; all that are in them heard I saying, Blessing &amp; honour <a id="l252"></a>&amp; glory &amp; power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne &amp; unto the <a id="l253"></a>Lamb for ever &amp; ever. And the four Beasts said Amen. And the <a id="l254"></a>four &amp; twenty Elders fell down &amp; worshipped him that liveth for <a id="l255"></a>ever &amp; ever.</em> This was the worship of the primitive Christians.</p>
            <p id="par17">It was the custome for the High Priest seven days before <a id="l256"></a>the Fast of the seventh month to continue  constantly <a id="l257"></a>in the Temple &amp; study the book of the Law that he might be <a id="l258"></a>perfect in it against the day of Expiation, wherein the service <a id="l259"></a>which was various &amp; intricate was wholy to be performed by himself; part <a id="l260"></a>of which service was reading of the Law to the people. And to promote <a id="l261"></a>his studying it, there were certain Priests appointed by the Sanhedrim <a id="l262"></a>to be with him those seven days in one of his chambers in the Temple <a id="l263"></a>&amp; there to discourse with him about the Law &amp; read it to him &amp; put him <a id="l264"></a>in mind of reading &amp; studying it himself. And this his opening &amp; reading <a id="l265"></a>the Law those seven days is alluded unto in the Lambs opening the <a id="l266"></a>seven seals. Conceive that those seven days begin in the evening before each day, for <a id="l267"></a>the Iews began <a id="l268"></a>their day in the <a id="l269"></a>evening, &amp; that <a id="l270"></a>&amp; that the solemnity of the Fast begins in the morning of the <a id="l271"></a>seventh day.</p>

            <p id="par20">The solemnity of the day of Expiation being finished the <a id="l300"></a>seven Angels sound their Trumpets at the great sacrifices of the <a id="l301"></a>seven days of the feast of the Tabernacles, &amp; at the same sacrifices the <a id="l302"></a>seven Thunders utter their voices, which are the Music of the Temple <a id="l303"></a>&amp; singing of the Levites intermixed with the sounding of the Trum<a id="l304"></a>pets, &amp; the seven Angels pour out their Viols of Wrath, which <a id="l305"></a>are the drink-offerings of those sacrifices.</p>
            <p id="par21">When six of the Seals were opened, Iohn said, <em class="underline">And after <a id="l306"></a>these things</em>, (that is, after the visions of the sixt Seal) <em class="underline">I saw four <a id="l307"></a>Angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four <a id="l308"></a>winds of the Earth that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor <a id="l309"></a>on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another Angel ascending <a id="l310"></a>from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a <a id="l311"></a>loud voice to the four Angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth <a id="l312"></a>&amp; the sea, saying</em>  <em class="underline">Hurt not the earth nor the sea <a id="l313"></a>nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God in their <a id="l314"></a>foreheads</em>. This sealing alludes to a tradition of the Iews that upon <a id="l315"></a>the day of Expiation all the people of Israel are sealed  up in the books of life &amp; death. For the Iews in their <a id="l317"></a>Talmud tell us that in the beginning of every new year, or first <sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> <a id="l320"></a>day of the month Tisri (the seventh month of the sacred year) three <a id="l321"></a>books are opened in judgment; the book of life in which the names <a id="l322"></a>of those are written who are perfectly just, the book of death in <a id="l323"></a>which the names of those are written who are Atheists or very <a id="l324"></a>wicked, &amp; a third book of those whose judgment is suspended till <a id="l325"></a>the day of expiation, &amp; whose names are not written in the <a id="l326"></a>book of life or death before that day. The first ten days of this <a id="l327"></a>month they call the penitential days, &amp; all those days they <a id="l328"></a>fast &amp; pray very much, &amp; are very devout, that on the tenth <a id="l329"></a>day their sins may be remitted &amp; their names may be written <a id="l330"></a>in the book of life, which day is therefore called the day of <a id="l331"></a>Expiation. And upon this tenth day in returning home from <a id="l332"></a>their Synagogues they say one to another, <em class="underline">God the creator seal <a id="l333"></a>you to a good year.</em> For they conceive that the books are <a id="l334"></a>now sealed up, &amp; that the sentence of God remains unchanged <a id="l335"></a>henceforward to the end of the year. And the same thing is <a id="l336"></a>signified by the two Goats upon whose foreheads the High <a id="l337"></a>Priest yearly in the days of Expiation lays the two lots inscribed <a id="l338"></a><em class="underline">For God</em> &amp; <em class="underline">For Azazel</em>, Gods lot signifying the people who <a id="l339"></a>are sealed with the name of God in their foreheads, &amp; the lot <a id="l340"></a>Azazel  which was sent into the wilderness, representing <a id="l341"></a>those who receive the mark &amp; name of the Beast &amp; go  into the <a id="l342"></a>wilderness with the great Whore &amp; her Beast.</p>
            <p id="par22">The servants of God being therefore sealed in the day of Expi<a id="l343"></a>ation, conceive that this sealing is synchronal to the visions which ap<a id="l344"></a>pear upon opening the seventh seal, &amp; that the Angels which <a id="l345"></a>hold the four winds were the first four of the seven Angels which <a id="l346"></a> upon opening the seventh seal were seen standing <a id="l347"></a>before God; &amp; that upon their holding the blustering noisy winds there <a id="l348"></a>was silence in heaven for half an hour ; &amp; that while the servants of God <a id="l349"></a>were sealing, the Angel with the golden Censer offered their prayers with <a id="l350"></a>incense upon the golden Altar &amp; read the Law: &amp; that so soon as they were sealed <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> the winds hurt the earth at the sounding of the first Trumpet &amp; the <a id="l351"></a>Sea at sounding of the second, these winds being the wars to which the first <a id="l352"></a>four Trumpets sounded. For as the first four Seals are distinguished from the <a id="l353"></a>three last by the appearance of four horsemen towards the four winds of hea<a id="l354"></a>ven, so the warrs of the first four Trumpets are distinguished from those of the <a id="l355"></a>three last by representing these by four winds &amp; the others by three great <a id="l356"></a>Woes.</p>
            <p id="par23">In one of Ezekiels Visions when the Babylonian captivity <a id="l357"></a>was at hand, six men appeared with slaughter weapons, &amp; a seventh <a id="l358"></a>who appeared among them cloathed in white linnen &amp; had a <a id="l359"></a>writers ink horn by his side, is commanded to go through the midst <a id="l360"></a>of Ierusalem &amp; set a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh <a id="l361"></a>&amp; cry for all the abominations done in the midst thereof; &amp; then <a id="l362"></a>the six men (like the Angels of the first six Trumpets) are com<a id="l363"></a>manded to slay those men who are not marked.  Conceive therefore <a id="l364"></a>that the hundred &amp; forty four thousand are sealed to preserve them <a id="l365"></a>from the plagues of the first six Trumpets; &amp; that at length by the <a id="l366"></a>preaching of the everlasting gospel to all nations they grow into a great multitude, &amp; <a id="l367"></a>at the sounding of the seventh Trumpet come out of the great <a id="l368"></a>tribulation with Palms in their hands: the kingdoms of this world <a id="l369"></a>by the war to which that Trumpet sounds becoming the kingdoms <a id="l370"></a>of God &amp; Christ. For the solemnity of the great Hosannah was <a id="l371"></a>kept by the Iews pon the seventh or last day of the Feast of <a id="l372"></a>Tabernacles: the Iews upon that day carrying Palm-branches <a id="l373"></a>in their hands, &amp; crying Hosannah.</p>
            <p id="par24">After six of the Angels  (answer<a id="l374"></a>ing to  the six men with slaughter weapons) had sounded <a id="l375"></a>their Trumpets, the Lamb in the form of <em class="underline">a mighty Angel, came <a id="l376"></a>down from heaven cloathed with a cload, &amp; a rainbow upon his <a id="l377"></a>head, &amp; his face was as it were the sun &amp; his feet as pillars <a id="l378"></a>of fire</em> [the shape in which Christ appeared in the beginning <a id="l379"></a>of this Prophesy,] <em class="underline">&amp; he had in his hand a little Book open;</em> the <a id="l380"></a>Book which he had newly opened.

And <a id="l404"></a>therefore the prophesy of the seven thunders is nothing else then <a id="l405"></a>a repetition of the prophesy of the seven Trumpets in another <a id="l406"></a>form. <em class="underline">And the Angel which I saw stand upon the sea &amp; upon the <a id="l407"></a>earth, lifted up his hand to heaven &amp; swore by him that liveth <a id="l408"></a>for ever &amp; ever that</em> [after the seven thunders]  <em class="underline">there should be time no longer, but in the days of the voice <a id="l410"></a>of the seventh Angel when he should begin to sound, the mystery of <a id="l411"></a>God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the Prophets.</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> The voices of the Thunders therefore last to the end of this world <a id="l412"></a>&amp; so do those of the  Trumpets.</p>

And the <a id="l553"></a>prophesy being finished Iohn is inspired anew by the eaten book &amp; begins <a id="l554"></a>the Interpretation of the  prophesy with these words: And the Temple <a id="l555"></a>of God &amp;c.</p>

                    <p id="par33">The servants of God being therefore sealed in the days of expiation <a id="l556"></a>conceive that this sealing is synchronal to the visions which appear upon <a id="l557"></a>opening the seventh seal, &amp; that when the Lamb had opened six of the seals <a id="l558"></a> &amp; seen the visions relating to the inside of the sixt leaf he looked on the <a id="l559"></a>backside of the seventh leaf &amp;  then saw the four <a id="l560"></a>angels holding the four winds of heaven, &amp; another Angel ascending <a id="l561"></a>from the cast with the seal of God. Conceive also that the Angels which <a id="l562"></a>hold the four winds were the first four of the seven Angels. <a id="l563"></a>VI. 37/ VI. 55/ VII. 15</p>

            <h2 id="hd3" class="cent">Sect. X <a id="l564"></a><br>Of the relation which the Prophesy <a id="l565"></a>of Iohn hath to those of Daniel <a id="l566"></a>and of the Subject of the <a id="l567"></a>Prophesy.</h2> 
            <p id="par34">The whole scene of Sacred Prophesy is composed of three <a id="l568"></a>principal parts; the regions beyond Euphrates represented by the <a id="l569"></a>two first Beasts of Daniel; the Empire of the Greeks on this <a id="l570"></a>side of Euphrates represented by the Leopard &amp; by the He Goat, &amp; <a id="l571"></a>the Empire of the Latines on this side Greece represented by the <a id="l572"></a>Beast with ten horns. And to these three parts the phrases of the <a id="l573"></a>thir part of the Earth, Sea, rivers, trees, ships, stars, sun &amp; Moon <a id="l574"></a>relate. I place the body of the fourth Beast on this side Greece <a id="l575"></a>because the three first  of the four Beasts had their lives prolonged after <a id="l576"></a>their dominion was taken away &amp; therefore belong not to the body <a id="l577"></a>of the fourth. He only stamped them with he feet.</p>
            <p id="par35">By the <em class="underline">Earth</em> the Iews understood the great continent of <a id="l578"></a>Asia &amp; Afric to which they had access by land; &amp; by the Isles <a id="l579"></a>of the <em class="underline">Sea</em> they under the places to which they sailed by sea <a id="l580"></a>&amp; particularly all Europe. And hence in this Prophesy the <em class="underline">Earth</em> <a id="l581"></a>&amp; <em class="underline">Sea</em> are put for the nations of the Greek &amp; Latin Empires</p>
            <p id="par36">The third &amp; fourth Beast of Daniel are the same with <a id="l582"></a>with the Dragon &amp; ten horned Beast of Iohn, but with this <a id="l583"></a>difference. Iohn puts the Dragon for the whole Roman <a id="l584"></a>Empire while it continued entire because it was entire <a id="l585"></a>when that Prophesy was given; &amp; the Beast he considers not till <a id="l586"></a>the Empire became divided; &amp; then he puts the Dragon for <a id="l587"></a>the Empire of the Greeks &amp; the Beast for the Empire of the <a id="l588"></a>Latines. And hence it is that the Dragon  &amp; Beast have common heads &amp; common horns <a id="l590"></a>But the Dragon hath crowns only upon his heads &amp; the Beast <a id="l591"></a>only upon his horns, because the Beasts Horns &amp; his reigned not before <a id="l592"></a>they were divided from the Dragon, &amp; when the Dragon gave <a id="l593"></a>the Beast his throne, the ten horns received power as kings <a id="l594"></a>the same hour with the Beast. The heads are seven successive <a id="l595"></a> kings. Four of them were the four horsmen which appeared at <a id="l596"></a>the opening of the first four Seals. In the latter end of the <a id="l597"></a>sixt head or seale considered as present in the visions, it is <a id="l598"></a>said, <em class="underline">Five</em> of the seven kings <em class="underline">are fallen, &amp; one is &amp; another <a id="l599"></a> is not come, &amp; the Beast that was &amp; is not</em> (being wounded <a id="l600"></a>to death with a sword) <em class="underline">he is the eighth &amp; of the seven.</em> He <a id="l601"></a>was therefore a collateral part of the seventh. The horns <a id="l602"></a>are the same with those of Daniels fourth Beast described <a id="l603"></a>above.</p>
            <p id="par37">The four horsmen which appear at the opening of the first four <a id="l604"></a>seales have been well explained by M<sup>r</sup> Mead, excepting that <a id="l605"></a>I had rather continue the third to the end of the reign of the <a id="l606"></a>the three Gordians &amp; Philip the Arabian, those being kings from the <a id="l607"></a>south, &amp; begin the fourth with the reign of Decius &amp; continue it till <a id="l608"></a>the reign of Dioclesian. For the fourth horsman <em class="underline">sat upon <a id="l609"></a>a pale</em> horse, <em class="underline">&amp; his name was Death &amp; Hell followed with him <a id="l610"></a>&amp; power was given them  to kill unto the fourth part of <a id="l611"></a>the earth, with the sword &amp; with  famine &amp; with the plague <a id="l612"></a>&amp; with the Beasts of the earth</em> or armies of invaders &amp; rebells: &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span> such were the times during all this intervall. Hitherto the Roman <a id="l613"></a>Empire continued in an undivided Monarchical form exept rebelli<a id="l614"></a>ons; &amp; such it is represented by the four horsmen. But Dioclsi<a id="l615"></a>an divided it between himself &amp; Maximianus, A. C. 285. &amp; it continued it <a id="l616"></a>in that  divided state till the victory of Constantine the <a id="l617"></a>great over Licinius A. C. 323. which put an end to the heathen perse<a id="l618"></a>cutions set on foot by  Dioclesian &amp; Maxi<a id="l619"></a>mianus &amp; described at the opening of the fift seal. But this <a id="l620"></a>division of the Empire was imperfect: the whole being still <a id="l621"></a>under one &amp; the same Senate. The same victory of Con<a id="l622"></a>stantine over Licinius  (a heathen persecutor,) began the <a id="l623"></a>fall of the heathen Empire described at the opening of the Sixt <a id="l624"></a>seal. And the Visions of this Seal continue till after the reign <a id="l625"></a>of Iulian the Apostate, he being a heathen Emperor &amp; reign<a id="l626"></a>ing over the whole  Roman Empire.</p>
            <p id="par38">The affairs of the Church being to be considered at <a id="l627"></a>the opening of the fift Seal as was said above. And then <a id="l628"></a>she is represented by a Woman in the Temple of heaven <a id="l629"></a>clothed with the Sun of righteousness &amp; the Moon of Iewish <a id="l630"></a>ceremonies under her feet, upon her head &amp; a crown of twelve starrs  <a id="l631"></a>relating to the twelve tribes of Israel, &amp; to the  twelve Apostles. . When she fled from the Temple into the <a id="l632"></a>wilderness she left in the Temple a remnant of her seed who kept the <a id="l633"></a>commandments of God &amp; had the testimony of Iesus, &amp; there<a id="l634"></a>fore before her flight she represented the true primitive Church of God  tho afterwards she degenerated like Ahe<a id="l636"></a>lah &amp; Aholibah. In Dioclesians persecution she cried <a id="l637"></a>travelling in birth &amp; pained to be delivered. And in the end <a id="l638"></a>of that persecution (by the victory of Constantine  over Maxentius A. C. 312) she brought forth a manchild, such a <a id="l639"></a>child as was to rule all nations with a rod of iron, a Chris<a id="l640"></a>tian Empire. And her child (by the victory of Constan<a id="l641"></a>tine the great  over Lacinus A. C. 323) was caught up to <a id="l642"></a>God &amp; his throne. And the Woman (by the division of <a id="l643"></a>the Roman Empire into the Greek &amp; Latine Empires) <a id="l644"></a>fled from the  Temple into the wilderness of the Latine Empire <a id="l645"></a>where she is found afterwards sitting upon the Beast &amp; upon <a id="l646"></a>seven mountains &amp; is called the great city which reigneth <a id="l647"></a>over the kings of the earth, that is over the ten kings which give <a id="l648"></a>their kingdom to her Beast.</p>
            <p id="par39">But before her flight there was war in heaven between <a id="l649"></a>Michael &amp; the Dragon (the Christian &amp; the heathen religions,) <a id="l650"></a>&amp; the Dragon <em class="underline">that old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan <a id="l651"></a>who deceiveth the whole world</em> (the heathen religion) <em class="underline">was <a id="l652"></a>cast out to the earth, &amp; his Angels were cast out with <a id="l653"></a>him</em>. And Iohn <em class="underline">heard a voice in heaven saying, Now is <a id="l654"></a>come salvation &amp; strength &amp; the kingdom of our God, &amp; the <a id="l655"></a>power of his Christ. For the accuser of our brethren is <a id="l656"></a>cast down. And they overcame him by the blood of the <a id="l657"></a>Lamb &amp; by the word of their testimony. And they loved not <a id="l658"></a>their lives unto the death. Therefore rejoyce ye heavens &amp; ye <a id="l659"></a>that dwell in them.

            <p id="par40"><em class="underline">And when the Dragon saw that he was cast down</em>from <a id="l663"></a>the Roman throne, &amp; the Man-child caught up thither, <em class="underline">he persecuted the Woman which brought <a id="l664"></a>forth the Man-child, &amp; to her</em> (by the division of the Roman <a id="l665"></a>Empire between the  <a id="l666"></a>cities of Rome &amp; Constantinople A.

C. 353) &amp; thus <a id="l673"></a>the Beast was <a id="l674"></a>wounded to death <a id="l675"></a>with a sword. <a id="l676"></a><em class="underline">And the</em>  <em class="underline">Dragon was wroth with <a id="l677"></a>the Woman</em>  (in the reign of Iulian the <a id="l678"></a>Apostate A.

And thus the  the Beast revived And by the next division of <a id="l682"></a>the Empire which was between Gratian &amp; Theodosius, A. C. 369, <em class="underline">the <a id="l683"></a>Beast</em> with ten horns <em class="underline">rose out of the sea</em>, &amp; <em class="underline">the Beast</em> <a id="l684"></a>with two horns <em class="underline">out of the Earth</em>, and by the last division <a id="l685"></a>thereof which was between the sons of Theodosius, A. C. 395, <em class="underline">the Dra<a id="l686"></a>gon gave the Beast his  power &amp; throne &amp; great <a id="l687"></a>authority.</em> And the ten horns <em class="underline">received power as kings <a id="l688"></a>the same hour with the Beast</em>, or within twice the time <a id="l689"></a>that there was silence in heaven.</p>
            <p id="par41">At length the Woman arrived at her place place of temporal as well as spiritual dominion upon the back <a id="l690"></a>of the Beast where she is nourished for a time times &amp; <a id="l691"></a>half a time form the face of the Serpent; not in his king<a id="l692"></a>dome but at a distance from him. She is nourished by the <a id="l693"></a>Merchants of the earth three times or years &amp; an half, <a id="l694"></a>or 42 months, or 1260 days; &amp; in this prophesy days are <a id="l695"></a>put for years. During all this time the Beast  acted <a id="l696"></a>&amp; she sat upon him, that is reigned over him, &amp; over the <a id="l697"></a>ten kings who gave their kingdom to him, &amp; she was drunk<a id="l698"></a>en with the blood of the saints. And by all these circum<a id="l699"></a>stances she is the eleventh horn of Daniel's fourth Beast, <a id="l700"></a>who reigned with a look more stout then the other ten, <a id="l701"></a>&amp; was of a different kind from the rest, &amp; had eyes &amp; <a id="l702"></a>a mouth like the Woman, &amp; made war with the saints <a id="l703"></a>&amp; prevailed against them &amp; wore them out, &amp;  changed <a id="l704"></a>times &amp; laws, &amp; had them given into his hands untill a <a id="l705"></a>time times &amp; half a time. The characters of the Woman <a id="l706"></a>&amp; little horn of the Beast agree perfectly. In respect of her  temporal dominion <a id="l708"></a>she was a horn of the Beast, in respect of her spi<a id="l709"></a>ritual dominion she rode upon him in the form of a woman &amp; was his Church <a id="l710"></a>&amp; committed fornication with the ten kings.</p>
            <p id="par42">And the second Beast which rose up out of the earth <a id="l711"></a>was the Church of the Greek Empire. For it had two horns <a id="l712"></a>like those of the Lamb &amp; therefore was a Church, <a id="l713"></a>&amp; it spoke as the Dragon &amp; therefore was of his reli<a id="l714"></a>gion, &amp; it rose up out of the earth &amp; by consequence <a id="l715"></a>in his kingdom. It is called also the fals Prophet that <a id="l716"></a>wrought miracles before the first Beast (not within in <a id="l717"></a>but before him) by which he deceived them that received <a id="l718"></a>the mark of the Beast &amp; worshipped his Image. When <a id="l719"></a>the Dragon went from the Woman to make war with the <a id="l720"></a>remnant of her seed, this Beast arising out of the earth <a id="l721"></a>assisted him in that war, &amp; caused the earth &amp; them that <a id="l722"></a>dwell therein to worship the authority of the first Beast whose mortal wound <a id="l723"></a>was heald, <a id="l724"></a>&amp; to make an Image to him, that is to assemble a body of men <a id="l725"></a>like him in point of religion. And he had power to give <a id="l726"></a>life &amp; authority to the Image, so that it could both speak <a id="l727"></a>&amp; by dictating cause that  all religions bodies of men <a id="l728"></a>who would not worship the authority of the Image should <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> be mystically killed.

            <p id="par43">And while the Gentiles tread the Holy city under foot <a id="l765"></a>God gives power to his two Witnesses &amp; they prophesy in <a id="l766"></a>sackcloth all the 1260 days.

Five of those Churches were found <a id="l776"></a>fualty, &amp; threatned if they did not repent; the other two <a id="l777"></a>were without fault, &amp; so their Candlesticks were fit to be <a id="l778"></a>placed in the second Temple.

But here in this Prophesy they are put figura<a id="l849"></a>tively for the disciples of  refined Tatian &amp; Monitanus, who the philosophy of the Gnostics, &amp; coloured <a id="l850"></a>over their spiritall fornication with a pretence of Christianity, <a id="l851"></a>&amp; under that pretence crept silently into the Churches.</p>
            <p id="par45">The persecution of Dioclesian began in the year of Christ <a id="l852"></a>302, &amp; lasted ten years in the eastern empire &amp; two years in <a id="l853"></a>the western. And to this state of the Church the second Epistle, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span> that to the Church of Smyrna, agrees. <em class="underline">I know,</em> saith Christ, <a id="l854"></a><em class="underline">thy works &amp; tribulation &amp; poverty</em> (but thou art rich,) <em class="underline">&amp; I <a id="l855"></a>know the blasphemy of them</em> (the Nicolaitans) <em class="underline">who say they <a id="l856"></a>are Iews &amp; are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan.

Be thou faithfull unto <a id="l860"></a>death &amp; I will give thee a crown of life.</em> The tribulation <a id="l861"></a>of ten days can agree to no other persecution then that of <a id="l862"></a>Dioclesian, it being the only persecution which lasted ten <a id="l863"></a>years. By the blasphemy of them that say they are Iews <a id="l864"></a>&amp; are not, but are  the synagogue of Satan, I under<a id="l865"></a>stand the idolatry of the Nicolaitans who falsly said they <a id="l866"></a>were Christians.</p>
            <p id="par46">These Nicolaitans are complained of also in the third <a id="l867"></a>Epistle as men that <em class="underline">held the doctrine of Balaam who taught <a id="l868"></a>Balac [the king] to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel <a id="l869"></a>to eat things sacrificed to Idols &amp; to commit</em> spiritual <em class="underline">for<a id="l870"></a>nication.</em> For Balaam taught the Moabites &amp;  <sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> <a id="l872"></a>Midianites to tempt &amp; invite Israel by their weomen to commit fornication  &amp; to feast with them at the sacrifices of their Gods.</p>
            <p id="par47">They are also complained of in the fourth Epistle <a id="l874"></a>under the name of the woman <em class="underline">Iezabel which calleth <a id="l875"></a>herself a Prophetess &amp; teacheth &amp; seduceth</em> the <em class="underline">servants</em> <a id="l876"></a>of Christ <em class="underline">to commit fornication &amp; to eat things sacrificed <a id="l877"></a>to Idols.</em> This Woman began now to fly into the <a id="l878"></a>wilderness, &amp; in the second &amp; sixt Epistles she is called <a id="l879"></a>the Synagogue of Satan.</p>
            
            <p id="par49">The reign of Constantine the great from the time <a id="l882"></a>of his conquering Licinius, was monarchical over the <a id="l883"></a>whole Roman Empire; Then the Empire became <a id="l884"></a>divided between the sons of Constantine reigning at <a id="l885"></a>Rome &amp; Constantinople; &amp; then it was united under <a id="l886"></a>Constantius by his victory over Magnentius. And to the <a id="l887"></a>affairs of the Church in these three successive periods <a id="l888"></a>of time, the third fourth &amp; fift epistles, that is, those <a id="l889"></a>to the Angels of the Churches in Pergamus, Thyatira <a id="l890"></a>&amp; Sardis, seem to relate. And the next Emperor was Iulian <a id="l891"></a>a heathen.</p>
            <p id="par50">In the sixt Epistle, that to the Angel of the Church <a id="l892"></a>of Philadelphia, Christ saith: <em class="underline">Because thou hast kept <a id="l893"></a>the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from <a id="l894"></a>the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the <a id="l895"></a>world to try them that dwell upon the earth</em>. — <em class="underline">Him <a id="l896"></a>that overcometh will I make a pillar in the Temple <a id="l897"></a>of my God, &amp; he shall go no more out, &amp; I will write <a id="l898"></a>upon him the name of my God,</em> &amp;c. that is, Because <a id="l899"></a>in the reign of the Emperor Iulian the Apostate <a id="l900"></a>thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep <a id="l901"></a>thee from the hour of temptation, which by the Woman's <a id="l902"></a>flying into the Wilderness, &amp; the Dragon's making war <a id="l903"></a>with the remnant of her seed, &amp; the killing of all that <a id="l904"></a>will not worship the Image of the Beast, shall come <a id="l905"></a>upon all the world to try them that dwell on the earth, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017r"> &lt;17r&gt; </span> &amp; to distinguish them by sealing the one with the name <a id="l906"></a>of God in their foreheads, &amp; marking the other with the <a id="l907"></a>mark of the Beast. And <em class="underline">him that overcometh I will <a id="l908"></a>make a pillar in the temple of my God &amp; he shall go no <a id="l909"></a>more out of it. And I will write upon him the name of <a id="l910"></a>my God in his forehead.</em> So then the Christians of the <a id="l911"></a>Church of Philadelphia, as many of them as overcome, <a id="l912"></a>are sealed with the seal of God &amp; placed in the second <a id="l913"></a>Temple, &amp; go no more out. And the same is to be <a id="l914"></a>understood of the Church in Smyrna. These two Churches with their posterity are there<a id="l915"></a>fore the two pillars &amp; two Candlesticks &amp; the two <a id="l916"></a>witnesses in the second Temple.</p>
            <p id="par51">After the reign of Iulian &amp; his successor Iovian <a id="l917"></a>who reigned but five months, the Empire became divi<a id="l918"></a>ded again between Valentinian &amp; Valens. And then the <a id="l919"></a>Church catholic, in the Epistle to the Angel of the Church of <a id="l920"></a>Laodicea is reprehended as <em class="underline">luke-warm</em>, &amp; threat<a id="l921"></a>ned to be <em class="underline">spewed out of Christs mouth.</em> She said that <a id="l922"></a>she was <em class="underline">rich &amp; increased in goods &amp; had need of nothing</em> <a id="l923"></a>(being in outward prosperity;) <em class="underline">&amp; knew not that she <a id="l924"></a>was</em> (inwardly) <em class="underline">wretched &amp; miserable &amp; poor &amp; blind &amp; <a id="l925"></a>naked.</em> She is therefore spewed out of Christs mouth. <a id="l926"></a>at the opening of the seventh seal. And this puts an end to the times of the first Temple.</p>
            <p id="par52">M<sup>r</sup> Mead hath explained the Prophesy of the first six <a id="l927"></a>Trumpets not much amiss. If he had observed that the <a id="l928"></a>prophesy of pouring out the Vials of wrath is synchro<a id="l929"></a>nal to that of sounding the Trumpets, his explanation <a id="l930"></a>would have been more complete.</p>
            <p id="par53">The sacrifices on the first four days of the feast of <a id="l931"></a>Tabernacles at which the first four Trumpets sound <a id="l932"></a>&amp; the first four Vials of wrath are poured out, are <a id="l933"></a>slaughters in four great warrs &amp; these warrs are represented by four winds to the four corners of the <a id="l934"></a>earth. The first was an east wind, the second a west <a id="l935"></a>wind, the third a south wind &amp; the fourth a north <a id="l936"></a>wind with respect to the city of Rome the old metro<a id="l937"></a>polis of the  Roman Empire.  These four plagues fall upon the third part of the earth, sea, rivers, sun moon &amp; starrs, that is upon the earth sea rivers sun moon &amp; starrs of the third part of the whole scene of these prophesies of Daniel &amp; Iohn. The Romans were much infested by the invasions of <a id="l939"></a>barbarous nations in the end of the reign of the Emperor <a id="l940"></a>Valans. But those warrs were fully stopt  in the beginning of the reign of <a id="l942"></a>Theodosius A. C. 379 &amp; 380. And thence forward the Em<a id="l943"></a>pire remained quiet from forreign armies till the death <a id="l944"></a>of Theodosius, A. C. 395.  So long the four winds were held, &amp; at the death of that Emperor <a id="l945"></a>they began to blow.</p>
            <p id="par54">The plague of the eastern wind at the sounding of <a id="l946"></a>the first Trumpet was to fall upon the <em class="underline">earth</em>, that is, upon <a id="l947"></a>the nations of the Greek empire. And accordingly, after <a id="l948"></a>the death of Theodosius the Goths, Sarmatans, Hunns, Isau<a id="l949"></a>rians &amp; Astonians invaded &amp; miserably wasted Greece, <a id="l950"></a>Thrace, Asia minor, Armenia, Syria, Egypt Libya &amp; <a id="l951"></a>Illyricum for ten or twelve years together.</p>
            <p id="par55">That of the western wind at the sounding of the <a id="l952"></a>second Trumpet, was to fall upon the <em class="underline">sea</em> or western <a id="l953"></a>Empire, by means of a burning mountain cast into it &amp; <a id="l954"></a>turning it to blood. And accordingly in the year 407, that <a id="l955"></a>Empire  began to be invaded  by the Visigoths, Vandals, Ailans, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span> Sueves,  Burgundians, Ostrogoths, Heruli, Quades, Gepides, <a id="l956"></a>&amp; by these warrs was broken into ten kingdoms &amp; miserably <a id="l957"></a>wasted, &amp; Rome (the burning mountain was beseiged &amp; taken by the Ostrogoths in the beginning of these <a id="l958"></a>miseries.</p>
            <p id="par56">That of the southern wind was to be  executed at the <a id="l959"></a>sounding of the third Trumpet by a great star burning as <a id="l960"></a>it were a lamp &amp; falling from heaven upon the <em class="underline">rivers &amp; fountains of <a id="l961"></a>waters</em> [the western Empire now divided into many kingdoms] <a id="l962"></a>&amp; to turn them into wormwood &amp; blood &amp; make them bitter. And accord<a id="l963"></a>ingly the king of the Vandals in Spain in the year 427 <a id="l964"></a>fell from his dominion in Spain  &amp; with his <a id="l965"></a>people the Vandals &amp; Alans invaded Afric &amp; by a <a id="l966"></a>vexatious war took it from the Romans; &amp; infested also <a id="l967"></a>the Sea-coasts of Europe by a pyratical war, &amp; took Sicily, Sardinia, Cosica, Eabusus, Majorca Minorca  &amp; wasted Italy &amp; sackt Rome.</p>
            <p id="par57">That of the northern wind at the sounding of the <a id="l969"></a>fourth Trumpet, was to cause <em class="underline">the Sun Moon &amp; Starrs</em> <a id="l970"></a>(that is the western Empiror &amp; his great men) to be <a id="l971"></a>darkened, &amp; to continue sometime in darkness. And accord<a id="l972"></a>ingly Odoacer king of the Heruli invaded Italy A. C. <a id="l973"></a>476, &amp; seized the dominions of Augustulus the last of <a id="l974"></a>the western Emperors. This plague was continued by <a id="l975"></a>the wars which the Ostrogoths made upon the Heruli <a id="l976"></a>&amp; which Bellisarius afterwards made upon the Ostrogoths <a id="l977"></a>&amp; the Lombards soon after upon the Romans by invad<a id="l978"></a>ing Italy &amp; chiefly Lombardy. And by all these warrs <a id="l979"></a>Italy was miserably wasted &amp; almost depopulated &amp; Rome thrice taken.</p>
            
            <p id="par59">The fift Trumpet sounded to the warrs which <a id="l984"></a>the king of the south (as he is called by Daniel) <a id="l985"></a>made in the time of the end, in pushing at the king <a id="l986"></a>who had done according to his will. This plauge <a id="l987"></a>began with the opening of the bottomless pit, which <a id="l988"></a>denotes the letting out of a fals religion, the smoke <a id="l989"></a>which came out of the pit signifying the multitude <a id="l990"></a>which embraced that religion, &amp; the Locusts which <a id="l991"></a>came out of the smoke the armies which came out of <a id="l992"></a>that multitude. And this pit was opened to let out smoke &amp; locusts into the  regions of the four monarchies. And their king was the Angel of <a id="l993"></a>the bottomless pit, or chief governour as well in <a id="l994"></a>religious as civil affairs. Swarms of Locusts arise in <a id="l995"></a>Arabia fœlix &amp; in scripture armies of Arabians are <a id="l996"></a>compared to  grasshoppers. Iudg. 8. 5 &amp; 7. 12.

But these Locusts reigned first at <a id="l998"></a>Damascus &amp; then at Bagdat,  &amp; were to continue five months &amp; <a id="l999"></a>five months that is ten months or 300 years  at both places.

The Dragon  signifies the same dominion with the He Goat in the reign of his last <a id="l1056"></a>horn that is the whole Roman Empire untill the Empire becomes divided; &amp; after the division the <a id="l1057"></a>Dragon signifies the Eastern part thereof  descended from Iavan, &amp; the Beast the wetsern part thereof repre<a id="l1058"></a>sented by  Daniels fourth Beast. in the reign of his ten horns The Woman riding upon the Beast is represented in Daniel <a id="l1059"></a>by the  last horn of the Beast which had eyes &amp; a mouth &amp; whose look was more stout <a id="l1060"></a>then his fellows.  and before her flight into the wilderness she is represented in Daniel by the host <a id="l1061"></a>of heaven. #<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 21v &gt; </span># When the Woman fled from Mout Sion into the wilderness she left  a remnant of her seed  <a id="l1062"></a>who kept the commandments of God &amp; had the testimony of Iesus; And out of whom (in <a id="l1063"></a>the war which the Dragon made upon them) were sealed the 144000 whom Iohn saw <a id="l1064"></a>remaining on mount Sion, &amp; in whose mouth was found no lye.  These witnesses are  <a id="l1065"></a>in Daniel called the saints of the most High whom the little horn of his fourth Beast shall weare <a id="l1066"></a>out during a time times &amp; half a time  &amp; to whom the kingdom <a id="l1067"></a>&amp; dominion &amp; greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall  afterwards be given<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 21r resumes &gt; </span> </p>
            <p id="par65"> The scene of the visions is the Temple. There God is represented  sitting upon a throne <a id="l1076"></a> above the Ark between the Cherubims, &amp; the Princes of the 24 courses of the Priests  <a id="l1077"></a> in their chambers in the Priests court are represented by 24 Elders crowned sitting on thrones, <a id="l1078"></a>&amp; the people in the four sides of the peoples court by the four Beasts which were the standards <a id="l1079"></a>of the four squadrons of the people of Israel encamped on the four sides of the Tabernacle in <a id="l1080"></a>the wilderness. And the book of the law, whose ceremonies &amp; festivals were prophetic, &amp; which <a id="l1081"></a>was laid up in the right side of the Ark, was reprented in the right hand of him that sat upon the <a id="l1082"></a>throne.  And the morning sacrifice was represented by a Lamb as it were slain at the foot <a id="l1083"></a>of the altar.  Daniel was commanded to seale up the book of prophesy, &amp; the Lamb of <a id="l1085"></a>God takes this book out of the hand of him that sits upon the throne &amp; opens the <a id="l1086"></a>seven seales thereof successively &amp; by doing so distinguishes the times to come into <a id="l1087"></a>seven successive parts. And the visions which appear upon opening the seales denote <a id="l1088"></a>the things to be done in  the time of every seale.  The visions at opening the <a id="l1089"></a>first four relate only  to the temporal affairs of the Roman Empire, &amp; the fift <a id="l1090"></a>begins with the affairs of the Church. For the Churches founded by the preaching of <a id="l1091"></a>the Apostles lasted in their fervency during the opening of the first four seales <a id="l1092"></a>&amp; needed no new admonitions  before the opening of the fift.</p>
            <p id="par66">The morning service of the Iews began with dressing of the Lamps. And in the <a id="l1093"></a>festival of the seventh month the High Priest dressed them. And in allusion thereunto <a id="l1094"></a>Iohn saw one like unto the son of man in the High Priests habit,  in the midst <a id="l1095"></a> (or  over against the midst) of the seven golden Candlesticks. And he <a id="l1096"></a>had in his right hand a rod of seven starrs, the seven lamps appearing in a right line <a id="l1097"></a>like a rod of seven starrs in his right hand while he dressed them. And the seven <a id="l1098"></a>Candlesticks  are said to  be the seven Churches of Asia which <a id="l1099"></a>were under the  care of Iohn the Apostle, &amp; the seven starrs the Angels of those <a id="l1100"></a>Churches, that is the Bishops; &amp; he dressed them by seven admonitory epistles <a id="l1101"></a>sent to those Angels against the approaching apostacy. And these admonitions relate to <a id="l1102"></a>the times of the fift &amp; sixt seales.</p>
            <p id="par67">At the opening of the fift seal followed a signal persecution which was that <a id="l1103"></a>of Dioclesian: &amp; at the opening of the sixt followed the end of a world polytic which <a id="l1104"></a>was that of the heathen Roman Empire.  This Empire fell in the reign of Constantine the <a id="l1105"></a>great &amp; his sons, was revived by Iulian the Apostate  fell again in the <a id="l1106"></a>reign of Valentinian &amp; Valens &amp; revived no more. The time which follows the <a id="l1107"></a>opening of the seventh seal is divided into seven successive parts by the sounding of <a id="l1108"></a>seven Trumpets successively. And the same division is represented also by the seven <a id="l1109"></a>thunders &amp; by the  pouring out of seven Vials of wrath. This is done with <a id="l1110"></a>allusion to the great sacrifices on the seven days of the feast of Tabernacles, the seven Trumpets <a id="l1111"></a>alluding to the sounding of  Trumpets by the Priests at the  sacrifices  of those <a id="l1112"></a>seven days, the seven thunders to the singing of the Priests at the same sacrifices &amp; the <a id="l1113"></a>seven Vialls of wrath to the drink offerings poured out at the same sacrifices on <a id="l1114"></a>those seven days. And as all Daniels Prophesies consist of two parts;  an intro<a id="l1115"></a>ductory Prophesy &amp; an Interpretation: so doth Iohns. The Prophesy  ends with the  <a id="l1116"></a>sounding of the seventh Trumpet, &amp; the Interpretation <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021v-a"> &lt;21v-a&gt; </span> begins with the words: <em class="underline">And the Temple of God was opened in heaven, &amp; there was seen <a id="l1117"></a>in his Temple the arc of his testament.</em></p>

<div>
            <p id="par68">In the primitive times of Christianity these seven Candlesticks by their Lamps illuminated the <a id="l1118"></a>temple, that is the Church catholick.  And in dressing these lamps five of them are found faulty &amp;  <a id="l1119"></a>admished to repent &amp; threatned to be removed out of their places or spewed out of Christs mouth <a id="l1120"></a>&amp; punished with death &amp; with the sword of his mouth if they repented not: but two of them which were in affliction (viz <a id="l1121"></a>(the Churches of Smyrna &amp; Philadelphia) were without fault &amp; those remained on Mount Sion to illuminate the second <a id="l1122"></a>Temple &amp; are called the two Witnesses. &amp;  There are the 144000 on Mount Sion who had the testimony of <a id="l1123"></a>Iesus &amp; in whose mouth was found no lye. And their adversaries who prophesy against them &amp; speak <a id="l1124"></a>as the Dragon being his Church, are called the fals Prophet &amp; the Prophet Balaam who  taught <a id="l1125"></a> Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, &amp;   <a id="l1126"></a>&amp;   to eat things sacrificed to idols,  &amp; to worship <a id="l1128"></a><em class="underline">the Beast</em> &amp; his Image</p>
</div>



<div>
            <p id="par69" class="i0">And lotts were cast upon them, &amp; Gods lot was sacrificed. There was also a bullock offered for the sins <a id="l1129"></a>of the people. And  the H. Priest cloathed in linnen garments took a censer of burning coals <a id="l1130"></a>of fire from the golden Altar &amp; his hands full of sweet incense – – – continued in silence <a id="l1131"></a>at their devotion. Then the High priest went into the Holy place &amp; put off his linnen garments <a id="l1132"></a>– – – – – earth to burn them. And as the people went home from the temple they said <a id="l1133"></a>to one another God seale you to a good new year. And in allusion to all this at the opening <a id="l1134"></a>of the seventh seale there is silence in heaven for half an hour, &amp;  incense is offered <a id="l1135"></a>with the prayers of the saints upon the golden altar. And the Angel fills a censer with fire of the <a id="l1136"></a>altar &amp; casts it to the earth. And 144000 are sealed out of all the twelve tribes of Israel <a id="l1137"></a>for Gods lot &amp; the woman flyes into the wilderness with those that receive the mark of the <a id="l1138"></a>Beast &amp; gets upon his back. And hence the seating of the 144000 is synchonal to the silence <a id="l1139"></a>in heaven for half an hour &amp; to the incense offered with the prayers of the saints.</p></div>

            <p id="par72">On the tenth day of the month two Goats were brought into the temple to represent the people  <a id="l1156"></a>one the elect &amp; the other the reprobate &amp; lots were cast upon them, &amp; Gods lot was sacrificed to him, <a id="l1157"></a>&amp; the other Goat  called Azazel or the scape-Goat was sent into the wilderness loaded with the sins of the people <a id="l1158"></a>And in allusion to this — seven churches of Asia</p>
            
            
            
            <p id="par76">When the Goat for the Lord was slain, together with a bullock, for a sin offering, the High <a id="l1159"></a>Priest took a censer full of burning coals of fire from the altar &amp; his hands full of sweet incense beaten <a id="l1160"></a>small &amp; went into the most holy place within the vail &amp; sprinkled the blood of bullock with his finger <a id="l1161"></a>upon the mercy seat eastward seven times &amp; then killed the goat of the sin offering &amp; brought his <a id="l1162"></a>blood  within the vail &amp; sprinkled it also upon the mercy seat &amp; before the mercy seat. And <a id="l1163"></a>then he went out to the Altar &amp; sprinkled it seven times with the blood of the bullock &amp; as often with that <a id="l1164"></a>of the goat. And after this he laid both his hands upon the head of the scape Goat &amp; confessed over <a id="l1165"></a>him all the iniquities of the children of Israel &amp; all their transgressions in all their sins putting <a id="l1166"></a>them upon the head of the Goat &amp; sent him into the wilderness. And while the high priest was doing <a id="l1167"></a>these things in the most holy place &amp; at the  Altar, the people continued in silence at their <a id="l1168"></a>private devotion. And to this alludes the silence in heaven for half an hour which followed <a id="l1169"></a>upon opening the seventh seale. Then the High priest went into the holy place &amp; put off <a id="l1170"></a>his linnen  garments &amp; put on other cloaths &amp; came out &amp; sent the bullock &amp; <a id="l1171"></a>the Goat of the sin offering to be burnt without the camp.

And as the people departed from the temple <a id="l1176"></a>they said  to one another: God seale you to a good year.

            <p id="par77">In the interpretation of this prophesy the woman before she flyes into the <a id="l1179"></a>wilderness, represents the primitive church catholic illuminated with the seven lamps <a id="l1180"></a>in the seven golden candlesticks which are the seven churches of Asia. And the <a id="l1181"></a>Dragon signifies the same empire with  Daniels He goat in the reign of his last <a id="l1182"></a>horn,  that is, the whole Roman empire untill it become divided into the Greek <a id="l1183"></a>&amp; Latin empires; &amp; after that division the Greek Empire alone. And the Beast is <a id="l1184"></a>Daniels fourth Beast,  that is the Empire of the latines &amp; is included in the body of the Dragon before <a id="l1185"></a>the division, &amp; after the division is the Latin Empire alone. And hence the Dragon &amp; <a id="l1186"></a>Beast have the same heads &amp; horns, but the heads are croned upon the Dragon &amp; <a id="l1187"></a>the horns upon the Beast.  Before the woman fled into the wilderness she  <a id="l1188"></a> being with child (of a Christian Empire) cried travailing (in Dioclesians persecution,) &amp; pained to be delivered <a id="l1189"></a>&amp; the Dragon (the heathen Empire) stood before her to devour her child as soon as it was born <a id="l1190"></a>And she brought forth a man child who (at length) was to rule all nations with a rod of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022r"> &lt;22r&gt; </span> iron. And her child was caught up unto God &amp; to his throne (in the Temple) &amp; the <a id="l1191"></a>woman fled (from the temple on mount Sion) into the wilderness [of Arabia  to Babylon] <a id="l1192"></a>where she hath a place (of riches honour &amp; dominion upon the back of the Beast) <a id="l1193"></a>prepared of God, that they should feed her there 1260 days. And there was war <a id="l1194"></a>in heaven (between the heathen &amp; new Christian Empire) And the Dragon was cast <a id="l1195"></a>out that old serpent which deceiveth the whole world (the spirits of heathen idolatry) he was (by the victory of Constantine over  <a id="l1196"></a> Maxentius &amp; Maximinus) cast out  to the earth.  to the earth (the regions of Asia under Licinius. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb &amp; by the <a id="l1197"></a>word of their testimony.  And they loved not their lives unto the <a id="l1199"></a>death. And when the Dragon saw that we was cast down he persecuted the woman which <a id="l1200"></a>brought forth the man child (&amp; this he did in the reign of Licinius.) And to the woman (by <a id="l1201"></a>the building of Constantinople &amp; equalling it to Rome) were given two wings of a great <a id="l1202"></a>eagle that she might fly into the wilderness to her place [upon the back of the Beast)  <a id="l1203"></a>where she is nourished a time times &amp; half a time from the face of the serpent (or Da<a id="l1204"></a>gon.) And the serpent [upon the death of Constantine the great] cast  out waters as <a id="l1205"></a>a flood [the western Empire under Constantine junior &amp; Constans] after the woman, that he <a id="l1206"></a>might cause her to be carried away of the flood. And the earth [the nations of Asia <a id="l1207"></a>now under Constantinople] helped the woman &amp; [by conquering the Western Empire <a id="l1208"></a>under Magnentius] swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth. And the <a id="l1209"></a>Dragon was wroth with the Woman &amp; went to make war with the remnant of her seed <a id="l1210"></a>which kept the commandments of God &amp; had the testimony of Iesus, &amp; which in that war <a id="l1211"></a>were sealed out of all the twelve tribes of Israel &amp; remains upon mount Sion in the <a id="l1212"></a>temple with the lamb being in number 144000 &amp; having his fathers name written on their foreheads. </p>
            <p id="par78">And when the earth had swallowed up the flood &amp; the Dragon was gone to make war <a id="l1223"></a>with the remnant of the womans seed, Iohn stood upon the sand of the sea &amp; saw the beast <a id="l1224"></a>with seven heads &amp; ten horns rise out of the Sea; &amp; the Beast was like unto a Leopard &amp; his feet <a id="l1225"></a>as the feet of a Bear &amp; his mouth as the mouth of  Lyon. Iohn here names Daniels four Beasts in order beginning with the fourth <a id="l1226"></a>&amp; going upwards to the first,  to signify that this Beast is the same with Daniels <a id="l1227"></a>fourth beast. And the Dragon gave him his power &amp; his throne &amp; great authority by relinquishing <a id="l1228"></a>the Western Empire to him. And one of his heads was as it were wounded to death (by the sword <a id="l1229"></a>of the Earth which swallowed up the waters,) &amp; his deadly wound was healed. It was healed at <a id="l1230"></a>the division of the Empire between Valentinian &amp; Valens A. C. 364. Iohn saw the Beast rise <a id="l1231"></a>out of the sea at the division thereof between Gratian &amp; Theodosius A. C. 379. And the <a id="l1232"></a>Dragon gave the Beast his power &amp; his throne &amp; great authority  at the death of <a id="l1233"></a>Theodosius when he gave the western Empire to his   younger son Honorius. After <a id="l1234"></a>which the two empires were no more united. But the western Empire beame presently <a id="l1235"></a>divided into ten kingdoms as above, &amp; these kingdoms at length united in religion under the woman &amp; <a id="l1236"></a>reigned  with her forty &amp; two months.</p>
                <p id="par79">And Iohn beheld another Beast coming out of the earth. When the woman fled from <a id="l1237"></a>the Dragon into the kingdom of Beast,  <a id="l1238"></a>&amp; became his church, this other Beast rose up out of the earth to represent the church <a id="l1239"></a>of the Dragon. For he had two horns like the lamb the Bishpricks of Alexandria &amp; Antioch <a id="l1240"></a>, &amp; he spoke as the Dragon in  matters of religion. And he causet the <a id="l1241"></a>earth or nations of the Dragons kingdom to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was <a id="l1242"></a>healed, that is,  receive his religion. And he doth great wonders so that he maketh fire come <a id="l1243"></a>down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, that is,  he excommunicated those that <a id="l1244"></a>differ from him in point of religion. For in pronouncing their excommunications they used to swing <a id="l1245"></a>down a lighted torch from above. And he said to them that dwell on the earth that they should <a id="l1246"></a>make an image to the Bestst which had the wound by a sword &amp; did revive, that is, that <a id="l1247"></a>they should call a Council of men of the religion of this beast. And he had power to <a id="l1248"></a>give life to the Image <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>lent<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the image should both speak &amp; cause that as many as would not worship the image <a id="l1249"></a>of the Beast should be killed viz mystically by dissolving their churches. And he causeth all both smal <a id="l1250"></a>&amp; great, rich &amp; poor, bond &amp; free to receive a mark in their right hands or in their <a id="l1251"></a>foreheads, that no man might by y or sell save he that had the mark  or the name of <a id="l1252"></a>the beast or the number of his name: all others being excommunicated. And while the twelve <a id="l1253"></a>tribes that received the mark of the Beast:  &amp; the candlesticks of the churches of Asia <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021v-b"> &lt;21v-b&gt; </span> were removed out of their places, there were 144000 sealed out of all the twelve tribes <a id="l1254"></a>. And these remain with the Lamb on mount Sion having the name of God on <a id="l1255"></a>their foreheads. And they sing a new song before the throne which no man else could learn &amp; are <a id="l1256"></a>not defiled with weomen such as are the whore of Babylon &amp; other idolatrous churches. And <a id="l1257"></a>these are the two witnesses or prophets, which, after the first temple by the flight of the woman &amp; the war which the <a id="l1258"></a>Dragon made upon the remnant of  her seed, is destroyed, do prophesy  at the building of a second temple like the two prophets Haggai &amp; Zechary. <a id="l1260"></a>And at length when the woman arrives at her place of riches &amp; dominion upon the <a id="l1261"></a>back of her Beast, they put on sackcloth &amp; prophesy in sackcloth all the time that <a id="l1262"></a>she reigns over the Beast, that is, 1260 days, or 42 months or a time times &amp; half a <a id="l1263"></a>time.  These are the two Olive branches that supply the lamps with oyle. These are the two candlesticks, that is two of the seven golden candlesticks. <a id="l1264"></a>For five of the seven churches of Asia (those in prosperity) are found fault with, &amp; <a id="l1265"></a>exhorted to repent, &amp; threatned to be removed out of their places, &amp; spewed out of <a id="l1266"></a>Christ's mouth, or  punished with the sword of his mouth  or otherwise except <a id="l1267"></a>they repent; &amp; the other two (the Churhces of Smyrna &amp; Philadelphia) which were under <a id="l1268"></a>persecution remain in  a state of persecution to illuminate the second temple. When the  <a id="l1269"></a>primitive Church catholick represented by the Woman in heaven apostatured &amp; became divided into <a id="l1270"></a>two  corrupt Churches represented by the Whore of Babylon &amp;  the two horned <a id="l1271"></a>Beast, the 144000 which were sealed out of all the twelve tribes being diffused  into the two <a id="l1272"></a>empires of the Greeks &amp; Latines,  became the two witnesses in opposition <a id="l1275"></a>to the two fals churches represented by the whore of Babylon &amp; the two horned beast: <a id="l1276"></a>&amp; the name of two witnesses  once imposed  remains to the true Church of God <a id="l1277"></a>in all places &amp; times to the end of this prophesy.</p>

And from thence it has <a id="l1300"></a>spread also into all the nations on the north side of the Empire,  Dacia, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, <a id="l1302"></a>Poland, . Dacia being conquered by Trajan received the Christian <a id="l1303"></a>religion very early, sent its Patriarch to the Council of Nice, &amp; was gene<a id="l1304"></a>rally converted before  its inhabitants the Goths &amp; Vandals invaded the Empire <a id="l1305"></a>Irenæus lets us know that the Christian religion was in a flourishing  <a id="l1306"></a>state in  Germany in the middle of the second century. Afterwards <a id="l1307"></a>Charles the great propagated the Roman religion into all Germany by <a id="l1308"></a>conquest &amp; from thence it began at the same time to spread into Denmark <a id="l1309"></a>Suedeland &amp; Poland. </p>
            <p id="par81">So then the Christian world which is the subject of this Prophesy consists <a id="l1312"></a>of three parts or Tribes:: the third Monarchy or Greek Empire, the fourth Mo<a id="l1313"></a>narchy or Latine Empire, &amp; the northern nations. And these three parts being pretty nearly equal, you may know by this division that <a id="l1314"></a> the third part of the earth, sea, rivers, sun, moon &amp; <a id="l1315"></a>stars is the third part of this Christian world, or the earth, sea, rivers, Sun, <a id="l1316"></a>Moon &amp; Stars of one of these three parts. And this unfolds to us the <a id="l1317"></a>mystery of counting the number of the Beast. For the name &amp; num<a id="l1318"></a>ber of the Beast is opposed to the name of God &amp; to the number of <a id="l1319"></a>his servants who stand on mount Sion with his name of their foreheads. <a id="l1320"></a>And in that respect the number  of the Beast 666 is to be <a id="l1321"></a>counted in such a manner as the number of Gods servants 144000 <a id="l1322"></a>was counted. This number was counted by multiplying 12000 by its' <a id="l1323"></a>divisor 12 the number of Tribes of Israel (Apoc. 7) &amp; therefore <a id="l1324"></a>666 is to be counted by multiplying some number by a divisor of <a id="l1325"></a>that number. And there is but one way of counting it in this <a id="l1326"></a>manner, which is, by multiplying 222 by 3 the number of the Tribes <a id="l1327"></a>of them that worship the Beast.</p>
            <p id="par82">The four Monarchies are still in being &amp; the four Beasts represent<a id="l1328"></a>ing them are still alive. For the lives of the three first Beasts <a id="l1329"></a>were prolonged after their dominions were taken away.  They  continue till a <a id="l1330"></a>stone cut out of a mountain without hands brake in pieces at once <a id="l1331"></a>all the four parts of Nebuchadnezzar's Image, the gold, the silver, the brass <a id="l1332"></a>&amp; the iron. And since all Daniels Beasts were alive in Iohn's days &amp; <a id="l1333"></a>still continue alive &amp; therefore are synchronal to Iohn's Beasts, &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024r"> &lt;24r&gt; </span> Iohn's prophesy was given by the same Holy Ghost with Daniels <a id="l1334"></a>&amp; is very full of Allusions to the Prophesies of the old testament: <a id="l1335"></a>we may expect to find Daniel's Monarchies in Iohn's prophesy <a id="l1336"></a>so far as they relate to the Christian religion. And therefore <a id="l1337"></a>we ought to compare the prophesies of Daniel &amp; Iohn, &amp; <a id="l1338"></a>agree them together so far as they can be made to agree without <a id="l1339"></a>straining. For there is no better way of interpreting scripture <a id="l1340"></a>then by comparing the parts of it, &amp; reconciling all the <a id="l1341"></a>synchronal &amp; all the analogous parts of  prophesy which can <a id="l1342"></a>be reconciled without force. Tis certain that the same <a id="l1343"></a>things are described again &amp; again in prophesy. And all <a id="l1344"></a>the descriptions of one &amp; the same thing must be con<a id="l1345"></a>joyned that they may interpret one another; &amp; supply <a id="l1346"></a>one anothers defects, &amp; joyntly make one complete <a id="l1347"></a>description which cannot be misapplyed. And those inter<a id="l1348"></a>pretations are always to be preferred which reduce the <a id="l1349"></a>parts of scripture to the greatest consent &amp; harmony. <a id="l1350"></a>Daniel has described the same monarchies, again &amp; <a id="l1351"></a>again in four several prophesies, &amp; yet the words of <a id="l1352"></a>those descriptions were shut up &amp; sealed till the time <a id="l1353"></a>of the end. Iohn's prophesy is a Revelation of what was <a id="l1354"></a>shut up &amp; sealed before, &amp; therefore must be compared <a id="l1355"></a>with Daniel's that all may be understood.</p>
                    <p id="par83">The people of the first &amp; second Monarchies beyond <a id="l1356"></a>Armenia &amp; the river Tigris were never yet conver<a id="l1357"></a>ted to Christianity. The third Monarchy founded by Alex<a id="l1358"></a>ander the great, was propagated through the Roman Empire <a id="l1359"></a>&amp; after separation from the Latines was seated at Con<a id="l1360"></a>stantinople &amp; is now under the dominion of the Turks. <a id="l1361"></a>This was the principal seat of the Christian religion in the <a id="l1362"></a>primitive times &amp;  is represented in the Apocalyps by <a id="l1363"></a>the great red Dragon. The fourth Monarchy being founded <a id="l1364"></a>by the Latines conquered the Greeks then separated from them <a id="l1365"></a>&amp; breaking into ten kingdoms has ever since continued in a <a id="l1366"></a>divided form. This received the Christian religion from the <a id="l1367"></a>Greeks in the primitive times, &amp; is represented in the Apo<a id="l1368"></a>calyps by the Beast rising out of the sea with ten horns. <a id="l1369"></a>When the Greek &amp; Latine Empires are united the Dragon &amp; <a id="l1370"></a>Beast are united &amp; the whole is both Dragon &amp; Beast; but <a id="l1371"></a>when they are divided, the Greek Empire is the Dragon &amp; <a id="l1372"></a>the Latine the Beast. At first the Dragon signifies the <a id="l1373"></a>whole Roman Empire: but when the Empire become di<a id="l1374"></a>vided the Dragon signifies only the Greek Empire, &amp; the <a id="l1375"></a>Beast rises out of the Sea to signify the Latine. Before <a id="l1376"></a>the division the Dragon reigns over the inhabitants of the <a id="l1377"></a>Earth &amp; sea, &amp; the Beast is latent in him. Upon the divi<a id="l1378"></a>sion the Beast rises out of the inhabitants of the Sea in a <a id="l1379"></a>distinct &amp; separate form, &amp; succeeds the Dragon in his marine </p>

            <h2 id="hd6" class="cent">Chap. IV. <a id="l1380"></a><br>Of the Kingdoms and Churches which are <a id="l1381"></a>the subject of the Prophesy.</h2><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup>
            <p id="par84">The nations within the bounds of the four Monarchies <a id="l1383"></a>are the subject of sacred Prophesy, &amp; consist of three equal parts: <a id="l1384"></a>the nations of the western Roman Empire or Empire of the Latines, <a id="l1385"></a>the nations of the eastern Roman Empire or Empire of the <a id="l1386"></a>Greeks &amp; the nations of the Persian Empire including Chaldea <a id="l1387"></a>&amp; Assyria. And wherever this Prophesy mentions a third part of any <a id="l1388"></a>thing, as a third part of the earth, sea, rivers, Sun, Moon or stars, <a id="l1389"></a>it relates to one of these three parts.</p>
            <p id="par85">This prophesy being given by Christ, is a Revelation of such <a id="l1390"></a>things as principally concern the Christian religion, &amp; therefore relates <a id="l1391"></a>chiefly to those kingdoms in which the Christian religion flourished most <a id="l1392"></a>&amp; which were converted to Christianity, that is to the Roman Empire. <a id="l1393"></a>This Empire was at first united under one Monarch &amp; afterwards <a id="l1394"></a>became divided into the Greek &amp; Latin Empires. The Latin Empire <a id="l1395"></a>is the fourth Beast of Daniel or fourth Monarchy strictly so called <a id="l1396"></a>which was to stand till the judgment should sit &amp; the Son of man <a id="l1397"></a>should come in the clouds to the ancient of days &amp; the saints <a id="l1398"></a>should take the kingdom. The Greek Empire is the third Monarchy <a id="l1399"></a>or third Beast whose life is still prolonged tho its dominion hath <a id="l1400"></a>been taken away. This Monarchy comprehending the nations of Greece, <a id="l1401"></a>Asia Minor, Syria &amp; Egypt was represented at first by the four <a id="l1402"></a>heads &amp; four wings of the Leopard &amp; by the four horns of the <a id="l1403"></a>He-goat, &amp; afterward by the little horn of the He-goat or <a id="l1404"></a>kingdom of Pergamus, which by the last will &amp; testament of Attalus <a id="l1405"></a>descending to the Romans grew mighty but not in its own power <a id="l1406"></a>&amp; then separating from them became the Greek Empire reigning <a id="l1407"></a>at Constantinople till the Turks subdued it. The Persian Empire <a id="l1408"></a>comprehends the remainder of the four Monarchies &amp; is still in <a id="l1409"></a>being but hath little to do with the Christian religion.</p>
            
            <p id="par87">In this prophesy the scene of the visions is the Temple &amp; the <a id="l1410"></a>worship of Christians is described in the Temple under the form of <a id="l1411"></a>the Iewish worship, as we shwewed above. And hence the Christian <a id="l1412"></a>Churches are represented in this Prophesy by the twelve tribes <a id="l1413"></a>of Israel, &amp; when some are numbered out of the twelve tribes <a id="l1414"></a>&amp; sealed with the seale of God, the rest of the tribes who are not <a id="l1415"></a>sealed become the synagogue of Satan who say they are Iews &amp; are <a id="l1416"></a>not, that is, who profess themselves Christians but are the Church <a id="l1417"></a>of Satan. For all men whose names are not written in the book of <a id="l1418"></a>life, that is, all who are not sealed with the seale of God, wonder <a id="l1419"></a>after the Beast &amp; worship him &amp; his Image &amp; receive his mark. When <a id="l1420"></a>the saints are numbered &amp; sealed out of the twelve tribes the rest of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span> tribes  receive the mark of the Beast &amp; <a id="l1422"></a>become the Synagogue of Satan, &amp; therefore they that have the <a id="l1423"></a>mark of the Beast &amp; worship him &amp; his Image are Christians in <a id="l1424"></a>outward profession.</p>
            <p id="par88">And as the tribes of Israel &amp; Iudah are in the old Testa<a id="l1425"></a>ment represented by weomen, so the Church of Christ signi<a id="l1426"></a>fied by those Tribes is here represented by the Lamb's wife <a id="l1427"></a>&amp; by the glorious Woman in heaven. For this woman has a <a id="l1428"></a>crown of twelve stars which are the twelve Apostles &amp; her <a id="l1429"></a>seed keep the commandments of God &amp; have the testimony <a id="l1430"></a>of Iesus &amp; therefore she is the Church. This woman flys <a id="l1431"></a>into a spiritually barren wilderness &amp; commits spiritual fornication when the main body of <a id="l1432"></a>the twelve Tribes receive the mark of the Beast &amp; become <a id="l1433"></a>the synagogue of Satan; the remnant of her seed who keep <a id="l1434"></a>the commandments of God being at the same time sealed <a id="l1435"></a>with the seale of God in their foreheads. And therefore after <a id="l1436"></a>her flight into the Wilderness when she commits fornication <a id="l1437"></a>with the kings of the earth &amp; makes all nations drink of the <a id="l1438"></a>wine of her fornication &amp; is drunken with the blood of Saints, <a id="l1439"></a>she signifies an apostate idolatrous persecuting Christian Church Catholic.</p>
            <p id="par89">And since the Woman is the visible Church first in a state of <a id="l1440"></a>purity &amp; afterwards in a state of apostacy; the great red Dra<a id="l1441"></a>gon who persecutes her &amp; stands before her to devour her <a id="l1442"></a>child &amp; the Beast upon whom she afterward sits, that is over <a id="l1443"></a>whom she reigns, must be the Roman Empire through which <a id="l1444"></a>she is diffused &amp; which is the subject of the prophesy. For <a id="l1445"></a>the Dragon &amp; this Beast have several heads &amp; horns like <a id="l1446"></a>Daniel's Beasts which signify kingdoms, &amp; to confirm  that they are kingdoms <a id="l1448"></a>the Dragon has crowns upon his heads &amp; the Beast <a id="l1449"></a>has crowns upon his horns &amp; the heads &amp; horns of the Beast are <a id="l1450"></a>called kings, &amp; the Dragon gives his throne &amp; power <a id="l1451"></a>&amp; authority to the Beast &amp; therefore they are successive <a id="l1452"></a>kingdoms in one &amp; the same throne.</p>
            <p id="par90">In the armies of the Roman Empire both before <a id="l1453"></a>&amp; after the Empire became Christian a flying Eagle was <a id="l1454"></a>the standard of a Legion &amp; a Dragon the standard of a <a id="l1455"></a>Company &amp; in every  Legion there were ten companies &amp; <a id="l1456"></a>by consequence ten Dragons. These Dragons were of a <a id="l1457"></a>purple colour &amp; so fastened to the top of a long pike <a id="l1458"></a>as like weathercocks to turn their tayles from the wind &amp; <a id="l1459"></a>to hiss by means of the wind blowing into their open jaws. <a id="l1460"></a>The bearers of these two sorts of standards were called <a id="l1461"></a>Aquiliferi &amp; Draconarij. And from these badges of the Roman <a id="l1462"></a>Empire this Empire is represented in the second book of Esdras by <a id="l1463"></a>an Eagle &amp; in this prophesy by a great Eagle whose two wings <a id="l1464"></a>were given to the woman that she might fly into the wilder<a id="l1465"></a>ness, &amp; by a great red Dragon who persecutes her. And to repre<a id="l1466"></a>sent the idolatrous religion &amp; large extent of the Empire this Dragon is called the Devil <a id="l1467"></a>&amp; Satan who deceives the whole world.</p>
            <span class="pagenumber" id="p027r"> &lt;27r&gt; </span>
            <p id="par91">The first Beast by the number of his horns &amp; other cha<a id="l1468"></a>racters is manifested to be the same with Daniels fourth Beast. <a id="l1469"></a>For both had ten horns &amp; Daniel's had an eleventh horn which <a id="l1470"></a>answers to the Woman on the back of Iohn's Beast. For this <a id="l1471"></a>horn was an Animal   distinct from the Beast, having eyes like the eyes of <a id="l1472"></a>a man &amp; a mouth speaking great things against the most <a id="l1473"></a>High, &amp; so was a Seer &amp; a Prophet or Prophetess exercising <a id="l1474"></a>a jurisdiction in matters of religion  &amp; having power to change  time &amp; laws &amp; the woman (Iezebel) <a id="l1475"></a> calleth her self a Prophetess &amp; deceives all nations with <a id="l1476"></a>her sorceries &amp; inebriates them with the wine of her fornica<a id="l1477"></a>tion. The horn made war upon the saints &amp; prevailed against <a id="l1478"></a>them &amp; the Woman was drunken with the blood of saints &amp; <a id="l1479"></a>of the martyrs of Iesus &amp;  in her was found the blood <a id="l1480"></a>of  Prophets &amp; Saints &amp; of all that were slain upon the <a id="l1481"></a>face of the earth. The horn had a look more stout then <a id="l1482"></a>his fellows &amp; the woman reigns over the ten horns, for she <a id="l1483"></a>sits upon the Beast &amp; is called the great city which reigneth <a id="l1484"></a>over the kings of the earth. The Horn reigned with power <a id="l1485"></a>to change times &amp; laws a time times &amp; half a time &amp; the <a id="l1486"></a>woman was fed in her place in the Wilderness a time times &amp; half a <a id="l1487"></a>time. And further, Iohn's Beast is like a <em class="underline">Leopard</em> &amp; hath <a id="l1488"></a>feet as the feet of a <em class="underline">Bear</em> &amp; a mouth as the mouth of <a id="l1489"></a>a <em class="underline">Lion</em> Apoc. 13. 2: which is the description of Daniels fourth <a id="l1490"></a>Beast. For that Beast was dreadful &amp; terrible as a Leopard <a id="l1491"></a>is &amp; fought &amp; stamped with his feet as a Bear doth &amp; <a id="l1492"></a>had great iron teeth wherewith he devoured &amp; broke in <a id="l1493"></a>pieces like a Lion. Daniel's three first Beasts are here <a id="l1494"></a>named backwards &amp; Iohn's is named in the room of the <a id="l1495"></a>fourth  to signify that he is the <a id="l1496"></a>fourth, &amp; is described also of lke shape. And as Daniel's Beast reigned <a id="l1497"></a>in the little horn  a time times &amp; half a time, or three <a id="l1498"></a>years &amp; an half so Iohn's reigned 42 months' which is also <a id="l1499"></a>three years &amp; an half. And lastly as Daniel's fourth Beast <a id="l1500"></a>has Rome for its metropolis so has Iohn's; for the heads of Iohn's Beast <a id="l1501"></a>are called seven hills where the Woman sitteth, which is as much as <a id="l1502"></a>to say that the head city or metropolis of the Beast is the seven-hilled <a id="l1503"></a>city over which the Woman reigneth. She sits on the Beast, that <a id="l1504"></a>is, reigns over him, &amp; therefore is his Metropolis. She is also called <a id="l1505"></a>the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth &amp; Babylon <a id="l1506"></a>the great city: which name imports that she is that great city which should <a id="l1507"></a> beseige Ierusalem, burn the Temple &amp; captivate the Iews as <a id="l1508"></a>Babylon had done before. And therefore Peter writing from Rome in <a id="l1509"></a>the time of that siege &amp; alluding in many things to the Apocalyps, <a id="l1510"></a>calls Rome by the name of Babylon. For all antiquity agree that Peter <a id="l1511"></a>wrote his epistles from Rome &amp; by Babylon understood that city.</p>
            <p id="par92">When the ten horned Beast rose out of the sea, the Dragon <a id="l1512"></a>gave him his power &amp; his throne &amp; great authority, Apoc 13. 2: And <a id="l1513"></a>therefore the Dragon reigned first in the Roman Empire. He reigned <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p028r"> &lt;28r&gt; </span> alone over the whole Empire while the Empire continued in one Mon<a id="l1514"></a>archy, &amp; when it became divided into the eastern &amp; western <a id="l1515"></a>Empires, the Beast rose out of the sea by that division &amp; the <a id="l1516"></a>Dragon gave his old throne the city Rome with its dominion, that <a id="l1517"></a>is, his western power &amp; throne, to the Beast, &amp; retained only his <a id="l1518"></a>eastern power to himself. For the Dragon did not cease at the <a id="l1519"></a>rise of the Beast. After the Beast was risen they worshipped <a id="l1520"></a>the Dragon &amp; Beast together (Apoc. 13. 4) &amp; at length three un<a id="l1521"></a>clean spirits like froggs came out of the mouths of the Dragon <a id="l1522"></a>&amp; Beast &amp; fals Prophet (Apoc 17. 13) &amp; in the end, when the Beast <a id="l1523"></a>is cast into the Lake of fire, the Dragon is cast into the bottomless <a id="l1524"></a>pit (Apoc. 20. 2) The Dragon &amp; Beast therefore after the divi<a id="l1525"></a>sion of the Roman Empire continue in being together &amp; by con<a id="l1526"></a>sequence signify the eastern &amp; western or Greek &amp; Latine <a id="l1527"></a>Empires. This Dragon is the Devil &amp; Satan (Apoc. 12.  9) that <a id="l1528"></a>Satan who had his seat in Pergamus (Apoc. 2. 13) that is, the <a id="l1529"></a>Kingdom of Pergamus represented by  the last <a id="l1530"></a>horn of Daniel's He-Goat, whose dominion by the last Will &amp; <a id="l1531"></a>testament of Attalus descended to the Romans &amp; who grew <a id="l1532"></a>mighty in their power &amp; at length separating from them <a id="l1533"></a>became the Greek Empire reigning over the nations of Greece, <a id="l1534"></a>Asia minor, Syria &amp; Egypt; which made up the proper body of <a id="l1535"></a>Daniel's He-Goat, &amp; of his Leopard or third Beast. The little <a id="l1536"></a>horn of the He Goat waxed great even to the host of heaven, <a id="l1537"></a>&amp; it cast down of the host &amp; of the stars to the ground &amp; <a id="l1538"></a>stamped upon them &amp; the Dragon's tail drew the third part <a id="l1539"></a>of the stars of heaven, &amp; cast them to the earth. These acti<a id="l1540"></a>ons are the same signification: for the horn of the Goat <a id="l1541"></a>&amp; tail of the Dragon are their fighting members &amp; signify <a id="l1542"></a>their military powers or armies commanded by their kings <a id="l1543"></a>By the agreement of their actions you may know that they <a id="l1544"></a>are one &amp; the same kingdom.</p>
            <p id="par93">The Greeks called themselves Romans &amp; gave the <a id="l1545"></a>name of Romania to the Region about Constantinople, &amp; <a id="l1546"></a>distinguished themselves from those of the Western Empire <a id="l1547"></a>by the names of Greeks &amp; Latines. Whence the word <a id="l1548"></a>ΔΑΤΕΙΝΟΣ is the proper name of the western Empire. <a id="l1549"></a>This is the name of a man (an ancient king from whence the Latines had their name) &amp; the number of this <a id="l1550"></a>name is 666 &amp; this is the number of the name of the <a id="l1551"></a>Beast.</p>
            <p id="par94">The nations of the Roman Empires are also distinguished <a id="l1552"></a>into two parts by the names of earth &amp; sea: as where the first plague <a id="l1553"></a>falls on the earth, the second on the sea, &amp; where the <a id="l1554"></a>Devil comes down to the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea <a id="l1555"></a>&amp; where the ten-horned Beast rises out of the  sea &amp; the <a id="l1556"></a>two horned Beast out of the earth. And  this distinction seems occasioned by the language of the Iews who called these countries the earth to which they travelled by land &amp; those the Isles of the sea &amp; Isles of the Gentiles to which they  went by sea. And according to this language, the Sea in Iohn's days was Europe &amp; the Earth was Asia &amp; Afric, &amp; the Mountains &amp; Islands are the reigning cities of the earth &amp; sea with their territories. And because the eastern Empire was seated chiefly in this earth &amp; the western chiefly in this sea: by the earth &amp; sea we may sometimes understand these Empires. And since the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p029r"> &lt;29r&gt; </span>  <a id="l1560"></a>ten horned Beast rises out of the sea you may know also by <a id="l1561"></a>that character that he reigns in Europe &amp; is the Western Empire.</p>
            <p id="par95">Every kingdom has its  Church &amp; the na<a id="l1562"></a>tional visible Churches of the Greek &amp; Latine Empires are the  two <a id="l1563"></a> horned Beast &amp; Whore of Babylon. For the Whore is the seven hilled city the western Babylon, &amp; sits upon the <a id="l1564"></a>ten horned Beast or Latine Empire. &amp; in Daniels Prophesies is <a id="l1565"></a>one of his horns &amp; therefore is the Church catholic of the Latines: &amp; the other Beast rises out of the earth or <a id="l1566"></a>nations of the eastern Empire &amp; hath two horns like the Lamb <a id="l1567"></a>that is two churches like the seven churches of Asia signified <a id="l1568"></a>by the  seven horns out of the Lamb, &amp; speaks as the Dra<a id="l1569"></a>gon or eastern Empire &amp; therefore is  of the Dragon's  idolatrous religion <a id="l1570"></a>them that dwell on the earth &amp; for  doing so is called the <a id="l1571"></a>fals Prophet &amp; therefore is of an ecclesiastical kind, &amp; this <a id="l1572"></a>fals Prophet survives the Whore beign cast alive into the <a id="l1573"></a>Lake of fire after the ten kings have eaten the flesh of the <a id="l1574"></a>Whore &amp; burnt her with fire, &amp; therefore this Prophet <a id="l1575"></a>differs from the whore &amp; signifies another idolatrous <a id="l1576"></a>Church &amp; by consequence the Church of the Greek Empire. <a id="l1577"></a>Conceive therefore that while the Roman Empire continues <a id="l1578"></a>entire the whole is signified by the Dragon &amp; the church <a id="l1579"></a> in the whole by the glorious woman in heaven: but <a id="l1580"></a>when the Empire becomes divided, the woman degenerates <a id="l1581"></a>&amp; flyes from the Dragon into the western empire called <a id="l1582"></a>a wilderness for its spiritual barrenness, &amp; leaves a <a id="l1583"></a>remnant of her seed in the eastern empire which keep the <a id="l1584"></a>commandments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus; <a id="l1585"></a>&amp; that the Dragon at the same time goes from the wo<a id="l1586"></a>man into the eastern empire to make war with the <a id="l1587"></a>remnant of her seed, &amp; a ten-horned Beast rises out of <a id="l1588"></a>the sea or western nations to succeed the Dragon in the <a id="l1589"></a>western empire, &amp; a two-horned Beast rises out of the <a id="l1590"></a>Earth or Eastern nations  to succeed the woman <a id="l1591"></a>in the eastern empire, &amp; a new Temple is measured in order <a id="l1592"></a> to be built with two Candlesticks in it to represent the saints within the empire of the Beast of whom it is said that power was given unto him to make war with the Saints &amp; to overcome them. For Candlesticks are Churches &amp; the two Candlesticks are two Churches called the two Witnesses &amp; the Beast makes war against these Witnesses &amp; overcomes them &amp; kills them in the streets  or provinces of the great City Babylon which in the form of a woman reigns over him, &amp; therefore they are those saints. And by analogy, the seven candlesticks in the first Temple are Gods people in the empire of the Dragon, a finite number being put for an indefinite. For these Candlesticks are the churches of Asia &amp; by consequence within the Dragons kingdom. Conceive therefore that when the Dragon is the whole Roman empire the seven Candlesticks signify the Churches of the whole Empire: but when the Empire becomes divided &amp;  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030r"> &lt;30r&gt; </span>  &amp; the Dragon retires into the east, the Candlesticks  become the remnant of the womans seed with whom the Dragon makes war, &amp; are succeeded <a id="l1609"></a>in the Western Empire by two Candlesticks placed in a new Temple to sig<a id="l1610"></a>nify the saints with whom the Beast makes war. For the <a id="l1611"></a>seven Candlesticks do not cease at the division of the Empire <a id="l1612"></a>but continue in the first Temple to the end of the prophesy; <a id="l1613"></a>the seven Angels which sound the Trumpets &amp; pour out the Vials <a id="l1614"></a>bring their lamps, &amp; the Church of Pergamus lasting till Christ <a id="l1615"></a>comes &amp; fights against the Nicolaitans with the sword of his mouth <a id="l1616"></a>&amp; that of Sardis till Christ comes as a thief, &amp; the Church of Thy<a id="l1617"></a>ativa being to hold fast what they have till Christ comes. So then <a id="l1618"></a>the  Greek &amp; Latine Empires with their Churches <a id="l1619"></a>false &amp; true are represented by the Dragon &amp; first Beast, the fals <a id="l1620"></a>Prophet &amp; Whore, the seven  Candlesticks in the first temple &amp; the two <a id="l1621"></a>Candlesticks in the second. For it was fit that all these things <a id="l1622"></a>should be represented distinctly. They have also their joynt repre<a id="l1623"></a>sentation. For the twelve Tribes of Israel represent all Christians <a id="l1624"></a>good &amp; bad in both Empires; &amp; the 144000 servants of God repre<a id="l1625"></a>sent all the good, they being numbered &amp; sealed out of the nations of the earth <a id="l1626"></a>&amp; sea which were to be hurt by the four winds as soon as the sealing <a id="l1627"></a>was finished; &amp; they that worship the Beast &amp; receive his mark <a id="l1628"></a>represent all the bad, he being worshipped as well by the Dragons <a id="l1629"></a>subjects as by his own.</p>
            <p id="par96">We shewed above that the first six heads  of the Beast <a id="l1630"></a>fell before he ascended out of the abyss. For before he ascended <a id="l1631"></a>he was latent in the Dragon's body, being the water which the Dra<a id="l1632"></a>gon cast out of his mouth as a flood after the woman to cause her <a id="l1633"></a>to be carried away of the flood. For waters are peoples &amp; nations <a id="l1634"></a>&amp; multitudes &amp; tongues &amp;  aggregate of waters as a river or <a id="l1635"></a>flood or sea is a body politique or kingdom, &amp; the western Empire <a id="l1636"></a>has a particular relation to the watry element, the Beast afterwards rising <a id="l1637"></a>out of the sea &amp; the Woman sitting upon many waters. As the <a id="l1638"></a>woman was flying westward he cast this flood after her &amp; <a id="l1639"></a>therefore the flood is a western kingdom. She fled into the <a id="l1640"></a>wilderness by a division of the Empire &amp; the Dragon cast <a id="l1641"></a>out of his mouth this flood after her to cause her to be <a id="l1642"></a>carried away by it, &amp; therefore the casting of this flood out <a id="l1643"></a>of his mouth signifies that division &amp; while the water was <a id="l1644"></a>in the Dragon's belly the Beast was latent in him &amp; for <a id="l1645"></a>that reason has all the Dragons heads. This Beast was <a id="l1646"></a>Daniel's fourth Beast &amp; that Beast was the Roman Empire <a id="l1647"></a>from the time that the Romans subdued the Greeks &amp; in <a id="l1648"></a>that respect the whole Roman Empire is the Beast as well <a id="l1649"></a>as the Dragon before the division thereof. And thence it is that <a id="l1650"></a>the Dragon &amp; Beast have common heads &amp; common horns; but <a id="l1651"></a>with this difference that the Dragon has crowns upon his heads <a id="l1652"></a>&amp; not upon his horns to signify that he reigns in all the heads <a id="l1653"></a>&amp; not in the horns, &amp; the Beast which is the eighth &amp; of the seven has crowns upon his horns &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p031r"> &lt;31r&gt; </span> not upon his heads to signify that he is not considered in this <a id="l1654"></a>prophesy as reigning before he rises out of the sea by the division of the Empire &amp; the Dragon gives him his throne &amp; his horns receive <a id="l1655"></a>power as kings by a new division of the western Empire into ten <a id="l1656"></a>kingdoms.</p>
            <p id="par97">The occasion of the division of the Empire into the eastern <a id="l1657"></a>&amp; western Empires was the building of Constantinople by <a id="l1658"></a>Constantine the great A. C. 330, &amp; endowing it with a senate <a id="l1659"></a>&amp; privileges like those of Rome &amp; making it the Metro<a id="l1660"></a>polis of all the eastern part of the Empire as Rome had <a id="l1661"></a>hitherto been of all the Empires &amp; was hence forward of <a id="l1662"></a>all the western part thereof. By this division of the <a id="l1663"></a>Empire between two imperial cities, the woman received <a id="l1664"></a>two wings of a great Eagle that she might fly into the <a id="l1665"></a>wilderness, &amp; at the death of Constantine the great A. C. 337, <a id="l1666"></a>the Dragon cast out of his mouth water as a flood after <a id="l1667"></a>the woman to cause her to be carried away of the flood. <a id="l1668"></a>For the Empire at that time became divided between the <a id="l1669"></a>sons of Constantine, his second son Constantius reigning <a id="l1670"></a>over the East &amp; his other two sons reigning in the West <a id="l1671"></a>&amp; the survivor of them reigning over all the west and <a id="l1672"></a>being succeeded by Magnentius in the end of whose reign <a id="l1673"></a>A. C. 353 the earth or eastern empire opened her mouth &amp; swal<a id="l1674"></a>lowed up the flood by a victory over the western Em<a id="l1675"></a>pire whereby the Beast was wounded to death with a <a id="l1676"></a>sword &amp; ceased to be for a time, both Empires becom<a id="l1677"></a>ing unitd under Constantius &amp; his successors till the <a id="l1678"></a>reign of Valentinian &amp; Valens between whom the <a id="l1679"></a>Empire became again divided A. C. 364 &amp; by this division the <a id="l1680"></a>deadly wound was healed &amp; the Beast revived. Then <a id="l1681"></a>by the death of Valens the Empire became united <a id="l1682"></a>again under Gratian the successor of Valentinian <a id="l1683"></a>for about five months &amp; by the next division which was <a id="l1684"></a>between Gratian &amp; Theodosius A. C. 378 the Beast rose <a id="l1685"></a>out of the sea. Gratian reigned with his brother Valenti<a id="l1686"></a>nian in the west. Maximus compassed the death of Gratian <a id="l1687"></a>&amp; made Valentinian fly into the east. Theodosius A. C. 388 <a id="l1688"></a>conquered Maximus &amp; restored Valentinian. Eugenius A. C. <a id="l1689"></a>392 compassed the death of Valentinian &amp; invaded the <a id="l1690"></a>western Empire but Theodosius made his younger son Hono<a id="l1691"></a>rius emperor of the west in the room of Valentinian, con<a id="l1692"></a>quered Eugenius A. C. 394 died three months after &amp; by his <a id="l1693"></a>last Will &amp; testament left the Empire divided between his <a id="l1694"></a>two sons Arcadius &amp; Honorius. After which the two empires were <a id="l1695"></a>united no more. By conquering the west &amp; resigning the con<a id="l1696"></a>quests to Valentinian &amp; Honorius, the Dragon gave the Beast his <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p032r"> &lt;32r&gt; </span> power &amp; throne. The Beast revived before he could ascend <a id="l1697"></a>out of the  sea &amp; asended before the Dragon who stood <a id="l1698"></a>upon the land could give him his power &amp; throne. These were <a id="l1699"></a>three distinct successive acts &amp; imply three successive divisions <a id="l1700"></a>of the empire &amp; can agree to no other then the three last <a id="l1701"></a>divisions, those three to which we have applied them. And now the <a id="l1702"></a>Beast being revived &amp; risen out of the sea &amp; having received <a id="l1703"></a>the Dragon's ancient power &amp; throne became at once divi<a id="l1704"></a>ded into ten kingdoms A. C. 408 409 &amp; 410 which kingdoms <a id="l1705"></a>are the Beast in his last reign which is called the eighth.</p>
            <p id="par98">Before the woman received two wings of a great Eagle <a id="l1706"></a><em class="underline">there was war in heaven Michael &amp; his Angels fought against <a id="l1707"></a>the Dragon &amp; the Dragon fought &amp; his Angels &amp; prevailed not <a id="l1708"></a>neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the <a id="l1709"></a>great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent called the Devil <a id="l1710"></a>&amp; Satan which deceiveth the whole world, he was cast out into <a id="l1711"></a>the earth &amp; his Angels were cast out with him. And I <a id="l1712"></a>heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation <a id="l1713"></a>&amp; strength &amp; the Kingdom of our God &amp; the power of his Christ: <a id="l1714"></a>for the accuser of our brethren is cast down who accused <a id="l1715"></a>them before our God day &amp; night. And they overcame <a id="l1716"></a>him by the blood of the Lamb &amp; by the word of their <a id="l1717"></a>testimony; &amp; they loved not their lives unto the death.</em> This is a very plain description of a great conflict between <a id="l1718"></a>the Roman heathen empire &amp; the army of Christ. For <a id="l1719"></a>Michael &amp; his angels are Christ &amp; his army such an <a id="l1720"></a>army as was accused by the Dragon day &amp; night &amp; loved <a id="l1721"></a>not their lives unto the death, &amp; as overcame the Dragon <a id="l1722"></a>by the blood of the Lamb &amp; by the word of their testimo<a id="l1723"></a>ny; that is, an army of martyrs &amp; confessors. And there<a id="l1724"></a>fore this war between Michael &amp; the Dragon was mana<a id="l1725"></a>ged on the Dragon's part by accusing &amp; persecuting the <a id="l1726"></a>Christians &amp; putting them to death for their religion <a id="l1727"></a>&amp; on the Christians part by confessing &amp; testifying the <a id="l1728"></a>truth of their religion &amp;  persisting in their con<a id="l1729"></a>fession &amp; testimony without fearing to lose their lives <a id="l1730"></a>for the same. And by this conflict the Dragon that old <a id="l1731"></a>serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan, that is, the heathen Ro<a id="l1732"></a>man empire in respect of its religion was overcome &amp; cast <a id="l1733"></a>out of heaven to the earth &amp; was succeeded in the throne <a id="l1734"></a>by a new kingdom called the kingdom of our God. For the <a id="l1735"></a>conflict ended with a voice from heaven saying, <em class="underline">Now is <a id="l1736"></a>come salvation &amp; strength &amp; the KINGDOM of our GOD <a id="l1737"></a>for the accuser of our brethren is cast down.</em> And all this <a id="l1738"></a>can agree to nothing else then the last of the heathen <a id="l1739"></a>Persecutions which began in the reign of Dioclesian &amp; lasted <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p033r"> &lt;33r&gt; </span> almost two years over all the Roman Empire &amp; ten years together <a id="l1740"></a>with great violence over all the east, &amp; was greater then all the <a id="l1741"></a>former heathen persecutions taken together; &amp; which ended in the <a id="l1742"></a>ruin of the heathen Roman Empire &amp; the setting up a Christian <a id="l1743"></a>Empire in its room under Constantine the great.</p>
            <p id="par99">The same revolution is predicted also by the vision of the <a id="l1744"></a>woman who <em class="underline">being</em> great <em class="underline">with child cried travailling in birth <a id="l1745"></a>pained to be delivered,</em> &amp; by the Dragon's <em class="underline">drawing the <a id="l1746"></a>third part of the stars of heaven</em> with his <em class="underline">tail &amp; casting <a id="l1747"></a>them to the earth</em> and <em class="underline">standing before the woman ready to <a id="l1748"></a>be delivered for to devour her child so soon as it was <a id="l1749"></a>born,</em> &amp; by her <em class="underline">bringing forth a Man-child who was to rule <a id="l1750"></a>all nations with a rod iron &amp; was caught up  unto God <a id="l1751"></a>&amp; his throne</em> from the jaws of the Dragon, &amp; her flying <a id="l1752"></a>into the wilderness. For since this parable ends with the <a id="l1753"></a>flight of the woman into the wilderness, &amp; that of the war <a id="l1754"></a>between Michael &amp; the Dragon ends also with the same <a id="l1755"></a>flight, both these parables ending at the same time must <a id="l1756"></a>be synchronal &amp; concern the same revolution of the Empire. <a id="l1757"></a>For describing &amp; pointing out this grand revolution more clearly <a id="l1758"></a>&amp; fully the description is repeated. The woman travailing <a id="l1759"></a>in birth &amp; pained to be delivered signifies the Church in affliction by <a id="l1760"></a>a great persecution which ended in the birth of a Christian <a id="l1761"></a>kingdom &amp; therefore was Dioclesian's persecution: &amp; the same <a id="l1762"></a>persecution is signified by the Dragon's drawing the third <a id="l1763"></a>part of the stars of heaven &amp; casting them to the earth. <a id="l1764"></a>This act shews that the Dragon is the persecutor &amp; the other <a id="l1765"></a>of the woman's being  pained in childbirth that she <a id="l1766"></a>is the person persecuted. The third part of the stars of <a id="l1767"></a>heaven, or starrs of the third part, are the Martyrs &amp; <a id="l1768"></a>Confessors of the provinces of the Greek Empire where the persecution <a id="l1769"></a>was very vehement &amp; lasted ten years together being carried on by Dioclesian, Galenius &amp; Maximinus successively, besides <a id="l1770"></a>what the Christians of that part of the Empire suffered afterwards under Licinius. <a id="l1771"></a>For in the Western  part of the Empire where  Herculius, Constantius &amp; Constantine reigned successively the persecution lasted scarce <a id="l1772"></a>two full years being stopt by Constantius &amp; the Martyrs &amp; confessors were so few &amp; <a id="l1773"></a>made so small an appearance that before the end of the <a id="l1774"></a>two years there were pillars set up by the heathens in <a id="l1775"></a>several parts of Spain with inscriptions signifying that <a id="l1776"></a>the superstition of Christ &amp; name of Christians were every<a id="l1777"></a>where extinguished. The Man-child which the woman brought <a id="l1778"></a>forth is not a single person but a kingdom as Isaias <sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> inter<a id="l1779"></a>prets the type. For the woman is a body polytick &amp; the <a id="l1780"></a>child must be a body of the same kind with the mother. <a id="l1781"></a>And this kingdom was Christian because it was the son of the <a id="l1782"></a>woman &amp; was to rule all nations with a rod of iron which in <a id="l1783"></a>this prophesy is the scepter of Christ's kingdom. The persecution <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p034r"> &lt;34r&gt; </span> began by an Edict for demolishing the Churches &amp; burning the <a id="l1784"></a>sacred books throughout the Empire A. C. 302, &amp; the Man-<a id="l1785"></a>child was born in the western part of the Empire by the <a id="l1786"></a>victory of Constantine the great over Maxentius in the end <a id="l1787"></a>of the persecution A. C. 312, Constantine being encouraged <a id="l1788"></a>by a  vision of a cross in the heavens with this in<a id="l1789"></a>scription <em class="underline">In hoc signo vinces.</em>. And six years after by the <a id="l1790"></a>victory of Constantine over Licinius a heathen persecuting <a id="l1791"></a>Emperor who reigned in the east the Man-child was caught <a id="l1792"></a>up to the throne of the whole Empire A. C. 318. And soon after <a id="l1793"></a>by the building of Constantinople A. C. 330 the Woman re<a id="l1794"></a>ceived two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into <a id="l1795"></a>the wilderness. Conceive that when the Man-child was <a id="l1796"></a>caught up to God, he soon vanished out of sight being here<a id="l1797"></a>after to return from heaven &amp; rule all nations with a rod <a id="l1798"></a>of iron. But before he vanished there was a voice from <a id="l1799"></a>heaven saying, <em class="underline">Now is come salvation &amp; strength &amp; the</em>  <a id="l1800"></a>KINGDOM <em class="underline">of our</em> GOD – – – – <em class="underline">Therefore rejoyce ye heavens <a id="l1801"></a>&amp; ye</em> [saints] <em class="underline">that dwell in them.

And this multitude <a id="l1809"></a>out of temporal ends making hast to profess the Christian <a id="l1810"></a>religion corrupted it with their vicious lives &amp; superstiti<a id="l1811"></a>ous  &amp; idolatrous principles &amp; practices, <a id="l1812"></a>&amp; the Man-child at the same time vanished out of sight &amp; left the <a id="l1813"></a>Dragon that old serpent reigning amongst the inhabitants of the <a id="l1814"></a>earth &amp; sea. And the Dragon soon after gave his ancient western <a id="l1815"></a>throne &amp; authority to the Beast &amp; reigned only in the east untill the <a id="l1816"></a>Man-child returned from heaven to rule all nations with a rod of iron <a id="l1817"></a>For Michael &amp; his angels who in the  persecution of Dioclesian fought <a id="l1818"></a>for the Church against the Dragon, returne in the end of ages under <a id="l1819"></a>the name of the  King of kings with his army on white horses, to fight <a id="l1820"></a>for the Church against the Beast &amp; the kings of the earth &amp; their <a id="l1821"></a>armies.  Michael I say the great Prince when standeth for the people of Daniel,  shall stand up in the great tribulation as he did before in Dioclesians persecution (Dan. XII. 1) &amp; the Beast &amp; fals Prophet being taken &amp; cast into the <a id="l1822"></a>lake of fire, &amp; the Dragon into the bottomless pit, the Manchild <a id="l1823"></a> takes the kingdom &amp; governs all nations with a rod of iron. For <em class="underline">he <a id="l1824"></a>that overcometh &amp; keepeth my works unto the end, to him,</em> saith <a id="l1825"></a>Christ, <em class="underline">will I give power over the nations &amp; he shall rule them <a id="l1826"></a>with a rod of iron</em> (Apoc. 2. 26) &amp; therefore all they that overcome <a id="l1827"></a>&amp; have this power are such a mystical body as is represented by <a id="l1828"></a>the man-child.</p>
            <p id="par100">How the Empire after it became Christian grew exceeding <a id="l1829"></a>vicious would require a large discourse to describe fully: &amp; you may <a id="l1830"></a>satisfy yourself about this matter by reading only the book of Salvian <a id="l1831"></a>de gubernatione Dei written about the year 440 to convince the </p>

            <p id="par103">These things being understood it will not be difficult to describe <a id="l1940"></a>the seven heads of the Dragon.

            <p id="par108">The fift Dynasty was of several Emperors reigning together <a id="l2053"></a>&amp; sharing the Empire amongst them by common consent. This Dynasty <a id="l2054"></a>began with the reign of Dioclesian &amp; Maximianus &amp; ended with the de<a id="l2055"></a>throning of the Dragon by the victory of Constantine the great over <a id="l2056"></a>Licinius. sometimes four or five Emperors reigned at the same time <a id="l2057"></a>in several parts of the Empire. This Dynasty the Romans distinguished from the reigns of the former Empe<a id="l2058"></a>rors by dating from the beginning of it an Æra called the Æra of <a id="l2059"></a>Dioclesian &amp; the Æra of the Martyrs. For this Æra commenced with <a id="l2060"></a>the reign of Dioclesian A. C. 284 Aug. 29, &amp; was in use till the Æra of <a id="l2061"></a>Dionysius prevailed, that is,  about 250 years. Scaliget saith it is still <a id="l2062"></a>in use among the Christians of Afric &amp; Ethiopia. This Æra I consider as a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p039r"> &lt;39r&gt; </span> sufficient argument of the beginning of a new Dynasty, the Romans <a id="l2063"></a>looking upon Dioclesian as the restorer of their Empire.  For in the <a id="l2064"></a>fourth Dynasty it was in great danger of falling, but was restored by Dioclesian <a id="l2065"></a>&amp; his Colleagues to its former greatness &amp; tranquility &amp; enlarged by the <a id="l2066"></a>addition of Assyria &amp; the five Provinces beyond Tigris</p>
            <p id="par109">The sixt Dynasty began with the victory of Michael over the Dragon, the  the manchild being caught up to God &amp; to his throne &amp; the coming down of the Dragon from his throne in heaven to reign in a new throne among <a id="l2067"></a>the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea, that is,  it began with the dethroning of hea<a id="l2068"></a>thenism by the victory of Constantine over Licinius whereby the Empire <a id="l2069"></a>was reduced to a monarchical form. It continued in the family of Con<a id="l2070"></a>stantine till the death of Iulian the Apostate. After Iulian reigned <a id="l2071"></a>Iovian seven months &amp; then the Beast which had been slain with a sword <a id="l2072"></a>revived by a division of the Empire between Valentinian &amp; Valens &amp; rose <a id="l2073"></a>out of the sea by another division of it between Gratian &amp; Theodosius &amp; at <a id="l2074"></a>the death of Theodosius received the Dragons Throne, by which acts a new <a id="l2075"></a> Dynasty commenced gradually.</p>
            <p id="par110">The seventh Dynasty was therefore of the Empire divided <a id="l2076"></a>into the Greek &amp; Latine empires or of the Dragon &amp; Beast reigning <a id="l2077"></a>together. And after this division of the Empire there being no more <a id="l2078"></a>changes common to both Empires to make a new Dynasty of the whole <a id="l2079"></a>the Dragon &amp; Beast have no more common heads then seven. But <a id="l2080"></a>soo after this division the Latin Empire became further divided into <a id="l2081"></a>ten kingdoms which made a new Dynasty of that Empire called the eighth <a id="l2082"></a>&amp; of the seven. &amp; this was the last Dynasty of the Latin Empire <a id="l2083"></a>there being no more changes common to  those kingdoms to make a new <a id="l2084"></a>Dynasty of them  all. So then in the whole Roman Empire <a id="l2085"></a>after the writing of this Prophesy there were seven successive <a id="l2086"></a>Dynasties &amp; no more, &amp; in the  Latin Empire there was an <a id="l2087"></a>eighth &amp; no more: all which Dynasties answer perfectly to the seven <a id="l2088"></a>common heads of the Dragon &amp; Beast &amp;  to the Beast which is the eighth &amp; of the <a id="l2089"></a>seven &amp; received power as a king at the same time with the ten horns, <a id="l2090"></a>being a composition of them all</p>
                <p id="par111">The subject of the Prophesy being described, let us now go over <a id="l2091"></a>the whole Prophesy in due order of time &amp; see how it agrees with history.</p>

            <p id="par112">The nations within the bounds of the four Monarchies are <a id="l2095"></a>the subject of sacred Prophesy,  &amp; consist of three equal parts: the nations of the Western <a id="l2097"></a>Roman Empire or Empire of the Latines, the nations of the <a id="l2098"></a>eastern Roman Empire or Empire of the Greeks, &amp; the nations <a id="l2099"></a>of the Persian Empire including Chaldea. And wherever this Prophesy <a id="l2100"></a>mentions a third part of any thing, as a third part of the earth, sea <a id="l2101"></a>rivers, sun or stars, it relates to one of these three parts.</p>
            <p id="par113">This Prophesy  being given by Christ is a Revelation of such things as principally <a id="l2102"></a>concern the Christian Religion &amp; therefore flourished most &amp; which were con<a id="l2103"></a><br>verted to Christianity, that is to the Roman Empire which was at <a id="l2104"></a>first united under one monarch &amp; afterwards became divided <a id="l2105"></a>into the Greek &amp; Latine Empires. The Latine Empire is the <a id="l2106"></a>fourth Beast of Daniel or fourth Monarchy strictly so called, which was to <a id="l2107"></a>stand till the  judgment should sit &amp; the son of man should <a id="l2108"></a>come into the clouds to the ancient of days &amp; the saints should take the <a id="l2109"></a>kingdom  . The Greek Empire is the third Mo<a id="l2110"></a>narchy or third Beast whose life is still prolonged tho its dominion hath been taken <a id="l2111"></a>away. This monarchy comprehending the nations of Greece, Asia minor, <a id="l2112"></a>Syria &amp; Egypt was  represented at first by the four heads &amp; <a id="l2113"></a>four wings of the Leopard &amp; by the four horns of the He-Goat &amp; <a id="l2114"></a>afterwards by the little horn  of the He Goat <a id="l2115"></a>or kingdom of Pergamus which by the last will &amp; Testament of Attalus descending to the Romans grew mighty <a id="l2116"></a>but not in its one power &amp; then separating from them became the <a id="l2117"></a>Greek Empire  reigning at Constantinople till the Turks subdued it <a id="l2118"></a> The Persian Empire comprehends the remainder of the four Monarchies, &amp; is still in being. The scene of the visions is the <a id="l2120"></a>Temple, &amp; the worship of Christians is,  in this prophesy described in the Temple under the <a id="l2121"></a>form of the Iewish worship  as we shewed above. <a id="l2122"></a>And hence the Christian Churches are represented  in this prophesy by the twelve tribes of Israel &amp;  after a separation of the tribes into two parties the sincere party  is represented by those who are numbered   out of the 12 tribes  &amp; sealed with the seal of God &amp; the synagogue of Satan the Synagogue of Satan who say they are Iews &amp; are <a id="l2123"></a>not, is put for the Church of Satan  the remainder of the twelve tribes who profess themselves Christians <a id="l2124"></a>but  have the mark of the Beast. </p>
            <p id="par114">And as the Tribes of Israel &amp; Iudah are in the old Testament <a id="l2126"></a> represented by weomen, so the church of Christ  signified by those Tribes <a id="l2127"></a>is here represented by the Lambs wife &amp; by the glorious woman in <a id="l2128"></a>heaven. For this Woman has a crown of twelve stars which are the <a id="l2129"></a>twelve Apostles &amp; her seed keep the commandments of God &amp; have the <a id="l2130"></a>testimony of Iesus &amp; therefore she is the Church. This woman flyes into <a id="l2131"></a>a spiritually barren wilderness when the main body of the twelve tribes receive the mark of the Beast &amp; become the <a id="l2132"></a>synagogue of Satan,  the remnant of her seed who keep the <a id="l2133"></a>commandments of God  being at the same time sealed with the seale of God in their foreheads. And therefore after her <a id="l2134"></a>flight   into the Wilderness  when she commits fornication with the kings of the earth &amp; <a id="l2135"></a>makes all nations drink the wine of her fornication,  &amp; is drunken with the blood of saints she signifies an apostate idolatrous persecuting <a id="l2136"></a>Christian Church <a id="l2137"></a>catholick    </p>
            <p id="par115"> &amp; when some are numbred <a id="l2139"></a> out of the 12 tribes &amp; sealed with the seale of God the rest <a id="l2140"></a>of the tribes who are not sealed   are called the synagogue of Satan who say they are Iews &amp; are not, that is who profess <a id="l2141"></a>themselves Christians but are the Church of Satan.  For all men whose names are <a id="l2142"></a>not written in the book of life that is all who are not sealed with the seale of God, wonder after the Beast &amp; worship him &amp; his image <a id="l2143"></a>&amp; receive his mark.

And therefore when the Apostles <a id="l2165"></a>&amp;  churches of the circumcision in Iudea upon the approaching of the Iewish war <a id="l2166"></a> fled  from Iudea &amp; dispersed themselves into all nations &amp; Iohn   went into Asia &amp; there  wrote the Apocalyps &amp; Peter &amp; Mare  went to Rome where Mare wrote his Gospel &amp; Peter wrote <a id="l2168"></a>his Epistles to the strangers dispersed throughout Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia &amp; Bithynia that <a id="l2169"></a>is to the christian Iews who  &amp; were his flock lately fled with him from Iudæa,   sending his first epistle to them by Silvanus the companion of Paul &amp; mentioning <a id="l2171"></a>ing his second Epistle how Paul had also written to them meaning in the epistle to the Hebrews: Peter in these his Epistles alluding in many <a id="l2172"></a>things to the Apocalyps calls Rome by the name of Babylon, intimating by that name that  <a id="l2173"></a>Rome which was then besieging Ierusalem  should  like  old Babylon <a id="l2174"></a>take &amp; destroy the city &amp; temple &amp; captivate the nation of the Iews, as Christ had predicted <a id="l2175"></a>before his death, &amp; therefore was  the great City Babylon  so often mentioned in <a id="l2176"></a>the Apocalyps. For all antiquity agree that Peter wrote his Epistles from Rome &amp; by <a id="l2177"></a>Babylon understood that city. And therefore Peter writing from Rome in the time of that <a id="l2178"></a>siege &amp; alluding in many things to the Apocalyps calls Rome by the name of Babylon.

            <p id="par139">This prophesy is a revelation of such  things as were to come to pass in the Churches   &amp; in the kingdoms or nations through which the churches are diffused, that is, in the  nations of the Roman Empire, &amp; the subject <a id="l2324"></a>of it are    The four Beasts  of Daniel representing the four monarchies are <a id="l2326"></a>all of them still alive &amp; so are his Ram &amp; He Goat  &amp; Iohn's Prophesy is a reve<a id="l2328"></a>lation of what was concealed or obscurely predicted in Daniels, &amp; therefore concerns the  <a id="l2329"></a>nations signified by those beasts &amp; chiefly by those who reign last that is by the ten horned beast &amp;  the he-Goat in the reign of his last horn, both which are the Roman Empire, &amp; comprehend the churches which are the main subject of this prophesy.</p>
            <p id="par140">These Churches are represented in this prophesy by the twelve <a id="l2330"></a>tribes of Israel.  For the scene of the visions is the Temple &amp; the <a id="l2331"></a>worship of Christians is here described under the form of the Iewish <a id="l2332"></a>worship in the temple as we shewed above. And hence the synagogue of Satan who say they <a id="l2333"></a>are Iews &amp; are not, is put for the Church of  Satan who   who profess themselves Christians <a id="l2335"></a>but are  fallen away to idolatry.</p>
            <p id="par141">And as the  Tribes of Israel &amp; Iudah are in the old Testa<a id="l2336"></a>ment frequently represented by a weomen so the Church of Christ signified <a id="l2337"></a>by those Tribes is here represented by the Lambs wife &amp; by a glorious woman in heaven. For this <a id="l2338"></a> woman has a crown of 12 stars which are the 12 Apostles &amp; her seed <a id="l2339"></a>keep the Commandments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus, &amp; <a id="l2340"></a>therefore she is the Church.</p>
            <p id="par142">And since the woman is the Church  in a state of purity &amp; afterwards in a state of Idolatry, the great red Dragon <a id="l2341"></a>who persecutes her &amp; stand stands before her to devoure her child  <a id="l2342"></a>&amp; the Beast upon whose  she  sits, that is, over whom she reigns, must be the Roman Empire through which she is diffused &amp; which is <a id="l2343"></a>the subject of the prophesy.  For the Dragon &amp; first  Beast has  several heads <a id="l2344"></a>&amp; horns like Daniels Beasts which signify kingdoms &amp;  to con<a id="l2345"></a>firm this signification he has crowns upon his heads &amp; the Beast has crowns upon his <a id="l2346"></a>horns &amp; the heads &amp; horns of the Beast are called  kings, &amp; the Dragon <a id="l2347"></a>gives his throne &amp; power &amp; authority to the Beast &amp; therefore they are successive <a id="l2348"></a>kingdoms in one &amp; the same throne.</p>
            
            <p id="par144">In the armies of the Roman Empire, both before &amp; after the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p042v"> &lt;42v&gt; </span> Empire became Christian, a flying Eagle was on the standart of  a <a id="l2350"></a>every Company  Legion &amp; a Dragon on the standarts of  a Company, &amp; in  a   Legion there were ten companies &amp; <a id="l2351"></a>by consequence ten  Dragons. These Dragons were of a purple <a id="l2352"></a>colour &amp; so fastened to the top of a long pike, as, like weathercocks, <a id="l2353"></a>to turn their tayle from the wind &amp; to hiss by means of the wind <a id="l2354"></a>blowing into their open jaws. The bearers of these two sorts of <a id="l2355"></a>standards were called Aquiliferi &amp; Draconarij. And from these badges <a id="l2356"></a>of the Roman Empire, this Empire is represented in the  second <a id="l2357"></a>book of Edras by an Eagle &amp; in this prophesy by a great eagle upon <a id="l2358"></a>whose two wings the woman flyes into the wilderness &amp; by a great <a id="l2359"></a>red Dragon who persecutes her.</p>
            <p id="par145">The first Beast by the number of his horns &amp; other characters <a id="l2360"></a>is manifested to be the same with Daniel's fourth Beast. Both had – <a id="l2361"></a>– – – – Isles of the sea.</p>
            <p id="par146">Every kingdom has its  Church, &amp; the  national <a id="l2362"></a>visible Churches of the  Greek &amp; Latine Empires are the <a id="l2363"></a> fals Prophet &amp; Whore of Babylon. For the  Whore sits upon the  ten horned Beast or Latin Empire <a id="l2365"></a>&amp; reigns over the kings of the earth represented by his horns &amp; <a id="l2366"></a>is at length hated &amp; made desolate by them &amp;  therefore is the church of this Empire &amp; the other Beast: [&amp; the fals Prophet <a id="l2367"></a>  survives the woman &amp; therefore differs from her, being  the other Beast which] arises out of the earth or nations of the east <a id="l2368"></a>&amp; hath two horns like the Lamb  that is  two churches like the seven churches <a id="l2369"></a>of Asia signified by the seven horns of the Lamb &amp; ,  speaks as the Dragon or eastern Empire &amp; therefore is the church of the eastern Empire.  <a id="l2370"></a>This Beast by false miracles deceiveth them that dwell on the earth &amp; for his fals <a id="l2371"></a>miracles &amp; idolatrous doctrine is called the fals Prophet &amp; therefore is of an ecclesiastical kind, &amp; this fals Prophet survives the Whore, being cast alive into the Lake of fire after the ten kings have eaten the flesh of the Whore &amp; burnt her with fire, &amp; therefore this Prophet differs from the Whore &amp; signifies another idolatrous church &amp; by consequence the Church of the Greek Empire. Conceive.  <a id="l2372"></a>therefore that while the Roman Empire continues entire, the whole <a id="l2373"></a>is signified by the Dragon &amp; the Church of the whole by the glorious woman <a id="l2374"></a>in heaven but when the Empire becomes divided, the Woman degenerates &amp; flyes from <a id="l2375"></a>the Dragon into the western Empire called a wilderness for its <a id="l2376"></a>spiritual barrenness &amp; leaves a remnant of her seed in the <a id="l2377"></a>eastern empire which  keep the commandments of God &amp; have <a id="l2378"></a>the testimony of Iesus &amp; that the Dragon at the same time goes <a id="l2379"></a>from the Woman into the eastern Empire to make war with <a id="l2380"></a>that remnant of her seed:  and  a ten-horned <a id="l2381"></a>beast arises out of the sea or western nations to succeed the <a id="l2382"></a>Dragon in the western Empire &amp; a two horned beast rises out <a id="l2383"></a>of the earth or eastern nations to succeed the woman in the eastern <a id="l2384"></a>Empire. And further, to represent the true  Christians or Churches of Christ in both kingdoms, <a id="l2385"></a>conceive that in opposition to the seven hilled City or Woman,  <a id="l2386"></a> the tabernacle &amp; first Temple have in them seven Candlesticks which are put  for the  true Church of Christ <a id="l2387"></a>throughout the  Empire represented by the Dragon, &amp; in opposition to the two <a id="l2388"></a>horned Beast there  is a second Temple measured  in order to be built with <a id="l2389"></a>two Candlesticks in it  which are put for  the true Church of Christ <a id="l2390"></a>throughout the Empire represented by the Beast. For the seven Candle<a id="l2391"></a>sticks  are the seven Churches of Asia &amp; the Churches of Asia are seated within <a id="l2392"></a>the kingdom of the Dragon &amp; by their lamps illuminate his Empire &amp; the <a id="l2393"></a>two Candlesticks are the two  Churches called the two witnesses <a id="l2394"></a>&amp; two Prophets whom the Beast which ascends out of the abyss makes war upon <a id="l2395"></a>&amp; kills in the streets of the great city &amp; therefore they prophesy in   the  kingdom of the Beast &amp; in the streets or provinces of the great city Babylon  which in the form of a woman reigns over him.</p>
            
            <span class="pagenumber" id="p043r"> &lt;43r&gt; </span>
            <p id="par148"> We  shewed  above that the first six heads of the beast <a id="l2399"></a>fell before he ascended out of the abyss. For before he ascended he <a id="l2400"></a>was latent in the Dragons body,  being the water which the <a id="l2401"></a>Dragon cast out of his mouth as a flood after the woman to cause her <a id="l2402"></a>to be carried away of the flood. For Waters are peoples &amp; nations &amp; multitudes <a id="l2403"></a>&amp; tongues, &amp; an aggregate of waters as a river or flood or sea is a body <a id="l2404"></a>politique of kingdom &amp; the western Empire has a particular relation to the watery element the Beast rising out of the sea, &amp; the woman sitting upon many waters.. As the woman was flying westward he cast this flood <a id="l2405"></a>after her &amp; therefore  the flood is a western kingdom. She fled into the <a id="l2406"></a>wilderness by a division of the Empire &amp;  the Dragon cast <a id="l2407"></a>out of his mouth this flood after her to cause her to be carried away by it, &amp; <a id="l2408"></a>therefore the casting of this flood out of  his mouth sifnifies <a id="l2409"></a>that division,  <a id="l2410"></a>&amp; while the water was in the Dragons belly the  Beast or Western Empire <a id="l2411"></a>was latent in him &amp; for that reason has all the Dragons heads.. This Beast was Daniels fourth Beast &amp; that Beast <a id="l2412"></a>was the Roman Empire from the time that the Romans subdued the Greeks <a id="l2413"></a>&amp; in that respect the whole Roman Empire is the Beast as well as <a id="l2414"></a>the Dragon before the division thereof &amp; thence it is that the Dragon <a id="l2415"></a>&amp; Beast have common heads &amp; common horns, But with this difference <a id="l2416"></a>that the Dragon has crowns upon his heads &amp; not upon his horns to signify that he reigns <a id="l2417"></a>in all the heads &amp; not in the horns, &amp; the Beast has crowns upon his <a id="l2418"></a>horns &amp; not upon his heads to signify that he  is not considered <a id="l2419"></a>in the Apocalyps as reigning before   he rises out of the sea by a division of the Empire &amp; receives <a id="l2422"></a>the Dragons ancient throne &amp; power &amp; his horns by a new division of the western <a id="l2423"></a>Empire into ten kingdoms receive power as kings.</p>
            <p id="par149">The  occasion of the division of the Roman Empire into the eastern <a id="l2424"></a>&amp; western Empires was the building of Constantinople by Constan<a id="l2425"></a>tine the great A. C. 330 &amp; endowing it with  a senate &amp; privileges <a id="l2426"></a>like those of Rome &amp; making it the Metropolis of all the eastern <a id="l2427"></a>part of the Empire as Rome had hitherto been of all the Empire <a id="l2428"></a>&amp; was hence forward of all the western part thereof. By this <a id="l2429"></a> division  of the Empire between two imperial Cities the Woman received two wings of a great Eagle that <a id="l2430"></a>she might fly into the wilderness,  &amp; at the death of Constantine <a id="l2431"></a>the great the Dragon cast out of his mouth waters as a <a id="l2432"></a>flood after the woman to cause her to be carried away of the <a id="l2433"></a>flood.  For the Empire  at that time <a id="l2434"></a>became divided between the sons of Constantine, his second son <a id="l2435"></a>Constantius reigning at Constantinople over the east &amp; his other <a id="l2436"></a>two sons reigning in the west &amp; the survivor of them reigning over all the west &amp; being su<a id="l2437"></a>ceeded by Magnentius in whose reign the earth or eastern <a id="l2438"></a>Empire opened her mouth &amp; swallowed up the  flood by a <a id="l2439"></a>victory over the western Empire whereby the Beast was wounded <a id="l2440"></a>to death by a sword &amp; ceased to be for a time, both Empires <a id="l2441"></a>becoming united under Constantius &amp; his successors till the reign of <a id="l2442"></a>Valentinian &amp; Valens between whom the Empire became again divided <a id="l2443"></a>&amp; by this division the deadly wound was healed &amp; the Beast revived: <a id="l2444"></a> Then by the death of Valens the Empire became  united again under <a id="l2445"></a>Gratian the successor of Valentinian for about five months &amp; <a id="l2446"></a>by the next division which was between Gratian &amp; Theodosius the <a id="l2447"></a>Beast rose out of the sea <sup>‡</sup><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the right margin of f 43r &gt; </span> ‡ After which the two Empires became fully united no more. Theodosius indeed in the last three months of his reign united them under himself <a id="l2448"></a>by conquering Eugemius out at the same time they  continued divided between his two sons his elder son Arcadius being created Emperor of the East &amp; his younger son <a id="l2449"></a>Honorius Emperor of the west before this union, &amp; Theodosius in his life time leaving Arcadius in the east &amp; sending for Honorius to reign in the west &amp; at his death confirming this division by his last will &amp; testament. And <a id="l2450"></a>from thence forward the Dragon relinquished his ancient western Throne entirely to the Beast the two Empires being united no more.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 43r resumes &gt; </span>   <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p043v"> &lt;43v&gt; </span> sea &amp; ascended before the  Dragon who stood upon the land could <a id="l2456"></a>give him his power &amp; Throne. These were three distinct successive <a id="l2457"></a>acts &amp; imply three successive divisions of the Empire &amp; can agree <a id="l2458"></a>to no other then the three last divisions, thos three to which we have applied <a id="l2459"></a>them. And now the Beast being revived &amp; risen out of the sea <a id="l2460"></a>&amp; having received the Dragons ancient power &amp; throne becomes <a id="l2461"></a>at once divided into ten kingdoms  [nine of which are <a id="l2462"></a>rent from him &amp; [the tenth is the remainder of his former <a id="l2463"></a>body.] This came to pass in the year 408 or within three or four <a id="l2464"></a>years after as we explained above. Before the Beast ascended out <a id="l2465"></a>of the Abyss they had received no kingdom but by this division re<a id="l2466"></a>ceived power as kings at the same time with the Beast,  that Beast who is called the eighth &amp; of the seven &amp; therefore the reign of his eighth he  The seventh head or dynasty of the Beast com<a id="l2476"></a>menced at his rising out of the sea. This dynasty continued  <a id="l2477"></a>in a monarchical form till the division of this empire into ten <a id="l2478"></a>kingdoms &amp; then began a new dynasty or head  which <a id="l2479"></a>is called the eighth &amp; of the seven, it being the latter part of the <a id="l2480"></a>seventh, &amp; this eighth head is the Beast which was &amp; is not &amp; which <a id="l2481"></a>receives power as a king at the same time with the ten horns, being a <a id="l2482"></a> kingdom composed of all the ten.  This eighth head being pecu<a id="l2483"></a>liar to the Beast I apply it rather to this division into ten kingdoms then to any other chance which <a id="l2484"></a>was common to him &amp; the <a id="l2485"></a>Dragon.</p>
            <p id="par150">A. C. 408, 409 &amp; 410 by which act the ten horns receive power as kings at the same time <a id="l2486"></a>with the Beast  which [was &amp; is not &amp;] is the eighth &amp; of the seven or <a id="l2487"></a>latter part of the seventh head. In the  prophesy of the eighth leaf of the Book which <a id="l2488"></a>began with the  reign of the seventh head/ which kingdoms are the Beast in his last reign <a id="l2489"></a>which is called the eighth.</p>
            <p id="par151">A little before the Woman received two wings of a great Eagle <a id="l2490"></a><em class="underline">there was war in heaven Michael &amp; his Angels fought against the Dragon <a id="l2491"></a>&amp; the Dragon fought &amp; his Angels; &amp; prevalied not . . . . . &amp; they</em> loved not their <a id="l2492"></a>lives unto the death.

And therefore this war between Michael &amp; the <a id="l2497"></a>Dragon was  managed on the Dragons part by accusing &amp; persecuting <a id="l2498"></a>the Christians &amp; putting them to death for their religion &amp; on the Christians <a id="l2499"></a>part by confessing  &amp; testifying the truth of their religion  &amp; persisting in their <a id="l2500"></a>confession  &amp; testimony without fearing to lose their lives for the same <a id="l2501"></a>And  by this conflict  the Dragon that old serpent called the Devil <a id="l2502"></a>&amp; Satan,  that is the heathen Roman Empire in respect of its religion, was <a id="l2503"></a> overcome &amp; cast out of heaven to the earth, &amp; was succeeded in the throne by a <a id="l2504"></a>new kingdom called the kingdom of our God.

            <p id="par153">The whole scene of sacred Prophesy is considered in the <a id="l2515"></a>Apocalyps as composed of three principal parts: the regions <a id="l2516"></a>beyond Euphrates represented by the two first Beasts of Daniel; <a id="l2517"></a>the Empire of the Greeks on this side Euphrates represented by <a id="l2518"></a>the Leopard &amp; his heads &amp; by the He Goat in the reign of his last <a id="l2519"></a>horn; &amp; the Empire of the Latines represented by Daniels fourth <a id="l2520"></a>Beast. To these three parts the phrases of the third part of <a id="l2521"></a>the Sun, Moon, Stars, Earth, Seas, Rivers, Trees, &amp; Ships relate <a id="l2522"></a>The two last of these three parts are sometimes called the <a id="l2523"></a>earth &amp; sea. For by the earth the Iews understood the <a id="l2524"></a>great continent of Asia &amp; Afric to which they had access <a id="l2525"></a>by land, &amp; those places to which they had access by sea they <a id="l2526"></a>called the isles of the sea.</p>
            <p id="par154">The He Goat in the reign of his last horn when he <a id="l2527"></a>was mighty but not by his own power is in the Apocalyps <a id="l2528"></a> represented by a great red Dragon the <a id="l2529"></a>old Serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan. For this Satan is <a id="l2530"></a>there said to have his throne in Pergamus. He continued <a id="l2531"></a>mighty by the power of the Romans will their Empire <a id="l2532"></a>became divided  into the Greek &amp; Latine Empires. <a id="l2533"></a>And then he remained alone in the Greek Empire &amp; gave <a id="l2534"></a>his  Latin throne to the Beast which then rose out of the <a id="l2535"></a>sea with ten horns. Before that division of the Empire <a id="l2536"></a>the Dragon included the nations of the Latines in his <a id="l2537"></a>mystical body, they being the waters which he cast out of <a id="l2538"></a>his mouth as a flood after the woman at the division of <a id="l2539"></a>the Empire between the sons of Constantine the great. <a id="l2540"></a>Then the Earth opened her mouth &amp; swallowed up the waters <a id="l2541"></a>by a reunion of the two Empires at the conquest of Mag<a id="l2542"></a>nentius by Constantius. By that conquest the Beast was <a id="l2543"></a>wounded to death by a sword. He revived  by a new divi<a id="l2544"></a>sion at the death of Iovian, &amp; rose out of the sea at the <a id="l2545"></a>division of the Empire between Gratian &amp; Theodosius, &amp; the <a id="l2546"></a>Dragon gave him his western throne  &amp; power &amp; great <a id="l2547"></a>authority  at the death of Theodosius by a division of <a id="l2548"></a>the Empire between his sons. And then by a further divi<a id="l2549"></a>sion of the western Empire into ten kingdoms the ten horns <a id="l2550"></a>received power as kings the same hour with the Beast. <a id="l2551"></a>Before this division of the Empire the horns were on the <a id="l2552"></a>Dragons head, but without crowns.  After this division they re<a id="l2553"></a>ceived power as kings &amp; therefore are crowned only on <a id="l2554"></a>the head of the Beast. The seven heads are successive <a id="l2555"></a>as may be gathered from the saying: Five are fallen &amp; one <a id="l2556"></a>is &amp; another is not yet come, &amp; when he cometh he must <a id="l2557"></a>continue a short space; And the Beast which was &amp; is not <a id="l2558"></a>(being wounded to death with sword in his sixt head) he <a id="l2559"></a>is the eighth &amp; is of the seven. I take these seven heads <a id="l2560"></a>to be seven successive reigns of the Roman Empire commencing <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p045r"> &lt;45r&gt; </span> at the opening of the seven seales. They are all crowned <a id="l2561"></a>on the Dragon but not on the Beast because six of them <a id="l2562"></a>reigned before the division of the Roman Empire into <a id="l2563"></a>the Greek &amp; Latin Empires; &amp; the Greek Empire was <a id="l2564"></a>the seventh, &amp; the Latin Empire was the eighth &amp; of <a id="l2565"></a>the seven because contemporary to the seventh as a <a id="l2566"></a>collateral part thereof.</p>
            <p id="par155">The Woman who appeared in heaven cloathed with the <a id="l2567"></a>sun &amp; crowned with twelve stars whose seed keep the command<a id="l2568"></a>ments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus, represents the <a id="l2569"></a>primitive Church of Christ within the whole Roman Empire <a id="l2570"></a>untill it became divided into the Greek &amp; Latin Empires. Then <a id="l2571"></a>she fled from the Dragon into the Latin Empire &amp; sat upon <a id="l2572"></a>the ten-horned Beast, &amp; left the Greek Empire to the <a id="l2573"></a>other Beast which then rose out of the earth with two horns <a id="l2574"></a>like the Lamb  that is ecclesiasticall <a id="l2575"></a>ones, &amp; is called the fals Prophet &amp; in matters of religion it spoke as the Dragon &amp; <a id="l2576"></a>therefore was his church. And since it rose out of the earth <a id="l2577"></a>its two horns at its first rise were the Churches of Alex<a id="l2578"></a>andria &amp;  Antioch. And when the woman fled from <a id="l2579"></a>the Dragon  he went to make war with the <a id="l2580"></a>remnant of her seed which kept the commandments of God <a id="l2581"></a>&amp; had the testimony of Iesus. And from them proceeded <a id="l2582"></a>the two Witnesses.</p>
            <p id="par156">In this Prophesy allusion is had to the worship of <a id="l2583"></a>God in the Temple of Ierusalem in the feast of the <a id="l2584"></a>seventh month.  The first Temple is alluded <a id="l2585"></a>unto in describing the times of the primitive Church: the <a id="l2586"></a>second is alluded unto in describing the times which followed <a id="l2587"></a>the  captivity of that church by the Babylonians who worshipped Mahuzzims. The first Temple had an Ark &amp; an out<a id="l2588"></a>ward court, the second had none. The first in the prophesy had seven <a id="l2589"></a>golden candlesticks, the second had only two. The  first Temple  <a id="l2590"></a>stands till the opening of the seventh seale, the building of <a id="l2591"></a>the building of <a id="l2592"></a>the second is represented by Iohn's measuring the Temple <a id="l2593"></a>&amp; Altar &amp; them that worship therein (that is, their Courts) <a id="l2594"></a>&amp; leaving the Court without the Temple unmeasured. And <a id="l2595"></a>this Temple is afterwards called the Temple of the Ta<a id="l2596"></a>bernacle because the Tabernacle had no outward Court.</p>
            <p id="par157">In the beginning of the Prophesy in allusion to the <a id="l2597"></a>High Priest's dressing the lamps in the morning of a festival <a id="l2598"></a>Christ  walked in the habit of the High Priest  <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>close<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l2599"></a>behind the seven gold candles with his right hand behind their <a id="l2600"></a>lamps, so that they appeared to Iohn as if he walked in <a id="l2601"></a>in the midst of the candlesticks &amp; held a rod of seven stars <a id="l2602"></a>in his right hand, &amp; Iohn is there told that the seven stars <a id="l2603"></a>are the Angels of the seven Churches of Asia, that is <a id="l2604"></a>their Bishops, &amp; that the seven Candlesticks are the seven <a id="l2605"></a>Churches. And these Lamps he dresses by directing Iohn to <a id="l2606"></a>send seven admonitory Epistles to the  seven Angels of <a id="l2607"></a>the seven Churches. And since these Candlesticks with their Lamps were in the <a id="l2608"></a>first Temple, it signifies that the primitive Church was represented &amp; <a id="l2609"></a>illuminated by the seven Churches of Asia during all the times of <a id="l2610"></a>the first Temple.</p>
            <p id="par158">After the Lamps were dressed the celebration of the morning <a id="l2611"></a>sacrifice is alluded unto in the following manner. Iohn saw a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p046r"> &lt;46r&gt; </span> door opened in heaven, the door of the Temple on mount Sion <a id="l2612"></a>&amp; was called up thither, that is to the eastern gate of the <a id="l2613"></a>great court to see all things from thence. And a throne was <a id="l2614"></a>set in heaven, the throne of God upon the Ark between the <a id="l2615"></a>Cherubims. And one sat on the throne in a glorious appearance <a id="l2616"></a>with a rainbow about him. And about the Throne appeared <a id="l2617"></a>twenty four seats, the chambers of the twenty four Princes <a id="l2618"></a>of the Priests, &amp; upon the seats twenty four Elders sitting <a id="l2619"></a>in white raiment with crowns of gold on their heads. <a id="l2620"></a>And by reason of the sacrifices on the altar &amp; the Levites <a id="l2621"></a>singing at the eastern gate of the Priests court, there seemed <a id="l2622"></a>to Iohn to proceed out of the throne, lightnings &amp;  thun<a id="l2623"></a>derings &amp; voices. And there were seven lamps of fire <a id="l2624"></a>burning before the throne, the lamps newly dressed, which <a id="l2625"></a>are the seven spirits of God. And before the throne was <a id="l2626"></a>a sea of glass like unto crystall, the great bazen sea <a id="l2627"></a> polished like a lookingglasses  &amp; filled <a id="l2628"></a>with water clear as crystal. And in the midst of the <a id="l2629"></a>throne that is before &amp; behind as it were in the midst of it, &amp;  in the circuit of the <a id="l2630"></a>throne that is on either side, were four Beasts full of <a id="l2631"></a>eyes before &amp; behind. By the multitudes of their eyes they repre<a id="l2632"></a>sent multitudes of people, the multitudes of the people of <a id="l2633"></a>Israel  in the four sides of the great Court or Court of <a id="l2634"></a>the people. And the first Beast was like a Lion &amp; the <a id="l2635"></a>second Beast like a Calf &amp; the third Beast had the face <a id="l2636"></a>of a man, &amp; the fourth Beast was like a flying Eagle. <a id="l2637"></a>For  in these shapes were the four standards of <a id="l2638"></a>the four squadrons of the children of Israel encamp<a id="l2639"></a>ed on the four sides of the Tabernacle in the wilder<a id="l2640"></a>ness. And each of them had six wings, in allusion to the <a id="l2641"></a>Seraphims about the throne in Isaiah's vision. ch. 6. 2. And these wings represent the 24 courses of the stationary men  chosen out of all Israel. <a id="l2642"></a>And they rest not day &amp; night, or at the morning &amp; even<a id="l2643"></a>ing sacrifices, saying Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, <a id="l2644"></a>which was &amp; is &amp; is to come. And when those Beasts, (that <a id="l2645"></a>is the people of Israel represented by them) give glory <a id="l2646"></a>&amp; honour &amp; thanks to him that sat on the throne, who <a id="l2647"></a>liveth for ever &amp; ever; the four &amp; twenty Elders (going into the holy place) fall down <a id="l2648"></a>before him that sat on the throne &amp; worship him that liveth <a id="l2649"></a>for ever &amp; ever, &amp; cast their crowns before the throne saying <a id="l2650"></a>Thou art worthy, ô Lord to receive glory &amp; honour &amp; power: <a id="l2651"></a>for thou hast created all things &amp; for thy pleasure they <a id="l2652"></a>are &amp; were created. And this is the worship which the <a id="l2653"></a>primitive Christians gave to God the father while they con<a id="l2654"></a>tinued to worship in the first Temple.</p>
            <p id="par159">And Iohn saw in the right hand of him that sat on <a id="l2655"></a>the throne a book written within &amp; on the backside sealed <a id="l2656"></a>with seven seales : the Book of the law laid up in the right <a id="l2657"></a>side of the Ark, as it were in the right hand of him that sitteth <a id="l2658"></a>on the throne; the book of Prophesy which Daniel was com<a id="l2659"></a>manded to seale up; the Book of the revelation of Iesus <a id="l2660"></a>Christ which God gave unto him. And none was found worthy <a id="l2661"></a>to open &amp; read the book or look thereon till the Lamb  <a id="l2662"></a>appeared  before the midst of the <a id="l2663"></a>throne &amp; in the midst of the  four Beasts &amp; of the <a id="l2664"></a>elders, as it had been slain at the foot of the Altar, having <a id="l2665"></a>seven horns &amp; seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God <a id="l2666"></a>sent forth into all the earth, &amp; signify the same thing with <a id="l2667"></a>the seven lamps &amp; seven stars, &amp; the seven horns signify the <a id="l2668"></a>same thing with the seven Candlesticks. And the Lamb came <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p047r"> &lt;47r&gt; </span> &amp; took the book out of the right hand of him that sitteth upon the throne <a id="l2669"></a>And when he had taken the book the four Beasts &amp; four &amp; twenty <a id="l2670"></a>Elders fell down before the Lamb having every one of them harps <a id="l2671"></a>&amp; golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints <a id="l2672"></a>And they sung a new song saying Thou art worthy to take the <a id="l2673"></a>Book &amp; to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain &amp; hast re<a id="l2674"></a>deemed us to god  by thy blood out of every <a id="l2675"></a>kindred &amp; tongue &amp; people &amp; nation; &amp; hast made us unto our <a id="l2676"></a>God kings &amp; priests &amp; we shall reign on the earth.  And <a id="l2677"></a>Iohn heard the voice of many Angels round about the throne <a id="l2678"></a>&amp; the Beasts &amp; the Elders, &amp; the number of them was ten thou<a id="l2679"></a>sand times ten thousand &amp; thousands &amp; thousands, saying with <a id="l2680"></a>a loud voice: worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power <a id="l2681"></a>&amp; riches &amp; wisdome &amp; strength &amp; honour &amp; glory &amp; blessing. <a id="l2682"></a>And every creature which is in heaven &amp; on the earth &amp; under <a id="l2683"></a>the earth &amp; such as are in the sea &amp; all that are in them Iohn <a id="l2684"></a>heard saying, Blessing &amp; honour &amp; glory &amp; power, be unto him that <a id="l2685"></a>sitteth upon the throne &amp; unto the Lamb for ever &amp; ever; unto <a id="l2686"></a>the one because he sitteth upon the throne &amp; hath created <a id="l2687"></a>all things, &amp; unto the other because he is the Lamb of God which <a id="l2688"></a>was slain &amp; hath redeemed us with his blood. And the four <a id="l2689"></a>Beasts said Amen. And the four &amp; twenty Elders fell down (in <a id="l2690"></a>the Holy place) &amp; worshipped him that (cannot be slain but) <a id="l2691"></a>liveth for ever and ever.

And when he had opened the seventh seal there <a id="l2700"></a>was silence in the Temple of heaven for half an hour, the <a id="l2701"></a>people praying silently without in the time of incense Luke 1. <a id="l2702"></a>10. And an Angel representing the High Priest, came &amp; stood <a id="l2703"></a>at a great Altar having a golden Censer to take fire <a id="l2704"></a>from thence. And there was given him much Incense that he <a id="l2705"></a>should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden <a id="l2706"></a>Altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the <a id="l2707"></a>Incense with the prayers of the saints ascended up also <a id="l2708"></a>before God out of the Angels hand, that is, when he went into <a id="l2709"></a>the most holy place &amp; put incense  on the censer. And <a id="l2710"></a>after this the Angel took the censer &amp; filled it with  <a id="l2711"></a>fire of the Altar &amp; cast it  upon the earth without the sanctuary <a id="l2712"></a>for burning the Bullock &amp; Goat for the sin offering Levit. 16. 12, <a id="l2713"></a>13, 27. And there were voices &amp; thundrings &amp; lightnings &amp; <a id="l2714"></a>an earthquake the voices &amp; thundrings alluding to the singing of the Levites at the <a id="l2715"></a>sacrifices, &amp; the lightnings to the flaming of the fire.</p>
            <p id="par161">The day of Expiation was followed by the feast of the <a id="l2716"></a>seventh month, which began on the fifteenth day of the month <a id="l2717"></a>&amp; was kept seven days together with great sacrifices, at which <a id="l2718"></a>the Priests sounded their Trumpets &amp; the Levites sang with loud <a id="l2719"></a>voices &amp; played upon musical instruments. And in allusion to <a id="l2720"></a>this, seven Angels sound their trumpets &amp; seven Thunders <a id="l2721"></a>utter their voices at seven great warrs considered as sacrifices</p>
            <p id="par162">But it is to be observed that the times between the opening <a id="l2722"></a>of the seventh seal &amp; the sounding of the seventh Trumpet are <a id="l2723"></a>described four times. First by the sealing 144000 of of all the <a id="l2724"></a>Tribes of Israel &amp; by the Palmbearing multitude. Secondly by <a id="l2725"></a>the incense &amp; the sounding of six of the Trumpets. Thirdly by the seven <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p048r"> &lt;48r&gt; </span> Thunders uttering their voices &amp; by a declaration that when the <a id="l2726"></a>seventh Trumpet should begin to sound the mystery of God should be <a id="l2727"></a>finished. And fourthly by measuring the Temple &amp; Altar &amp; <a id="l2728"></a>them that dwell therein.</p>
            <p id="par163">The first beginns with the words: And after these things, <a id="l2729"></a>(that is after the visions of the first six seals,) I saw four <a id="l2730"></a>Angels stand on the four corners of the earth, holding the four <a id="l2731"></a>winds that they should not blow on the earth nor on the sea <a id="l2732"></a>nor on any tree.  And they were commanded that they should not <a id="l2734"></a>hurt the earth &amp; the sea &amp; the trees till the servants of God <a id="l2735"></a>were sealed in their foreheads. They were therefore the <a id="l2736"></a>Angels of the first four Trumpets which preceded the Wo-trum<a id="l2737"></a>pets. And this sealing was perfomed when the Angels of the <a id="l2738"></a>Trumpets upon opening of the seventh seale appeared with <a id="l2739"></a>their Trumpets &amp; stood ready to sound so soon as the servants <a id="l2740"></a>of God should be sealed</p>
            <p id="par164">The sealing of the 144000 out of  the twelve Tribes of Isra<a id="l2741"></a>el &amp; leaving all the rest unsealed signifies the same thing <a id="l2742"></a>with measuring the Temple &amp; Altar &amp; them that worship <a id="l2743"></a>therein &amp; leaving out the  <a id="l2744"></a>Court which is without the Temple. And therefore these two vi<a id="l2745"></a>sions are synchronal &amp; commence at the same time with the <a id="l2746"></a>opening of the seventh Seal. The Trumpets &amp; Thunders are <a id="l2747"></a>synchronal because they accompany the same sacrifices.</p>
            <p id="par165">The measuring of the Temple &amp; Altar &amp; them that <a id="l2748"></a>worship therein (that is the Court of the Temple &amp; Court of <a id="l2749"></a>the Altar &amp; Court of them that worship therein called <a id="l2750"></a>the weomen's Court) &amp; leaving the outward Court unmeasured <a id="l2751"></a>signifies the building of a new Temple without an out<a id="l2752"></a>ward Court. And therefore the times of the second Temple <a id="l2753"></a>begin with the opening of the seventh seal.  In this <a id="l2754"></a>Temple were only two Candlesticks standing before the <a id="l2755"></a>God of the earth, &amp; these were supplied with oyle by two <a id="l2756"></a>olive trees &amp; are called the two witnesses. In the first <a id="l2757"></a>Temple were seven golden Candlesticks representing the <a id="l2758"></a>seven churches of Asia.  <a id="l2759"></a>Five of these in the Epistles to the seven Churches were <a id="l2760"></a>found fault with &amp; exhorted to repent. These were laid <a id="l2761"></a>aside when the times of the first Temple expired, &amp; only the other two  which were blameless &amp; in a state of <a id="l2763"></a>affliction persecution &amp; poverty were propagated down <a id="l2764"></a>into the second Temple. For the Church which worshipped <a id="l2765"></a>in the second Temple was not a new Church but was <a id="l2766"></a>propagated down from the Church which worshipped in the <a id="l2767"></a>first Temple.</p>
            <p id="par166">After these things the seventh Angel sounded, &amp; the <a id="l2768"></a>time of the dead came that they should be judged. And <a id="l2769"></a>thus ended the prophesy of the Seales &amp; Trumpets. <a id="l2770"></a>But as in Daniel every Vision is followed with <a id="l2771"></a>an Interpretation: so here in Iohn this vision of the <a id="l2772"></a>seals &amp; Trumpets is followed with an Interpretation <a id="l2773"></a>&amp; the Interpretation begins with these words.</p>
            <p id="par167">And the Temple of God was opened in heaven, &amp; <a id="l2774"></a>there was seen in his Temple the Ark of his Testament. <a id="l2775"></a>By the Ark you may know that this was the first <a id="l2776"></a>Temple. In this Temple the actions between the primitive <a id="l2777"></a>Church represented by a Woman &amp; the heathen Roman Em<a id="l2778"></a>pire represented by a Dragon are described untill the Empire <a id="l2779"></a>becomes divided, &amp; a ten horned Beast rises out of the Sea to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p049r"> &lt;49r&gt; </span> represent the western Empire &amp; a two horned Beast out of <a id="l2780"></a>the earth to represent the Eastern Church, &amp; all men <a id="l2781"></a>are killed who will not worship the image of the Beast. This mystical <a id="l2782"></a>killing puts an end to the times of the first Temple &amp; begins the times <a id="l2783"></a>of the second. Then all men receive the mark or name of <a id="l2784"></a>the Beast except the 144000, who are sealed at the same <a id="l2785"></a>time with the name of God in their foreheads, &amp; then stand <a id="l2786"></a>(in the Temple) on mount Sion with the Lamb. Then follows the preaching <a id="l2787"></a>of the Gospel to all nations by the Palm-bearing multitude, <a id="l2788"></a>&amp; the double fall of Babylon, &amp; the harvest &amp; vintage or <a id="l2789"></a>first &amp; second resurrection successively.</p>
            <p id="par168">Then the Prophet returns back to the time of opening <a id="l2790"></a>the seventh Seal, &amp; sees those that get the victory over <a id="l2791"></a>the Beast &amp; his Image &amp; mark standing on the sea of <a id="l2792"></a>glass, that is, the 144000 who stood on mount Sion with <a id="l2793"></a>the Lamb &amp; who were sealed out of all the twelve tribes of <a id="l2794"></a>Israel. <span class="ns">☉</span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 48v &gt; </span><span class="ns">☉</span> These standing  in the Court of the weomen &amp;  at the eastern gate of the Priests Court appear <a id="l2796"></a>to Iohn as if they stood on the sea of glass.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 49r resumes &gt; </span> These are they who worshipped in the second <a id="l2797"></a>Temple &amp; were measured therein &amp;  called <a id="l2798"></a>the two Candlesticks &amp; the two witnesses.

And this <a id="l2803"></a>was in the Temple of the Tabernacle, or Temple which <a id="l2804"></a>wanted an outward Court.</p>
                    <p id="par169">Then the Prophet returns back to the time of the <a id="l2805"></a>sixt seal when five of the heads of the Beast were fallen <a id="l2806"></a>&amp; the sixt was, &amp; describes the reign of the Woman <a id="l2807"></a>upon her Beast untill the double fall of Babylon; &amp; <a id="l2808"></a>then goes on to the resurrection of the just called the <a id="l2809"></a>first resurrection &amp; represented before by the harvest, <a id="l2810"></a>&amp; farther unto the general resurrection represented <a id="l2811"></a>before by the vintage, &amp; unto the reign of the saints in the <a id="l2812"></a>New Ierusalem.</p>

            <p id="par170">1.

To these three parts the phrases of the third part of the <a id="l2823"></a>sun, Moon, stars, earth, seas, rivers, trees &amp; ships relate. The second &amp; third are in this Prophesy represented by the Earth &amp; Sea. For by the Earth the Iews understood the great continent of Asia &amp; Afric to which they had access by land &amp; called those places  to which they had access by sea &amp; particularly Europe the isles of the sea.</p>

            <p id="par172">3. The Dragon  reigned alone untill the  Roman Empire <a id="l2830"></a>became divided into the Greek &amp; Latine Empires. Before that division <a id="l2831"></a>the Dragon included the nations of the Latines in his mysti<a id="l2832"></a>cal body, they being the waters which he cast out of his <a id="l2833"></a>mouth as a flood after the woman. Then the earth opened her <a id="l2834"></a>mouth &amp; swallowed up the waters by a reunion of the <a id="l2835"></a>two Empires at the conquest of Magnentius by Constantius. <a id="l2836"></a>By that conquest the Beast was wounded to death by a <a id="l2837"></a>sword. He revived by a new division at the death of <a id="l2838"></a>Iovian &amp; rose out of the sea at the  division of <a id="l2839"></a>the Empire between Gratian &amp; Theodosius &amp; the Dragon <a id="l2840"></a>gave him his western throne &amp; power &amp; great authority <a id="l2841"></a>at the death of Theodosius by the division of the empire <a id="l2842"></a>between his sons. And then by a further division of the western <a id="l2843"></a>empire into ten kingdoms the ten horns received power <a id="l2844"></a>as kings the same hour with the Beast. Before this <a id="l2845"></a>division of the Empire the horns were on the Dragons head <a id="l2846"></a>but without crowns. Presently after the division they re<a id="l2847"></a>ceived power as kings &amp; therefore are crowned only on the last <a id="l2848"></a>head of the Beast.

I take these seven <a id="l2852"></a>heads to be seven successive reigns of the Roman Empire commencing <a id="l2853"></a>at the opening of the seven seals. They are all crowned on the Dragon <a id="l2854"></a>but not on the Beast because six of them reigned before the division <a id="l2855"></a>of the  Roman Empire into the Greek &amp; Latin Empires, &amp; the  the Greek Empire was the seventh &amp; the Latin Empire was the eighth, &amp; of the seven <a id="l2857"></a>because contemporary to the seventh as a collateral part thereof. <a id="l2858"></a>4  When the Temple of God was opened in heaven &amp; there <a id="l2859"></a>was seen in his Temple the Ark of his testament, this is to be understood of the <a id="l2860"></a>first Temple, for the second Temple had no Ark.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 50r resumes &gt; </span></p>

The Vision <a id="l2906"></a>ends with the sounding of the seventh Trumpet &amp; the time of the dead that <a id="l2907"></a>they should be judged, &amp; the Interpretation beginns with the words <em class="underline">And the <a id="l2908"></a>Temple of God was opened in heaven &amp; there was seen in his Temple the Ark <a id="l2909"></a>of his Testament,</em> &amp; continues to teh end of the Prophesy.</p>
            <p id="par175">4. The whole time of the prophesy is distinguished into two parts, the first part is of <a id="l2910"></a>the primitive Church in the first Temple during the opening of the seales, the second <a id="l2911"></a>part is of the remnant of her seed in the second Temple during the sounding <a id="l2912"></a>of the Trumpets. The two Temples are distinguished from one another by <a id="l2913"></a>the Ark &amp; by the outward Court. For the second Temple had no  Arc <a id="l2914"></a>nor outward Court. In the Vision When Iohn saw a door opened in heaven &amp; being called <a id="l2915"></a>up saw through the door a throne set in heaven &amp; one sitting thereon &amp; seven lamps &amp; a sea of o: this <a id="l2916"></a>throne is the Arc &amp; therefore the door was in first Temple.

And in the Interpretation when  the Temple of God was opened in heaven &amp; there was seen in his <a id="l2922"></a>Temple the ARk of his testament: this  was the first <a id="l2923"></a>Temple because the second had no Ark. &amp; when the Temple of the Taberna<a id="l2924"></a>cle of the Testimony in heaven was opened, this was the second Tem<a id="l2925"></a>ple because the Tabernacle had no outward court.</p>
            <p id="par176">5 When the door of the first Temple or Temple of the primitive Church was first <a id="l2926"></a>opened, the worship of that Church is thus described.

            <p id="par183">10 The woman which upon opening the first Temple appeared in heaven  cloathed with the <a id="l2939"></a>sun &amp; crowned with 12 starrs whose seed keep the commandments of God &amp; have <a id="l2940"></a>the testimony of Iesus, represents the primitive Church of Christ within the <a id="l2941"></a>whole Roman Empire represented by the Dragon untill she flyes from the <a id="l2942"></a>face of the  Dragon &amp; he goes from her to make war with the remnant of <a id="l2943"></a>her seed. At that time  by the division of the Roman Empire into the <a id="l2944"></a>Greek &amp; Latin Empires, the  Woman flys from him into the Latin Empire &amp; <a id="l2945"></a>the Dragon  goes from her into the Empire of the Greeks &amp; gives his western throne <a id="l2946"></a>to the Beast which then rises out of the sea or isles of the sea. And at the <a id="l2947"></a>same time another Beast rises out of the earth or nations of the Greek Empire <a id="l2948"></a>with two horns like the horns of the Lamb or two original Churches like the <a id="l2949"></a>seven Churches of Asia in outward appearance or form of government. These <a id="l2950"></a>I take to be the churches of Alexandria &amp; Antioch, that of  Constan<a id="l2951"></a>tinople  not being made a Patriarchal till after the rise of this Beast. And this <a id="l2952"></a>Beast spoke as the Dragon, that is in matters of religion &amp; so  was his Church <a id="l2953"></a>while the Woman sat upon the ten-horned Beast as his Church. For the two horned Beast is called a fals Prophet &amp; so was of an Ecclesiastical kind. And thus <a id="l2954"></a>the Roman Empire became divided into two Empires  represented by the <a id="l2955"></a>Dragon &amp; the Beast with ten horns, each with his own Church represented by the two horned <a id="l2956"></a>Beast &amp; woman. And while the Dragon made war with the remnant of her seed <a id="l2957"></a>which kept the commandments of God, the two horned Beast causeth <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p051r-b"> &lt;51r&gt; </span> them that dwell on the earth  or nations of the Greek Empire <a id="l2958"></a>to worship the first Beast, that is to receive his religion, &amp; that  <a id="l2959"></a>they should erect an Image or Council to set it up, &amp; all both small <a id="l2960"></a>&amp; great  rich &amp; poor free &amp; bond should receive a mark in their <a id="l2961"></a>right hand or in their forehead. And that no man might buy or sell <a id="l2962"></a>save he that had the mark or name of the Beast or the number of his name, all <a id="l2963"></a>the rest being excommunicated. And while this is doing the rest to <a id="l2964"></a>the number of 144000 receive the name of God in their foreheads <a id="l2965"></a>&amp; then stand on mount Sion with the Lamb. Thus the first Temple <a id="l2966"></a>is thrown down by excommunicating the worshippers &amp; a second Temple is built for the worship of the 144000. <a id="l2967"></a></p>
            <p id="par184">These that in this conflict get the victory over the Beast &amp; <a id="l2968"></a>over his Image &amp; over his mark &amp; over the number of his name, <a id="l2969"></a> stand on the sea of glass  having the harps <a id="l2970"></a>of God &amp; they sing the song of Moses for their dliverance from the <a id="l2971"></a>bondage of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom &amp; Egypt <a id="l2972"></a>&amp; the song of Lamb with the 144000 on mount Sion. And this is done <a id="l2973"></a>just before the pouring out of the seven Vials of wrath, &amp; by con<a id="l2974"></a>sequence just before the sounding of the seven Trumpets. And therefore <a id="l2975"></a>these Victors are the very same with the 144000 sealed in their <a id="l2976"></a>foreheads  after the opening of the sixt seal &amp; before the hurting <a id="l2977"></a>of the earth &amp; sea &amp; trees at the sounding of the  Trumpets. This <a id="l2978"></a>sealing &amp; numbring signifyes the same thing with the measuring <a id="l2979"></a>of the Temple &amp; Altar &amp; them that worship therein, that is, their <a id="l2980"></a>Courts. And this measuring signifies the building of a second Tem<a id="l2981"></a>ple. And they that worship therein are the two Witnesses,  <a id="l2982"></a>for in allusion to Zacharys vision of a Candlestick with seven lamps in the second Temple &amp; <a id="l2983"></a>two olive trees supplying it with oyle: these Witnesses are called <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p050v"> &lt;50v&gt; </span> = two Candlesticks that is Churches  (Apoc. 1. 20) &amp; two Olive trees, (that is also Churches <a id="l2984"></a>Rom. 11. 17, 24) The two Witnesses are therefore the Churches which worship in the second <a id="l2985"></a>temple, the 144000 who were sealed out of the twelve Tribes of Israel, &amp; <a id="l2986"></a>stand on mount Zion with the Lamb &amp; on the sea of glass in the second Temple <a id="l2987"></a>built on mount Zion: There are those that were sealed out of the remnant of the womans <a id="l2988"></a>seed  when the Dragon made war upon them &amp; the two-horned Beast <a id="l2989"></a>caused all to be killed who would not worship the ten horned Beast &amp; his image <a id="l2990"></a>&amp; thereby put an end to the first Temple.</p>

            <p id="par186">When the Temple was opened in heaven for Iohn to see <a id="l2997"></a>the visions in it, he saw there the Ark of the Testament &amp; the <a id="l2998"></a>child-bearing woman &amp; the Dragon standing by her, &amp; how her <a id="l2999"></a>child was caught up to the throne of God above the Ark, &amp; the <a id="l3000"></a>Dragon was cast out of this Temple of heaven by Michael <a id="l3001"></a>into the outward court or court of the people, which people are <a id="l3002"></a>here called the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea, &amp; how the Woman <a id="l3003"></a>fled from this Temple through the wilderness of Arabia to serve <a id="l3004"></a>other Gods wood &amp; stone, &amp; became seated in the great city Babylon which <a id="l3005"></a>reigneth over the kings of the earth, &amp; left a remnant of her seed <a id="l3006"></a>with the Dragon in the outward court of the Temple. There he <a id="l3007"></a>saw the two Beasts rise out of the sea &amp; earth &amp; the second Beast <a id="l3008"></a>deify the first &amp; cause me to erect an Image to him &amp; to worship <a id="l3009"></a>the Image. There the Dragon by the dictates of the speaking Image <a id="l3010"></a>(before he gave his throne to the Beast) made war upon the <a id="l3011"></a>remnant of the Womans seed &amp; mystically killed at that would <a id="l3012"></a>not worship the Image: &amp; there all men received the mark or name <a id="l3013"></a>of the Beast or number of his name except the 144000 who <a id="l3014"></a>were sealed with the name of God &amp; being forbid to buy &amp; sell <a id="l3015"></a>&amp; by consequence interdicted society by excommunication, retire from the <a id="l3016"></a>multitude in the outward court of the Temple, &amp; stand on mount Sion <a id="l3017"></a>with the Lamb singing a new song before the throne &amp; the four beasts <a id="l3018"></a>&amp; the Elders &amp; by consequence in the  inner Court  at <a id="l3019"></a>the eastern border  therefore called the court of Israel. <a id="l3020"></a>For there the singing used to be performed. And when the Dragon had <a id="l3021"></a>expelled those that would not worship the Image of the Beast in the <a id="l3022"></a>outward Court he there gave the Beast his power &amp; his throne &amp; great <a id="l3023"></a>authority. And all the world wondred after the Beast, &amp; power was given <a id="l3024"></a>him over all kindreds &amp; tongues &amp; nations &amp; all that dwell upon the earth <a id="l3025"></a>worship him [&amp; his image] whose names are not written in the book of life</p>
            <p id="par187">In the beginning of the visions in the Temple which was opened <a id="l3026"></a>in heaven the Ark was seen in it &amp; therefore it was the Taberna<a id="l3027"></a>cle or first Temple or temple of the tabernacle as it is after<a id="l3028"></a>wards called.  Now they that worshipped in the tabernacle &amp; first <a id="l3029"></a>temple were the twelve tribes of Israel, &amp; the Woman which ap<a id="l3030"></a>peared in this temple had upon her head a crown of twelve stars <a id="l3031"></a>to represent these tribes, &amp; out of all these tribes the 144000 <a id="l3032"></a>were  numbered &amp; sealed, &amp; twelve tribes being all Israel <a id="l3033"></a>represent the Church catholick, &amp; this Church inhabited the earth <a id="l3034"></a>&amp; sea because the Angel which had the seal of God cryed with <a id="l3035"></a>a loud voice saying: Hurt not the earth &amp; sea till we have <a id="l3036"></a>sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. These tribes are <a id="l3037"></a>the inhabiters of the earth &amp; sea to whom the Dragon came down <a id="l3038"></a>from his heathen throne with great wrath; the earth &amp; sea upon which the son of man stood with the little book open in his hand, the earth out <a id="l3039"></a>of which the two-horned Beast arose &amp; the sea out of which the <a id="l3040"></a>ten-horned Beast arose, the first with horns like the Lamb, the second <a id="l3041"></a>subject to the woman. For then earth &amp; sea  with their inhabitants are <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p054r"> &lt;54r&gt; </span> the subject of this prophesy. / The Church catholick therefore by <a id="l3042"></a>the sealing of the 144000 out of the twelve tribes suffers a great <a id="l3043"></a>alteration &amp; becomes divided into two parties. The multitude <a id="l3044"></a>receive the mark  or name of the Beast or number of <a id="l3045"></a>his name &amp;  continue in the outward court of the <a id="l3046"></a>Temple where they used to worship, &amp; there worship the Beast <a id="l3047"></a>&amp; his image &amp; receive his mark; &amp; the 144000 are sealed with the name of God <a id="l3048"></a>&amp; being excommunicated by the multitude retire into the court <a id="l3049"></a>of Israel in the eastern border of the Priests court. The Beast was slain with a sword &amp; revived before he rose out of the sea with the wound healed in one of his heads . And  To worship the Beast <a id="l3050"></a>&amp; his Image is to deify him after his death &amp; resurrection, &amp; <a id="l3051"></a>to receive his mark or name or the number of his name <a id="l3052"></a>is to be initiated in this his worship as the heathens were initiated in the worship of their God by  being marked in the arm or ne<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>ct<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> with the mark or name or number of the name of those Gods. And  because <a id="l3053"></a>those that are initiated were of the twelve tribes of Israel, <a id="l3054"></a>by this initiation they  fall away  from the worship of God &amp; depart from the communion of his worshippers &amp; are initiated in the worship of the B. &amp; his Im. &amp;c. the synagogue of Satan who <a id="l3055"></a>say they are Iews &amp; are not &amp; in the worship of the Beast &amp; his image. And in like manner to be <a id="l3056"></a>sealed with the name of God &amp; Christ in their forehead <a id="l3057"></a>is to be initiated or at least confirmed in the Church of God &amp; Christ in a state of separation from those that receive the mark of the Beast.. By the apostasy <a id="l3058"></a>of the twelve Tribes to the worship of the Beast &amp; his Image &amp; the <a id="l3059"></a>  killing all those that would not worship the Image, the  mysticall body of the primitive Church of Christ was dissolved &amp; by the sealing of the <a id="l3060"></a>144000 with the name of God &amp; Christ in their foreheads a new Church or a <a id="l3061"></a>church in a new form was instituted, &amp; this is represented by measuring <a id="l3062"></a>the second Temple &amp; the Altar &amp; them [the 144000] that worship <a id="l3063"></a>therein &amp; by changing the form of the Candlesticks, &amp; by the  Lamb's chaning his shape  into that of the High Priest &amp; coming <a id="l3065"></a>down from heaven with the book open in his hand &amp; standing upon the <a id="l3066"></a>earth &amp; sea, &amp; by the dedication of a new temple signified by the <a id="l3067"></a>smoke with which the temple of the Tabernacle was filled from the glory of God, &amp; by the <a id="l3068"></a>Womans flying from the Temple into the Wilderness &amp; being succeeded in the Temple by <a id="l3069"></a>the two Witnesses, &amp; in S<sup>t</sup> Pauls Epistles by the revelation of the Man of Sin. Before the sealing of the twelve Tribes the Church <a id="l3070"></a>catholick including the Woman was represented by one golden candletick with seven branches <a id="l3071"></a>called the seven golden candlesticks, but upon that sealing the Can<a id="l3072"></a>dlestick  ceases to represent the Woman &amp; is therefore changed &amp; two candlesticks  <a id="l3073"></a>of olive tree are put to represent the 144000 along. For then the Empire <a id="l3074"></a>becomes divided into two Empires represented by the Dragon &amp; Beast, <a id="l3075"></a>&amp; the Church becomes divided accordingly into two churches seated <a id="l3076"></a>in the two empires &amp; is thenceforward represented by two candlesticks <a id="l3077"></a>&amp; called two witnesses or martyrs as above. For when the Image <a id="l3078"></a>spoke as an Oracle &amp; caused all that would not worship it to be <a id="l3079"></a>killed, then the 144000 were killed; not litterally, but by dissolving <a id="l3080"></a>their bodies ecclesiastick, abrogating their outward form of government <a id="l3081"></a>taking away their daily worship, &amp; expelling them the outward court of the temple:  &amp; being <a id="l3082"></a>killed for not worshipping the Image, they became  in a particular manner the two martyrs <a id="l3083"></a>or Witnesses of Iesus. The two wings of a great Eagle which were <a id="l3084"></a>given to the Woman are the Greek &amp; Latin churches, &amp; these Churches <a id="l3085"></a>are the twelve tribes of Israel. When the two Beasts arose, one <a id="l3086"></a>out of the  sea, the other out of the earth, then did these churches <a id="l3087"></a>receive the mark of the Beast, except the 144000, who being the <a id="l3088"></a>remnant of the two wings of the woman are still considered as two churches <a id="l3089"></a>&amp; accordingly represented by two candlesticks &amp; for their sufferings &amp; <a id="l3090"></a>testimony against the Dragon &amp; the worshippers of the Beast are called the two witnesses <a id="l3091"></a>&amp; the multitude of those signified by the two wings, by apostatizing &amp; committing fornication with the Whore &amp; receiving the mark <a id="l3092"></a>of the Beast become two fals churches represented by the whore of Ba<a id="l3093"></a>bylon &amp; the two horned Beast, &amp; these are the churches of the two Empires <a id="l3094"></a>represented by the first Beast &amp; the Dragon. For when the first Beast <a id="l3095"></a>rises out of the sea, the Empire becomes divided between him &amp; the Dragon, <a id="l3096"></a>&amp; the Church becomes divided into the Churches of the two Empires, the wor<a id="l3097"></a>shippers of the Beast into two fals Churches, &amp; the worshippers of God into <a id="l3098"></a>two true ones. For all kingdoms have their Churches.</p>
            <p id="par188">The Temple being the scene of the visions, I conceive that it remains the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p055r"> &lt;55r&gt; </span> same from the beginning to the end; &amp; that in allusion to the times <a id="l3099"></a>of the tabernacle or first temple or those of the second, for representing <a id="l3100"></a>the various states of the Church, the things which appear in the temple are <a id="l3101"></a>only changed. The Ark being the throne of God remains the same unless <a id="l3102"></a>perhaps in representing the second Temple which wanted it. The four Beasts <a id="l3103"></a>representing the Church catholick in all conditions, remains the same. In <a id="l3104"></a>allusion to the Babylonian captivity, to signify the like captivity of the <a id="l3105"></a>Christian Church the form of the Candlesticks is changed &amp; the eastern <a id="l3106"></a>border of the Priests court is made the court of Israel, &amp; the Woman <a id="l3107"></a>flyes into the wilderness &amp; becomes seated in the great city Babylon which reigns <a id="l3108"></a>over the kings of the earth, &amp; the Babylonian gentiles captivate the <a id="l3109"></a>people of God invade the outward court of the Temple, place the <a id="l3110"></a>abomination of desolation &amp; tread under foot the holy city &amp; sanctuary; <a id="l3111"></a>&amp; the people of God being forbidden to buy &amp; sell by those who say they <a id="l3112"></a>are Iews &amp; are not, that is, being excommunicated by the synagogue <a id="l3113"></a>of Satan &amp; expelled their society, retire into the court of Israel <a id="l3114"></a>in the eastern border of the Priests court &amp; there sing a new song <a id="l3115"></a>standing as it were on the sea of glass, or on the vessel made of <a id="l3116"></a>looking-glasses &amp; on the water therein, that is, on the earth &amp; sea. <a id="l3117"></a>For this was the earth &amp; sea  upon which the son of man stood in <a id="l3118"></a>the form of an Angel with the book open in his hand, &amp; they that <a id="l3119"></a>stand thereon as it were in flames of fire are the mystical body of the <a id="l3120"></a>Son of man who stands thereon with his leggs like pillars of fire <a id="l3121"></a>burning as it were in a furnace, &amp; his leggs by standing on this earth <a id="l3122"></a>&amp; sea denote the two churches called the two Witnesses. To signify <a id="l3123"></a>a new state of the Church they sing a new song at the dedi<a id="l3124"></a>cation of  a new Temple. For their song on mount <a id="l3125"></a>Sion is called a new one. Singing is prophesying &amp; therefore they are Prophets.. And while they stand singing on the <a id="l3126"></a>sea of glass seven Angels appear in the Temple with the seven <a id="l3127"></a>last plagues, &amp; upon their coming out of the Temple, one of the <a id="l3128"></a>four Beasts gives them seven Vials of wrath for the drink <a id="l3129"></a>offerings of the sacrifices, &amp; the Temple is filled with smoke <a id="l3130"></a>from the glory of God so that no man was able to enter into <a id="l3131"></a>the Temple as at the dedication of the Tabernacle &amp; Temple of Solomon. The four Beasts joyntly &amp; severally represent the <a id="l3132"></a>Church of God, &amp; so do the two Candlesticks; &amp; the seven Angels <a id="l3133"></a>are the Angels of the seven Churches &amp; are represented by the <a id="l3134"></a>seven lamps. And while the seven Angels have the seven last <a id="l3135"></a>plagues &amp; one of the four Beasts gives them seven Vials of <a id="l3136"></a>wrath, it signifies that the two Witnesses have power by the <a id="l3137"></a>hand of the seven Angels to smite the earth with all <a id="l3138"></a>plauges as often as they will. For the seven last plagues <a id="l3139"></a>are the plagues last mentioned in the prophesy &amp; those are the <a id="l3140"></a>plagues with which the two Witnesses had power to smite the earth.</p>
            <p id="par189">Dacia being conquered by Trajan became a part of the Roman <a id="l3141"></a>Empire, &amp; the Church of Dacia was subordinate to the Greek Church <a id="l3142"></a>&amp; sometimes sent her bishop to the Councils of the Greeks. Dacia <a id="l3143"></a>was also mixed with many Greeks carried captive from Thrace &amp; <a id="l3144"></a>Asia minor in the reign of Gallienus &amp; afterwards &amp; many fled <a id="l3145"></a>thither from the Greek Empire in time of  the tenth <a id="l3146"></a>persecution, &amp; from this country came the Goths &amp; Vandals who <a id="l3147"></a>invaded the western Empire, &amp; with their associates seating themselves in both Illyri<a id="l3148"></a>cum's, Noricum, Gallia, Spain, Italy &amp; Afric, made a mixture of the two <a id="l3149"></a>witnesses in those countries.</p>

            <p id="par191">Iohn tells us that before the Beast ascended out of the <a id="l3154"></a>abyss five of the kings represented by his heads, were fallen <a id="l3155"></a>&amp; the sixt was then in being. For before he ascended he <a id="l3156"></a>was latent in the Dragons mystical body &amp; therefore partakes <a id="l3157"></a>of all his heads. For he was the water which the Dragon cast <a id="l3158"></a>out of his mouth as a flood after the Woman to cause her <a id="l3159"></a>to be carried away of the flood. For waters are peoples &amp; <a id="l3160"></a>nations &amp; multitudes &amp; tongues, &amp; an aggregate of waters <a id="l3161"></a>as a stream a river a flood or a sea, is an aggregate of <a id="l3162"></a>men, a body politick or ecclesiastick, a kingdom or a church. <a id="l3163"></a>The waters which Christ spewed out of his mouth signify a body <a id="l3164"></a>ecclesiastick (the Church of Laodicea) first united to Christs mysti<a id="l3165"></a>cal body as a part thereof &amp; afterwards in a state of separa<a id="l3166"></a>tion or schism: &amp; in like manner the waters which the Dragon <a id="l3167"></a>casts out of his mouth must signify a body politick first united <a id="l3168"></a>to the Dragons body as a part thereof &amp; afterwards divided <a id="l3169"></a>from it. And the western Empire hath a particular relation <a id="l3170"></a>to the watry element. For the Beast rises out of the sea <a id="l3171"></a>&amp; the Woman sitts upon many waters: which waters sig<a id="l3172"></a>nify the peoples nations multitudes &amp; tongues over whom the <a id="l3173"></a>Woman reigneth &amp; which compose the horns &amp; body of the Beast <a id="l3174"></a>on whom she sitteth.

            <p id="par198">Iohn tells us that before the Beast  ascended out <a id="l3283"></a>of the abyss, five of the kings represented by his heads <a id="l3284"></a>were fallen &amp; the sixt was then in being. For before <a id="l3285"></a>he ascended he was latent in the Dragons mystical body <a id="l3286"></a>&amp; therefore partakes of all his heads. For he was the <a id="l3287"></a>water which the Dragon cast out of his mouth as a <a id="l3288"></a>flood after the Woman to cause her to be carried away of <a id="l3289"></a>the flood. For waters are peoples &amp; nations &amp; multitudes <a id="l3290"></a>&amp; tongues, &amp; an aggregate of waters, as a stream a river, a flood, <a id="l3291"></a>or a sea, is ‡ an aggregate of men <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 57v &gt; </span>‡is an aggregate of men a body politick or ecclesiastick a kingdom or a church. The waters which Christ <a id="l3292"></a>spewed out of his mouth signify a body ecclesiastick (the Church of Laodicea) <a id="l3293"></a>first united to Christs mystical body as a part thereof &amp; afterwards in a <a id="l3294"></a>state of separation or schism: &amp; in like manner the waters which the Dragon <a id="l3295"></a>casts out of his mouth must signify a body politick first united to the Dragons <a id="l3296"></a>body as a part thereof &amp; afterwards divided from it. And the western Empire <a id="l3297"></a>hath a particular relation to the watry element; For the beast rises out of the sea <a id="l3298"></a>&amp; the woman sitts upo many waters, which waters signify the peoples nations <a id="l3299"></a>multitudes &amp; tongues over whom the woman reigneth, &amp; which compose the body <a id="l3300"></a>&amp; horns of the Beast on which she sitteth. Her floating upon the flood &amp; sitting <a id="l3301"></a>upon many waters &amp; upon the Beast are types of one &amp; the same signification <a id="l3302"></a>&amp; represent her reigning over the flood in her way into the wilderness &amp; over <a id="l3303"></a>the many waters &amp; the Beast in the wilderness. She fled from the Dragon westward to reign at Rome <a id="l3304"></a>the seven hilled city the great city Babylon  &amp; therefore the <a id="l3305"></a>flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth after her is a western kingdom &amp; the <a id="l3306"></a>remaining body of the Dragon is an eastern. <a id="l3307"></a>And as the flowing of the flood out of the Dragons mouth signifies a division <a id="l3308"></a>of the Empire into two Empires one of which during the division is represented by the <a id="l3309"></a>Dragon &amp; the other by the flood, so the flying of the woman from the remnant of her <a id="l3310"></a>seed signifies the division of the Church into two Churches one of which is the Woman <a id="l3311"></a>the other the remnant of her seend.  <a id="l3314"></a>When she receives two wings of a great Eagle she becomes distinguished into two <a id="l3315"></a>churches in communion with one another. Upon these wings she flies into a  <a id="l3316"></a> spiritually barren kingdom represented by the wilderness. When she begins to fly <a id="l3317"></a>the Dragon casts out water as a flood after her that he might cause her to <a id="l3318"></a>be carried away of the flood, that is, that by the division of the Empire he might <a id="l3319"></a>promote the division of the Church &amp; cause the Woman to separate from the <a id="l3320"></a>remnant of her seed. The Earth helps her &amp; prevents the separation for a time <a id="l3321"></a>by swallowing up the waters: but at length she separates &amp; escapes into the wilderness   her by breach of communion.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p058v"> &lt;58v&gt; </span>  These <a id="l3326"></a>keep the commandments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus under the <a id="l3327"></a>persecuting Dragon while she flies into a state of spiritual barrenness &amp; <a id="l3328"></a>becomes the Whore of Babylon, &amp; makes her seat drunken with the blood of the martyrs of Iesus, &amp; therefore in flying she separates from the <a id="l3329"></a>communion  <a id="l3334"></a>of the remnant of her seed &amp; by separation  is spewed <a id="l3335"></a>out of Christs mouth.  For those of her communion worship the Beast <a id="l3337"></a>&amp; his Image &amp;  are d<sup>r</sup>unken with the wine of her fornication <a id="l3338"></a>&amp; are initiated  in her religion by receiving the mark  of the <a id="l3339"></a>Beast.  And the Dragon in making war upon the remnant <a id="l3340"></a>of her seed causeth all to be mystically killed that will not worship the Image of the <a id="l3341"></a>Beast, &amp; the other Beast with two horns causeth all to receive a mark &amp; that <a id="l3342"></a>no man may buy or sell save he that hath the mark or name of the Beast <a id="l3343"></a>or the number of his name: that is, he excommunicates all those who will <a id="l3344"></a>not forsake the communion of the remnant of the womans seed  , &amp; by a new initiation enter <a id="l3345"></a>into the communion of those  who worship the Beast &amp; his Image. <a id="l3346"></a>And at the end of this persecution there stand an hundred &amp; forty four <a id="l3347"></a>thousand with the Lamb on mount Sion sealed  with the seal of God out of all the twelve <a id="l3348"></a>tribes of Israel, the rest having received the mark of the Beast.

            <p id="par199">The occasion of this division was the building of <a id="l3365"></a>Constantinople by Constantine the great A. C. 330, &amp; endow<a id="l3366"></a>ing it with a Senate &amp; privileges like those at Rome, &amp; <a id="l3367"></a>making it the Metropolis of all the eastern part of the <a id="l3368"></a>Empire, as Rome had hitherto been of all the Empire, <a id="l3369"></a>&amp; was henceforward of all the western part thereof. <a id="l3370"></a>By this division of the Empire between two imperial <a id="l3371"></a>cities, the Woman received two wings of a great Eagle <a id="l3372"></a>that she might fly into the wilderness, &amp; at the death <a id="l3373"></a>of Constantine the great A. C. 337 the Dragon cast <a id="l3374"></a>out of his mouth water as a flood after the Woman <a id="l3375"></a>to cause her to be carried away of the flood. For the <a id="l3376"></a>Empire at that time became divided between the sons of <a id="l3377"></a>Constantine, his second son Constantius reigning over the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p059r"> &lt;59r&gt; </span> east, &amp; his other two sons Constantine &amp; Constans reigning in <a id="l3378"></a>the west. But Constantine was quickly slain &amp; then his Brother <a id="l3379"></a>Constans reigned over all the west, making Rome his imperial <a id="l3380"></a>seat as Constantinople was the imperial seat of Constantius. <a id="l3381"></a>And this division of the Empire tended to make the like division of <a id="l3382"></a>the Church. For the Bishop of Rome began now to claim the univer<a id="l3383"></a>sal Bishopric &amp; his claim was submitted unto by the western <a id="l3384"></a>Churches &amp; supported by the western Empire against the eastern <a id="l3385"></a>Churches &amp; almomst made a schism between them. For in the year <a id="l3386"></a>341 this Bishop began to receive appeals from the Councils of the <a id="l3387"></a>Greek church &amp; proudly summoned the bishops of that Church to <a id="l3388"></a>appear before him in a Council at Rome but was stoutly opposed <a id="l3389"></a>&amp; reprimanded by those bishops for his ambition. Then by the favour <a id="l3390"></a>of the western Emperor Constans he prevailed to have a Council <a id="l3391"></a>summoned by Imperial authority out of both Empires to meet at <a id="l3392"></a>Serdica in the year 347. About eighty eastern Bishops came to <a id="l3393"></a>Serdica but finding that matters were prejudged by the western <a id="l3394"></a>Bishops in favour of the pretended authority of the Bishop of Rome <a id="l3395"></a>they went back &amp; the remaining part of the Council  decreed appeals from all the Churches to <a id="l3397"></a>the Bishop of Rome, &amp; thereby gave him the supremacy over all the <a id="l3398"></a>west. For the western churches submitted to that decree. And these <a id="l3399"></a>proceedings almost made a schism between the  Churches of the <a id="l3400"></a>two Empires the people of the western Churches beginning now to <a id="l3401"></a>avoid the communion of the eastern but those of the eastern <a id="l3402"></a>not yet avoiding the communion of the western. And this tendency <a id="l3403"></a>to a schism is represented by the endeavour of the flood to carry <a id="l3404"></a>away the Woman, &amp; her new dominion in the west is represented by her <a id="l3405"></a>floting upon the waters. This did the Woman soon after she <a id="l3406"></a>had received two wings of a great Eagle begin to fly into the <a id="l3407"></a>wilderness. For the western churches headed by the  Church of Rome are <a id="l3408"></a>the woman reigning in the wilderness.</p>
            <p id="par200">But the force of the flood to carry away the woman  was <a id="l3409"></a>but of short continuance. For Magnentius slew Constans and <a id="l3410"></a>succeeded him in the west A. C. 350 &amp; within a year or two <a id="l3411"></a>was conquered by Constantius. And by that victory of  the eastern Empire over the western <a id="l3413"></a>the earth or eastern Empire helped the Woman &amp; opened her <a id="l3414"></a>mouth &amp; swallowed up the flood &amp; thereby retarded her flight <a id="l3415"></a>for a time. For by the union of the two Empires a stop was <a id="l3416"></a>put to the impending schism, &amp; the Woman with her two eagles-wings <a id="l3417"></a>continued to represent the undivided Church of the whole Em<a id="l3418"></a>pire for some time longer, &amp; the new dominion of the Bishop of <a id="l3419"></a>Rome was suspended during that time, the western Bishops being <a id="l3420"></a>forced to allow the authority of the Eastern Churches over their <a id="l3421"></a>own members in matters judicial without appeal to the Bishop <a id="l3422"></a>of Rome.</p>
            <p id="par201">By the same victory of Constantius over Magnentius the  Beast <a id="l3423"></a>was wounded to death with a sword &amp; ceased to be for a time both <a id="l3424"></a>Empires becoming united under Constantius &amp; his successors Iulian &amp; <a id="l3425"></a>Iovian till the reign of Valentinian &amp; Valens. Between them the <a id="l3426"></a>Empire became again divided A. C. 364, &amp; by this division the <a id="l3427"></a>deadly wound was healed &amp; the Beast revived &amp; soon after rose <a id="l3428"></a>out of the sea, &amp; the Woman by a new schism commencing con<a id="l3429"></a>tinued her flight into the wilderness. Then by the death of Valens <a id="l3430"></a>the Empire became united again under Gratian the successor of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p060r"> &lt;60r&gt; </span> Valentinian for about five months, &amp; by the next division <a id="l3431"></a>which was between Gratian &amp; Theodosius A. C. 378 the Dragon went <a id="l3432"></a>from the flying Woman to make war with the remnant of her seed <a id="l3433"></a>&amp; the ten horned Beast rose out of the sea to succeed him in <a id="l3434"></a>the west ; &amp; the two horned Beast rose out of the earth to <a id="l3435"></a>succeed her in the east. And at the same time the Bishop of <a id="l3436"></a>Rome recovered the universal Bishopric over all the west <a id="l3437"></a>&amp; began to govern the Churches of the Western Empire <a id="l3438"></a>by Vicars &amp; to write decretal Epistles: &amp; by this dominion <a id="l3439"></a>she began to sit upon the Beast &amp; to change times &amp; laws. And <a id="l3440"></a>in those days the invocation of Saints overspread all the churches <a id="l3441"></a>&amp; thereby she became the Whore of Babylon.</p>
            <p id="par202">Theodosius reigned in the east &amp; Gratian with his young brother <a id="l3442"></a>Valentinian in the west. Maximus compassed the death of Gratian <a id="l3443"></a>&amp; made Valentinian fly into the east &amp; succeeded them. Theo<a id="l3444"></a>dosius A. C. 388 conquered Maximus &amp; restored Valentinian &amp; <a id="l3445"></a>reigned with him three years in the west &amp; returned into the <a id="l3446"></a>east A. C. 391. Eugenius A. C. 392 compassed the death of <a id="l3447"></a>Valentinian &amp; succeeded him in the western Empire, but <a id="l3448"></a>Theodosius made his younger son Honorius Emperor of the West <a id="l3449"></a>in the room of Valentinian, conquered Eugenius A. C. 394, died <a id="l3450"></a>three or four months after; &amp; by his last will &amp; testament <a id="l3451"></a>left the Empire divided between his two sons Arcadius and <a id="l3452"></a>Honorius. After which the two Empires were united no more. <a id="l3453"></a>By conquering the west &amp; resigning the conquest to Honorius <a id="l3454"></a>the Dragon gave the Beast his power &amp; throne. The Beast <a id="l3455"></a>revived before he could ascend out of the Sea, &amp; ascended <a id="l3456"></a>before the Dragon who stood upon the land could give him <a id="l3457"></a>his power &amp; throne. These were three distinct successive acts <a id="l3458"></a>&amp; imply three successive divisions of the Empire, &amp; can agree <a id="l3459"></a>to no other then the three last divisions, those three to which <a id="l3460"></a>we have applied them. Theodosius by conquering Maximus <a id="l3461"></a>reigned over both Empires, over the east with Arcadius &amp; over <a id="l3462"></a>the west with Valentinian &amp; Honorius. Thus the Empire was <a id="l3463"></a>united under him in the last seven years of his reign, &amp; yet <a id="l3464"></a>at the same time divided between Arcadius who was Emperor <a id="l3465"></a>of the east &amp; Valentinian &amp; Honorius who were successive <a id="l3466"></a>Emperors of the west. The Dragon therefore in some respect <a id="l3467"></a>reigned over the whole Empire even after the Beast was risen <a id="l3468"></a>&amp; this reign is to be referred to his seventh head. And when <a id="l3469"></a>Theodosius by his last will &amp; testament left the Empire <a id="l3470"></a>divided between his sons &amp; was succeeded in the eastern Empire <a id="l3471"></a>by his eldest son Arcadius, the Dragon gave the Beast his western <a id="l3472"></a>throne &amp; power. And this reign of the Beast is the eighth &amp; <a id="l3473"></a>of the seven. And now, the Beast being revived &amp; risen out of the <a id="l3474"></a>abyss &amp; having received the Dragons ancient throne, we are to <a id="l3475"></a>expect the reigns of the ten horns. For they were to receive power <a id="l3476"></a>as kings at the same time with the Beast, that is, at that time <a id="l3477"></a>when the  Dragon gave  the Beast his power &amp; throne &amp; great authority. And <a id="l3478"></a>accordingly the  Western Empire became divided into ten kingdoms <a id="l3479"></a>in the reign of the Emperors Arcadius &amp; Honorius as we shewed <a id="l3480"></a>above.</p>
            <p id="par203">Before the Woman received two wings of a great Eagle <em class="underline">there <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p061r"> &lt;61r&gt; </span> was war in heaven, Michael &amp; his Angels fought against <a id="l3481"></a>the Dragon, &amp; the Dragon fought &amp; his Angels &amp; prevailed <a id="l3482"></a>not, neither was their place found any more in heaven. <a id="l3483"></a>And the great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent called <a id="l3484"></a>the Devil &amp; Satan which deceiveth the whole world, <a id="l3485"></a>he was cast out into the earth &amp; his Angels were cast <a id="l3486"></a>out with him. And Iohn heard a loud voice saying in <a id="l3487"></a>heaven, Now is come salvation &amp; strength &amp; the kingdom of <a id="l3488"></a>our God &amp; the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our <a id="l3489"></a>brethren is cast down who accused them before our God day &amp; <a id="l3490"></a>night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb &amp; by <a id="l3491"></a>the word of their testimony, &amp; they loved not their lives unto <a id="l3492"></a>the death.</em> This is a very plain description of a great <a id="l3493"></a>conflict between the Roman heathen Empire &amp; the army <a id="l3494"></a>of Christ. For Michael &amp; his Angels are Christ &amp; his <a id="l3495"></a>army, such an army as was accused by the Dragon day &amp; <a id="l3496"></a>night &amp; loved not their lives unto the death, such an <a id="l3497"></a>army as overcame the Dragon by the blood of the Lamb <a id="l3498"></a>&amp; by the word of their testimony, that is, an army of <a id="l3499"></a>martyrs &amp; confessors. And this war between Michael &amp; <a id="l3500"></a>the Dragon was managed on the Dragon's part by accusing <a id="l3501"></a>&amp; persecuting the Christians &amp; putting them to death for <a id="l3502"></a>their religion &amp; on the Christians part by confessing &amp; <a id="l3503"></a>testifying the truth of their religion &amp; persisting in <a id="l3504"></a>their confession &amp; testimony without fearing to lose their <a id="l3505"></a>lives for the same. And by this conflict the Dragon <a id="l3506"></a>that old Serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan, that is, the <a id="l3507"></a>heathen Roman Empire in respect of its religion, was <a id="l3508"></a>overcome &amp; cast out of heaven to the earth &amp; was succeeded <a id="l3509"></a>in the throne by a new kingdom called the kingdom of <a id="l3510"></a>God. For the conflict ended with a voice from heaven <a id="l3511"></a>saying: <em class="underline">Now is come salvation &amp; strength &amp; the</em> KING<a id="l3512"></a>DOM <em class="underline">of our</em>  GOD, <em class="underline">for the accuser of our brethren is <a id="l3513"></a>cast down</em>. And all this can agree to nothing else then <a id="l3514"></a>the  last of the heathen persecutions <a id="l3515"></a>which began in the reign of Dioclesian A. C. 302 &amp; lasted <a id="l3516"></a>almost two years over all the Roman Empire, &amp; ten <a id="l3517"></a>years together with great violence over all the east, &amp; was greater then <a id="l3518"></a>all the former persecutions taken together, &amp; which <a id="l3519"></a>ended in the ruin of the heathen Roman Empire &amp; the <a id="l3520"></a>setting up of a Christian Empire in its room under <a id="l3521"></a>Constantine the great.</p>

For since this Parable ends with <a id="l3536"></a>the flight of the Woman into the wilderness, &amp; that of <a id="l3537"></a>the war between Michael &amp; the Dragon ends also with <a id="l3538"></a>the same flight, both the Parables ending at the same <a id="l3539"></a>time must be synchronal &amp; concern the same revolu<a id="l3540"></a>tion of the Empire. For describing &amp; pointing out <a id="l3541"></a>this grand revolution more clearly &amp; fully the descripti<a id="l3542"></a>on is repeated. The woman travailing in birth &amp; pained <a id="l3543"></a>to be delivered signifies the Church in affliction by a <a id="l3544"></a>great persecution which ended in the birth of a Christian <a id="l3545"></a>kingdom &amp; therefore was Dioclesian's persecution. And the <a id="l3546"></a>same persecution is signified by the Dragon's drawing the <a id="l3547"></a>third part of the stars of heaven &amp; casting them to the <a id="l3548"></a>earth. This act shews that the Dragon is the persecu<a id="l3549"></a>tor &amp; the other of the Woman's being pained in child<a id="l3550"></a>birth, that she is the person persecuted. The third part <a id="l3551"></a>of the stars of heaven or stars of the third part of the  Christian world are the <a id="l3552"></a>martyrs &amp; Confessors of the Provinces of the Greek Empire <a id="l3553"></a>where the persecution was very vehement &amp; lasted ten <a id="l3554"></a>years together being carried on by Dioclesian Galerius <a id="l3555"></a>&amp; Maximinius successively, besides what the Christians <a id="l3556"></a>of that part of the Empire suffered afterwards under <a id="l3557"></a>Licinius. For in the western part of the Empire <a id="l3558"></a>where Herculius, Constantius &amp; Constantine reigned suc<a id="l3559"></a>cessively the persecution lasted scarce two full years <a id="l3560"></a>being stopt by Constantius; &amp; the Martyrs &amp; Confessors <a id="l3561"></a>were so few, &amp; made so small an appearance, that <a id="l3562"></a>before the end of two years there were pillars set up by <a id="l3563"></a>the heathens in several parts of Spain, with inscriptions <a id="l3564"></a>signifying that the superstition of Christ &amp; name of Christi<a id="l3565"></a>ans were every where extinguished. In Dalia &amp; such other Provinces as had newly revolted from the old Roman Empire &amp; make another third part there was no persecution at all. The Man-child <a id="l3566"></a>which the Woman brought forth is not a single person, but <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p063r"> &lt;63r&gt; </span> a kingdom as Isaias interprets the type. For the Woman is <sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> <a id="l3567"></a>a body politick &amp; the child must be a body of the same <a id="l3568"></a>kind with the mother. And this kingdom was Christian <a id="l3569"></a>because it was the son of the Woman &amp; was to rule all <a id="l3570"></a>nations with a rod of iron, which in this Prophesy is the <a id="l3571"></a>scepter of Christs kingdom. The persecution began by an <a id="l3572"></a>Edict for demolishing the Churches &amp; burning the sacred <a id="l3573"></a>books throughout the Empire A. C. 302, &amp; the Man-child <a id="l3574"></a>was born in the western part of the Empire by the victory <a id="l3575"></a>of Constantine the great over Maxentius in the end of <a id="l3576"></a>the persecution A. C. 312. . And six years after by <a id="l3579"></a>the victory of Constantine over Licinius a heathen persecuting <a id="l3580"></a>Emperor who reigned in the east, the Man-child was caught <a id="l3581"></a>up to the throne of the whole Empire viz<sup>t</sup> A. C. 318. And the Dragon <a id="l3582"></a>at the same time being cast out of heaven by Michael, began to <a id="l3583"></a>come down among the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea with great <a id="l3584"></a>wrath knowing that he hath but a short time, that is, the hea<a id="l3585"></a>thens being cast out of their old throne flowed into the <a id="l3586"></a>Christian Churches of the earth &amp; Sea, making an outward <a id="l3587"></a>shew &amp;  profession of the Christian religion for temporal <a id="l3588"></a>ends but retaining their vicious lives &amp; heathen principles &amp; in<a id="l3589"></a>clinations to superstition, &amp; thereby they soon corrupted the Chris<a id="l3590"></a>tian religion &amp; filled it full of the vices &amp; superstitions of the <a id="l3591"></a>heathens, making hast to do this because the Dragon had but a <a id="l3592"></a>short time to reign among the Christians before he should be cast <a id="l3593"></a>into the bottomless pit. When therefore the Dragon that old serpent the spirit of error saw that he <a id="l3594"></a>was cast down he troubled persecuted the Woman &amp; by the building of Constan<a id="l3595"></a>tinople A. C. 330 she received two wings of a great Eagle that <a id="l3596"></a>she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished from <a id="l3597"></a>the face of the serpent, &amp; after he had put her to flight &amp; <a id="l3598"></a>oppressed the remnant of her seed he reigned a short time.</p>
                <p id="par207"><span class="ns"></span> The heathens <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 58v &gt; </span><span class="ns"></span>The heathens supposed the souls of dead men to be either parts or powers of the <a id="l3599"></a>supreme God &amp;  under  that pretense worshipped them by various names  as divine persons &amp; called <a id="l3600"></a>those persons Gods.  The Dragon in respect of this spirit of error &amp; idolatry of the heathens is called <a id="l3601"></a> that old serpent the Devill &amp; Satan who deceiveth the whole world. When <a id="l3602"></a>that old Serpent saw that he was cast out of the heathen Roman throne he came <a id="l3603"></a>down among the Christian inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea.  For at that time the doctrine <a id="l3604"></a>that the son was  λόγος ἐνδιάθετος  the inherent reasong wisdom &amp; understanding of the father without which the father would <a id="l3605"></a>be ἄσοφος &amp; ἄλογος void of wisdom &amp; understanding spread much in the Churches  This was the doctrine of Basilides Valentinus &amp; the Gnosticks, or Tatian &amp; the Encratites, of Tertullian, Proculus Æchines <a id="l3607"></a>&amp; the Montanists, of Praxeas, Artemas, Paul of Samosat, Hermogenes, Sabellius &amp; the Patripassians; <a id="l3608"></a> &amp; Constantine the great with some bishops about him lapsed into this <a id="l3609"></a>opinion. And the waters which the Dragon cast out of his mouth after the Woman were much infected <a id="l3610"></a>with it.  For the Council of Serdica were of this opinion as appears by their Epistle <a id="l3611"></a>as it is recited entire by Theodoret. But God Witnesses prophesied against it and the earth also  helped the woman: for when Con<a id="l3612"></a>stantius came against Magnentius he called a Council at Sirmium which condemned this <a id="l3613"></a>doctrine in Photinus &amp; put a stop to its growth. For the decrees of this Council were <a id="l3614"></a>universally  approved &amp; received by the Churches  of the whole Empire both then &amp; after<a id="l3615"></a>wards &amp; the language of one hypostasis of the father son &amp; holy Ghost which was then in fashion soon changed <a id="l3616"></a>into that of three hypostases. Afterwards the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea repre<a id="l3617"></a>sented by the two wings of the Woman  were interdicted buying &amp; selling untill they <a id="l3618"></a>received the mark or name of the Beast or number of his name &amp; as many of them <a id="l3619"></a>as kept the commandments of God &amp; persisted in the testimony of Iesus were sealed with <a id="l3620"></a>the name of God in their foreheads &amp; by reason of their testimony are called the two <a id="l3621"></a>witnesses, &amp; continue in affliction &amp; dispersion while the old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan <a id="l3622"></a>reigns amongst the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea with great wrath knowing that he hath <a id="l3623"></a>but a short time, &amp; all men whose names are not written in the book of life worship the Beast <a id="l3624"></a>&amp; wonder when they behold him.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 63r resumes &gt; </span><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup>  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p064r"> &lt;64r&gt; </span> </p>

The four first are the  four horsmen which <a id="l3698"></a>the four Beasts standing towards the four winds of heaven <a id="l3699"></a>call Iohn to come &amp; see &amp; which therefore stood in the regions <a id="l3700"></a>of the Beasts, the first horsman to the east the second to <a id="l3701"></a>the west the third to the south &amp; the fourth to the north. <a id="l3702"></a>Riding signifies reigning &amp; the four Beasts with their faces <a id="l3703"></a>of a Lion, Ox, Man &amp; Eagle allude to the armies of <a id="l3704"></a>Israel encamped about the tabernacle in the wilderness <a id="l3705"></a>in four bodies under their banners; the tribes of Iudah <a id="l3706"></a>Issachar &amp; Zebulon being on the east side under the stan<a id="l3707"></a>dard of a Lion, those of Reuben Simeon &amp; Gad on the <a id="l3708"></a>south side under the standard of a Man, those of Ephra<a id="l3709"></a>im Manasseh &amp; Benjamin on the west side under the <a id="l3710"></a>standard of an Ox, &amp; those of Dan Asher &amp; Naphtali <a id="l3711"></a>on the north side under the standard of an Eagle. The <a id="l3712"></a>encampment is described in the book of numbers &amp; the Iews <a id="l3713"></a>keep a tradition of the standards. Every Horsman therefore with the horse <a id="l3714"></a>he rides upon &amp; the Beast which appears in the same region <a id="l3715"></a>with him is a fit emblem of an Emperor with his Empire &amp; <a id="l3716"></a>his army under its standard. And thus the four hors-men <a id="l3717"></a>with their Beasts very fitly represent four reigns or <a id="l3718"></a>dynasties of Emperors.</p>
            <p id="par212">The first Emperors were Italians called the twelve <a id="l3719"></a>Cæsars. Of these there were two dynasties, the first of <a id="l3720"></a>the family of Iulius Cæsar which lasted till the death of <a id="l3721"></a>Nero, the next of the family of Vespasian which lasted <a id="l3722"></a>till the death of Domitian the last of the twelve Cæsars. <a id="l3723"></a>The Apocalyps was written in the end of the first &amp; is <a id="l3724"></a>of things future, &amp; therefore we are to begin with <a id="l3725"></a>the next. Of this dynasty there were only three Empe<a id="l3726"></a>rors, Vespasian &amp; his two sons Titus &amp; Domitian. <a id="l3727"></a>Vespasian was created Emperor in the East in the time <a id="l3728"></a>of the Iewish war.

            <p id="par214">This prophesy therefore of the scripture of truth takes in the time times &amp; half a time <a id="l3750"></a>which is the reign of the last horn of Daniels fourth Beast.

And thence it seems to me that the Dragon <a id="l3754"></a>&amp; ten-horned Beast in Iohn, are the same with the He-Goat &amp; fourth Beast in Daniel. . The Beast hath ten horns in <a id="l3758"></a>both cases.

            <p id="par216">The things predicted in the first six seales are again <a id="l3781"></a>predicted in the Prophesy of the woman &amp; Dragon, which as we <a id="l3782"></a>told you, is a repetition of the prophesy of  opening the seales. <a id="l3783"></a>First there are lightnings &amp; voices &amp; thunderings &amp; an earthquake <a id="l3784"></a>&amp; great hail, &amp; these express in general the wars made by the <a id="l3785"></a>four horsmen at the opening of the first four seales.

            <p id="par217">Gregory of Nyssen tells us that after the persecution of <a id="l3829"></a>Decius, Gregory Bishop of Neocœsarea in Pontus <em class="underline">instituted among <a id="l3830"></a>all people, as an addition &amp; corollary of devotion towards God, <a id="l3831"></a>that festival days &amp; assemblies should be celebrated to them <a id="l3832"></a>who had contended for the faith,</em> that is, to the Martyrs. And <a id="l3833"></a>he adds this reason for the institution. <em class="underline">When he observed that <a id="l3834"></a>the simple &amp; unskilful multitude by reason of corporeal <a id="l3835"></a>delights remained in the error of Idols; that the principal <a id="l3836"></a>thing might be corrected among them, namely that instead <a id="l3837"></a>of their vain worship &amp; superstition they might turn their <a id="l3838"></a>eyes upon God: he permitted that at the memories of the holy <a id="l3839"></a>Martyrs they might make merry &amp; delight themselves &amp; <a id="l3840"></a>be resolved into joy.</em> The heathens were delighted with the <a id="l3841"></a>festivals of their Gods &amp; unwilling to  part with those delights <a id="l3842"></a>&amp; therefore Gregory to facilitate their conversion instituted <a id="l3843"></a> annualy festivals to the Christian saints &amp; Martyrs. And hence <a id="l3844"></a>it came to pass that the principal festivals of the Christians <a id="l3845"></a>succeeded in the room of the principal festivals of the Heathens. <a id="l3846"></a>as keeping of Christmas in the room of the Saturnalia, the <a id="l3847"></a>celebrating of May day with flowers in the room of the flora<a id="l3848"></a>lia, &amp; the keeping of festivals to  the Virgin <a id="l3849"></a>Mary, Iohn the Baptist &amp; most of the Apostles at the entrance <a id="l3850"></a>of the Sun into the  signes of the Zodiac in the old Iulian Calendar. <a id="l3851"></a>In the same persecution of Decius Cyprian ordered the passi<a id="l3852"></a>ons of the Martyrs in Afric to be registered in order to cele<a id="l3853"></a>brate their memories annually with oblations &amp; sacrifices. <a id="l3854"></a>And Felix Bishop of Rome a little after, as Platina re<a id="l3855"></a>lates, <em class="underline">Martyrum gloriæ consulens constituit ut quotannis <a id="l3856"></a>sacrifica eorum nomine celebrarentur,</em> consulting the glory <a id="l3857"></a>of the Martyrs ordeined that  sacrifices should be ce<a id="l3858"></a>lebrated annually in their name. By the pleasure of these <a id="l3859"></a>festivals the Christians increased much in number &amp; decreased as <a id="l3860"></a>much in vertue untill they were purged &amp; made white by the <a id="l3861"></a>Persecution of Dioclesian. And this was the first step made <a id="l3862"></a>in the Christian religion towards the veneration of the mar<a id="l3863"></a>tyrs. And tho it did not yet amount to an unlawfull worship <a id="l3864"></a>yet it disposed the Christians towards such a further venera<a id="l3865"></a>tion of the dead as in a short time ended in the invocation of <a id="l3866"></a>Saints</p>
            <p id="par218">The next step was the affecting to pray at the sepulchres <a id="l3867"></a>of the Martyrs &amp; the bringing their bodies as holy things into the Oratories or <a id="l3868"></a>Churches of the Christians,  which practice began at the end of <a id="l3869"></a>Dioclesians persecution. The Council of Eliberis in Spain celebrated in <a id="l3870"></a>the third year of Dioclesians persecution A.

And hence came the <a id="l3903"></a>custome of translating the bodies of the saints &amp; mar<a id="l3904"></a>tyrs into such Churches as were new built after the per<a id="l3905"></a>secution &amp; of dedicating the new churches to the saints <a id="l3906"></a>buried in them.

            <p id="par219"><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 69v &gt; </span>A superstition of the same kind with the worship of saints &amp; their reliques is the adoration of the  wood of the cross as a relique of Christ &amp; ascribing to it &amp; to the signe of the cross a supernatural power.

Athanasius in his first Oration against the Gentiles <a id="l3949"></a>written before the Arian controversy began suppose about the year 320, tells us that  <em class="underline">by the signe of the cross all apparitiory <a id="l3952"></a>of Devils disappear.</em> And in his second Oration written at the same time <a id="l3953"></a>on the same subject he saith that <em class="underline">Christ gives victory against death <a id="l3954"></a>&amp; weakens death in all those who have his faith &amp; carry the signe of</em> <a id="l3955"></a>the cross.

            <span class="pagenumber" id="p069v"> &lt;69v&gt; </span>
                <p id="par220"></p>
                <p id="par221" class="insetLeft40">The same Athanasius in the life of <a id="l3990"></a>Antony the common father of all Moncks, tells how this Antony in the reign of Dioclesian taught <a id="l3991"></a>those that came to him to fortify themselves with the signe of the cross against the apparitions of <a id="l3992"></a>Devils &amp; how in the tenth persecution &amp; afterwards he signed himself with the cross for that purpose. <a id="l3993"></a>And Eusebius tells us how Constantine the  great declared that his soldiers  who  warred under this <a id="l3994"></a>signe in their standards  were protected in battel while others at a <a id="l3995"></a>distance from it lost their lives. And if the Christians began so  early to attribute a <a id="l3996"></a>miraculous power to the signe of the cross, much more would they afterwars idolize the wood <a id="l3997"></a>of the cross which was found at Ierusalem by Hellena the mother of Constantine A. C. 326 <a id="l3998"></a>&amp; distinguished from the crosses of the two thieves by curing a sick woman (as was <a id="l3999"></a>pretended) &amp;  dispersed by little pieces into all the Empire insomuch that Cyril who <a id="l4000"></a>was bishop of Ierusalem in the reign of Constantius Valens &amp; Theodosius wrote that <a id="l4001"></a>the whole world was filled with the cross by pieces  carried from that city.  And the <a id="l4002"></a>devotion which Christians paid to these miracle-working pieces of the cross made  the Emperor Iulian say <a id="l4003"></a>that they adored the wood of the cross making its images in their foreheads &amp; before their <a id="l4004"></a>houses.</p>
                <p id="par222">After Christians began thus to ascribe miracles to the  signe <a id="l4005"></a>of the Cross &amp; to  disperse pieces of the wood as venerable &amp; wonder-working reliques of Christ, the next step was to ascribe the like <a id="l4006"></a>miracles to the reliques of the Saints &amp; Martyrs. And such miracles began to <a id="l4007"></a>make a noise in the reign of the Emperor Iulian, being set on foot by some <a id="l4008"></a>Christians in opposition to his proceedings against the Christian religion. For when <a id="l4009"></a>he opened the heathen temples &amp; consulted the Oracle of Apollo  Daphneus in the suburbs of Antioch <a id="l4010"></a>&amp;  pressed by many sacrifices for  an answer the Oracle , at length  told him that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p070v"> &lt;70v&gt; </span> the  bones of the Martyr Babylas which  were buried there hindered him from speaking. This was in the year 362 &amp;  Hibary in his book against Constantius written in the <a id="l4013"></a>fift year of his banishment which  I think was the same <a id="l4014"></a>year, makes this mention of what was then done in the east <a id="l4015"></a>Sane martyrio persequeris - - - - - fidei. And Gregory Nazianzen - - - <a id="l4016"></a>- - - - aspernaris.  These things made the Heathens in the reign of the same Emperor demolish <a id="l4017"></a>the sepulchres of some of the old Prophets in Phœnicia &amp; burn <a id="l4018"></a>their bones, &amp; some Christians mixing themselves with the heathens <a id="l4019"></a>gathered up some of the bones &amp; carried them to  Athanasius <a id="l4020"></a>in Ægypt who hid them in a wall of a church   as things which <a id="l4021"></a>might be profitable to a future generation. </p>
            <p id="par223">The cry of these miracles being once set on foot continu<a id="l4022"></a>ed  for many years &amp; increased &amp; grew more general. <a id="l4023"></a>For Chrisostom in his second Oration on S<sup>t</sup> Babylas twenty years <a id="l4024"></a>after the silencing of the Oracle of Apollo Daphnæus as above, saith of the <a id="l4025"></a>miracles done by the  Saints &amp; their reliques: Nulla est <a id="l4026"></a>nostri hujus orbis – – – – – was about the year 384. ‡  Chrystom in his Oration – – –  &amp; the Moncks were they that laboured most in propagating <a id="l4032"></a>these superstitions. ‡Ambrose<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the left margin of f 70v &gt; </span> ‡ Ambrose was at first free from these superstitions but A.C. 387  <a id="l4033"></a>in dedicating a Church without Martyrs was admonished by the people how he should dedicate &amp; thereupon dreamt of two martyrs Gervasius &amp; Protasus <a id="l4034"></a>whose bodies being dug up were translated into the church &amp; did many miracles &amp; part of them were distributed to other churches.  Of the miracles Ambrose <a id="l4035"></a>makes this mention Cognovistis inò vidisti upsi multos a dæmonijs purgatos, plurimos etiam ubi vestem sanctorum manibus contigerunt his quibus laborabant debili <a id="l4036"></a>tactibus absolutos. Reparata vetusti temporis miracula. The whole story you have described by Panlinus of Nola in the life of Ambrose; by Austin of Hippo in seve<a id="l4037"></a>ral parts of his works &amp; by Ambrose himself in his 85<sup>th</sup> Epistle &amp; 91<sup>st</sup> Sermon. (The distributing of  reliques occasioned many under the habit of Moncks to <a id="l4038"></a>carry the members of martyrs or pretended martyrs up &amp; down the Empire to sell: which occasioned the  Emperor Theodosius  A. C. 386 to put out this Edict.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 70v resumes &gt; </span></p>
            <p id="par224">Now by these miracles  the invocation of Saints <a id="l4039"></a>was presently set on foot.  Superstitious Christians in the reign of <a id="l4040"></a>Constantius began to tell stories of the souls of the dead saints appear<a id="l4041"></a>ing to them &amp; ascending up to heaven in a visible form as may be seen in the life of Antony. And as this <a id="l4042"></a>doctrine of Dæmons was the foundation of the heathen Idolatry so <a id="l4043"></a>it made way for the like practices among the Christians.  For <a id="l4044"></a>the miracles done by the reliques of the dead being ascribed to the powers of <a id="l4045"></a>their  separate souls   &amp; their souls being therefore looked upon <a id="l4046"></a>as Divi which had a knowledge of humane affiars &amp; could pray for us &amp; do us good <a id="l4047"></a>or hurt &amp; dayly exerted this power, it was natural to desire them to pray for us &amp; do us good.  And that they <a id="l4048"></a>did begin presently to invoke them for that end is very evident . Basil, Gregory <a id="l4049"></a>Nazianzen, Gregory Nyssen  Ephrem Syrus &amp;c set this  practice on foot in the east in the <a id="l4050"></a>reign of Valens, &amp; Pope Damasus,  did the like in the west <a id="l4051"></a>as may be seen in their writings. I shall content my self with a few <a id="l4052"></a>instances. Basil who died in the year 378 in his oration on the martyr Manas, saith: Be ye mindfull of <a id="l4053"></a>the Martyr as many of you as have enjoyed him in your dreams, as many <a id="l4054"></a>of you as in this place have been assisted by him in prayer, as many of you <a id="l4055"></a>as upon  invoking &amp; calling him by name have had him present in <a id="l4056"></a> your works, as many as he has reduced  into the way from <a id="l4057"></a>wandering, as many as he has restored to health, as many as have <a id="l4058"></a>had their dead children restored by him to life, as many as have <a id="l4059"></a>had their lives prolonged by him.

And the Dragon signifies <a id="l4102"></a>the same empire with Daniels He goat in the reign of his last horn, that <a id="l4103"></a>is, the whole Roman Empire untill it become divided into the Greek &amp; <a id="l4104"></a>Latin Empires; &amp; all the time of that division it signifies the Greek Empire <a id="l4105"></a>alone.

And hence the Dragon &amp; Beast <a id="l4110"></a>have the same heads &amp; horns, but the heads are crowned upon the <a id="l4111"></a>Dragon &amp; the horns upon the Beast. The horns are ten kingdoms into <a id="l4112"></a>which the Beast becomes divided presently after his separation from the <a id="l4113"></a>Dragon, as hath been described above. The heads are seven successive <a id="l4114"></a>Dynasties or parts into which the Roman empire becomes divided by the <a id="l4115"></a>opening of the seven seales. Before the woman fled into the wilderness <a id="l4116"></a>she being with child  of a christian empire, cried travailing (viz<sup>t</sup> in <a id="l4117"></a>the ten years persecution of Dioclesian) &amp; pained to be delivered. And the <a id="l4118"></a>Dragon (the heathen Empire) stood before her to devour her child as <a id="l4119"></a>soon as it was born. And she brought forth a man child who (at length) <a id="l4120"></a>was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her child was caught <a id="l4121"></a>up to God &amp; to his throne (in the temple, by the victory of Constantine the great <a id="l4122"></a>over Maxentius) &amp; the woman fled (from the temple) into the wilderness (of <a id="l4123"></a>Arabia to Babylon where she hath a place of riches &amp; honour &amp; dominion <a id="l4124"></a>upon the back of the Beast, prepared of God that they should feed her there <a id="l4125"></a>1260 days. And there was war in heaven (between the heathens under Maximinius &amp; the new <a id="l4126"></a>Christian Empire,) &amp; the Dragon was cast out that old serpent which deceiveth <a id="l4127"></a>the whole world, the spirit of heathen idolatry, he was cast out of the throne <a id="l4128"></a>to the earth. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, &amp; by the word <a id="l4129"></a>of their testimony. And they loved not their lives unto the death.</p>
            <p id="par227">And when the Dragon saw that he was cast down, he persecuted the <a id="l4130"></a>woman which brought forth the man child, stirring up a new persecution against <a id="l4131"></a>her in the reign of Licinius. And to the woman, by the building of Constan<a id="l4132"></a>tinople &amp; equalling it to Rome, were given two wings of a great Eagle, that <a id="l4133"></a>she might fly  into the wilderness to her place upon the <a id="l4134"></a>back of her beast, where she is nourished a time times &amp; half a time from <a id="l4135"></a>the face of the serpent. And the serpent, upon the death of Constantine the <a id="l4136"></a>great, cast out waters as a flood (viz<sup>t</sup> the western empires under Constan<a id="l4137"></a>tine junior &amp; Constans) after the Woman, that he might cause her to be <a id="l4138"></a>carried away of the flood. And the earth (the nations of Asia now <a id="l4139"></a>under Constantinople) helped the woman &amp;, by conquering the western Empire <a id="l4140"></a>now under Magnentius, swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out <a id="l4141"></a>of his mouth. And the Dragon was wroth with the woman, &amp; went to make <a id="l4142"></a>war with the remnant of her seed which kept the commandments of God <a id="l4143"></a>&amp; had the testimony of Iesus, &amp; which in that war were sealed out of all the <a id="l4144"></a>twelve tribes of Israel, &amp; remained upon mount Sion with the Lamb being in <a id="l4145"></a>number 144000 &amp; having his fathers name written in their foreheads.</p>

It was healed by a new division of the <a id="l4155"></a>empire between Valentinian &amp; Valens AN. Chr. 364. Iohn saw the Beast <a id="l4156"></a>rise out of the sea at the division thereof between Gratian &amp; Theodosius <a id="l4157"></a>A. C. 379. And the Dragon gave the Beast his power &amp; his throne &amp; <a id="l4158"></a>great authority at the death of Theodosius when he gave the western <a id="l4159"></a>empire to his son Honorius. After which the two Empires were no <a id="l4160"></a>more united. But the western Empire became presently divided into <a id="l4161"></a>ten kingdoms as above; &amp; these kingdoms at length united in religion <a id="l4162"></a>under the woman, &amp; reign with her forty &amp; two months.</p>
                <p id="par229"><em class="underline">And I behold</em>, saith Iohn, <em class="underline">another Beast coming out of the earth.</em> When the <a id="l4163"></a>Woman fled from the Dragon into the kingdome of the Beast &amp; became his <a id="l4164"></a>church, this other Beast rose up out of the earth to represent the church of <a id="l4165"></a>of the Dragon. For <em class="underline">he had two horns like the Lamb</em>, (such as were the bishopricks <a id="l4166"></a>&amp; Alexandria &amp; Antioch) <em class="underline">&amp; he spake as the Dragon</em> in matters of religion. <em class="underline">And <a id="l4167"></a>he causeth the earth</em>, or nations of the Dragons kingdom, <em class="underline">to worship the first <a id="l4168"></a>Beast whose deadly wound was healed</em>, that is to be of his religion. <em class="underline">And he doth <a id="l4169"></a>great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth <a id="l4170"></a>in the sight of men</em>; that is, he excommunicates those that differ from him <a id="l4171"></a>in point of religion. For in pronouncing their excommunications, they <a id="l4172"></a>used to swing down a lighted torch from above. <em class="underline">And he said to them that <a id="l4173"></a>dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which <a id="l4174"></a>had the wound by a sword &amp; did live</em>, that is, they should call a Council of men <a id="l4175"></a>of the religion of this Beast. <em class="underline">And he had power to give life to the image, that <a id="l4176"></a>the image should both speake, &amp; cause that as many as would not worship <a id="l4177"></a>the image of the Beast should be killed</em>, viz<sup>t</sup> mystically by dissolving their <a id="l4178"></a>churches. <em class="underline">And he causeth all both small &amp; great, rich &amp; poor, bond &amp; free, <a id="l4179"></a>to receive a mark in their right hands or in their foreheads, that no man <a id="l4180"></a>might buy or sell save he that had the mark,</em> ✝, <em class="underline">or the name of the Beast</em> <a id="l4181"></a>ΔΑΤΕΙΝΟΣ, <em class="underline">or the number of his name</em> χξς, 666: all others being <a id="l4182"></a>excommunicated.</p>

And the two witnesses prophesy 1260 dyas, that is, all the same time <a id="l4193"></a>cloathed in sackcloth. These have power, like Elijah, to shut heaven that <a id="l4194"></a>it rain not at the sounding of the first trumpet, &amp;  like Moses to turn <a id="l4195"></a>the waters into blood at the sounding of the second, &amp; to smite the earth <a id="l4196"></a>with all plagues (those of the Trumpets) as ofter as they will. These <a id="l4197"></a>prophesied at the building of the second temple like Haggai &amp; Zachary. <a id="l4198"></a>These are the two Olive trees, or churches,  which supplied the lamps with oyle Zech.

So where its said upon pouring <a id="l4239"></a>out the seventh Vial of wrath, that <em class="underline">great Babylon received the cup of <a id="l4240"></a>the wine of the fierceness of Gods wrath</em>: this relates not to the time <a id="l4241"></a>of Iohn the Apostle, but to the time of pouring out the seventh Vial <a id="l4242"></a>of wrath.

            <p id="par234"> The  great red Dragon &amp; the ten horned <a id="l4305"></a>Beast in the  Apocalyps signify the same thing with the third &amp; fourth Beast in <a id="l4306"></a>Daniel. The Dragon is the third Beast or Leopard, Leopard  that is He Goat reigning  in <a id="l4307"></a>his last horn  not his own power but in that of  the Romans.  While the Latines reigned over the Greeks <a id="l4309"></a>the whole is the Dragon, but with relation chiefly to the Greeks: <a id="l4310"></a>but after the division of the Empire into the Empires of the Greeks &amp; Latines, the <a id="l4311"></a>Dragon represents the Empire of the Greeks, &amp; the ten horned <a id="l4312"></a>Beast the Empire of the Latines. They both have ten horns because they were united for a time but <a id="l4313"></a>the Dragons horns are without crowns because they did not arise <a id="l4314"></a>within the nations  comprehended in the body of Daniels <a id="l4315"></a>third Beast. The Dragon is called the Devil &amp; Satan, &amp; Satan is <a id="l4316"></a>said to have his throne  (or royal seat) in Pergamus: &amp; the <a id="l4317"></a>He Goat in the reign of his last horn is the kingdom of Pergamus. <a id="l4318"></a>The Beast was wounded to death with a sword by the victory of  Constantius over Magnentius, his deadly wound was healed <a id="l4320"></a>by the new division of the Empire between Valentinian &amp; Valens <a id="l4321"></a>he arose out of the sea at the new division thereof between <a id="l4322"></a>Gratian &amp; Theodosius, &amp; he gave the Beast his power &amp; throne by <a id="l4323"></a>retiring into the east at the  division of the <a id="l4324"></a>Empire between the sons of Theodosius. And the Woman upon his back signifies <a id="l4325"></a>the same thing with the little horn of Daniels fourth Beast. In <a id="l4326"></a>allusion to the Babylonian captivity in which the Iews were carried <a id="l4327"></a>captive through the wilderness of Arabia deserta to Babylon she <a id="l4328"></a>is called Babylon &amp; said to fly from the temple through the wilderness unto her <a id="l4329"></a>place upon the back of the Beast where she is fed &amp; nourished, that is, unto her state of riches <a id="l4330"></a>&amp; honour at which she arrived in the reign of Charles the great <a id="l4331"></a>or not long after. At the division of the Empire she became the Church of the Beast  The book in the right hand of him that <a id="l4345"></a>sitteth upon the Throne is the scripture of truth said by Daniel <a id="l4346"></a>to be sealed untill the time of the end. The Lamb opens the <a id="l4347"></a>seals thereof successively untill the Beast rises out of the sea. <a id="l4348"></a>The seven Epistles sent to the seven churches of Asia refer <a id="l4349"></a>to seven successive states of the true Church  before she flies <a id="l4350"></a>into the wilderness; the opening of the seven seals referrs to   seven successive states of <a id="l4351"></a>the Empire during the same time, that is untill the Beast rises out <a id="l4352"></a>of the sea: &amp; the sounding of  the seven Trumpets <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p076r"> &lt;76r&gt; </span> denotes seven successive great wars  the first of which begins <a id="l4353"></a>with the death of the Emperor Theodosius teh  great, &amp; the last  <a id="l4354"></a>is that by which Christ with his two edged sword smites the nations &amp; <a id="l4355"></a>the stone cut out without hands fall upon the feet of the Image <a id="l4356"></a>&amp; puts an end to the four monarchies. The seven thunders are the <a id="l4357"></a>seven wars to which the Trumpets sound. And the seven viols of wrath are <a id="l4358"></a>poured out at the sounding of those Trumpets. These things allude <a id="l4359"></a>to the feast of Tabernacles kept in the Temple seven days together <a id="l4360"></a>by great sacrifices at which the Trumpets sounded, the  Levites <a id="l4361"></a>sang loud with Thundering voices, &amp; the Priests poured out Vials of <a id="l4362"></a>drink offerings. Thus the six intervalls  between the first &amp; last <a id="l4363"></a>Trumpet, Thunder, &amp; Vial, answer to the number of the Beast 666. <a id="l4364"></a>In sounding the first four Trumpets, the scene of sacred prophesy <a id="l4365"></a>comprehending all the nations of the four Monarchies is considered <a id="l4366"></a>as  divided into three parts, which are the  fourth <a id="l4367"></a>Beast or nations of the Latine Empire, the third Beast or nations <a id="l4368"></a>of the Greek Empire &amp; the two first Beasts or nations beyond <a id="l4369"></a> Euphrates under the king of Persia. The first Viol <a id="l4370"></a>was poured upon the Earth, that is, upon the nations of of which <a id="l4371"></a>the two horned Beast arose &amp; this Beast is called a fals Prophet <a id="l4372"></a>to signify that he was of an ecclesiastical kind, &amp; spake as the Dragon, that is, in point of religion, &amp; so was his <a id="l4373"></a>Church. When the Empire became divided into the Greek &amp; Latine <a id="l4374"></a>Empires, the Church of  the whole Empire became divided into the Churches <a id="l4375"></a>of the Greek &amp; Latine Empires; &amp; this is represented by the Womans <a id="l4376"></a>flying from her first station headed by the seven Churches of Asia, to <a id="l4377"></a>her  new station in the west under the Bishop of Rome  to whom the <a id="l4378"></a>Emperor Gratian now granted appeals from all the western Churches, <a id="l4379"></a>&amp; thereby made her the Church of the western Empire; &amp; by the rise <a id="l4380"></a>of  the two horned Beast repre<a id="l4381"></a>senting a new Church in the East headed by the Bishops of Antioch <a id="l4382"></a>&amp; Alexandria. And when the Woman fled she left a remnant <a id="l4383"></a>of her seed which kept the commandments of God &amp; had the <a id="l4384"></a>testimony Iesus Christ &amp;  in opposition to the <a id="l4385"></a>two horned Beast are called the two witnesses.</p>
            <p id="par235">In allusion to the Temple of Solomon &amp; to Gods sitting therein upon <a id="l4386"></a>a throne above the Ark between the Cherubims, &amp; to the chambers <a id="l4387"></a>of the 24 Princes of the Priests (1 Chron. 24) &amp; to the golden Candlestick &amp;  brazen sea &amp; to the people in the <a id="l4388"></a>four sides of the great court: Iohn sees a throne &amp; him that sat <a id="l4389"></a>thereon &amp; round about the throne 24 Elders sitting on thrones with Crowns <a id="l4390"></a>on their heads, &amp; before the throne seven lamps &amp; a sea of glass &amp;  round the throne four <a id="l4391"></a>Beasts full of eyes to represent multitudes. And in allusion to the <a id="l4392"></a>book of the Law in the side of the Ark &amp; to the morning sacrifice Iohn saw a book sealed with <a id="l4393"></a>seven seals in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne, &amp; a <a id="l4394"></a>Lamb at the altar as it were slain. And when the four Beasts give <a id="l4395"></a>glory &amp; honour &amp; thanks to him that sitteth upon the throne, the <a id="l4396"></a>Elders also worship him  saying, Thou art worthy o Lord to receive <a id="l4397"></a> glory &amp; honour &amp; power because thou hast created all things <a id="l4398"></a>&amp; for thy pleasure they are &amp; were created.  And the Beast &amp; Elders <a id="l4399"></a>worship also the Lamb saying Thou are worthy to take the book &amp; open <a id="l4400"></a>the seals thereof: for thou wast slain &amp; hast redeemed us  to God by thy <a id="l4401"></a>blood  out of every kindred &amp; tongue <a id="l4402"></a>&amp; people &amp; nation &amp; hast made us unto our God kings &amp; Priests &amp; we <a id="l4403"></a>shall reign on the earth. And the Angels about the throne &amp; the Beasts &amp; Elders said with <a id="l4404"></a>a loud voice: Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power &amp; <a id="l4405"></a>riches &amp; wisdome &amp; strength &amp; honour &amp; glory &amp; blessing. And every <a id="l4406"></a>creature said Blessing &amp; honour &amp; glory &amp; power be unto him that <a id="l4407"></a>sit upon the throne &amp; unto the Lamb for ever &amp; ever. And the four <a id="l4408"></a>Beasts said, Amen. And the 24 Elders fell down &amp; worshipped him that <a id="l4409"></a>liveth for ever. This is the form of worship here prescribed to Gods people. </p>

The next year his successor Omar sent fresh forces into Syria <a id="l4415"></a>which put the Romans to flight &amp; after half a yearse siedge took Damascus, &amp; the year <a id="l4416"></a>following they won several battels &amp;  beseiged Ierusalem. </p>
            <p id="par237">Hitherto the Califs reigned at Medina   but the next year A. C. 637 they  translated the seat of <a id="l4418"></a>their kingdom from  Arabia into Syria.

And the same year they took also the royal city of <a id="l4421"></a>the king of Persia with his Treasures &amp; Crown &amp; conquered a considerable part of Persia putting the Persi<a id="l4422"></a>ans to flight.  Which successes may be recconed the beginning of their Empire. Before this year <a id="l4425"></a>they were only <a id="l4426"></a>kings of Arabia but now they began to be emperors of the East  having conquered Phœni<a id="l4427"></a>cia, Syria Damascena, Chaldea , part of Persia &amp; some part of Egypt &amp; beginning to reign at Damascus &amp; Omar being <a id="l4428"></a>the first Calif to whom they gave the title of Imperator fidelium.

            <p id="par238">The next year A. C. 638 he took Antioch with all Syria.  The year following his army <a id="l4431"></a>became masters of Gran Cairo in Egypt &amp; besieged Alexandria &amp; after 14 months siege <a id="l4432"></a>they took Alexandria  A.

            <p id="par247">How much the Romans [Catholicks  both Greeks &amp; Latines] were  plagued &amp; tormented by the <a id="l4474"></a>the Saracens during all these three Dynasties,  is sufficiently related in the histories of those times.  And this plague fell upon the Latins as well as upon the Greeks  <a id="l4476"></a>was predicted.   For <em class="underline">the fift Angel poured out his Vial upon the seal of the Beast.</em> The <a id="l4478"></a>Men who  had not the mark of God in their foreheads that is those who <a id="l4479"></a>by the influence of the two horned Beast received the mark of the ther Beast are <a id="l4480"></a>still  most properly the Greeks &amp; the Beast himself is the Latines &amp; both together comprehend the <a id="l4481"></a>people of the whole Roman Empire. This plague fell upon the whole Empire. <em class="underline">And <a id="l4482"></a>they g</em>nawed their tongues for pain &amp; blasphemed the God of heaven because <a id="l4483"></a><em class="underline">of their pains &amp; sores &amp; repented not their deeds</em>. This plague was inflicted <a id="l4484"></a>upon them for their idolatry &amp; yet the more they were plagued the more <a id="l4485"></a>they  worshipped their Idols &amp; false Gods which in this prophesy is called <a id="l4486"></a>blaspheming God. For after the use of Images was defended by Gregory the Great &amp; by the authority of the P. &amp; Gr. Emp. the images of the Virgin Mary &amp;  the Martyrs were <a id="l4487"></a>set up in the Pantheon  at Rome the images of the saints <a id="l4488"></a> were set up by degrees in all churches being consecrated &amp; called Holy imgaes <a id="l4489"></a>&amp; the  catholicks grew more &amp; more superstitious towards them till many of the people <a id="l4490"></a> worshipped  them with such a worship as others took for idolatry whereupon the Greek <a id="l4491"></a>Emperor Leo Isaurus A. C. 725 ordered all Images to be demolished &amp; forbad the invocation <a id="l4492"></a>of Saints &amp; was excommunicated for it by the Pope. And after a  long &amp; <a id="l4493"></a>sharp controversy between the Pope &amp; Greek Emperor  <a id="l4494"></a>(in which controversy some of Latine Churches  sided with the Greeks) <a id="l4495"></a>the Pope at length got the  victory  &amp; Images  have ever since been <a id="l4496"></a>worshipped by the Roman Catholicks. This victory for images was gained in the ninth century <a id="l4497"></a>&amp; in the same century the Canonizing of Saints &amp; the doctrine of transubstantiation <a id="l4498"></a> began. And before the times of this Trumpet ex<a id="l4499"></a>pired,  the idolatry of the Roman Catholicks arrived to the height. <a id="l4500"></a>Afterwards Togrulbec had severall wars for establishing himself in his kingdom &amp; conquering Iraca &amp; then died A.

Then <a id="l4763"></a>there appears a glorious Woman in heaven who being with child cried travailing <a id="l4764"></a>in birth &amp; pained to be delivered: &amp; a great red Dragon whose tail <a id="l4765"></a>drew the third part of the stars of heaven &amp; cast them to the earth <a id="l4766"></a>stood before the woman to devour her child so soon as it was born. <a id="l4767"></a> The woman is the Church of Christ: for her seed keep the command<a id="l4768"></a>ments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus Christ Apoc 12. 17.

For  For this Empire was one third part of all the nations <a id="l4772"></a>comprehended within the compass of the four monarchies which are the subject of <a id="l4773"></a> sacred Prophesy,    another third part is the western Empire  &amp; another third part is the Empire <a id="l4775"></a>of Persia including Babylon  In the last year of the persecution Constantine <a id="l4777"></a>the great was converted to Christianity &amp; overcame Maxentius &amp; <a id="l4778"></a>became Emperor of  the west &amp; contracting affinity with Licinius <a id="l4779"></a>they wrote to Maximinus to stop the persecution in the east.

This war between Constantine &amp; <a id="l4789"></a>Licinius is represented by  war in heaven between Michael &amp; the <a id="l4790"></a>Dragon.

This war is in heaven that is in the throne of the Empire <em class="underline">And the great Dragon was <a id="l4797"></a>cast out  that old serpent [heathenism] called the Devil &amp; Satan he <a id="l4798"></a>was cast out of heaven into the earth &amp; his angels were cast out <a id="l4799"></a>with him.

                <p id="par269"><em class="underline">Wo be to the  inhabiters of the earth &amp; sea: for the Devil is <a id="l4808"></a>come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath <a id="l4809"></a>but a short time.</em> From the very time that  idolatry was dethroned the <a id="l4810"></a>devil or spirit of delusion came down among the common people to <a id="l4811"></a>seduce them anew, having great wrath, (that is  <a id="l4812"></a>making hast to seduce them)  because  he knoweth that he hath but a short time before <a id="l4814"></a>he  shall be  cast into the bottomless pit &amp; shut up  so that he can <a id="l4815"></a>decive the nations no more  for a a 1000 years.  <a id="l4816"></a>This Devil is therefore the spirit of the great Antichrist that mystery of iniquity which began <a id="l4817"></a>to work in S<sup>t</sup> Pauls days,  but was not to be revealed till the Roman <a id="l4818"></a>heathen Empire which then letted  should be taken out of the way, &amp; then that wicked one <a id="l4819"></a>the man of sin the son of perdition should be revealed whose coming is after the working of Satan with <a id="l4820"></a>all power &amp; signes &amp; lying wonders &amp; with all deceivableness &amp; unrighteousness <a id="l4821"></a>&amp; whom the Lord shall consume with the breath of his mouth [signified <a id="l4822"></a>by the two edged sword] &amp; shall destroy with the brightness of his coming <a id="l4823"></a>2 Thess. 2. While the heathen Empire stood the Church was preserved <a id="l4824"></a>from corruption by  persecutions &amp; afflictions <a id="l4825"></a>which  purged her from hypocrites &amp; bad men, so that the <a id="l4826"></a> sincere part of the Christians were  always the most numerous &amp; prevailed <a id="l4827"></a>over the mystery of iniquity: but after the Empire became christian the heathens <a id="l4828"></a>flowed into the Church in great numbers making an outward profession of Christianity for temporal ends without <a id="l4829"></a>recieving the love of the truth, &amp; in these the mystery of iniquity worked <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p082v"> &lt;82v&gt; </span> till by their numbers it prevailed against the truth.  For at or about the time of opening   the seventh seale then brought into the Church <a id="l4831"></a>the invocation of dead men &amp; the ascribing of supernatural powers    <a id="l4833"></a> &amp; miraculous operations to their soules &amp; reliques &amp; shrines  &amp;  &amp; also to certain ceremonies such as were signing with a cross,  sprinkling <a id="l4835"></a>with holy water &amp; annointing with consecrated oyle. And  by daily inventing &amp; crying up such miracles &amp; writing Legends of them to be read in Churches  <a id="l4837"></a> they deceived the people &amp;  reestablished these heathen practices under the name of Christianity &amp; at length set up pictures &amp; images in their Churches &amp; <a id="l4839"></a>worshipped them as the heathens had done before, &amp; at length pretending the bread in the <a id="l4840"></a>Eucharist to be transubstantiated into the body of Christ they worshipped that as the <a id="l4841"></a>supreme God.    </p>
                <p id="par270">In the reign of Constantine &amp; his sons the Christians by an unwary zeale began to use <a id="l4849"></a>the signe of the Cross with too much superstition &amp; to  to pray at the tombs of the martyrs in honour to the Martyrs and to translate the bodies of the <a id="l4850"></a>martyrs into their Churches  turning the Christian Churches  into sepulchres as <a id="l4851"></a>the heathen Temples were before.  And in the reign of Constantius they began to tell stories of their seeing the  souls of dead men. And in the reign of Iulian the Apostate  before <a id="l4852"></a> there  began to be a rumour <a id="l4853"></a>of miracles done  by the reliques of the martyrs  &amp; in the reign <a id="l4854"></a>of  Valentinian &amp; Valens those miracles were every where preached up &amp; <a id="l4855"></a> reliques were sent  into all the Empire from <a id="l4856"></a>Egypt &amp; Syria where the mischief began &amp; the invocation of Saints was <a id="l4857"></a>at the same time set on foot   by Oratorical flourishes between <a id="l4858"></a>jeast &amp; earnest  &amp; by stories of the good effects of such devotion  <a id="l4859"></a>until the  doctrine that the   saints did hear &amp; help was brought into the <a id="l4860"></a>Churches &amp; the  Oratorical flourishes ended in direct &amp; positive prayers: so that <a id="l4861"></a>  in the reign of Theodosius this heathen doctrine that the <a id="l4862"></a>saints did hear &amp; help us  &amp; the idolatrous practice of praying to them overspread as well the western as <a id="l4863"></a>the eastern Churches &amp;  before his death or at the furthest in the reign of his sons was  generally received &amp; <a id="l4864"></a>fully established in all the Roman Empire, the whole world ringing with the <a id="l4865"></a>noise of the  miracles said to be done every where at the shrines <a id="l4866"></a>of the Saints.   And in setting up these <a id="l4867"></a> new religion the ringleaders were the Monks who feigning miracles &amp; pretending <a id="l4868"></a>by extraordinary dreams &amp; revelations to discover where the bodies of <a id="l4869"></a>the saints &amp; martyrs were buried, eug up the bones of the dead &amp;  carried <a id="l4870"></a>them up &amp; down the empire  &amp; did it so <a id="l4871"></a>very much that some recconed this to be the first resurrection spoken of <a id="l4872"></a>in the Apocalyps &amp; that the Emperors at length forbad these practises by publick Edicts. They set up altars also over   <a id="l4873"></a> the graves of such pretended saints in the fields as on the High ways for the devotion  of travellors.  <a id="l4874"></a>And  Thus did the Devil come down amongst the Inhabiters of the earth &amp; <a id="l4875"></a>sea having great wrath   &amp; making hast to set up the Abomination of desolation because he knew that he had <a id="l4876"></a>but a short time.</p>
                <p id="par271">To prosecute this matter fully would require a large discourse. I shall content <a id="l4877"></a>my self with noting the beginning of these mischiefs.  <a id="l4879"></a>Hilary  in his book  book against Constantius written in the  5<sup>t</sup> year of his banish<a id="l4880"></a>ment A. C. 361, makes this mention of what was then done in  the East. Sine <a id="l4881"></a>martyrio persequeris.

                <p id="par275">For the better understanding of all this you are to  remember that the <a id="l4906"></a> scene of the visions  is the first Temple <a id="l4907"></a>This Temple was opened in heaven for Iohn to see the visions in it &amp; there he saw the ark of the Testament  &amp; the Child bearing <a id="l4908"></a>Woman &amp; the Dragon standing by her, &amp; how her child was caught up to the throne of God above the Ark <a id="l4909"></a>&amp;  the Dragon was cast out of this Temple of heaven by Michael through the Priests Court, into the outward court or court <a id="l4910"></a>of the people which people are here called the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea, &amp;   the Woman fled from this Temple through the <a id="l4912"></a>Wilderness of Arabia to the great city Babylon &amp; left a remnant of her seed with the <a id="l4913"></a>Dragon in this Temple. There the  how the two Beasts arose out of the sea &amp; earth  &amp; the second <a id="l4915"></a>Beast deified the first &amp;  caused men to erect  an Image to him  &amp;  to worship <a id="l4916"></a>the image,   There the Dragon by the dictates of the speaking Image made war  upon the <a id="l4917"></a>remnant of the womans seed &amp; mystically killed all that would not worship the Image &amp;   all there <a id="l4918"></a>received the mark or name or number of the Beast  except the 144000, who being <a id="l4919"></a>excommunicated retire from the multitude in the outward court &amp; standing upon mount Sion <a id="l4920"></a>with the Lamb sing a new song in the midsts of the four Beasts &amp; the elders &amp; by con<a id="l4921"></a>sequence in the inner court of this Temple.  Thus the Primitive Church Catholic represented <a id="l4922"></a>by the glorious woman in heaven,  was by degrees diminished &amp;  reduced to the small <a id="l4923"></a>number of 144000,. And now the  ten-horned Beast  [upon the final division <a id="l4924"></a>of the Empire] going from this temple into the wilderness where Iohn saw  him &amp; with the <a id="l4925"></a>woman upon his back, the Dragon &amp; two-horned Beast remain alone in the outward <a id="l4926"></a>court of this Temple &amp; the  144000 worship in the inward court thereof. </p>
            
                <p id="par277">Now since this Temple had in it the Ark of the Testament  it <a id="l4934"></a>was the first Temple, or as it is afterwards called, the Temple of the Tabernacle <a id="l4935"></a>that is,  a Temple framed &amp; furnished afer the manner of the Tabernacle  &amp; by consequence with a candlestick of seven branches called in this prophesy the seven <a id="l4937"></a>candlesticks. For  in such a Temple all the visions  appeared <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p084r"> &lt;84r&gt; </span> untill Iohn was carried from this Temple into the Wilderness to see the Woman <a id="l4938"></a>&amp; her Beast who were gone thither. And the seven Angels  which sounded <a id="l4939"></a>the Trumpets &amp; coming out of this Temple poured out the Vials of wrath  are the seven  spirits <a id="l4940"></a>of God  &amp; the Angels of the seven Churches, which Churches are <a id="l4941"></a>the seven  Candlesticks in this Temple  which Angels or <a id="l4942"></a>spirits are the seven lamps burning before the throne   &amp; appearing like a rod of seven stars in the <a id="l4943"></a>right hand of the son of Man who walketh in the midst of the seven Candle<a id="l4944"></a>sticks. Apoc 1. 20 &amp; 2. 1 &amp; 3. 1 &amp; 4. 5</p>
                <p id="par278">When Iohn had seen in this Temple all the visions  from the opening of the first <a id="l4945"></a>seal to the pouring out of the last vial,  one of the seven Angels carried him away <a id="l4946"></a> from this Temple into the wilderness to see the great Whore that sitteth upon <a id="l4947"></a>many waters, that is, to see the great city Babylon  seated upon the many <a id="l4948"></a>waters of Euphrates,  which waters <a id="l4949"></a>are said to be peoples &amp; multitudes &amp; nations &amp; tongues. And there he saw the <a id="l4950"></a>Woman sitting upon the ten horned Beast, that is,  reigning over the  body politics composed of those <a id="l4951"></a>peoples &amp; multitudes &amp; nations &amp; tongues. For the ten horns of the Beast are ten kingdoms <a id="l4952"></a>over which the Woman reigneth &amp; kingdoms are peoples &amp; multitudes &amp; nations &amp; tongues. Now this woman being a church separated  departed &amp; fled from the  first Temple &amp; the Beast being the laity of this Church, &amp; every Church <a id="l4954"></a>having a place of worship, a second Temple is built whose outward court is given to <a id="l4955"></a>these Babylonia gentiles &amp; inward Court to the people of God whom these  gentiles <a id="l4956"></a>  carried away captive to Babylon.  For when a measur<a id="l4957"></a>ing reed was given to Iohn &amp; the Angel said to him Rise measure the Temple <a id="l4958"></a>&amp; altar &amp;  them that worship therein (that is the Courts of the Temple &amp; Altar &amp; <a id="l4959"></a>the little court of the people called the Weomens Court) but the court which is without the Temple leave out &amp; measure it <a id="l4960"></a>it not for it is given to the Gentiles &amp; the Holy city shall they tread under foot <a id="l4961"></a>42 months: this is a plain allusion to the Babylonian captivity &amp; to the building of <a id="l4962"></a>the  second Temple in the time of that captivity, &amp; signifies the building of a new Temple  The measuring of a  city or building  being a type of <a id="l4964"></a>building it. For when Zechary saw an Angel with a measuring reed go to measure Ie<a id="l4965"></a>rusalem – – – – – – – &amp; was called the Gentiles court.  And as Haggai &amp; Zechary <a id="l4967"></a>prophesied at the building of  Zerubbabels Temple so in allusion to those two prophets <a id="l4968"></a>there are two Prophets or Witnesses which prophesy  in the second Temple of the <a id="l4969"></a>Apocalyps &amp; these two Prophets are represented by two Candlesticks standing in this <a id="l4970"></a>Temple before the God of the earth (Apoc 11. 4) &amp; they prophesy in the kingdom of the Beast &amp; Woman because they are slain by him &amp; lye dead in the streets of the great city Babylon. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from higher up f 83v &gt; </span>which city is spiritually called Sodom  because of its whoredom &amp; Egypt where also our L<sup>d</sup> was <a id="l4971"></a>crucified because of its cruelty &amp; it treading the holy city under foot &amp; worshipping in the outward court <a id="l4972"></a>of the second Temple.</p>

<p id="par279">So then the Dragon the Woman &amp; the first Temple with  seven candlesticks continue from the <a id="l4973"></a>beginning to the end of the Prophesy &amp;  relate each of them to the whole while the Empire continues intire Empire: but <a id="l4975"></a>but  when the Empire becomes divided into the Greek &amp; Latin Empires, that <a id="l4976"></a>each Empire with its churches true &amp; false may be distinctly represented, there arise two new Beasts &amp; a <a id="l4977"></a>a new Temple is built with two candlesticks in it; &amp; the Dragon  &amp;  two-horned Beast worship in the outward <a id="l4978"></a>court of the first Temple  to &amp; represent the Empire &amp; Church of the Greeks  <a id="l4980"></a>   the woman &amp; ten-horned Beast worship in the outward court of the  new Temple &amp;  represent  the Church <a id="l4983"></a>&amp; kingdoms of the Latines including Germany  <a id="l4985"></a>The Apostates worship in the outward courts of the two Temples to represent that they have <a id="l4986"></a>an outward form of religion &amp; are Christians in name  &amp; appearance. <a id="l4987"></a>And in the inward Courts of the same two Temples are the Saints or true Churches of God  <a id="l4988"></a> diffused through both Empires &amp; represented in the Temple of the Laintes by the two Candlesticks &amp; two Witnesses &amp; in the Temple of the Greeks by the seven Candlesticks &amp; by <a id="l4989"></a>them that have the name of God on their foreheads &amp; sing on the Sea of glass,  For the seven candlesticks do <a id="l4991"></a>not cease at the division of the Empire.

                <p id="par284">So then the 7 Trumpets &amp; seven Thunders are but several names of the  one &amp; the same temple-<a id="l5034"></a>music   &amp; are synchronal to the seven  seven Vials of wrath, as may also appear <a id="l5035"></a> by the their being the prophesy of  one of the same page of the  <a id="l5036"></a>sealed book &amp; also by the following comparison.</p>

He had opened it before &amp; now he <a id="l5057"></a>appears with it open in his hand. Til a little book because it conteins <a id="l5058"></a>only a part of the former prophesy, that part which followed after all <a id="l5059"></a>the seals were open. Tis a short repetition of the Prophesy of the seventh <a id="l5060"></a>seal in another form. There  Iesus appeared in the form of a Lamb <a id="l5061"></a>with a sealed book in his hand to be opened: Here he appears in his firet form the form of  the <a id="l5062"></a> the  Hight Priest with a little book open in his hand. <em class="underline">And he set his right foot on the <a id="l5063"></a>sea &amp; his left foot on the earth.</em> Conceive him standing in the day of Expiation <a id="l5064"></a> in an elevated place without the eastern gate of inner  Court of the Temple with the book of the <a id="l5065"></a>Law in his hand in such manner that his right foot might appear as it were <a id="l5066"></a>standing upon the sea of Glass &amp; his left upon the land.  <em class="underline">And he cried with <a id="l5067"></a>a loud voice as when a lyon roareth.</em> that is he read out of the book  to <a id="l5068"></a>the people with a very loud voice as was the custome  on the day of expiation  while the Heifer <a id="l5069"></a>&amp; the Goat which was the Lords lot were burning without the Temple as was the practise. <em class="underline">And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</em> Thunders are <a id="l5070"></a>put for thundering voices &amp; signify the loud vocal music of the Temple. <a id="l5071"></a>And seven thunders are the Temple music at the sacrifices of the seven <a id="l5072"></a>days of the feast of Tabernacles. At each sacrifice the Trumpets sounded <a id="l5073"></a>&amp; the Levites sung alternately. In the prophesy of the first Book the Trum<a id="l5074"></a>pets sounded to these sacrifices; in that of this second Book the thunders utter <a id="l5075"></a>their voices to the same sacrifices: yet with this difference that the scene <a id="l5076"></a>of the visions in the prophesy of the first book is the first Temple <a id="l5077"></a>&amp; in that of the second book it is the second Temple,  For the outward <a id="l5079"></a>court of this Temple  is given to the Gentiles, as was that of  the <a id="l5080"></a>second Temple.</p>

                <h2 id="hd20" class="right">The scene of the visions for interpreting the prophesy of the first Book.</h2>
                <p id="par289">As Daniel's  two Visions of  Beasts &amp; Nebu<a id="l5081"></a>cadnezzars of  the Tree &amp; the Image have interpretations annexed to them <a id="l5082"></a>so have Iohn's  <a id="l5084"></a>prophesies of the two books. These prophesies end with the sounding &amp; prophesy of the <a id="l5085"></a>seventh trumpet.  Their interpretation  begins with the words: <em class="underline">And the Temple of God was opened <a id="l5087"></a>in heaven &amp; there was seen in his Temple the Ark of his Testament</em> <a id="l5088"></a>In the second Temple there was no Ark &amp; therefore this is the <a id="l5089"></a>first Temple.   Conceive therefore that the woman &amp; Dragon <a id="l5092"></a>appear in this Temple &amp; that the 144000 are seen  in it with the Lamb <a id="l5093"></a>on Mount Sion &amp; sing at the sacrifices before the throne &amp; before <a id="l5094"></a>the four Beasts &amp; the elders, &amp; that the Woman flyes from this <a id="l5095"></a>Temple   into the deserts of Arabia to her place at Babylon <a id="l5096"></a>upon the many waters of Euphrates where she worships other Gods, <a id="l5097"></a>wood &amp; stone, &amp; is nourished. By the Ark &amp; the Lamb &amp; the four Beasts &amp; the 144000 <a id="l5098"></a>sealed in their foreheads, you may know that these visions relate to the prophesy of <a id="l5099"></a>the first book &amp; have their scene in the same Temple with that Prophesy. What is <a id="l5100"></a>wanting in that Prophesy is here supplied, namely a description of the subject of the prophesy <a id="l5101"></a>under the forms of a Woman &amp; Dragon &amp; two Beasts, &amp; the marking the worshippers of the <a id="l5102"></a>east in opposition to the sealing of the servants of God. In the solemnity of the great fast <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p086v"> &lt;86v&gt; </span> the Attonement for the sins of the people was made by two Goats – – – – – harps. <a id="l5103"></a>All which is a description of the musick &amp; singing in the Temple. Conceive this <a id="l5104"></a>singing to be at the sacrifices of the  seven days of the feast of Taber<a id="l5105"></a>nacles, the seven Angels sounding their Trumpets &amp; the 144000 singing alter<a id="l5106"></a>nately at the sacrifices each day.</p>
            
                <p id="par291"> In the end of this scene of  Visions when two Angels come <a id="l5107"></a>out the one from the Temple with a sharp sickle the other from the Altar  having power over <a id="l5108"></a>the fire; by these Angels you are to understand the two great Officers who had the <a id="l5109"></a>charge of the Temple &amp; the Altar. It was the custome  for the <a id="l5110"></a>Priests who were to perform any part of the service of the Temple not to do <a id="l5111"></a>it till the Officer who had the direction of the service called to them to do <a id="l5112"></a>it. And in allusion to this custom, an Angel coming out of the Temple calls to the son of <a id="l5113"></a>man the great High Priest to thrust in his sickle &amp; reap, &amp;  an Angel <a id="l5114"></a>coming  out  from the Altar who had power over the fire that is an Officer who had the direction <a id="l5115"></a>of the sacrifices calls to   the sacrificer represented by the Angel with a sharp sickle to <a id="l5116"></a>thrust in his sickle &amp; gather the clusters of the vine of the earth. The <a id="l5117"></a>harvest is of the martyrs in the great tribulation, the vintage is of the wicked <a id="l5118"></a>in the battel of the great day when the  Word of God smites the nations with <a id="l5119"></a>his two edged sword &amp; treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of Gods wrath. <em class="underline">And blood <a id="l5120"></a>came out of the winepress by the space of 1600 furlongs.</em>  This was reputed the length <a id="l5122"></a>of Iudea &amp; therefore you are to conceive that Iohn saw Iudea overlowed with the <a id="l5123"></a>blood.</p>

                <p id="par295">For understanding this prophesy it is further necessary to know <a id="l5172"></a>in what order of time the several parts of this Prophesy are to be read. <a id="l5173"></a>For things that are contemporary illustrate one another, but untill it is <a id="l5174"></a>known that they are contemporary they render the Prophesy intricate &amp; confused. <a id="l5175"></a>By what has been said it is evident that the Prophesy consists of these principal <a id="l5176"></a>parts. 1 The Introduction conteining Epistles to the seven Churches. 2<sup>dl</sup>y <a id="l5177"></a>The prophesy of opening the sealed book proceeding in a continual series <a id="l5178"></a>of time from the Apostles days to the end of the world  by opening <a id="l5179"></a> seven seales &amp; sounding seven Trumpets in order; excepting that <a id="l5180"></a>the times of the seventh seale are twice described; first by the visions <a id="l5181"></a>of  sealing the servants of God  in the <em class="underline">Fast &amp;  of the</em> Palmbearing multitude <em class="underline">appearing in the</em> great Hosannah, &amp;  again <a id="l5182"></a>by opening the seventh seal in the fast &amp; sounding the seven trumpets in <a id="l5183"></a>the feast of Tabernacles which ends with the great Hosannah. The holding of the <a id="l5184"></a>winds while the saints are sealing causes the silence in heaven for half an hour <a id="l5185"></a>so soon as they are sealed the winds are let loos to hurt the earth in <a id="l5186"></a>the first Trumpet &amp; sea in the second. 3<sup>dl</sup>y  3<sup>dl</sup>y As the Prophesy of  the 144000 &amp; the <a id="l5189"></a>palm-bearing multitude is inserted between the sixt &amp; seventh seale  &amp; <a id="l5190"></a>is  contemporary to the seventh, so the pro<a id="l5191"></a>phesy of the little open book is inserted between the sixt &amp; seventh <a id="l5192"></a>Trumpet) after the manner of a parenthesis) &amp; is also contemporary to the <a id="l5193"></a>seventh seal. For the Angel who holds this book in hand &amp; the lamb <a id="l5194"></a>who  took the  first book out of Gods hand &amp; opened the seales <a id="l5195"></a>thereof are  one &amp; the same person  in a different form <a id="l5196"></a>&amp; the Books are also the same. There he took the book &amp; opened it here <a id="l5197"></a>he appears with it open in his hands &amp; therefore it conteins here a repetition of the <a id="l5198"></a>prophesy from the time that it is open; that is all the time of the seventh <a id="l5199"></a>seal. And as the prophesy of the first book in the time of the seventh <a id="l5200"></a>seal consists of two  contemporary parts, first the visions of the four <a id="l5201"></a>Angels  holding the four winds while the 144000 are sealed &amp; of the 144000 <a id="l5202"></a>when they sealed &amp; the winds are let loos to hurt the earth &amp; the sea &amp; of <a id="l5203"></a>the Palmbearing multitude;  &amp; then the visions of opening the seventh <a id="l5204"></a>seal &amp; sounding the Trumpets in order: so the prophesy of the little open book <a id="l5205"></a>being a  repetition of the prophesy of the first book during the time of <a id="l5206"></a> its being open consists of two contemporary parts <a id="l5207"></a>answering to the two contemporary parts of the  prophesy of the first <a id="l5208"></a>book of which they are a  supplemental repetition in a contrary order. The first part <a id="l5209"></a>is the prophesy of the book in the Angels hand, the second part is the prophesy <a id="l5210"></a>of the same book in Iohns belly. The first part consists in the Angel's  <a id="l5211"></a>crying with a loud voice as a lyon roareth &amp; in seven thunders uttering their voices <a id="l5212"></a>which Iohn is bid to seal up. By the scene of the visions explained above, the  Angel's crying <a id="l5213"></a>in the High Priest's reading out of the Book in the day of Expiation.  <a id="l5214"></a>&amp; the seven thunders are the singing &amp; musick of the Temple which was intermixt with the sounding of Trumpets at the great sacrifices <a id="l5215"></a>of the seven days of the feast of Tabernacles,  &amp; therefore <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p087v"> &lt;87v&gt; </span> the 7 Thunders &amp; the 7 Trumpets are but various modes of expressing <a id="l5217"></a>the same thing.

Daniels had an eleventh horn  which was an animal with eyes like the eyes of a man &amp; a mouth <a id="l5346"></a>speaking great things against the most High &amp; so was a Seer &amp; a Prophet or Prophetess exercising a jurisdiction in matters of religion &amp; it made war upon the <a id="l5347"></a>saints &amp; prevailed against them &amp; changed times &amp; laws, &amp; had a look more stout then the other horns &amp; therefore was the chief &amp; most powerful city of the Beast  &amp; in lieu <a id="l5348"></a>of this ecclesiastical blasphemy persecuting Animal Iohn's Beast has a woman on his back the mother of Harlots &amp; abominations of the earth who deceives <a id="l5349"></a>all nations with her sorceries &amp; commits fornication with the kings of <a id="l5350"></a>the earth &amp; makes all nations drunk with the wine of her fornications <a id="l5351"></a>&amp; who is drunken with the blood of saints &amp; the martyrs of Iesus, &amp; <a id="l5352"></a>in whom was found the blood of Prophets &amp; Saints &amp; of all that were <a id="l5353"></a>slain upon the face of the earth &amp; who sitteth on seven mountains &amp; is the great city which reigneth over the kings of the Earth that is the city Rome which was the metropolis of the 4th  monarchy &amp; was famous for being seated on seven hills. And further, Iohn's <em class="underline">Beast</em> is said to <a id="l5354"></a>be like a <em class="underline">Leopard</em> &amp; to have feet as the feet of a <em class="underline">Bear</em> &amp; a <a id="l5355"></a>mouth as the mouth of a <em class="underline">Lyon</em> (Apoc 13. 2) which is the description <a id="l5356"></a>of Daniel's fourth Beast. For that was dreadfull &amp; terrible ex<a id="l5357"></a>ceedingly as a Leopard is, &amp; fought &amp; stamped with his feet as a Bear <a id="l5358"></a>doth &amp; had great iron teeth wherewith he devoured &amp; brake in <a id="l5359"></a>pieces like a Lyon. Daniel's three first Beasts are here named <a id="l5360"></a>backwards &amp; Iohn's is named in room of the fourth to signify that <a id="l5361"></a>it is the fourth. And as  the little horn of Daniels Beast <a id="l5362"></a>reigned &amp; prevailed  untill a time &amp; times &amp; half <a id="l5363"></a>a time that is three times or years &amp; an half so the woman on Iohns Beast was nourished a time &amp; times &amp; an half in the wildernes &amp;  the seven mountains on which the woman sitteth are called the seven heads of the Beast &amp; therefore  the city Rome which was the metropolis of the 4<sup>th</sup>  monarchy &amp; was famous for being seated on seven hills he is that  Empire whose Metropolis was the seven hilled city. Iohn's Beast <a id="l5364"></a>continued forty &amp; two months which is also three years &amp; an half. <a id="l5365"></a> ✝  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the right margin of f 89r &gt; </span> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 89r resumes &gt; </span> When the ten horned Beast rose out of thea, the Dragon <a id="l5368"></a>gave him his power &amp; his throne &amp; great authority (Apoc. 13. 2) <a id="l5369"></a> &amp; therefore the Dragon reigned first in the Roman Empire.

                <p id="par411"> Odoacer reigned about 14 years in Italy, &amp; in the meantime Zeno the Greek Emperor <a id="l5952"></a>  contracted friendship with Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths in Thrace &amp; Pannonia,  adopted him to be his son, &amp; <a id="l5953"></a>made him Patricius &amp; Consul of Constantinople. &amp;   &amp; to divert him from invading the Eastern Empire gave him  kingdom of the west recommending to him the Roman people &amp; senate.

Whence Ennodius in <a id="l5958"></a>a Panegyric to Theodoric said, <em class="underline">ad limitem suum Romana <a id="l5959"></a>regna remeasse</em>. Theodoric reigned with great prudence <a id="l5960"></a>moderation &amp; felicity   &amp; treated <a id="l5961"></a>the Romans with singular benevolence governing them by their own laws, &amp; absteining only from the name of Emperor For Procopius tells us: Theodoricus ita sibi prentibus præfuit ut . . . . . . shubditis relinquens. [Procop de Bello Got. l. 1] And Cassiodorus . . . . superantur. In this manner. Cassiodorus tells <a id="l5962"></a>us: Rex Theodoricus Romam cunctorum votis expetitus advenit, &amp; Senatum suum mira affabilitate tractans, Romanæ <a id="l5963"></a>plebi donavit annonas, atque Urbis admirandis mœnibus, <a id="l5964"></a>deputa per annos singulos maxima pecuniæ quantitate, <a id="l5965"></a>subvenit: sub cujus fælici imperio plurimæ renovantur <a id="l5966"></a>ubes, munitissima castella condutur, consurgunt ad<a id="l5967"></a>miranda palatia, magnisque ejus operibus antiqua miracula <a id="l5968"></a>superantur.

For this   war began A. C. 535 which was the year after Iustinian had conquered the Vandals in Afric,  was waged almost wholy in Dalmatia Siburnia <a id="l6001"></a>Venetia Lumbardy &amp; put an end to their kingdom. It was Tuscia &amp; the other parts of the Empire of the Goths which <a id="l6002"></a>lay northward from Rome.  It  was very lasting;  For it continued <a id="l6003"></a> continuing about seventy years, twenty years between the Romans &amp; Ostrogoths <a id="l6004"></a>&amp; fifty years more between the Romans &amp; other barbarous nations. And it <a id="l6005"></a>was very violent &amp; destructive. Procopius reccons that more men perished in the <a id="l6006"></a>war with the Ostrogoths then in that with the Vandals. In taking Millain alone the Goths <a id="l6007"></a>slew all the males amounting (as Propius reccons) to 300000, &amp; sent the weomen captives <a id="l6008"></a>in Gallia to their allies the Burgundians;  besides what  were slain by both <a id="l6009"></a>parties in other sieges &amp; in Battels &amp; or perished by famin &amp; pestilence the consequence of great wars. <a id="l6010"></a>And Rome it self was taken &amp; retaken several times &amp;  suffered by <a id="l6011"></a>famin &amp; pestilence &amp;  dispersing her people  [She was <a id="l6012"></a>[So far dispeopled by  the wars of Alaric &amp; those of the Vandals as in this war of the Goths to have <a id="l6013"></a>great quantities of grownd unihabited within her walls  which yeilded <a id="l6014"></a>grass &amp; vegetables sufficient for nourishing a competent  number of men &amp; horses in time <a id="l6015"></a>of a siege: but by] &amp;  by these wars &amp; calamities</p>
                <p id="par413"> And thus did the <em class="underline">Sun</em>, that is the kings of the Barbarous nations, <em class="underline">scorch <a id="l6016"></a>men with great heat,</em> as is exprest at the pouring out of the fourth Vial, that is <a id="l6017"></a>with great heat of war. <em class="underline">And men were scorched with great heat &amp; blasphemed the name <a id="l6018"></a>of God who had power over these plagues, &amp; they repented not to give him glory.</em> Blas<a id="l6019"></a>phemy is in all this prophesy put for idolatry &amp; the names of blasphemy for the names <a id="l6020"></a>of  Idols. Men blasphemed  the name of God because of the heat &amp; repented not.   that is,  scorched: And instead of repenting of their  old idolatry they <a id="l6021"></a>grew more idolatrous then before: [The more they were punished the more they blasphemed:] <a id="l6022"></a> They invoked &amp; worshipped dead <a id="l6035"></a>men before &amp; now they  worshipped the pictures &amp; Images of dead</p>
                <p id="par414">Before the Empire became Christian I meet with nothing  ] in the christian reli<a id="l6037"></a>gion relating to Images or pictures. Houses Gardens  Fountains &amp; Bridges might be ador<a id="l6038"></a>ned by architects &amp; painters 7amp; the Communion cup by  Artificers who made it,  but without <a id="l6039"></a>paying any veneration  or honour to the ornaments. After the Empire became Christian <a id="l6040"></a>the statues of Christian Emperors were set up in stead of those of the heathen &amp; a civil <a id="l6041"></a>respect might be paid to them as the statues of Roman Emperors: but I do not find that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p102r"> &lt;102&gt; </span> religion was concerned in the matter  before the reign of Iulian the Apostate. <a id="l6042"></a>The Council of Eliberis in Spain ordered that there should be no pictures in churches. There was at Paneas in Syria a statue erected  by the heathens in <a id="l6043"></a>memory of Christs curing  a woman of a brass a bloody flux as Eusebius relates,  <a id="l6044"></a>Iulian ordered this statue to be thrown  down &amp; his own to be placed in the <a id="l6045"></a>room of it &amp; the Christians [gathered up the  pieces of this statue, &amp; putting <a id="l6046"></a>them together]  placed the statue of Christ in a Christian Church I suppose for preserving it.. And this is the first <a id="l6047"></a>instance that I meet with of any statue  placed in a christian Church,  <a id="l6048"></a> About this time the passions of the Martyrs began to be painted in <a id="l6049"></a>their Basilicas or Temples erected over their graves. Such was the Basilica <a id="l6050"></a>of Theodorus the Martyr as Gregory Nyssen describes &amp; the Church at Anablatha in Iudea <a id="l6051"></a>where Epiphanius tore the painted veil, &amp; the Basilica of Cassian mentioned by <a id="l6052"></a>Prudentius &amp; that of Hippolytus the Martyr at Rome mentioned by the same  Prudentius <a id="l6053"></a>&amp; those of Felix which Paulinus Bishop of Nola caused to be painted. And tho they <a id="l6054"></a>were painted only for instructing the people in the histories of the passions of the <a id="l6055"></a>Martyrs yet the painting soon begat in many of the common people a respect &amp; veneration <a id="l6056"></a>towards the very pictures.  For Austin bishop of Hippo tells us: Noli consectori <a id="l6057"></a>turbas imperitorum qui vel in ipsa vera religione superstitiosi sunt  vel <a id="l6058"></a>ita libidinibus dediti ut oblitio sint quicquid promiserint Deo. Novi multos esse <a id="l6059"></a>sepulchrorum et PICTVRARVM adoratores; novi multos esse qui luxuriosissime <a id="l6060"></a>super mortuos bibant &amp; epulas cadaveribus exhibentes super sepultos seipsos <a id="l6061"></a>sepeliant, &amp; voracitates ebrietatesque suas deputant religion. This Austin wrote <a id="l6062"></a> of <a id="l6063"></a> in the year 388  when he was at Rome being newly converted [there] <a id="l6064"></a>to the christian faith &amp; not yet returned into Afric &amp; therefore it relates to the people of Rome &amp; Italy. And how superstitious they.  <a id="l6065"></a>were appears further by what Theodoret tells us of them in the life of Simeon the pullar-Monck : <em class="underline">Aiunt Romæ, quæ est longe maxima <a id="l6066"></a>Symeonem fuisse adeo omnium ore celebratum ut in officinarum omnibus <a id="l6067"></a>vestibulis &amp; porticibus ei parras posuerint imagines hinc sibi præsidium et <a id="l6068"></a>tutelam parantes.</em>  This shews that the Romans began now to  place much <a id="l6069"></a>the same vertue &amp; power in the Images as in the reliques of saints. And it deserves <a id="l6070"></a>the more to be taken notice of because this was written  in the lifetime of Simeon &amp;  <a id="l6071"></a>when Rome was in its greatness being not yet  taken by Alaric.  For this was written in the 28<sup>th</sup> year of Symeon <a id="l6073"></a>began to fast yearly 40 days  together, which he did before he was visited by <a id="l6074"></a>Meletius Bishop of Antioch who died A. C. 381. And so it shews that the Romans <a id="l6075"></a>even before the taking of Rome by Alaric, when their city was in its <a id="l6076"></a>greatness, began to place much the  same vertue &amp; power in  Images <a id="l6077"></a>as in the reliques of Saints. And lest it should seem incredible that they <a id="l6078"></a>should place so great vertue in the Images of a man who was not <a id="l6079"></a>yet dead: historians tell you that the Emperor Theodosius himself in his war <a id="l6080"></a>against Maximus A. C. 388, placed as great vertue in the walking staff &amp; <a id="l6081"></a>hood of the liviving Monck Senuphius,  sent him by the Bishop <a id="l6082"></a>of Alexandria. The old heathen custome of offering inferiæ ( infernal <a id="l6083"></a>sacrifices) to the dead was performed by Christians not only at the  tombs of the Martyrs in their annual festivals but also at <a id="l6085"></a>at the Statue of Constantine the great erected at his Tomb.. For Theodovit mentioning <a id="l6086"></a>the great honour which was paid to the dead body of Constantine <a id="l6087"></a>the great at his funeral, adds: <em class="underline">Quod signis istis non vult credere <a id="l6088"></a>is ea intuens quæ nune ad ejus loculum et statuam geruntur <a id="l6089"></a>credat ijs quæ scripta sunt, et Domino qui ducit: Glorificantes me <a id="l6090"></a>glorificabo &amp; qui me spernunt ipsi spernentur.</em> And what honours <a id="l6091"></a> the Christians paid to Constantine at his tomb &amp; statue Philostorgius has re<a id="l6092"></a>corded:  <em class="underline">Imaginem Constantini in Prophyretica columna stantem <a id="l6093"></a>sacrificijs placent et lucernis accensis ac suffitibus honorant, <a id="l6094"></a>vota etiam faciunt ut Deo, &amp; supplicationes ad depellendas calasmi <a id="l6095"></a>tates peragunt.</em> And now this honour began to be paid to the statues <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p102v"> &lt;102v&gt; </span> of men the  Pope    brought them into Churches.  For Pope Hadrian in a letter to Charles the great <a id="l6098"></a>writes that Pope Sixtus [about <a id="l6099"></a>the year 436] built a Church to the Virgin Mary &amp; adorned it which holy Images <a id="l6100"></a>of gold in various histories. &amp;  that the Emperor Valentinian the third <a id="l6101"></a> at the request of Pope Sixtus fecit Imaginem auream cum duodecim portis <a id="l6102"></a>et Salvatore gemmis pretiosis ornatam quam voti gratia supra confessionem <a id="l6103"></a>beati Petri Apostoli posuit &amp; a tune usque hactenus apud nos ab omni<a id="l6104"></a>bus fidelibus venerantur. In the twelve Neeches were the  statues <a id="l6105"></a>of the 12 Apostles in gold as Anastasius &amp; Platina mention who tell <a id="l6106"></a>the same story. The same Sixtus placed also in the Church of S<sup>t</sup> Laurence a Silver Statue of S<sup>t</sup> <a id="l6107"></a>Lawrence weighing 200 pounds. And after the Pope &amp; the Emperor <a id="l6108"></a>had set these examples we may presume that it came into fashion <a id="l6109"></a>to set up Images in Churches. </p>
                <p id="par415">She played the Harlot before she was forgotten, worshipping dead men &amp; beginning to set up their images. <a id="l6110"></a>&amp;  her Bishop being called Oecumenical by the Council of Chalcedon or  fourth general Council &amp; <a id="l6111"></a>head of all the Churches by the Emperor Iustinian,  two years before the wars of the fourth trumpet <a id="l6112"></a>began. By  by the wars of this Trumpet &amp; the great &amp; ruin of the City Rome the Pope was quickly humpled  &amp;  his honour forgotten so that the Bishop <a id="l6113"></a>of Constantinople claimed the universall Bishopric  till the Emperor Phocas by a fresh grant restored it to <a id="l6114"></a>the Bishop of Rome. Thus she lay wast &amp; was forgotten  seventy years that is during all the wars of the <em class="underline">fourth Trump<sup>t</sup></em> <a id="l6115"></a> which began in Italy A. C. 536 &amp; ended A. C. 605 or (if you please) from the siege of Rome A. C. 507 to the grant of the <a id="l6116"></a>universal Bisopric by Phocas.</p>

            <p id="par416">By all this it should seem  that painting of Maryres  &amp; Churches began in Rome <a id="l6117"></a>being there set on foot by the Popes Silvester Marcus &amp; Iulius [&amp; Damasus.]  For I meet with no <a id="l6118"></a>other instances of  such paintings in their days. Damasus was very superstitious seeking <a id="l6119"></a>out the bodies of Martyrs &amp; adorning their  Monuments with <a id="l6120"></a>new structures  &amp; painting  &amp;  inscriptions for invocating them <a id="l6121"></a>About the time of his death or not above 5 or 10 years before the painting of Martyries &amp; <a id="l6122"></a>Basilicas began to spread into other   countries. For Paulinus B<sup>p</sup> of Nola in <a id="l6123"></a>Italy painted some Churches or Basilicas &amp; Prudentius &amp; G.

No  writer of the first seven centuries, <a id="l6141"></a>so far as I can find, mentions the painting of any Churches Oratories  or Martyries before <a id="l6142"></a>the reign of Iulian the Apostate: but soon after his reign it is mentioned by several  writers of that time. Basil in his Oration on <a id="l6144"></a>the Martyr Barlaam mentions it with approbation &amp; so far as I can observe is the first writer <a id="l6145"></a>who mentions. He mentions it by calling upon the painters of the passions of the Martyrs to <a id="l6146"></a>paint the passion of Barlaam, &amp; in the same Table to paint Christ the Iudge of their conflicts. Gre<a id="l6147"></a>gory Nyssen in his Oration S<sup>t</sup> Theod     mentions with applause the painting of the passion in his <a id="l6148"></a>Martyry &amp; speaks as if there were other Martyries painted in the same manner.

He <a id="l6151"></a>mentions also a painted veil in the Church of S.

Sozomen &amp; Ruffin tell us <a id="l6175"></a>that the Emperor Iulian applying himself to Apollo Daph<a id="l6176"></a>næus in the suburbs of Antioch &amp; pressing by many sacrifices <a id="l6177"></a>for an answer, the Oracle at length told him that the bones <a id="l6178"></a>of the Martyr Babylas hindered him from speaking. And <a id="l6179"></a>Chrysostom in his second Oration on S<sup>t</sup> Babylas made at Antioch <sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> <a id="l6182"></a>twenty years after viz<sup>t</sup> A.

And a little after: Abunde Orationi nostræ fidem faciunt quæ quoti<a id="l6187"></a>diana a martyribus miracula eduntur, magna affatim ad <a id="l6188"></a>illa hominum multitudine affluente. And in his 66<sup>th</sup> Homily <a id="l6189"></a>describing how the devils were tormented &amp; cast out by <a id="l6190"></a>the bones of the Martyrs, he adds: Ob eam causam multi <a id="l6191"></a>plerumque Reges peregre profecti sunt ut hoc spectaculo fru<a id="l6192"></a>erentur. Siquidem sanctorum martyrum Temple futuri <a id="l6193"></a>judicij vestigia et signa exhibent, dum nimirum Dæmones <a id="l6194"></a>flagris cœduntur hominesque torquentur &amp; liberantur. Vide <a id="l6195"></a>quæ Sanctorum vita functorum vis sit? And Ierome in <a id="l6196"></a>his Epitaph on Paula thus mentions the same things. Paula <sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup> <a id="l6198"></a>vidit Samariam: ibi siti sunt Eligæus &amp; Abdias Prophetæ <a id="l6199"></a>&amp; Ioannes Baptista, ubi multis intremuit consternata mira<a id="l6200"></a>culis.

This <a id="l6204"></a>was about the year 382. Eunapius a  heathen but yet a fit <a id="l6205"></a>witness of what was done in his own times, relating how the soldiers <a id="l6206"></a>delivered the heathen temples of Egypt into the hands of the <a id="l6207"></a>Monks (which was done in the year 389) rails thus  <a id="l6208"></a> at the Martyrs  as succeed in the room of the old Gods of <a id="l6209"></a>Egypt. Illi ipsi [milites] Monachos Canobi quoque collocarunt ut pro <a id="l6210"></a>Dijs qui animo cernuntur, servos et quidem  flagitiosos <a id="l6211"></a>divinis honoribus percolerent, hominum mentibus ad cultum <a id="l6212"></a>ceremoniasque obligatis. Ii namque condita et salita eorum capita <a id="l6213"></a>qui ob scelerum multitudinem a Iudicibus extremo supplicio <a id="l6214"></a>fuerant affecti pro Divis ostentabant, ijs genua submittebant <a id="l6215"></a>eos in Deorum numerum receptabant, ad illorum sepulchra <a id="l6216"></a>pulvere sordibusque conspurcati.

Thus you see the heathens <a id="l6221"></a>looked up the  Martyrs as the Gods of these new Christi<a id="l6222"></a>ans  but vilified them as the Christians did the Gods of the <a id="l6223"></a>heathens. In the year 388 Palladius went into Egypt to visit <sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup> <a id="l6224"></a>the Monasteries, &amp; telling how he visited the sepulcher of <a id="l6225"></a>Apollonius &amp; other Martyrs of Thebais who had suffered <a id="l6226"></a>under Maximinus, saith: Iis omnibus Christiani fecerunt <a id="l6227"></a>ædem unam ubi nune multæ virtutes peraguntur. Tanta <a id="l6228"></a>autem fuit viri gratia ut de ijs quæ esset precatus statim <a id="l6229"></a>exaudiretur, eum sic honorante Servatore.

By these passages it should seem that the in<a id="l6233"></a>vocation of Saints was now established in Egypt &amp; there<a id="l6234"></a>fore the miracles were as early established there as in other <a id="l6235"></a>places. For Athanasius who died in the year 371 or 372 <a id="l6236"></a>in his book de Incarnatione salutari Domini et salutari <a id="l6237"></a>ejus adventu, ascribes the like miracles to the signe of the <a id="l6238"></a>cross, saying: signo crucis omnia magica compescuntur. — Ve<a id="l6239"></a>niat qui istorum dictorum experimentur capere velit, et <a id="l6240"></a>in ipsis præstigijs dæmonum et imposturis vaticiniorum et <a id="l6241"></a>in miraculis Magiæ utatur signo crucis ab ipsis deriso, nomenque <a id="l6242"></a>Christi invocet; et videbit quomodo ejus rei metu Dæmones <a id="l6243"></a>fugiant, vaticinia conquiescant, magiæ et veneficia jaceant. <a id="l6244"></a>And to the same purpose there are several passages in the life <a id="l6245"></a>of Antony writ by Athanasius &amp; now extant in his works <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p105r"> &lt;105r&gt; </span> in Greek &amp; Latin. And Chrysostom in his Oration on the Egyptian <sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup><a id="l6247"></a>Martyrs seems to make Egypt the ringleader in these matters, <a id="l6248"></a>saying: Benedictus Deus quandoquidem ex Ægypto prodeunt Martyres, <a id="l6249"></a>ex Ægypto illa cum Deo pugnante ac in sanissima: et une impia <a id="l6250"></a>ora, unde linguæ blasphemæ, ex Ægypto Martyres habentur; non in <a id="l6251"></a>Ægypto tantum, nec in finitima vicinaque regione sed VBIQUE TER<a id="l6252"></a>RARUM.

This Oration <a id="l6274"></a>was written at Antioch while Alexandria was yet the Metropolis of the east, that is before the year 381. <a id="l6277"></a> And it was a work of some years for the Egyptians  to have distributed the miracle-working reliques of their Martyrs over all the world  as they did before this time.  Ægypt abounded most with reliques of saints keeping them embalmed upon beds even in their private houses &amp; Alexandria was eminent above all other cities for dispersing them so as on that account to acquire glory with all men &amp; manifest her <a id="l6278"></a>self to be the Metropolis of the world.  And  Antioch followed the example of  Alexandria in dispersing the reliques of the forty martyrs. And the example of Egypt &amp; Syria was soon followed by the rest of the world. <a id="l6283"></a>Monkery <a id="l6284"></a>began in Egypt &amp; Syria under the Archbishopricks of <a id="l6285"></a>Alexandria &amp; Antioch, &amp; the Moncks were they that <a id="l6286"></a>laboured most in propagating these superstitions, </p>

                <h2 id="hd36" class="cent">The fourth Trumpet</h2>
                <p id="par433">The Western Emperors were succeeded first by the Heruli &amp; <a id="l6483"></a>then by the Ostrogoths under Theodosius. And the Ostrogoths  reigned over Italy  Sicily, Rhetia, Noricum, Dalmatia Liburnia, Istria, &amp; part of  Suevia Pannonia &amp; Gallia. Whence Ennodius in a Panegyria to Theodoricus said, <em class="underline">ad limitem suum Romana regna remeasse</em>. Theodoricus reigned with great prudence  moderation &amp; felicity for 37 years together, &amp; treated the Romans with singular benevolence. Cossiadorus tells us: Theodoricus Senatum - - - superantur. And Procopius: Erat Theodoricus fama quidem Tyrannus . . . . oblectaret. In this manner Theodoricus &amp; his successor Athalaricus governed the west for 42 years, so that Evarius the historian calls them Administrators of the Western Empire &amp; other write that the western Empire was translated to them &amp; Procopius an Eye witness <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p112v"> &lt;112v&gt; </span>  introduces the Goths  thus  contending with Bellisarius. Nos Italiæ suscepto Imperio – – – <a id="l6498"></a>– – permiserunt. This was the happy state of Rome &amp; Italy under the Goths till the death of Athalaric <a id="l6499"></a>&amp; hitherto there had been no lasting wars on the northern coasts of Rome: but now brake forth <a id="l6500"></a>a northern war which  was very violent &amp; destructive &amp; lasted for  about 70 years together: 20 years between the Romans <a id="l6501"></a>&amp; Ostrogoths &amp; 50 years more between the Romans &amp;  Lombards other barbarous nations. For the Greek Emperor Iustinian <a id="l6502"></a>the next year after he had conquered the Vandals in Afric A. C. 535 sent Bellisarius with an army  against the Ostrogoths in Italy, &amp; this last war was waged almost wholy <a id="l6504"></a> in Dalmatia, Liburnia, Venetia, Lombardy, Tuscia &amp; the other parts of the <a id="l6505"></a>Empire of the Goths   which lay  northward from Rome, &amp; therefore may be accounted <a id="l6506"></a>the northern wind.   Procopius reccons that there <a id="l6507"></a>perished 1500000 people in the war between Bellisarius &amp; the Vandals &amp; much above thrice that number in the war with <a id="l6508"></a>the Ostrogoths. In taking Millain the Goths slew  300000  men &amp; sent the <a id="l6509"></a> weomen as captives to their allies the Burgundians. Roma was taken besieged &amp; retaken several times <a id="l6510"></a>&amp;  thereby her  old government by a Senate &amp; <a id="l6511"></a>Consuls ceased, her nobles were ruined, &amp; all her glory extinct &amp; after 10 years war the king<a id="l6512"></a>dom of the  Ostrogoths  fell whose Kings had been her husband &amp; her Sun illustrating as their <span class="ns">☾</span> Sun. Thus at the sounding <a id="l6513"></a>of the fourth Angel <em class="underline">the third part of the Sun was smitten &amp; the third part of <a id="l6514"></a>the Moon &amp; the third part of the Stars so as the third part of them was darkened <a id="l6515"></a> &amp; the day shone not for a third part of it &amp; the night likewise</em>, that is the Sun Moon stars <a id="l6516"></a>day &amp; night of the third part were darkened.</p>
                <p id="par434">After the ruin of the Gothic Empire, which fell in the year 552 the  remained<a id="l6517"></a>er of the Goths &amp; an army of Germans which they had called it to their assistance con<a id="l6518"></a>tinued the war for three or four years longer &amp; then  ensued the war of <a id="l6519"></a>the Heruli  who, as Anastasius tells us, <em class="underline">peremi<a id="l6520"></a>bant cunctam Italiam</em>. And after that the war of the Lombards the fiercest of all <a id="l6521"></a>the barbarians continued from the year 568 for 38 years together, <em class="underline">facta tali clade</em>, <a id="l6522"></a>saith Anastasius, <em class="underline">qualem a sæculo nullus meminit.</em> It ended in the Papacy of Sabinian <a id="l6523"></a>A. C. 605 by a lasting peace then made with the Lombards. Two or three years <a id="l6524"></a>before it ended, Gregory the great then Bishop of Rome thus mentions it: Qualiter enim et quotidianis – – – <a id="l6525"></a>– – – – valemus. The same Gregory tells us that a little before this invasion of the <a id="l6526"></a>Lombards  there was a Revelation made to one Redemtus a Bishop in these words <a id="l6527"></a>Finis venit universa carnis. Finis venit universæ carnis. Finis venit universæ <a id="l6528"></a>carnis.  This Revelation Gregory understood  of the end of the world, &amp; expounds it <a id="l6529"></a>after this manner. Post illam Prophetiam mox terribilia – – ostendit. On these <a id="l6530"></a> words of Gregory Baronius makes this Comment. At nequis - - - conflagratio <a id="l6531"></a>immineret. To all which I might add several other passages out of  the same Gregory, <a id="l6532"></a>but shall content my self with   that which follows. In one of <a id="l6533"></a>his sermons to the people he has those words: Destructœ urbes - - - - sæculum vel <a id="l6534"></a>extinctum. § And thus did the <em class="underline">Sun</em>, that is the Kings of the Barbarous nations <a id="l6535"></a><em class="underline">scorch men with great heat</em> as is exprest at the pouring out of the fourth <a id="l6536"></a>Vial. For after the Ostrogoths had treated the Italians with the greatest humani<a id="l6537"></a>ty some of the Italians sided with the Greek Emperor against the Goths: which ingratitude <a id="l6538"></a>turned the spirit of the Goths against them  &amp; the Lombards treated <a id="l6539"></a>the Italians more cruelly then the Goths had done. § <em class="underline">And men were scorched with <a id="l6540"></a>great heat &amp; blasphemed the name of God who had power over these plagues. And <a id="l6541"></a>they repented not to give him glory.</em> Blasphemy is  in all this Prophesy put for Idolatry &amp; <a id="l6542"></a>the names of blasphemy for the names of fals Gods. So Isa. 65. 7 <em class="underline">Your fathers have <a id="l6543"></a>burnt incense upon the mountains &amp; blasphemed me upon the hills.</em> Ezek 20. 27. <em class="underline">your <a id="l6544"></a>fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespas against me. For when I <a id="l6545"></a>brought them into this land, then they saw every high hill &amp;  all the thick trees &amp; they offered <a id="l6546"></a>there their sacrifices</em> - - - <em class="underline">wherefore saw unto the house of Israel, Are ye polluted after the <a id="l6547"></a>manner of your fathers? &amp; commit ye whoredom after the manner of their abominations? <a id="l6548"></a>- ye pollute your selves with all your Idols.</em> The Romans were so far from re<a id="l6549"></a>penting of their Saint-worship &amp; giving God the Glory that so soon as this plague was over <a id="l6550"></a>they set up the Images of the Saints to worship them. For in the year 607<sup>8</sup> between the years 607 &amp; 611 the Greek Emperor Phocas <a id="l6551"></a>gave the Pantheon to the Pope, &amp; there the Romans set up the Images of all the Roman Saints in <a id="l6552"></a>the room of the Images of all the heathen Gods.  And Hence foward the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p107r"> &lt;107r&gt; </span> worship of Images overspread the whole Empire by degrees, being much promoted <a id="l6553"></a>by the title of Universal Bishop which the Emperor Phocas at the same time <a id="l6554"></a>granted to the Pope.<sup>‡</sup> The  invocation of Saints is a breach of the first command<a id="l6555"></a>ment, the making of Images of Saints &amp; worshipping them is a breach of the second <a id="l6556"></a>And as the  wickedness of the saintworshippers increased <a id="l6557"></a>so God increased their punishment.

And their power was to hurt men five <a id="l6591"></a>months.</em>  <em class="underline">And they had a King over them which is the Angel of the <a id="l6592"></a>bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue Abaddon  but in the <a id="l6593"></a>Greek tongue his name is Apollyon,</em>  that is the Prophet Ma<a id="l6594"></a>homet who opened the Pit &amp; his successors the Califs  were  their <a id="l6595"></a>King as well as their Prophet, &amp; &amp; by his wars &amp; victories his name was made known to both Hebrews &amp; Greeks To the Greeks he was Apollyon a destroyer &amp; <a id="l6596"></a> to those    of Palestine over whom he reigned he was Abaddon,  the king of <a id="l6597"></a>the Nabatean Arabians  which signifies also a destroyer &amp; seems to allude  to  which extended  along the eastern side of the red sea from Petra to Albus Pagus &amp; so comprehended the regions of Mecca &amp; Medina where where the Mahometan religion had its rise. For this <a id="l6598"></a>region was called Oboda  &amp; all the kings thereof <a id="l6599"></a>were called Obodas from  Obodas the  first King who was <a id="l6600"></a>buried their &amp; deified by the natives  that is from Nabaioth by softening or omitting the first letter of his name. In allusion to this  King Oboda Mahomet &amp; his successors  the Califs <a id="l6601"></a> seem by a slight mutation to be called Abaddon the destroyer. And under this <a id="l6602"></a>King the Locusts were to  torment men five months.</p>
                <p id="par437">Mahomet pretended to be called to the Office of a Prophet in the 40<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l6603"></a>of his age A. C. 609 &amp; began then to make disciples privately &amp;  in <a id="l6604"></a>the 44<sup>th</sup> year of his age he began to manifest his vocation at Mecha  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p108r"> &lt;108r&gt; </span> &amp; set open the bottomless pit &amp; in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of his vocation A. C. 622 he <a id="l6605"></a>fled from Mecha to Medina &amp; began to arm his followers, that is <a id="l6606"></a>to bring Locusts out of the smoak. He reigned 10 years at Medina &amp; <a id="l6607"></a> after his death the Saracens entered Syria &amp; began to make war upon the Romans <a id="l6608"></a>A. C. 634 &amp; the next year in September took Damascus &amp; made <a id="l6609"></a>it the seat of their Empire.  They had two  <a id="l6610"></a>races of Califs  the first of which were of the family of Ommia <a id="l6611"></a>&amp; reigned at Damascus, the second were of the  family of the Abasids <a id="l6612"></a>&amp; A. C. 762 gave commandment for the building of Bagdad &amp; reigned there  at least <a id="l6613"></a> from the death of Almanser A. C. 775 till the year 935, when being stript of Egypt &amp; all his dominions <a id="l6614"></a>but Bagdat he surrendered his temporal government to  Mahomet a temporal <a id="l6615"></a>Prince &amp; retained only the spiritual dignity of Calif, or Patriarch. <a id="l6616"></a>This I learn out of Elmacinus &amp; Abul-Pharajius two Arabic Historians <a id="l6617"></a>Elmacinus writes thus. Anno Hegiræ 324 (qui cæpit Nov. 30. A. C. 935) <a id="l6618"></a>ad se venire jussit Califa Arradis Billa Imperatorem Muhamme<a id="l6619"></a>dem - - - - imperiales omnes faciebant.</p>
            <p id="par438">Within less then two years after this change, Bagdad, (as the <a id="l6620"></a>same Elmacinus writes) was taken  from Muhammed by one <a id="l6621"></a>Iahcamus a Turk, &amp; from that time often taken &amp; retaken being <a id="l6622"></a> in the hands sometimes of the Turks &amp; sometimes of the Sara<a id="l6623"></a>cens untill at length Togulbec took it &amp; established it to the <a id="l6624"></a>Turks. A</p>
                                    <p id="par439">So then the Kingdom of the Saracens under the Califs at <a id="l6625"></a>Damascus &amp; Bagdad lasted only from the year 635 to the year <a id="l6626"></a>936 that is 301 years  This is the  whole time that the Angel of the bottomless pit was their king after the taking of Damascus the seat of their Empire. &amp; if the last year be omitted in which <a id="l6627"></a>the Calif had lost Egypt Syria &amp; Syria &amp;  whatever belonged to the Roman Empire <a id="l6628"></a>&amp; ceased to torment the Romans the whole duration will be 300 years.  or ten prophetic months recconing 30 days to <a id="l6634"></a>a month &amp; putting a  year for a day. But because its the <a id="l6635"></a>Nature of Locusts to live but about 5 months, the Prophet for the decorum of the type &amp; because there were two successive Dynasties of this  Empire two successive imperial seats divides <a id="l6636"></a>the whole time into  five months &amp; five months, saying twice <a id="l6637"></a>that the Locusts tormented men five months;  that is  in all <a id="l6640"></a>10 months. For the repetition is not without a meaning. In this Prophesy <a id="l6641"></a>there is nothing superfluous. They reigned  something  less then five months at  Damascus  &amp; sometimes more at Bagdat: <a id="l6643"></a>five <a id="l6644"></a>months at each place more or less; in both places together ten <a id="l6645"></a>months exactly.</p>

For since this parable ends with the flight <a id="l6751"></a>of the woman into the wilderness &amp; that of the war between Michael <a id="l6752"></a>&amp; the Dragon ends also with the same flight, both these parables ending <a id="l6753"></a>at the same time must be synchronal &amp; concern the same revolution <a id="l6754"></a>of the Empire. [As Pharaohs dream was doubled  for the certainty of the <a id="l6755"></a>thing so is the prediction of this revolution of the Empire] The woman travelling <a id="l6756"></a>in birth &amp; pained to be delivered signifies the Church in affliction by a <a id="l6757"></a>great persecution which ended in the birth of a Christian kingdom &amp; therefore was Dioclesians persecution; that is, the Stars of the Greek Empire where the Persecution lasted ten years with great violence &amp; the same thing is signified by the Dragons drawing <a id="l6758"></a>the third part of the Stars of heaven &amp; casting them to the Earth. The <a id="l6759"></a> Manchild which the woman brought forth is not a single person but a kingdom as Isaias interprets the type. For the woman is a body politique &amp; the child must be a body of the same kind with the mother. And this kingdom was Christian because it was the son of the Church &amp; was to rule all nations with a rod of iron which in this prophesy  in this prophesy is the scepter of Christ <sup class="note" id="n27-ref">[27]</sup>   <a id="l6764"></a>&amp; his kingdom. The persecution began A. C. 402 &amp; This manchild was born in the <a id="l6765"></a>western part of the Empire by the victory of Constantine the <a id="l6766"></a>great over Maxentius, A. C. 412 Constantine being encouraged in that war <sup class="note" id="n28-ref">[28]</sup> <a id="l6767"></a>by a vision of a cross in the heavens with this inscription, In hoc signo <a id="l6768"></a>vinces  as historians relate. And a few years after by <a id="l6769"></a>the victory of Constantine over Licinius a heathen persecuting Emperor who <sup class="note" id="n29-ref">[29]</sup> <a id="l6770"></a> reigned in the east [&amp; continued sometimes to afflict the Christians,] the <a id="l6771"></a>Manchild was caught up to the throne of the whole Empire A. C. 323. And <a id="l6772"></a>soon after by the building of Constantinople 330, the woman received two <sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup> <a id="l6773"></a>wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness. Conceive that when the <a id="l6774"></a>manchild was caught up to God he soon vanished out of sight being to return from heaven &amp; rule all nations with a rod of iron <a id="l6775"></a>hereafter. But   but before he vanished there was a voice from heaven saying Now is come salvation &amp; strong <a id="l6776"></a></p>
                <p id="par450">The heads of the Dragon &amp; Beast being successive reigns or Dynasties <a id="l6795"></a>of the Roman Empire,  its very plain that one of those <a id="l6797"></a>heads must begin with the dethroning of the Dragon &amp; catching up <a id="l6798"></a>of the manchild to the throne &amp; another with the Beasts rising out of the sea &amp; receiving the authority &amp; throne of the Dragon: for these changes are the beginning of <a id="l6799"></a> new Dynasties, &amp; so is the first appearance of the Dragon &amp; <a id="l6800"></a>woman in travail. And these three Dynasties with those of the four horsmen which appeared at the opening of the first four seales make <a id="l6801"></a>up <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p113v-a"> &lt;113v&gt; </span> the seven dynasties  of the Empire which are  represented by <a id="l6802"></a>the heads of the Dragon. For at the opening of the fift seal there is a <a id="l6803"></a> plain description of a very gret persecution of the Church &amp; <a id="l6804"></a> &amp; at the opening of the sixt there is a plain description <a id="l6805"></a>of the overthrow of a great kingdome or Empire  by a Christian power &amp; of the kings <a id="l6806"></a>of the earth &amp; great men hiding themselves from the wrath of the <a id="l6807"></a>Lamb, because the great day of his wrath was come. And these two <a id="l6808"></a>things together answer fully to Dioclesians persecution &amp; the <a id="l6809"></a>following overthrow of the heathen Empire &amp; can answer to <a id="l6810"></a>nothing else. The fift Dynasty therefore I begin with the reign <a id="l6811"></a>of Dioclesian A. C. 284 &amp; the sixt with the victory of Constantine over <a id="l6812"></a>Licinius A. C. 373. For Dioclesian &amp; his colleagues parted the Empire between <a id="l6813"></a>them &amp; by consent reigned each in his own share &amp; this distribution <a id="l6814"></a>of the Empire made a form of government which was different from  the preceding reigns &amp; <a id="l6815"></a>lasted till the victory of Constantine over Licinius. We are therefore <a id="l6816"></a>to seek for the four first Dynasties in the times between the  <a id="l6817"></a>writings of the Prophesy in Patmus &amp; the reign of Dioclesian &amp; his <a id="l6818"></a>Colleagues.  And these are the four Horsmen which the four Beasts standing <a id="l6821"></a> towards the four <a id="l6822"></a>winds of heaven call Iohn to come &amp; see &amp; which therefore stood <a id="l6823"></a>in the regions of the Beasts, the first horsman to the east the <a id="l6824"></a>second to the west the third to the south &amp; the fourth to the <a id="l6825"></a>north. Riding signifies reigning &amp;  the four Beasts with their <a id="l6826"></a>faces  of a Lyon Ox Man &amp; Eagle allude to the armies of Israel encamped  <a id="l6827"></a>under their banners  in four bodies about the tabernacle in the wilderness, &amp; <a id="l6828"></a>in that respect a horman with his Beast  may fitly represent an <a id="l6829"></a>Emperor with his army,  &amp; thus the four horsmen with their Beasts are a very <a id="l6830"></a>fit type of four Dynasties of Emperors.</p>
            <p id="par451">Now the Dynasties of the Roman Emperors after the family of Iuluis Cæsar which preceded the writing of the Apocalyps &amp; ended in Nero were these.

After which <a id="l6841"></a>the Empire became divided into the eastern &amp; western Empires which made <a id="l6842"></a>the seventh &amp; last dynasty  there being no more changes common to both <a id="l6843"></a>Empires to make a new dynasty of the whole. And soon after  this division the division of the western <a id="l6844"></a>Empire  into ten kingdom made the eighth &amp; last dynasty <a id="l6845"></a>of that Empire, there being no more changes common to all those kingdoms <a id="l6846"></a> to make a new dynasty of that Empire. So then in <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p114r-a"> &lt;114r&gt; </span> the whole  after the  writing of this prophesy <a id="l6847"></a> there were seven successive dynasties,  &amp; no more &amp; in the whole western Empire there <a id="l6848"></a>was an eighth &amp; no more which makes good the prophesy </p>
                <p id="par456">If it be said that the words <em class="underline">Five are fallen</em> relate to Iohns time <a id="l6851"></a>&amp; therefore we are to look for five of the heads before the writing of the <a id="l6852"></a>prophesy: I answer that many things are spoken of as past or present in the <a id="l6853"></a>visions which were to come when Iohn wrote the Prophesy; as where its said that <a id="l6854"></a>the woman brought forth a manchild that she fled into the wilderness that there <a id="l6855"></a>was war in heaven, that the Dragon gave the beast his throne,  that the deadly wound of the Beast was healed that all the world wondered after the Beast <a id="l6857"></a>that the woman was drunken with the blood of Saints  &amp; the like. <a id="l6858"></a>The words; <em class="underline">five are fallen &amp; one is</em> &amp; <em class="underline">the Beast was &amp; is not &amp; yet is</em> do <a id="l6859"></a>not relate to the time of writing the Apocalyps; For the Prophesy is not <a id="l6860"></a>of things which were past before it was written. Those words  relate only <a id="l6861"></a>to one another &amp; to the  mortal wound of the Beast  &amp; signify nothing <a id="l6862"></a>more than that the Beast should cease to be for a time, being slain with <a id="l6863"></a>a sword &amp; that his heads were successive  dynasties or kings five of which <a id="l6864"></a>should reign &amp; fall before he should cease to be &amp; that he was &amp; was not <a id="l6865"></a>at one &amp; the same time in some part of  the reign of the sixt head in several respects. His life was then taken away  out <a id="l6866"></a>his body remained &amp; was ready to revive. Let it be considered that the whole <a id="l6867"></a>Prophesy is of things which were to come to pass after the writing thereof <a id="l6868"></a>&amp; the interpretation of which we have given will appeare easy &amp; natural. For <a id="l6869"></a>the little of the prophesy is <em class="underline">The Revelation of Iesus Christ which God gave unto <a id="l6870"></a>him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass.</em> And <a id="l6871"></a>in the introduction to the Prophesy of the scales &amp; trumpets Iohn heard a voice <a id="l6872"></a>which said. <em class="underline">Come up hither &amp; I will shew thee things which must be hereafter</em> <a id="l6873"></a>And in the introduction to the prophesy of the eaten book the Angel said unto <a id="l6874"></a>Iohn <em class="underline">Thou must prophesy again before many peoples &amp; nations &amp; tongues &amp; <a id="l6875"></a>kings.</em> And in the end of the Prophesy, <em class="underline">The Lord God of the holy Prophets sent <a id="l6876"></a>his Angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.</em> <a id="l6877"></a>The Epistles to the seven Churches were  admonitory as well as <a id="l6878"></a>prophetic &amp;  therefore  in the introduction to these  Epistles <a id="l6879"></a>Christ says to Iohn <em class="underline">Write the things which thou hast seen &amp; the things which <a id="l6880"></a>are &amp; the things which shall be hereafter.</em> This relates only these Epistles <a id="l6881"></a>&amp; may signify nothing more than that Iohn should write what he had <a id="l6882"></a>seen in the vision &amp; what is the present state of the churches in respect of their religion &amp; decay of their  Zeal &amp; piety &amp; what <a id="l6883"></a>should befall them hereafter if they did not repent. All the rest of the Apocalyps <a id="l6884"></a> is purely prophetick, &amp; therefore the words five <a id="l6885"></a>are fallen must be understood of five heads which fell after the writing of <a id="l6886"></a>the prophesy. Otherwise the words  These are they which came out <a id="l6887"></a>of the great tribulation &amp; I saw them which had gotten the victory over the <a id="l6888"></a>Beast <a id="l6889"></a>&amp; over his Image  stand on the sea of glass would imply <a id="l6890"></a>that the tribulation &amp; the victory were past before the writing of the prophesy <a id="l6891"></a>&amp; the Words. The Beast which was &amp; is not would imply that the <a id="l6892"></a>Beast was during the reign of five of his heads before the writing <a id="l6893"></a>of the Prophesy &amp; was not  when Iohn wrote it: an interpretation <a id="l6894"></a>which  has puzzeled interpreters.    The  Vision of the Beast with the Woman sitting <a id="l6895"></a>upon him commences not before his  ascent out of the abyss  &amp; <a id="l6896"></a>Iohn takes a prospect of him not from his own time but from the times next preceding his ascent when he lay <a id="l6897"></a>dead of his wound  &amp; was to ascend &amp; to signify that he  takes such a prospect of him he saith that the Beast the Beast <a id="l6898"></a> was &amp; is not &amp; shall ascend out of the abyss, <a id="l6899"></a> &amp; names him the Beast which was &amp; is not: a phrase of the very same signifycation with that of the Beasts  being slain with a sword &amp; reviving &amp; ascending out of the Sea. For he was before he was slain &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p114v"> &lt;114v&gt; </span> was not when he lay dead of his wound &amp; ascended after his wound was healed. § The comparing <a id="l6903"></a>of the several parts of scripture together which resemble one another &amp; adjusting those things <a id="l6904"></a>together which without straining may be adjusted  is the main Rule of interpretation. And by vertue <a id="l6905"></a>of this Rule I take it for granted till I see any good arguments to the contrary that the Beast which slew <a id="l6906"></a>the Witnesses, the Beast which was  slain with a sword &amp; the Beast which was &amp; is not &amp; Daniels fourth Beast are one &amp; <a id="l6907"></a>same Beast; that the Woman Iezabel the Woman which fled into the Wilderness &amp; the Woman sitting upon many waters in the <a id="l6908"></a>Wilderness are one &amp; the same Woman; that the prophet Balaam &amp; the Fals Prophet  &amp; the two horned Beast are the same; that the <a id="l6909"></a>seven  Trumpets seven Thunders &amp; seven Vials of wrath are the same; that the 144000 <a id="l6910"></a>sealed in their foreheads, the 144000 on mount Sion &amp; they that  had gotten the victory over the mark <a id="l6911"></a>of the Beast &amp; stood on the sea of glass are the same; that the Synagogue of Satan,  those of the twelve tribes  who were not sealed in their foreheads,  &amp; the men who received the mark of the Beast are the same, &amp; <a id="l6914"></a>that Satan who had his throne in Pergamus &amp; the Dragon that old Serpent called the <a id="l6915"></a>Devil &amp; Satan are the same.  that the great time of trouble in Daniel &amp; the great tribulation  the harvest in Matthew &amp; in the Apocalyps are the same <a id="l6919"></a>&amp; that the <a id="l6920"></a>time of trouble in Daniel,  &amp; the great tribulation &amp; the harvest in Matthew &amp;  in <a id="l6921"></a>the Apocalyps are the same, that the Beast  &amp; Dragon who are worshipped the man of sin <a id="l6922"></a>who sits in the temple of God  opposeth &amp; exalteth himself above all that is called God or worshipped &amp; shewing himself that he is a God &amp; the king in Daniel who exalts himself <a id="l6923"></a>&amp; magnifies himself above every god, are the same. And in general that the Apocalyps &amp; the many places <a id="l6924"></a>in the old  Prophets which are hinted at &amp; alluded unto in the  Apocalyps treat <a id="l6925"></a>of the same things  For by comparing the several parts <a id="l6926"></a>of Prophesy which  harmonize &amp; agree the parts compared interpret one another, &amp; the body of prophesy <a id="l6927"></a>is reduced to a greater degree of simplicity &amp; the interpretation rendered more <a id="l6928"></a>concise &amp; distinct &amp; more cleare &amp; certain.   And certainly those <a id="l6929"></a>interpretations are to be preferred which have these characters &amp; those are to be <a id="l6930"></a> rejected as tending to  uncertainty  distraction &amp; confusion  <a id="l6931"></a> which separate  what may without straining be adjusted. <a id="l6932"></a>For the  parts of Prophesy are like the separated parts of a Watch . They appear confused &amp; must be com<a id="l6933"></a>pared &amp; put together before they can be usefull, &amp; those parts are certainly to be <a id="l6934"></a>put together which fit without straining. This we have hitherto been doing &amp; now let <a id="l6935"></a> us try how this Prophesy  set together as above &amp; applied to the Roman hemisphere will answer to history in  continual order <a id="l6936"></a>of time.</p>

                <p id="par457">The Encampment described is the book of Numbers &amp; the Iews keep a tradition of their standards. Every Horsman therefore with the hors he rides upon &amp; <a id="l6938"></a>the Beast in the same region are a fit emblem of an Emperor with his Empire &amp; his army under its  standart. And thus the four horsmen with their Beasts <a id="l6939"></a>very fitly represent four  reigns or dynasties of Emperors.</p>
                <p id="par458">The fift Dynasty was of several Emperors reigning together &amp; sharing the Empire amonst them by common consent.  This Dynasty here with the reign of Dioclesian &amp; Maximianus <a id="l6940"></a> &amp; ended with the dethroning of the Dragon by the Victory of Constantine the great over Licinius,  the Dragons coming down  amongst the inhabitants of the Earth &amp; sea beginning a new dynasty Sometimes four or five Emperors reigned together. This Dynasty <a id="l6941"></a>the Romans distinguished from the reigns of former Emperors by dating  from the beginning of it an Æra called the Æra of Dioclesian &amp;  the Æra of the martyrs. For this Æra <a id="l6942"></a>commenced with the reign of Dioclesian A. C. 284. Aug. 29, &amp; was in use till the Æra of Dionysius prevailed that is for about 250 years.  Scalrier saith it is still in use among <a id="l6943"></a>the Christians of Afric &amp; Ethiopia.  This æra I consider as an  argument of the beginning of a new Dynasty, o the Romans looking upon Dioclesian as the victory of <a id="l6944"></a>this Empire. this fift Dynasty sometimes 4 or 5 Emperors reigned together. The sixt Dynasty began with the victory of Constantine over Licinius whereby the Empire was reduced to a monarchical form.  It continued in the family of Con<a id="l6945"></a>stantine till the death of  Iulian the Apostate. After Iulain reigned Iovian seven months &amp; then the Beast which had been slain with a sword reigned by a division of the Empire made between Valentinian &amp; Valens &amp; <a id="l6946"></a>rose out of the sea by another division of it between Gratian &amp; Theodosius &amp; at the death of Theodosius  received the Dragons throne <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p114r-b"> &lt;114r&gt; </span>  by which acts a seventh Dynasty commenced  gradually, which Dynasty was of the Empire divided into the Greek &amp; Latine Empires or of the Dragon &amp; Beast reigning together. And after this division <a id="l6947"></a>of the Empire there being no more changes common to both Empires to make a new Dynasty of the whole, the Dragon &amp; Beast have no more common heads then seven. <a id="l6948"></a>But Soon after this division the  Latine Empire became further divided into ten kingdoms which made a new Dynasty of that Empire called the eight &amp; of the seven &amp; this was the last dynasty <a id="l6949"></a>of the western Empire there being no more changes common to all those kingdoms to make a new dynasty.  So then in the whole Roman Empire after the writing of this Prophesy <a id="l6950"></a>there were seven successive Dynasties &amp; no more &amp; in the whole Western Empire there was an Eighth &amp; no more, which events make good the  description of the Dragon &amp; Beast.</p>

                <p id="par460">The sixt Dynasty began [with the dethroning of the old Dragon &amp; his coming down  among the inhabitants of the Earth &amp; Sea, that is, as was said, <a id="l6954"></a>with the victory of Constantine the great over Licinius whereby</p>

The four horns <a id="l7198"></a>of the golden Altar allude to the situation of the  head cities of the said four king<a id="l7199"></a>doms  Myapharekin Mosul Aleppo &amp; Iconium which  were in a quadrangle. <a id="l7200"></a>They slew the third part of men when they conquered the Greek Empire <a id="l7201"></a>&amp; took Constantinople A. C. 1453. And They began to be prepared for this purpose <a id="l7202"></a>when  Olub-Arslan began to conquer the nations upon Eufrates A. C. <a id="l7203"></a>1063. And the interval is called  a day &amp; a month &amp; a year or 391  <a id="l7204"></a>prophetic days which are years.

            <p id="par500">The Prophesy of the Apocalyps neare the beginning thereof relates chiefly to <a id="l7241"></a>the first ages of Christianity  &amp; neare the end to the  <a id="l7243"></a> last. The  first six chapters  treat very  largely of the times preceding the great Apostacy &amp; <a id="l7244"></a>the five next treat largely of the reign   of that  Apostacy &amp; rise chiefly of its fall. Then follows a repetition of the <a id="l7245"></a>whole &amp; the 12<sup>th</sup> chapter treats briefly of the  steps by  which the great Apostacy arose, the  <a id="l7246"></a>next five Chapters treat largely of its reign, the next two  treat <a id="l7247"></a>very largely of its fall &amp; the last three treat as largely of the times after its fall. <a id="l7248"></a>So then according to this method of the Prophesy the Epistles to the seven <a id="l7249"></a>Churches being introductory to this Prophesy are sermons preached by Christ to the churches of the first ages <a id="l7250"></a></p>
                <p id="par501">These Churches are literally the particular Churches  of Ephesus, Smyna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia &amp; Laodicea , &amp; the Epistles  written to <a id="l7252"></a>them as particular Churches are  to be taken in a litteral sence concerning such things as happened <a id="l7253"></a>in them  during the first ages. Particularly the false Apostles <a id="l7254"></a>in Ephasus are Cerinthus &amp; such others  as taught false doctrines  there <a id="l7255"></a> the Nicolaitans are the disciples of Nicolas one of the seven deacons who in the Age of the <a id="l7256"></a>Apostles taught fornication in a literal sense, the woman Iezebel  may be one of the  weomen of <a id="l7257"></a>Montanus who  pretended to the spirit of prophesy &amp; spread his  doctrine in Thyatira  till they overthrow the true <a id="l7258"></a>church in that city. The Martyr Antipas may be some eminent christian who <a id="l7259"></a>was  slain in  Pergamus before Iohn received this prophesy. But in a <a id="l7260"></a>mystical sense the seven churches of these cities are  joyntly &amp; severally <a id="l7261"></a>types of the church catholick &amp; signify the same thing with the seven Candlesticks &amp; seven horns <a id="l7262"></a>of the Lamb: &amp; in this respect the seven Epistles are each of them directed <a id="l7263"></a>to the Church Catholick &amp; to every  member thereof, &amp; are to be interpreted <a id="l7264"></a>in a mystical sense. And as the seven  heads of the Beast relate to seven <a id="l7265"></a>successive periods of the Roman Empire  so the seven Churches of Asia may relate to seven successive periods <a id="l7266"></a>of that Church <a id="l7267"></a>Catholick. <a id="l7268"></a>For the</p>
            <p id="par502">For the  Church Catholick  is in this Prophesy represented by <a id="l7269"></a>the  Woman in heaven cloathed with the Sun   &amp; the Moon  under her feet &amp; a crown <a id="l7270"></a>of twelve  stars upon her head  And the seven Churches are her first Metropolis &amp; continue to be her Metropolis till she flies into the wilderness &amp;  becomes the whore of Babylon. And the seven Epistles relate to seven successive states which she underwent before she changed her Metropolis <a id="l7272"></a>While she continues the Church of Christ <a id="l7273"></a>he preaches to her &amp; admonishes her by the seven Epistles : but  when <a id="l7274"></a>she flyes into the spiritually barren wilderness &amp; separates from the <a id="l7275"></a>remnant of her seed who keep the commandments of God &amp; have <a id="l7276"></a>the testimony of Iesus &amp; becomes the great Whore of Babylon; he <a id="l7277"></a>preaches to her no more.  And before she separates &amp; becomes a whore she is in seven successive states to which the seven Epistles agree She was in her first state under the heathen Emperors during the lightnings voices &amp; thundring (Apoc. 11. 19) untill she appeared in travel: in her second state  during her travel: in her third state between the birth of the Manchild &amp; &amp; her receiving two  wings of a great  Eagle; in her fourth state when she  floated in the water which the Dragon cast  out of his mouth after her; in her fift state when the Earth had swallowed up the water; in the sixt when the Dragon was wroth with her &amp; in the seven when the Dragon ceased to persecute her &amp; went to make with the remnant of her seed The first period was  during the  <a id="l7280"></a> when the Earth swallowed up the waters &amp; the people of the earth &amp; waters became <a id="l7285"></a> united, the six was when the Dragon was wroth with the woman, &amp; the <a id="l7286"></a>seventh  when the woman  was separating from the remnant of <a id="l7287"></a>her seed in order to escape into the Wilderness,  &amp; the Dragon was going from her to <a id="l7288"></a>make war with that remnant.</p>
                <span class="pagenumber" id="p119v"> &lt;119v&gt; </span>
                <p id="par503"> During these seven periods of time The Church had a great struggle <a id="l7289"></a>with the mystery of iniquity. For this mystery began to work in the Apostles <a id="l7290"></a>days &amp; was to continue working  till the  man of Sin appeared, being the mystery  <a id="l7291"></a> of of spiritual fornication or Idolatry written on the forehead of the great  Whore. And <a id="l7292"></a>because this mystery was to   overcome the Church <a id="l7293"></a> therefore Christ admonishes the Church in these Epistles <a id="l7294"></a>to contend against the  professors of this mystery calling them Nicolaitans <a id="l7295"></a>of Spiritual fornications Balaam &amp; Iezebel the fals Prophet &amp; fals prophetess who teach &amp; seduce to eat things sacrifised to Idols &amp; the Synagogue of Satan which say they are Iews &amp; are not; <a id="l7296"></a>that is, the idolatrous Church of the Devil or Dragon which say they are Christians &amp; <a id="l7297"></a>are not.  These are the Antichrist which Iohn tells us should come <a id="l7298"></a>&amp; whose forerunners  began to appear in his days,  &amp; from whose appeareance he concludes that it was the last time. His <a id="l7300"></a>meaning is that the time of the end spoken of by Daniel in which the great Antichrist <a id="l7301"></a> should rise &amp; reign was  in some respect  commenced because  his forerunners  began  to <a id="l7302"></a>appear,  &amp; once appearing were were not to cease before his coming. These Antichrists denied the father &amp; <a id="l7303"></a>the Son &amp; by consequence worshipping strange Gods in their roome were idolaters &amp; in their Eucharist  ate things sacrif. to idols &amp; so are <a id="l7304"></a>in this prophesy fitly  called Nicolaitans &amp; the Synagogue of Satan.  These <a id="l7305"></a>false teachers &amp; their followers being therefore of such dangerous consequence the Epistles to <a id="l7306"></a>the Churches are chiefly directed against them, encouraging the Churches to contend against <a id="l7307"></a>them.</p>
            <p id="par504">The first Epistle directed to the Church in Ephesus relates to the times before the <a id="l7308"></a>woman was in travel that is to the  state of the Church under the heathen Emperors <a id="l7309"></a>untill the 10<sup>th</sup> Persecution. For in this Epistle Christ saith</p>

<div>
                    <p id="par505">Heaven is here put for the Temple of heaven, that Temple which was opened in <a id="l7310"></a>heaven that the vision of the ark the Woman the Dragon &amp; Michael might be seen in <a id="l7311"></a>it. And the  thid part of the starrs of heaven which the Dragon draws with his tail or stars of the third part of heaven are the <a id="l7312"></a>seven lamps of the Temple called the seven Stars.  For this Temple is the same with that in the <a id="l7313"></a>4<sup>th</sup> chapter  in which there are seven lamps which are the seven spirits of God. And these <a id="l7314"></a>lamps are the same with those   mentioned in the beginnings of the Apocalyps which are also called the seven spirits <a id="l7315"></a>of God &amp; the seven Angels of the seven Churches.  <a id="l7316"></a>So then as the seven Candlesticks by their lamps illuminated the Temple of God in heaven <a id="l7317"></a>so the seven Churches of Asia  by their   teachers  <a id="l7318"></a>illuminated the Church Catholick of God in the first ages of  this Prophesy. For the <a id="l7319"></a>Candlesticks are those Churches, their lamps are those teachers &amp; the Temple in <a id="l7320"></a>heaven is that Church of God. The seven Churches of Asia therefore taken <a id="l7321"></a>collectively as one Church governed by Iohn, are  in this Prophesy put for the <a id="l7322"></a>Metropolis of the Church catholick of God from whence the light of the Gospel <a id="l7323"></a>went forth into all nations in the first    ages. These Churches were instructed continually by all the 12 Apostles 31 years together before they fled into Asia minor. In Asia Iohn himself <a id="l7324"></a>for above 30 years together after the death of Peter &amp; Paul continued the <a id="l7325"></a>great light of the Church catholick.   &amp; instructed the Bishops &amp; teachers <a id="l7326"></a>of the seven Churches by immediate personal conversation. From them the light went out  <a id="l7327"></a>more strongly to the Churches of Greece who were nearer &amp; spake the same language <a id="l7328"></a>more weakly to the Churches of the Latines who were remoter &amp; spake a different <a id="l7329"></a>language. And after his death the seven Churches  being more illuminated then <a id="l7330"></a>the rest continued the light of the seven Churches. The Gentiles were instructed <a id="l7331"></a>but sometimes by the preaching of Paul. He staid longer  in Ephesus (the  first <a id="l7332"></a>of the seven Churches) then in any other city  before he came to Rome. At Rome he staid only <a id="l7333"></a>four or five years in bonds &amp; Peter only one or two, &amp; the rest of the western Churches were <a id="l7334"></a>never instructed by any of the Apostles so far appears in history: but the Churches of <a id="l7335"></a>Asia were continually instructed partly by the twelve Apostles, partly by Iohn, 64 <a id="l7336"></a>years together; And therby they  became not only more knowing in the Gospel but also <a id="l7337"></a>more zealous &amp; fervent in the love of God &amp; their  neighbour, which is the live &amp; vigour </p>

                <p id="par507">In the first Epistle  Christ saith that the Church of Ephesus <a id="l7355"></a>cannot bear them which are evil &amp; hath tried them which say they are Apostles &amp; <a id="l7356"></a>are not, &amp; hath found them liars: both which characters (her purity in that she annot them which are evil &amp; her  trying fals Apostle agree best with the primitive times. <a id="l7357"></a>The fals Apostles   the fals teachers &amp; Antichrists of the first ages, such as were Simon Magus, Menander, Cervinthus, Basilides, Carpocrates, Valentinus <a id="l7358"></a>Marcion, Montanus  Tatian, Sabellius Paul of Samosat &amp;c  which being forerunners of the great Antichrist <a id="l7359"></a> Christ commends the Church of Ephasus for trying &amp; discovering them. These are <a id="l7360"></a>also the Nicolaitans whose  deeds the Church of Ephesus hated. For their  deeds as the Apostle Iohn explained in the Epistles) amounted to a denial of God &amp; Christ [&amp; setting up strange <a id="l7361"></a>Gods in their room, the worship of which was] &amp; committing spiritual fornication with  fals Gods.  A further charater of this Church was that she had <em class="underline">left her first love</em> <a id="l7363"></a>the love she had in the Apostles days. For after the death of the Apostles the Church <a id="l7364"></a>grew colder especially a little before the 10<sup>th</sup> persecution as Eusebius describes. Remember <a id="l7365"></a>therefore saith Christ from whence thou art fallen &amp; repent &amp; do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly &amp; will remove <a id="l7366"></a>thy candlestick out of its place.  Which came to pass by throwing down the Churches &amp; interdicting the worship of the Christians <a id="l7367"></a>throughout <a id="l7368"></a>all the Empire <a id="l7369"></a>in  <a id="l7372"></a>Dioclesians <a id="l7373"></a>persecuti<a id="l7374"></a>on</p>
                <p id="par508">The second Epistle relates manifestly to that  persecution   as may appear by these words. <em class="underline">And unto the Angel of the Church of Smyrna write, These <a id="l7376"></a>things saith  – – he which was dead &amp; is alive; I know thy works &amp; tribulation <a id="l7377"></a>&amp; poverty (but thou art</em> [spiritually] <em class="underline">rich) &amp; I know the blasphemy of them which say <a id="l7378"></a>they are Iews &amp; are not but are the Synagogue of Satan</em> [i.e. I know the idolatry of the  <a id="l7379"></a> disciples of the fals Apostles which now begin to be numerous &amp; which which say they are Christians &amp; are not but are the <a id="l7380"></a>Church of  Satan,]   <em class="underline">fear none of those <a id="l7381"></a>things which thou shalt suffer.

                <p id="par509">The third Epistle relates to the times next after the tenth persecution as is manifest <a id="l7386"></a>by the words.  <em class="underline">To the Angel of the Church in Pergamus write — I know <a id="l7387"></a>thy works &amp; where thou dwellest even</em> [in Pergamus] <em class="underline">where Satan's throne is</em> [that is in <a id="l7388"></a>the Greek Empire descended from the kingdom of Pergamus &amp; represented in this prophesy <a id="l7389"></a>by the great red Dragon that old Serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan] <em class="underline">&amp; thou holdest fast any name</em> <a id="l7390"></a>[during the present reign of the persecuting Greek Emperor Licinius] <em class="underline">&amp; hast <a id="l7391"></a>not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful <a id="l7392"></a>martyr, who was slain amongst you where Satan dwelleth</em> [that is in the days of the <a id="l7393"></a>tenth persecution wherein my faithful martyrs represented by Antipas were slain <a id="l7394"></a>in the Greek Empire where the Dragon reigneth &amp; where the persecution was sharpest &amp; lasted ten years.] But I have a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p121r"> &lt;121&gt; </span> <em class="underline">few things against them because thou hast there</em> [in the   Greek Empire] <a id="l7395"></a><em class="underline">them that hold the doctrine of Balaam</em> [the fals Prophet <a id="l7396"></a>aggregate of fals teachers] <em class="underline">who taught Balac</em> [the king] <em class="underline">to cast a stumbling <a id="l7397"></a>block before the children of Israel</em> [ to cause them] <a id="l7399"></a><em class="underline">to eat things sacrificed to <a id="l7400"></a>Idols &amp; to commit fornication: so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of <a id="l7401"></a>the Nicolaitans which thing I hate.

                <p id="par510">The fourth Epistle relates to the division of the Empire &amp; Church between Rome &amp; Constantinople &amp; between the sons of Constantine &amp; to the Woman growing corrupt proud, ambitious &amp; potent &amp; claiming appeals from all the world which is the universal bishopric &amp;  attempting to separating from them that opposed her &amp; thereby  beginning to fly into <a id="l7407"></a>the wilderness &amp; set up popery.

He  spake as the Dragon &amp; by excommuication made fire come down <a id="l7529"></a>from heaven upon earth in the sight of men, &amp; this fire is war  in a litteral sense is  a lighted torch thrown down in excommunications, but in a figuration one it is war the war with the Dragon made upon the remnant of the Womans seed who keep the commandments of God &amp;  in that war have the testimony of Iesus. By the influence of this B. &amp; the dictates of the Oracle which he caused to be erected to the first Beast, the Dragon made that war. <a id="l7530"></a> &amp; therein killed all that would not worship the Image  that is, dissolved their <a id="l7531"></a> bodies ecclesiastical, &amp; interdicted buying &amp; selling to all who would not receive <a id="l7532"></a>the mark or name of the beast or number of his name that is put their excommunication <a id="l7533"></a>in execution.   And so soon as this excommunication is <a id="l7537"></a> executed, all those who received not the mark of name of the Beast  <a id="l7538"></a>or number of his name stand on mount Sion with the Lamb having that name of God in their <a id="l7539"></a>foreheads &amp; being numbered with his number 144000, &amp; they are not defiled with weomen that is they are separated from the Whore, &amp; in their mouth was found no lye <a id="l7540"></a>that is they are true witnesses.

And this division is represented by the dedication of a new Temple or Taber<a id="l7567"></a>nacle with seven Candlesticks [&amp; four Beasts] for the saints in the Greek Empire &amp; by <a id="l7568"></a>the building of a new Temple with two Candlesticks for the saints in the Latin Empire.</p>
            
                <p id="par525">The dedication of a new Temple or Tabernacle  with seven Candlesticks in it, is described in the Vision of the Seven vials of <a id="l7569"></a>wrath. For there in allusion to the victory of Israel over Pharaoh the many head<a id="l7570"></a>ed Dragon &amp; to the song of Moses on the banks of the red sea, Iohn saw them that <a id="l7571"></a>had gotten the Victory over the  Beast &amp; over his Image   <a id="l7572"></a>(the  Ox Spius &amp; his Image whom the Dragon caused all men to worship in Egypt) stand on the <a id="l7573"></a>sea of glass &amp; sing the son of Moses.  And then   Iohn looked again &amp;  in allusion to the  erecting &amp; dedicating <a id="l7575"></a>the Tabernacle  Moses &amp; Temple of Soloman &amp; to the smoke with which it was filled at the dedication so that Moses  &amp; the Priests were not able to enter he saw the Temple of the Tabernacle  of the testimony in heaven  opened &amp; the seven Angels (the Priests   who had <a id="l7577"></a>newly carried in the Ark of the testimony) came out of it  being cloathed in <a id="l7578"></a>pure white linnen &amp; having their breasts girded with golden girdles which was the Priests habit. And.  the Temple <a id="l7580"></a> was filled with smoke from the glory of God, &amp; from his power &amp; no <a id="l7581"></a>man was able to enter into  it till the  sacrifices <a id="l7582"></a>of the seven days  of the dedication were ended  &amp; the seven Vials or drunk offering <a id="l7583"></a> of those sacrifices were poured out.  Now This Temple of the Tabernacle  has seven Candlesticks in it like the Tabernacle in the wilderness: for the seven angels which <a id="l7585"></a>come out of it are the   the seven spirits of God which are the <a id="l7586"></a>seven lamps of fire burning before the throne,  (Apoc 4. 5) They are the Angels of <a id="l7587"></a>the seven Churches, or lamps of the seven Candlesticks, called also the seven spirits of God &amp; <a id="l7588"></a>the seven stars in the right hand of him who walketh in the midst of the seven golden <a id="l7589"></a>Candlesticks (Apoc. 1. 20 &amp; 2. 1 &amp; 3. 1) This temple  or Tabernacle hath also <a id="l7590"></a>four Beasts about it like the Tabernacle in the Wilderness: for one of the four Beasts <a id="l7591"></a>gave unto the seven Angels seven golden Vials full of the wrath of God </p>
                <p id="par526">The building of a new Temple  with two Candlesticks is  represented by <a id="l7592"></a>Iohns measuring the Temple &amp; Altar &amp; them that worship therein  <a id="l7593"></a>(that, is the courts of the temple &amp; altar &amp; the court of the people called the weomens <a id="l7594"></a>court) &amp; leaving  out the court without the TEmple &amp; not measuring it because it is given to the Gentiles. <a id="l7595"></a>Measuring a  city or a building is a type  of building it. For when Zechary saw <a id="l7596"></a>an Angel with a measuring reed go to measure Ierusalem &amp; to see what was the  <a id="l7597"></a>breadth &amp; what the length thereof,  another Angel  gives the interpretation, saying, Ierusalem <a id="l7598"></a>shall be  inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men &amp; cattel therein <a id="l7599"></a>And when  the Babylonians had destroyed Solomon's Temple &amp;  Ezekiel  was commanded to measure  this Temple in a vision, the measuring signified  that a new Temple should be built, as is plain by many passages in that prophesy. <a id="l7602"></a>And in allusion to this vision of Ezekiel,  &amp; to the building of <a id="l7604"></a>of Zerubbabel's Temple &amp; too the prop soon after, Iohn is bid to measure the temple &amp; altar <a id="l7605"></a>&amp; them that worship therein &amp; to leave out the court without the Temple &amp; not to <a id="l7606"></a>measure it because it is given to the Gentiles. For Zerubbabel built only the <a id="l7607"></a> courts of the Temple &amp; altar &amp; the weomens court &amp;  the <a id="l7608"></a>outward court  which in Solomon's Temple had been built for the people of Israel, he left <a id="l7609"></a>unbuilt &amp; open to the Gentiles &amp; it continues unbuilt about 200 years &amp; tho it was afterwards built by Simeon Iustus &amp; Herod <a id="l7610"></a>yet it  continued open to the Gentiles &amp; was called the Gentiles court.  So then the measuring of the Temple in the Apocalyps signifies that <a id="l7612"></a>the first Temple was newly destroyed  by the Babylonians &amp; that a <a id="l7613"></a> second temple should be built in its room, whose outward court  should be given <a id="l7614"></a>to the same Babylonian gentiles who having captivated the people of God as Babylon <a id="l7615"></a>had done of old, should tread down the holy City 42 months. And in this second <a id="l7616"></a>temple there were to be two Candlesticks  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p124r"> &lt;124r&gt; </span>  standing before the God of the <a id="l7617"></a>Earth Apoc. 11. 4.</p>
                <p id="par527">Now two contemporary Temples the one with seven Candlesticks the other <a id="l7618"></a>with two Candlesticks, both built at once  must <a id="l7619"></a>signify the Churches of two contemporary kingdoms, &amp; so answer well to the true <a id="l7620"></a>Churches of God  within the  Greek &amp; Latine Empires: the <a id="l7621"></a> Temple with seven Candlesticks   signifying the Church of God within the Greek Empire <a id="l7622"></a>because the seven Churches of Asia represented by those Candlesticks were seated <a id="l7623"></a>within that Empire; &amp; the Temple with two Candlesticks signifying the <a id="l7624"></a>true Church of God within the Latin Empire because it was the second Temple <a id="l7625"></a>whose outward court was given to the Babylonians &amp; because the Beast makes war <a id="l7626"></a>upon the two witnesses represented by the two Candlesticks &amp; overcomes them <a id="l7627"></a>&amp; kills them in the street of the great city Babylon which in the form of <a id="l7628"></a>a woman reigns over him, &amp; they of the peoples &amp; kindreds &amp;  <a id="l7629"></a>tongues &amp; nations see their dead bodies lye in the street of this great city, that is, in the provinces <a id="l7630"></a>of the dominion of  the Church of Rome. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 123v &gt; </span>&amp; also because the victory of those who stand upon the sea of glass was got in the war <a id="l7631"></a>which the Dragon by the instigation of his Church the twohorned Beast made upon the remnant of the <a id="l7632"></a>womans seed when she fled from him into the wilderness, &amp; left that remnant on his kingdom<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 124r resumes &gt; </span></p>
                <p id="par528">Now for understanding what is meant by the two Candlesticks, you are to re<a id="l7633"></a>member that the nations in which the whole Church of Christ was seated <a id="l7634"></a>consisted of three parts, the eastern Empire the western Empire &amp; the northern <a id="l7635"></a>nations of Europe. The new Temple with seven Candlesticks comprehends the <a id="l7636"></a>true Christians in all the Greek Empire including Dacia.

            <p id="par533"> Towards the latter end of this <a id="l7674"></a>year Florus was made governour of  Palestine, a cruel man  <a id="l7675"></a>&amp; the next year but one in May in the 12<sup>th</sup> year of Nero the Iewish war <a id="l7676"></a>began to break out whereupon the Aposles with the Churches of the <a id="l7677"></a>circumcision fled from Iudea into other regions round about &amp; Peter <a id="l7678"></a>came with Iohn in Asia &amp; being looked upon by the Romans as the <a id="l7679"></a>head of a party of Iews with whose brethren in Iudea they were at <a id="l7680"></a>war, was banished into Patmos &amp; there wrote his Apocalyps, alluding <a id="l7681"></a>therein to the Temple as yet standing. For <span class="hspac-n" title="9 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> in his commenta<a id="l7682"></a>ry upon  the Apocalyps affirmed that it was written <a id="l7683"></a>in the day of Nero: &amp;</p>
        <p id="par534">Soon after copies of this book began to be dispersed, the Apostle Paul wrote his Epistle <a id="l7684"></a>to the Hebrews not to those in Iudea but to those who were retired into Asia <a id="l7685"></a>where the Churches were acquainted with Timothy Heb. 13. 23. And in this <a id="l7686"></a>Epistle there are some allusions to the Apocalyps: as where he saith that <a id="l7687"></a>as God rested on the seventh day from all his works so there remaineth a Σαβατισμος to the people of God, &amp; that the Word of God is quick &amp; powerfull &amp; sharper then a two edged sword, <a id="l7688"></a>that we have a cloud of Witnesses, that we look for a city which hath founda<a id="l7689"></a>tions, the city of the living God, the heavenly Ierusalem &amp; that whom the Lord loveth he chastneth.</p>
        
            <p id="par536"> After  the arrival of Peter at Rome he wrote his first Epistle to the <a id="l7699"></a>strangers of the circumcision scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappdocia, Asia, &amp; Bithymia <a id="l7700"></a> who by their new dispersion were then in heaviness through <a id="l7701"></a>manifold temptations  which he calls the fiery triall which was to try them <a id="l7702"></a>And  because the war of the Romans from which they fled  was to <a id="l7703"></a>end in the captivity &amp; desolation of Iudea  as that of the Babyloni<a id="l7704"></a>ans had done before, he dates his Letter from babylon,  finding that name given in the Apocalyps to the <a id="l7707"></a>great city upon seven hills which reigned over the kings of the <a id="l7708"></a>earth.</p>
            <p id="par537">And not long after he wrote his second Epistle to the same <a id="l7709"></a>Christians of the circumcision, &amp; therein said with relation to the <a id="l7710"></a>Apocalyps:  We have also a more sure word of Prophesy to <a id="l7711"></a>which ye shall do well that ye take heed, as to a light that shineth <a id="l7712"></a>in a dark place untill the day dawn &amp; the day-star arise in <a id="l7713"></a>your hearts: knowing this chiefly that no prophesy is of the Prophets <a id="l7714"></a>own interpretation, [You must not  expect that the interpretation <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p125v"> &lt;125v&gt; </span> from Iohn, but study it  yourselves;) for the Prophesy came <a id="l7715"></a>not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they <a id="l7716"></a>were moved by the holy Ghost. But there were fals Prophets among <a id="l7717"></a>the people, even as there shall be fals teachers among you who <a id="l7718"></a>privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that <a id="l7719"></a>bought them [the character of Antichrist] &amp; bring upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall <a id="l7720"></a>follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the truth shall be <a id="l7721"></a>blasphemed, [for all that dwell upon the earth whose names are not <a id="l7722"></a>written in the book of life shall worship the Beast &amp; he shall open his <a id="l7723"></a>mouth against God to blaspheme his name &amp; his Tabernacle &amp; those that <a id="l7724"></a>dwell in heaven] And through covetousness shall they [the Merchants of <a id="l7725"></a>the Earth] make merchandise of the saints. — But these as natural <a id="l7726"></a>bruit Beasts [the tenhorned Beast &amp; the two horned Beast] made to be <a id="l7727"></a>taken [in the battel with the army on white horses] &amp; destroyed [in the lake <a id="l7728"></a>of fire] speak evil of the things that they understood not — having <a id="l7729"></a>eyes full of an adulteress [the Whore of Babylon] — following the <a id="l7730"></a>way of  [the fals Prophet] Balaam. And a little after, he adds that <a id="l7731"></a>There shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own <a id="l7732"></a>lusts, &amp; saying; Where is the promise of his coming? For since the fathers <a id="l7733"></a>fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the <a id="l7734"></a>creation. — But beloved be not ignorant of this one thing, that  <a id="l7735"></a> one day is with the Lord as a thousand years &amp; a thou<a id="l7736"></a>sand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise as <a id="l7737"></a>some men count slackness, but is long suffering to us ward — But <a id="l7738"></a>the day of the Lord [tho it may be deffered some thousands of years which <a id="l7739"></a>with the Lord is no more than so many days, yet it] will come as a thief <a id="l7740"></a>in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away — Nevertheless we <a id="l7741"></a>according to his promis look for new heavens &amp; a new earth wherein <a id="l7742"></a>dwelleth righteousness. After this the Apostle Peter mentions the <a id="l7743"></a>Epistle of Paul to the  Hebrews in these words: even as our <a id="l7744"></a>brother Paul also, according to the wisdome given unto him, hath <a id="l7745"></a>written unto you; as also in all his Epistle speaking of these things.</p>
            <p id="par538">Iohn continued After Peter had stayed a year &amp; some months at Rome he and Paul were to govern the Churches of Asia  martyr there thirty &amp; four years longer &amp; towards the latter end of his government wrote his Gospel. <a id="l7747"></a>&amp; having now conversed long with the Greeks he wrote it freer <a id="l7748"></a>from Hebrisms then the Apocalyps which was written upon his first <a id="l7749"></a>coming from Syria, but he filled it with figurative expressions <a id="l7750"></a>taken from the Apocalyps,  which makes <a id="l7752"></a>the style more lofty then that of any of the other Gospels.</p>
            <p id="par539">While Iohn governed the Churches of Asia the Bishops of <a id="l7753"></a>Rome had no authority over them. He was not universal Bishop <a id="l7754"></a>in those days. The Churches of Asia being long under the <a id="l7755"></a>government of Iohn &amp; his disciples &amp; having the scriptures in their own tongue <a id="l7756"></a>were the best instructed of any of the Churches. Among these disciples <a id="l7757"></a>were Papias &amp; Polycarp the first of which  believed that the saints should rise from the dead &amp; reign with  Christ a thousand years before the general <a id="l7759"></a>Iudgment as also did Iustin Martyr &amp; Irenæus &amp; therefore  the Apocalyps  was received in the Churches in their days; the other was  one of the most celebrated fathers of the primitive Church <a id="l7763"></a>next after the Apostles, &amp; was martyred about 66 years after <a id="l7764"></a>the death of Iohn &amp; so was Iustin  the next year.. And hitherto the primitive Church continued <a id="l7765"></a>in its purity, insomuch that Hegesippus about eight years before the <a id="l7766"></a>death of Polycorp coming from Syria to Rome &amp; conversing with the <a id="l7767"></a>Churches in his way, found them all agree in faith. </p>

This <a id="l7778"></a>mystery worked also in those who distinguished between Iesus &amp; Christ, <a id="l7779"></a>making Iesus a mere man  born of the Virgin Mary, &amp; Christ the son of God  <a id="l7780"></a>the saviour of the world an immortal spirit who descended upon Iesus in his baptism dwelt in  him &amp; did the miracles, but upon his <a id="l7781"></a>being apprehended &amp; brought before Pilate forsook him,  which made him <a id="l7782"></a>cry out on the cross my God, my God why hast thou forsaken me.  In rela<a id="l7783"></a>tion to his opinion Iohn saith Little children it is the last time: &amp; as ye have heard that Antichrist shall  come, even now there are many Antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time — Who is a liar but he that denieth that <a id="l7784"></a>Iesus is the Christ. He is Antichrist that denieth the father &amp; the <a id="l7785"></a>son. Whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father. — <a id="l7786"></a>— Every spirit that confesseth not that Iesus Christ is come in the <a id="l7787"></a>flesh is not of God. And this is that spirit of Antichrist whereof ye <a id="l7788"></a>have heard that is should come, &amp; even now  already it is in the <a id="l7789"></a>world. 1 Iohn 2. 13, 22 &amp; 4. 3.</p>
            <p id="par541">And yet the mystery of iniquity began to work in the Apostles day <a id="l7790"></a>&amp; was to work untill that which hindred the rise of its dominion (the <a id="l7791"></a>heathen Roman Empire) should be taken out of the way, &amp; then he was to <a id="l7792"></a>rise up with power &amp; be revealed. This mystery began to work in Simon <a id="l7793"></a>Magus.  He laid the foundation of  Sabellianism by teaching that <a id="l7794"></a>the supreme God appeared in the person of the father among the  <a id="l7795"></a>Samaritans, in that of the son among the Iews &amp; in that of the Holy <a id="l7796"></a>Ghost among other nations. He said that he himself was that God &amp; <a id="l7797"></a>emitted other powers, &amp; that his Concubine Helena was the first <a id="l7798"></a> conception of his mind called Ennoia &amp; that she was the mother <a id="l7799"></a>of Archangels &amp; Angels &amp; powers &amp; came down from heaven &amp; passed into <a id="l7800"></a>the bodies of various weomen amongst whom were Helena the Greek <a id="l7801"></a>&amp; Helena his concubine, &amp; that the world was created by Angels &amp; <a id="l7802"></a>that they were to be adored as mediators bewteen God &amp; Man, &amp; <a id="l7803"></a>that there would be no resurrection of the body,  but the soul <a id="l7804"></a>was immortal &amp; passed from body to body, &amp; that men might live as <a id="l7805"></a>they pleased, being saved not by their works, but by his favour, &amp; <a id="l7806"></a>that weomen might be common. And that his Concubine Helena was <a id="l7807"></a>the lost sheep, &amp; he came down from heaven to save her in the <a id="l7808"></a>first place &amp; deliver her from the tyranny of the Angels who kept her <a id="l7809"></a>here below  in bonds. For the Egyptians &amp; Greeks who taught the <a id="l7810"></a>transmigration of souls feigned that they were emitted from the supreme <a id="l7811"></a>Being, came down from above, passed into the bodys of   men &amp; <a id="l7812"></a>weomen &amp; other creatures &amp; at length after a long circulation through <a id="l7813"></a>various  bodies &amp; states, returned up into  the supreme being &amp; <a id="l7814"></a>were received into the state in which they were in him before their emission <a id="l7815"></a>from him. And this was the foundation of the  idolatry of the <a id="l7816"></a>old Egyptians who  worshiped  their dead kings &amp; Heros in the <a id="l7817"></a>shape of various animals &amp; feigned that their  souls <a id="l7818"></a>passed into those animals &amp; might be worshipped as Gods because they came <a id="l7819"></a>originally from the substance of the supreme God. This Philosophy the <a id="l7820"></a> residing in Egypt borrowed from the Egyptians &amp; brought into their Cababa, feigning many chief emissions from <a id="l7821"></a>the supreme God whom they called sephiroths &amp; many others from things <a id="l7822"></a>the  last of which were the souls of men. And if the same kind was <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p126v"> &lt;126v&gt; </span> the Philosophy of Simon, who made Ennoia to be the first emission from <a id="l7823"></a>himself.

And as ye have heard that Antichrist <a id="l7847"></a>should come &amp; even now there are many Antichrists whereby we <a id="l7848"></a>know that it is the last time. — Who is a liar but he that <a id="l7849"></a>denieth that Iesus is the Christ.

And they <a id="l7931"></a>sung - - - reign on the earth. By their falling down before the Lamb  in the <a id="l7932"></a>Temple with this song [&amp; with the prayers of the saints) they worship him with religious <a id="l7933"></a>worship, as he was a mortal man raised from the dead the Lamb of God who was <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p127v"> &lt;127v&gt; </span> slain for us &amp; redeemed us with his blood. Because he  humbled himself to death <a id="l7934"></a>even the death of the cross therefore God the father exalted him &amp; gave him a name <a id="l7935"></a>above every name that at the name of Iesus every knee should bow, that is that all <a id="l7936"></a>men should worship him  with religious worship as he was a man who was slain <a id="l7937"></a> &amp; had reemed us with his blood. And I heard, saith Iohn, the voice of many <a id="l7938"></a>Angels – – unto the Lamb for ever &amp; ever. Unto  God &amp; the king the God of Israel who  created <a id="l7939"></a>all things &amp; whom  Israel worshipped as sitting upon his throne between the Cherubims <a id="l7940"></a>&amp; unto the Lamb of God who was sacrificed  at the Altar to the God of Israel, the king who was slain for us <a id="l7941"></a>&amp; redeemed us with his blood, &amp; made us kings &amp; Priests under him. And this was the <a id="l7942"></a>true worship of God &amp; Christ in the times of the primitive Church.</p>

        <p id="par555">Daniels three first Beasts had their lives prolonged to the end of <a id="l8024"></a>the world after their dominions were taken away. And the third &amp; fourth <a id="l8025"></a>Beast of Daniel are the same with the Dragon &amp; ten horned Beast of <a id="l8026"></a>Iohn; but with this difference, that Iohn puts the Dragon for the whole <a id="l8027"></a>Roman Empire while it continued entire, &amp;  considers not the Beast <a id="l8028"></a>till the Empire became divided: &amp; then he puts the Dragon for the Empire <a id="l8029"></a>of the Greeks &amp; the Beast for the Empire of the Latines. And hence it <a id="l8030"></a>is that the Dragon &amp; Beast have common heads &amp; common horns but <a id="l8031"></a> the Dragon hath crowns <a id="l8033"></a>upon heads &amp; not upon his horns because the horns received not power <a id="l8034"></a>as kings before they  &amp; the Beast were separated from the Dragon <a id="l8035"></a>&amp; the Beast had crowns upon his horns &amp; not upon his heads because he <a id="l8036"></a>reigned not before the rise of the seventh head,  &amp; then  he reigned in <a id="l8037"></a>his horns. The heads are seven successive kings. Four of them were the four <a id="l8038"></a>horsmen which appeared at the opening of the  first four <a id="l8039"></a>seals. In the latter end of the sixt head or seale considered as present in the visions <a id="l8040"></a>its said that five of the seven kings <em class="underline">were fallen, &amp; one was, &amp; another was not come, &amp; <a id="l8041"></a>the Beast that was &amp; is not</em> (being wounded to death with a sword) <em class="underline">he is the eighth <a id="l8042"></a>&amp; of the seven</em>.

And therefore the checking <a id="l8153"></a>of these wars  by Gration &amp; Theodosius for a time is very fitly represented by the <a id="l8154"></a>holding of the winds   that they should not hurt the earth &amp; sea till after a certain time.</p>
            <p id="par569">For before the end of the year 380 the Empire was quieted in all places &amp;  remained quiet from <a id="l8155"></a>invasions till the death of Theodosius,  this Emperor continues all his reign to check the barbarous nations &amp; keept them out by force  as Pacatus in his Panegyric above which he spake to the <a id="l8156"></a>Emperor Theodosius himself a little after  his victory  over the Tyrant Maximus A. C. <a id="l8157"></a>388  thus describes Miremur – – – quasi amica si serviat.  <a id="l8158"></a>Thus for Pacatus.

But this great warrior <a id="l8164"></a>being succeeded by children  <a id="l8167"></a>again  For Theodon<a id="l8169"></a>  &amp; leaving  his elder son Arcadius Emperor of the east under the tuition <a id="l8170"></a>of Ruffin &amp; his younger son Honorius Emperor of the West under the tuition <a id="l8171"></a>of Stilico;  these Tutors turned traytors  <a id="l8172"></a>&amp; conspired with the Barabrians thinking by their assistance to get the Empires to them<a id="l8173"></a>selves. And first Ruffin called  into the eastern Empire the <a id="l8174"></a> neighbouring barbarous nations  who harrassed <a id="l8175"></a>all that Empire for about 12 years together &amp; shook it with incredible violence &amp; <a id="l8176"></a>then  Stilico called  into the western Empire the rest of the barbarous nations who ruined <a id="l8177"></a>that Empire breaking it into ten kingdoms. And these wars the Romans <a id="l8178"></a>looked upon as the effect of the former war wherein Valens perished <a id="l8179"></a>&amp; somtimes dated them from the beginning of that  with the Goths as if  Theodosius had not put a full end to that war but only checkt it during his warlike reign, the barabrous nations lying ready to pursue their hostilities  so soon as the restraint should be taken off.  <a id="l8180"></a>  as if <a id="l8182"></a>  Which I note because it is the charater of the winds. <a id="l8186"></a>They were focibly held that they should not hurt the earth &amp; Sea (or Eastern &amp; Western Empires) till after a <a id="l8187"></a>certain time,  &amp;  continued ready to blow  upon them so soon as the restrain <a id="l8189"></a>should be taken off. By these winds I understand not civil wars but forreign invasions <a id="l8190"></a>such  winds as were held at the four corners  of the earth or borders of the em<a id="l8191"></a>pire &amp; blew upon it from thence.</p>

                <p id="par574">The Epistle to the Angels of the seven Churches of Asia  (that is <a id="l8216"></a>to their Bishops) are seven admonitions to the Churches from the time <a id="l8217"></a>that they  left their first love &amp; began to decay &amp; grow <a id="l8218"></a>cold untill the time that  Christ spewed them  out of his mouth. For at the end of every Epistle is added <a id="l8220"></a><em class="underline">He hath an ear let him heare what the spirit saith unto the <a id="l8221"></a>Churches</em>, &amp; therefore every Epistle hath reference to  all the <a id="l8222"></a>Churches. The first relates to the time when they  began to leave their first <a id="l8223"></a>love, which was in the third Century &amp; especially after the per<a id="l8224"></a>secution of Decius, as Eusebius describes in his Ecclesiastical History <a id="l8225"></a>l. 8 c. 1. The second relates to the time when they had tribulation <a id="l8226"></a>ten days that is  in the Persecution of Decius which lasted ten <a id="l8227"></a>years. The third relates to the time when the doctrine of the <a id="l8228"></a>Nicolaitans began to creep into the Churches &amp; the Prophets of the <a id="l8229"></a>Nicolaitans taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the chil<a id="l8230"></a>dren of Israel. The fourth relates to the time when the woman <a id="l8231"></a>Iezabel began to call her self a Prophetess that is to usurp divine authority over the Churches &amp; to teach the people to eat things sacrificed to <a id="l8232"></a>the idols of the Nicolaitans. The fift relates to the times <a id="l8233"></a>when the Church flourished  outwardly  having  a <a id="l8234"></a>name that she lived, but being dead. The sixt relates to the <a id="l8235"></a>times when the Church was in trouble,  &amp; <a id="l8236"></a>kept the word of Christ's patience &amp; denyed not his name which was in the reign of Iulian the Apostate, &amp; had <a id="l8237"></a>an open door set before her, a door which Christ opened with the <a id="l8238"></a>key of David. The seventh relates to the times when the  Churches of Asia <a id="l8239"></a>were grown lukewarm  &amp; notwithstanding these seven admonitions continued luke-warm till Christ spewed them out of his mouth. </p>
                <p id="par575">After this Introduction to the Prophesy Iohn saw a door opened in the Temple <a id="l8244"></a>on Mount Sion &amp; was called up thither &amp; a throne appeared  is the most holy above the Ark, &amp; one sat upon the throne <a id="l8246"></a>with a rainbow about him &amp; round about the throne were four &amp; <a id="l8247"></a>twenty  seats (the chambers of the four &amp; twenty Princes of the <a id="l8248"></a>Priests) &amp; upon the seats were four &amp; twenty elders in white <a id="l8249"></a>raiment with crowns of gold on their heads. And by reason of the <a id="l8250"></a>sacrifices burning on the great altar &amp; the musick of the Temple <a id="l8251"></a>at those sacrifices  there seemed to proceed out of the throne <a id="l8252"></a>lightnings &amp; thundrings &amp; voices. And there were seven lamps of <a id="l8253"></a>fire burning in the holy place before the throne, which represent the <a id="l8254"></a>seven spirits of God. And before the throne was a brazen sea <a id="l8255"></a>made of the looking-glasses of the weomen &amp; filled with water <a id="l8256"></a>clear as crystal. And while Iohn stood in the eastern gate of the <a id="l8257"></a>great court of the Temple there appeared in the four sides of <a id="l8258"></a>the great court  before &amp; behind throne as it were in the <a id="l8259"></a>midst thereof &amp; on either side of the throne four Beasts full <a id="l8260"></a>of eyes to represent the multitudes of people in the four sides of <a id="l8261"></a>that court. And the first Beast was like a  Lion &amp; the second <a id="l8262"></a>Beast like a calf &amp; the third Beast had a face as a man <a id="l8263"></a>&amp; the fourth Beast  was like a flying eagle, in allusion to <a id="l8264"></a>the four standards of the people of Israel encamped in the <a id="l8265"></a>wilderness in four squadrons on the four sides of the Taberna<a id="l8266"></a>cle: which standards, as the Iews tell us, were in these shapes. And the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p133r"> &lt;133r&gt; </span> four Beasts had each of them six wings, &amp; they were full of eyes <a id="l8267"></a>under the wings. And (like the Seraphins in Isaiah's vision chap. vi) <a id="l8268"></a>they rest not day &amp; night (or at morning &amp; evening sacrifice, saying <a id="l8269"></a>Holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was &amp; is &amp; is to come. And <a id="l8270"></a>when those Beasts give glory &amp; honour &amp; thanks to him that sat on <a id="l8271"></a>the throne to him that liveth for ever &amp; ever, the four &amp; twenty elders <a id="l8272"></a>[go into the holy place &amp;] fall down before him that sat on the throne <a id="l8273"></a>&amp; worship him that liveth for ever &amp; ever &amp; cast their crowns before <a id="l8274"></a>the Throne saying, Thou art worthy ô Lord to receive glory &amp; ho<a id="l8275"></a>nour &amp; power: for thou hast created all things &amp; for thy pleasure <a id="l8276"></a>they are &amp; were created. And this is the Christian worship of <a id="l8277"></a>God the father delineated under the form of  his worship <a id="l8278"></a>in the Temple among the Iews. For his worship is the same in <a id="l8279"></a>both cases.</p>
                <p id="par576">And I saw, saith Iohn in the right hand of him who sat upon the <a id="l8280"></a>Throne a Book written within &amp; on the back side &amp; sealed with seven <a id="l8281"></a>seales, alluding to the book of the Law laid up in the right side <a id="l8282"></a>of the Ark &amp; to the Book which Daniel had sealed  &amp;  conteining the <a id="l8283"></a>revelation of Iesus Christ which God gave unto him. And none was <a id="l8284"></a>foundworthy in heaven or earth to open the book &amp; read thereon till <a id="l8285"></a>the Lamb appeared as it had been slain at the foot of the great <a id="l8286"></a>altar having seven horns &amp; seven eyes which are the seven spirits <a id="l8287"></a>of God sent forth into all the earth. And he came &amp; took the book <a id="l8288"></a>out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when <a id="l8289"></a>he had taken the book the four Beasts &amp; four &amp; twenty Elders, fell <a id="l8290"></a>down before the Lamb having every one of them harps &amp; golden vialls <a id="l8291"></a>full of odours which are the prayers of the saints. And they sung a new <a id="l8292"></a>son saying Thou art worthy to  take the book &amp; to open the <a id="l8293"></a>seals thereof for thou wast slain &amp; hast redeemed us to God by they <a id="l8294"></a>blood out of every kindred &amp; tongue &amp; people  &amp; nation: And hast <a id="l8295"></a>made us unto our God Kings &amp; Priests &amp; we shall reign on the earth. <a id="l8296"></a>And Iohn heard the voice of many Angels round about the throne &amp; the <a id="l8297"></a>Beasts &amp; the Elders &amp; the number of them was ten thousand times ten <a id="l8298"></a>thousand &amp; thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the <a id="l8299"></a>Lamb that was slain to receive power &amp; riches &amp; wisdome &amp; strength &amp; <a id="l8300"></a>honour &amp; glory &amp; blessing. And ever creature which is in heaven &amp; <a id="l8301"></a>on the earth &amp; under the earth &amp; such as are in hte sea, &amp; all <a id="l8302"></a>that are in them heard I saying: Blessing &amp; honour &amp; glory &amp; <a id="l8303"></a>power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne &amp; unto the Lamb <a id="l8304"></a>&amp; unto the Lamb for ever &amp; ever: to God because he created all <a id="l8305"></a>things &amp; to the Lamb because he redeemed us with his blood. And the <a id="l8306"></a>four Beasts said Amen, &amp; the four &amp; twenty Elders fell down [in the <a id="l8307"></a>most Holy place, &amp; worshipped him that liveth for ever &amp; ever. <a id="l8308"></a>And this is the worship which <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">{Christians are authorised to give}</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">the primitive church gave</span></span> to <a id="l8309"></a>Iesus Christ the man who was slain for us &amp; redeemed us with his <a id="l8310"></a>blood.</p>
            <p id="par577">Upon the tenth day of the seventh month the High Priest <a id="l8311"></a>read the Law of Moses to the people &amp; for this end he studied <a id="l8312"></a>the book seven days together that is upon the fourth, <a id="l8313"></a>fift six seventh eighth ninth days of the  seventh <a id="l8314"></a>month &amp; in allusion to this custome to the Lamb opens the seven <a id="l8315"></a>seales of the book successively. And when he opened the seventh <a id="l8316"></a>seal there was silence in heaven for half an hour, viz<sup>t</sup> during <a id="l8317"></a>the reading of the Law.</p>
                <p id="par578">Upon the fifteenth day of the seventh month began the <a id="l8318"></a>feast of Tabernacles  &amp; this feast <a id="l8319"></a>was kept seven days together with great sacrifices. And at the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p133v"> &lt;133v&gt; </span> sacrifices the Priests  sounded the Trumpets &amp; poured <a id="l8320"></a>out the drink offerings &amp; the Levites sang loud &amp; played upon <a id="l8321"></a>instruments of musick. And in allusion  to this the opening <a id="l8322"></a>of the seventh seal is followed with the sounding of seven <a id="l8323"></a>Trumpets  to seven warrs in which the slaughtering of men are <a id="l8324"></a> considered as sacrifices, &amp; at these sacrifices seven thunders utter <a id="l8325"></a>their voices, (the voices of the Levites singing) &amp; seven Vials of wrath are poured out as drink offerings. The seven <a id="l8326"></a>Trumpets the seven thunders &amp; the seven vialls are therefore <a id="l8327"></a>contemporary to one another.</p>
            <p id="par579">At the time of opening the seventh seale when there was <a id="l8328"></a>silence in heaven for half an hour, the Angels of the first four <a id="l8329"></a>Trumpets held the four winds of the earth that they should <a id="l8330"></a>not hurt the earth &amp; the sea &amp; the trees (as was done at the <a id="l8331"></a>sounding of the two first Trumpets) untill the servants of God were <a id="l8332"></a>sealed in their foreheads. And there were 144000 sealed out of <a id="l8333"></a>all twelve tribes of Israel. And when these were sealed with <a id="l8334"></a>the seale of God, it is to be understood that the rest were <a id="l8335"></a>marked with the mark or name of the Beast: the two horned <a id="l8336"></a>Beast at that time causing all both small &amp; great rich &amp; poor <a id="l8337"></a>free &amp; bond to receive the marks of the Beast in their right <a id="l8338"></a>hand or in their foreheads. For as soon as this was done the <a id="l8339"></a>144000 appeared on Mount Sion with the name of God in their <a id="l8340"></a>foreheads. And the same thing is represented by measuring the Tem<a id="l8341"></a>ple &amp; Altar &amp; them that dwell therin, that is court of the Temple &amp; <a id="l8342"></a>the court of the Altar &amp; the new court or weomens &amp; leaving out <a id="l8343"></a>the great court for the gentiles. And therefore all this marking &amp; <a id="l8344"></a>sealing &amp; numbring &amp; measuring was done between the opening of <a id="l8345"></a>the seventh seal &amp; the sounding of the first Trumpet. These <a id="l8346"></a>144000 sealed ones are the two Witnesses, &amp; stand on the sea <a id="l8347"></a>of glass before the seven Angels begin to pour out the vials of wrath. The rest have the mark of the Beast.</p>
            <p id="par580">The prophesy of the seals &amp; trumpets ends with the sound<a id="l8348"></a>ing of the seventh Trumpet &amp; then is repeated, &amp; the repeti<a id="l8349"></a>tion beginns with the words And the temple of God was open<a id="l8350"></a>ed in heaven, &amp; ends with the Book.</p>

For when the <a id="l8356"></a>Temple was opened to the morning sacrifice &amp; Iohn saw therein a Throne <a id="l8357"></a>&amp; one sitting thereon, he saw also seven lamps of fire burning before <a id="l8358"></a>the throne which were the seven spirits of God; the same spirits with <a id="l8359"></a>those represented by the seven starrs;   There were therefore seven lamps with their Candlesticks <a id="l8361"></a>in the first Temple but in the second Temple there remained <a id="l8362"></a>only two Candlesticks  The seven Candlesticks are <a id="l8363"></a>the seven Churches of Asia &amp; their lamps illuminated the  the primitive Church  worshipping in the first <a id="l8365"></a>temple.

Five of the <a id="l8368"></a>seven Churches of Asia were found found fault with &amp; exhorted <a id="l8369"></a>to repent &amp; threatned if they did not repent. These were the <a id="l8370"></a>Churches of Ephesus Pergamus Thyatira Sardis &amp; Laodicea. These <a id="l8371"></a>were removed  &amp; spewed out of Christs mouth for not repent<a id="l8372"></a>ing.

These <a id="l8374"></a>had done nothing for which they deserved to be removed &amp; therefore they <a id="l8375"></a>are  continued down into the second Temple in their state of <a id="l8376"></a>affliction &amp; poverty &amp; tribulation &amp; there are called the two <a id="l8377"></a>candlesticks &amp; the two Olive trees &amp; the two witnesses. For the <a id="l8378"></a>Church of God  did not cease at the fall of the first Temple but <a id="l8379"></a>was propagated down into the  second temple <a id="l8380"></a>without interruption, &amp; this was done by representing Churches by <a id="l8381"></a>Candlesticks &amp; continuing some of the Candlesticks down into the <a id="l8382"></a>second Temple.</p>

For the High Priest is the son of man in the habit of the High Priest <a id="l8393"></a>the seven Candlesticks represent the seven Churches of Asia &amp; the seven lamps <a id="l8394"></a>represent the Angels  or Presidents of those Churches, &amp; the woman in heaven  is the primitive Church <a id="l8395"></a>catholick, till the saints are sealed with the seale of God &amp;  become <a id="l8396"></a>the two witnesses,   &amp; the rest receive the mark <a id="l8397"></a>of the Beast &amp; worship his Image &amp;  fly in to a state of spiritual barren<a id="l8398"></a>ness represented by the wildernes of Arabia desert &amp; with relation to their form of Church <a id="l8399"></a>government are united into one body or Church represented by a woman living delicious<a id="l8400"></a>ly at Babylon, while the two witnesses prophesy in sackcloth in the streets of <a id="l8401"></a>that great city. The two witnesses are called the two Candlesticks to signify <a id="l8402"></a>that they are rpresented by two of the seven Candlesticks or Churches, the <a id="l8403"></a>Churches of Smyrna &amp; Philadelphia who were under persecution &amp; were faultless <a id="l8404"></a>&amp; the other five &amp;c] Whence it follows that the  lamps of the seven <a id="l8405"></a>Churches of Asia were the great light wherewith the primitive church <a id="l8406"></a>Catholick was illuminated.</p>
            <p id="par583">After the lamps are dressed Iohn is  saw the eastern door of the Temple opened, &amp;  was called <a id="l8408"></a>up to the morning sacrifice, &amp; there saw a throne &amp; one sitting upon <a id="l8409"></a>it representing God sitting the Ark, &amp;  he looked in colour like <a id="l8410"></a>a jasper &amp; sardine stone the colour of the people of the Iews, &amp; round the <a id="l8411"></a>throne were 24 seats with 24 Elders upon them crowned, viz<sup>t</sup> the chambers of <a id="l8412"></a>the  Prices of the 24 houses orders of the Priests on either side of the Priests <a id="l8413"></a>court. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings &amp; thundrings &amp; voyces; <a id="l8414"></a>the flashes of the fire on the Altar &amp; the musick &amp; singing before the <a id="l8415"></a>Altar appearing to Iohn at the eastern gate of the Temple as coming <a id="l8416"></a>from the Throne. And there appeared the seven lamps which had been <a id="l8417"></a>newly dressed &amp; represent the seven spirits of God &amp; Angels of the seven <a id="l8418"></a>churches. And before throne was  a sea of glass, the great brazen sea <a id="l8419"></a> of water clear as glass. And over against <a id="l8420"></a>the midst of the throne before &amp; behind &amp; in the circit on either side the throne <a id="l8421"></a>were four Beasts full of eyes before &amp; behind to represent four bodies of men on the <a id="l8422"></a>four sides of the Throne, that is, the people of Israel in the four sides of <a id="l8423"></a>the great court. And the Beasts were like a Lyon, or Calf, a Man <a id="l8424"></a>&amp; a flying Eagle, these being the standards of the four squa<a id="l8425"></a>drons of the people of Israel on the four sides of the Tabernacle <a id="l8426"></a>in the wilderness. And the four Beasts &amp; 24 Elders   day &amp; <a id="l8427"></a>night or at the morning &amp; evening sacrifices) worhsip God without <a id="l8428"></a>ceasing. And in the right hand of him that sat on the throne was a <a id="l8429"></a>[book (the book of the law in the side &amp; written within (with a sevenfold Prophesy) &amp; on the backside (with an interpre<a id="l8430"></a>tation thereof) &amp; sealed with seven] (the Book of the law in the side <a id="l8431"></a>of the Ark appearing as it were in  his right hand) written <a id="l8432"></a>within &amp; on the back side (of every leaf) &amp; sealed with seven seals <a id="l8433"></a>And none was found worthy to open the book till the Lamb of God appeared <a id="l8434"></a>as it were slain in the midst of the Elders &amp; Beasts that is at the foot of the <a id="l8435"></a>altar,  in the morning sacrifice. And then the Beasts &amp; Elders wor<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p134v"> &lt;134v&gt; </span>ship God &amp; the Lamb who was slain.</p>
            <p id="par584">These visions allude to the feast of the seventh month, &amp; upon <a id="l8436"></a>the tenth day of the month the High Priest read  the Law to the <a id="l8437"></a>people &amp; in order thereunto studied the book of the Law seven days <a id="l8438"></a>together beginning upon the fourth day of the month. And in allusion <a id="l8439"></a>to this the Lamb opens the seven seals in order: &amp; upon the tenth day <a id="l8440"></a>of the month which was the great fast of the Iews he opens the seventh <a id="l8441"></a>seale wherewith the great Apostacy begins.</p>

            <p id="par586"> All Daniels four Beasts are still in being &amp; their lives are still <a id="l8484"></a>prolonged: but the dominions of the three first  were long since taken away.  The Ram reigned in the Medes &amp; Persians <a id="l8487"></a>from the days of Cyasceres to those of Alexander the great <a id="l8488"></a>that is, all the time of the two first Monarchies, &amp; the He Goat <a id="l8489"></a>reigned all the time of the two last  he reigned first in his great horn &amp; then in his four horns during all the times of the third Beast &amp; when their <a id="l8491"></a>dominion was taken away, he reigned in his little horn in the time <a id="l8492"></a>of the fourth Beast &amp; grew mighty but not by his own power <a id="l8493"></a> The nations which composed the body of the third Beast do still <a id="l8494"></a>compose it, &amp; the He Goat still represents all those nations on this <a id="l8495"></a>side of Euphrates. [He reigned in his four horns (or some of them) till <a id="l8496"></a>the fourth Beast by conquering Macedon  Asia <a id="l8497"></a>minor Syria &amp; Egypt took away their dominion. And in the latter time <a id="l8498"></a>of their kingdom the little horn rose up] And the great red Dragon in the <a id="l8499"></a>Apocalyps  represents the same nations &amp; signifies the same <a id="l8500"></a>thing with the He Goat reigning in his last horn &amp; therefore is said to <a id="l8501"></a>have his throne in Pergamus, a city of the Greek Empire. And the <a id="l8502"></a>ten horned Beast in the Apocalyps signifies the same thing with <a id="l8503"></a>the fourth Beast. The Beast which I saw, saith Iohn, <em class="underline">was like unto <a id="l8504"></a>a Leopard, &amp; his feet were  as the feet of a Bear, &amp; his mouth as the <a id="l8505"></a>mouth of a Lyon.</em> Iohn here names all the four beasts backwards <a id="l8506"></a>&amp; puts the ten-horned beast in the first place to signify that he <a id="l8507"></a>was the fourth. And then he adds: <em class="underline">And the Dragon gave the Beast <a id="l8508"></a>his power &amp; his Throne &amp; great authority</em>, that is his western <a id="l8509"></a>power &amp; his western Throne &amp; great authority in the west. For the <a id="l8510"></a>Beast reigned in the west, &amp; therefore the Dragon at this time by <a id="l8511"></a>a division of the Roman Empire between himself &amp; the Beast <a id="l8512"></a>relinquished the Western Empire to the Beast &amp; reserved only the <a id="l8513"></a>eastern Empire  or kingdom of Pergamus to himself. While <a id="l8514"></a>both Empires continued united they were both the Dragon &amp; both <a id="l8515"></a>the Beast, &amp; therefore they have common head &amp; common horns <a id="l8516"></a>But the Dragon has crowns upon his heads &amp; the Beast upon <a id="l8517"></a>his horn to signify that the Beast with his horns were latent in <a id="l8518"></a>the Dragon during the reign of the common heads &amp; that he reigned in his <a id="l8519"></a>horns after their separation. So then before the division of the <a id="l8520"></a>Empire the whole was both Dragon &amp; Beast, but upon the division <a id="l8521"></a>they separated &amp; the Dragon continued to reign in the Greek <a id="l8522"></a>Empire  reserving to himself his throne in <a id="l8523"></a>Pergamus, &amp; gave the Beast his power &amp; throne in the west,  at the same time the ten horns received power as kings.</p>

And <a id="l8547"></a>the Earth or eastern Empire opened her mouth &amp; swallowed up <a id="l8548"></a>the flood. And the Dragon (in the reign of Iulian) was wroth with <a id="l8549"></a>the Woman &amp; (by a new division of the Empire) went (from her) <a id="l8550"></a>to make war with the remnant of her seed  who keep the <a id="l8551"></a>commandments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus, that is, <a id="l8552"></a>with the 144000 who in this war are sealed with the seale <a id="l8553"></a>of God in their foreheads &amp; worship in the second Temple &amp; by reason of their testimony are called <a id="l8554"></a>the two witnesses &amp; stand on the sea of glass in the second Temple upon <a id="l8555"></a>Mount Sion with the Lamb, ( who appeared slain at the foot of the <a id="l8556"></a>Altar)  &amp; sing the song of <a id="l8557"></a>Moses (  who had power to turn the  waters into blood &amp; smite the <a id="l8558"></a>earth with all plagues  <a id="l8559"></a>in the street of the great city spiritually called Egypt,) &amp; the song of <a id="l8560"></a>the Lamb  with the 144000 upon Mount Sion. <a id="l8561"></a>And when the Dragon (by a division of the Empire) went from the Woman, Iohn saw a Beast rising up <a id="l8562"></a>out of the sea (by the same  division)  having seven heads &amp; ten horns <a id="l8563"></a>&amp; crowns upon  his horns (the fourth Beast of Daniel) &amp; the <a id="l8564"></a>Dragon (by the final division of the Empire) gave him his (western) power &amp; <a id="l8565"></a>throne &amp; great authority.

For so the Iews considered God as sitting on a throne between the Cheriums <a id="l8609"></a>above the Ark.
