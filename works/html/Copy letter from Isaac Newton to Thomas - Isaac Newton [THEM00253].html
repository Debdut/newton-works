<p id="par1" class="i0">Sir</p>
<p id="par2">Your argument p 118 I acknowledg good against those who suppose <a id="l1"></a>only hills &amp; mountains taken out of the Sea, &amp; it may be good against <a id="l2"></a>those who suppose all the earth higher then the sea taken out thence <a id="l3"></a>but one who would have mountains &amp; the sea made by removing <a id="l4"></a>earth from one place to another might suppose (if it were necessa<a id="l5"></a>ry) all the earth a quarter of a mile or half a mile lower <a id="l6"></a>then the top of the seas or then the lowest valleys, or even <a id="l7"></a>lower then that, was thrown out of the deep. But the opinion <a id="l8"></a>being to me absurd, I say no more of it. I could wish I <a id="l9"></a>was as well satisfied with your argument about the oval figure <a id="l10"></a>of the earth. ffor it seems hard to me that a constant force <a id="l11"></a>applied to stretch a membrane (as you figuratively term the <a id="l12"></a>atmosphere) should make it shrink, unless you suppose it at <a id="l13"></a>first overstretcht by a tumultuary force &amp; so to return by way <a id="l14"></a>of undulation, &amp; that the limus of the earth hardened while it <a id="l15"></a>was in the ebb. But what ever may be the reason of the earths <a id="l16"></a>figure you desire my opinion what that figure is. I am most <a id="l17"></a>inclined to beleive it spherical or not much oval. And my chief <a id="l18"></a>reason for that opinion is the analogy of the Planets. They all <a id="l19"></a>appear round so far as we can discern by Telescopes, &amp; I take <a id="l20"></a>the earth to be like the rest. If it's diurnal motion would <a id="l21"></a>make it oval that of Iupiter would much more make Iupiter oval <a id="l22"></a>the vis centrifuga at his equator caused by his diurnal motion <a id="l23"></a>being 20 or 30 times greater then the vis centrifuga at our equator <a id="l24"></a>caused by the diurnal motion of our earth, as may be collected from <a id="l25"></a>the largeness of his body &amp; swiftness of his revolutions. The sun also <a id="l26"></a>has a motion about his axis &amp; yet is round. What may be argued <a id="l27"></a>from the dimensions of the earth's shaddow collected by Lunar Eclipses <a id="l28"></a>I cannot tell, nor what from the measures on the earth answering <a id="l29"></a>to a degree in several latitudes, not knowing how exactly those mea<a id="l30"></a>sures were made or the Latitudes of places taken.</p>
<p id="par3">You seem to apprehend that I would have the present face <a id="l31"></a>of the earth formed in the first creation. A sea I beleive was then <a id="l32"></a>formed as Moses expresses, but not like our sea, but with an eaven <a id="l33"></a>bottom, without any precipices or steep descents as I think I exprest <a id="l34"></a>in my letter. Of our present sea, rocks, mountains &amp;c I think you <a id="l35"></a>have given the most plausible account. And yet if one would go <a id="l36"></a>about to explain it otherwise Philosophically, he might say that <a id="l37"></a> as saltpeter dissolved in water, though the solution be uniform <a id="l38"></a>crystallises not all over the vessel alike but here &amp; there in <a id="l39"></a>long barrs of salt: so the limus of the Chaos or some substances in it might coagulate at <a id="l40"></a>first, not all over the earth alike, but here &amp; there in veins or <a id="l41"></a>beds of divers sorts of stones &amp; minerals. That in other places which <a id="l42"></a>remained yet soft, the air which in some measure subsided out of the <a id="l43"></a>superior regions of the  chaos together with the earth or limus, by de<a id="l44"></a>grees extricating it self, gave liberty to the limus to shrink &amp; <a id="l45"></a>subside &amp; leave the first coagulated places standing up like hills: <a id="l46"></a>which subsiding would be encreased by the draining &amp; drying of that <a id="l47"></a>limus. That the veins &amp; tracts of limus in the bowels of those mountains <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span> also drying &amp; consequently shrinking, crack't &amp; left many cavi<a id="l48"></a>ties some dry others filled with water. That after the upper crust <a id="l49"></a>of the earth by the heat of the sun together with that caused by <a id="l50"></a>action of minerals, was hardened &amp; set; the earth in the lower <a id="l51"></a>regions still going closer together left large caverns between it <a id="l52"></a>&amp; the upper crust filled with the water which upon subsiding by <a id="l53"></a>its weight it spewed out by degrees till it had done shrinking, which <a id="l54"></a>caverns or subterraneal seas might be the great deep of Moses<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l55"></a>And if you will, it may be supposed one great orb of water <a id="l56"></a>between the upper crust or gyrus &amp; the lower earth, though perhaps <a id="l57"></a>not a very regular one. That in process of time many exhalations <a id="l58"></a>were gathered in those caverns which would have expanded them <a id="l59"></a>selves into 40 or 50 times the room they lay in, or more, had <a id="l60"></a>they been at liberty. ffor if air in a glass may be crouded into <a id="l61"></a>18 or 20 times less room then it takes at liberty &amp; yet not burst <a id="l62"></a>the glass, much more may subterranean exhalations by the vast weight <a id="l63"></a>of the incumbent earth be keept crouded into a less room before <a id="l64"></a>they can in any place lift up &amp; burst that  crust of earth. <a id="l65"></a>That at length somewhere forcing a breach, they by expanding <a id="l66"></a>themselves forced out vast quantities of water before they could all <a id="l67"></a>get out themselves, which commotion caused tempests in the air &amp; there<a id="l68"></a>by by great falls of rain in spouts &amp; all together made the flood &amp; <a id="l69"></a>after the vapors were out the waters retired into their former place. <a id="l70"></a>That the air which in the beginning subsided with the earth, by <a id="l71"></a>degrees extricating it self might be pent up in one or more <a id="l72"></a>great caverns in the lower earth under the abyss &amp; at the <a id="l73"></a>time of the flood breaking out into the abyss &amp; consequently expanding it <a id="l74"></a>self might also force out the waters of the abyss before it. <a id="l75"></a>That the upper crust or gyrus of earth might be upon the <a id="l76"></a>stretch before the breaking out of the abyss &amp; then by its <a id="l77"></a>weight shrinking to its natural posture might help much to force <a id="l78"></a>out the waters. That the subterraneal vapors which then first <a id="l79"></a>brake out &amp; have ever since continued frequently to do so, <a id="l80"></a>being found by experience noxious to mans health infect the air <a id="l81"></a>&amp; cause that shortness of life which has been ever since the <a id="l82"></a>flood. And that several pieces of earth either at the flood <a id="l83"></a>or since falling, some perhaps into the great deep, others into <a id="l84"></a>less &amp; shallower cavities, have caused many of those Phænomena <a id="l85"></a>we see on the earth besides the original hills and cavities.</p>
<p id="par4">But you will ask how could an uniform chaos coagulate at <a id="l86"></a>first irregularly in heterogenous veins or masses to cause hills. Tell <a id="l87"></a>me then how an uniform solution of saltpeter coagulates irregularly into <a id="l88"></a>long barrs; or to give you another instance, if Tinn, (such as the Pew<a id="l89"></a>terers buy from the mines in Cornwel to make Pewter of) be melted <a id="l90"></a>&amp; then let stand to cool till it begin to congeal &amp; when it be<a id="l91"></a>gins to congeale at the edges, if it be inclined on one side for the <a id="l92"></a>more fluid part of the Tin to run from those parts which congeale <a id="l93"></a>first, you will see a good part of the Tin congealed in lumps which <a id="l94"></a>after the fluider part of the Tin which congeales not so soon is <a id="l95"></a>run from between them appear like so many hills with as much <a id="l96"></a>irregularity as any hills on the earth do. Tell me the cause of this <a id="l97"></a>&amp; the answer will perhaps serve for the Chaos.</p>
<p id="par5">All <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>this<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> I write not to oppose you, for I think the main part <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> of your Hypothesis as probable as what I have here written, if <a id="l98"></a>not in some respects more probable. And though the pressure of the <a id="l99"></a>Moon or Vortex &amp;c may promote the irregularity of the causes of <a id="l100"></a>hills, yet I did not in my former letter design to explain the ge<a id="l101"></a>neration of hills thereby, but only to insinuate how a Sea might be <a id="l102"></a>made above ground in your own hypothesis before the flood besides <a id="l103"></a>the subterranean great deep, &amp; thereby all difficulty of explaining <a id="l104"></a>rivers &amp; the main point in which some may think you &amp; Moses dis<a id="l105"></a>agree might be avoyded. But this sea I do not suppose round the <a id="l106"></a>Equator but rather to be two seas in two opposite parts of it where <a id="l107"></a>the cause of the flux &amp; reflux of our present Sea deprest the soft mass <a id="l108"></a>of the earth at that time when the upper crust of it hardened.</p>
<p id="par6">As to Moses I do not think his description of the creation either <a id="l109"></a>Philosophical or feigned, but that he described realities in a language ar<a id="l110"></a>tificially adapted to the sense of the vulgar. Thus where he speaks <a id="l111"></a>of two great lights I suppose he means their apparent, not real great<a id="l112"></a>ness. So when he tells us God placed those lights in the firmament, he speaks <a id="l113"></a>I suppose of their apparent not of their real place, his business being <a id="l114"></a>not to correct the vulgar notions in matters philosophical <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>but<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> to adapt <a id="l115"></a>a description of the creation as handsomly as he could to the sense &amp; capa<a id="l116"></a>city of the vulgar. So when he tells us of two great lights &amp; the starrs made the <a id="l117"></a>4<sup>th</sup> day, I do not think their creation from beginning to end was <a id="l118"></a>done the fourth day nor in any one day of the creation nor that Moses <a id="l119"></a>mentions their creation as they were physicall bodies in themselves some of them greater <a id="l120"></a>then this earth &amp; perhaps habitable worlds, but only as they were <a id="l121"></a>lights to this earth, &amp; therefore though their creation could not physi<a id="l122"></a>cally  <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>be<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> assigned to any one day, yet being a part of the sensible cre<a id="l123"></a>ation which it was Moses's design <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>to<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> describe &amp; it being his design to describe <a id="l124"></a>things in order according to the succession of days allotting no more then <a id="l125"></a>one day to one thing, they were to be referred to some day or other <a id="l126"></a>&amp; rather to the 4<sup>th</sup> day then any other if the air then first be<a id="l127"></a>came clear enough for them to shine through it &amp; so put on the <a id="l128"></a>appearance of lights in the firmament to enlighten the earth. ffor <a id="l129"></a>till then they could not properly be described under the notion of such <a id="l130"></a>lights, nor was their description under that notion to be deferred after <a id="l131"></a>they had that appearance though it may be the creation of some of <a id="l132"></a>them was not yet completed. Thus far perhaps one might be allowed <a id="l133"></a>to go in the explaining the creation of the 4<sup>th</sup> day, but in the  third day <a id="l134"></a>for Moses to describe the creation of seas when there was no such thing <a id="l135"></a>done neither in reality nor in appearance me thinks is something <a id="l136"></a>hard. &amp; that the rather becaus if before the flood there was no <a id="l137"></a>water but that of rivers that is none but fresh water above ground <a id="l138"></a>there could be no fish but such as live in fresh water &amp; so one <a id="l139"></a>half of the fift days work will be a non entity &amp; God must be put <a id="l140"></a>upon a new creation after the flood to replenish one half of this terra<a id="l141"></a>queous globe with Whales &amp; all those other kinds of Sea fish we now <a id="l142"></a>have.</p>
<p id="par7">You ask what was that light created the first day? Of what extent <a id="l143"></a>was the Mosaical chaos? Was the firmament if taken for the atmosphere so <a id="l144"></a>considerable a thing as to take up one day's work? &amp; would not the description <a id="l145"></a>of the creation have been complete without mentioning it? To answer these <a id="l146"></a>things fully would require comment upon Moses whom I dare not pretend to un<a id="l147"></a>derstand: yet to say something by way of conjecture, one may suppose that all the <a id="l148"></a>Planets about our Sun were created together, there being in no history any mention <a id="l149"></a>of new ones appearing or old ones ceasing. That they all &amp; the sun <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>too<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> had at first <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002v"> &lt;2v&gt; </span> one common Chaos. That this Chaos by the spirit of God moving upon it <a id="l150"></a>became separated into several parcels each parcel for a planet. That <a id="l151"></a>at the same time the matter of the sun also separated from the rest <a id="l152"></a>&amp; upon the separation began to shine before it was formed into that <a id="l153"></a>compact &amp; well defined body we now see it. And the preceding darkness <a id="l154"></a>&amp; light now cast upon the chaos of every Planet from the Solar chaos was <a id="l155"></a>the evening &amp; morning which Moses calls the first day even before the <a id="l156"></a>earth had any diurnall motion or was formed into a globular body. <a id="l157"></a>That it being Moses design to describe the origination of this earth only &amp; <a id="l158"></a>to touch upon other things only so far as they related to it, he passes <a id="l159"></a>over the division of the general chaos into particular ones &amp; does not so much as describe the <a id="l160"></a>fountain of that light God made that is the Chaos of the Sun, but only with <a id="l161"></a>respect to the Chaos of our Earth tells us that God made light upon the <a id="l162"></a>face of the deep where darkness was before. Further one might <a id="l163"></a>suppose that after our chaos was separated from the rest, by the same <a id="l164"></a>principle which promoted its separation (which might be gravitation towards a <a id="l165"></a>center) it shrunk closer together &amp; at length a great part of it condensing <a id="l166"></a>subsided in the form of a muddy water or limus to compose this terraqueous <a id="l167"></a>globe. The rest which condensed not separated into two parts the vapors <a id="l168"></a>above &amp; the air which being of a middle degree of gravity, ascended from <a id="l169"></a>the one descended from the other &amp; gathered into a body stagnating between <a id="l170"></a>both. Thus was the Chaos at once separated into three regions the globe <a id="l171"></a>of muddy waters below the firmament the vapors or waters above the fir<a id="l172"></a>mament &amp; the air or firmament it self. Moses had before called the Chaos <a id="l173"></a><em class="underline">the deep</em> &amp; <em class="underline">the waters</em> on the face of which the spirit of God moved, &amp; here <a id="l174"></a>he teaches the division of all those waters into two parts with a firma<a id="l175"></a>ment between them: which being the main step in the generation of this earth <a id="l176"></a>was in no wise to be omitted by Moses. After this general division of the <a id="l177"></a>chaos Moses teaches a subdivision of one of its  parts, that is of the miry <a id="l178"></a>waters under the firmament into clear water &amp; dry land on the surface <a id="l179"></a>of the whole globous mass. ffor which separation nothing more was requisite <a id="l180"></a>then that the water should be drained from the higher parts of the limus to <a id="l181"></a>leave them dry land &amp; gather together into the lower to compose seas. <a id="l182"></a>And some parts might be made higher then others not only by the <a id="l183"></a>cause of the flux &amp; reflux but also by the figure of the Chaos if it <a id="l184"></a>was made by division from the Chaos's of other Planets. ffor then it could <a id="l185"></a>not be spherical. And now while the new planted vegetables grew to be <a id="l186"></a>food for Animals, the heavens becoming clear for the Sun in the day &amp; <a id="l187"></a>Moon &amp; starrs in the night to shine distinctly through them on the earth &amp; so put <a id="l188"></a>on the form of lights in the firmament so that had men been now living <a id="l189"></a>on the earth to view the process of the creation they would have judged <a id="l190"></a>those lights created at this time, Moses here sets down their creation <a id="l191"></a>as if he had then lived &amp; were now describing what he saw. Omit them <a id="l192"></a>he could not without rendring his description of the creation imperfect in the <a id="l193"></a>judgment of the vulgar. To describe them distinctly as they were in them <a id="l194"></a>selves would have made the narration tedious &amp; confused, <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>amased<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the vulgar <a id="l195"></a>&amp; become a Philosopher more then a Prophet. He mentions them therefore <a id="l196"></a>only so far as the vulgar had a notion of them, that is as they were phæ<a id="l197"></a>nomena in our firmament &amp; describes their making only so far &amp; at such <a id="l198"></a>a time as they were made such phænomena. Consider therefore whether <a id="l199"></a>any one who understood the process of the creation &amp; designed to accommodate <a id="l200"></a>to the vulgar not an Ideal or poetical but a true description of it as succinctly <a id="l201"></a>&amp; theologically as Moses has done, without omitting any thing material which the <a id="l202"></a>vulgar have a notion of or describing any being further then the vulgar have <a id="l203"></a>a notion of it, could mend that description which Moses has given us. If it be <a id="l204"></a><span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>said<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> that the expression of making &amp; setting two great lights in the firmament is <a id="l205"></a>more poetical then natural, so also are some other expressions of Moses, as where <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3&gt; </span> he tells us the windows or floodgates of heaven were opened Gen 7 &amp; after<a id="l206"></a>wards stopped again Gen 8 &amp; yet the things signified by such figurative <a id="l207"></a>expressions are not Ideall or moral but true. ffor Moses accommodating his <a id="l208"></a>words to the gross conceptions of the vulgar, describes things much after the <a id="l209"></a>manner as one of the vulgar would have been inclined to do  <a id="l210"></a>had he lived &amp; seen the whole series of what Moses describes.</p>
<p id="par8">Now for the number &amp; length of the six days: by what is said above <a id="l211"></a>you may make the first day as long as you please, &amp; the second day too <a id="l212"></a>if there was no diurnal motion till there was a terraqueous globe, that <a id="l213"></a>is till towards the end of that days work. And then if you will suppose the <a id="l214"></a>earth put in motion by an eaven force applied to it, &amp; that the first <a id="l215"></a>revolution was done in one of our years, in the time of another year <a id="l216"></a>there would be three revolutions of a third five of a fourth seaven &amp;c <a id="l217"></a>&amp; of the 183<sup>d</sup> yeare 365 revolutions, that is as many as there are days <a id="l218"></a>in our year &amp; in all this time Adams life would be increased but <a id="l219"></a>about 90 of our years, which is no such great business. But yet I must <a id="l220"></a>profess I know no sufficient naturall cause of the earth<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>'s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> diurnal motion. <a id="l221"></a>Where natural causes are at hand God uses them as instruments in his <a id="l222"></a>works, but I doe not think them alone sufficient for the creation &amp; there<a id="l223"></a>fore may be allowed to suppose that amongst other things God gave the <a id="l224"></a>earth it's motion by such degrees &amp; at such times as was most suitable <a id="l225"></a>to the creatures. If you would have a year for each days work <a id="l226"></a>you may by supposing day &amp; night was made by the annual motion <a id="l227"></a>of the earth only &amp; that the earth had no diurnal motion till towards <a id="l228"></a>the end of the six days. But you'l complain of long &amp; dolefull nights. <a id="l229"></a>And why might not birds &amp; fishes endure one long night as well as those <a id="l230"></a>&amp; other animals endure many in Greenland, or rather why not better <a id="l231"></a>then the tender substances which were growing into animals might endure <a id="l232"></a>successions of short days &amp; nights &amp; consequently of heat and cold? ffor <a id="l233"></a>what think you would become of an egge or Embryo which should fre<a id="l234"></a>quently grow hot &amp; cold? Yet if you think the night too long, it's but <a id="l235"></a>supposing the divine operations quicker. But be it as it will, me thinks <a id="l236"></a>one of the tenn commandment given by God in mount Sina, prest by divers <a id="l237"></a>of the prophets, observed by our Saviour, his Apostles &amp; first Christians for <a id="l238"></a>300 years &amp; with a day's alteration by all Christians to this day, should not <a id="l239"></a>be grounded on a fiction. At least Divines will hardly be perswaded to <a id="l240"></a>beleive so.</p>
<p id="par9">As I am writing, another illustration of the generation of hills <a id="l241"></a>proposed above comes into my mind. Milk is as uniform a liquor as <a id="l242"></a>the chaos was. If beer be poured into it &amp; the mixture let stand till it <a id="l243"></a>be dry, the surface of the curdled substance will appear as rugged &amp; <a id="l244"></a>mountanous as the earth in any place. I forbear to describe other causes <a id="l245"></a>of mountains, as the breaking out of vapours from below before the <a id="l246"></a>earth was well hardned, the settling &amp; shrinking of the whole globe <a id="l247"></a>after the upper regions or surface began to be hard. Nor will I urge <a id="l248"></a>their antiquity out of Prov. 8.25. Iob: 15.7 Psal. 90.2 but rather beg <a id="l249"></a>your excuse for this tedious letter, which I have the more reason to do <a id="l250"></a>because I have not set down any thing I  have well considered <a id="l251"></a>or will undertake to defend.</p>
