<p id="par1" class="i0">seven kings according to Pausanias or between seven &amp; eight <a id="l1"></a>according to Herodotus. Which reigns according to Chrono<a id="l2"></a>logers took up the space of 244 years, which is much too <a id="l3"></a>long dor the course of nature. For seven reigns at 20 <a id="l4"></a>years a piece amount to no more then 140 years, <a id="l5"></a>that is 89 years to the death of Cyrus &amp; 51 years more <a id="l6"></a>to the invasion of Greece by Xerxes; &amp; if we should <a id="l7"></a>add half a reign more, it will make but 99 years to <a id="l8"></a>the death of Cyrus. So then the return of the Hera<a id="l9"></a>clides was about 289 or 299 years (or in round numbers <a id="l10"></a>300) ancienter then the death of Cyrus. For<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> Anaxan<a id="l11"></a>drides &amp; Ariston kings of Sparta were contemporary to <a id="l12"></a>Cræsus.</p> 
<p id="par2">Polydectes king of Sparta being slain before the <a id="l13"></a>birth of his son Charillus or Charilaus, left the king<a id="l14"></a>dom to his brother Lycurgus the legislator, &amp; Lycur<a id="l15"></a>gus upon the birth of Charillus became Tutor to the <a id="l16"></a>child, &amp; published his laws in the reign of Agesila<a id="l17"></a>us the successor of Dorissus in the other race of the <a id="l18"></a>kings of Sparta. Now the names of Lycurgus being <a id="l19"></a>on the Olympic Disk, Aristotle concluded thence <a id="l20"></a>that Lycurgus was the companion of Iphitus in <a id="l21"></a>restoring the Olympic games. But Iphitus did not <a id="l22"></a>restore all those games. He restored the racing in the first <a id="l23"></a>Olympiad, Coæbus being victor.<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> In the 14<sup>th</sup> Olympiad the <a id="l24"></a>double stadium was added, Hypænus being victor. And in the <a id="l25"></a>18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad the Quinquertium &amp; Wrestling were re<a id="l26"></a>stored, Lampus &amp; Eurybatus (two Spartians) being Victors. <a id="l27"></a>Now the Disk was one of the games of the Quinquerti<a id="l28"></a>um, &amp; Pausanius<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> tells us that there were three disks <a id="l29"></a>kept in the Olympic treasury at Altis, &amp; produced in <a id="l30"></a>those games. Doubless these were they which had the name <a id="l31"></a>of Lycurgus on them, being dedicated by  him. So <a id="l32"></a>then the game of the Disk was restored in the 18<sup>th</sup> <a id="l33"></a>Olympiad, &amp; at that time Lycurgus &amp; Agesilaus flou<a id="l34"></a>rished, &amp; Charillus was a child. From the return of the <a id="l35"></a>Heraclides to the beginning of the reign of Agesilaus there <a id="l36"></a>were six reigns, &amp; from the same return to the beginning <a id="l37"></a>of the reign of Polydectes in the other race of the Spartan <a id="l38"></a>kings there were also six reigns, &amp; these reigns at 19 years <a id="l39"></a>a piece (the medium between 18 &amp; 20) amount to <a id="l40"></a>114 years; &amp; if we may reccon about seven years more <a id="l41"></a>to the childhood of Charillus &amp; restoration of the Quin<a id="l42"></a>quertium in the 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, the return of the He<a id="l43"></a>raclides will be about 300 years ancienter then the death <a id="l44"></a>of Cyrus as above. Chronologers have been therefore <a id="l45"></a>much mistaken in making Lycurgus Charillus &amp; Agesilaus <a id="l46"></a>as old as Iphitus, &amp; all of them almost two hundred years <a id="l47"></a>older then the 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad.</p>

<p id="par3">Socrates died three years after the end of the Pelo<a id="l48"></a>ponnesian was, &amp; Plato introduces him saying, that <em class="underline">the In<a id="l49"></a>stitutions of Lycurgus were not of three hundred years stand<a id="l50"></a>ing or not much more</em>. And Thucydides<sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup>, in the reading follow<a id="l51"></a>ed by Stephens, saith that <em class="underline">the Lacedemonians had from ancient <a id="l52"></a>times used good laws &amp; been free from tyranny, &amp; that <a id="l53"></a>from the time that they had used one &amp; the same ad<a id="l54"></a>ministration of their common wealth to the end of the <a id="l55"></a>Pelopennesian war there were three hundred years &amp; a</em> <a id="l56"></a>few more. From the end of that war count backwards <a id="l57"></a>300 years &amp; the reconning will end at the 19<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. <a id="l58"></a>And therefore the laws of Lycurgus were made about <a id="l59"></a>the time of that Olympiad or but a little before</p>
<p id="par4">Athenæus<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> tells us out of ancient authors (Hellanicus, <a id="l60"></a>Sosimus &amp; Hieronymus) that Lycurgus the Legislator was <a id="l61"></a>contemporary to Terpander the Musician, &amp; that Terpander <a id="l62"></a>was the first man who got the victory in the Carnea in <a id="l63"></a>a solemnity of musick instituted in those festivals in the <a id="l64"></a>26<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. Terpander therefore was victor in the <a id="l65"></a>26<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, &amp; Lycurgus flourished in the same age. <a id="l66"></a>Terpander was<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> a Lyric Poet &amp; imitated Orpheus and <a id="l67"></a>Homer &amp; sung his own verses &amp; Homer's &amp; wrote the <a id="l68"></a>Laws of the Lacedemonians in verse, &amp; therefore flou<a id="l69"></a>rished after Lycurgus had brought the  Poesy of <a id="l70"></a>Homer out of Asia &amp; published it in Greece. He overcame <a id="l71"></a>four times in the Pythic games &amp; was the first who <a id="l72"></a>distinguished the modes of Lyric music by several names. <a id="l73"></a>And Ardalus &amp; Clonas soon after did the like for wind <a id="l74"></a>music. And from henceforward several eminent Musicians <a id="l75"></a>&amp; Poets flourished in Greece as Archilochus, Polymnestus, <a id="l76"></a>Thaletas, Xenodamus, Xenocritus, Sacadas, Tyrtæus, <a id="l77"></a>Telesilla, Alcman, Arion, Stesichorus, Mimnermus, <a id="l78"></a>Alcæus, Sappho, Theognis, Anacreon, Pindar, by whom <a id="l79"></a>the Music &amp; Poetry of the Greeks was brought to its per<a id="l80"></a>fection.</p>
<p id="par5">The Amphictyons by the advice of Solon made <a id="l81"></a>Alcmæon the son of Megacles an Athenian &amp; Clisthenes <a id="l82"></a>king of Sicyon &amp; Eurolycus king of Thessaly commanders of <a id="l83"></a>their army in their war against Cyrrha &amp; the Cyrrhæans <a id="l84"></a>were conquered an. 2 Olymp. 47 according to the Marbles. This <a id="l85"></a>Alemæon<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> enterteined &amp; conducted the messengers which Cræsus sent <a id="l86"></a>to consult the Oracle at Delphos, &amp; for so doing was sent for by <a id="l87"></a>Cræsus &amp; rewarded with much riches. Clisthenes proclaiming that <a id="l88"></a>he would marry his daughter  Agarista within a <a id="l89"></a>year to the most deserving, there came to court her Megacles the <a id="l90"></a>son of this Alcmæon &amp; Leocides the son of Phidon the Argive &amp; <a id="l91"></a>several others &amp; Clisthenes gave his daughter to Megacles. This <a id="l92"></a>was that Phidon king of Argos who appointe weights &amp; measures <a id="l93"></a>&amp; coined silver money in Ægina &amp; invading Elis presided in the <a id="l94"></a>Olympiads, as Herodotus sufficiently describes. Phidon therefore <a id="l95"></a>was contemporary to Alemæon &amp; both of them to Clisthenes &amp; Solon <a id="l96"></a>&amp; their sons Megacles &amp; Leocides were contemporary to one another <a id="l97"></a>&amp; to Pisistratus. For Megacles Pisistratus &amp; Lycurgus commanded <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> the three factions into which the Athenians were divided a <a id="l98"></a>little before the tyranny of Pisistratus, &amp; when Pisistratus <a id="l99"></a>obteined the tyranny he married the daughter of Megacles, &amp; <a id="l100"></a>he &amp; Pisistratus ejected one another by turns, &amp; at length Clis<a id="l101"></a>thenes the son of Megacles &amp; Agarista expelled the sons of <a id="l102"></a>Pisistratus an. 1 Olymp 67 according to the Marble. So then <a id="l103"></a>Phidon flourished in the 47<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, or thereabouts, that is, <a id="l104"></a>about 60 years before the death of Cyrus or 240 after the <a id="l105"></a>return of the Heraclides.</p>
<p id="par6">Ætolus<sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> the son of Endymion about four generations before <a id="l106"></a>the Argonautic expedition being driven out of Elea by Salmonens <a id="l107"></a>the grandson of Hellen retired with his people into the region <a id="l108"></a>which from him was called Ætolia. From him descended Oxylus <a id="l109"></a>the son of Hæmon  the son of Thoas the son of Andræmon. Hercules &amp; Andræmon married two sisters, Thoas warred&amp; Troy Oxylus with a body of Ætolians returned with <a id="l110"></a>the Heraclides into Peloponnesus &amp; recovered Elea, &amp; by the <a id="l111"></a>friendship of the Heraclides had the care of the Olympic temple <a id="l112"></a>commited to him, &amp; the Heraclides for his service done them <a id="l113"></a>granted to him further upon oath that the country of the <a id="l114"></a>Eleans should be free from invasions &amp; be defended by them <a id="l115"></a>from all armed force. And  when the Eleans were thus con<a id="l116"></a>secrated, Oxylus restored the Olympic games; &amp; after they had <a id="l117"></a>been again intermitted, Iphitus<sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> their king who was descended <a id="l118"></a>from Oxylus restored them again. This second restoration was <a id="l119"></a>above one generation after the return: for Iphitus was <a id="l120"></a>not the immediate son of Oxylus, his fathers name being <a id="l121"></a>as some say Hæmon, as others Praxonidas the son of <a id="l122"></a>Hæmon; nor above two generations younger because <a id="l123"></a>by our chronology stated above there was but about 60 <a id="l124"></a>or 70 years between the return of the Heraclites &amp; the <a id="l125"></a>first Olympiad in which Choræbus was victor. Iphitus was <a id="l126"></a>therefore the grandson of Oxylus &amp; by consequence the <a id="l127"></a>son of Praxonidas the son of Oxylus the son of Hæmon.</p>
<p id="par7">Iphitus<sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> præsided both in the temple of Iupiter Olympus <a id="l128"></a>&amp; in the Olympic games &amp; so did his successors till the 26<sup>th</sup> <a id="l129"></a>Olympiad; &amp; so long the Victors were rewarded with a <a id="l130"></a>Tripus: But then the Pisæans getting above the Eleans <a id="l131"></a>began to preside &amp; rewarded the Victors with a crown <a id="l132"></a>&amp; instituted the Carnea to Apollo &amp; continued to preside <a id="l133"></a>till Phidon interrupted them, that is till about the <a id="l134"></a>time of the 48<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. For<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> in the 48<sup>th</sup> Olym<a id="l135"></a>piad the Eleans entred the country of the Pisæans <a id="l136"></a>with an army suspecting their designs but were prevailed <a id="l137"></a>with to return home quietly. Afterwards the Pisæans confedera<a id="l138"></a>ted with several other Greek nations (videlicet Phidon &amp; those <a id="l139"></a>under him) &amp; made war upon the Eleans &amp; in the end <a id="l140"></a>were beaten. In this war I conceive it was that Phidon <a id="l141"></a>presided suppose in the  49<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. For<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> in the 50<sup>th</sup> <a id="l142"></a>Olympiad, for putting an end to the contentions between the <a id="l143"></a>kings about presiding, two men were chosen by lot out of <a id="l144"></a>the city of Elis to preside, &amp; their number in the 65<sup>th</sup> Olym<a id="l145"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span>piad was increased to nine &amp; afterwards to ten, &amp; these <a id="l146"></a>judges were called Hellenodicæ, judges for or in the <a id="l147"></a>name of Greece. Pausanias tells us that the Eleans <a id="l148"></a>called in Phidon &amp; together with him celebrated the <a id="l149"></a>eighth [he should have said the 49<sup>th</sup>] Olympiad, but Herodotus that Phidon removed <a id="l150"></a>the Eleans. And both might be true. The Eleans <a id="l151"></a>might call in Phidon against the Pisæans, and upon <a id="l152"></a>overcoming them claim the presiding in the games <a id="l153"></a>&amp; be refused by Phidon &amp; then confederate with the <a id="l154"></a>Spartans and by their assistance overthrow the king<a id="l155"></a>dom of Phidon &amp; recover from the Pisæans their <a id="l156"></a>ancient right of presiding in the games.</p>
<p id="par8">When Phidon had introduced coinage, Solon <a id="l157"></a>after his example regulated the weights &amp; money <a id="l158"></a>of the Athenians.

For the Greeks at first used masses of <a id="l165"></a>metal stamped with an Ox or a Sheep or a Hogg for <a id="l166"></a>the convenience of buying &amp; selling cattel, and <a id="l167"></a>thence these masses of metal were called Oxen &amp; pecunia, &amp; some of them from their shape, Oboli, <a id="l168"></a>they being in the form of long barrs. Such money <a id="l169"></a>Homer &amp; Draco call Oxen, &amp; such was the iron <a id="l170"></a>money of Lycurgus, &amp; the money of all Greece <a id="l171"></a>before Plidon &amp; Solon regulated it by weight. <a id="l172"></a>Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> tells us that the coinage of gold &amp; silver <a id="l173"></a>&amp; the buying &amp; selling of drink &amp; victualls for money <a id="l174"></a>began in Asia minor. Phidon brought coinage from <a id="l175"></a>thence into Greece for the use of the Merchants of <a id="l176"></a>Ægina. The Romans being poorer coined no copper <a id="l177"></a>money before the reign of Ancus Martius, no silver <a id="l178"></a>money till about three years before the first Punic war <a id="l179"></a>An. 1 Olymp. 128, no gold money till about 62 years <a id="l180"></a>after that. Solon might coin in the 53<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, Ancus Martius <a id="l181"></a>for want of gold &amp; silver might follow the example of Philon <a id="l182"></a>&amp; Solon in copper money some years later. When the Heraclides <a id="l183"></a>returned into Peloponnesus under the conduct of Temenus Cresphontes <a id="l184"></a>&amp; Aristodemus, Temenus became king of Argos, &amp; was succeeded by his son Cisus, <a id="l185"></a>&amp; then the kingdom ceased &amp; became divided among the posterity of Teme<a id="l186"></a>nus untill Phidon recovered it: &amp; Strabo tells us that Phidon <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> was the tenth from Temenus, not the tenth king <a id="l187"></a>(for between Cisus &amp; Phidon they reigned not) but the <a id="l188"></a>tenth by generation from father to son including Te<a id="l189"></a>Menus or the ninth excluding him, &amp; these nine gene<a id="l190"></a>rations taking up the 240 years from Temenus to <a id="l191"></a>Phidon there were about 80 years to three generati<a id="l192"></a>ons which being by the chief of the family is a moderate <a id="l193"></a>recconing. But Chronologers reccon about 511 years from the return of the Heraclites to the 47<sup>th</sup> Olympiad &amp; account Phidon the 7<sup>th</sup> from Temenus which is after the rate of 85 years to a generation &amp; therefore not to be admitted.</p>
<p id="par9">Some make Phidon as ancient as Iphitus &amp; tell us <a id="l194"></a>that the kingdom of Macedon was founded by his brother <a id="l195"></a>Caranus before the Olympiads. But Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> who lived <a id="l196"></a>nearest those times &amp; was best able to inform himself is <a id="l197"></a>most to be credited; &amp; he tells us that Perdiccas founded <a id="l198"></a>that kingdom &amp; that from the founding thereof reigned <a id="l199"></a>these kings, Perdiccas, Argesus, Philippus, Acropus, Al<a id="l200"></a>cetas, Amyntas, Alexander, the last of which was <a id="l201"></a>contemporary to Xerxes. Let their reigns be recconed <a id="l202"></a>at about 18 years a piece one with another &amp; counted <a id="l203"></a>backwards from the death of Xerxes, &amp; they will place <a id="l204"></a>the founding of that kingdom about 63 years before the <a id="l205"></a>death of Cyrus &amp; by consequence in the days of Phidon <a id="l206"></a>&amp; his brother Caranus. Perdiccas was<sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> of the posterity of <a id="l207"></a>Temenes &amp; fled from Argos into Macedonia, &amp; the same <a id="l208"></a>seems true of Caranus because he was the brother of <a id="l209"></a>Phidon king of Argos. Whence it's probable that Caranus &amp; <a id="l210"></a>Perdiccas were companions in some common expedition &amp; <a id="l211"></a>led colonies from Argos into Macedonia; the wars whereby <a id="l212"></a>Phidon  conquered  his kindred &amp; reunited the kingdom of Argos &amp; others    was conquered<sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup> <a id="l213"></a>by others giving occasion to their flight. For Phidon subdued to himself the whole possession of Temenus then divided into many parts; &amp; was soon after overthrown by the Eleans &amp; Spartans together. In these things Thucydides<sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup> <a id="l214"></a>agrees with Herodotus. For he tells us that there were <a id="l215"></a>eight kings of Macedon before Archelaus the son of <a id="l216"></a>Perdiccas the son of Alexander, &amp; therefore  Alexander was the seventh as above. He tells us <a id="l218"></a>also that the progenitors of Alexander were of the poste<a id="l219"></a>rity of Temenus &amp; came from Argos &amp; obteined the <a id="l220"></a>sea coasts of Macedonia &amp; reigned there expelling the <a id="l221"></a>inhabitants of Pieria by war. Vnder Perdiccas the first <a id="l222"></a>of the eigth kings, the Temenides left their seats in <a id="l223"></a>Argos  to  the Greeks who conquered Phidon &amp; sought new seats in <a id="l224"></a>Macedonia, expelling the Pierians, who in like manner <a id="l225"></a>fled from their seats to Pangæum. And this seems to be the <a id="l226"></a>original of the kingdom of Macedon.</p>
<p id="par10">By the preceding computations the Argonautic Expedition <a id="l227"></a>was about 413 years earlier then the death of Cyrus, &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> by consequence about 39 years later then the death of Solo<a id="l228"></a>mon. Now the Trojan war was about one generation <a id="l229"></a>later then the expedition: for the sons of the Argonauts <a id="l230"></a>were at that war. Whence Æsculapius, whose sons Poda<a id="l231"></a>lirius &amp; Machaon were at that war, was contemporary <a id="l232"></a>to the Argonauts, &amp; accordingly<sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup> I find him &amp; several Argo<a id="l233"></a>nauts together at the hunting of the Calydinian Bore. Now from <a id="l234"></a>Æsculapius to Hippocrates inclusively are recconed 18 male <a id="l235"></a>generations by the fathers side &amp; 19 generations by the <a id="l236"></a>mothers side. And because these generations being taken <a id="l237"></a>notice of in history were most probably by the principal <a id="l238"></a>of the family &amp; so for the most part by the eldest sons <a id="l239"></a>we may reccon about 80 or 90 years to three generati<a id="l240"></a>ons. And thus the 17 intervals by the fathers side &amp; 18 <a id="l241"></a>by the mothers will at a middle recconing amount <a id="l242"></a>to about 497 years, which counted backwards from <a id="l243"></a>the middle of the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus <a id="l244"></a>when Hippocrates flourished will reach up to the 39<sup>th</sup> <a id="l245"></a>year after the death of Solomon as above. But <a id="l246"></a>Chronologers reccon about 790 years from the Argo<a id="l247"></a>nautic Expedition to the middle of the reign of Arta<a id="l248"></a>xerxes Longimanus, which being after the rate of 45 <a id="l249"></a>years to a generation, is much too long for the course <a id="l250"></a>of nature.</p>
<p id="par11">We have hitherto recconed by  genealogies &amp; <a id="l251"></a>the reigns of kings, this being the foundation of the Chro<a id="l252"></a>nology of the Greeks. And by shewing how erroneously <a id="l253"></a>the Greeks have recconed from thence &amp; setting right <a id="l254"></a>the recconing we have brought Chronology much nearer <a id="l255"></a>to the truth &amp; obviated  such objections as might arise <a id="l256"></a>from the authority of the Greek Chronologers. And now <a id="l257"></a>because arguments drawn from Astronomy are accounted <a id="l258"></a>the surest, we shall confirm our recconing by an ar<a id="l259"></a>gument of that sort.</p>

<p id="par12"> The <a id="l266"></a>first Astronomers I meet with in Phrygia &amp; Greece were Endymion <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> Aristæus, Linus, Musæus, Chiron, Atreus, Ancæus Orpheus, Palamedes<sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> <a id="l267"></a>All these flourished a little before the Trojan war. Then <a id="l268"></a>came on dark times till Thales &amp; Anaximander revived <a id="l269"></a>Astronomy. Homer &amp; Hesiod mention several Constellations <a id="l270"></a>&amp; therefore the Constellations were formed before their <a id="l271"></a>days &amp; by consequence before the destruction of Troy, <a id="l272"></a>there being no Astronomers celebrated between that war <a id="l273"></a>&amp; the days of Thales. Sophocles<sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> tells us that Palamedes <a id="l274"></a>the son of Nauplius found out Aritmetic &amp; measuring <a id="l275"></a>&amp; the heavenly signes &amp; the measures &amp; the revolutions of the <a id="l276"></a>stars &amp;  turnings of the Beare &amp; setting of the Dog &amp; improved <a id="l277"></a>Navigation &amp; the art of war. This is that Palamedes who added <a id="l278"></a>four letters to the alphabet &amp; invented the game at Chess, &amp; was so much honoured by the <a id="l279"></a>Greeks that they made him commander of their army for a time in the room <a id="l280"></a>of Agamemnon. Vlysses to avoyd going to the Trojan war feigned <a id="l281"></a>himself mad &amp; Palamedes discovered the fraud &amp; after they <a id="l282"></a>went to the war Vlysses by a fraudulent accusation caused <a id="l283"></a> Palamedes to be slain by the Greeks, &amp; when the Greeks <a id="l284"></a>had taken Troy &amp; were returning home, Nauplius in revenge <a id="l285"></a>of his sons death made a fire in the night upon the high rock <a id="l286"></a>Caphareus in Eubœa where he was king, &amp; the Greeks sailing <a id="l287"></a>towards the light as to a safe port, split many of their <a id="l288"></a>ships against the rock. Frome all which I gather that Pala<a id="l289"></a>medes was a young man when he to the wars at Troy &amp; <a id="l290"></a>formed the Constellations a little before the beginning of that <a id="l291"></a>war. And hence it is that all the first Constellations relate to <a id="l292"></a>the times preceding that war. In the Constellations of Perseus, <a id="l293"></a>Andromeda, Cepheus, Cassiopœa &amp; Cete you have the story of <a id="l294"></a>Perseus. In those of  Vrsa major &amp; Arctophylax you have Callisto &amp; her son Arcas.  In those of the ship Argo, the Dragon Hydra, <a id="l296"></a>Medea's cup, the Crow  or Raven denoting the death of Hydra, <a id="l297"></a> the golden Ram, the fiery Bull &amp; the <a id="l298"></a>twins Castor &amp; Pollux, you have the Argonautic expedition. Engo<a id="l299"></a>nasis, Sagitta,  Vultur cadens, Draco, Cancer, Leo relate <a id="l300"></a>to Hercules. There's Orion the   son of Euryale the daughter of Minos, with his Dogs &amp; <a id="l301"></a>Hare &amp; river Endamus.. There's Ariadnes Crown, Orpheus's Harp, Bellerophon's Horse, <a id="l302"></a>Læda's Swan, Neptune's Dolphin, Ganimede's  Eagle, Æs<a id="l303"></a>culapius with his serpent, Chiron the master of Iason with his Altar &amp; sacrifice,  &amp; Erichthonius king of Athens <a id="l305"></a> &amp; Astræa. There's Virgo or Astræa Sagittary or Crotus the Centaur the son of the nurse of the Muses,, Capricorn or Pan, Aqua<a id="l306"></a>rius or Ganimede,  the Fishes of Venus &amp; their mother the south Fish.. All these Constellations <a id="l307"></a>relate to the Argonautic expedition &amp; the times immediately preceding it. <a id="l308"></a>There is nothing in them relating to the times after that ex<a id="l309"></a>pedition, (excepting some new Constellations as Antinous,  Coma Be<a id="l310"></a>renices, Libra &amp; the little Beare formed long after the rest) &amp; therefore the primitive Constellations were <a id="l311"></a>formed presently after that Expedition or  perhaps about 20 or 25 <a id="l312"></a>years after when Iason, Hercules, Leda, Castor, Pollux, Orpheus &amp; <a id="l313"></a>Æsculapius were dead &amp; deified so that they might be honoured in the <a id="l314"></a>Constellations, &amp; the Heros who lived after that expedition were not yet <a id="l315"></a>dead or not in so much repute as to be capable of that honour.</p>

<p id="par15" class="i0">Aristæus the Astronomer married Autonoe the daughter of Cadmus &amp; therefore <a id="l365"></a>was about three generations older then the Argonauts. He was <a id="l366"></a>born &amp; educated in Libya  his mother <a id="l367"></a>Cyrene being carried thither from Greece &amp; got with child, as <a id="l368"></a>was pretended by Apollo; &amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup> from thence he brought into Greece <a id="l369"></a>the inventions of making cheese &amp; bee-hives &amp; honey &amp; planting <a id="l370"></a>Olive yards &amp; making Oyle &amp; of observing &amp; determining the <a id="l371"></a>solstices by the risings &amp; settings of the starrs. Atlas<sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup> an Egyptian <a id="l372"></a>who was about one generation older then the Argonauts &amp; governed <a id="l373"></a>Libya then a Province of Egypt, &amp; was skilled in Philosophy <a id="l374"></a>Astronomy &amp; navigation, made a Sphere, &amp; in memory thereof <a id="l375"></a>is painted with a sphere upon his back. And the Greeks soon <a id="l376"></a>followed his example. For<sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup> Chiron the Master of Iason <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from above the line of f 8v &gt; </span>the chief of the Argonauts delineated σχήματα ὀλύμπου  the Asterisms as <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r-a"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> Clemens out of the ancient author of the Gigantomachia informed us.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 8v resumes &gt; </span> made a sphere <a id="l377"></a>&amp;  is reported the first among the Greeks who made one. But the <a id="l378"></a>Asterisms of the Greeks were different from those of the <a id="l379"></a>Egyptians &amp; Libyans. These things might be done by Chiron &amp; <a id="l380"></a>Musæus while the ship Argo was building not sooner because that ship was one of the Asterisms, nor later because Chiron was at that time very ancient, being born in the golden age, &amp; ,  <a id="l381"></a>being the grandfather of the Argonauts Peleus &amp; Telamon. The sphere was therefore made for the use of the Argonauts: For the Asterisms were at <a id="l382"></a>first delineated for the use of Navigators. The people of the <a id="l383"></a>Island Corcyra<sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup> attributed the invention of the sphere to Nau<a id="l384"></a>sicae the daughter of Alcinous being king of the Pheaces in that <a id="l385"></a>Island, and she might learn it from the Argonauts who in <a id="l386"></a>their return home sailed to that Island<sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> &amp; made some stay <a id="l387"></a>there with her father. Sophocles tells us that Palamedes<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 8r resumes &gt; </span>Sophocles<sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> tells us that Palamedes the son of <a id="l388"></a>Nauplius king of Eubœa found out Arithmetick &amp; measuring &amp; the heavenly signes &amp; the <a id="l389"></a>measures &amp; revolutions of the stars &amp; turnings of the Beare &amp; setting <a id="l390"></a>of the Dog &amp; improved Navigation &amp; the art of war. This is that Pala<a id="l391"></a>medes who added four letters to the Alphabet. He was so much honoured by <a id="l392"></a>the Greeks that they generally followed his counsells &amp; made him com<a id="l393"></a>mander of their army for a time in the room of Agamemnon. Nau<a id="l394"></a>plius was a very skilfull sayler &amp; one of the Argonauts &amp; survived the destruction of Troy, &amp; might teach his son Palamedes &amp; Pala<a id="l395"></a>medes was slain at Troy &amp; therefore measured the stars (that is their distances) <a id="l396"></a>  &amp; formed or reformed the signes &amp; asterisms before he went to that war. Musæus might set the stars on the globe by viewing the heavens as a Painter draws a face, &amp; Palamedes by his  measures might draw the signes &amp; asterisms  &amp; solstices &amp; Equinoxesmore exactly. In those days<sup class="note" id="n36-ref">[36]</sup> Astronomers understood also the motion of the sun in the Ecliptic from west to east <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r-b"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> &amp; the return of his eclipses &amp; observed the solstices. For in the Island Syrie <a id="l401"></a>or Syrus there was an Heliotropium or place prepared for observing the Solstice <a id="l402"></a>as Bochart<sup class="note" id="n37-ref">[37]</sup> shews out of Homer &amp; his old Scholiast: which Heliotropium remained <a id="l403"></a>there till the days of Diogenus Laertius. Servius<sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup> saith that Atreus found an eclips of <a id="l404"></a>the sun which came to pass, that is he predicted it or at least found out the reason of it.</p>
<p id="par16">Now Achilles Tatius<sup class="note" id="n39-ref">[39]</sup> tells us that some anciently placed the solstice <a id="l405"></a>in the beginning of Cancer, other in the eighth degree of Cancer, others about the <a id="l406"></a>twelft &amp; others about the 15<sup>th</sup> degree. This variety of opinions proceeded from the <a id="l407"></a>Precession of the Equinox. At first the solstice was in the 15<sup>th</sup> degree or middle <a id="l408"></a>of the Constellation of Cancer, then in the 12<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup> &amp; 1<sup>st</sup> degree successively. <a id="l409"></a>The Iews began their year with that new Moon which fell upon the Vernal <a id="l410"></a>Equinox or within half a month before or after it. This year they brought <a id="l411"></a>out of Egypt changing only the beginning thereof from the autumnal <a id="l412"></a>equinox to the vernal. And to make the first month begin in the first <a id="l413"></a>signe the Egyptians in their sphere &amp; the Greeks in theirs might place <a id="l414"></a>the Equinoxes &amp; Solstices in the middles of the signes. For the Greeks had <a id="l415"></a>their knowledge from Egypt &amp; began the Attic year sometimes before &amp; <a id="l416"></a>sometimes after the summer solstice, as Iews did their year <a id="l417"></a>both before &amp; after the Vernal Equinox.</p>
<p id="par17">After the times of the Argonautic Expedition &amp; Trojan war <a id="l418"></a>the communication between Greece &amp; Egypt ceased &amp; Astronomy <a id="l419"></a>lay neglected till  Psammiticus let the Greeks into <a id="l420"></a>Egypt &amp; Thales travelled thither. For<sup class="note" id="n40-ref">[40]</sup> Thales revived Astronomy <a id="l421"></a>observed the stars himself, was reputed the first of the Greeks who could <a id="l422"></a>predict Eclipses, &amp; wrote a book of the Tropicks &amp; Equinoxes <a id="l423"></a>&amp; predicted them. And his scholar Anaximander<sup class="note" id="n41-ref">[41]</sup> erected Gno<a id="l424"></a>mons to observe the Solstices &amp; Equinoxes &amp; made a Sphære.

<p id="par20">After the times of the Argonautic Expedition &amp; Trojan <a id="l471"></a>war, Astronomy lay neglected till the days of Thales.

We may therefore reccon <a id="l489"></a>him the first who removed the  Solstices &amp; equinoxes from the <a id="l490"></a>15<sup>th</sup>degrees of the signes &amp; placed <a id="l491"></a>them in the 12<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p id="par21"> After Thales had revived Astronomy &amp; rectified the  Solstice, the Greeks became intent upon reforming their Lunisolar year.

Then Meton found out the exacter Cycle of 19 years &amp; in order to publish it he &amp; Euctemon observed the Solstice in the year of Nabonassar 316 &amp; Columella tells us that they <a id="l494"></a>placed it in the eighth degree of Cancer: which opinion <a id="l495"></a>published to the people in the Tables of that <a id="l496"></a>Cycle became generally received &amp; continued long in <a id="l497"></a>vogue.

And therefore it was about that <a id="l517"></a>time that the Equinoxes &amp; Solstices fell upon the end of the <a id="l518"></a>15<sup>th</sup> degrees of the Signes, or that Palamedes formed the Aste<a id="l519"></a>risms of the Zodiac in such manner that the Equinoxes &amp; <a id="l520"></a>Solstices might fall upon the middles of them.</p>
<p id="par22">Eudoxes was either contemporary <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n49-ref">[49]</sup> to Meton or a little <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n50-ref">[50]</sup> later. <a id="l521"></a> but followed the older Astronmers <a id="l524"></a>&amp; published a new Octaeteris &amp; a book of Phænomena in <a id="l525"></a>prose wherin he described the old Sphere of the Greeks <a id="l526"></a>with the Constellations. Aratus wrote the same things in verse <a id="l527"></a>&amp; Hipparchus Bithynus wrote a third book upon them both: <a id="l528"></a>which books of Aratus &amp; Hipparchus are still extant. <a id="l529"></a>Geminus has given us an Ephemeris of the suns passing through <a id="l530"></a>the twelve signes, beginning the signes of Libra &amp; Capricorn, <a id="l531"></a>&amp; by consequence those also of Arius &amp; Cancer, with the <a id="l532"></a>Equinox &amp; Solstice of Euctemon, &amp; placing the winter <a id="l533"></a>solstice of Euoxus on the 4<sup>th</sup> day of Capricorn, that is, <a id="l534"></a>three days later then the winter solstice of Euctemon, &amp; the <a id="l535"></a>spring Equinox of Eudoxus on the sixt day of Aries, that <a id="l536"></a>is, five days later then the spring Equinox of Euctemon. <a id="l537"></a>Whence its evident that Eudoxus did not observe the Equi<a id="l538"></a>nox himself but  following the traditions of the ancient Astronomers, placing it were it was in the days of Thales <a id="l539"></a>or before &amp; knowing nothing of its  motion. And for this <a id="l540"></a>reason in describing the sphere of the Ancients, he copied <a id="l541"></a>after their Equinoxes &amp; Solstices as well as after their Constellations <a id="l542"></a>For he placed the Equinoxes &amp; Solstices in the middles of the <a id="l543"></a>Constellations of Aries Chelæ Cancer &amp; Capricorn, as is <a id="l544"></a>affirmed by Hipparches &amp; appears manifestly by the descrip<a id="l545"></a>tion of the Equinoctial &amp; Tropical circles in Aratus who <a id="l546"></a>copied after Eudoxus, &amp; more plainly by the words of  Eudoxus cited by Hipparchus, &amp; still more plainly <a id="l548"></a>by the position of the Colures.  For <a id="l549"></a>Hipparchus tells us that Eudoxus drew the Colure of the <a id="l550"></a>solstices through the middle of the great Beare &amp; the middle of <a id="l551"></a>Cancer &amp; the neck of Hydrus &amp; the star between the Poop &amp; <a id="l552"></a>Mast of Argo &amp; the tail of the south fish, &amp; through the <a id="l553"></a>middle of Ca-pricorn &amp; of Sagitta &amp; through the neck &amp; right <a id="l554"></a>wing of the Swan &amp; left hand of Cepheus; &amp; that he drew the  Æquinoctial <a id="l555"></a>Colure through the left hand of Arctophylax &amp; along the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span> middle of his body &amp; cross the middle of Chelæ &amp; through <a id="l556"></a>the right hand &amp; foreknee of the Centaur &amp; through the <a id="l557"></a>flexure of Eridanus &amp; head of Cetus &amp; the back of Aries across &amp; through the head &amp; right hand of Perseus.</p>
<p id="par23">In the end of the year 1660 the middle of the Aselli &amp; Præ<a id="l558"></a>sepe, a small Constellation in the middle of the Constellation of <a id="l559"></a>Cancer was in <span class="ns">♌</span> 3. 15. 21.

<p id="par24">The back of Aries through which the solsticial Colure should <a id="l579"></a>pass is a star of the sixt magnitude whose longitude in the end of <a id="l580"></a>the year 1660 was <span class="ns">♉</span>9<sup>d</sup>. 22'. 57" &amp; north latitude 6<sup>d</sup>. 7' 20".

<p id="par25">So then the Equinoxes &amp; Solstices in the end of the <a id="l612"></a>year 1660 were gone back 35<sup>d</sup>. 50' . 16"  from their first <a id="l613"></a>places &amp; therefore recconing with Astronomers that they <a id="l614"></a>go back a degree in 72 years &amp; by consequence 35<sup>d</sup>. 50' <a id="l615"></a>in 2580 yeares &amp; counting these years backwards <a id="l616"></a>from the end of the year 1660, the recconing will <a id="l617"></a>place the  description of the Globe by Palamedes about <a id="l618"></a>60 years after the death of Solomon.</p>
<p id="par26">Hipparchus Rhodius the great Astronomer flourished almost <a id="l619"></a>300 years after Meton &amp; by comparing his own Observations <a id="l620"></a>with those of former Astronomers concluded  first of any <a id="l621"></a>man that the Equinoxes had a motion backwards in respect of <a id="l622"></a>the fixt stars &amp; went backwards  one degree in about an hundred years.  For<sup class="note" id="n51-ref">[51]</sup> such was the motion of the Equinox between the <a id="l623"></a>days of Palamedes &amp; the days of Hipparchus according to <a id="l624"></a>the Chronology of the ancient Greeks.  To make it <a id="l625"></a>go back a degree in 72 years (which is the truth)The time between Palamedes <a id="l626"></a>&amp; Hipparchus must be shortened in the proportion of  100 to <a id="l627"></a> 72:  &amp; by this means Palamedes will flourish about 60 or <a id="l628"></a>70 years after the death of Solomon.

<p id="par32">To these two sorts of arguments taken from the genealogies &amp; reigns of the Greeks <a id="l721"></a>&amp; from Astronomy I will now add a third sort taken from the  antiquities of  the East where Chronolo<a id="l723"></a>gy was much ancienter then in Greece. For Tatian an Assyrian in <a id="l724"></a>his book against the Greeks relates that amongst the Phœnicians fourished <a id="l725"></a>three ancient historians Theodotus, Hypsicrates &amp; Mochus who all of <a id="l726"></a>them delivered in their Histories (translated into Greek by Lætus) that <a id="l727"></a>under one of the kings happened the rapture of Europa, the voy<a id="l728"></a>age of Menelaus into Phœnicia &amp; the league &amp; friendship <a id="l729"></a>between Solomon &amp; Hiram when Hiram gave his daughter to <a id="l730"></a>Solomon &amp; supplied him with timber for building the Temple, <a id="l731"></a>&amp; that the same is affirmed by Menander of Pergamus. <a id="l732"></a>Vnder one of the kings, that is, within the compass of the <a id="l733"></a>age of a man: for so the phrase is used by Isaiah chap. <a id="l734"></a>XXIII.15. Iospehus<sup class="note" id="n56-ref">[56]</sup> lets us know that the Annals of the Tyri<a id="l735"></a>ans from the time of Abibalus &amp; Hiram were  extant in his days, &amp; that Menander of Pergamus <a id="l737"></a>translated them into Greek, &amp; that Hiram's friendship to Solomon <a id="l738"></a>&amp; assistance in building the Temple was mentioned in them. <a id="l739"></a>And by the testimony of Menander &amp; the three ancient Phœ<a id="l740"></a>nician Historians above mentioned, the rapture of Europa hap<a id="l741"></a>pened in the same age with the building of Solomons Tem<a id="l742"></a>ple. Let the authority therefore of the Eastern historians <a id="l743"></a>who were very ancient &amp;  copied from the original Annals of <a id="l744"></a>their Cities be set against that of the Greek Chronologers who <a id="l745"></a>were neither ancient nor had ancient Annals nor agree <a id="l746"></a>amongst themselves.</p>
<p id="par33">The Trojan war was in the days of Cinyrus king of Byblus &amp; Cyprus <a id="l747"></a>&amp; in the days of Belus king of Tyre the father of Pygmaleon &amp; Dido. <a id="l748"></a>For when the Greeks were preparing to make war upon Troy Cinyras <a id="l749"></a>sent Agamemnon a breast-plate as Homer mentions: &amp; Venus <a id="l750"></a>the mistress of Cinyras &amp; of his son Adonis lay with Anchises <a id="l751"></a>in her youth &amp; by him had Æneas who warred against the Greeks <a id="l752"></a>at Troy &amp; after that war sailed to Italy about the same time <a id="l753"></a>that Dido fled from her brother Pigmaleon &amp; built Carthage as <a id="l754"></a>Virgil relates.

<p id="par34" class="i0">Servius adds: Cyprum subactam Belus concessit Teucro ut <a id="l772"></a>in ea collocaret imperium. Belus therefore took Cyprus from <a id="l773"></a>Cinyras &amp; there gave seats to the Greeks who assisted him <a id="l774"></a>in that conquest. Servius tells us that this Belus was called <a id="l775"></a>Methres, &amp; Iosephus calls him Matgenus, &amp; tells us out of <a id="l776"></a>the Tyrian Annals that he reigned nine years &amp; that Carthage <a id="l777"></a>was built in the seventh year of his son &amp; successor Pigma<a id="l778"></a>leon, &amp; the Temple of Solomon founded in the end of <a id="l779"></a>the eleventh  or beginning of the twelft year of <a id="l780"></a>Hiram. And setting down the reigns of the several kings <a id="l781"></a>of Tyre, he reccons from the reign of Hiram (meaning <a id="l782"></a>from his birth) to the building of Tyre 155 years &amp; 8 months. <a id="l783"></a>Let the first 19 years of Hirams life which preceded <a id="l784"></a>his reign &amp; the first 11 years of his reign which preceded <a id="l785"></a>the founding of the Temple be deducted, &amp; there will <a id="l786"></a>remain 125 years &amp; 8 months from the founding of <a id="l787"></a>the Temple to the building of Carthage, as may be <a id="l788"></a>also gathered  by summing up the years of the Kings <a id="l789"></a>of Tyre. Now the Temple being founded in the fourth <a id="l790"></a>year of Solomon in the second month of the year, that <a id="l791"></a>is, 36 years &amp; some months before his death, deduct <a id="l792"></a>those years &amp; months &amp; Carthage will be founded 89 <a id="l793"></a>years after the death of Solomon. Seing therefore that <a id="l794"></a>Matgenus began his reign 15 years before the founding of <a id="l795"></a>that City &amp; reigned nine years, the coming of Teucer to <a id="l796"></a>Cyprus will be not less then 74 years nor more then 83 <a id="l797"></a>years after the death of Solomon &amp;  Troy was taken not above <a id="l798"></a>seven years before.

‡Pliny, Solinus &amp; Isidorus tell us that Erythia at Gades had its name <a id="l830"></a>from the Tyrians who came from the red sea, <em class="underline">Erythia dicta est quoniam <a id="l831"></a>Tyrij aborigines eorum, orti a rubro mari ferebantur</em> Plin. l. 4. c. 22. <a id="l832"></a><em class="underline">In capite Bœticæ insula a continenti septingentis passibus memoratur <a id="l833"></a>quam Tyrij a mari rubro profecti Erytheam, Pœni sua lingua <a id="l834"></a>Gadir id est sepem nominarunt</em>: Solin cap. 26 <em class="underline">Quam Tyrij a rubro <a id="l835"></a>mari profecti occupantes in lingua sua Gades id est septum nomina <a id="l836"></a>verunt</em>: Isidorus. These Tyrians traded on the red sea in the fleet <a id="l837"></a>of Solomon &amp; Hiram but afterwards quitted that sea &amp; came to the <a id="l838"></a>mediterranean. For Iehosaphat built ships at Ezion Geber  in the reign of Ahazia to go to Tarshish. Ahaziah reigned two <a id="l840"></a>years &amp; died about two years before the reign of Pigmalion &amp; then <a id="l841"></a>the Edomites who had ever since the reign of David been governed <a id="l842"></a>by a Deputy revolted &amp; set up a king of their own &amp; the the <a id="l843"></a>ships were broken &amp; the merchants of Tyre &amp; Iudah driven from <a id="l844"></a>the red sea. Hitherto Sidon had traded on the Mediterranean &amp; <a id="l845"></a>Tyre on the Red sea there being friendship between the Iews &amp;  Tyrians <a id="l846"></a> And this is the reason why Homer celebrates Sidon for arts <a id="l847"></a>&amp; navigation but makes no mention of Tyre. But now the Tyrians <a id="l848"></a>being forced from the red sea began to  trade upon the medi<a id="l849"></a>terranean &amp; make long voyages going to places not yet possest <a id="l850"></a>by the Sidonians &amp; thereby became more famous for naviga<a id="l851"></a>tion then the Sidonians did before, &amp; gave the names of Ery<a id="l852"></a>thia to Gades &amp; Tartessus or Tarshish to the river Bœtis which <a id="l853"></a>flows into the ocean neare Gades &amp; to the Island &amp; City at <a id="l854"></a>the mouth of that river. For this was one of the remotest <a id="l855"></a>places they then sailed unto &amp; here the Tyrians at their <a id="l856"></a>first coming found very much silver &amp; therefore they looked <a id="l857"></a>upon this place as their new Tarshish. Aristotel<sup class="note" id="n65-ref">[65]</sup> tells us that <a id="l858"></a><em class="underline">the first Phenicians when they sailed to Tartessus purchased <a id="l859"></a>so much silver for oyle &amp; other naval trash that the ships <a id="l860"></a>could not carry it away &amp; therefore at their departure they <a id="l861"></a>made all their utensils  &amp; even their anchors of silver.</em> <a id="l862"></a>So then the Tyrians came from the red sea to the mediterranean <a id="l863"></a>in the beginning of the reign of Pygmalion, or a year or two <a id="l864"></a>before, Teucer then reigning in Cyprus.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 17r resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par35">Manetho tells us that  the brothers Ægyptus &amp; Danaus were by the Egyptians <a id="l866"></a>called Sethosis &amp; Armais &amp; that Sethosis being strong in horses &amp; ships <a id="l867"></a>left the government of Egypt to Armais, &amp; invaded Cyprus, Phœnicia <a id="l868"></a>&amp; the Assyrians &amp; Medes, subduing all before him: &amp; being lifted <a id="l869"></a>up with these successes went on more boldly subverting the eastern <a id="l870"></a>cities &amp; provinces &amp; by his being long abroad gave opportunity <a id="l871"></a>to Armais to rebel. Whereupon Sethosis returned hastily to <a id="l872"></a>Pelusium &amp; recovered his kingdom but not without a great escape. <a id="l873"></a>For Armais invite him to a feast, made him drunk &amp; in the <a id="l874"></a>night set fire to the house intending to burn him &amp; his wife <a id="l875"></a>&amp; as many of his children as were with him. But Sethosis <a id="l876"></a>(whom Herodotus &amp; Diodorus in telling this story call Sesostris  &amp; Sesoosis) <a id="l877"></a>escaped &amp; Armais fled to Greece in a long ship of fifty oars <a id="l878"></a>carrying with him fifty of his daughters. For it seems during <a id="l879"></a>his dominion in Egypt he had married his daughters to the sons <a id="l880"></a>of Sethosis &amp; commanded them all to kill their husbands the same <a id="l881"></a>night, thinking by this stratagem to destroy Sethosis &amp; his whole <a id="l882"></a>family at once &amp; thereby to gain the kingdom to himself. Now <a id="l883"></a>Sethosis &amp; Armais or, as the Greeks call them, Ægyptus &amp; Dana<a id="l884"></a>us flourished about two generations before the destruction of Troy <a id="l885"></a>&amp; one before the Argonautic expedition as I gather by these <a id="l886"></a>arguments. 1 When Sesostris returned into Egypt he left a <a id="l887"></a>colony of Egyptians at Colchos under the government of <a id="l888"></a>Æetes, &amp; Phryxus fled to Ætes married his daughter Chalci<a id="l889"></a>ope, had four children by her &amp; died before the Argonautic <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span> expedition, but Ætes survived that Expedition &amp; his daughter <a id="l890"></a>Medea  was then in her prime &amp; married Iason. 2 The <a id="l891"></a>ship Argo was the first long ship built by the Greeks &amp; they built it after the pat<a id="l892"></a>tern of the long ship in which Danaus &amp; his Daughters came into <a id="l893"></a>Greece, Argus the son of Danaus being the master-builder. It had <a id="l894"></a>fifty oars like that of Danaus, &amp; before it was built the Greeks <a id="l895"></a>sailed in round vessels  invented in the red sea by king Erythra. <a id="l896"></a>It was built therefore a little after the coming of Danaus <a id="l897"></a>into Greece while his ship was still in being. 3 Archander <a id="l898"></a>&amp; Archilites married two of the daughters of Danaus &amp; were <a id="l899"></a>the sons of Achæus (a king of Thessaly, from whom the <a id="l900"></a>Greeks were called Achivi) &amp; Achæus was the son of Creusa <a id="l901"></a>the daughter of Erechtheus king of Athens. And therefore <a id="l902"></a>the daughters of Danaus were three generations younger <a id="l903"></a>then Erechtheus &amp; by consequence contemporary to Theseus <a id="l904"></a>the son of Ægeus the son of Pandion the son of Erechtheus, <a id="l905"></a>&amp; Theseus flourished from the days of Minos the son of Eu<a id="l906"></a>ropa till after the Argonautic expedition. 4 Vpon the come<a id="l907"></a>ing of Danaus into Greece his daughter Amymone being sent <a id="l908"></a>to find out water was got with child in the feilds &amp; bare <a id="l909"></a>Nauplius who married Clymene grand-daughter of Minos, &amp; <a id="l910"></a>by her had Palamedes. Now Nauplius was one of the Argo<a id="l911"></a>nauts &amp; lived till after the destruction of Troy without being <a id="l912"></a>decrepid with old age. For the Greeks having injuriously slain <a id="l913"></a>his son Palamedes at Troy, when they had taken that city &amp; were <a id="l914"></a>returning home, he in revenge drew their fleet upon rocks by <a id="l915"></a>making a fire upon the high rock Caphareus in <a id="l916"></a>Eubœa where he was king, &amp; slew those who were ship-wrackt <a id="l917"></a>&amp; escaped to the shoar. At the time of the Argonautic expedi<a id="l918"></a>tion he was therefore a young man as were almost all the Argonauts, <a id="l919"></a>suppose of about 20 or 30 years of age, &amp; therefore Danaus came <a id="l920"></a>into Greece a little above 20 years before that Expedition. So <a id="l921"></a>also Orpheus one of the Argonauts was born just after the return <a id="l922"></a>of Sesostris into Egypt as will appear hereafter. 5 When Sesostris <a id="l923"></a>returend back into Egypt he carried with him a great number of <a id="l924"></a>captives amongst whom was Tithonus a beutiful young man the son of Laomedon king of <a id="l925"></a>Troy. For Tithonus went into Ethiopia above Egypt (for so the Greeks <a id="l926"></a>call Thebais) &amp;  warred there, that is, in the army of the <a id="l927"></a>Egyptians &amp; spent the rest of his life among them there &amp; at Susa <a id="l928"></a>with Memnon who by the universal consent of the Greeks  <a id="l929"></a>reigned over Egypt &amp; Persia in the time of the Trojan war, &amp; was <a id="l930"></a>born  a little after the expedition of Sesostris &amp; captivity of Titho<a id="l931"></a>nus, the Greeks feigning that Tithonus was his father. Priam was the <a id="l932"></a>younger brother of Tithonus, but became decrepid with old age <a id="l933"></a>before the taking of Troy. The expedition of Sesostris was therefore <a id="l934"></a>in the reign of Laomedon when his sons Tithonus &amp; Priam were <a id="l935"></a>children &amp; Memnon, Nauplius &amp; Orpheus were not yet born. And <a id="l936"></a>from all these arguments I conclude that this expedition er was about <a id="l937"></a>60 or  70 years before the taking of Troy &amp; 20 or 30 years before <a id="l938"></a>the Argonautic expedition &amp; by consequence in the reign of Reho<a id="l939"></a>boam the son of Solomon, &amp; therefore it was the same expedi<a id="l940"></a>tion with that of Sesak. For Sesak<sup class="note" id="n66-ref">[66]</sup> came out of Egypt with twelve <a id="l941"></a>hundred chariots &amp; sixty thousand  horsmen &amp; foot without number <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span> and took the fenced cities of Iudah, &amp; God said <em class="underline">the Princes of <a id="l942"></a>Israel shall be his servants that they may know my servitude</em> <a id="l943"></a>(that is the servitude of my people) <em class="underline">&amp; the servitude</em> תוכלממ <a id="l944"></a>תוצראה <em class="underline">of the kingdoms of the earth</em>. And his army consisted <a id="l945"></a>of Libyans Troglodytes &amp; Ethiopians: which shews that the  Egyptians conquered those nations before. And in like manner <a id="l947"></a> Sesostris<sup class="note" id="n67-ref">[67]</sup> had a very great army in chariots, horse &amp; <a id="l948"></a>foot &amp;  first conquered Arabia [Troglodytica] &amp; Libya &amp; Ethiopia <a id="l949"></a> &amp; then invaded Iudea &amp; the nations eastward &amp; northward as far as <a id="l950"></a>India Colchos &amp; Thrace. Sesostris &amp; Sesak therefore at the same <a id="l951"></a>time reigned over the same dominions &amp; with like forces made <a id="l952"></a>the same new conquests &amp; therefore were one &amp; the same king. <a id="l953"></a>He whom the Egyptians called Sethos or Sethosis &amp; the Greeks <a id="l954"></a>Sesoosis &amp; Sesostris  the Iews called Sesak. For <a id="l955"></a>Iosephus<sup class="note" id="n68-ref">[68]</sup> affirms that Herodotus ascribes to Sesostris the actions <a id="l956"></a>of Sesak mentioning his expedition against Ierusalem &amp; <a id="l957"></a>conquest of Palestine &amp; erring only in the name of the <a id="l958"></a>king. Which is all one as to say that Sesak was that con<a id="l959"></a>queror whom Herodotus calls Sesostris. The old Scholiast of Apollonius Rhodius, out of Dicæarchus,<sup class="note" id="n69-ref">[69]</sup> calls him Seson<a id="l960"></a>chosis, saying that Sesonchosis who was king of all Egypt <a id="l961"></a>&amp; reigned after Orus the son of Osiris &amp; Isis, conquered <a id="l962"></a>all Asia &amp; a great part of Europe, &amp; erected pillars of <a id="l963"></a>his conquests, and made laws &amp; found out horsmanship &amp; <a id="l964"></a>left a colony at Æa with laws writ in Tables &amp; with <a id="l965"></a>Geographical Tables of his Conquests by land &amp; Sea &amp; <a id="l966"></a>that Theopompus calls him Sesostris.

And for doing this  Dædalus was celebrated as if <a id="l1044"></a>he had invented wings.

<p id="par49">Athamas king of a region in Bœotia married Ino the daugh<a id="l1231"></a>ter of Cadmus &amp; soon after put her away &amp; married Nephele by <a id="l1232"></a>whom he had Phryxus &amp; Helle &amp; Nephele dying he took Ino <a id="l1233"></a>again.

<p id="par54">The red sea being very shallow &amp; for that reason <a id="l1407"></a>calmer then the Mediterranean was navigable in smaller <a id="l1408"></a>vessels such as men could make in the beginning.

<p id="par56">How and when the Phenicians came from the Red Sea may <a id="l1429"></a>be gathered from the history of David. For when David smote <a id="l1430"></a>Edom, Ioab stayed there with all Israel six months untill he had <a id="l1431"></a>smitten every male in Edom. 1 King. 11.15, 16.

For Stephanus in Azot tells us τάυτην ἔκτισαν <a id="l1436"></a>εἷς τῶν ἐπανελθόντων ἀπ' Ερυθρᾶς θαλάσσης φευγάδων. <em class="underline">A <a id="l1437"></a>fugitive  or exul from the Red Sea built Azot or Ashdod</em>. <a id="l1438"></a>That is, a fugitive Prince of Edom fortified it against the <a id="l1439"></a>Israelites. By this victory over the Edomites, Ezion Gebar <a id="l1440"></a>&amp; Eloth (sea ports of the Edomites on the Red Sea) came into <a id="l1441"></a>the hands of David &amp; his successors.  And Solomon <a id="l1442"></a>built a Navy in Ezion Gebar &amp; sent it on the Red sea<sup class="note" id="n119-ref">[119]</sup> with <a id="l1443"></a>the fleet of Hiram king of Tyre to Tarshish &amp; Ophir for <a id="l1444"></a>gold &amp; silver &amp; ivory &amp; Peacocks [or Parrots] &amp; Apes and <a id="l1445"></a>pretious stones &amp; Almug trees; by which means the Queen of <a id="l1446"></a>Sheba or Sabæa in Arabia fælix heard of Solomon's glory; <a id="l1447"></a>&amp; Hiram sent with Solomon's servants in Solomon's Navy his <a id="l1448"></a>own servants shipmen who had knowledge of the sea. Solomon's <a id="l1449"></a>Servants where therefore novices in sea affairs &amp; Hiram's <a id="l1450"></a>servants were experienced shipmen who had knowledge of <a id="l1451"></a>those seas by former voiages, for Hiram had also a Navy <a id="l1452"></a>on the Red sea 1 King. 10.11, 22.

<p id="par57">When the Edomites were driven from their seats <a id="l1456"></a>it may be presumed that they sent out colonies upon <a id="l1457"></a>the Mediterranean, &amp; of this there are footsteps.

<p id="par58">Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n124-ref">[124]</sup> tells us that the Phenicians were the authors <a id="l1474"></a>of dissentions who coming from the red sea to the Mediterranean <a id="l1475"></a>&amp; seating themselves on the sea-coasts of Syria, quickly under<a id="l1476"></a>took long voyages &amp; in carrying Egyptian &amp; Assyrian wars <a id="l1477"></a>passed over to other coasts &amp; chiefly to Argos: for Argos was <a id="l1478"></a>then the chief city of Greece. That the Phenicians coming hither <a id="l1479"></a>exposed their merchandise, &amp; after 5 or 6 days when they had <a id="l1480"></a>sold almost all, certain weomen came to the sea amongst <a id="l1481"></a>whom was Io the daughter of Inachus. And whilst they bought <a id="l1482"></a>what they like, the Phenicians set upon them &amp; seizing Io <a id="l1483"></a>&amp; some others, carried them into their ship &amp; sailed into <a id="l1484"></a>Egypt, &amp; this was the beginning of injuries. That in requital <a id="l1485"></a>of this injury some Greeks of the Island Crete afterwards <a id="l1486"></a>coming to Tyre (he should say Sidon) carried away Europa &amp; <a id="l1487"></a>a while after the Greeks committed also a second injury <a id="l1488"></a>in carrying away Medea from Colchos. And when the king of <a id="l1489"></a>Colchos sent an embassadour to demand his daughter back <a id="l1490"></a>&amp; that the raptors might be punished, the Greeks answered <a id="l1491"></a>that as they (to wit the Egyptians of whom the kingdom of <a id="l1492"></a>Colchos was a Colony) had not punished the raptors of Io, so <a id="l1493"></a>neither would the Greeks punish those of Medea. In the next <a id="l1494"></a>age Paris stole Helena &amp; these things occasioned the ruin of <a id="l1495"></a>Troy. From these passages of Herodotus it appears that the trade of <a id="l1496"></a>the Phœnicians to Greece began upon their first coming from the Red <a id="l1497"></a>sea, &amp; that the rapture of Io happened in the beginning of this <a id="l1498"></a>trade &amp; that the rapture of Europa was committed soon after <a id="l1499"></a>in revenge of the rapture of Io. And therefore since the <a id="l1500"></a>rapture of Europa happened about the 17<sup>th</sup> or 18<sup>th</sup> year of Davids <a id="l1501"></a>reign, &amp; the Edomites were driven by David from the red <a id="l1502"></a>sea a little before whereby the trade of that sea came <a id="l1503"></a>into the hands of the Israelites: its reasonable to beleive <a id="l1504"></a>that these Edomites were the Erythræan Phœnicians <a id="l1505"></a>who came from the red sea to the Mediterranean &amp; being <a id="l1506"></a>deprived of their estates &amp; country &amp; trade on that sea, were <a id="l1507"></a>necessitated to seek out a new trade upon the Mediterranean <a id="l1508"></a>for getting a livelyhood, &amp; by consequence that the rapture <a id="l1509"></a>of Io happened between the 8<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign when <a id="l1510"></a>he was made king of all Israel &amp; went from Hebron to Ierusa<a id="l1511"></a>lem &amp; the 17<sup>th</sup> or 18<sup>th</sup> year of his reign when Europa was stole <a id="l1512"></a>&amp; Cadmus sent in quest of her. And therefore Io &amp; her brother <a id="l1513"></a>Phoroneus flourished in Davids reign, &amp; their father Inachus flou<a id="l1514"></a>rished in the reign of Samuel &amp; Saul. And since the Greeks feigned <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p031r"> &lt;31r&gt; </span> that Io after she was carried into Egypt became the Goddes Isis <a id="l1515"></a>the reign of Osiris &amp; Isis in Egypt according to the opinion of <a id="l1516"></a>the ancient Greeks who made the fable, was later then <a id="l1517"></a>eighth year of Davids reign. The Greeks tell us, that Niobe the daughter of Phoroneus was the first woman with whom Iupiter lay, &amp; therefore the raptures of Io &amp; Europa were later then the corruption of Niobe.</p>
<p id="par59">The principal trafic with Egypt has been in all ages <a id="l1518"></a>for corn. This was a commodity which Egypt abounded with <a id="l1519"></a>&amp; Greece in those days wanted. For plowing &amp; sowing was <a id="l1520"></a>not yet in use among the Greeks.  Tzetzes tells us that Cecrops sent Argus into Sicily &amp; Libya commanding him to procure corn which grews there &amp; send it into Greece; &amp; thence <a id="l1523"></a>it seems that the sowing of corn was propagated from Egypt into  Libya &amp; from Libya into Sicily before it came into Greece. Erechtheus  in a time of famin procured <a id="l1524"></a>a great quantity of corn from Egypt &amp; for this benefaction <a id="l1525"></a>was made king of Athens. This I reccon done  about the <a id="l1527"></a>middle of Davids reign, Erechtheus being then about 36 or 40 <a id="l1528"></a>years old: not much older because his daughter Procris con<a id="l1529"></a>verst with Minos king of Crete &amp; his grand son Thespis had 50 <a id="l1530"></a>daughter who lay with Hercules &amp; his daughter Orithya was <a id="l1531"></a>the mother of Calais &amp; Zete two of the Argonauts &amp; his <a id="l1532"></a>son Orneus was the father of Peteos the father of Menestheus <a id="l1533"></a>who warred at Troy; not much younger because his second son <a id="l1534"></a>Pandion was the father of Ægeus the father of Theseus &amp; <a id="l1535"></a>his daughter Creusa was the mother of Achæus the father <a id="l1536"></a>of Archander &amp; Archilites who married the daughters of <a id="l1537"></a>Danaus &amp; had wars with Lamedon the predecessor of Sicyon. <a id="l1538"></a>In those days Hellen the son of Deucalion king of Thessaly from whom the people <a id="l1539"></a>were called Hellenes, left his kingdom between his sons Æolus <a id="l1540"></a>Dorus &amp; Xuthus. From Æolus &amp; Dorus their people were called <a id="l1541"></a>Æoles &amp; Dores, but Xuthus was expelled  Thessaly <a id="l1542"></a>by his brothers &amp; fled to Athens in the reign of Erechtheus <a id="l1543"></a>&amp; married his daughter Creusa by whom he had two sons <a id="l1544"></a>Achæus &amp; Ion. Ion married Helice the daughter of Selinus <a id="l1545"></a>king of Ægialus &amp; succeeded Selinus in the kingdom &amp; gave the <a id="l1546"></a>name of Iones to the people who were before called Ægialean <a id="l1547"></a>Pelasgians. Achæus by the help of the Athenians &amp;  <a id="l1548"></a>Ægyaleans recovered his fathers kingdom in Thessaly &amp; gave <a id="l1549"></a>the name of Achivi to the people. In a war between the <a id="l1550"></a>Athenians under Erechtheus &amp; the Elusinians under Eumolpus <a id="l1551"></a>the Athenians being assisted by the Ægialeans made Ion their <a id="l1552"></a>captain, &amp; Erechtheus on one side &amp;  <a id="l1553"></a>Immaradus the son of Eumolpus on the other were slain in <a id="l1554"></a>battel. Whereupon the sons of Erechtheus falling out about <a id="l1555"></a>their fathers kingdom, Xuthus adjudged it to Cecrops the eldest <a id="l1556"></a>son, but Cecrops after he had by the assistance of Ion reigned <a id="l1557"></a>a while was expelled the kingdom by his brothers &amp; Pandion the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p032r"> &lt;32r&gt; </span> second son succeeded. He had war with Labdacus the grandson of <a id="l1558"></a>Cadmus, &amp; therefore Erechtheus was slain before the death of Lab<a id="l1559"></a>dacus who died young &amp; left his young son Laius under the tui<a id="l1560"></a>tion of Lycus before the reign of Amphion &amp; Zethus. And to <a id="l1561"></a>make room for all these things &amp; for the reign of the successors <a id="l1562"></a>of Erechtheus it seems to me that Erechtheus was slain about <a id="l1563"></a>the  tenth year of Solomons reign being then above 60 years old <a id="l1564"></a>because his grandson Ion was above 20. Afterwards his son Pandion <a id="l1565"></a>left the kingdom divided between his four sons giving Diacria <a id="l1566"></a>to Lycus, Paralia to Pallas, Megaris to Nisus &amp; Athens with the <a id="l1567"></a>region Acte to his eldest son Ægeus  the father of Theseus.</p>
<p id="par60">When  corn was  first brought out of the corn countries into Greece, it may be presumed that  the merchants would endeavour to bring <a id="l1569"></a>weomen  along with the corn to instruct &amp; assist the Greeks in the making <a id="l1570"></a>of bread  especially when <a id="l1571"></a>the brought a great quantity of corn out of Egypt &amp; perhaps some other places for Erechtheus. <a id="l1572"></a>For at that time Ceres is said to have come to Athens. She pre<a id="l1573"></a>tended to come in quest of her daughter, who  as Diodorus<sup class="note" id="n125-ref">[125]</sup> relates, was taken from her in Sicily, whence its probable that she came from Sicily. After she had <a id="l1575"></a>staid a while at Athens, she travelled from thence to Eleusis a city <a id="l1576"></a>of Attica, &amp; being there enterteined by the daughters of Celeus <a id="l1577"></a>king of Eleusis, she instructed his young son Triptolemus &amp; taught <a id="l1578"></a>him how to sow corn. He sowed it in Eleusine in a field called <a id="l1579"></a>Rharia from Rharus the father of Celeus, &amp; as the corn <a id="l1580"></a>increased he dispersed it over the cities of Greece, &amp; this was <a id="l1581"></a>the original of sowing corn in Greece. Afterwards Bacchus coming <a id="l1582"></a>into Greece taught them how to till the ground with oxen, for <a id="l1583"></a>at first they tilled it with their hand labour , tho some say that Ceres taught to plow with Oxen, confounding Isis with the Ceres of the Greeks.</p>

<p id="par70"> The Greeks <a id="l1707"></a>before the days of Pelasgus fed on hearbs &amp; roots, but meeting <a id="l1708"></a>often with such as were noxious, Pelasgus taught them to <a id="l1709"></a>feed upon the acorns of the Beech tree, &amp; this food continued <a id="l1710"></a>in use amongst them  till the plowing &amp; sowing of corn. <a id="l1711"></a>✝ And besides I do not find that the Greeks had any shipping so <a id="l1712"></a>early. The city Sidon having its name from  the fishes taken <a id="l1713"></a>on its coast might have fishing boats long before &amp; the Egypti<a id="l1714"></a>ans might have vessels of their papyr or flagg, but the <a id="l1715"></a>Greeks had  no manuel arts, <a id="l1716"></a>they  could neither build ships nor repair <a id="l1717"></a>those which came with colonies from other places, they had <a id="l1718"></a>no Smiths or Carpenters, no tools of iron or brass to work <a id="l1719"></a>with, no steel iron copper or brass to make tools of till <a id="l1720"></a>the Idæi Dactyli found out iron in mount Ida in Crete  in the days of Minos &amp; <a id="l1722"></a>Cadmus found out copper in  Bœotia from which <a id="l1723"></a>invention the copper-stone has ever since been called Cadmia. <a id="l1724"></a>And this makes me of opinion that when Myles  brought or procured corn <a id="l1725"></a>out of Sicily Libya or Egypt, he brought or procured from thence a Mill also to grind it, there being <a id="l1726"></a>at that time no artificers in Greece to make such an <a id="l1727"></a>engin.</p>
<p id="par71">And since Europa was carried  into Crete before the Cretans <a id="l1728"></a>  had tools of iron to build ships, it inclines me to  suspect that she was not stole <a id="l1729"></a>by the Cretans but came with a colony of Phenicians <a id="l1730"></a>to Crete under the conduct of her brother Atymnus about the same time that Cadmus &amp; his other brothers came with <a id="l1731"></a>other colonies to other places or a little before &amp; that the Idæi Dactyli <a id="l1732"></a>who found out iron &amp; many other things usefull for life<sup class="note" id="n141-ref">[141]</sup> were some of those Phœnicians who came with Atymnus &amp; Europa.

<p id="par78"><sup>‡</sup> I have now carried up the chronology of the Greeks <a id="l1813"></a>as high as the reigns of Actæus &amp; Cecrops, Inachus, Lelex, Ægyales, Pe<a id="l1814"></a>lasgus &amp; Deucalion &amp; this is as high as the first memory of things <a id="l1815"></a>done in Greece. For these were the oldest kings of Greece of which <a id="l1816"></a>there is any certain memory. They all flourished about 60 or 80 <a id="l1817"></a>years before Cadmus brought letters into Greece &amp; it is not to be <a id="l1818"></a>imagined things could be remembered which were done above <a id="l1819"></a>an hundred years before the use of letters. Chronologers make <a id="l1820"></a>the kingdoms of Sicyon &amp; Germany above 1000 years older then <a id="l1821"></a>the first use of letters in the reign of David &amp; that of <a id="l1822"></a>Argos above 800 years older &amp; that of Athens above 500 <a id="l1823"></a>years older. But how come they to know this? Could the <a id="l1824"></a>history of Athens be preserved for five hundred years together <a id="l1825"></a>without the use of letters? Or could Sicyon &amp; Germany remem<a id="l1826"></a>ber their originals five hundred years before Attica remembred <a id="l1827"></a>any thing of hers?  For we find by daily experience that the me<a id="l1828"></a>mory of such things as are not committed to writing wears out in <a id="l1829"></a>three or four generations. When letters first came in its reasonable <a id="l1830"></a>to believe that the Greeks  might commit to writing so much of <a id="l1831"></a>the antiquities of the several kingdoms of Greece as they could remember &amp;  by consequence that the antiquities of all those kingdoms might reach <a id="l1833"></a>up to  two, three or four generations before the coming in of letters <a id="l1834"></a>&amp; no higher.  Which single con<a id="l1835"></a>sideration overthrows the chronology of the Greeks &amp; confirms that <a id="l1836"></a>which we have delivered above. And the like has happened in Asia <a id="l1837"></a>minor. For Priamus king of Troy was the son of Laomedon the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p038r"> &lt;38r&gt; </span> son of Ilus the son of Tros the son of Erichthonius the son of <a id="l1838"></a>Dardanus the son in law of Teucer tions or about 160 years older then Priam &amp; so flourished in the days <a id="l1839"></a>of Eli or Samuel. For his successor Dardanus was the brother of Iasion who <a id="l1840"></a>lay with Ceres &amp; whose sister was said to be the wife of Cadmus. Erichtho<a id="l1841"></a>nius had a numerous breed of horses, &amp; may be that Erichthonius who is <a id="l1842"></a>delineated in the heavens. So also in Italy the first memory of things <a id="l1843"></a>reaches no highter then the days of Saturn &amp; Ianus who fourisched but two <a id="l1844"></a>or three generations before letters were brought in by Evander &amp; his <a id="l1845"></a>mother Carmenta. Let this therefore remain a truth that the anti<a id="l1846"></a>quities of the several kingdoms of Greece &amp; Troy &amp; of the Aborigi<a id="l1847"></a>nes in Italy reach about two or three or at most four generations <a id="l1848"></a>highter then the first use of Letters &amp; that there is no memory <a id="l1849"></a>of any thing done in Europe &amp; Asia minor before the  Hightprieshood <a id="l1850"></a>of Eli.</p>  
<p id="par79">And indeed Europe was not peopled very long before. For <a id="l1851"></a>Diodorus tells us the seven Islands called Æolided between Italy <a id="l1852"></a>&amp; Sicily were desert &amp; uninhabited till Liparus &amp; Æolus about the <a id="l1853"></a>time of the Trojan war went thither &amp; peopled them &amp; that <a id="l1854"></a>Malta &amp; Gaulus or Gaudus on the south side of Sicily were <a id="l1855"></a>first peopled by Phenicians &amp; so was Madera without the <a id="l1856"></a>straits. He tells us also that the Cyclade Islands were at first <a id="l1857"></a>desolate &amp; uninhabited but Minos the son of Europa king of <a id="l1858"></a>Crete having a powerfull fleet sent many colonies out of Crete &amp; <a id="l1859"></a>peopled many of the Cyclades &amp; particularly that Carpathus <a id="l1860"></a>was first seized by the soldiers of Minos. Syme lay wast &amp; <a id="l1861"></a>desolate till Triops came thither with a colony under Chthonius. <a id="l1862"></a>Strongylæ or Naxus was first inhabited by the Thracians <a id="l1863"></a>in the days of Boreas. Samus was at first desart &amp; inhabited <a id="l1864"></a>only by a great multitude of terrible wild beasts. Aristæus <a id="l1865"></a>who married Autonoe the daughter of Cadmus carried a <a id="l1866"></a>colony from Thebes into Cæa an island not inhabited before. <a id="l1867"></a>The island Rhodes was at first called Ophiusa being full of <a id="l1868"></a>Serpents before Phorbas a Prince of Argos went thither &amp; made it habitable by <a id="l1869"></a>destroying the serpents: in memory of which he is delineated in the <a id="l1870"></a>heavens in the constellation of Ophiuchus. The discovery of this <a id="l1871"></a>&amp; some other islands made a report that they rose out of <a id="l1872"></a>the sea. <em class="underline">Claræ jamdudum insulæ Delos &amp; Rhodos memoria <a id="l1873"></a>produntur enatæ; postea minores, ultra Melon Anaphe, inter <a id="l1874"></a>Lemnum &amp; Hellespontem Nea, inter Nebedum &amp; Teon Alone <a id="l1875"></a>&amp;c</em>: Plin. l. 2. c. 87. <em class="underline">In Asia Delos emersit &amp; Hiera et Anaphe <a id="l1876"></a>et Rhodus</em>: Ammian l. 17. And even the island Cyprus which <a id="l1877"></a>lay next to Phœnicia seems peopled not long before the days of <a id="l1878"></a>Cadmus. For Eratosthenes<sup class="note" id="n153-ref">[153]</sup> tells us that Cyprus was at first so <a id="l1879"></a>overgrown with wood that it could not be tilled, &amp; that they first <a id="l1880"></a>cut down the wood for melting of Copper &amp; Silver, afterwards <a id="l1881"></a>when they began to sail safely upon the mediterranean they <a id="l1882"></a>built ships &amp;  even navies of it, &amp; when by this means they <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p039r"> &lt;39r&gt; </span> could not destroy the wood they gave every man leave to cut <a id="l1883"></a>down what wood he pleased &amp; to possess all the grownd which he <a id="l1884"></a>cleared of wood. So Europe at first abounded very much with <a id="l1885"></a>woods, one of which called the Hercynian took up a great part of Ger<a id="l1886"></a>many being full nine days journeys broad &amp; above 40 long in Cæsars days. <a id="l1887"></a>but now those woods are almost cut down to make room for inhabitants, &amp; <a id="l1888"></a>this has been done since the invention of iron in the reign of Minos.</p>
<p id="par80">The first inhabitants of Greece lived in caves &amp; woods <a id="l1889"></a>without towns or houses, without arts or sciences like sauvages. <a id="l1890"></a>The Egyptians who came with Cecrops Lelex Inachus &amp; Pelasgus in the <a id="l1891"></a>days of Eli taught them to build houses or huts &amp; live together in <a id="l1892"></a>towns.  Doxius the son of Cælus taught <a id="l1894"></a>them to build houses of clay. The brothers Euryalus &amp; Hyperbius taught <a id="l1895"></a>them to harden they clay into bricks by burning &amp; build therewith. <a id="l1896"></a>In the days of Pelasgus they were taught to cloath themselves with <a id="l1897"></a>hogskins &amp; build cottages &amp; feed upon acorns of the beech instead of hearbs <a id="l1898"></a>&amp; roots; in the days of his son Lycaon that began to build cities <a id="l1899"></a>&amp; Lycaon built the city Lycosura which was the oldest city in <a id="l1900"></a>Greece; &amp; about the same time Cecrops &amp; Phoroneus built the cities Cecropia &amp; Phoronica &amp; in the next generation cities were multiplied, for the <a id="l1901"></a>sons of Lycaon  (who were many &amp; shared their fathers  kingdom) built every one of them <a id="l1902"></a>a city in his own dominion. And this was the state of Greece till  the Pheni<a id="l1903"></a>cians came with Cadmus in the reign of David &amp; brought in <a id="l1904"></a>letters &amp; corn &amp; agriculture &amp; metals &amp; armour &amp; navigation <a id="l1905"></a>&amp; merchandise &amp; astronomy &amp; poetry &amp; music &amp; dancing <a id="l1906"></a>&amp; chariots drawn with hores &amp; Olympic games &amp; festivals &amp; the Ampictyonic Council &amp; fairs <a id="l1907"></a>for buying &amp; selling &amp; sacred rites &amp; mysteries &amp; initiations <a id="l1908"></a>&amp;  sepulchers in the form of temples &amp; worshipping the dead &amp; the other arts &amp; sciences &amp; customes of <a id="l1909"></a>Phœnicia. The riches of Phenicia consisted much in metals <a id="l1910"></a>as may appear by the spoiles which David took from his <a id="l1911"></a>enemies. He took shields of gold &amp; very much copper <a id="l1912"></a>from the Syrians the countrymen of Cadmus; &amp; Toi king <a id="l1913"></a>of Hamath sent him a present of all manner of vessels of gold silver <a id="l1914"></a>&amp; copper, &amp; all this David dedicated to the Lord with the <a id="l1915"></a>silver &amp; the gold which he had taken from all the nations, <a id="l1916"></a>from Syria &amp; Edom &amp; Moab &amp; Ammon &amp; the Philistims <a id="l1917"></a>&amp; Amalec, amounting to  ten thousand talents of gold <a id="l1918"></a>&amp; an  hundred thousand talents of silver &amp; brass &amp; iron <a id="l1919"></a>without weight. And this sort of riches made the Phe<a id="l1920"></a>nicians skilfull in minerals &amp; in excocting &amp; manufacturing <a id="l1921"></a>metals &amp; put Cadmus &amp; his colonies upon searching in <a id="l1922"></a>the mountains for them. For Cadmus<sup class="note" id="n154-ref">[154]</sup>  taught how to mine &amp; dig up stones &amp; minerals &amp; excoct metals &amp; found <a id="l1923"></a>gold in the Panæa mountain &amp; from his finding copper the copperstone <a id="l1924"></a>hath ever since been called Cadmia. And copper being once found the <a id="l1925"></a> Phenicians were skilful in casting it into all sorts of utensils &amp;  <a id="l1926"></a>tools &amp; armour, 1 Kings 7.14. For the Greeks began to use armour of <a id="l1927"></a>copper before the invention of iron. And at the same time Tantalus &amp; the Pelopides grew rich by the metals of Phrygia &amp; Sipylus.<sup class="note" id="n155-ref">[155]</sup> Some say that Erichthonius found <a id="l1928"></a>out silver  and whether this was Erechthonius king of the Trojans <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p040r"> &lt;40r&gt; </span> or Erechtheus king of Athens, he flourished in the later end <a id="l1929"></a>of Davids reign &amp; beginning of Solomon's.

In the days of Minos the <a id="l1935"></a>son of Europa the Idæi Dactyli found out iron in mount <a id="l1936"></a>Ida in Crete, &amp; the Telchines coming from Cyprus into <a id="l1937"></a>Rhodes wrought iron &amp; copper there, &amp; others wrought <a id="l1938"></a>those metalls in Lemnos. For iron being once found <a id="l1939"></a>out, the Phœnicians were skilfull in manufacturing it <a id="l1940"></a>&amp; forming it into weapons &amp; into edged tools for hewing <a id="l1941"></a>&amp; carving of wood which gave Minos an opportunity of <a id="l1942"></a>building a fleet &amp; gaing the dominion of the  <a id="l1943"></a>Greek seas before any other Prince of Greece.

For the <a id="l2065"></a>Curetes<sup class="note" id="n164-ref">[164]</sup> &amp; particularly the Idæi Dactyli who found out iron <a id="l2066"></a>invented many other things usefull to life &amp; for their skill <a id="l2067"></a>&amp; knowledge &amp; mystical actions were accounted wise men &amp; <a id="l2068"></a>conjurers. In Phrygia their mysteries were about Rhea called <a id="l2069"></a>also Cybele &amp; magna Mater: in Crete they were about her <a id="l2070"></a>son Iupiter. They represented<sup class="note" id="n165-ref">[165]</sup> that when Iupiter was born <a id="l2071"></a>in Crete, his mother Rhea caused him to be educated in a cave <a id="l2072"></a>in  mount Ida under their care &amp; tuition &amp; that they <a id="l2073"></a>danced about him in armour with a great noise that his <a id="l2074"></a>father Saturn might no heare him cry, &amp; when he was <a id="l2075"></a>grown up assisted him in conquering his father Saturn &amp; in <a id="l2076"></a>memory of these things instituted their mysteries.</p>
<p id="par85">And hence I conclude the Iupiter of the Idæi Dacty<a id="l2077"></a>li was Minos, &amp; that the Rhea of the Phrygians was his mother Europa. For the Idæi Dactyli came into Crete with <a id="l2078"></a>Europa &amp; the brother Atymnus a little before Minos <a id="l2079"></a>was born, attended on him all his life, went with him <a id="l2080"></a>into Sicily &amp; were left there at his death. Asterius <a id="l2081"></a>&amp; Minos were the two first kings of all Crete mentioned <a id="l2082"></a>in history &amp; on that account the Saturn &amp; Iupiter of <a id="l2083"></a>the kingdom. Minos was the most potent &amp; famous of <a id="l2084"></a>all the kings of Crete &amp; so deserves the name of the <a id="l2085"></a>Cretan Iupiter above them all. He was the greatest <a id="l2086"></a>warrior &amp; most potent of all the kings of Greece in <a id="l2087"></a>that age &amp; the first who gained the dominion of <a id="l2088"></a>the seas &amp; therefore deserves above them all to be <a id="l2089"></a>painte with a scepter in one hand &amp; a thunderbolt in <a id="l2090"></a>the other. He was the law-maker of Crete &amp; was so <a id="l2091"></a>famous for justice as to be accounted the judge of hell <a id="l2092"></a>&amp; hence justice became the character of Iupiter. <a id="l2093"></a>Europa being a Phenician would be apt to commit <a id="l2094"></a>the care of her child to her countrimen the Curetes, <a id="l2095"></a>&amp; by their instruction he became so wise &amp; just. Mount <a id="l2096"></a>Ida was excavated by art with many walks &amp; intricate <a id="l2097"></a>passages which they called the Labyrinth, &amp; there they <a id="l2098"></a>might secure &amp; educate the child. There they might <a id="l2099"></a>dig minerals &amp; make armour &amp; after Minos was grown <a id="l2100"></a>up they might by the help of this armour overcome <a id="l2101"></a>the native Cretans, expell Asterius &amp; set Minos on <a id="l2102"></a>the throne &amp; then celebrate these actions by dancing <a id="l2103"></a>in armour at the sacrifices. He was buried in the same <a id="l2104"></a>cave where he was educated: for<sup class="note" id="n166-ref">[166]</sup> Pythagoras went down <a id="l2105"></a>into the Idæan cave to see his sepulchre. Whence Lucian<sup class="note" id="n167-ref">[167]</sup> <a id="l2106"></a>tells us that the Cretans do not only relate that Iupiter was <a id="l2107"></a>born &amp; build among them but also shew his sepulchre. <a id="l2108"></a>And Cicero<sup class="note" id="n168-ref">[168]</sup> in numbering three Iupiters, saith that the third was <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p044r"> &lt;44r&gt; </span>  the Cretan Iupiter Saturn's son whose se<a id="l2109"></a>pulchre was shown in Crete, &amp; the Scholiast upon Calli<a id="l2110"></a>machus<sup class="note" id="n169-ref">[169]</sup> lets us know that this was the sepulchre of Minos. <a id="l2111"></a>By Saturn Cicero who was a Latine, understands the <a id="l2112"></a>Saturn of the Latines: for when Saturn was expelled <a id="l2113"></a>his kingdom he fled from Crete by sea into Italy.

<p id="par86">About the same time that Saturn fled, some other Greeks <a id="l2117"></a>carried colonies into Italy, as Ianus who received Saturn into part <a id="l2118"></a>of his kingdom, &amp; Oenotrus the youngest son of Lycaan. And this <a id="l2119"></a>was the first memory of the things done in Italy,  the reign <a id="l2120"></a>of this Saturn before he was expelled by his son Iupiter, being the golden age of the Latines.</p>
<p id="par87">The Poets feigned that the old world perished by <a id="l2121"></a>Deucalion's flood &amp; was repaired by a new generation of <a id="l2122"></a>men arising from stones which Deucalion &amp; his wife cast <a id="l2123"></a>over their heads, &amp; called the four first ages of this new <a id="l2124"></a>world, the golden, the silver, the brazen &amp; the iron ages: <a id="l2125"></a>&amp; the Latines being colonies of the Cretans &amp; Greeks <a id="l2126"></a>carried their fables into Italy. Now the flood of Deu<a id="l2127"></a>calion was according to the Marble, about ten years <a id="l2128"></a>before the coming of Cadmus into Europe. &amp; by conse<a id="l2129"></a>quence the reign of Asterius fell in with the golden <a id="l2130"></a>age, as it ought to do. He was therefore the Saturn of <a id="l2131"></a>the Europeans &amp; their Iupiter who reigned in the silver <a id="l2132"></a>age was his son Minos.</p>
<p id="par88">Apollonius<sup class="note" id="n170-ref">[170]</sup> tells us that Chiron was begot of Phylira <a id="l2133"></a>by Saturn in the golden age when Iupiter was educa<a id="l2134"></a>ted  among the Idæi Dactyli, &amp; that<sup class="note" id="n171-ref">[171]</sup> Talus who was the son of Minos &amp; guarded the island Crete in armour <a id="l2136"></a>of copper, was the last man of the brazen age &amp; <a id="l2137"></a>died when the Argonauts in returning home arrived <a id="l2138"></a>at that island. These three ages therefore had a <a id="l2139"></a>particular respect to the kingdom of Crete in the days <a id="l2140"></a>of Asterius, Minos, &amp; the sons of Minos &amp; by conse<a id="l2141"></a>quence the fourth age was the age in which the grandsons of Minos <a id="l2142"></a>flourished: for Hesiod<sup class="note" id="n172-ref">[172]</sup> tells us expresly that the fourth <a id="l2143"></a>age ended with the warrs  at Thebes &amp; Troy.</p> 
<p id="par89">Hesiod<sup class="note" id="n173-ref">[173]</sup> describes these four ages to be four generations <a id="l2144"></a>of men every one of which ended when the men of the ge<a id="l2145"></a>neration dropt into the earth &amp; were deified &amp; a <a id="l2146"></a>new generation arose, &amp; saith that he himself lived <a id="l2147"></a>in the fift age which should be destroyed by Iupiter <a id="l2148"></a>when the men of that age should grow hoary headed; <a id="l2149"></a>&amp; describing every age to be worse then the former <a id="l2150"></a>he translates the name of the iron age from the fourth <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p045r"> &lt;45r&gt; </span> to his own as being the worst of the five. And since Chiron <a id="l2151"></a>was born in the golden age &amp; lived till the Argonautic <a id="l2152"></a>expedition or a little longer, the silver age &amp; copper <a id="l2153"></a>age could not exceed the length of ordinary generations. <a id="l2154"></a> The golden age began with  the coming of Europa &amp; the Curetes into Crete <a id="l2155"></a> in the reign of Asterius, or with the beginning <a id="l2156"></a>of his reign over all Crete. From thence to the destruction <a id="l2157"></a>of Troy was about 134 years, which being divided into four <a id="l2158"></a>equal ages allows about 33 or 34 years to an age or <a id="l2159"></a>an hundred years to three ages, &amp; of this length were <a id="l2160"></a>the two first ages together, extending to the death of <a id="l2161"></a>Minos; the third age extending from the death of <a id="l2162"></a>Minos to the end of the Argonautic expedition; &amp; <a id="l2163"></a>the fourth age extending from thence to the taking <a id="l2164"></a>of Troy.</p>
<p id="par90">In the first of these four ages men lived on <a id="l2165"></a>the spontaneous fruits of the earth without the labour <a id="l2166"></a>of plowing &amp; sowing. In the second the Greeks began <a id="l2167"></a>to plow &amp; sow &amp; grow potent at sea &amp; by the invention <a id="l2168"></a>of iron to multiply arts. In the third they grew more war<a id="l2169"></a>like but used armour &amp; utensils of copper, the use of <a id="l2170"></a>iron, as Hesiod lets us know, being not yet spread abroad. <a id="l2171"></a>In the end of the third &amp; beginning of the fourth <a id="l2172"></a>they built a long ship &amp; invented the Constellations &amp; <a id="l2173"></a>began to make long voyages at sea. In the fourth <a id="l2174"></a>they increased their riches in metalls improved navi<a id="l2175"></a>gation &amp; grew more injurious &amp; violent then before. <a id="l2176"></a>And these are the characters of the four ages ac<a id="l2177"></a>cording to the Poets.</p>
<p id="par91">The people of Elis<sup class="note" id="n174-ref">[174]</sup> in giving an account if their <a id="l2178"></a>own originals, say that Saturn reigned first in the king<a id="l2179"></a>dom of heaven, &amp; that the men who were called the <a id="l2180"></a>golden age built a temple to him in Olympia, &amp; <a id="l2181"></a>that his wife Rhea when Iupiter was born committed <a id="l2182"></a>the custody of the child to the Idæi Dactyli other<a id="l2183"></a>wise called Curetes, &amp; that five of these Idæi Dac<a id="l2184"></a>tyli (whose names were Hercules, Pœonius, Epimedes, <a id="l2185"></a>Iasius &amp; Idas) coming afterwards from Ida a mountain <a id="l2186"></a>in Crete into Elis, there instituted the game of <a id="l2187"></a>racing once in four years, which was the original <a id="l2188"></a>of the Olympic games.

Now <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n191-ref">[191]</sup> Erechtheus <a id="l2259"></a>in a time of famin procured a great quantity of corn from <a id="l2260"></a>Egypt &amp; for this benefaction the people of Athens made <a id="l2261"></a>him their king: &amp; therefore the trafic of carrying corn <a id="l2262"></a>from Egypt to Greece began before his reign &amp; by conse<a id="l2263"></a>quence in or a little before the reign of Cadmus.</p>
<p id="par97">When the Phenicians brought corn from Egypt <a id="l2264"></a>into Greece they would be apt to bring weomen out of <a id="l2265"></a>Egypt to instruct &amp; assist the Greeks in the making of <a id="l2266"></a>bread for promoting the merchandise of the corn, espe<a id="l2267"></a>cially when they brought a great quantity of corn out <a id="l2268"></a>of Egypt for  Erechtheus. For<sup class="note" id="n192-ref">[192]</sup> at <a id="l2269"></a>that time Ceres is said to have come to Athens. She <a id="l2270"></a>pretended to come in quest of her daughter who per<a id="l2271"></a>haps had been carried away by  Merchants, &amp; under that <a id="l2272"></a>pretense travelled from Athens to Eleusis, &amp; being there <a id="l2273"></a>enterteined by the daughters of Celeus king of Eleusis <a id="l2274"></a>nurst up &amp; instructed his young son Triptolemus and <a id="l2275"></a>taught him how to sow corn.

This war there<a id="l2289"></a>for putting an end to the reign of Erechtheus, seems to have <a id="l2290"></a>been about the middle of Solomons reign, for Erechtheus reigned <a id="l2291"></a>long. Then reigned his sons Cecrops &amp; Pandion in the days of <a id="l2292"></a>Solomon &amp; Ægeus in the days of Rehoboam. Pandion had war <a id="l2293"></a>with Labdacus the grandson of Cadmus.</p>
<p id="par99">Arcas<sup class="note" id="n196-ref">[196]</sup> the son of Callisto the daughter of Lycaon the <a id="l2294"></a>son of Pelasgus received corn from Triptolemus &amp; taught his <a id="l2295"></a>people to sow &amp; make bread of it, &amp; therefore Arcas may <a id="l2296"></a>be recconed contemporary to Solomon or Rehoboam &amp; Pelasgus to <a id="l2297"></a>Samuel &amp; Saul. Triptolemus<sup class="note" id="n197-ref">[197]</sup> also conveyed corn to  to Eumelus <a id="l2298"></a>the first king of Achaia, &amp; taught him &amp; his son Agriculture &amp; how to build a city, &amp; Eumolus named the city Aroas from the tillage of the earth</p>
<p id="par100">In the reign of Car<sup class="note" id="n198-ref">[198]</sup> the son of Phoroneus Temples were <a id="l2299"></a>first erected to Ceres in Megara &amp; Car erected a Temple to <a id="l2300"></a>her there, &amp; therefore Car was contemporary to Solomon &amp; <a id="l2301"></a>Phoroneus to David as above.</p>
<p id="par101">Erechtheus was<sup class="note" id="n199-ref">[199]</sup> the son of Pandion the son of Erichthonius <a id="l2302"></a>&amp; I take Erichthonius to be an Egyptian. For he first of any <a id="l2303"></a>man taught the Greeks to draw a chariot with horses: which inven<a id="l2304"></a>tion came from Libya &amp; Egypt. And as Cecrops to denote <a id="l2305"></a>him a foreigner of unknown parents was called ἀυτόχθων the son of the <a id="l2306"></a>earth, &amp; to signify that he was of two nations &amp; languages <a id="l2307"></a>the Egyptian &amp; the Greek, was represented a man above &amp; a <a id="l2308"></a>serpent below, so was Erechthonius. The Greeks,  not <a id="l2309"></a>knowing his parents derived him from foreigners Vulcan &amp; Mi<a id="l2310"></a>nerva by a miraculous birth of the earth, &amp; the Egyptians recconed his <a id="l2311"></a>grandson Erechtheus<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n200-ref">[200]</sup> to be  an Egyptian by his family. Now <a id="l2312"></a>Erechthonius being two generations,  or about 50 <span class="smaller">or 60</span> years, <a id="l2313"></a>older then Erechtheus may be recconed contemporary to <a id="l2314"></a>Samuel &amp; Saul: but I do not take him or his son Pandi<a id="l2315"></a>on to have been king of Athens. Erechtheus seems to <a id="l2316"></a>have been the first of the family who  was king of that City: for <a id="l2317"></a>he was elected king for procuring a great quantity of corn <a id="l2318"></a>from Egypt in a famin as above, &amp; then he changed the <a id="l2319"></a>name of the people from Cranaans to Athenians.<sup class="note" id="n201-ref">[201]</sup> Vnder <a id="l2320"></a>Cecrops they were called Cecropians, under Cranaus Cranaans, <a id="l2321"></a>under Erechtheus Athenians &amp; under Cecrops II &amp; Ion Ionians.<sup class="note" id="n202-ref">[202]</sup> <a id="l2322"></a>Every new king in those days giving a new name to the <a id="l2323"></a>people. And therefore I reccon not Erechthonius but Erechtheus <a id="l2324"></a> to have been the successor of Amphictyon:  Cranaus the predecessor of Amphictyon was the father of Rharus the father of <a id="l2328"></a>Celeus &amp; therefore scarce two generations older then Erech<a id="l2329"></a>theus. And if Cecrops  be recconed about 10 or 20 years older then  his successor Cranaus <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p051r"> &lt;51r&gt; </span> , he will be contemporary to Samuel. <a id="l2330"></a></p>
<p id="par102">So then Cecrops, Erechthonius &amp; Lelex were contem<a id="l2331"></a>porary to Samuel &amp; in his reign led colonies from Egypt <a id="l2332"></a>into Greece. Its probable that when the Theban army <a id="l2333"></a>under Misphragmuthosis invaded &amp; subdued the lower <a id="l2334"></a>Egypt &amp; a great body of the shepherds retired to Abaris <a id="l2335"></a>&amp; were there shup up, others (amongst whom were Cecrops <a id="l2336"></a>Erechthonius &amp; Lelex &amp; perhaps Pelasgus) escaped out <a id="l2337"></a>of the Canobic ostium of the Nile in such vessels as <a id="l2338"></a>they could meet with upon that river &amp; fled to Libya <a id="l2339"></a>Phenicia, Cyprus, Asia minor &amp; Greece. For the Athe<a id="l2340"></a>nians were recconed a colony of Egyptians coming from <a id="l2341"></a>Sais a Province of Egypt upon the Canobic ostium of <a id="l2342"></a>the Nile. These lived for a while without commerce <a id="l2343"></a>with Phenicia &amp; Egypt &amp; only endeavoured to reduce <a id="l2344"></a>the Greeks from a salavage way of live, but in the next <a id="l2345"></a>generation a trade was opened between Greece &amp; Phœnicia <a id="l2346"></a>whereby the Greeks began to be supplied with corn &amp; <a id="l2347"></a>other merchandise from Phenicia &amp; Egypt. And then <a id="l2348"></a>the Phenicians being pressed by the wars of David sent <a id="l2349"></a>out new colonies, Cadmus led a colony into Bœotia, &amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n203-ref">[203]</sup> left ano<a id="l2350"></a>ther in Rhodes, &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n204-ref">[204]</sup> another under his brother Thasus in <a id="l2351"></a>the Island Thasus neare Thrace &amp; his companion <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n205-ref">[205]</sup> Pro<a id="l2352"></a>teus led another into Bisaltia in Thrace &amp; Cilix at <a id="l2353"></a>the same time <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n206-ref">[206]</sup> led another into Cilicia &amp; Membliarus <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n207-ref">[207]</sup> another into the Island Thera neare Crete</p>
<p id="par103">Cecrops is therefore justly recconed one of the first <a id="l2354"></a>Egyptians who led colonies into Greece. He joyned one man <a id="l2355"></a>&amp; one woman &amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n208-ref">[208]</sup> first called Iupiter God &amp; set up an <a id="l2356"></a>altar at Athens &amp; after him came the whole gene<a id="l2357"></a>alogy of the Gods of Greece. He was the first that civi<a id="l2358"></a>lized the people of Attica &amp; gathered them into cities, <a id="l2359"></a>Phoroneus the first that built cities about Argos, Poly<a id="l2360"></a>caon the son of Lelex the first that built cities in <a id="l2361"></a>Messene &amp; Lycaon the son of Pelasgus the first that built cities in Arcadia. <a id="l2362"></a>Their fathers Inachus Lelex &amp; Pelasgus were the first kings &amp; began to civilize their people &amp; the sons assembled them in cities &amp; by this circumstance you may know that these men <a id="l2363"></a>lived much about the same time. Cecrops in sailing from <a id="l2364"></a>Egypt  the sea coasts came first to Phenicia <a id="l2365"></a>&amp; Cyprus &amp; then to Greece. He seems to be one of the <a id="l2366"></a>Shepherds because <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n209-ref">[209]</sup> a colony which he left in Cyprus <a id="l2367"></a>sacrificed yearly a man to his daughter Agraulus, an <a id="l2368"></a>impiety which the genuine Egyptians were free from. <a id="l2369"></a>By the like colonies the sacrificing of men came also <a id="l2370"></a>into Greece. For Erechtheus <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n210-ref">[210]</sup> sacrificed his daughter &amp; there
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p052r"> &lt;52r&gt; </span>fore his family was of the race of the shepherds. But <a id="l2371"></a>circumcision (the  religion of the genuine Egyptians) was no<a id="l2372"></a>where in Greece introduced by any of the colonies. When <a id="l2373"></a>Cecrops came first into Greece, the Cares sailed between <a id="l2374"></a>the Islands of the Cyclades &amp; infested the sea-coasts of <a id="l2375"></a>Attica. And this navigation made way for the trade between <a id="l2376"></a>Greece &amp; Phenicia &amp; the rapture of Io &amp; Europa.</p>
<p id="par104">Cadmus pretending to be sent in quest of his sister <a id="l2377"></a>Europa  &amp; coming into Phocis <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n211-ref">[211]</sup> followed an Ox which he <a id="l2378"></a>had bought of the heardsmen of Pelagon &amp; which was <a id="l2379"></a>marked on both sides with a white spot resembling <a id="l2380"></a>the full Moon. This was in imitation of the Ox Apis &amp; <a id="l2381"></a>shews that he was of the religion of the Egyptians who <a id="l2382"></a>worshipped that Ox. And thence its probable that as the <a id="l2383"></a>Israelites in the time of Moses &amp; Ieroboam in the time <a id="l2384"></a>of Solomon by staying in Egypt learnt the worship of <a id="l2385"></a>the calf so did the ancestors of  Cadmus in the reign <a id="l2386"></a>of the shepherds. Strabo<sup class="note" id="n212-ref">[212]</sup> lets us know that the people which <a id="l2387"></a>accompanied Cadmus into Europe were mixt of Phenicians <a id="l2388"></a>&amp; Arabians: which Arabians I take to be such as fled from <a id="l2389"></a>the red sea &amp; other places to Zidon in the wars of David. <a id="l2390"></a>Conon in his 32<sup>th</sup> Narration saith that when Cadmus was <a id="l2391"></a>sent to seek Europa he was accompanied with Proteus who <a id="l2392"></a>fearing the  tyranny of Busiris came with Cadmus <a id="l2393"></a>out of Egypt, &amp; married Chrysonome the daughter of Clytus <a id="l2394"></a>king of a region in Thrace &amp; by the assistance of Clytus <a id="l2395"></a>expelled the Bisaltes &amp; became king of their country.</p>
<p id="par105">Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n213-ref">[213]</sup> tells us that the Gephyreans, as they them<a id="l2396"></a>selves reported, were originally from Erythræa. But, saith he, <a id="l2397"></a>by inquiring, I find that they were Phenicians who came <a id="l2398"></a>with Cadmus into Bœotia &amp; dwelt in the Tanagrian country, <a id="l2399"></a>&amp; being expelled thence first by the Argives &amp; then by <a id="l2400"></a>the Bœotians they retired to Athens where they built <a id="l2401"></a>Temples which had nothing common with other temples but were <a id="l2402"></a>distinct. He adds that the Phenicians who came with Cadmus <a id="l2403"></a>of whom the Gephyreans were a part, brought many doctrines <a id="l2404"></a>into Greece, &amp; particularly letters, &amp; that the Iones learnt <a id="l2405"></a>letters of the Phenicians &amp; called them Phœnician letters. <a id="l2406"></a>Since these Gephyrians were originally Erythreans, its <a id="l2407"></a>probable that the city Erythræ in Bœotia was built by <a id="l2408"></a>Erythreans who came with Cadmus.</p>
<p id="par106">Some think that the letters which Cadmus brought <a id="l2409"></a> from Phenicia came originally from Egypt, which is impro<a id="l2410"></a>bable because Cecrops Erichthonius &amp; Lelex came from <a id="l2411"></a>Egypt before without letters. Navigation &amp; Merchandise occasioned <a id="l2412"></a>the invention of Astronomy &amp; Arithmetic, &amp; Letters were <a id="l2413"></a>as necessary to a Merchant, &amp; therefore its reasonable <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p053r"> &lt;53r&gt; </span> to ascribe the invention of all these things to the Phœnicians <a id="l2414"></a>or if you please to the inhabitants of the red sea who <a id="l2415"></a>were the first merchants. Then Moses might learn them <a id="l2416"></a>when he dwelt in the land of Midian &amp; from thence the <a id="l2417"></a>Erytheans might bring them into Phenicia.</p>
<p id="par107">Conon in his 37<sup>th</sup> Narration tells us that when Cadmus <a id="l2418"></a>was sent by the king of the Phenicians to seek Europa <a id="l2419"></a>the Phenicians were very potent &amp; having conquered a <a id="l2420"></a>great part of Asia placed their royal seat at the Egypti<a id="l2421"></a>an Thebes. Whence I learn that the kingdom of Egypt <a id="l2422"></a>seated at Thebes was founded &amp; grew potent about the <a id="l2423"></a>times of Agenor &amp; Cadmus &amp; that when they conquered <a id="l2424"></a>Asia they first subdued Phenicia &amp; made it a Province <a id="l2425"></a>of Egypt, so that the Phenicians spake of the kingdom of <a id="l2426"></a>Egypt &amp; its conquests as their own.</p>
<p id="par108">For Cepheus  &amp; his daughter Andromeda contemporary to  Perseus <a id="l2427"></a> Perseus . And Apollodorus makes this Cepheus &amp; his brother <a id="l2430"></a>Phineus to be the sons of Belus a king of Egypt the <a id="l2431"></a>same Belus who was reputed the brother of Agenor the <a id="l2432"></a>father of Cadmus &amp; Europa. Be the genealogy true or <a id="l2433"></a>false it shews that the ancients derived the family of <a id="l2434"></a>Cepheus from Egypt. He was accounted an Ethiopian, that <a id="l2435"></a>is an Egyptian of Thebais. Now Conon in his 40<sup>th</sup> Narra<a id="l2436"></a>tion saith that Cepheus the father of Andromeda <a id="l2437"></a>reigned from the Mediterranean to the Red sea, &amp; that <a id="l2438"></a>his kingdom was called Ioppa from  the city Ioppa <a id="l2439"></a>upon the Mediterranean. And Stephanus in Ιόπη tells <a id="l2440"></a>us that this city was built by Cepheus. And Solinus c. 47. <a id="l2441"></a>that they there shewed the rock to which Andromeda was chained. From all which it seems that Cepheus being of the Royal family of the kings of Egypt was by them placed at Ioppa &amp; reigned over the Phenicians, building Ioppa for the seat of his kingdom &amp; that in his days the Egyptians conquered Asia.</p>
<p id="par109">Among the sons of Belus the Greeks also reccon <a id="l2442"></a>Ægyptus &amp; Danaus &amp; therefore they flourished after <a id="l2443"></a>the coming of Cadmus into Europe &amp; were contemporary <a id="l2444"></a>to Cepheus. Belus in the language of the Egyptians &amp; Libyans is <a id="l2445"></a>Amnon, or (as the Greeks &amp; Latines call him) Iupiter Amon; <a id="l2446"></a>&amp; his wife <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n214-ref">[214]</sup> Iuno Ammonia &amp; therefore Ammon was the father of Ægyptus Danaus &amp; <a id="l2447"></a>Cepheus &amp; brother of Agenor. In his reign happened the <a id="l2448"></a>story of Agenor &amp; Cadmus &amp; in the next reign the story <a id="l2449"></a>of Ægyptus Danaus &amp; Cepheus. Now Manetho <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n215-ref">[215]</sup> tells us <a id="l2450"></a>that Ægyptus &amp; Danaus were Sethosis &amp; Armais, &amp; that <a id="l2451"></a>Sethosis having forces by sea &amp; land left the govern<a id="l2452"></a>ment of Egypt to his brother Armais while he invaded <a id="l2453"></a>&amp; conquered Cyprus, Phœnicia, Media, Persia &amp; other nati<a id="l2454"></a>ons.

And there<a id="l2467"></a>fore Sesostris reigned after the rapture of Europa &amp; by <a id="l2468"></a>consequence after the days of Saul,  David &amp; Solomon. For <a id="l2469"></a>Herodotus saw some of Sesostris his pillars erected in Pa<a id="l2470"></a>lestine in memory of his conquering that country, &amp; such <a id="l2471"></a>a conquest cannot agree either to the warlike &amp; victorious reigns <a id="l2472"></a>of Saul &amp; David or the peaceable &amp; flourishing reign <a id="l2473"></a>of Solomon; nor is there any mention of an invasion <a id="l2474"></a>of Iudea by the Egyptians in the days of the Iudges <a id="l2475"></a>or at any time before the fift year of Rehoboam. And <a id="l2476"></a>on the other hand, all antiquity reccon Sesostris older <a id="l2477"></a>then the Trojan war, &amp; something older then the Argo<a id="l2478"></a>nautic expedition.  The Greeks built the ship Argo <a id="l2479"></a>after the patern of the long ship in which Danaus upon <a id="l2480"></a>the return of Ægyptus or Sesostris into Egypt sailed <a id="l2481"></a>with his fifty daughters to Greece &amp; Argus the son of Danaus was the master builder.<sup class="note" id="n216-ref">[216]</sup>.

<p id="par112">The same king is confirmed by Iospehus<sup class="note" id="n217-ref">[217]</sup> who affirms <a id="l2486"></a>that Herodotus ascribes to Sesostris the actions of Sesak <a id="l2487"></a>erring only in the name of the king. Which is all one <a id="l2488"></a>as to say that Sesak was that conqueror whom Hero<a id="l2489"></a>redotus calls Sesostris. The old Scholiast of Apollonius Rhodius<sup class="note" id="n218-ref">[218]</sup> out of Dicæarchus calls him Sesonchosis, saying that Sesonchosis <a id="l2490"></a>who was king of all Egypt &amp; reigned after Orus the <a id="l2491"></a>son of Osiris &amp; Isis,  conquered all Asia &amp; a great <a id="l2492"></a>part of Europe, &amp; erected pillars of his conquests, &amp; <a id="l2493"></a>made laws &amp; found out horsmanship &amp; left a colony <a id="l2494"></a>at Æa with laws writ in Tables &amp; with Geographical <a id="l2495"></a>Tables of his conquests by land &amp; sea, &amp; that Theopom<a id="l2496"></a>pus calls him Sesostris.

Amasis &amp; Actisanes an Ethiopian <a id="l2559"></a>who conquered him, I take to be the same with Anysis <a id="l2560"></a>&amp; Sabacus in Herodotus. Osimanduas is the same with Menes in <a id="l2561"></a>Herodotus.

If by the four sons of Mizraim you understand <a id="l2806"></a>not four single men but four nations sprung from Mizraim <a id="l2807"></a>which at first had kings in every city &amp; at length grew <a id="l2808"></a>into the four kingdoms above mentioned: there may be much <a id="l2809"></a>of truth in this history. The people of Coptus might conquer &amp; reign over <a id="l2810"></a>all the upper Egypt from Coptus to Syene, &amp; afterwards they <a id="l2811"></a>might conquer the middle part of <a id="l2812"></a>Egypt down to Memphys, <a id="l2813"></a>&amp; then the lower Egypt expelling the shepherds, &amp; lastly <a id="l2814"></a>the people of Sais &amp; Libya as far as the lesser Syrtes.

<p id="par130">As the Gods or ancient kings &amp; Princes of Greece Egypt &amp; Syria <a id="l2820"></a>of Damascus have been made much ancienter then the truth, sp <a id="l2821"></a>have those of Chaldea &amp; Assyria. For Diodorus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n224-ref">[224]</sup> tells us that when <a id="l2822"></a>Alexander the great was in Asia the Chaldeans <a id="l2823"></a>recconed 473000 years since they first began to observe the motion of <a id="l2824"></a>the stars. And Ctesias &amp; the ancient Greek &amp; Latin writers <a id="l2825"></a>who copy from him, have made the Assyrian Empire as old <a id="l2826"></a>as Noah's flood within 60 or 70 years &amp; tell us the names of <a id="l2827"></a>all the kings of Assyria down  from his feigned son Ninus to <a id="l2828"></a>Sardanapalus the last king of that Monarchy. But the names <a id="l2829"></a>of his kings except one or two, have no afinity with the <a id="l2830"></a>names of the Assyrians mentioned in scripture. For the <a id="l2831"></a>Assyrians were usually named after their Gods Bel or Pul, <a id="l2832"></a>Chaddon, Haddon, Adon or Adonis, Melech or Moloch, Atsur or <a id="l2833"></a>Assur, Nebo, Nergal, Merodach; as in these names Pul, <a id="l2834"></a>Tiglath-Ppul-assur, Salmon-asser, Adra-melech, Shar-asser, <a id="l2835"></a>Asser-haddon, Sardanapalus or Asser-haddon-pul, Nabonasser <a id="l2836"></a>or Nabo-adon-asser, Bel-adan, Chiniladan or Chen-el-<a id="l2837"></a>adon, <a id="l2838"></a>Nabo-pul-asser, Nebu-chadon-asser, Nebuzaradon <a id="l2839"></a>or Nebo-asser-adon, Nergal-asser, Nergal-shar-asser <a id="l2840"></a>Labo-asser-dach, Shesheb-asser, Beltes-asser, Evil-mero<a id="l2841"></a>dach, Shamgar-nebo, Rabsaris or Rab-asser, Nebu-shasban, <a id="l2842"></a>Mardo cempad or Merodac-empad. Such were the Assyrian <a id="l2843"></a>names: but those in the Canon of Ctesias are of another sort, <a id="l2844"></a>except Sardanapalus whose name he had met with in Hero<a id="l2845"></a>dotus. He makes  Semiramis as old as <a id="l2846"></a>the first Belus, but Herodotus tells us that she was but five <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p062r"> &lt;62r&gt; </span> generations older then the mother of Labynitus. He represents <a id="l2847"></a>that the city Ninus was founded by a man of the same name <a id="l2848"></a>&amp; Babylon by Semiramis: whereas either Nimrod or Assur <a id="l2849"></a>founded those &amp; other cities without giving his own name <a id="l2850"></a>to any  of them. He makes the Assyrian Empire con<a id="l2851"></a>tinue about 1360 years, whereas Herodotus tells us that <a id="l2852"></a>it lasted but 500 years, &amp; the numbers of Herodotus <a id="l2853"></a>concerning those old time are all of them too long. He <a id="l2854"></a>makes Nineveh destroyed by the Medes &amp; Babylonians <a id="l2855"></a>three hundred years before the reign of Astibares &amp; <a id="l2856"></a>Nebuchadnezzar who destroyed it, &amp; sets down the names <a id="l2857"></a>of seven or eight feigned Kings of Media between the <a id="l2858"></a>destruction of Nineveh &amp; the reigns of Astibaris &amp; Ne<a id="l2859"></a>buchadnezzar as if the empire of the Medes erected upon <a id="l2860"></a>the ruins of the Assyrian Empire had lasted 300 years <a id="l2861"></a>whereas it lasted but 72. And the true empire of the <a id="l2862"></a>Assyrians described in scripture, whose kings were Pul, <a id="l2863"></a>Tiglathpulasser, Salmonasser, Senacherib, Asserhaddon &amp;c <a id="l2864"></a>he mentions not tho much nearer to his own times: <a id="l2865"></a>which shews that he was ignorant of the antiquities of <a id="l2866"></a>the Assyrians. Yet something of truth there is in the <a id="l2867"></a>bottom of some of his stories as there uses to be in Ro<a id="l2868"></a>mances; as that Nineveh was destroyed by the Medes &amp; <a id="l2869"></a>Babylonians, that Sardanapalus was the last king of all <a id="l2870"></a>the Assyrian empire, that Astibares &amp; Astyages were <a id="l2871"></a>kings of the Medes: but he has made all things too an<a id="l2872"></a>cient, &amp; out of vain glory taken too great a liberty <a id="l2873"></a>in feigning names &amp; stories to please his reader.</p>
<p id="par131">When the Iews were newly returned from the Ba<a id="l2874"></a>bylonian captivity, the confessed their sins in this man<a id="l2875"></a>ner. <em class="underline">Now therefore, our God</em>, ––––––– <em class="underline">let not all the trouble <a id="l2876"></a>seem littel before thee which hath come upon us, on our <a id="l2877"></a>kings, on our Princes, &amp; on our Priests, &amp; on our Prophets, <a id="l2878"></a>&amp; on our fathers &amp; on all thy people since the time of <a id="l2879"></a>the kings of Assyria unto this day</em> (Nehem. IX.32) that is <a id="l2880"></a>since the time of the kingdom of Assyria, or since the rise <a id="l2881"></a>of that Empire. And therefore the Assyrian Empire arose <a id="l2882"></a>when the kings of Assyria began to afflict the inhabitants <a id="l2883"></a>of Palestine: which was in the days of Pul. He &amp; his suc<a id="l2884"></a>cessors afflicted Israel &amp; conquered the nations round about <a id="l2885"></a>&amp; upon the ruin of many small &amp; ancient kingdoms erec<a id="l2886"></a>ted their empire, conquering the Medes as well as <a id="l2887"></a>other nations. But of these conquests Ctesias knew not <a id="l2888"></a>a word, no not so much as the names of the conquerors, <a id="l2889"></a>or that there was an Assyrian Empire then standing. <a id="l2890"></a>For he supposes that the Medes reigned at that time, &amp; that <a id="l2891"></a>the Assyrian Empire was at an end above 250 years <a id="l2892"></a>before it began.</p>
<p id="par132">However, we must allow that Nimrod founded a kingdom <a id="l2893"></a>at Babylon &amp;, perhaps extended it into Assyria. But this king<a id="l2894"></a>dom was but of small extent if compared with the Empires <a id="l2895"></a>which rose up afterwards. And if it had been greater yet it <a id="l2896"></a>was but of short continuance, it being the custome in those <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p063r"> &lt;63r&gt; </span> early ages for every father to divide his territories amongst his <a id="l2897"></a>sons. So Cham was king of all Afric &amp; Iaphet of all Asia minor <a id="l2898"></a>&amp; Europe, but they left no standing kingdoms. After the days of <a id="l2899"></a>Nimrod we hear no more of the Assyrians or of Nineveh or Ba<a id="l2900"></a>bylon till the days of Ionah. In the time of the Iudges of Israel <a id="l2901"></a>&amp; reign of David we find Syria &amp; Mesopotamia subject to kings <a id="l2902"></a>of other cities &amp; Hadadezer king of Zobah reigned on both sides Euphrates (Iud. III.8 2 Sam. VIII &amp; X.) The kingdoms of Israel <a id="l2903"></a>Moab, Ammon, Edom, Philistia, Sidon, Damascus &amp; Hamath the <a id="l2904"></a>great, continued subject to other Lords till the reign of Pul &amp; <a id="l2905"></a>his successors, &amp; so did the house of Eden (Amos. I.5. 2 King. XIX.<a id="l2906"></a>12) &amp; Haran or Carrhæ (Gen. XII. 2 King. XIX.12) &amp; Sepharvaim <a id="l2907"></a>in Mesopotamia &amp; Calneh neare Bagdag (Gen. X.10 Isa. X.8. <a id="l2908"></a>2 King. XVII.31.) Sesak &amp; Memnon were great conquerors in <a id="l2909"></a>the east, but in their  histories there's not a word of an <a id="l2910"></a>Assyrian empire then standing to oppose them. On the con<a id="l2911"></a>trary  Susiana Media Persia, Bactria, Armenia &amp; Cappadocia continued subject to the kings of Egypt till the reign of Mocris as above. Homer mentions <a id="l2913"></a>Bacchus &amp; Memnon kings of Egypt &amp; Persia, but knew <a id="l2914"></a>nothing of an Assyrian empire. Ionah prophesied when <a id="l2915"></a>Israel was in affliction under the king of Syria, &amp; this <a id="l2916"></a>was in the latter part of the reign of Iehoahaz &amp; first <a id="l2917"></a>part of the reign of Ioas kings of Israel, &amp; by consequence <a id="l2918"></a>about 120 years before the captivity of the ten tribes. Nineveh <a id="l2919"></a>was then a city of large extent, but full of pastures for <a id="l2920"></a>cattel, so that it conteined but about 120000 persons. <a id="l2921"></a> It was not yet grown so great &amp; <a id="l2922"></a>potent as not to be terrified at the preaching of Ionah, <a id="l2923"></a>to fear being invaded by its neighbours &amp; ruined within <a id="l2924"></a>forty days. Its king was not yet called king of <em class="underline">Assyria</em> <a id="l2925"></a>but only king of <em class="underline">Nineveh</em> (Ionah III.6, 7) &amp; his Proclamation <a id="l2926"></a>for a fast was not  published in several nations, nor <a id="l2927"></a>in all Assyria but only in Nineveh &amp; perhaps the villa<a id="l2928"></a>ges thereof: but soon after when the dominion of <a id="l2929"></a>Nineveh was established at home &amp; exalted over all <a id="l2930"></a>Assyria properly so called, &amp; this kingdom began to make <a id="l2931"></a>war upon the neighbouring nations, its kings were no <a id="l2932"></a>longer called kings of Nineveh but kings of Assyria.</p>
<p id="par133">Amos prophesied in the reign of Ieroboam the son of Ioas <a id="l2933"></a>king of Israel soon after Ieroboam had subdued the kingdoms <a id="l2934"></a>of Damascus &amp; Hamath, that is, about 70 or 80 years before <a id="l2935"></a>the captivity of the ten Tribes, &amp; he thus reproves Israel for <a id="l2936"></a>being lifter up by these conquests.<sup class="note" id="n225-ref">[225]</sup> <em class="underline">Ye which rejoice in a thing <a id="l2937"></a>of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our <a id="l2938"></a>strength? Behold I will raise up against you a nation, O <a id="l2939"></a>house of Israel, saith the Lord, &amp; they shall afflict you <a id="l2940"></a>from the entring in of Hamath unto the river of the wilder<a id="l2941"></a>ness</em>. God here threatens to raise up a nation against Israel <a id="l2942"></a>but what nation he names not. That he conceales till the <a id="l2943"></a>Assyrians should appear &amp; discover it. In the prophesies of <a id="l2944"></a>Isaiah, Ieremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Micah, Nahum, Zephany, <a id="l2945"></a>&amp; Zechary, which were written after this Monarchy grew <a id="l2946"></a>up, its openly named upon all occasions; but in this of <a id="l2947"></a>Amos not once, tho the captivity of Syria &amp; Israel be often <a id="l2948"></a>threatned. He only saith in general that  Syria should <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p064r"> &lt;64r&gt; </span> go into captivity unto Kir, &amp; that Israel notwithstanding <a id="l2949"></a>her present greatness should go into captivity beyond Da<a id="l2950"></a>mascus, &amp; that God would raise up a nation to afflict them <a id="l2951"></a>meaning that he would raise up above them from a lower <a id="l2952"></a>condition, a nation whom they yet feared not. For so the <a id="l2953"></a>Hebrew word םקמ signifies when applied to men, as in Amos <a id="l2954"></a>V.2. 1 Sam. XII.11. Psal. CXIII.7. Ier. X.20 &amp; L.32. Hab. I.6. Zech. <a id="l2955"></a>XI.16. Amos mentions the Assyrians but once, &amp; it is only <a id="l2956"></a>to tell us that they had been in captivity. Have not I <a id="l2957"></a>brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, &amp; the Phi<a id="l2958"></a>listims from Caphtor, &amp; the Assyrians from Kir? Amos <a id="l2959"></a>IX.7. They were therefore returned from captivity, <a id="l2960"></a>&amp; at the writing of this prophesy made no great figure <a id="l2961"></a>in the world, but were to be raised up against Israel <a id="l2962"></a>&amp; by consequence rose in the days of Pul &amp; his successors <a id="l2963"></a>For after Ieroboam had conquered Damascus &amp; Hamath, his <a id="l2964"></a>successor Menahem destroyed Tipsah with its territories <a id="l2965"></a>upon Euphrates because in his expedition against Shallum <a id="l2966"></a> who usurped the crown they opened not to <a id="l2967"></a>him. And therefore Israel continued in its greatness till Pul <a id="l2968"></a>(probably grown formidable by some victories) caused Menahem <a id="l2969"></a>to buy his peace. Pul therefore reigning presently after <a id="l2970"></a>the prophesy of Amos, &amp; being the first upon record who <a id="l2971"></a>began to fulfill it, may be justly recconed the first con<a id="l2972"></a>queror &amp; founder of this empire. For God stirred up the <a id="l2973"></a>spirit of Pul king of Assyria &amp; the spirit of Tiglathpileser <a id="l2974"></a>king of Assyria, 1 Chron. V.26.</p>
<p id="par134">I have hitherto taken a view of the times reputed fabulous <a id="l2975"></a>by the Greeks &amp; Latines, &amp; shewed that before the reign of <a id="l2976"></a>Pul &amp; the beginning of the Olympiads there were no great <a id="l2977"></a>Empires in the world on this side of India except that of Egypt founded by Ammon <a id="l2978"></a>&amp; Sesak, which was but of short continuance. Towns began to <a id="l2979"></a>be built in Europe not above an hundred &amp; eighty years before <a id="l2980"></a>the Argonautic expedition, &amp; the founder of every town was <a id="l2981"></a>its first king. The first city that reigned over all Italy was <a id="l2982"></a>Rome, &amp; the first that reigned over all Greece was Macedon. <a id="l2983"></a>Media before the days of Dejoces was peopled by villages &amp; <a id="l2984"></a>Ecbatane was the first city of the Medes which reigned over <a id="l2985"></a>all the rest as Herodotus relates. Nineveh was the first <a id="l2986"></a>capital city of all Assyria, Babylon the first of all Chaldea, <a id="l2987"></a>Thebes the first of all Egypt &amp; Ierusalem the first of all <a id="l2988"></a>Phœnicia between Egypt &amp; Euphrates.  The earth  in those days was overspread with woods which have been since cut down by degrees to make room for mankind. Phœnicia &amp; the regions <a id="l2989"></a>upon Tigris were but thinly peopled in the days of the Pa<a id="l2990"></a>triarchs. Four kings from the coasts of Shinar &amp; Elam invaded <a id="l2991"></a>&amp; spoiled the Rephaims, &amp; the inhabitants of the countries of <a id="l2992"></a>Moab Ammon Edom &amp; Amalek &amp; the Amorites &amp; kings <a id="l2993"></a>of Sodom Gomorrha Admah &amp; Zeboim, &amp; yet were pursued <a id="l2994"></a>&amp; beaten by Abraham &amp; three other kings of Canaan with <a id="l2995"></a>an armed force of only 318 men. The Patriarchs fed <a id="l2996"></a>their flocks wherever they pleased, the fields of Syria &amp; <a id="l2997"></a>Palestine being not yet appropriated. And Egypt was so thinly <a id="l2998"></a>peopled that Pharaoh said of the Israelites: <em class="underline">Behold the people <a id="l2999"></a>of the children of Israel are more &amp; mightier then we</em>; &amp; to <a id="l3000"></a>prevent their multiplying, caused their male children to be <a id="l3001"></a>drowned. The chariots of iron of all Egypt in the days of Moses <a id="l3002"></a>were but six hundred, &amp; the chariots of Iabin king of Hazor <a id="l3003"></a>in the land of Canaan in the days of Deborah &amp; Barak were         
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p065r"> &lt;65r&gt; </span> nine hundred. The Canaanites spread &amp; gave new names to <a id="l3004"></a>places &amp; built new cities all the days of the Patriarchs &amp; <a id="l3005"></a>the cities continued each under its own king till the days of <a id="l3006"></a>Ioshua, &amp; the Canaanites that fled from Ioshua conquered <a id="l3007"></a>Egypt. And while the world was but thinly peopled, &amp; king<a id="l3008"></a>doms were small &amp; numerous &amp; uncivilized, &amp; letters were not yet in use <a id="l3009"></a>an exact account of particular kingdoms is not to be ex<a id="l3010"></a>pected for want of sufficient records. It may suffice to <a id="l3011"></a>have shewed in general that the antiquities of the <a id="l3012"></a>Egyptians, Syrians, Assyrians, Chaldæans, Persians &amp; Greeks <a id="l3013"></a>are made too  ancient by the heathens, &amp; to have <a id="l3014"></a>given an Idea of the dark ages more consistent with <a id="l3015"></a>the course of nature &amp; more consonant to the scriptures <a id="l3016"></a>which are by far the oldest records now extant. And <a id="l3017"></a>having brought down this general account of the <a id="l3018"></a>times to the beginning of the Olympiads &amp; Æra of <a id="l3019"></a>Nabonasser without undertaking to be exact in the <a id="l3020"></a>histories of particular kingdoms, it remains  <a id="l3021"></a>that I proceed now to consider the great empires <a id="l3022"></a>which have risen since the end of the fabulous <a id="l3023"></a>ages, beginning with   the Assyrian Empire which arose about the <a id="l3025"></a>same time that the Olympiads began.</p>

And the three last <a id="l3056"></a>kings of the second Dynasty they call Ardschir Diraz, <a id="l3057"></a>Darab his bastard son &amp; Darab who was conquered by <a id="l3058"></a>Ascander Roumi, that is Artaxerxes Longimanus, Darius <a id="l3059"></a>Nothus &amp; Darius who was conquered by Alexander the Greek. <a id="l3060"></a>They omit the kings between these two Darius's, which shews <a id="l3061"></a>that their history of this kingdom is imperfect: but by <a id="l3062"></a>the names of the kings here mentioned, tis certain that by <a id="l3063"></a>the second Dynasty they mean that of the kings of Media <a id="l3064"></a>&amp; Persia mentioned in scripture: &amp; by consequence by <a id="l3065"></a>the first Dynasty they mean  <a id="l3066"></a>either the kings of the Assyrian empire or others who <a id="l3067"></a>reigned in Persia eastward of Assyria. </p>
<p id="par137">The Saracen historians who write of the Persian <a id="l3070"></a>antiquities call Ardschir Diraz also by the name of <a id="l3071"></a>Bahaman, &amp; ascribe to Bahaman the actions of Darius <a id="l3072"></a>Medus &amp; Darius Hystaspis, taking perhaps Diraz &amp; <a id="l3073"></a>Darius for one &amp; the same name. For they say that <a id="l3074"></a>Bahaman went westward into Mesopotamia &amp; Syria &amp; <a id="l3075"></a>conquered Balthasar the son of Nebuchadnezzar, &amp; gave <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p067r"> &lt;67r&gt; </span> the kingdom of Babylon to Cyrus his Lieutenant general over <a id="l3076"></a>Media Assyria &amp; Chaldea: &amp; here they take Bahaman <a id="l3077"></a>for Darius Medus. They say also that Bahaman was the <a id="l3078"></a>grandson of Kischtasp or Hystaspes &amp; that Kischtasp was <a id="l3079"></a>contemporary to Zaradust or Zoroaster the legislator of <a id="l3080"></a>the Ghebers or fire-worshippers, &amp; established his doctrines <a id="l3081"></a>throughout all Persia, &amp; that the father of this Bahaman <a id="l3082"></a>was not a king: &amp; here they take Bahaman for Darius <a id="l3083"></a>Hystaspis. And this confusion of persons makes it further <a id="l3084"></a>appear that the oriental histories of those ancient  <a id="l3085"></a>kingdoms are very imperfect &amp; uncertain.</p>
<p id="par138">And the same is further confirmed by the long reigns <a id="l3086"></a>which the Oriental historians ascribe to the kings of those <a id="l3087"></a>two Dynasties. For they tell us that some of the Pisch<a id="l3088"></a>dadian kings lived a thousand years a piece &amp; that they <a id="l3089"></a> reigned all together above three thousand years. <a id="l3090"></a>And to the first king of the second Dynasty they assigne <a id="l3091"></a>a reign of 120 years, to the second a reign of 150 years <a id="l3092"></a>to the third a reign of 60 years, to the fourth a reign <a id="l3093"></a>of 120 years, to the fifth as much, &amp; to the sixt called <a id="l3094"></a>Artaxerxes Longimanus a reign of 112 years. So then <a id="l3095"></a>we need not wonder that the Egyptians have made the kings <a id="l3096"></a>in the first Dynasty of their Monarchy (that which was seated <a id="l3097"></a>at Thebes in the days of David &amp; Solomon) so very ancient <a id="l3098"></a>&amp; so long lived since the Persians have done the like to <a id="l3099"></a>the kings who reigned in Persia above 200 years after <a id="l3100"></a>the days of Solomon.</p>
<p id="par139">The oriental historians say that the fourth king of <a id="l3101"></a>their second Dynasty, whom they call Lohorasp, was the <a id="l3102"></a>father of Kischlasp &amp; the grandfather of Cyrus &amp; the great <a id="l3103"></a>grandfather of  that Bahaman above mentioned who was the grandson of <a id="l3104"></a>Kischtasp, that is, of Darius Hystaspis; &amp; by these recconings <a id="l3105"></a>they make Lohorasp as old as Cyaxeres. They say also <a id="l3106"></a>that Lohorasp was the first of their kings who reduced <a id="l3107"></a>their armies to good order &amp; discipline, &amp; Herodotus affirms <a id="l3108"></a>the same thing of Cyaxeres. And they say further that <a id="l3109"></a>Lohorasp went eastward &amp; conquered many Provinces of <a id="l3110"></a>Persia, &amp; that one of his Generals whom the Hebrews call Nebu<a id="l3111"></a>chadnezzar &amp; other call Raham &amp; Gudarz went westward &amp; <a id="l3112"></a>conquered all Syria &amp;Iudea, &amp; took the city Ierusalem &amp; destroyed <a id="l3113"></a>it. And by these circumstances they take Lohorasp for one &amp; <a id="l3114"></a>the same king with Cyaxeres, calling Nebuchadnezzar his Ge<a id="l3115"></a>neral because he assisted him in the taking of Nineveh [before <a id="l3116"></a>they seperated from one another &amp; went, the one eastward <a id="l3117"></a>against the provinces of Persia, &amp; the other westward against <a id="l3118"></a>Syria &amp; Phœnicia]. Seing therefore that Lohorasp was the fourth <a id="l3119"></a>king of the second Dynasty of the Persians, this Dynasty began <a id="l3120"></a>about three reigns or sixty years before the fall of Nineveh, <a id="l3121"></a>&amp; by consequence at that time when the Medes &amp; other <a id="l3122"></a>nations  revolted from the Assyrians.</p>
<p id="par140">The oriental historians tell us also that in those days <a id="l3123"></a>the Scythians of Touran or Turquestan on the north side of the <a id="l3124"></a>river Oxus which runs westward into the Caspian sea, having <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p068r"> &lt;68r&gt; </span> erectec there a potent kingdom called the kingdom of Touran or <a id="l3125"></a>Turquestan, , invaded Perisa frequently <a id="l3127"></a>under their king Afrasiab, &amp; that in the reign of the eighth <a id="l3128"></a>king of the Pischdadians, Afrasiab conquered Persia &amp; reigned <a id="l3129"></a>over it twelve years together &amp; then was repulsed by the <a id="l3130"></a>tenth king of the Pischdadians, &amp; invaded it again in the reign <a id="l3131"></a>of the eleventh &amp; last king of the Pischdadians whom they called Kischtasp, &amp; was at <a id="l3132"></a>lenght slain in the mountains of Media by the third king <a id="l3133"></a>of the second Dynasty. If for reducing the reign of <a id="l3134"></a>Afriasab to such a lenght as exceeds not the course of <a id="l3135"></a>nature, we may suppose that the Scythians under Afrasiab <a id="l3136"></a>by their first invasion of Persia gave occasion to that <a id="l3137"></a>revolt of the Medes &amp; other nations from the Assyrians <a id="l3138"></a>which is mentioned by Herodotus; there will be but seven <a id="l3139"></a>kings of the Pischdadians before the reign of Afrasiab &amp; the <a id="l3140"></a>revolt of the Medes, &amp; three more of the Caianides before <a id="l3141"></a>the reign of Lohorasp or Cyaneres. And these ten reigns <a id="l3142"></a>being recconed at about 18 or 20 years a piece will place <a id="l3143"></a>the beginning of the Dynasty of the Pischdadians about <a id="l3144"></a>180 or 200 years before the taking of Nineveh by Cyax<a id="l3145"></a>eres &amp; Nebuchadnezzar. So then the Persians have no <a id="l3146"></a>memory of any thing do<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>n<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>e  in Persia above 200 years <a id="l3147"></a>before the reign of Nebuchadnezzar; &amp; their history of the <a id="l3148"></a>two first Dynasties of their kings is very dark &amp; full of <a id="l3149"></a>uncertainties.</p>
<p id="par141">I have hitherto taken a view of the times reputed <a id="l3150"></a>fabulous by the Greeks &amp; Latines, &amp; shewed that before <a id="l3151"></a>the reign of Pul &amp; the beginning of the Olympiads there <a id="l3152"></a>were no great Empires in the world (on this side of India) <a id="l3153"></a>except that of Egypt founded by Ammon &amp; Sesak, which <a id="l3154"></a>was but of short continuance. Towns began to be built in <a id="l3155"></a>Europe not above two hundred years before the Argonautic expe<a id="l3156"></a>dition; And the first houses were rude &amp; small, there being no <a id="l3157"></a>iron tools &amp; by consequence no Carpenters nor artificers in all <a id="l3158"></a>Europe before the days of Minos king of Crete who was <a id="l3159"></a>contemporary to Solomon: &amp; the first towns were small <a id="l3160"></a>unwalled villages. Troy was not walled before the days of <a id="l3161"></a>Lamedon the father of Priam. Thebes was not walled before <a id="l3162"></a>the reign of Amphion &amp; Zethus who were contemporary <a id="l3163"></a>to La<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ios<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the great grandson of Cadmus. And it will be <a id="l3164"></a>difficult to name a town in all Europe which was walled <a id="l3165"></a>before the death of Solomon. The founder of every town <a id="l3166"></a>was its first king, &amp; the town which gained dominion over <a id="l3167"></a>other towns &amp; set up a form of government became a <a id="l3168"></a>city, &amp; the first city which reigned over all Italy was Rome <a id="l3169"></a>&amp; the first which reigned over all Greece was Macedon. Media <a id="l3170"></a>before the days of Dejoces was peopled by villages &amp; Ecbatane <a id="l3171"></a>was the first city of the Medes which reigned over all the <a id="l3172"></a>rest as Herodotus relates. Nineveh was the first capital <a id="l3173"></a>city of all Assyria, Babylon the first of all Chaldea, <a id="l3174"></a>Thebes the first of all Egypt, &amp; Ierusalem the first of <a id="l3175"></a>all Phœnicia between Egypt &amp; Euphrates. Numa was the <a id="l3176"></a>first lawgiver of the Romans, Zeleuces of the Locri, Draco <a id="l3177"></a>of the Athenians, Lycurgus of the Spartans, Phoroneus of <a id="l3178"></a>the Argives, Minos of the Cretans, Ammon &amp; Sesac of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p069r"> &lt;69r&gt; </span>  from a rambling vagabond <a id="l3179"></a>salvage way of life to love together in towns &amp; cultivate arts &amp; im<a id="l3180"></a>ployments convenient for life. The first ships were small round <a id="l3181"></a>vessels of burden with oars for going over lakes &amp; between the <a id="l3182"></a>islands of that shallow sea which lies between Egypt &amp; Arabia <a id="l3183"></a>&amp; the first long &amp; tall ships with sails were built by Ammon &amp; Sesac in the days of  David &amp; Solomon, &amp; the ship <a id="l3184"></a>Argo which was the first long ship built by the Greeks, was <a id="l3185"></a>built 40 years after the death of Solomon in imitation of <a id="l3186"></a>a ship which Danaus brought from Egypt. The earth <a id="l3187"></a>in those early ages was overspread with wood &amp; infested <a id="l3188"></a>with wild beasts, &amp; the first men lived in fertil planes well <a id="l3189"></a>watered with rivers such as were those upon Tigris &amp; the <a id="l3190"></a>Nile where kingdomes &amp; civility began. And the beasts have <a id="l3191"></a>been since destroyed &amp; the woods cut down to make room for <a id="l3192"></a>mankind. Many islands of the Mediterranean covered with <a id="l3193"></a>woods &amp; inhabited only by Serpents &amp; wild beasts have been peopled <a id="l3194"></a>by Phorbas Æolus Rhadamanthus &amp; others since the coming of Cecrops  &amp; Lelex with colonies from Egypt. <a id="l3195"></a>The island Cyprus when first discovered by the Phœnicians was <a id="l3196"></a>covered all over with wood, &amp; the Hercynian wood now cut down <a id="l3197"></a>covered a great part of Europe even till the days of the <a id="l3198"></a>Roman Empire. Phœnicia &amp; the regions upon the Tigris were but <a id="l3199"></a>thinly peopled in the days of the Patriarchs. Four kings from the <a id="l3200"></a>coasts of Shinar &amp; Elam invaded &amp; spoiled the Rephaims, &amp; the <a id="l3201"></a>inhabitants of the countries of Moab Ammon Edom &amp; Amalek &amp; <a id="l3202"></a> &amp; the kings of Sodom Gomorrha Admah &amp; Zeboim,  &amp; <a id="l3203"></a>yet were pursued &amp; beaten by Abraham &amp; three other kings <a id="l3204"></a>of Canaan with an armed force of only 318 men. The <a id="l3205"></a>Patriarchs fed their flocks wherever they pleased, the fields <a id="l3206"></a>of Syria &amp; Palestine being not yet appropriated. And Egypt <a id="l3207"></a>was so thinly peopled that Pharaoh said of the Israelites <a id="l3208"></a><em class="underline">Behold the people of the children of Israel are more &amp; mightier <a id="l3209"></a>then We</em>; &amp; to prevent their multiplying, caused their male <a id="l3210"></a>children to be drowned. The chariots of iron of all Egypt <a id="l3211"></a>in the days of Moses were but six hundred, &amp; the chariots <a id="l3212"></a>of Iabin king of Hazor in the land of Canaan in the days <a id="l3213"></a>of Deborah &amp; Barak were nine hundred. The Canaanites <a id="l3214"></a>spread &amp; gave new names to places &amp; built new cities all the days <a id="l3215"></a>of the Patriarchs, &amp; the cities continued each under its own king <a id="l3216"></a>till the days of Ioshua, &amp; the Canaanites who fled from Ioshua <a id="l3217"></a>conquered Egypt, &amp; Arabia Petræa &amp; Nabatæa as well as Phenicia <a id="l3218"></a>have been peopled by the seed of Abraham besided the nations sprung <a id="l3219"></a>from Keturah whom Abraham sent eastward. And the remoter re<a id="l3220"></a>gions were peopled &amp; civilized still later. Corn was not known in Europe <a id="l3221"></a>before the days of David. Diodorus tells us that the Libyans had a <a id="l3222"></a>tradition that Vranus the father of Hyperion &amp; grandfather of <a id="l3223"></a>Helius &amp; Selene, that is Ammon the father of Sesak was their <a id="l3224"></a>first king &amp; caused the people who then wandered up &amp; down to dwell <a id="l3225"></a>in towns &amp; cities, &amp; reducing them from a lawless &amp; salvage course of life taught them to use &amp; lay up the fruits of the earth &amp; do many <a id="l3226"></a>other things useful for mans life. Thucydides lets us know that the Greeks <a id="l3227"></a>were wanderers till the times of the Trojan war. The Germans were <a id="l3228"></a>wanderers till the times of the Roman Empire, &amp; a great part of the <a id="l3229"></a>Tartars &amp; West Indians are wanderers to this day.</p>

<p id="par142">✝The Empire of China is reputed very ancient, &amp; yet rose up out of <a id="l3230"></a>many small kingdoms about the same time with the western Empires as I <a id="l3231"></a> find related in the Chronological Table of the Monarchy of China printed <a id="l3232"></a>at Paris  at the end of the Book of Confucius called Scientia <a id="l3233"></a>Sinensis. For in this Table China is represented divided into many kingdoms <a id="l3234"></a> four or five hundred years before the birth of Christ some of which kingdoms had lasted six <a id="l3235"></a>or seven hundred years. . And 1600 years before <a id="l3236"></a>the birth of Christ there were at least seventy &amp; six kingdoms in <a id="l3237"></a>China which sent Deputies to a Common Council. And 1776 years before <a id="l3238"></a>Christ, one of their kings was moved by eight hundred Potentates in China <a id="l3239"></a> to make war upon another of their kings. And these <a id="l3240"></a>Potentates or Kings which at first were so numerous, continued warring <a id="l3241"></a>with one another &amp; conquering one another till at length they were <a id="l3242"></a>reduced into seven great kingdoms, &amp; then <em class="underline">Xi Hoam ti</em> the king of one <a id="l3243"></a>of those kingdoms conquered the other six &amp; founded the Monarchy <a id="l3244"></a>of China &amp; divided it into 36 Provinces; &amp; this was about 220 years <a id="l3245"></a>before the birth of Christ. The same King gave the name of <em class="underline">Hoam ti</em> <a id="l3246"></a>to the succeeding Kings of this Monarchy, a name which remains to <a id="l3247"></a>this day, &amp; built the great wall of China against the Tartarsm &amp; <a id="l3248"></a>commanded his people upon pain of death, to burn all the books in <a id="l3249"></a>China except those which related to medicine or were judicial. And <a id="l3250"></a>therefore the story that Hoam ti founded the Monarchy of China 2697 years <a id="l3251"></a>before  the birth of Christ is a fable invented to make that Monarchy <a id="l3252"></a>look ancient. The histories now extant in China were composed above 72 years <a id="l3253"></a>after the burning of the books, &amp; if any escaped the flames they related to particu<a id="l3254"></a>lar kingdoms. The historical books now most in repute in China are void of <a id="l3255"></a>Chronology, &amp; the reigns of their first kings are made too long for the course <a id="l3256"></a>of nature. Let their Monarchy be founded but once  by Hoam ti &amp; it will not be above <a id="l3257"></a>246 years older then the birth of Christ. And Fo hi who  is said to have reduced <a id="l3258"></a>the  eastern people of China from a barbarous &amp; bruitish <a id="l3259"></a>way of life &amp; taught them humanity, will not perhaps be above  six or eight hundred <a id="l3260"></a>years older. And if a greater antiquity be contended for, it ought to be upon better authority then that of Books written since the rise of the Roman Empire.<a id="l3261"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now while – –</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 69r resumes &gt; </span>
