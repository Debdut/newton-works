<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">Sect 1 <a id="l5"></a><br>Of the prophetic language.</h2>
<p id="par1">For understanding these descriptions we are in the <a id="l6"></a>first place to acquaint our selves with the figurative <a id="l7"></a>language of the Prophets. And this language is taken from <a id="l8"></a>the analogy between the world natural &amp; an Empire or King<a id="l9"></a>dom considered as a world politique.</p>
<p id="par2">Accordingly the whole world natural consisting of heaven <a id="l10"></a>&amp; earth signifies the whole world politique consisting of thrones <a id="l11"></a>&amp; people, or so much of it as is considered in the prophesy: &amp; <a id="l12"></a>the things in that world signify the analogous things in this. For <a id="l13"></a>the heavens &amp; the things therein signify thrones &amp; dignities <a id="l14"></a>&amp; those that enjoy them; &amp; the earth with the things therein the <a id="l15"></a>inferior people, &amp; the lowest parts of the earth called Hades <a id="l16"></a>or Hell the lowest or most miserable part of the people. Whence <a id="l17"></a>ascending towards heaven &amp; descending to the earth are put for <a id="l18"></a>rising &amp; falling in honour &amp; power. Rising out of the earth <a id="l19"></a>or waters &amp; falling into them for the rising up to any dignity <a id="l20"></a>or dominion out of the inferior state of the people, or falling <a id="l21"></a>down from the same  into that inferior state. Descending <a id="l22"></a>into the lower parts of the earth for descending to a very low &amp; <a id="l23"></a>unhappy estate. Speaking with a faint voice out of the dust for <a id="l24"></a>being in a weak &amp; low condition. Moving from one place to another <a id="l25"></a>for translation from one office dignity or dominion to another. <a id="l26"></a>Great earthquakes &amp; the shaking of heaven &amp; earth for the <a id="l27"></a>shaking of kingdoms so as to distract or overthrow them. The <a id="l28"></a>creating a new heaven &amp; earth &amp; the passing away of an old one, or the <a id="l29"></a>beginning &amp; end of the world, for the rise &amp; ruin of the body <a id="l30"></a>politique signified thereby.</p>
<p id="par3">In the heavens the Sun &amp; Moon  are by inter<a id="l31"></a>preters of dreams put for the persons of Kings &amp; Queens, but in <a id="l32"></a>sacred prophesy which regards not single persons, the sun is put <a id="l33"></a>for the whole species &amp; race of kings in the kingdom or kingdoms <a id="l34"></a>of the world polytick shining with regal power &amp; glory: the Moon <a id="l35"></a>for the body of the common people considered as the kings wife: the <a id="l36"></a>starrs for subordinate Princes &amp; great men, or for Bishops &amp; <a id="l37"></a>Rulers of the people of God when the Sun is Christ. Light for the <a id="l38"></a>glory truth &amp; knowledge wherewith great &amp; good men shine &amp; illu<a id="l39"></a>minate others. Darkness for obscurity of condition, &amp; for error <a id="l40"></a>blindness &amp; ignorance. Darkning, smiting, or setting of the Sun <a id="l41"></a>Moon &amp; starrs for the ceasing of a kingdom, or for the desolation <a id="l42"></a>thereof proportional to the darkness. Darkning the Sun, turning <a id="l43"></a>the Moon into blood &amp; falling of the starrs, for the same. New <a id="l44"></a>Moons for the return of a dispersed people into a body politique <a id="l45"></a>or ecclesiastick.</p>

<p id="par4">Fire &amp; Meteors refer to both heaven &amp; earth &amp; signify <a id="l46"></a>as follows. Burning any thing by fire is put for the <em class="underline">consumption</em> <sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> <a id="l47"></a>thereof by war. A conflagration of the earth or turning a country <a id="l48"></a>into a Lake of fire, for the consumption of a kingdom by war. The being in a furnace for the being in slavery under another <a id="l49"></a>nation. The ascending up of the smoak of any burning thing <a id="l50"></a>for ever &amp; ever for the continuation of a conquered people <a id="l51"></a>under the misery of perpetual subjection &amp; slavery. The scorch<a id="l52"></a>ing heat of the Sun for vexatious warrs persecutions &amp; troubles <a id="l53"></a>inflicted by the king. Clouds whether in heaven or on earth for <a id="l54"></a>multitudes of men. Riding on the clouds for reigning over much <a id="l55"></a>people. Covering the Sun with a cloud or with smoak, for op<a id="l56"></a>pression of the king by the armies of an enemy. Tempestuous <a id="l57"></a>winds (that is the motion of clouds) for warrs. Thunder (that <a id="l58"></a>is, the voice of a cloud) for the voice of a multitude. A storm <a id="l59"></a>of thunder lightning hail &amp; overflowing rain for a tempest <a id="l60"></a>of war descending from the heavens &amp; clouds politique on the <a id="l61"></a>heads of their enemies. Rain if not immoderate, &amp; dew, &amp; <a id="l62"></a>living water, for the graces &amp; doctrines of the spirit. And the <a id="l63"></a>defect of rain for spiritual barrenness.</p>
<p id="par5">In the earth the dry land &amp; congregated waters (as <a id="l64"></a>a Sea, a River, a Flood) are put for the peoples of several <a id="l65"></a>regions nations &amp; dominions. Embittering of waters for great <a id="l66"></a>affliction of the people by war &amp; persecution. Turning them to <a id="l67"></a>blood for the mystical death of bodies politique, that is, for <a id="l68"></a>their dissolution. The overflowing of a sea or river for the <a id="l69"></a>invasion of the earth politique by the people of the waters. <a id="l70"></a>Drying up of waters for the conquest of their regions by the <a id="l71"></a>earth. Fountains of waters for cities the permanent heads <a id="l72"></a>of rivers politique. Mountains &amp; Islands for the cities of the <a id="l73"></a>earth &amp; sea politique with the territories &amp; dominions belong<a id="l74"></a>ing to those cities. Dens &amp; Rocks of mountains for the Temples <a id="l75"></a>of cities. The hiding of men in those Dens &amp; Rocks for the <a id="l76"></a>shutting up of  Idols in their Temples. Houses &amp; Ships, for <a id="l77"></a>families assemblies &amp; towns in the earth &amp; sea politique. And <a id="l78"></a>a navy of war-ships for an army of the kingdom signified <a id="l79"></a>by the sea.</p>
<p id="par6">Also animals &amp; vegetables are put for people of several <a id="l80"></a>regions &amp; conditions, &amp; particularly Trees hearbs &amp; land animals <a id="l81"></a>for the people of the earth politique. Flaggs Reeds &amp; Fishes for <a id="l82"></a>those of the waters politique. And Birds &amp; Insects for those of the <a id="l83"></a>politique heaven &amp; earth. A forest for a kingdom. Paradise for <a id="l84"></a>a flourishing &amp; peaceable kingdom. And a wilderness for a desolate <a id="l85"></a>&amp; thin people.</p>
<p id="par7">If the world politique consisted in prophesy consists of <a id="l86"></a>many kingdoms, they are represented by as many parts of the world <a id="l87"></a>naturall. As the noblest by the celestial frame; &amp; then the <a id="l88"></a>Moon &amp; clouds are put for the common people. The less noble by <a id="l89"></a>the earth sea &amp; rivers, &amp; by the animals or vegetables or <a id="l90"></a>buildings therein; &amp; then the greater &amp; more powerfull animals <a id="l91"></a>&amp; taller trees are put for Kings Princes &amp; Nobles. And because <a id="l92"></a>the whole kingdom is the body politique of the king, therefore <a id="l93"></a>the Sun, or a Tree, or a Beast or Bird or a Man whereby the <a id="l94"></a>King is represented, is put in a large signification for the <a id="l95"></a>whole kingdom; &amp; several animals, as Lion, a Beare, a Leo<a id="l96"></a>pard a Goat, according to their qualities, are put for several <a id="l97"></a>kingdoms &amp; bodies politique; &amp; sacrificing of Beasts for slaughter<a id="l98"></a>ing &amp; conquering of kingdoms; &amp; friendship between Beasts for <a id="l99"></a>peace between kingdoms. Yet sometimes Vegetables &amp; Animals <a id="l100"></a>are by certain epithites or circumstances extended to other <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> significations; as a Tree when called the tree of life or of <a id="l101"></a>knowledge, &amp; a Beast when called the Old Serpent or wor<a id="l102"></a>shipped.</p>
<p id="par8">When a Beast or Man is put for a kingdom his  parts &amp; qualities are put for the analogous parts &amp; <a id="l104"></a>qualities of the kingdom. As the head of a Beast for the great <a id="l105"></a>men who precede &amp; govern. The Tail for the inferior people <a id="l106"></a>who follow &amp; are governed. The heads if more then one for <a id="l107"></a>the number of capital parts dynasties or dominions in the <a id="l108"></a>kingdom whether collateral or successive with respect to <a id="l109"></a>the civil government. The horns on any head for the <a id="l110"></a>number of kingdoms in that head with respect to military <a id="l111"></a>power. Seeing for understanding, &amp; the eyes for men of <a id="l112"></a>understanding &amp; policy &amp; in matters of  religion <a id="l113"></a>for Ε᾽πισκοποι Bishops. Speaking for making laws. The <a id="l114"></a>mouth for a lawgiver whether civil or sacred. The loudness <a id="l115"></a>of the voice for might &amp; power. The faintness thereof for <a id="l116"></a>weakness. Eating &amp; drinking for acquiring what is signified <a id="l117"></a>by the things eaten &amp; drunken. The hairs of a Beast or Man <a id="l118"></a>&amp; the feathers of a Bird for people. The wings for the branches <a id="l119"></a>of a people spread abroad by conquest over other nations. The <a id="l120"></a>arm of a man for his power or for any people wherein his <a id="l121"></a>strength &amp; power consists. His feet for the lowest of the <a id="l122"></a>people, or for the latter end of the kingdom. The feet nails <a id="l123"></a>&amp; teeth of a Beast of prey for armies &amp; squadrons of armies. <a id="l124"></a>The bones for strength &amp; fortified places. The flesh for riches <a id="l125"></a>&amp; possessions. And the days of their continuing or acting for <a id="l126"></a>years. And when a tree is put for a kingdom, its branches <a id="l127"></a>leaves &amp; fruit signify as do the wings feathers &amp; food of a <a id="l128"></a>Bird or Beast.</p>
<p id="par9">When a Man is taken in a mystical sense his qualities <a id="l129"></a>are often signified by his actions &amp; by the circumstances of <a id="l130"></a>things about him. So a Ruler is signified by his riding on a Beast. <a id="l131"></a>A Warrior &amp; Conqueror by his having a sword &amp; bow. A potent <a id="l132"></a>man by his gigantic stature. A Iudge by weights &amp; measures. <a id="l133"></a>A sentence of absolution or condemnation by a white or black <a id="l134"></a>stone. A new dignity by a new name. Moral or civil qualifi<a id="l135"></a>cations by garments. Honour &amp; glory by splendid apparel. <a id="l136"></a>Royal dignity by purple or scarlet or by a crown. Righteousness <a id="l137"></a>by white &amp; clean robes. Wickedness by spotted &amp; filthy garments. <a id="l138"></a>Affliction, mourning &amp; humiliation by cloathing in sackcloth. <a id="l139"></a>Dishonour shame &amp; want of good works by nakedness. Error <a id="l140"></a>&amp; misery by drinking a cup of his or her wine who causeth <a id="l141"></a>it. Propagating any religion for gain by exercising trafick <a id="l142"></a>&amp; merchandise with that people whose religion it is. Wor<a id="l143"></a>shipping or serving the fals Gods of any nation by committing <a id="l144"></a>adultery with their Princes or by worshipping them &amp; their <a id="l145"></a>image &amp; blaspheming God; or by receiving their mark or <a id="l146"></a>name or the number thereof in the hand or forehead in <a id="l147"></a>token of servitude. Overthrow in war by a wound of man <a id="l148"></a>or beast. A durable plague of war by a sore or pain. The <a id="l149"></a>affliction or persecution which a people suffers in labouring to bring <a id="l150"></a>forth a new kingdom by pain in travel of a manchild. The <a id="l151"></a>birth of a new kingdom by the birth of a Manchild. The dissolution <a id="l152"></a>of a body politick or ecclesiastick by the death or man or beast <a id="l153"></a>&amp; the revival of a dissolved dominion by the resurrection of the dead.</p></div>

For <a id="l163"></a>the heavens with the things therein signify thrones &amp; dignities <a id="l164"></a>&amp; those that enjoy them, &amp; the earth with the things therein <a id="l165"></a>the inferiour people, &amp; the lowest parts of the earth called <a id="l166"></a>Hades or Hell the lowest or most miserable part of the people. <a id="l167"></a>Whence ascending towards heaven &amp; descending to the earth <a id="l168"></a>are put for rising &amp; falling in honour &amp; power. Rising out <a id="l169"></a>of the earth or waters &amp; falling into them, for the rising up <a id="l170"></a>to any dominion or dignity out of the inferior state of the <a id="l171"></a>people, or falling down from the same into  that inferior <a id="l172"></a>state. Descending into the lower parts of the earth called <a id="l173"></a>Hades or Hell, for descending to a very low &amp; unhappy state. <a id="l174"></a>Speaking with a faint voice out of the dust for being in a <a id="l175"></a>weak &amp; low condition. Moving from one place to another <a id="l176"></a>for translation from one office dignity or dominion to another. <a id="l177"></a>Great earthquakes &amp; the shaking of heaven &amp; earth, for <a id="l178"></a>the shaking of kingdoms so as to imbroile or overthrow them. The <a id="l179"></a>creating a new heaven &amp; earth &amp; their passing away, or which is <a id="l180"></a> all one, the beginning &amp; end of the world, for the rise &amp; ruin <a id="l181"></a>of the body politique signified thereby.</p>
<p id="par12">In the heavens, the Sun &amp; Moon are by interpreters of <a id="l182"></a>dreams put for the persons of Kings &amp; Queens, but in sacred <a id="l183"></a>Prophesy which regards not single persons, the Sun is put for <a id="l184"></a>the whole species &amp; race of kings in the kingdom or kingdoms <a id="l185"></a>of the world polytick shining with regal power &amp; glory: the Moon <a id="l186"></a>for the body of the common people considered as the Kings wife: <a id="l187"></a>the starrs for subordinate Princes &amp; great men, or for Bishops &amp; <a id="l188"></a>Rulers of the people of God when the Sun is Christ. Light for <a id="l189"></a>the glory truth &amp; knowledge wherewith great &amp; good men shine <a id="l190"></a>&amp; illuminate others. Darkness for obscurity of condition &amp; for <a id="l191"></a>error blindness &amp; ignorance. Darkning smiting or setting of the <a id="l192"></a>Sun Moon &amp; starrs, for the ceasing of a kingdom, or for the <a id="l193"></a>desolation thereof proportional to the darkness . Darkning <a id="l194"></a>the Sun, turning the Moon into blood &amp; falling of the starrs, <a id="l195"></a>for the same. New Moons for the return of a dispersed people <a id="l196"></a>into a body politique or ecclesiastick.</p>
<p id="par13">Fire &amp; Meteors refer to both heaven &amp; earth &amp; signify <a id="l197"></a>as follows. Burning any thing by fire is put for the con<a id="l198"></a>sumption thereof by war.  A conflagration of the earth <a id="l199"></a>or turning a country into a Lake of fire, for the consumption <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> of a kingdom by war. The being in a furnace for the being <a id="l200"></a>in slavery under another nation. The ascending up of the <a id="l201"></a>smoak of any burning thing for ever &amp; ever, for the <a id="l202"></a>continuation of a conquered people under the misery of <a id="l203"></a>perpetual subjection &amp; slavery. The scorching heat of <a id="l204"></a>the Sun for vexatious warrs persecutions &amp; troubles in<a id="l205"></a>flicted by the king. Clouds whether in heaven or on earth <a id="l206"></a>for multitudes of men. Riding on the clouds for reigning <a id="l207"></a>over much people. Covering the Sun with a cloud or with <a id="l208"></a>smoak, for oppression of the king by the armies of an <a id="l209"></a>enemy. Tempestuous winds, (that is, the motion of clouds) <a id="l210"></a>for warrs. Thunder (that is, the voice of a cloud) for the <a id="l211"></a>voice of a multitude. A storm of thunder lightning, hail, <a id="l212"></a>&amp; overflowing rain for a tempest of war descending from <a id="l213"></a>the heavens &amp; clouds politique on the heads of their ene<a id="l214"></a>mies. Rain if not immoderate, &amp; dew; &amp; living water, for <a id="l215"></a>the graces &amp; doctrines of the spirit. And the defect of rain <a id="l216"></a>for spiritual barrenness.</p>
<p id="par14">In the Earth, the dry land &amp; congregated waters (as <a id="l217"></a>a Sea, a River, a Flood) are put for the peoples of several <a id="l218"></a>regions, nations, &amp; dominions. Embittering of waters for <a id="l219"></a>great affliction of the people by war &amp; persecution. Turning <a id="l220"></a>them to blood, for the mystical death of bodies politique, that <a id="l221"></a>is, for their dissolution. The overflowing of a sea or river <a id="l222"></a>for the invasion of the earth politique by the people of the <a id="l223"></a>waters. Drying up of waters, for the conquest of their <a id="l224"></a>regions by the earth. Fountains of water for cities the <a id="l225"></a>permanent heads of rivers politique.

Houses &amp; ships, for <a id="l230"></a> families assemblies &amp; towns in the earth &amp; sea politique. <a id="l231"></a>And a Navy of war-ships, for an army of the kingdom <a id="l232"></a>signified by the sea.</p>
<p id="par15">Also Animals &amp; Vegetables  are put for <a id="l233"></a>people of several regions &amp; conditions; &amp; particularly Trees <a id="l234"></a>hearbs &amp; land animals for the people of the earth <a id="l235"></a>politique. Flaggs Reeds &amp; Fishes for those of the waters <a id="l236"></a>politique. And Birds &amp; Insects for those of the politique <a id="l237"></a>heaven &amp; earth. A forest for a kingdom. Paradise for a <a id="l238"></a>flourishing &amp;  peaceable kingdom. And a wilderness <a id="l239"></a>for a desolate &amp; thin people.</p>
<p id="par16">If the world politique considered in Prophesy consists <a id="l240"></a>of many kingdoms, they are represented by as many parts <a id="l241"></a>of the world naturall: as the noblest by the celestial <a id="l242"></a>frame; &amp; then the Moon &amp; clouds are put for the com<a id="l243"></a>mon people. The less noble by the earth sea &amp; rivers <a id="l244"></a>&amp; by the animals or vegetables or buildings therein; <a id="l245"></a>&amp; then the greater &amp; more powerfull animals &amp; taller <a id="l246"></a>trees are put for Kings Princes &amp; Nobles. And because the <a id="l247"></a>whole kingdom is the body politique of the king, therefore <a id="l248"></a>the Sun, or a Tree or a Beast or Bird or Man whereby <a id="l249"></a>the King is represented, is put in a large signification for <a id="l250"></a>the whole Kingdom; &amp; several animals (as a Lyon, a Beare, <a id="l251"></a>a Leopard a Goat) according to their qualities, are put for <a id="l252"></a>several kingdoms &amp; bodies politique; &amp; sacrificing of beasts, for <a id="l253"></a>slaughtering &amp; conquering of kingdoms, &amp; friendship between <a id="l254"></a>Beasts for peace between kingdoms. Yet sometimes Vegetables <a id="l255"></a>&amp; Animals are by certain epithites or circumstances extended <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> to other significations; as a Tree when called the tree <a id="l256"></a>of life or of knowledge, &amp; a Beast when called the Old <a id="l257"></a>Serpent, or worshipped.</p>
<p id="par17">When a Beast or Man is put for a kingdome his parts <a id="l258"></a>&amp; qualities are put for the analogous parts &amp; qualities of <a id="l259"></a>the kingdome: as the head of a Beast for the great men <a id="l260"></a>who precede &amp; govern. The Tail for the inferior people <a id="l261"></a>who follow &amp; are governed. The heads, if more then <a id="l262"></a>one for the number of capital parts or dynasties or do<a id="l263"></a>minions in the kingdom whether collateral or successive <a id="l264"></a>with respect to the civil government. The horns on any <a id="l265"></a>head for the number of kingdoms in that head with <a id="l266"></a>respect to military power. Seeing for understanding, <a id="l267"></a>&amp; the eyes for men of understanding &amp; policy &amp; in matters <a id="l268"></a>of religion for Ε᾽πισκοποι Bishops. Speaking for <a id="l269"></a>making laws. The mouth for a lawgiver whether civil <a id="l270"></a>or sacred. The loudness of the voice for might &amp; power. <a id="l271"></a>The faintness thereof for weakness. Eating &amp; drinking <a id="l272"></a>for acquiring what is signified by  the things <a id="l273"></a>eaten &amp; drunken. The hairs of a Beast or Man &amp; the <a id="l274"></a>feathers of a Bird for people. The wings for the <a id="l275"></a><em class="underline">branches of a people spread abroad by conquest over <a id="l276"></a>other nations.</em><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> The arm of a Man for his power, or for <a id="l277"></a>any people wherein his strength &amp; power consists. His <a id="l278"></a>feet, for the lowest of the people, or for the latter end <a id="l279"></a>of the kingdom. The feet nails &amp; teeth of Beasts of prey <a id="l280"></a>for armies &amp; squadrons of armies. The bones for strength <a id="l281"></a>&amp; fortified places. The flesh for riches &amp; possessions. And <a id="l282"></a>the days of their continuing or acting, for years. And when <a id="l283"></a>a Tree is put for a kingdom, its branches leaves &amp; fruit <a id="l284"></a>signify as do the wings feathers &amp; food of a Bird or <a id="l285"></a>Beast.</p>
<p id="par18">When a Man is taken in a mystical sense, his <a id="l286"></a>qualities are often signified by his actions &amp; by the <a id="l287"></a>circumstances of things about him. So a Ruler is <a id="l288"></a>signified by his riding on a Beast: a Warrior &amp; Conqueror <a id="l289"></a>by his having a sword &amp; bow: a potent man by his gigantic <a id="l290"></a>stature: a Iudge by weights &amp; measures: a sentence <a id="l291"></a>of absolution or condemnation by a white or black stone: <a id="l292"></a>a new dignity by a new name: moral or civil qualifi<a id="l293"></a>cations by garments: honour &amp; glory by splendid apparel: <a id="l294"></a>royal dignity by purple or scarlet or by a crown: righte<a id="l295"></a>ousness by white &amp; clean robes: wickedness by spotted &amp; <a id="l296"></a>filthy garments: affliction mourning &amp; humiliation by <a id="l297"></a>cloathing in sackcloth: dishonour shame &amp; want of good <a id="l298"></a>works by nakedness: error &amp; misery by drinking a cup of <a id="l299"></a>his or her wine who causeth it: propagating any religion <a id="l300"></a>for gain by exercising trafick &amp; merchandise with <a id="l301"></a>that people whose religion it is: worshipping or serving <a id="l302"></a>the fals Gods of any nation by committing adultery with <a id="l303"></a>their Princes, or by worshipping them ✝<sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> <em class="underline">&amp; their image &amp; by <a id="l304"></a>blaspheming God, or by receiving their Mark or Name <a id="l305"></a>or the number thereof in the hand or forehead in token <a id="l306"></a>of servitude)</em>: overthrow in war by a wound of man or <a id="l307"></a>beast; a durable plague of war by a sore or pain; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> the affliction or persecution which a people suffers in la<a id="l308"></a>bouring to bring forth a new kingdom, by ✝<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> <em class="underline">pain in travail of <a id="l309"></a>a man child: the birth of a new kingdom by the birth of <a id="l310"></a>a manchild:</em> the dissolution of a body politick or ecclesiastick <a id="l311"></a>by the death of man or beast: &amp; the revival of a dissolved <a id="l312"></a>dominion by the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<p id="par19">Now according to this language the Lion, Beare, Leopard &amp; <a id="l316"></a>terrible Beast with ten horns in Daniels Prophesy of the four Beasts <a id="l317"></a>which arose successively out of the great sea in four great winds, <a id="l318"></a>will signify four  kingdoms which arose successively in four <a id="l319"></a>great warrs. The Lion had Eagles wings to denote the Provinces <a id="l320"></a>of Babylon &amp; Assyria, of which the first of the four kingdoms <a id="l321"></a>(the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar then in being,) from the time of <a id="l322"></a>the fall of the Assyrian Empire, was composed. For in a parallel <a id="l323"></a>vision of the statue of four metalls, Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l324"></a><em class="underline">Thou art this head of Gold; &amp; after thee shall arise another <a id="l325"></a>kingdom inferior to thee; &amp; another third kingdom of brass which <a id="l326"></a>shall bear rule over all the earth: &amp; the fourth kingdom shall <a id="l327"></a>be strong as iron</em>. The second Beast was therefore the kingdom <a id="l328"></a>which arose next after the Babylonian, &amp; this was the kingdom <a id="l329"></a>of the Medes &amp; Persians, Dan. V.28. This Beast was like a Bear <a id="l330"></a>&amp; <em class="underline">raised it self up on one side</em>, the Medes rising up first. <a id="l331"></a>And <em class="underline">it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it</em>. <a id="l332"></a>to signify the kingdoms of Sardes Babylon &amp; Egypt which were <a id="l333"></a>conquered by it but did not belong to its proper body. And <em class="underline">it de<a id="l334"></a>voured much flesh</em>, the riches of those three kingdoms. The third <a id="l335"></a>Beast was the kingdom which succeeded the Persian, &amp; this was <a id="l336"></a>the Empire of the Greeks, Dan. VIII.6, 7, 20, 21. It was like a Leopard <a id="l337"></a>to signify its fierceness, &amp; had <em class="underline">four heads.</em><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> &amp; four wings to sig<a id="l338"></a>nify that it should be divided into four kingdoms. For it conti<a id="l339"></a>nued in a monarchical form during the reign of Alexander the <a id="l340"></a>great &amp; his young sons Alexander &amp; Hercules, &amp; then brake <a id="l341"></a>into four kingdoms by the Governours of Provinces putting Crowns <a id="l342"></a>on their own heads &amp; reigning over their Provinces. Cassander reign<a id="l343"></a>ed over Macedon Greece &amp; Epire, Lysimachus over Thrace, Anti<a id="l344"></a>gonus over Syria &amp; the lesser Asia, &amp; Ptolomy over Egypt Libya &amp; <a id="l345"></a>Ethiopia. And these are all the nations belonging to  the body <a id="l346"></a>of the third Beast. These kingdoms underwent various changes, but <a id="l347"></a>none of them  became equal in dominion to that of Alexander <a id="l348"></a>the great, &amp; therefore the fourth Beast which was exceeding dreadfull <a id="l349"></a>&amp; terrible &amp; had great iron teeth &amp; devoured &amp; brake in pieces and <a id="l350"></a>stamped the residue with his feet, could be none of them, but must be <a id="l351"></a>the Roman Empire which conquered &amp; succeeded them. It conquered <a id="l352"></a>the kingdom of Macedon with Illyricum &amp; Epire in the eight year of Antiochus Epiphanes, An. Nabonass 580, it inherited that of Per<a id="l353"></a>gamus An. Nabonass. 615, &amp; conquered that of Syria An. Nabonass 679, <a id="l354"></a>&amp; that of Egypt An. Nabonass. 718; &amp; by these conquests became <a id="l355"></a>greater &amp; more terrible then any of the three former Beasts. <a id="l356"></a>And that the fourth Beast relates to the Roman Empire is con<a id="l357"></a>firmed by the Apostle Iohn who  names Daniels <a id="l358"></a>three first Beasts &amp; puts the Apocalyptic ten-horned Beast <a id="l359"></a>in the room of the fourth, saying: <em class="underline">And the</em> Beast <em class="underline">which I saw <a id="l360"></a>was like unto a</em> Leopard <em class="underline">&amp; his feet were as the feet of a</em> Bear <a id="l361"></a><em class="underline">&amp; his mouth as the mouth of a</em> Lion. This Empire  continues in its greatness till the reign of Theodosius the great &amp; then <a id="l362"></a>brake into ten kingdoms &amp; continued in a broken form till the <a id="l363"></a>Ancient of days sat in a throne like fiery flame, &amp; the judgment <a id="l364"></a>was set, &amp; the books were opened &amp; the Beast was slain &amp; his <a id="l365"></a>body given to the burning flames, &amp; one like the son of man came <a id="l366"></a>with the clouds of heaven, &amp; was brought before the ancient of <a id="l367"></a>days, &amp; received dominion over all nations, &amp; judgment was given <a id="l368"></a>to the saints of the most high, &amp; the time came that they possessed <a id="l369"></a>the kingdom. And in the like manner the Beast in the Apocalyps <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> continues till the Word of God the King of Kings &amp; Lord of Lords <a id="l370"></a>comes in heaven with an army upon white horses, &amp; the Beast <a id="l371"></a>is taken &amp; cast alive into the lake of fire, &amp; judgment is given <a id="l372"></a>to the saints raised from the dead, &amp; they reign with Christ. <a id="l373"></a>The two Beasts (that in Daniel &amp; that in Iohn) continue each <a id="l374"></a>of them to the day of judgment &amp; then perish alike &amp; therefore <a id="l375"></a>are the same &amp; signify the Roman western Empire still divided <a id="l376"></a>into many kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par20">I beheld, saith Daniel, till the Beast was slain &amp; his body <a id="l377"></a>destroyed &amp; given to the burning flames. As concerning the rest of <a id="l378"></a>the Beasts they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives <a id="l379"></a>were prolonged for a season &amp; a time. And therefore all the four <a id="l380"></a>Beasts are still alive, tho the dominion of the three first be taken <a id="l381"></a>away. The nations of Chaldea &amp; Assyria are still the first Beast. <a id="l382"></a>Those of Media &amp; Persia are still the second Beast. Those of Egypt <a id="l383"></a>Syria &amp; Asia minor, Macedon Greece &amp; Thrace are still the <a id="l384"></a>third, &amp; those of Europe on this side Greece are still the fourth. <a id="l385"></a>Seeing therefore that the body of the third Beast is confined to the <a id="l386"></a>nations on this side the river Euphrates, &amp; that the body of the <a id="l387"></a>fourth Beast is confined to the nations on this side Greece: we <a id="l388"></a>are to look for all the four heads of the third Beast among the <a id="l389"></a>nations on this side of the river Euphrates, &amp; for all the eleven <a id="l390"></a>horns of the fourth Beast among the nations on this side of Greece. <a id="l391"></a>And therefore at the breaking of the Greek Empire into four king<a id="l392"></a>doms of the Greeks, we reccon not the kingdom of Seleucus among <a id="l393"></a>the four because the Chaldeans Medes &amp; Persians over whom <a id="l394"></a>he reigned, belonged to the bodies of the two first Beasts. Nor do <a id="l395"></a>we reccon the Greek Empire seated at Constantinople among the <a id="l396"></a>horns of the fourth Beast, because it belonged to the body of the <a id="l397"></a>third.</p>

<p id="par23">Now the ten horns of the fourth Beast arose in the following manner.</p>
<p id="par24">Dacia was a large country bounded on the south <a id="l430"></a>by the Danube, on the east by the Euxine sea, on the north <a id="l431"></a>by the river Neister &amp; the mountain Crapac, &amp; on the west <a id="l432"></a>by the river Tibesis or Teys which runs southward into the <a id="l433"></a>Danube a little above Belgrade. It comprehended the coun<a id="l434"></a>tries now called Transylvania, Moldavia, &amp; Wallachia, &amp; <a id="l435"></a>the eastern part of the upper Hungary. Its ancient inhabi<a id="l436"></a>tants were called Getæ by the Greeks, Daci by the Latines <a id="l437"></a>&amp; Goths by themselves. Alexander the great attaqued them, <a id="l438"></a>&amp; Trajan conquered them &amp; reduced their country into a Pro<a id="l439"></a>vince of the Roman Empire: &amp; thereby the propagation of <a id="l440"></a>the Gospel among them was much promoted. They were <a id="l441"></a>composed of several Gothic nations called Ostrogoths, Visigoths, <a id="l442"></a>Vandals Gepides, Lombards, Burgundians, Alans, &amp;c: all which <a id="l443"></a>agreed in their manners &amp; spake the same language as <a id="l444"></a>Procopius  represents. While they lived under the Ro<a id="l445"></a>mans, the Goths or Ostrogoths were seated in the eastern <a id="l446"></a>parts of Dacia, the Vandals in the western part upon the <a id="l447"></a>river Teys where the rivers  Maresh &amp; Keresh run <a id="l448"></a>into it. The Visigoths were between them. The Gepides accord<a id="l449"></a>ing to Iornandes were  upon the Vistula. The <a id="l450"></a>Burgundians (a Vandalick nation) were between the Vistula <a id="l451"></a>&amp; the southern fountain of the Boristhenes at some distance <a id="l452"></a>from the mountain Crapac  northwards where Ptolomy <a id="l453"></a>places them by the names of Phrugundiones &amp; Burgiones. <a id="l454"></a>The Alans (another <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> Gothic nation) were between the <a id="l455"></a>northern fountain of the Boristhenes &amp; the mouth of the <a id="l456"></a>river Tanais where Ptolomy places the mountain Alanus. <a id="l457"></a>The Roxolani were on the southern coast of the Alans, <a id="l458"></a>&amp; western side of the Palus Mæotis.</p>
<p id="par25">These nations continued under the dominion of the <a id="l459"></a>Romans till the second year of the Emperor Philip, &amp; then <a id="l460"></a>for want of their pay began to revolt; &amp; the Ostrogoths <a id="l461"></a>set up a kingdom which under their kings Ostrogotha, Cniva, <a id="l462"></a>Araric, Geberic, &amp; Hermaneric increased till the year <a id="l463"></a>376; &amp; then by an incursion of the Huns from beyond the <a id="l464"></a>Tanais &amp; the death of Hermaneric, brake into several <a id="l465"></a>smaller kingdoms. Hunnimund the son of Hermaneric became <a id="l466"></a>king over the Ostrogoths; Fridigern over the Visigoths; <a id="l467"></a>Winithar or Vinithar over a part of the Goths called <a id="l468"></a>Gruthungi by Ammian, Gothunni by Claudian, &amp; Sarmatæ <a id="l469"></a>&amp; Scythians by others; Athanaric over another part of the <a id="l470"></a>Goths in Dacia called Thervingi; &amp; Box over the Antes in <a id="l471"></a>Sarmatia. And the Gepides had also their king. The Vandals <a id="l472"></a>fled over the Danube from Geberic in the latter end of the <a id="l473"></a>reign of Constantine the great, &amp; had seats granted to them <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span> in Pannonia by that Emperor, &amp; there lived quietly forty <a id="l474"></a>years, viz<sup>t</sup> till the year 377 when several Gothic nations <a id="l475"></a>flying from the Hunns came over the Danube &amp; had seats <a id="l476"></a>granted them in Mœsia &amp; Thrace by the Emperor Valens, <a id="l477"></a>but the next year (A.C. 378) revolted, called in some <a id="l478"></a>Goths Alans &amp; Hunns from beyond the Danube, routed <a id="l479"></a>the Roman army, slew the Emperor Valens, &amp; spread them<a id="l480"></a>selves into Greece &amp; Pannonia as far as to the Alps. But in <a id="l481"></a>the years 379 &amp; 380 they were checkt by the arms of the <a id="l482"></a>Emperors Gratian &amp; Theodosius, &amp; made a submissive peace, <a id="l483"></a>&amp; the Visigoths &amp; Thervingi returned to their seats in Mœsia <a id="l484"></a>&amp; Thrace, the Hunns returned over the Danube, &amp; the Alans <a id="l485"></a>&amp; Gruthungi obteined seats in Pannonia.</p>
<p id="par26">About the year 373 or 374, the Burgundians rose from <a id="l486"></a>their seats upon the Vistula with an army of eighty thousand <a id="l487"></a>men to invade Gallia; &amp; being opposed seated themselves upon <a id="l488"></a>the  northern side of the Rhene over against Mentz <a id="l489"></a>And in the year 358 a body of the Salian Franks with their <a id="l490"></a>king coming from the river Sala were received into the Empire by the Emperor Iulian <a id="l491"></a>&amp; seated in Gallia between Brabant &amp; the Rhene. And their <a id="l492"></a>King Mellobaudes was made Comes Domesticorum by the Empe<a id="l493"></a>ror Gratian. And Richomer another noble Salian Franck was made <a id="l494"></a>Comes Domesticorum &amp; Magister utriusque Militiæ by Theodosius, <a id="l495"></a>&amp; A.C. 384 was Consul with Clearchus. He was a great Favorite <a id="l496"></a>of Theodosius, &amp; accompanied him in his warrs against Eugenius, <a id="l497"></a>but died in the expedition, &amp; left a son called Theudemir, who <a id="l498"></a>afterwards became king of the Salian Franks in Brabant. <a id="l499"></a>In the time of this war some Franks from beyond the Rhene <a id="l500"></a>invaded Gallia under the conduct of Genobald, Marcomir &amp; <a id="l501"></a>Suno, but were repulsed by Stilico, &amp; Marcomir being slain <a id="l502"></a>was succeeded in Germany by his son Pharamund.</p>
<p id="par27">While these nations remained quiet within the Em<a id="l503"></a>pire subject to the Romans, many others continued beyond the <a id="l504"></a>Danube till the death of the Emperor Theodosius, &amp; then rose <a id="l505"></a>up in arms. For Paulus Diaconus in his Historia Miscella, <a id="l506"></a>Lib. XIV, speaking of the times next after the death of this Em<a id="l507"></a>peror, tells us: <em class="underline">Eodem tempore erant Gothi et aliæ gentes <a id="l508"></a>maximæ trans Danubium habitantes: ex quibus rationabiliores <a id="l509"></a>quatuor sunt Gothi scilicet, Huisogothi, Gepides &amp; Vandali, et <a id="l510"></a>nomen tantum et nihil aliud mutantes. Omnes autem fidei erant <a id="l511"></a>Arianæ malignitatis. Isti sub Arcadio et Honorio Danubium <a id="l512"></a>transeuntes locati sunt in terra Romanorum: et Gepides quidem <a id="l513"></a>(ex quibus postea divisa sunt Langobardi et Avares) villas <a id="l514"></a>quæ sunt circa Singidonum &amp; Sirmium habitavere</em>. And Proco<a id="l515"></a>pius in the beginning of his Historia Vandalica writes to the <a id="l516"></a>same purpose. Hitherto the western Empire continued entire <a id="l517"></a>but now by new commotions it brake into ten kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par28">Theodosius died A.C. 395, &amp; then the Visigoths under <a id="l518"></a>the conduct of Alaric the successor of Fridigern, rose from <a id="l519"></a>their seats in Thrace, &amp; wasted Macedon, Thessaly, Achaia, <a id="l520"></a>Peloponnesus &amp; Epire with fire &amp; sword five years together, <a id="l521"></a>&amp; then turning westward, invaded Dalmatia, Illyricum &amp; Pan<a id="l522"></a>nonia, &amp; from thence went into Italy A.C. 402, &amp; the next <a id="l523"></a>year were so beaten at Pollentia &amp; Verona by Stilico the <a id="l524"></a>commander of the forces of the western Empire, that Clau<a id="l525"></a>dian calls the remainder of the forces of Alaric <em class="underline">tanta ex gente <a id="l526"></a>reliquias breves</em>, &amp; Prudentius <em class="underline">Gentem deletam</em>. Thereupon <a id="l527"></a>Alaric made peace with the Emperor, being so far humbled <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span> that Orosius saith he did <em class="underline">pro pace optima &amp; quibuscunque <a id="l528"></a>sedibus suppliciter &amp; simpliciter orare</em>. This peace was ratified <a id="l529"></a>by mutual hostages &amp; Ætius was sent hostage to Alaric, &amp; <a id="l530"></a>therefore Alaric continued a free Prince in the seats now <a id="l531"></a>granted to him.</p>
<p id="par29">When Alaric took up arms the nations beyond the <a id="l532"></a>Danube began to be in motion, &amp; the next winter (the winter <a id="l533"></a>between A.C. 395 &amp; A.C. 396) a great body of Hunns, Alans, <a id="l534"></a>Ostrogoths, Gepides &amp; other northern nations came over the <a id="l535"></a>frozen Danube, being invited by Ruffin: &amp; their brethren <a id="l536"></a>also who had obteined seats within the Empire, took up arms. <a id="l537"></a>Ierome calls all this great multitude Hunns, Alans, Vandals, <a id="l538"></a>Goths, Sarmatans, Quades &amp; Marcomans; &amp; saith that they <a id="l539"></a>invaded all places between Constantinople &amp; the Iulian Alps, <a id="l540"></a>wasting Scythia, Thrace, Macedon, Dardania, Dacia, Thessaly, <a id="l541"></a>Achaia, Epire, Dalmatia, &amp; all Pannonia. And the Suevians <a id="l542"></a>also invaded Rhætia. For when Alaric ravaged Pannonia, <a id="l543"></a>the Romans were defending Rhætia, which gave Alaric an <a id="l544"></a>opportunity of invading Italy as Claudian thus mentions,</p>
<div class="lg"><p class="l">Non nisi perfidia nacti penetarbile tempus</p>
<p class="l">Irrupere Getæ, nostras dum Rhætia vires</p>
<p class="l">Occupat, atque alio desudant Marte cohortes.</p></div>
<p id="par30" class="i0">And when Alaric went from those parts into Italy, some <a id="l545"></a>other barbarous nations invaded Noricum &amp; Vindelicia, as the <a id="l546"></a>same Poet Claudian thus mentions,</p>
<div class="lg"><p class="l10">Iam fædera gentes</p>
<p class="l">Exuerant, Latijque audita clade feroces</p>
<p class="l">Vendelicos saltus et Norica rura tenebant.</p></div>
<p id="par31" class="i0">This was in the years 402 &amp; 403. And among these nations <a id="l547"></a>I reccon the Suevians Quades &amp; Marcomans. For they were <a id="l548"></a>all in arms at this time &amp; the Quades &amp; Marcomans were <a id="l549"></a>Suevian nations, &amp; they &amp; the Suevians came originally from <a id="l550"></a>Bohemia &amp; the river Suevus or Sprahe in Lusatia, &amp; were <a id="l551"></a>now unified under one common king called Ermeric, who <a id="l552"></a>soon after led them into Gallia. The Vandals &amp; Alans <a id="l553"></a>might also about this time extend themselves into Noricum. <a id="l554"></a>Also Vldin with a great body of Hunns passed the Danube <a id="l555"></a>about the time of Chrysostom's banishment, that is, A.C. 404, <a id="l556"></a>&amp; wasted Thrace &amp; Mœsia. And Radagaisus king of the <a id="l557"></a>Gruthunni &amp; successor of Winithar, inviting over more <a id="l558"></a>barbarians from beyond the Danube, invaded Italy with an <a id="l559"></a>army of above two hundred thousand Goths, &amp; the next <a id="l560"></a>year (A.C. 405 or 406) was overcome by Stilico, &amp; perished <a id="l561"></a>with his army. In this war Stilico was assisted by a great <a id="l562"></a>body of Hunns &amp; Ostrogoths under the conduct of Vldin <a id="l563"></a>&amp; Sarus. They were hired by the Emperor Honorius. And <a id="l564"></a>in all this confusion it was necessary for the Lombards in <a id="l565"></a>Pannonia to arm themselves in their own defense  &amp; <a id="l566"></a>assert their liberty, the Romans being no longer able to <a id="l567"></a>protect them.</p>
<p id="par32">And now Stilico purposing to make himself Emperor pro<a id="l568"></a>cured a military Præfecture for Alaric, &amp; sent him into the <a id="l569"></a>east in service of Honorius the western Emperor, com<a id="l570"></a>mitting some Roman troops to his conduct to strengthen his <a id="l571"></a>army of Goths, &amp; promising to follow soon after with his own <a id="l572"></a>army. His pretense was to recover some regions of Illyricum <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013r"> &lt;13r&gt; </span> which the eastern Emperor was accused to detein injuriously <a id="l573"></a>from the western: but his secret designe was to make him<a id="l574"></a>self Emperor by the assistance of the Vandals &amp; their allys. <a id="l575"></a>For he himself was a Vandal. And for facilitating this design <a id="l576"></a>he invited a great body of the barbarous nations to invade the <a id="l577"></a>western Empire while he &amp; Alaric invaded the eastern. And these <a id="l578"></a>nations under their several kings, the Vandals under Godegisilus <a id="l579"></a>the Alans in two bodies, the one under Goar the other under Re<a id="l580"></a>splendial, &amp; the Suevians Quades &amp; Marcomans under Ermeric, <a id="l581"></a>marched through Rhetia to the side of the Rhene, leaving their <a id="l582"></a>seats in Pannonia to the Hunns &amp; Ostrogoths, &amp; joyned the Burgundians under Gundicar, &amp; ruffled the Franks in their further march, <a id="l584"></a>&amp; on the last day of December A.C. 406 passed the Rhene at <a id="l585"></a>Mentz &amp; diffused themselves into Germania prima &amp; the adjacent <a id="l586"></a>regions, &amp; amongst other actions the Vandals took Trevirs. Then <a id="l587"></a>they advanced into Belgium &amp; began to  ruffle that country. Where<a id="l588"></a>upon the Salian Franks look up arms &amp; under the conduct of <a id="l589"></a>Theudemir the son of Ricimer or Richomer above mentioned made <a id="l590"></a>so stout a resistance that they slew almost twenty thousand <a id="l591"></a>of the Vandals with their king Godegisilus in battel, the rest <a id="l592"></a>escaping only by a part of Resplendials Alans which came <a id="l593"></a>timely to their assistance.</p>
<p id="par33">Then the British soldiers allarmed by the rumour of these <a id="l594"></a>things, revolted &amp; set up Tyrants there; first Marcus whom they <a id="l595"></a>slew presently, then Gratian whom they slew within four <a id="l596"></a>months, &amp; lastly Constantine under whom they invaded Gallia <a id="l597"></a>A.C. 408, being favoured by Goar &amp; Gundicar. And Constan<a id="l598"></a>tine having possessed a good part of Gallia, created his son <a id="l599"></a>Constans Cæsar &amp; sent him into Spain to order his affairs <a id="l600"></a>there, A.C. 409.</p>
<p id="par34">In the mean time Resplendial seeing the aforesaid disaster <a id="l601"></a>of the Vandals, &amp; that Goar was gone over to the Romans, led his <a id="l602"></a>army from the Rhene, &amp; together with the Suevians &amp; residue of <a id="l603"></a>the Vandals went towards Spain, the Franks in the mean time <a id="l604"></a>prosecuting their victory so far as to retake Trevirs, which, after <a id="l605"></a>they had plundered it, they left to the Romans. The barbarians <a id="l606"></a>were at first stopt by the Pyrenean mountains, which made them <a id="l607"></a>diffuse themselves into Aquitain: but the next year they had the <a id="l608"></a>passage betrayed to them by some soldiers of Constans, &amp; entring <a id="l609"></a>Spain 4 Kal. Octob. A.C. 409, every one Conquered what he <a id="l610"></a>could, &amp; at length (A.C. 411) they divided their conquests by lot, <a id="l611"></a>&amp; the Vandals obteined Bœtica &amp; part of Gallæcia, the Suevians <a id="l612"></a>the rest of Gallæcia &amp; the Alans Lusitania &amp; the Carthaginensian <a id="l613"></a>Province, the Emperor for the sake of peace confirming them <a id="l614"></a>in those seats by grant A.C. 413.</p>
<p id="par35">Also the Roman Franks above mentioned having made Theu<a id="l615"></a>demir their king, began streight after their conquest of the <a id="l616"></a>Vandals to invade their neighbours. The first they set upon <a id="l617"></a>were the ✝<sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> Galls of Brabant; but meeting with notable resistance <a id="l618"></a>they desired their alliance. And so those Galls fell off from <a id="l619"></a>the Romans, &amp; made an intimate league with the Franks to be <a id="l620"></a>as one people, marrying with one another &amp; conforming to one <a id="l621"></a>anothers manners till they became one without distinction. Thus <a id="l622"></a>by the access of these Galls, &amp; of the forreign Franks also who <a id="l623"></a>afterwards came over the Rhene, the Salian kingdom soon grew <a id="l624"></a>very great &amp; powerfull.</p>
<p id="par36">Stilico's expedition against the Greek Emperor was stopt by the <a id="l625"></a>order of Honorius, &amp; then Alaric came out of Epire into Noricum, &amp; requested a summ of money for his service. The Senate were inclined <a id="l626"></a>to deny him, but by Stilico's mediation granted it. But after a while <a id="l627"></a>Stilico being accused of a traiterous conspiracy with Alaric &amp; <a id="l628"></a>slain 10 Kal Sept. A.C. 408, &amp; Alaric thereby disappointed of his <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> money, &amp; reputed an enemy to the Empire, brake streight into Italy <a id="l629"></a>with his army which he brought out of  Epire, &amp; sent to his brother <a id="l630"></a>Adolphus to follow him with what other forces he had in Pannonia, <a id="l631"></a>which were not great but yet not to be despised. Thereupon Honorius <a id="l632"></a>fearing to be shut up in Rome, retired to Ravenna in October A.C. 408, <a id="l633"></a>&amp; from that time Ravenna continued to be the seat of the western <a id="l634"></a>Emperors. In those days the Hunns also invaded Pannonia, &amp; seizing the <a id="l635"></a>deserted seats of the Vandals Alans &amp; Goths, founded a new kingdom <a id="l636"></a>there. And Alaric advancing to Rome beseiged it, &amp; 9 Kal. Sept. A.C. 410, <a id="l637"></a>took it: &amp; afterwards attempting to pass into Afric was shipwrackt. <a id="l638"></a>After which Honorius made peace with him, &amp; got up an army to <a id="l639"></a>send against the Tyrant Constantine.</p>
<p id="par37">At the same time Gerontius one of Constantines Captains, revolted <a id="l640"></a>from him, &amp; set up Maximus Emperor in Spain. Whereupon Constan<a id="l641"></a>tine sent Edobec, another of his Captains to draw to his assistance, beside <a id="l642"></a>the barbarians under Goar &amp; Gundicar in Gallia, supplies of Franks &amp; <a id="l643"></a>Alemans from beyond the Rhene; &amp; committed the custody of Vienna in <a id="l644"></a>Narbonne to his son Constans. Gerontius advancing first slew Constans <a id="l645"></a>at Vienna &amp; then began to besiege Constantine at Arles. But Honorius <a id="l646"></a>at the same time sending Constantius with an army on the same errand, <a id="l647"></a>Gerontius fled, &amp; Constantius continued the siege, being strengthened by <a id="l648"></a>the access of the greatest part of the soldiers of Gerontius. After four <a id="l649"></a>months seige, Edobec having procured succours, the barbarian kings at <a id="l650"></a>Ments, Goar &amp; Gundicar, constitute Iovinus Emperor, &amp; together with <a id="l651"></a>him set forward to relieve Arles. At their approach Constantius retired, <a id="l652"></a>they pursued &amp; he beat them by surprize; but not prosecuting his victory <a id="l653"></a>the Barbarians soon recovered  themselves, yet not so as to <a id="l654"></a>hinder the fall of the Tyrants Constantine Iovinus &amp; Maximus. But <a id="l655"></a>Britain could not be recovered to the Empire, but remained ever <a id="l656"></a>after a distinct kingdom.</p>
<p id="par38">The next year (A.C. 412) the Visigoths being beaten in Italy, had <a id="l657"></a>Aquitain granted them to retire into, &amp; they invaded it with much violence, <a id="l658"></a>causing the Alans &amp; Burgundians to retreat who were then depopulating <a id="l659"></a>it. At the same time the Burgundians were brought to peace, &amp; the <a id="l660"></a>Emperor granted them for inheritance a region upon the Rhene which <a id="l661"></a>they had invaded. And the same I presume he did with the Alans. But <a id="l662"></a>the Franks not long after retaking &amp; burning Trevirs, Castinus A.C. <a id="l663"></a>415, was sent against them with an army, &amp; routed them &amp; slew <a id="l664"></a>Theudemir their king. This was the second taking of Trevirs by <a id="l665"></a>the Franks. And Merovæus about the year 448 took it again &amp; <a id="l666"></a>destroyed it. It was therefore taken four times, once by the Vandals <a id="l667"></a>&amp; thrice by the Franks. Theudemir was succeeded by Pharamund <a id="l668"></a>a Prince of the Salian Franks in Germany. From thence he brought new <a id="l669"></a>forces, reigned over the whole &amp; had seats granted to his people within <a id="l670"></a>the  Empire neare the Rhene.</p>
<p id="par39">And now the Barbarians were all quieted &amp; setled in several <a id="l671"></a>kingdoms within the Empire, not only by conquest but also by the <a id="l672"></a>grants of the Emperor Honorius. For Rutilius in his Itinerary written <a id="l673"></a>in Autumn Anno Vrbis 1169, that is (according to Varro's computation <a id="l674"></a>then in use) A.C. 416, thus laments the wasted fields</p>
<div class="lg"><p class="l">Illa quidem longis nimium deformia bellis; &amp; then adds</p>
<p class="l">Iam tempus laceris post longa incendia fundis</p>
<p>Vel pastorales ædificare casas. And a little after</p>
<p class="l">Æternum tibi Rhenus aret.</p></div>
<p id="par40" class="i0">And Orosius in the end of his History which was finished A.C. 417, repre<a id="l675"></a>sents now a general pacification of the barbarous nations by the <a id="l676"></a>words <em class="underline">comprimere</em>, <em class="underline">coangustare</em>, <em class="underline">addicere gentes immanissimas</em>, <a id="l677"></a>terming them <em class="underline">imperio addictas</em> because they had obteined seats in the <a id="l678"></a>Empire by league &amp; compact, &amp; <em class="underline">coangustatas</em> because they did no <a id="l679"></a>longer invade all regions at pleasure, but by the same compact <a id="l680"></a>remained quiet within the seats granted them.</p>
<p id="par41">Now by the wars above described, the western Empire was <a id="l681"></a>broken into the following kingdoms</p>
<p id="par42" class="i10">1 The kingdom of the Vandals &amp; Alans in Spain &amp; Afric.</p>
<p id="par43" class="i10">2 The kingdom of the Suevians.</p>

<p id="par51" class="i10">10 The kingdom of Ravenna.</p>
<p id="par52" class="i0"> Seven of these kingdoms are thus mentioned by Sigonius. <em class="underline"><sup>1</sup> Honorio <a id="l682"></a>regnate, in Pannoniam <sup>2</sup> Hunni, in Hispaniam <sup>3</sup> Vandali, <sup>4</sup> Alani <a id="l683"></a><sup>5</sup> Suevi et <sup>6</sup> Gothi, in Galliam <sup>4</sup> Alani <sup>7</sup> Burgundiones &amp; <sup>6</sup>Gothi certis <a id="l684"></a>sedibus permissis accepti</em>. In the same reign the Britains &amp; Franks <a id="l685"></a>revolted  from the Romans, &amp; the Lombards came <a id="l686"></a>into the Empire with the Gepides. But let us view them severally.</p>
<p id="par53">1. The kings of the Vandals were A.C. 406 Godegisilus, 407 Gun<a id="l687"></a>deric, 426 Geiseric, 477 Huneric, 484 Gundemund, 496 Thrasamund, <a id="l688"></a>523 Geiseric, 530 Gelimer. Godegisilus led them into Gallia A.C. <a id="l689"></a>406, Gunderic into Spain A.C. 409, Geiseric into Afric A.C. 427, &amp; <a id="l690"></a>Gelimer was conquered by Belisarius A.C. 533. Their kingdom stood <a id="l691"></a>in Gallia Spain &amp; Afric together 126 years, &amp; in Afric they were <a id="l692"></a>very potent. The Alans had only two kings ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 14v &gt; </span> ✝The Alans  in Spain had two kings of their own Resplendial &amp; Ataces, Vtacus or Othacar. Vnder Resplendial they went into France A.C. 407 &amp; into Spain A.C. 409 <a id="l693"></a>And Ataces was slain with almost all his army by Vallia king of the <a id="l694"></a>Visigoths A.C. 419. And then the remainder of these Alans subjected <a id="l695"></a>themselves to Gunderic king of the Vandals in Bœtica, &amp; went after<a id="l696"></a>wards with them into Afric as I learn out of Procopius. And thence <a id="l697"></a>the kings of the Vandals stiled themselves kings of the Vandals &amp; <a id="l698"></a>Alans, as may be seen in the  Edict of Hunneric recited by Victor <a id="l699"></a>in his history of the Vandalic persecution. In conjunction with the <a id="l700"></a>Catthi these Alans gave the name of Cathalaunia (or Catth-Alania) <a id="l701"></a>to the Province which is still so called. These Alans had also Gepides <a id="l702"></a>among them, &amp; therefore the  Gepides came into Pannonia before <a id="l703"></a>the Alans left it. There they became subject to the Hunns <a id="l704"></a>till the death of Attila A.C. 454, &amp; at length were conquered <a id="l705"></a>by the Ostrogoths.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 15r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par54">2 The kings of the Suevians were A.C. 406 Ermeric, 438 <a id="l706"></a>Rechila, 448 Rechiarius, 458 Maldra, 460 Frumarius, 463 Re<a id="l707"></a>mismundus. And after some other kings whose names are unknown, <a id="l708"></a>reigned A.C. 558 Theodemir, 568 Miro, 582 Euboricus, &amp; 583 An<a id="l709"></a>deca. This kingdom after it had been once seated in Spain remained always <a id="l710"></a>in Gallæcia &amp; Lusitania. Ermeric after the fall of the Alan <a id="l711"></a>kingdom, enlarged it into all Gallicia forcing the Vandals to <a id="l712"></a>retire into Bœtica &amp; the Carthaginensian Province. This king<a id="l713"></a>dom lasted 177 years according to Isidorus, &amp; then was subdued by <a id="l714"></a>Leovigildus king of the Visigoths &amp; made a Province of his <a id="l715"></a>kingdom A.C. 585.</p>
<p id="par55">3. The kings of the Visigoths were A.C. 400  <a id="l716"></a>Alaric, 410 Athaulphus, 415 Sergeric &amp; Vallia, 419 Theoderic <a id="l717"></a>451 Thorismund, 452 Theoderic, 465 Euric, 482 Alaric, <a id="l718"></a>505 Gensalaric, 526 Amalaric, 531 Theudius, 548 Theudis<a id="l719"></a>clus &amp;c. I date this kingdom from the time that Alaric <a id="l720"></a>left Thrace &amp; Greece to invade the western Empire. <a id="l721"></a>In the end of the reign of Athaulphus the Goths were <a id="l722"></a>humbled by the Romans, &amp; attempted to pass out of France into <a id="l723"></a>Spain. Sergeric reigned but a few days. In the beginning of Vallias <a id="l724"></a>reign they assaulted the Romans afresh, but were again repulsed <a id="l725"></a>&amp; then made peace on this condition that they should on the be<a id="l726"></a>half of the Empire invade the barbarian kingdoms  in Spain. <a id="l727"></a>And this they did together with the Romans in the years 417 &amp; <a id="l728"></a>418 overthrowing the Alans &amp; part of the Vandals. And then they <a id="l729"></a>received Aquitain of the Emperor by a full donation, leaving <a id="l730"></a>their conquests in Spain to the Emperor. And thereby the seats <a id="l731"></a>of the conquered Alans came into the hands of the Romans. <a id="l732"></a>In the year 455 Theoderic (assisted by the Burgundians) in<a id="l733"></a>vaded Spain, which was then almost all subject to the Suevians, <a id="l734"></a>&amp; took a part of it from them. A.C. 506 the Goths were <a id="l735"></a>driven out of Gallia by the Franks. A.C. 585 they conquered <a id="l736"></a>the Suevian kingdom &amp; became Lords of all Spain. A.C. 713 the <a id="l737"></a>Saracens invaded them, but in time they recovered their do<a id="l738"></a>minions &amp; have reigned in Spain ever since.</p>
<p id="par56">4. The kings of the Alans in Gallia were Goar, Sambida, <a id="l739"></a>Eocharic, Sangibanus, Beurgus, &amp;c. Vnder Goar they invaded Gallia <a id="l740"></a>A.C. 407, &amp; had seats given them neare the Rhene A.C. 412. Vnder <a id="l741"></a>Sambida (whom Bucher puts the successor if not the son of Goar) <a id="l742"></a>they had the territories of Valence given them by Ætius the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span> Emperor's Generall A.C. 440. Vnder Eocharic they conquered a <a id="l743"></a>region of the rebelling Galli Arborici given them by Ætius. This <a id="l744"></a>region was from them named Alenconium quasi Alanorum <a id="l745"></a>conventus. Vnder Sangibanus they were invaded &amp; their regal <a id="l746"></a>city Orleans beseiged by Attila king of the Hunns with a vast <a id="l747"></a>army of 500000. And Ætius &amp; the barbarian kings of Gallia <a id="l748"></a>came to raise the siege &amp; beat the Hunns in a very memorable <a id="l749"></a>battel A.C. 451 in campis Catalaunicis so called from these Alans <a id="l750"></a>mixt with the Chatti. The region is now contractly called Cam<a id="l751"></a>pain. In that battel were slain on both sides 162000. A year or <a id="l752"></a>two after, Attila returned with an immense army to conquer this <a id="l753"></a>kingdom, but was again beaten by them &amp; the Visigoths together <a id="l754"></a>in a battel of three days  continuance, with a slaughter <a id="l755"></a>almost as great as the former. Vnder Beurgus or Biorgor they <a id="l756"></a>infested Gallia round about till the reign of Maximus the Emperor, <a id="l757"></a>&amp; then they past the Alps in winter &amp; came into Liguria but were <a id="l758"></a>there beaten &amp; Beurgus slain by Ricimer commander of the Empe<a id="l759"></a>rors forces A.C. 464. Afterwards they were again beaten by the <a id="l760"></a>joynt force of Odoacer king of Italy &amp; Childeric king of the <a id="l761"></a>Francks about the year 480, &amp; again by Theudebert king of the <a id="l762"></a>Austrian Francks about the year 511.</p>
<p id="par57">5. The kings of the Burgundians were A.C. 407 Gundicar <a id="l763"></a>436 Gundioc, 467 Bilimer, 473 Gundobaldus with his brothers, 510 <a id="l764"></a>Sigismund, 517 Godomarus. Vnder Gundicar they invaded Gallia A.<a id="l765"></a>C. 407, &amp; had seats given them by the Emperor neare the Rhene in <a id="l766"></a>Gallia Belgica A.C. 412. They had Saxons among them, &amp; were now <a id="l767"></a>so potent that Orosius A.C. 417 wrote of them: <em class="underline">Burgundionum esse <a id="l768"></a>prævalidam et perniciosam manum, Galliæ hodieque testes sunt, <a id="l769"></a>in quibus præsumpta possessione consistunt</em>. About the year 435 <a id="l770"></a>they received great overthrows by Ætius, &amp; soon after by the <a id="l771"></a>Hunns, but five years after had Savoy granted them to be shared <a id="l772"></a>with the inhabitants, &amp; from that time became again a potent <a id="l773"></a>kingdom, being bounded by the river Rhodanus, but afterwards <a id="l774"></a>extending much further into the heart of Gallia. Gundobald <a id="l775"></a>conquered the regions about the rivers Araris &amp; Rhodanus with <a id="l776"></a>the territories of Marseille, &amp; invaded Italy in the times of the <a id="l777"></a>Emperor Glycerius, &amp; conquered all his brethren. Godomarus <a id="l778"></a>made Orleans his royal seat. Whence the kingdom was called <a id="l779"></a><em class="underline">regnum Aurelianorum</em>. He was conquered by Clotharius &amp; <a id="l780"></a>Childebert kings of the Franks A.C. 526. And from thence <a id="l781"></a>forward this kingdom was sometimes united to the kingdom of <a id="l782"></a>the Franks &amp; sometimes divided from it till the reign of Charles <a id="l783"></a> the great who made his son Carolottus king of Burgundy; from <a id="l784"></a>which time for above 300 years together, it enjoyed its proper <a id="l785"></a>kings, &amp; was then broken into the Dukedom of Burgundy &amp; <a id="l786"></a>County of Burgundy &amp; County of Savoy; &amp; afterwards those <a id="l787"></a>were broken into other lesser Counties.</p>
<p id="par58">6. The kings of the Franks were A.C. 407 Theudemir, <a id="l788"></a>417 Pharamund, 428 Clodio, 448 Merovæus, 456 Childeric, <a id="l789"></a>482 Clodovæus, &amp;c. Windeline &amp; Bucher, two of the most <a id="l790"></a>diligent searchers into the originals of this kingdom, make it <a id="l791"></a>begin the same year with the Barbarian invasions of Gallia, that <a id="l792"></a>is, A.C. 407. Of the first kings there is in Labbee's Bibliotheca <a id="l793"></a>M.S. this record.</p>
<p id="par59" class="cent">Historica quædam excerpta ex veteri stemmate Genealogico <a id="l794"></a><br>Regum Franciæ</p>

<p id="par64">Now for Genobaldus Marcomer &amp; Suno, they were captains <a id="l801"></a>of the transrhenane Franks in the reign of Theodosius &amp; concern <a id="l802"></a>us not. We are to begin with Theudemer the first king of the <a id="l803"></a>rebelling Salij, called Didio by Ivo Carnotensis, &amp; Thiedo &amp; Theu<a id="l804"></a>demerus by Rhenanus. His face is extant in a coin of gold found <a id="l805"></a>with this inscription THEVDEMER REX published by Petavius &amp; still <a id="l806"></a>or lately extant as Windeline testifies: which shews that he was a <a id="l807"></a>king, &amp; that in Gallia seeing rude Germany understood not then <a id="l808"></a>the coining of money, nor used either Latin words or letters. He <a id="l809"></a>was the son of Richemer or Richomer the favorite of the Emperor <a id="l810"></a>Theodosius, &amp; so being a Roman Franck &amp; of the Salian royal blood, <a id="l811"></a>they therefore upon the rebellion made him king. The whole time <a id="l812"></a>of his reign you have stated in Excerptis Gregorij Turonensis e <a id="l813"></a>Fredigario, cap. 5, 6, 7, 8, where the making him king, the tyranny <a id="l814"></a>of Iovinus, the slaughter of the associates of Iovinus, the second <a id="l815"></a>taking of Trevirs by the Franks, &amp; their war with Castinus in <a id="l816"></a>which this king was slain, are as a series of successive things <a id="l817"></a>thus set down in order. <em class="underline">Extinctis ducibus in Francis denuo <a id="l818"></a>Reges creantur ex eædem stirpe quo prius fuerant. Eodem <a id="l819"></a>tempore Iovinus ornatus regios assumpsit.

Multi nobilium jusse Iovini <a id="l822"></a>apud Avernis capti, &amp; a ducibus Honorij crudeliter interempti sunt. <a id="l823"></a>Trevirorum civitas factione unius ex senatoribus, nomine Lucij, a <a id="l824"></a>Francis capta et incensa est.</em> – <em class="underline">Castinus Domesticorum Comes <a id="l825"></a>expeditionem accipit contra Francos</em> &amp;c. Then returning to <a id="l826"></a>speak of Theudemer he adds: <em class="underline">Franci electum a se regem <a id="l827"></a>Sicut prius fuerat crinitum inquirentes diligenter ex genere. <a id="l828"></a>Priami Frigi et Francionis super se crearunt, nomine Theu<a id="l829"></a>demerum, filium Richimeris, qui in hoc prælio quod supra memi<a id="l830"></a>ni, a Romanis interfectus est</em>, that is, in the battel with Castin's <a id="l831"></a>army. Of his death Gregory Turonensis makes this further men<a id="l832"></a>tion. <em class="underline">In consularibus legimus Theodemerem regem Francorum <a id="l833"></a>filium Ricimeris quondam et Ascilam matrem ejus, gladio inter<a id="l834"></a>fectos.</em></p>
<p id="par65"> Vpon this victory of the Romans the Franks &amp; rebelling <a id="l835"></a>Galls, who in the time of Theudemer were in war with one another, <a id="l836"></a>united to strengthen themselves, as Ordericus Vitalis thus mentions:<sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> <a id="l837"></a><em class="underline">Cum Galli prius contra Romanos rebellassent, Franci ijs sociati <a id="l838"></a>sunt, et pariter juncti Ferramundum Sunonis Ducis filium <a id="l839"></a>sibi regem præfecerunt</em>. Prosper sets down the time. <em class="underline">Anno 25 <a id="l840"></a>Honorij, Pharamundus regnat in Francia</em>. This Bucher well <a id="l841"></a>referrs to the end of the year 416 or the beginning of the next <a id="l842"></a>year, dating the years of Honorius from the death of Valentinian <a id="l843"></a>&amp; argues well that at this time Pharamund was not only king by <a id="l844"></a>constitution of the Franks but crowned also by the consent of <a id="l845"></a>Honorius, &amp; had a part of Gallia assigned to him by covenant. And <a id="l846"></a>this I suppose might be the cause that Roman writers recconed <a id="l847"></a>him the first king. Which some not understanding have reputed him <a id="l848"></a>the founder of this kingdom by an army of the transrhenane Franks. <a id="l849"></a>And he might come with such an army, but he succeeded Theudemer <a id="l850"></a>by right of blood &amp; consent of the people. For the above cited passage <a id="l851"></a>of Fredegarius, <em class="underline">Extinctis ducibus, in Francis denuo Reges creantur <a id="l852"></a>ex eadem stirpe quæ prius</em>, implies that the kingdom continued to <a id="l853"></a>the new elected family during the reign of more kings then one. If <a id="l854"></a>you date the years of Honorius from the death of his father, the reign <a id="l855"></a>of Pharamund might begin two years later then is assigned by Bucher. <a id="l856"></a>The Salique laws made in his reign which are yet extant, shew by <a id="l857"></a>their name that it was the kingdom of the Salij over which he <a id="l858"></a>reigned, &amp; by the pecuniary mulcts in them that the place where <a id="l859"></a>he reigned abounded very much with money, &amp; consequently was <a id="l860"></a>within the Empire, rude Germany not knowing the use of money <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span> till they mixed with the Romans. Also in the Preface to the Salique <a id="l861"></a>Laws (written &amp; prefixed to them soon after the conversion of the Franks <a id="l862"></a>to the Christian religion, that is, in the end of the reign of Merovæus <a id="l863"></a>or soon after,) the original of this kingdom is thus described. <em class="underline">Hæc enim <a id="l864"></a>gens quæ fortis dum esset et robore valida Romanorum jugum du<a id="l865"></a>rissimum de suis cervicibus excussit pugnando</em> &amp;c This kingdom <a id="l866"></a>therefore was erected not by invasion but by rebellion as was described <a id="l867"></a>above. Prosper in regestring their kings in order tells us, <em class="underline">Pharamund<a id="l868"></a>us regnat in Francia; Clodio regnat in Francia; Merovæus regnat <a id="l869"></a>in Francia</em>: &amp; who can imagin but that in all these places he meant <a id="l870"></a>one &amp; the same <em class="underline">Francia</em>? &amp; yet it's certain that the Francia of Me<a id="l871"></a>rovæus was in Gallia.</p>
<p id="par66">Yet the father of Pharamund being king of a body of Franks <a id="l872"></a>in Germany in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius, as above, Pharamund <a id="l873"></a>might reign over the same Franks in Germany before he succeeded Theu<a id="l874"></a>demer in the kingdom of the Salians within the Empire, &amp; even before <a id="l875"></a>Theudemer began his reign; suppose in the first year of Honorius <a id="l876"></a>when those Franks being repulsed by Stilico lost their kings Marcomir <a id="l877"></a>&amp; Suno, one of which was the father of Pharamund. And the Roman <a id="l878"></a>Franks after the death of Theudemir, might invite Pharamund <a id="l879"></a>with his people from beyond the Rhene. But we are not here to <a id="l880"></a>regard the reign of Pharamund in Germany. We are to date this <a id="l881"></a>kingdom from its rise  within the Empire, &amp; to look upon <a id="l882"></a>it as only strengthened by the access of other Franks coming from <a id="l883"></a>beyond the Rhene whether in the reign of this king of in that of <a id="l884"></a>his successor Clodio. For in the last year of Pharamund's reign Ætius <a id="l885"></a>took from him a part of his possession in Gallia: but his successor <a id="l886"></a>Clodio (whom Fredagarius represents the son of Theudemer, &amp; some <a id="l887"></a>call Clogio, Cloio &amp; Claudius) inviting from beyond the Rhene a <a id="l888"></a>great body of Franks, recovered all, &amp; carried on their conquests as <a id="l889"></a>far as the river Some. And then those Franks dividing conquests with <a id="l890"></a>him, erected certain new kingdoms at Colen &amp; Cambray &amp; some other <a id="l891"></a>cities: all which were afterwards conquered by Clodovæus who also <a id="l892"></a>drave the Goths out of Gallia, &amp; placed his seat at Paris where it <a id="l893"></a>has continued ever since. And this was the originall of the present <a id="l894"></a>kingdom of France.</p>
 <p id="par67">7. The kings of Britain were A.C. 407 or 408 Marcus Gratian &amp; <a id="l895"></a>Constantine successively. A.C. 425 Vortigern, 466 Aurelius Ambro<a id="l896"></a>sius, 498 Vther Pendraco, 508 Arthur, 542 Constantinus, 545 Au<a id="l897"></a>relius Cunanus, 578 Vortiporeus, 581 Malgo, 586 Careticus, 613 <a id="l898"></a>Cadwan, 635 Calwalin, 676 Cadwalader. The three first were <a id="l899"></a>Tyrants who revolted from the Empire. Orosius Prosper &amp; Zosimus <a id="l900"></a>connect their revolt with the irruption of the barbarians into Gallia <a id="l901"></a>as consequent thereunto. And Prosper (with whom Zosimus agrees) <a id="l902"></a>puts it in the year which began the day after the irruption. The <a id="l903"></a>just time I thus collect. Marcus reigned not many days, Gratian four months, <a id="l904"></a>&amp; Constantine three years. He was slain the year after the sacking of <a id="l905"></a>Rome, that is A.C. 411; 14 Cal. Octob. Whence the revolt was in Spring <a id="l906"></a>A.C. 408. Sozomen joins Constantines expedition into Gallia with <a id="l907"></a>Arcadius's death or the times a little after, &amp; Arcadius died A.C. <a id="l908"></a>408 May the 1<sup>st</sup>. Now tho the reign of these Tyrants was but <a id="l909"></a>short yet they gave a beginning to the kingdom of Britain, &amp; so <a id="l910"></a>may be recconed the three first kings, especially since the posterity <a id="l911"></a>of Constantine (viz<sup>t</sup> his sons Aurelius Ambrosius &amp; Vther Pendraco <a id="l912"></a>&amp; grandson Arthur) reigned afterwards. For from the time of the <a id="l913"></a>revolt of these Tyrants Britain continued  in a distinct king<a id="l914"></a>dom absolved from subjection to the Empire, the Emperor not being <a id="l915"></a>able to spare soldiers to be sent thither to recover &amp; keep the <a id="l916"></a>Island, &amp; therefore neglecting it; as we learn by unquestionable <a id="l917"></a>records. For Prosper tells us, A.C. 410 Variane Coss. Hac tempestate <a id="l918"></a>præ <a id="l919"></a>valetudine Romanorum vires funditus attenuatæ Britannorum <a id="l920"></a>vires attenuatæ, &amp; substrahunt se a  Romanorum domi<a id="l921"></a>natione. And Zosimus lib. 6: The transrhenane Barbarians invading <a id="l922"></a>all  places, reduc't the inhabitants of the island of Britain &amp; <a id="l923"></a>also certain Celtic nations to that pass that they fell off from the <a id="l924"></a>Roman Empire, &amp; being no longer obedient to the Roman laws κατ᾽ <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span> ἑαυτὸν βιατεύειν, <em class="underline">they lived in separate bodies after their own pleasure. <a id="l925"></a>Therefore the Britains taking up arms, &amp; hazzarding themselves for their <a id="l926"></a>own safety, they freed their cities from the imminent Barbarians. In <a id="l927"></a>like manner all  Brabant &amp; some other Provinces of the Galls imitating <a id="l928"></a>the Britains, freed themselves after the same manner, ejecting the <a id="l929"></a>Roman Presidents &amp; forming a certain Common wealth according to their <a id="l930"></a>own pleasure. This rebellion of Britain &amp; the Celtic nations happened <a id="l931"></a>when Constantine usurped the kingdom</em>. So also Procopius (lib. 1 Vand.) <a id="l932"></a>speaking of the same Constantine saith <em class="underline">Constantine being overcome <a id="l933"></a>in battel was slain with his children</em>: Βρηταννίαν μέν τοι Ρωμᾶῖοι <a id="l934"></a>ἀνασώσασθαι ὀυκέτι ἔχον ἀλλ᾽ ὀυσα ὐπὸ τυραννος ἀπ᾽ ἀυτοῦ ἔμενε: <a id="l935"></a><em class="underline">Yet the Romans could not recover Britain any more, but from that <a id="l936"></a>time it remained under Tyrants</em>. And Beda (l. 1. c. 11) <em class="underline">Fracta est <a id="l937"></a>Roma a Gothis anno 1164 suæ conditionis ex quo tempore Romani in <a id="l938"></a>Britannia regnare cessaverunt</em>. And Ethelwerdus: <em class="underline">A tempore Romæ <a id="l939"></a>a Gothis expugnatæ, cessavit imperium Romanorum a Britannia</em> <a id="l940"></a>insula, et ab alijs quas sub jugo servitutis tenebant multis terris. <a id="l941"></a>And Theodoret (Serm. 9 de Curand. Græc. affect.) about the year 424 <a id="l942"></a>reccons the Britains among the nations which were not then in <a id="l943"></a>subjection to the Roman Empire. And so Sigonius (ad annum 411) <a id="l944"></a><em class="underline">Imperium Romanorum post excessum Constantini in Brittania <a id="l945"></a>nullum fuit</em>.</p>
<p id="par68">Between the death of Constantine &amp; reign of Vortigern <a id="l946"></a>was an interregnum of about 14 years, in which the Britains <a id="l947"></a>had warrs with the Picts &amp; Scots, &amp; twice obteined the assistance <a id="l948"></a>of a Roman Legion, which drave out the enemy; but told them <a id="l949"></a>positively at their departure that they would come no more. Of <a id="l950"></a>Vortigerns beginning to reign there is this record in an old <a id="l951"></a>Chronicle in Nennius quoted by Cambden &amp; others. Guortigernus <a id="l952"></a>tenuit imperium in Britannia Theodosio et Valentiniano Coss. <a id="l953"></a>[viz<sup>t</sup> A.C. 425] &amp; in quarto anno regni sui Saxones ad Britanni<a id="l954"></a>am venerunt Fælice &amp; Tauro Coss [viz<sup>t</sup> A.C. 428.] This coming <a id="l955"></a>of the Saxons Sigebert referrs to the 4<sup>th</sup> year of Valentinian, <a id="l956"></a>which falls in with the year 428 assigned by this Chronicle: <a id="l957"></a>&amp; two years after, the Saxons together with the Picts were beaten <a id="l958"></a>by the Britains. Afterwards in the reign of Martian the Emperor, <a id="l959"></a>that is, between the years 450 &amp; 456, the Saxons under Hengist <a id="l960"></a>were called in by the Britains, but six years after revolted from <a id="l961"></a>them, &amp; made war upon them with various success, &amp; by degrees <a id="l962"></a>succeeded them. Yet the Britains continued  a flourishing <a id="l963"></a> Kingdom till the reign of Careticus, &amp; the war between <a id="l964"></a>the two nations a<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> continued till the reign of Pope Sergius A.C. 688.</p>
<p id="par69">8. The kings of the Hunns were A.C. 406 Octar &amp; Rugila, <a id="l965"></a>433 Bleda &amp; Attila. Octar &amp; Rugila were the brothers of Munzuc <a id="l966"></a>king of the Hunns in Gothia beyond the Danube, &amp; Bleda &amp; Attila <a id="l967"></a>were his sons &amp; Munzuc was the son of Balamir. The two first <a id="l968"></a>Iornandes tells us were kings of the Hunns but not of them all, <a id="l969"></a>&amp; had the two last for their successors. I date the reign of the <a id="l970"></a>Hunns in Pannonia from the time that the Vandals &amp; Alans re<a id="l971"></a>linquished Pannonia to them A.C. 406: Sigonius from the time that <a id="l972"></a>the Visigoths relinquished Pannonia  A.C. 408. <em class="underline">Constat</em>, saith <a id="l973"></a>he, <em class="underline">quod Gothis ex Illyrico profectis, Hunni successerunt, atque imprimis <a id="l974"></a>Pannoniam tenuerunt. Neque enim Honorius, viribus ad resis<a id="l975"></a>tendum in tantis difficultatibus destitutus, prorsus eos prohibere <a id="l976"></a>potuit, sed meliore consilio, animo ad pacem converso, fœdus <a id="l977"></a>cum eis, datis acceptisque obsidibus fecit, ex quibus qui dati sunt, Ætius, <a id="l978"></a>qui etiam Alarico tributus fuerat, præcipue memoratur</em>. How <a id="l979"></a>Ætius was hostage to the Goths &amp; Hunns is related by Frigeridus who <a id="l980"></a>when he had mentioned that Theodosius Emperor of the East had sent <a id="l981"></a>grievous commands to Iohn who after the death of Honorius had <a id="l982"></a>usurped the crown of the western Empire, he subjoyns. <em class="underline">Iis permotus Iohannes <a id="l983"></a>Ætium id temporis coram palatij gerentem cum ingenti auri pondere <a id="l984"></a>ad Chunnos transmisit notos sibi obsidiatûs sui tempore &amp; familiari <a id="l985"></a>amieitia devinctos</em> – And a little after: <em class="underline">Ætius tribus annis Alarici <a id="l986"></a>obses, dehinc Chunnorum, posthæc Carpilionis gener ex Comite domesticorum </em><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">et Iohannis Cura palatij</em>. Now Bucher shews that Ætius was hostage <a id="l987"></a>to Alaric till the year 410 when Alaric died, &amp; to the Hunns <a id="l988"></a>between the years 411 &amp; 415, &amp; son in law to Carpilio about <a id="l989"></a>the year 417 or 418, &amp; Curopalates to Iohn about the end of <a id="l990"></a>the year 423. Whence its probable that he became hostage to <a id="l991"></a>the Hunns about the year 412 or 413 when Honorius made <a id="l992"></a>leagues with almost all the barbarous nations &amp; granted them <a id="l993"></a>seats. But I had rather say with Sigonius that Ætius became <a id="l994"></a>hostage to Alaric A.C. 403. Its further manifest out of Prosper <a id="l995"></a>that the Hunns were in quiet possession of Pannonia in the <a id="l996"></a>year 432. For in the first Book of Eusebius's Chronicle Prosper <a id="l997"></a>writes: <em class="underline">Anno decimo post obitum Honorij cum ad Chunnorum <a id="l998"></a>gentem cui tunc Rugúla præerat, post prœlium cum Bonifacio <a id="l999"></a>se Ætius contulisset, impetrato auxilio ad Romanorum solúm <a id="l1000"></a>regreditur</em>. And in the second book: <em class="underline">Ætio &amp; Valerio Coss: Ætius <a id="l1001"></a>deposita potestate profugus ad Hunnos in Pannonia pervenit, <a id="l1002"></a>quorum  amicitia auxilioque usus pacem principum <a id="l1003"></a>interpellatæ potestatis obtinuit</em>. Hereby it  appears that at <a id="l1004"></a>this time Rugila (or, as Maximus calls him, Rechilla) reigned <a id="l1005"></a>over the Hunns in Pannonia; &amp; that Pannonia was not now <a id="l1006"></a>so much as accounted within the soile of the Empire, being <a id="l1007"></a>formerly granted away to the Hunns, &amp; that these were the <a id="l1008"></a>very same Hunns with which Ætius had, in the time of his <a id="l1009"></a>being an hostage, contracted friendship: by vertue of which <a id="l1010"></a>as he sollicited them before to the aid of Iohn the Tyrant <a id="l1011"></a>A.C. 424, so now he procured their intercession for him<a id="l1012"></a>self with the Emperor. Octar died A.C. 430, for Socrates <a id="l1013"></a>tells us that about that time the Burgundians having been <a id="l1014"></a>newly vext by the Hunns, upon intelligence of Octar's death, <a id="l1015"></a>seing them without a leader, set upon them suddenly with <a id="l1016"></a>so much success that 3000 Burgundians slew 10000 Hunns. <a id="l1017"></a>Of Rugila's being now king in Pannonia you have heard al<a id="l1018"></a>ready. He died A.C. 433, &amp; was succeeded by Bleda, as Prosper <a id="l1019"></a>&amp; Maximus inform us. This Bleda with his brother Attila <a id="l1020"></a>were before this time kings of the Hunns beyond the Da<a id="l1021"></a>nube, their father Munzuc's kingdom being divided between them, &amp; now they united the kingdom of Pannonia to their own. <a id="l1022"></a>When Paulus Diaconus saith they did <em class="underline">Regnum intra <a id="l1023"></a>Pannoniam Daciamque gerere</em>. In the year 441 they began <a id="l1024"></a>to invade the Empire a fresh, adding to the Pannonian forces <a id="l1025"></a>new &amp; great armies from Scythia. But this war was pre<a id="l1026"></a>sently composed. And then Attila seeing Bleda inclined to <a id="l1027"></a>peace slew him A.C. 444, inherited his dominions, &amp; invaded <a id="l1028"></a>the Empire afresh. At length after various great warrs with <a id="l1029"></a>the Romans, Attila perished A.C. 454, &amp; his sons quarrelling <a id="l1030"></a>about his dominions gave occasion to the Gepides, Ostrogoths, <a id="l1031"></a>&amp; other nations who were their subjects, to rebell &amp; make <a id="l1032"></a>war upon them. And the same year the Ostrogoths had <a id="l1033"></a>seats granted to them in Pannonia by the Emperors Marcian <a id="l1034"></a>&amp; Valentinian, &amp; with the Romans ejected the Hunns out <a id="l1035"></a>of Pannonia soon after the death of Attila, as all historians <a id="l1036"></a>agree. This ejection was in the reign of Avitus as is mentioned <a id="l1037"></a>in the Chronicum Boiorum &amp; in Sidonius Carm. 7 in Avitum which speaks <a id="l1038"></a>thus of that Emperor</p>
<div class="lg"><p>– <em class="underline">Cujus solum amissas post sæcula multa</em></p>
<p class="l"><em class="underline">Pannonias revocavit iter, jam credere promptum est</em></p>
<p class="l"><em class="underline">Quid faciet bellis</em>.</p></div>
<p id="par70" class="i0">The Poet means that by the coming of Avitus the Hunns yeilded more <a id="l1039"></a>easily to the Goths. This was written by Sidonius in the beginning <a id="l1040"></a>of the reign of Avitus. And his reign began in the end of the <a id="l1041"></a>year 455, &amp; lasted not one full year.</p>
<p id="par71">Iornandes tells us: <em class="underline">Duodecimo anno regni Waliæ post pene </em><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021r"> &lt;21r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">quinquaginta annos invasa Pannonia, Hunni a Romanis &amp; Gothis pulsi <a id="l1042"></a>sunt</em>. And Marcelline: <em class="underline">Hierio et Ardaburio Coss. Pannoniæ quæ per <a id="l1043"></a>quinquaginta annos ab Hunnis retinebantur, a Romanis receptæ sunt</em>. Whence <a id="l1044"></a>it should seem that the Hunns invaded &amp; held Pannonia from the year <a id="l1045"></a>378 or 379 to the year 427, &amp; then were driven out of it. But this <a id="l1046"></a>is a plane mistake. For it is certain that the Emperor Theodosius <a id="l1047"></a>left the Empire entire. And we have shewed out of Prosper that <a id="l1048"></a>the Hunns were in quiet possession of Pannonia in the year 432. <a id="l1049"></a>The Visigoths in those days had nothing to do with Pannonia, &amp; the <a id="l1050"></a>Ostrogoths continued subject to the Hunns till the death of Attalus <a id="l1051"></a>A.C. 454, &amp; Wallia king of the Visigoths did not reign twelve years. <a id="l1052"></a>He began his reign in the end of the year 415, reigned three years <a id="l1053"></a>&amp; was slain A.C. 419, as Idacius, Isidorus &amp; the Spanish manuscript <a id="l1054"></a>Chronicles seem by Grotius, testify. And Olympiodorus, who produces <a id="l1055"></a>his history only to the year 425, sets down therein the death of Valia <a id="l1056"></a>king of the Visigoths, &amp; conjoyns it with that of Constantius which <a id="l1057"></a>happened A.C. 420. Wherefore the Valia of Iornandes who reigned <a id="l1058"></a>at least twelve years, is some other king. And I suspect that this <a id="l1059"></a>name has been put by mistake for Valamir king of the Ostrogoths. <a id="l1060"></a>For the action recorded was of the Romans &amp; Ostrogoths driving <a id="l1061"></a>the Hunns out of Pannonia after the death of Attila. And it is <a id="l1062"></a>not likely that the historian would  referr the history of the Ostro<a id="l1063"></a>goths to the years of the Visigothic kings. This action happened in <a id="l1064"></a>the end of the year 455, which I take to be the twelft year of Vala<a id="l1065"></a>mir in Pannonia, and which was almost fifty years after the year <a id="l1066"></a>406 in which the Hunns succeeded the Vandals &amp; Alans in Pannonia. <a id="l1067"></a>Vpon the ceasing of the line of Hunnimund the son of Herma<a id="l1068"></a>neric, the Ostrogoths lived without kings of their own nation <a id="l1069"></a>about 40 years together, being subject to the Hunns. And when <a id="l1070"></a>Alaric began to make war upon the Romans, which was in the <a id="l1071"></a>year 444, he made Valamir with his brothers Theodemir &amp; <a id="l1072"></a>Videmer the grandsons of Vinithar, captains or Kings of these <a id="l1073"></a>Ostrogoths under him. And in the twelft year of Valamir's reign <a id="l1074"></a>dated from thence the Hunns were driven out of Pannonia.</p>
<p id="par72">Yet the Hunns were not so ejected but that they had <a id="l1075"></a>further contests with the Romans will the head of Denfix the <a id="l1076"></a>son of Attila, A.C. 468 (in the Consulship of Zeno &amp; Marcian <a id="l1077"></a>as Marcelline relates) was carried to Constantinople. Nor were <a id="l1078"></a>they yet totaly ejected the Empire. For besides their reliques <a id="l1079"></a>in Pannonia, Sigonius tells us that when the Emperors Marcian <a id="l1080"></a>&amp; Valentinian granted Pannonia to the Goths (which was in the <a id="l1081"></a>year 454) they granted some part of Illyricum to some of the <a id="l1082"></a>Hunns &amp; Sarmatans. And in the year 526, when the Lombards <a id="l1083"></a>removing into Pannonia made war there upon the Gepides, the <a id="l1084"></a>Avares (a part of the Hunns who had now taken the name of <a id="l1085"></a>Avares from one of their kings) assisted the Lombards in that <a id="l1086"></a>war, &amp; the Lombards afterwards, when they went into Italy, <a id="l1087"></a>left their seats in Pannonia to the Avares in recompence of <a id="l1088"></a>their friendship. And from that time the Hunns grew again <a id="l1089"></a>very powerfull, their kings (whom they called Chagan) troubling <a id="l1090"></a>the Empire very much in the reigns of the Emperors Mauritius, <a id="l1091"></a>Phocas &amp; Heraclius. And this is the original of the present <a id="l1092"></a>kingdom of Hungary, which from these Avares &amp; other Hunns <a id="l1093"></a>mixed together took the name of Hun-Avaria, &amp; by contraction <a id="l1094"></a>Hungary.</p>
<p id="par73">9. The Lombards before they came over the Danube were <a id="l1095"></a>commanded by two Captains Ibor &amp; Ayon: after whose death <a id="l1096"></a>they had Kings, Agilmundus, Lamisso, Lechu, Hildehoc, Gudehoc, <a id="l1097"></a>Claffo, Tato, Wacho, Walter, Audoin, Alboin, Cleophis, &amp;c. <a id="l1098"></a>Agilmundus was the son of Ayon &amp; became their king (according <a id="l1099"></a>to Prosper) in the Consulship of Honorius &amp; Theodosius A.C. 389, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022r"> &lt;22r&gt; </span> and reigned 33 years according to Paulus Warnefridus &amp; was <a id="l1100"></a>slain in battel by the Bulgars. Prosper places his death in the <a id="l1101"></a>Consulship of Marinianus &amp; Asclepiadorus A.C. 423. Lamisso <a id="l1102"></a>routed the Bulgars &amp; reigned three years &amp; Lechu almost <a id="l1103"></a>forty. Gudehoc was contemporary to Odoacer king of the He<a id="l1104"></a>ruli in Italy &amp; led his people from Pannonia into Rugia a <a id="l1105"></a>country on the north side of Noricum next beyond the Danube, <a id="l1106"></a>from whence Odoacer then carried his people into Italy. Tato <a id="l1107"></a>overthrew the kingdom of the Heruli beyond the Danube &amp; <a id="l1108"></a>Wacho conquered the Suevians a kingdom then bounded <a id="l1109"></a>on the east by Bavaria, on the west by France &amp; on the <a id="l1110"></a>south by the Burgundians. Audoin returned into Pannonia <a id="l1111"></a>A.C. 526, &amp; there overcame the Gepides. Alboin A.C. 551 <a id="l1112"></a>overthrew the kingdom of the Gepides &amp; slew their king <a id="l1113"></a>Chunnimundus, &amp; A.C. 563 assisted the Greek Emperor <a id="l1114"></a>against Totila king of the Ostrogoths in Italy, &amp; A.C. 568 <a id="l1115"></a>led his people out of Pannonia into Lombardy where they <a id="l1116"></a>reigned till the year 774.</p>
<p id="par74">According to Paulus Diaconus the Lombards with many <a id="l1117"></a>other Gothic nations came into the Empire from beyond the <a id="l1118"></a>Danube in the reign of Honorius &amp; Arcadius, that is between <a id="l1119"></a>the years 395 &amp; 408. But they might come in a little earlier. <a id="l1120"></a>For we are told that the Lombards under their captains Ibor <a id="l1121"></a>&amp; Ayon beat the Vandals in battel, &amp; Prosper places this vic<a id="l1122"></a>tory in the Consulship of Ausonius &amp; Olybrius, that is, A.C. 379. <a id="l1123"></a>Before this war the Vandals had remained quiet forty years <a id="l1124"></a>in their seats granted to them in Pannonia by Constantine the <a id="l1125"></a>great. And therefore if these were the same Vandals, this war <a id="l1126"></a>was in Pannonia &amp; might be occasioned by the coming of the <a id="l1127"></a>Lombards over the Danube into Pannonia a year or two before <a id="l1128"></a>the battel, &amp; put an end to that quiet which had lasted 40 years. <a id="l1129"></a>And after Gratian &amp; Theodosius had quieted the barbarians, they <a id="l1130"></a>might either retire over the Danube or continue quiet under the <a id="l1131"></a>Romans till after the death of Theodosius, &amp; then either invade <a id="l1132"></a>the Empire anew of throw off all subjection to it. By their <a id="l1133"></a>warrs first with the Vandals &amp; then with the Bulgars, a Scythian <a id="l1134"></a>nation so called from the river Volga from whence they came; <a id="l1135"></a>it appears that even in those days they were a kingdom not contemptible.</p>
<p id="par75">10 These  nine kingdoms being rent away we are next to <a id="l1136"></a>consider the residue of the western Empire. While this Empire <a id="l1137"></a> continued entire it was the Beast himself: but the residue <a id="l1138"></a>thereof is but a part of him. And if this part be considered as a <a id="l1139"></a>horn, the reign of this horn may be dated from the translation <a id="l1140"></a>of the Imperial seat from Rome to Ravenna, which was in October <a id="l1141"></a>A.C. 408. For then the Emperor Honorius fearing that Alaric <a id="l1142"></a>would beseige him in Rome if he staid there, retired to Millain <a id="l1143"></a>&amp; thence to Ravenna: &amp; the ensuing siege &amp; sacking of Rome <a id="l1144"></a>confirmed his residence there, so that he &amp; his successors <a id="l1145"></a>ever after made it their home. And accordingly Machiavel <a id="l1146"></a>in his Florentine history writes that Valentinian having left <a id="l1147"></a>Rome translated the seat of the Empire to Ravenna.</p>
<p id="par76">Rhætia belonged to the western Emperors so long as that <a id="l1148"></a>Empire stood, &amp; then it descended with Italy &amp; the Roman Senate <a id="l1149"></a>to Odoacer king of the Heruli in Italy, &amp; after him to Theo<a id="l1150"></a>deric king of the Ostrogoths &amp; his successors by the grant of the <a id="l1151"></a>Greek Emperors. Vpon the death of Valentinian the second, the <a id="l1152"></a>Alemans &amp; Suevians invaded Rhætia A.C. 455. But I do not <a id="l1153"></a>find that they erected any standing kingdom there. For in the <a id="l1154"></a>year 457, while they were yet depopulating Rhætia, they <a id="l1155"></a>were attaqued &amp; beaten by Burto the Master of the horse to the <a id="l1156"></a>Emperor Majoranus, &amp; I hear nothing more of their invading <a id="l1157"></a>Rhætia. Clodovæus king of France in or about the year <a id="l1158"></a>496 conquered a kingdom of the Alemans &amp; Suevians &amp; slew <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023r"> &lt;23r&gt; </span> their last king Ermeric. But this kingdom was seated in Germany <a id="l1159"></a>&amp; only bordered upon Rhætia. For its people fled from Clodovœus <a id="l1160"></a>into the neighbouring kingdom of the Ostrogoths under Theoderic. <a id="l1161"></a>And Theoderic received them as friends, &amp; wrote a friendly Letter <a id="l1162"></a>to Clodovæus in their behalf. And by this means they became in<a id="l1163"></a>habitants of Rhætia as subjects under the dominion of the <a id="l1164"></a>Ostrogoths.</p>
<p id="par77">When the Greek Emperor conquered the Ostrogoths he <a id="l1165"></a>succeeded them in the kingdom of Ravenna not only by right <a id="l1166"></a>of conquest but also by right of inheritance, the Roman <a id="l1167"></a>Senate still going along with this kingdome. And therefore we <a id="l1168"></a>may reccon that this kingdome continued in the Exarchate of <a id="l1169"></a>Ravenna &amp; Senate of Rome. For the Remainder of the <a id="l1170"></a>Western Empire went along with the Senate of Rome, by reason <a id="l1171"></a>of the right which this Senate still retained &amp; at length exerted,<a id="l1172"></a> of chusing a new western Emperor.</p>
<p id="par78">I have now enumerated the kingdoms into which the <a id="l1173"></a>Western Empire became divided at its first breaking. Some of <a id="l1174"></a>these at length fell &amp; new ones arose: but whatever was <a id="l1175"></a>their number afterwards; they are still called the ten kings <a id="l1176"></a> from their first number.</p>

Kings are put for kingdoms as above, &amp; therefore the <a id="l1191"></a>little horn is a little kingdom. It was a horn of the  <a id="l1192"></a>fourth Beast &amp; rooted up three of the first horns, &amp; therefore <a id="l1193"></a>we are to look for it among the nations of the Latine Empire <a id="l1194"></a>after the rise of the ten horns. But it was a kingdom of a different <a id="l1195"></a>kind from the other ten kingdoms, having a life or soul peculiar <a id="l1196"></a>to it self with eyes &amp; a mouth. But its eyes it was a seer, &amp; by <a id="l1197"></a>its mouth speaking great things &amp; changing times &amp; laws it was <a id="l1198"></a>a Prophet as well as a King.

The Donation of Constantine <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027r"> &lt;27r&gt; </span> the great is a fiction, &amp; so is the donation of the Alpes Cottiæ  to the <a id="l1225"></a>Pope by Aripert king of the Lombards.

<p id="par84">The invocation of the dead &amp; veneration of their Images being <a id="l1228"></a>gradually introduced in the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>t</sup>, &amp; 7<sup>th</sup> Centuries, the <a id="l1229"></a>Greek Emperor Philippicus declared against the latter A.C. <a id="l1230"></a>711 or 712. And the Emperor Leo Isaurus to put a stop to it <a id="l1231"></a>called a meeting of Councellours &amp; Bishops in his Palace <a id="l1232"></a>A.C. 726,<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> &amp; by their advice put out an Edict against that <a id="l1233"></a>worship, &amp; wrote to Pope Gregory the second that a general <a id="l1234"></a>Council might by called.

And the people of Rome, Campania, <a id="l1239"></a>Ravenna &amp; Pentapolis, with the cities under them, revolted <a id="l1240"></a>&amp; laid violent hands upon their Magistrates killing the <a id="l1241"></a>Exarch Paul at Ravenna, &amp; laying aside Peter Duke of <a id="l1242"></a>Rome who was become blind.

<p id="par85"><sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup>At that time the Lombards also being zealous for the <a id="l1257"></a>worship of Images, &amp; pretending to favour the cause of the Pope, <a id="l1258"></a>invaded the cities of the Exarchate: &amp; at length (viz<sup>t</sup> A.C. 752) <a id="l1259"></a>they took Ravenna &amp; put an end to the Exarchate.

<p id="par86"><sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup>In the year 751 Pope Zechary deposed Childeric a sloathful <a id="l1261"></a>&amp; useless king of France, &amp; the last of the race of Merovæus, &amp; <a id="l1262"></a>absolving his subjects from their oath of allegiance, gave the <a id="l1263"></a>kingdom to Pipin the Maior of the Palace, &amp; thereby made a <a id="l1264"></a>new &amp; potent friend.<sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup> And his successor Pope Stephen III, knowing <a id="l1265"></a>better how to deal with the Greek Emperor then with the Lombards, <a id="l1266"></a>went the next year to the king of the Lombards to persuade <a id="l1267"></a>him to return the Exarchate to the Emperor. But this not <a id="l1268"></a>succeeding, he went into France &amp; persuaded Pipin to take <a id="l1269"></a>the Exarchate &amp; Pentapolis from the Lombards &amp; give it to <a id="l1270"></a>Saint Peter. And accordingly Pipin A.C. 754 came with an army <a id="l1271"></a>into Italy, &amp; made Aistulphus king of the Lombards promise <a id="l1272"></a>the surrender. But the next year Aistulphus on the contrary, <a id="l1273"></a>to revenge himself on the Pope, beseiged the city of Rome. <a id="l1274"></a>Whereupon the Pope sent Letters to Pipin, wherein he told him <a id="l1275"></a>that if he came not speedily against the Lombards, <em class="underline">pro data <a id="l1276"></a>sibi potentiam alienandum fore a regno Dei et vita æterna</em>, <a id="l1277"></a>he should be excommunicated. Pipin therefore fearing a revolt <a id="l1278"></a>of his new subjects, &amp; being indebted to the Church of Rome, came <a id="l1279"></a>speedily with an army into Italy, raised the seige, beseiged the <a id="l1280"></a>Lombards in Papia &amp; forced them to surrender the Exarchate &amp; 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p028r"> &lt;28r&gt; </span> region of Pentapolis to the Pope for a perpetual possession. Thus <a id="l1281"></a>the Pope became Lord of Ravenna &amp; the Exarchate, some <a id="l1282"></a>few cities excepted; &amp; the Keys were sent to Rome, &amp; laid <a id="l1283"></a>upon the Confession of Saint Peter, that is, upon his Tomb at the High <a id="l1284"></a>Altar, <em class="underline">in signum veri perpetuique dominij, sed pietate Regis gra<a id="l1285"></a>tuita</em>, as the inscription of a coin of Pipin hath it.

And henceforward the Popes being tem<a id="l1287"></a>poral Princes left off in their Epistles &amp; Bulls to note the years <a id="l1288"></a>of the Greek Emperors as they had hitherto done.</p>
<p id="par87"><sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup>After this the Lombards invading the Popes countries, Pope <a id="l1289"></a>Adrian sent to Charles the great the son &amp; successor of Pipin to <a id="l1290"></a>come to his assistance. And accordingly Charles entred Italy with <a id="l1291"></a>an army, invaded the Lombards, overthrew their kingdom, became <a id="l1292"></a>master of their countries, &amp; restored to the Pope, not only what they <a id="l1293"></a>had taken from him, but also the rest of the Exarchate which they <a id="l1294"></a>had promised Pipin to surrender to him but had hitherto  <a id="l1295"></a>detained, &amp; also gave him some cities of the Lombards, &amp; was mutually <a id="l1296"></a>made Patricius by the Romans, &amp; had the authority of confirming <a id="l1297"></a>the elections of the Popes conferred upon him. These things were <a id="l1298"></a>done in the year 773 &amp; 774. And this was the second kingdom <a id="l1299"></a>which fell before the little horn. But Rome which was to be <a id="l1300"></a>the seat of his kingdom, was not yet his own.</p>
<p id="par88"><sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup>In the year 796 Leo III being made Pope, notified his <a id="l1301"></a>election to Charles the great by his Legates, sending to him for a <a id="l1302"></a>present, the golden keys of the Confession of Peter, &amp; the Banner <a id="l1303"></a>of the city of Rome: the first as an acknowledgement of the <a id="l1304"></a>Popes holding the cities of the exarchate &amp; Lombards by the <a id="l1305"></a>grant of Charles; the other as a signification that Charles <a id="l1306"></a>should come &amp; subdue the Senate &amp; people of Rome, as he <a id="l1307"></a>had done the Exarchate &amp; the kingdome of the Lombards. <a id="l1308"></a>For the Pope at the same time desired Charles to send some of <a id="l1309"></a>his Princes to Rome who might subject the Roman people to <a id="l1310"></a>him &amp; bind them by oath <em class="underline">in fide &amp; subjectione</em>, in fealty &amp; <a id="l1311"></a>subjection, as his words are recited by Sigonius. An anonymous <a id="l1312"></a>Poet published by Boeclerus at Strasburgh, expresses it thus.</p>
<div class="lg"><p class="l">Admonuitque pijs precibus, qui mittere vellet</p>

<p class="l">Subdere Romanam, servandaque fœdera cogens</p>
<p class="l">Hanc fidei sacramentis promittere magnis.</p></div>
<p id="par89">Hence arose a misunderstanding between the Pope &amp; the <a id="l1313"></a>city. And the Romans about two or three years after, by assistance <a id="l1314"></a>of some of the Clergy, raised so great tumults against him <a id="l1315"></a>as gave occasion to a new state of things in all the west. <a id="l1316"></a>For two of the Clergy accused him of certain crimes, &amp; by <a id="l1317"></a>an armed force of the Romans seized him stript him of his <a id="l1318"></a>sacerdotal habit &amp; imprisoned him in a Monastery. But by <a id="l1319"></a>assistance of his friends he made his escape &amp; fled into Ger<a id="l1320"></a>many to Charles the great, &amp; complained of the Romans for <a id="l1321"></a>acting against him out of a designe of throwing off all autho<a id="l1322"></a>rity of the Church &amp; recovering their ancient freedome. <a id="l1323"></a>And in his absence his accusers with an armed force ravaged <a id="l1324"></a>the possessions of the Church &amp; send the accusations to Charles. And before <a id="l1325"></a>the end of the year Charles sent the Pope back to Rome with <a id="l1326"></a>a large retinue. And the Nobles &amp; Bishops of France who <a id="l1327"></a>accompanied him examined the chief of his accusers at <a id="l1328"></a>Rome &amp; sent them into France in custody. This was in the <a id="l1329"></a>year 799. And the next year Charles himself went to <a id="l1330"></a>Rome, &amp; upon a day appointed presided in a Council of <a id="l1331"></a>Italian &amp; French Bishops to hear both parties. But when <a id="l1332"></a>the Popes adversaries expected to be heard, the Council <a id="l1333"></a>declared<sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup> that he who was the supreme Iudge of all men, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p029r"> &lt;29r&gt; </span> was above being judged by any other then himself. And <a id="l1334"></a>thereupon the Pope made a solemn declaration of his <a id="l1335"></a>innocence before all the people, &amp; by doing so was looked <a id="l1336"></a>upon as acquitted.</p>
<p id="par90">A few days after when Christmas day was arrived, the <a id="l1337"></a>people of Rome who had hitherto elected their Bishop &amp; <a id="l1338"></a>recconed that they &amp; their Senate inherited the rights of the <a id="l1339"></a>ancient Senate &amp; people of Rome, voted Charles their Emperor <a id="l1340"></a>&amp; subjected themselves unto him in such manner as the old <a id="l1341"></a>Roman Empire &amp; their Senate were subject to the old Ro<a id="l1342"></a>man Emperors. And the Pope crowned him, &amp; annointed him <a id="l1343"></a>with holy oyle, &amp; worshipped him on his knees after the <a id="l1344"></a>manner of adoring the old Roman Emperors, as the aforesaid <a id="l1345"></a>Poet thus mentions.</p>
<div class="lg"><p class="l"><em class="underline">Post laudes igitur dictus et summus eundem</em></p>
<p class="l"><em class="underline">Præsul adoravit, sicut mos debitus olim</em></p>
<p class="l"><em class="underline">Principibus fuit antiquis</em>.</p></div>
<p id="par91" class="i0">And the Emperor mutually took the following oath to the Pope <a id="l1346"></a><em class="underline">In nomine Christi spondeo atque polliceor Ego Carolus Impe<a id="l1347"></a>rator coram Deo et beato Petro Apostolo me protectorem <a id="l1348"></a>ac defensorem fore hujus Sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ in omnibus <a id="l1349"></a>utilitatibus quatenus divino fultus fuero adjutorio prout <a id="l1350"></a>sciero poteroque</em>. The Emperor was also made Consul of <a id="l1351"></a>Rome &amp; his son Pipin was crowned King of Italy. And hence<a id="l1352"></a>forward the Emperor stiled himself: <em class="underline">Carolus serenissimus <a id="l1353"></a>Augustus, a Deo coronatus, magnus, pacificus, Romæ gubernans <a id="l1354"></a>Imperium</em>, or Imperator Romanorum; &amp; was prayed for in <a id="l1355"></a>the Churches of Rome; &amp; his image was henceforward <a id="l1356"></a>put upon the coins of Rome: &amp; the enemies of the Pope to <a id="l1357"></a>the number of three hundred Romans,  &amp; two or three of the Clergy, were sentenced to <a id="l1359"></a>death, &amp; the 300 Romans were beheaded in one day in the <a id="l1360"></a>Lateran fields, but the Clergy men at the intercession of <a id="l1361"></a>the Pope were pardoned &amp; banished into France. And thus <a id="l1362"></a>the right of Roman Emperors which had hitherto been in the <a id="l1363"></a>Greek Emperors was by this Act transferred in the west to the <a id="l1364"></a>Kings of France.</p>
<p id="par92"><sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup>After these things Charles gave the city &amp; Dutchy of Rome to the Pope subordinately to himself as Emperor of the Romans;  spent the winter in ordering the affairs of Rome <a id="l1365"></a>&amp; those of the Apostolick sea &amp; of all Italy both civil &amp; <a id="l1366"></a>ecclesiastical &amp; in making new laws for them; &amp; returned <a id="l1367"></a>the next summer into France; leaving the City under <a id="l1368"></a>its Senate &amp; both under the Pope &amp; himself. And hearing <a id="l1369"></a>that his new laws were not observed by the Iudges in dictating <a id="l1370"></a>the law, nor by the people in hearing it; &amp; that the great <a id="l1371"></a>men took servants from free men, &amp; from the Churches &amp; <a id="l1372"></a>Monasteries, to labour in their vineyards, fields, pastures &amp; <a id="l1373"></a>houses, &amp; continued to exact cattel &amp; wine of them, &amp; to <a id="l1374"></a>oppress those that served the Churches: he wrote to his son <a id="l1375"></a>Pipin to remedy these abuses, take care of the church, &amp; <a id="l1376"></a>see that his laws be executed.</p>
<p id="par93">Now the Senate &amp; people &amp; Principality of Rome I take <a id="l1377"></a>to be the third King whom the little horn overcame &amp; even <a id="l1378"></a>the chief of the three. For this people elected the Pope &amp; the <a id="l1379"></a>Emperor, &amp; by Electing the Emperor &amp; making him Consul <a id="l1380"></a>was acknowledged to retain the authority of the old Roman <a id="l1381"></a>Senate &amp; people. This city was the Metropolis of the old Roman <a id="l1382"></a>Empire represented in Daniel by the fourth Beast, &amp; by subduing <a id="l1383"></a>the Senate &amp; people &amp; Dutchy it became the Metropolis of the little <a id="l1384"></a>horn of that Beast, &amp; completed Peter's Patrimony which was <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030r"> &lt;30r&gt; </span> the kingdom of that horn. And this victory was attended with <a id="l1385"></a>greater consequences then those over the other two kings. <a id="l1386"></a>For it set up the western Empire which continues to this day. <a id="l1387"></a>It set up the Pope above the judicature of the Roman Senate <a id="l1388"></a>&amp; Council of Italy &amp; even above all humane judicature, &amp; gave <a id="l1389"></a>him the supremacy over the western Churches &amp; their Councils <a id="l1390"></a>in a high degree. It gave him a look more stout then his fellows <a id="l1391"></a>so that at length when this new religion began to be established <a id="l1392"></a>in the minds of men, he grappled not only with kings, but even <a id="l1393"></a>with the western Emperor himself. It is observable also that <a id="l1394"></a>the custome of kissing the Popes feet, an honour superior to that <a id="l1395"></a>of kings &amp; Emperors, began about this time. There are some <a id="l1396"></a>instances of it in the ninth Century. Platina tells us that <a id="l1397"></a>the feet of Pope Leo IV were kissed according to ancient custome <a id="l1398"></a>by all that came to him, &amp; some say that Leo III began this <a id="l1399"></a>custome, pretending that his hand was infected by the kiss of a <a id="l1400"></a>woman. The Popes began also about this time to canonize <a id="l1401"></a>Saints &amp; grant Indulgences &amp; Pardons: &amp; some represent that <a id="l1402"></a>Leo III was the first author of all these things. And it is <a id="l1403"></a>further observable that Charles the great between the years <a id="l1404"></a>775 &amp; 796 conquered all Germany  from the <a id="l1405"></a>Rhene &amp; Danube  northward to the Baltic sea &amp; eastward <a id="l1406"></a>to the river Teys, &amp; extended his conquests also into Spain as far <a id="l1407"></a>as to the river  Eber, &amp; by these conquests he laid the <a id="l1408"></a>foundation of the new Empire; &amp; at the same time he propa<a id="l1409"></a>gated the Roman Catholick religion into all his conquests, obliging <a id="l1410"></a>the Saxons &amp; Hunns who were heathens, to receive the Roman <a id="l1411"></a>faith, &amp; distributing his northern conquests into Bishopricks, &amp; <a id="l1412"></a>granting tyths to the Clergy &amp; Peterpence to the Pope: by all <a id="l1413"></a>which the Church of Rome was highly enlarged enriched <a id="l1414"></a>exalted &amp; established.</p>
<p id="par94">In a small book printed at Paris 1689, &amp; entituled: <sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> <em class="underline">An <a id="l1415"></a>historical dissertation upon some coins of Charles the great, <a id="l1416"></a>Ludovicus Pius, Lotharius &amp; their successors stamped at Rome</em> <a id="l1417"></a>there is a draught of a piece of Mosaic work which Pope <a id="l1418"></a>Leo III caused to be made in his Palace neare the Church of <a id="l1419"></a>Iohn Lateran, in memory of his sending the standard or banner <a id="l1420"></a>of the city of Rome curiously wrought, to Charles the great, &amp; <a id="l1421"></a>which still remained there at the publishing of the said <a id="l1422"></a>Book.

<p id="par95">After the death of Charles the great, his son &amp; successor <a id="l1448"></a>Ludovicus Pius, at the request of the Pope <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> confirmed the donations <a id="l1449"></a>of his Grandfather &amp; Father to the sea of Rome.

And as the king <a id="l1459"></a>of the Ostrogoths for acknowledging that he held his kingdom <a id="l1460"></a>of Italy of the Greek Emperor, stamped the effigies of the <a id="l1461"></a>Emperor on one side of his coins &amp; his own on the Reverse: <a id="l1462"></a>so the Pope made the like acknowledgement to the western <a id="l1463"></a>Emperor. For the Pope began now to coin money, &amp; the <a id="l1464"></a>coins of Rome are henceforward found with the head of <a id="l1465"></a>the Emperors (Charles, Ludovicus Pius, Lotharius, &amp; their <a id="l1466"></a>successors) on the one side, &amp; the Popes inscription on the <a id="l1467"></a>reverse for many years.</p>

<h2 id="hd8" class="cent">Chap. III. <a id="l1468"></a><br> Of the eleventh Kingdom  signified by <a id="l1469"></a>the little horn which arose after the tenn.</h2>
<p id="par96">The little horn agrees in all things with the woman upon <a id="l1470"></a>Iohn's beast. It had eyes &amp; a mouth &amp;  therefore was a different <a id="l1471"></a>animal from the Beast &amp; had a different soul &amp; so had the <a id="l1472"></a>woman. It is called a King divers from the ten, has a look <a id="l1473"></a>more stout then they, &amp; has such dominion over the people <a id="l1474"></a>of the Beast as to change times &amp; laws: &amp; so the woman <a id="l1475"></a>is deckt in royall apparel &amp; sitts on the beast, that is, reigns <a id="l1476"></a>over him. &amp; is called a Queen &amp;  the great <a id="l1477"></a>city Babylon which reigns over the Kings of the earth. The little <a id="l1478"></a>horn rises after the ten &amp; so the womans reign begins after <a id="l1479"></a>theirs. For the Beast first rises with his horns crowned without <a id="l1480"></a>the woman &amp; then appears with the woman upon his back. <a id="l1481"></a> The little horn to <a id="l1488"></a>denote him a Seer &amp; a Prophet has eyes &amp; a mouth &amp; <a id="l1489"></a>speaks great things against the most high: &amp; the woman is <a id="l1490"></a>called the Prophetess Iezabel &amp;  teaches to commit <a id="l1491"></a>spiritual fornication, that is in the language of the Prophets to blaspheme <a id="l1492"></a>or speak against God. The little horn wears out the saints <a id="l1493"></a>&amp; has times &amp; laws given into his hand to change them &amp; the <a id="l1494"></a> woman is drunken with the blood of saints &amp; <a id="l1495"></a>deceives all nations by her sorceries &amp; corrupts the earth with <a id="l1496"></a>her  fornication. The horn reigns a time times &amp; half a <a id="l1497"></a>time &amp; so does the woman  For after she has  deserted the remnant of <a id="l1498"></a>her seed who keep the commandments of God  &amp; is arrived to her place in the wilderness they <a id="l1499"></a> feed her there   a time &amp; times &amp; half <a id="l1500"></a>a time, that is  after she is arrived to her <a id="l1502"></a>dignity of  Queen in the wilderness the merchants of the earth enrich <a id="l1503"></a>her so long, &amp; therefore her Beast  is said in speaking great <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025v"> &lt;25v&gt; </span> things &amp; blasphemies to act or continue 42 months,  suppose in conjuncti<a id="l1504"></a>on with the woman.  The horn &amp; woman agree in all things &amp; there <a id="l1507"></a>is nothing else in Daniel which answers to the woman nor in <a id="l1508"></a>Iohn which answers to the horn. This horn therefore being <a id="l1509"></a> the woman must reign in the seven hilled City <a id="l1510"></a>Rome &amp; by consequence be the Popedome. The Popedome <a id="l1511"></a>has a territory with a standing army &amp; so is truly a horn &amp; <a id="l1512"></a>it is not likely that Daniel in describing all the horns of <a id="l1513"></a>the Beast would omit this which is more considerable then all <a id="l1514"></a>the rest tho but a little one. Tis a dominion both temporal <a id="l1515"></a>&amp;  ecclesiastical, that is both masculine &amp; feminine &amp; so is fitly <a id="l1516"></a>recconned by Daniel a King &amp; by Iohn a Queen. Its tem<a id="l1517"></a>poral dominion is but small &amp; therefore tis but a little <a id="l1518"></a>horn: its ecclesiastical is universal &amp; therefore as a Queen <a id="l1519"></a>it reigns over the whole Beast. As a woman or church <a id="l1520"></a>it has continued from the beginning being at first pure <a id="l1521"></a>&amp; afterwards corrupt: as a horn or temporal kingdom it rose up <a id="l1522"></a>after the ten horns. Tis of a different kind from all the <a id="l1523"></a>rest &amp; in all the  western Empire there is no other  <a id="l1524"></a> little Kingdom of any note of a different kind from <a id="l1525"></a>the rest. It spake great things against the most High &amp;  had times &amp; laws given into its hand during all <a id="l1527"></a>its reign to change them &amp; so great an authority in matters of religion is assumd <a id="l1528"></a>only by the Pope. It  ware out the saints of the most High <a id="l1529"></a>&amp; the Papacy is the grand author of persecuting to death all <a id="l1530"></a>in all kingdoms of  a different religion from himself.  Tho it was <a id="l1531"></a>but a little horn the least of the eleven yet its look was more stout then <a id="l1532"></a>it's fellows: &amp; such is that of the Papacy. It was to reign <a id="l1533"></a>a long time even 1260 years &amp; the Papacy had  already continued <a id="l1534"></a>a  horn above 900 of those years. In its rise it was to <a id="l1535"></a>root up  three of the former horns &amp; so did the Papacy <a id="l1536"></a>which is a very signal character.  The history <a id="l1537"></a>thereof is as follows.</p>
<p id="par97">In the year 607 the Pope by the grant of the Emperor <a id="l1538"></a>Phocas became universal Bishop, but  had  neither  temporal dominion nor military power &amp; so was not <a id="l1540"></a>yet a horn in the sense of Daniel.  For this horn arose  by the ruin of other which were temporal.. Pictures &amp; Images began before this time to <a id="l1541"></a>be set up in the Churches but their worship was not yet <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span> decreed. At length the Greek Emperor Philippicus a Mono<a id="l1542"></a>thelite  A.C. 712 caused the  <a id="l1543"></a>picture of the  sixt general Council called against the <a id="l1544"></a>Monothelites to be abolished. And thereupon Pope Con<a id="l1545"></a>stantine  calling a Synod at Rome  anathematized the Emperor, forbad the setting up of <a id="l1547"></a>his Images, set up in Saint Peters Church the picture <a id="l1548"></a>of the six general Councils, &amp; (as Sigonius relates added another decree wherby <a id="l1549"></a> <em class="underline">omnes qui sanctis imaginibus venerationem con<a id="l1550"></a>stitutam ab Ecclesia denegarent damnati sunt</em>,  <a id="l1551"></a>all  who  denied to the holy Images the venera<a id="l1552"></a>tion which was  appointed to them by the Church <a id="l1553"></a> are damned. This was the first decree for the <a id="l1554"></a>veneration of images. For hitherto they had been <a id="l1555"></a> allowed both in the eastern &amp; western Churches only <a id="l1556"></a>for  instructing the people in history. The Emperor Leo Isaurus about 10 <a id="l1557"></a>years after  called a meeting  of  Counsellours <a id="l1558"></a>&amp; Bishops in his Palace for putting a stop to the  spreading <a id="l1559"></a>of this worship &amp; by their advice put out an Edict <a id="l1560"></a>against it &amp; wrote to  Pope Gregory the 2<sup>nd</sup> that a general Council might be called. But the  the Pope  thereupon  calling a <a id="l1561"></a>Council at Rome  confirmed the  worship of Images excommunicated the Greek Emperor, absolved his subjects in Italy <a id="l1562"></a>from their obedience &amp; forbad them to pay tribute to him  &amp; thereby caused  a great past <a id="l1563"></a>of the Exarchate to revolt &amp; kill Paul the Exarch. And the Lombards also being zelous <a id="l1564"></a>for the worship  of images &amp; pretending to favour the cause of the Pope invaded the <a id="l1565"></a>Cities of the Exarchate. At length Pope Zachary fearing the power of the Lombards deposed <a id="l1566"></a>Childeric a sloathful &amp; useless King of France, &amp; the last of the race of Merovæus &amp; absolving <a id="l1567"></a>his subjects from their oath of allegiance   gave the Kingdom to <a id="l1568"></a>Pipin King of Austrasia for  ever.  And thus by <a id="l1569"></a>the conjunction of these two Kingdoms  did one of the <a id="l1570"></a>ten horns  fall before the little horn. This was done <a id="l1571"></a>in the beginning of the year 752. The same year in <a id="l1572"></a>March this Pope died &amp; Stephen succeeded &amp;  <a id="l1573"></a>before the end of the year the Lombards tooke Ravenna <a id="l1574"></a>&amp; put an end to the exarchate. And this is the second of <a id="l1575"></a>the three Kingdoms that fell. Then Pope Stephen knowing better <a id="l1576"></a>how to deale with the Greek Emperor then with the Lombards <a id="l1577"></a>went the next year to their King to persuade him <a id="l1578"></a>to return the Exarchate to the  Emperor, but without <a id="l1579"></a>temporal success.  Whereupon the Pope went into France <a id="l1580"></a>&amp;  perswaded Pipin to  take the Exarchate &amp; Pentapolis from the Lombards &amp; give it to Saint Peter. And accordingly Pipin A.C. 754 came with <a id="l1583"></a>an Army into Italy &amp; made  Aistulphus King of the Lombards <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026v"> &lt;26v&gt; </span> promise the surrender. But the next year Aistulphus on <a id="l1584"></a>the contrary to revenge himself on the Pope beseiged the <a id="l1585"></a>City of Rome. Whereupon Pope Stephen sent letters to <a id="l1586"></a> Pipin wherein he told him that if he came not <a id="l1587"></a>speedily  against the  Lombards <em class="underline">pro data sibi <a id="l1588"></a>potentia alienandum fore a regno Dei et vita æterna</em>, he <a id="l1589"></a>would excommunicate him as he had done the  Greek Emperor. <a id="l1590"></a>Pipin therefore being devoted to the Church of Rome came <a id="l1591"></a>speedily with an army into Italy, raised the seige, beseiged the Lombards in <a id="l1592"></a>Papia &amp; forced them to surrender the Exarchate &amp; region <a id="l1593"></a>of Pentapolis to the Pope for a perpetual possession. And now <a id="l1594"></a>Ravenna  &amp; the rest were surrendered <a id="l1595"></a>some few cities excepted &amp; the Keys sent to Rome &amp; laid <a id="l1596"></a>upon the Confession of S. Peter, that is upon his Tomb at <a id="l1597"></a>the High Altar <em class="underline">in signum veri perpetiuique Dominij sed pietate regis gratuita</em> as <a id="l1598"></a>the inscription of a coin of Pipin has it.  And hence forward the Popes left <a id="l1600"></a>of in their Epistles &amp; Bulls to note the years of the <a id="l1601"></a> Greek Emperors as they had hitherto done. And now by <a id="l1602"></a>this  gift the pope became a temporal Prince &amp; the <a id="l1603"></a>Papacy a true horn of the Beast. This was in the year <a id="l1604"></a>755. Afterwards  the Lombards  invading <a id="l1605"></a>the Popes countries, Pope Adrian sent to Charles the <a id="l1606"></a>great the son of Pipin to come to his assistance &amp; <a id="l1607"></a>accordingly Charles  entred Italy with an army <a id="l1608"></a>invaded the Lombards overthrew their kingdom took Desiderius their King prisoner became <a id="l1609"></a>master of their countries, &amp; restored to the Pope not only what <a id="l1610"></a>they had taken from him,  but also the <a id="l1611"></a>rest of the Exarchate which they  had promised <a id="l1612"></a>Pipin to restore to the Pope but had hitherto detained  These things were done in the years 773 &amp; 774 <a id="l1614"></a>And now the Pope being arrived to his full temporal greatness  &amp; <a id="l1615"></a>freed from the fear of his enemies  did henceforward <a id="l1616"></a>reigne prosperously with  the Keys of the Cities in his hand  in lieu of <a id="l1617"></a>a scepter, &amp; a triple crown upon his head.  </p>
<p id="par98">These Crowns I take to be in memory that he ac<a id="l1618"></a>quired his countries by the ruin of two Kings &amp; the guift <a id="l1619"></a>of a third to whom he  had mu<a id="l1620"></a>tually given the Kingdom of France.  <a id="l1621"></a>Hincmarus &amp; Anastasius tell us that Clodovæus  King of France <a id="l1622"></a>being converted to the Roman faith sent Pope Hormisda a <a id="l1623"></a>golden Crown adorned with Iewels A.C. 514. This crown seems to be episcopal &amp; the Popes <a id="l1624"></a>might well  wear it also as a temporal one in memory of what afterwards past be<a id="l1625"></a>tween them &amp; the Kings of France &amp; add to it two others in re<a id="l1626"></a>spect of the Exarchate &amp; Kingdom of the Lombards by whose ruin  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the left margin of f 26v &gt; </span>they acquired all their temporal Dominions. Thus did three of the first Kings fall at once before this horn. By their <a id="l1627"></a>fall he grew up, &amp; became a  temporal King &amp; in  token thereof still wears a tripple crown.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 26v resumes &gt; </span>
