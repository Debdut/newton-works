<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Chap. VIII. <a id="l1"></a><br>The Monarchy of Egypt <a id="l2"></a>at Memphys.</h2>
<p id="par1">Herodotus &amp; Diodorus tell us from the Egyptian Priests <a id="l3"></a>that Orus the son of Osiris &amp; Isis was the last of the <a id="l4"></a>Gods  who reigned in Egypt &amp; that after the Gods <a id="l5"></a>&amp; Typhon Egypt was governed by men the first of which <a id="l6"></a>was Menes. So Iosephus saith that all the kings of Egypt <a id="l7"></a>from Minæus who built Memphys were called Pharaoh. <a id="l8"></a>So also Eratosthenes, Manetho, Africanus Eusebius &amp; <a id="l9"></a>Syncellus unanimously make Menes the first king of <a id="l10"></a>Egypt, that is after the Gods. He taught the people the <a id="l11"></a>adoration of the Gods &amp; the manner of divine worship <a id="l12"></a>&amp; therefore lived after the Gods of Egypt. He taught <a id="l13"></a>the people how to adorn their beds &amp; tables with rich <a id="l14"></a> cloaths &amp; coverings &amp; was the first that <a id="l15"></a>brought in a delicate &amp; sumptuous way of living and <a id="l16"></a>therefore reigned over a rich &amp; flourishing kingdom <a id="l17"></a>such as was scarce to be met with in Egypt before <a id="l18"></a>the expulsion of the Shepherds. He made a bridge over <a id="l19"></a>the Nile at Memphys &amp; twelve miles above Mem<a id="l20"></a>phys by making a great bank of earth turned the <a id="l21"></a>river into a new channel through the middle of the <a id="l22"></a>mountains &amp; the old channel being dried up he there <a id="l23"></a>built Memphys on the western side of the river <a id="l24"></a>&amp; therein he built the most magnificent &amp; memora<a id="l25"></a>ble Temple of Vulcan, works to great for any age <a id="l26"></a>before the reign of Sesostris. By the counsel of all antiquity he reigned after Osiris Isis &amp; Orus &amp; by consequence after Sesak &amp; the son of Sesak. He was the first that <a id="l27"></a>instituted written laws feigning that he received <a id="l28"></a>them from Mercury, &amp; therefore he reigned after <a id="l29"></a>Mercury had invented the Theban letters &amp; was deified. </p>
<p id="par2">Manethos<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> tells us of two Mercuries, the first called <a id="l30"></a>Thoth, the second the son of Agathodæmon &amp; father of <a id="l31"></a>Tat  who translated into books what the <a id="l32"></a>first wrote in the sacred dialect &amp; hieroglyphical letters on <a id="l33"></a>pillars in the Syringes or vaults neare Thebes, &amp; placed <a id="l34"></a>the books in the Adyta of the Temples of Egypt. The first <a id="l35"></a>was the Secretary of Osiris &amp; Isis, the second I take to be Athothis 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span>
whom Manetho &amp; Eratosthenes make the successor of Menes &amp; of <a id="l36"></a>whom Manetho saith that he built the royal Palace in Memphys <a id="l37"></a>&amp; wrote books of Anatomy being a Physitian. The invention of the <a id="l38"></a>Egyptian letters is by Sanchoniatho &amp; others ascribed to the first Mercury <a id="l39"></a>Till his days &amp; for a good while after they used the Hieroglyphic <a id="l40"></a>writing as appears by the Obelisks made by Sesostris &amp; some of his <a id="l41"></a>successors. But when the letters invented by this Mercury began <a id="l42"></a>to be in use, the Secretary of State wrote down the laws of Egypt <a id="l43"></a>in these letters &amp; translated the sacred inscriptions into books <a id="l44"></a>for the use of the Temples, &amp; this was done in the reign of <a id="l45"></a>Menes whose Secretary was therefore called the second Mercury. <a id="l46"></a>Anticlides wrote that one Menon or Menas  in<a id="l47"></a>vented letters in Egypt 15 years before Phoroneus a most ancient <a id="l48"></a>king of Greece &amp; endeavored to prove it by  ancient records &amp; monu<a id="l49"></a>ments. If Menas be Menes, the invention of letters is ascribed to <a id="l50"></a>him because he first brought them into use in Egypt. But if <a id="l51"></a>they were invented 15 years before the reign of Phoroneus, Menon <a id="l52"></a>or Menas may be Ammon the father of Sesostris, &amp; thus letters <a id="l53"></a>might be invented in Egypt before Cadmus brought them into Greece.</p>
<p id="par3">Menes  reigning next after the Gods &amp; semi-gods &amp; being <a id="l54"></a>the successor of Orus, lived in the times of the Argonautic expe<a id="l55"></a>dition &amp; Trojan war &amp; so was contemporary to Memnon. For they <a id="l56"></a>are but several names of the same king. Ffrom Amenophis or <a id="l57"></a>Amenoph by omitting the first  letter were formed Menphis, Mem<a id="l58"></a>phis, Moph, Noph, the names of his royal city &amp; also Menoph Menes, Memnon his own names.. The name Menes is by Era<a id="l59"></a>tosthenes interpreted Διόνιος Iovius &amp; therefore came from the <a id="l60"></a>word Ammon or Amenoph (the Egyptian name of Iupiter) by <a id="l61"></a>omitting the first letter. This is the great Iupiter of the Atlantides <a id="l62"></a>whose father Saturn by his ill manners &amp; covetousness lost the <a id="l63"></a>love of his people &amp; was thereupon expelled his kingdom by his <a id="l64"></a>son. This king is also called Amenephthes by Eusebius, Imandes, <a id="l65"></a> Ismandes &amp; Isimandes by Strabo, Osimandes by <a id="l66"></a>Heccatæus, Osimanduas æ Mendes by Diodorus.</p>
<p id="par4">Iosephus tells us out of Manetho that this Amenophis was <a id="l67"></a>a contemplator of the Gods as was Orus a former king, &amp; was <a id="l68"></a>perswaded by one of the Priests to purge Egypt from leaprous and <a id="l69"></a>impure men, &amp; for that end gathered then out of all Egypt to the number of 80000 &amp; <a id="l70"></a>granted them Abaris or Pelusium the city of Typhon to inhabit <a id="l71"></a>whereupon they conceiving this a fit place to make a rebellion <a id="l72"></a>made Osarsiphus Priest of Heliopolis their captain &amp; abolished the worship of the Theban Gods &amp; fortified <a id="l73"></a>their cities &amp; prepared for war against Amenophis &amp; called <a id="l74"></a>in the Iews from Ierusalem who came to Pelusium with an <a id="l75"></a>army of 200000 to their assistance. That this was the second <a id="l76"></a>invasion of Egypt by the Shepherds, &amp; that Amenophis came <a id="l77"></a>against them with an army of 300000 leaving his young <a id="l78"></a>son Ramesses (a child of five years old ) in the care of <a id="l79"></a>a friend, but before he fought Osarsiphus he returned back 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span>
to Memphys &amp; went thence into Ethiopia with all his ships &amp; <a id="l80"></a>multitude where he reigned 13 years while Osarsiphus &amp; the <a id="l81"></a>Iews reigned at Peleusium. That Osarsiphus was Moses &amp; <a id="l82"></a>made laws for the people at Abaris &amp; wasted the cities <a id="l83"></a>of Egypt: but after 13 years Amenophis came out of Ethi<a id="l84"></a>opia with a great army &amp; his son Ramesses joyned him <a id="l85"></a>with another army &amp; they fought the shepherds &amp; polluted <a id="l86"></a>people &amp; drave them out of Egypt pursuing them as far <a id="l87"></a>as the borders of Syria. And the same story is told by Che<a id="l88"></a>ræmon with some variation of circumstances. For Cheræ<a id="l89"></a>mon saith that when Amenophis retired into Ethiopia he <a id="l90"></a>left his wife big with child of Messenes, for so he calls <a id="l91"></a>Ramesses. Let the story be purged from the mistake that <a id="l92"></a>Osarsiphus was Moses &amp; from the calumny that the Egyptians <a id="l93"></a>who called in the Iews were leaprous æ  <a id="l94"></a>let it be compared with what the Atlantides relate of <a id="l95"></a>Iupiter's expelling his wicked father &amp; it will run thus, that <a id="l96"></a>when the army of Zerah was beaten at Maresch by the <a id="l97"></a>Iews, the  Egyptians to guard <a id="l101"></a>Egypt against the Iews placed great forces in Pelusium. <a id="l102"></a>that the people of Egypt &amp; Ethiopia revolting from Zerah set up Amenophis <a id="l103"></a>over them &amp; the Egyptians at Pelusium revolted from the <a id="l104"></a>Ethiopians &amp; made Osarsiphus their captain &amp; called in the <a id="l105"></a>victorious Iews to their assistance; that Amenophis led his <a id="l106"></a>army against Osarsiphus,  &amp; <a id="l109"></a> being afraid returned back to  Memphys without venturing a second <a id="l110"></a>battel against the Iews &amp;  from thence  went up into <a id="l111"></a>Thebais &amp; Ethiopia leaving his wife at Memphys either big <a id="l112"></a>with child or the child about  six or  eight years old. That India or some <a id="l113"></a>part thereof being in subjection to Egypt he sent for a body of <a id="l114"></a>Ethiopians from thence by sea to strengthen himself &amp; gave <a id="l115"></a>them seats above Egypt; for Eusebius<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> tells us: <em class="underline">Sub Amenophe <a id="l116"></a>Æthiopes ab Iudo flumine consurgentes juxta Ægyptum consede<a id="l117"></a>runt</em>. That after 13 years he returned with what force he <a id="l118"></a>&amp; his young son Ramesses could make &amp; conquered Osarsiphus &amp; drave <a id="l119"></a>out the Iews. And to this action Ramesses seemed to relate when <a id="l120"></a>he inscribed on his Obelisk (as Hermapion<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> interpreted it) that he <a id="l121"></a>had saved Egypt by expelling forreigners</p>
<p id="par5">Manetho saith that the shepherds obteined Egypt 511 years.</p>

<p id="par6" class="i0">the Roman Empire erected. This inscription seems to have been <a id="l122"></a>upon one of those Obelisks neare the monument of Memnon <a id="l123"></a>in Thebes mentioned by Strabo an eye witness. Above the Mem<a id="l124"></a>nomium saith he are the sepulchers of forty kings of Egypt <a id="l125"></a>in caves cut in stone &amp; by them in certain Obelisks inscriptions <a id="l126"></a>the riches &amp; power of those Kings &amp; the dominion <a id="l127"></a>propagated to Scythia &amp; Bactriana &amp; India &amp; Ionia with the <a id="l128"></a>greatness of their tribute &amp; their army of a thousand thou<a id="l129"></a>sand men.</p>
<p id="par7">Next reigned Amenophes called Amenephthes by Eusebius <a id="l130"></a>Imandes, Ismandes &amp; Isimandes by Strabo, Osymandes by Hecatæus <a id="l131"></a> æ  Osimanduas &amp; Mendes by Diodorus &amp; generally Memnon by the Greeks. His <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> mother was a Queen &amp; therefore we may reccon him of the royal race of Sesostris. By  the riches of his predecessor <a id="l132"></a>&amp; his own acquisitions he did such works as made him more known <a id="l133"></a>to the Greeks then any of the Kings He visited the conquests <a id="l134"></a>of Sesostris, marched through Ionia &amp; Phrygia, subdued the re<a id="l135"></a>belling Bactrians, staid long in Susiana &amp; left there a Palace <a id="l136"></a>&amp; other works which the Greeks called Memnonia. In Egypt <a id="l137"></a>at Abydus he built another stately Palace &amp; at Thebes <a id="l138"></a>on the west side of the Nile two Colossuses on of which was that famous statue which every <a id="l139"></a>morning at sun rise sounded with a musical voice. He built <a id="l140"></a>also  at Thebes for his sepulchre a very magnificent structure like a Temple  ten furlongs in circuit with several stately Porticos &amp; Galleries. At the entrance of one of the porticos were three ) <a id="l141"></a>statues his own his mothers &amp; his daughters  each of one stone. His own was the biggest statue in all Egypt the  measure of the foot thereof exceeding seven cubits. On this statue was  this inscription <a id="l142"></a></p>
<div class="lg">

<p id="par8" class="i0"> On the walls of one of the Galleries were Sculptures representing the war he made <a id="l143"></a>against the rebelling Bactrians with 400000 foot &amp; 20000 <a id="l144"></a>horse commanded in four bodies by his four sons &amp; also his <a id="l145"></a> beseiging a fortified place encompassed by a river (videlicet Susa) &amp; his carrying away captives &amp; triumphing for <a id="l146"></a>the victories.

<p id="par10">The innermost room where the Kings body was supposed to lye was very magnificent <a id="l173"></a>with  twenty  rich beds to eat upon &amp; the Statues of Iupiter Iuno &amp; the King &amp; apartments round about the room wherein were painted all the  beasts which are <a id="l174"></a>accounted sacred in Egypt. Thence were ascents to the top of the whole Monument of the Sepulchre <a id="l175"></a>which being mounted appeared a border of gold round the tomb of three hundred sixty <a id="l176"></a>five cubits in compass &amp; a cubit thick &amp; the days of the year were distinguisht &amp; <a id="l177"></a>inscribed on the several cubits a day on each cubit with the rising &amp; setting of the <a id="l178"></a>stars &amp; their signification according to the doctrine of the Egyptian Astrologers. This <a id="l179"></a>border was carried away by Cambyses when he conquered Egypt.</p>
<p id="par11">So sumptuous a monument as this border was would scarcely have been  made <a id="l180"></a>by this king &amp; placed next about his tomb, had it not been in memory of some<a id="l181"></a>thing done by himself. For all the rooms relate to him conteining representations of his person  <a id="l182"></a>actions Iustice riches   bounty piety, learning &amp; way of life. His Library denotes him  studious as <a id="l183"></a>well as warlike &amp; the  golden  border shews that he applied himself to <a id="l184"></a>the study of the stars &amp; made a new regulation of the year: // The first men <a id="l185"></a>would be apt to reccon time by lunar months &amp; by summers &amp; winters &amp; thence <a id="l186"></a>come the Luni-solar year. These months consisting usually of 29 &amp; 30 days alternately <a id="l187"></a>&amp; there being something more then twelve of these months in a year they <a id="l188"></a> afterwards enlarged the months allotting 30 days to every month  that 12 months might equal  the year &amp; this seems to be the <a id="l189"></a>oldest solar year &amp; the occasion of dividing a circle into 360 degrees. This <a id="l190"></a>year being still found too short the Egyptians added five days to the end of it  &amp; so <a id="l191"></a>made the year of 365 days. / Who added these days has been disputed but <a id="l192"></a>this  monument shews it was done by this King. //  <a id="l193"></a>Arts &amp; sciences are most apt to flourish in great kingdoms these &amp;  a Kalender to <a id="l194"></a>be reformed upon setting a new dominion, &amp; Memnon was he that restored <a id="l195"></a>the Dominion &amp; peace of Egypt. // And even the year itself points at him for its <a id="l196"></a>author. For  by the year which the Israelites brought out of Egypt it a it began at the vernal equinox in his reign <a id="l198"></a>&amp; therefore was either constituted by him or else was much older then the Egyptian <a id="l199"></a>Monarchy. If you re – – – – period 3821 (&amp; for three years after) on the <a id="l200"></a> third day of April, which was then the first day after the vernal Equinox according <a id="l201"></a>to the Suns mean motion, &amp; that year was about  55 years after the <a id="l202"></a> overthrow of the Ethiopians by Asa which I reccon within the compas of his reign. For  Memnons actions <a id="l203"></a>after that  victory make him long lived,   &amp; its proba<a id="l205"></a>ble that he minded not Astronomy till after he had finished his wars, which in <a id="l206"></a>Egypt &amp; Asia together might take him up the first thirty  or 35 years of that time. <a id="l207"></a>Damis saith that he died in Ethiopia after he had reigned 5 generations.</p>
<p id="par12">After this year was instituted the Egyptians observing more accurately the length <a id="l208"></a>of the year by the Heliacal rising of the stars</p>
<p id="par13"> He did not therefore know that this year was too short by a 1/4t<sup>ter</sup> of <a id="l209"></a>a day so as in every 4 years to make the stars change the day of their heliacal rising &amp; setting <a id="l210"></a>For had he know this  (as he would have done had this year been older then his <a id="l211"></a>reign) he would not have noted their rising &amp; setting on certain days of this year <a id="l212"></a>in a Monument which he designed to be lasting. Astronomy was therefore then in its <a id="l213"></a>infancy &amp; may reccon him its founder.</p>
<p id="par14">Afterwards  the Egyptians by continuing to observe the rising &amp; setting of <a id="l214"></a>the stars found that this year was too short by a quarter of a day, that is by <a id="l215"></a>a year in 1460 years &amp; thence formed their Annus magnus  of 1460 Egypti<a id="l216"></a>an years in which time the beginning of their year ran round the Zodiack. But the difference between the  solar &amp; the sidereal year they had not yet observed. This great year they called <a id="l217"></a>   canicular because they determined its length by the rising of the Dog star.

<p id="par18" class="i0">&amp; thereupon made  a fable that  Rhea being with child by Saturn the Sun <a id="l245"></a>playd she might not be delivered in any month nor in the year:  &amp; that Mercury won  from Luna <a id="l246"></a>at dice so much time  as made five days &amp; added them to <a id="l247"></a>the 360 days. In giving this account how the Sun got 5 days to his year &amp; the moon <a id="l248"></a>lose as many from hers, they make the year before this alteration to consist of 360 <a id="l249"></a>days. And on that account they called the 5 days επαγομενοι additional to the year.</p>
<p id="par19">So Moses describes the duration of the flood by months of 30 days each &amp; &amp; to  <a id="l250"></a>a year of 12 such months Iohn alluded in the Apocalyps in making three times (or years) &amp; an <a id="l251"></a>half equal to 42 months &amp; those equal to 1260 days. And solon in discoursing <a id="l252"></a>with Cræsus reccons seventy years of 360 days each &amp; then tells us of intercalary months every <a id="l253"></a>other year. For the Athenians every other year added  months of 10 &amp; 11 days alternately   having been taught  the length <a id="l255"></a>of the solar year by the Egyptians.</p>
<p id="par20">The first men would be apt to take notice of the revolutions of the sun &amp; moon &amp; <a id="l256"></a> the returns of summer &amp; winter &amp; thence came the recconings of time by days months &amp; <a id="l257"></a>years, &amp; the  forming of Lunisolar years. Then finding that these months  consisted of 29 &amp; 30 days alternately <a id="l258"></a> &amp; that there were something more then 12 such months in a summer &amp; winter <a id="l259"></a>they  took the round numbers of 30 days to a month &amp; 12 months to a year &amp;  accordingly divided the Zodiac into 12 signs &amp; every sign into 30 degrees &amp; this seems to be <a id="l261"></a>the oldest solar year &amp; the grownd of dividing  a  <a id="l263"></a>circle into 360 degrees. So Moses describes the duration of the flood by months of <a id="l264"></a>30 days each &amp;  Solon in discoursing with Cræsus reccons <a id="l265"></a>70 years of 360 days each &amp;  to such years Iohn alludes in the Apocalyps <a id="l266"></a>in making 3 times (or years) &amp; an half equal to 42 months &amp; those to 1260 days. At <a id="l267"></a>length finding this year too short  the Egyptians added 5 days to the end of it,  <a id="l268"></a> &amp; as they had before dedicated the 12 months to the 12 Gods so now &amp; called those  days ἐπαγόμενας <a id="l269"></a>additional days &amp; dedicated them to <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>nativiti<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>es of their Gods Osyris Isis  Orus Typhon Nephthe. &amp; in memory of the  addition formed this fable <a id="l270"></a>that Rhea being with child by Saturn the sun prayd she might not be delivered <a id="l271"></a>in any month nor in the year &amp; that Mercury won from Luna at Dice  the  two &amp; seventieth part of every day <a id="l272"></a> which of the whole yeare made up 5   days &amp; added those 5 days to the  <a id="l273"></a>  360. This is the reason they give why men made the Solar year  longer &amp; the Lunar shorter then the old year of 360 days. //Tis agreed that this alteration of the ancient Solar year <a id="l274"></a>was made by the Egyptians, &amp; this Monument by dividing the circle into 365 degrees shews that it was <a id="l275"></a>made in the reign of Amenophis. He restored the dominion of Egypt &amp; Calendars <a id="l276"></a>are seldome reformed but upon setting up new dominions. Nor perhaps was <a id="l277"></a>any king big enough to do it before him &amp; Sesostris.</p>
<p id="par21">And even the year it self of 365 days points at him for the author. The <a id="l278"></a>first ages  in recconing by summers &amp; winters would be apt (like Thucydides in his <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>hist<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>) to begin <a id="l279"></a>their year in spring or autumn. So did the Iews in the year which they brought <a id="l280"></a>out of Egypt. And if the Egyptians did the same,  &amp; accordingly began this year at one of the Equinoxes at its first institution.  it was either instituted by him or very much older then he – <a id="l282"></a>Now if this year was made to begin at the autumnal equinox twas an hundred <a id="l283"></a>years older then Moses, if at the rising of the Dog star (as some think) twas 300 years older <a id="l284"></a>then Sesak (&amp; on this ground Syncellus seems to ascribe it to the Shepherds), but if at the vernal equinox it began in the reign of this king. <a id="l285"></a>For  this egyptian year was the same with the year of Nabonassar &amp; in the year of the Iulian <a id="l286"></a>Period 3821 (&amp; for 3 years after)  began on the 3<sup>d</sup> of April which was then the first <a id="l287"></a>day after the vernal equinox according to the Suns mean motion, &amp; that Iulian year was <a id="l288"></a> 55 years after the overthrow of the Ethiopians by Asa which I reccon within the <a id="l289"></a>compass of the reign of Amenophis.

This inscription seems to have been <a id="l290"></a>upon one of those Obelisks neare the Monument of <a id="l291"></a>Memnon in Thebes mentioned by Strabo an eye witness. Above the <a id="l292"></a>Memnonium saith he are the Sepulchres of forty kings of Egypt <a id="l293"></a>in caves cut in stone &amp; by them in certain Obelisks inscriptions <a id="l294"></a>declaring the riches &amp; power of those kings &amp; their dominion <a id="l295"></a>propagated to Scythia &amp; Bactriana &amp; India &amp; Ionia with the <a id="l296"></a>greatness of their tribute &amp; their army of a thousand thou<a id="l297"></a>sand men.</p>

<p id="par24"> Next reigned Amenophis called Amenephthes by Eusebius, Imandes Ismandes &amp; Isimandes by Strabo, Osimandes by Hecatæus, Osimanduas &amp; Mendes by Diodorus. His <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> mother was a Queen &amp;  he was the <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> son of Rhampses. In his reign &amp; in the 14 or 15<sup>th</sup> year of Asa King <a id="l299"></a>of Iuda <sup> c</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup>, Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand <a id="l300"></a>thousand Ethiopians <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> &amp;  Libyans invaded Iudea. Their way was through <a id="l301"></a>Egypt &amp; they  seem to have made a considerable stay <a id="l302"></a>there. For Asa had peace ten years before they  invaded him <a id="l303"></a>&amp; long  prepard to meet either them or the Egyptians. For while the land was yet <a id="l304"></a>before him he  sought the lord &amp; destroyed Idolatry <a id="l305"></a>&amp; fortified the cities of Iudea with walls &amp; towers &amp; gates &amp; <a id="l306"></a>barrs &amp; prepared an army of five hundred &amp; eighty thousand <a id="l307"></a>men. This he did without any checque from the Egyptians they <a id="l308"></a>having work enough at home. At length when the Ethiopians <a id="l309"></a>advanced from Egypt, he met them  with this army <a id="l310"></a>&amp; routed them totaly at Mareshah  a town of Iudea towards Egypt &amp; pur<a id="l311"></a>sued them to Gerar &amp;  smote the cities about Gerar &amp; <a id="l312"></a>as he returned with much spoile Azariah the prophet went <a id="l313"></a>out to meet him &amp; said <em class="underline">Hear me Asa &amp; Iudah &amp; Benja<a id="l314"></a>min. The Lord is with you while ye be with him &amp; if ye seek <a id="l315"></a>him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will <a id="l316"></a>forsake you. Now for a long season Israel hath been with<a id="l317"></a>out a true God &amp; without a teaching Priest &amp; without Law.  <a id="l318"></a>And in those times</em> [videlicet under the dominion of Egypt] <em class="underline">there was no peace to him that went <a id="l319"></a>out nor to him that came in but great vexations were upon <a id="l320"></a>all the inhabitants of the countries &amp; nation was destroyed <a id="l321"></a>of nation &amp; city of city: For God did vex them with <a id="l322"></a>all adversity. But when Israel in their trouble</em> [videlicet out of <a id="l323"></a>fear of the Ethiopians] <em class="underline">did turn unto the Lord &amp; sought him <a id="l324"></a>he was found of them</em>. The Ethiopians therefore invaded <a id="l325"></a>Egypt before he began to seek the Lord &amp; by consequence stayed <a id="l326"></a>in Egypt some years before they invaded  Iudea.</p>
<p id="par25">By this victory the Iews shook of the dominion of Egypt <a id="l327"></a>For whereas Sesak had taken away all the treasures of the <a id="l328"></a>Temple Asa now brought into the Temple the silver &amp; gold <a id="l329"></a>&amp; vessels which he &amp; his father had dedicated in the room of <a id="l330"></a>what Sesak had taken away. And henceforward he and <a id="l331"></a>his son Iehosaphat  flou<a id="l332"></a>rished in power &amp; wealth for  many years. So then by this

invasion the dominion of Egypt was shaken so that Herodotus <a id="l333"></a>was not much out when he wrote that Sesostris was the <a id="l334"></a>only King that enjoyed the Empire. </p>
<p id="par26">Iosephus tells us out of Manetho &amp; Chæremon that in <a id="l335"></a>the reign of Amenophis (that Amenophis who was the son of <a id="l336"></a> Rampsus &amp; grandson of Sethos &amp; father of Ramesses) a <a id="l337"></a>great body of Egyptians revolted at Pelusium &amp; had a polity <a id="l338"></a>&amp; laws given them by Osarsiphus Priest of Heliopolis &amp; <a id="l339"></a>called in a body of Iews from Ierusalem to their assistance <a id="l340"></a>&amp; that Amenophis leaving his wife with child of Ramesses or the child but 5 years old fled to Ethiopia where the King of <a id="l341"></a>Ethiopia was voluntarily subject to him &amp; after thirteen <a id="l342"></a>years  exile or above his young son Ramesses drave out <a id="l343"></a>the rebells &amp; the Iews to the borders of Syria &amp; called  back his father. This story <a id="l344"></a>Manetho &amp; Chæremon have distorted applying it to the <a id="l345"></a>times of Moses as if Moses were Osarsiphus &amp; the <a id="l346"></a>Israelites whom Moses led out of Egypt were the <a id="l347"></a>Iews  now expelled by Amenophis. Let the story <a id="l348"></a>be purged from what belongs to that fiction &amp; it will <a id="l349"></a>amount to this that after the Ethiopians were routed <a id="l350"></a>at Maresah the Ethiopians called in the victorious <a id="l351"></a>Iews to their assistance &amp; then  by a new war drove out the Ethiopians &amp; Libyans from the lower Egypt &amp; made them retire into Thebais &amp; the  adjacent parts of Ethiopia carrying along with them with Amenophis &amp; other captives, &amp; that Amenophis staid in exile till his son Ramesses grew up,  had the government put into his hands by the Egyptians,  <a id="l357"></a>conquered the Ethiopians abovementioned &amp; brought back his father &amp; obliged the Iews to withdraw out of Egypt into Syria. And <a id="l358"></a>to this action Ramesses seems to relate when he inscribed <a id="l359"></a>on his obelisk (as Hermapion<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> interpreted it) <em class="underline">that he had saved <a id="l360"></a>Egypt by expelling forreigners.</em> And Eusebius<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> <em class="underline">Sub Amenophe Æthiopes ab Inde flumine consurgentes, juxta Ægyptum consederunt</em>.</p>
<p id="par27">Amenophis having recovered Egypt &amp; being now inured <a id="l361"></a>to war led his army out of Egypt to visit the conquests of <a id="l362"></a>Sesostris, marched through Ionia &amp; Phrygia, subdued the rebbelling <a id="l363"></a>Bactrians,  took Susa staid long there &amp; <a id="l364"></a>left there a Palace &amp; other works which the Greeks call <a id="l365"></a>Memnonia.

It was 3600 stadiums or <a id="l499"></a>450 miles in compass &amp; 50 paces deep where deepest.

<p id="par38">Among the successors of Sesostris Herodotus &amp; Diodorus reccon the <a id="l514"></a>founders of the  three great Pyramids neare Memphys. The  first <a id="l515"></a>&amp; greatest was  built by Cheops called also Chembis, Chemmis Suphis <a id="l516"></a>Siphoas Saophis &amp; Syphuris Phiops, Apappus maximus, the  middlemost by his daughter, the third <a id="l517"></a>by his brother &amp; successor  Chephren called also Suphis, Saophis, <a id="l518"></a>&amp; Sen Soaphis Mente Suphis. Diodorus attributes the second to Chephren &amp; the <a id="l519"></a>third to Mycerinus the  son of Suphis &amp; successor of Che<a id="l520"></a>pren.  Manetho attributes the third to Nitocris the successor &amp; sister of Mente Suphis. In the chronical canons he is called  Moscheres &amp; Men<a id="l521"></a>cheres. Saophis  or Suphis was a merchant &amp; contemplator of the Gods &amp; <a id="l522"></a>wrote a sacred book which saith Manetho I procured in Egypt: whence <a id="l523"></a>they called  him Mercury. This was  he therefore  who wrote <a id="l524"></a>those books  which  &amp; who assumed the <a id="l525"></a>title of Trismegistus. Herodotus writes that he interdicted the sacrifices &amp; shut <a id="l526"></a>up the Temples during his reign to imploy the people in his works. But  this looks like <a id="l527"></a>a story made by those who were angry at the Pyramids. [He seems to be the same <a id="l528"></a>with Nichepsus. For Syncellus makes Nichepsus the successor of Thuoris &amp; the name has <a id="l529"></a>affinity with Cheops &amp; the Character of the person with Mercury. For Niceps is <a id="l530"></a> was  a great Astronomer the first that invented &amp; wrote of Astrological predictions &amp; nativities &amp; of the 36 Deca<a id="l531"></a>ni into which the heaven is divided with their powers, teaching all things that belonged to the <a id="l532"></a>art. &amp; being therein followed by the Chaldeans &amp; Magi.

The first of them Herodotus calls Asychis <a id="l535"></a>&amp; saith that he made the very large &amp; beautiful eastern Portico of <a id="l536"></a>the Temple of Vulcane &amp; a brick Pyramid with an inscription <a id="l537"></a>signifying that it excelled the other Pyramids as much as Iupiter <a id="l538"></a>did the other Gods because made of clay fetcht from the bottom <a id="l539"></a>of a lake with a long staff.  And besides these Pyra<a id="l540"></a>mids there were about 18 others neare the Mummies one of which <a id="l541"></a>is recconed by Greves to be equal to the greatest of the 3 neare <a id="l542"></a>Memphis but the most of them were  much smaller.

<p id="par42">Amenophis having recovered the dominion of Egypt &amp; Libya <a id="l559"></a>&amp; being now potent &amp; inured to war, led his army out of <a id="l560"></a>Egypt to visit the conquests of Sesostris, marched through <a id="l561"></a>Ionia &amp; Phrygia, subdued the rebelling Bactrians, took Susa, <a id="l562"></a>reigned long there &amp; left there a Palace &amp; other works <a id="l563"></a>which the Greeks call Memnonia.

Pausanias<sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup> speaking of this statue saith that <em class="underline">he <a id="l568"></a>most admired the Colossus of the Egyptians in Thebais be<a id="l569"></a>yond the Nile at the place called the Syringes.

Ameno<a id="l579"></a>phis built also at Thebes his own sepulchre<sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> a very <a id="l580"></a>magnificent structure like a Temple ten furlongs in <a id="l581"></a>circuit with several stately Porticos &amp; Galleries.

At the entrance <a id="l585"></a>of one of the Porticos were three statues, his own his mothers <a id="l586"></a>&amp; his daughters each of one stone. His own was the biggest <a id="l587"></a>statue in all Egypt the measure of the foot thereof exceed<a id="l588"></a>ing seven cubits. It had this inscription.</p>

<p id="par43" class="i0">There was also another statue of his mother with three crowns <a id="l589"></a>on her head to denote that she was the daughter wife &amp; <a id="l590"></a>mother of a king, videlicet Rhea the daughter of Ammon. On <a id="l591"></a>the walls of one of the Galleries were sculptures repre<a id="l592"></a>senting the war he made against the rebelling Bactri<a id="l593"></a>ans with 400000 foot &amp; 20000 horse commanded in <a id="l594"></a>four bodies by his four sons, &amp; also his beseiging a <a id="l595"></a>bulwark incompassed with a river (videlicet Susa) &amp; his carry<a id="l596"></a>ing away captives &amp; triumphing for these victories. In <a id="l597"></a>the next room was delineated a Court of Iustice with <a id="l598"></a>people about the Iudge &amp; in the next was represented <a id="l599"></a>the Kings Table sumptuously furnished &amp; his riches <a id="l600"></a>&amp; offerings to the Gods. In the next room was his Library <a id="l601"></a>with this inscription, <em class="underline">The cure of the mind</em>: &amp; adjoyning <a id="l602"></a>to it were the Images of the Gods &amp; the King making <a id="l603"></a>offerings peculiarly belonging to each of them. Next the <a id="l604"></a>Library was a stately room wherein were twenty beds <a id="l605"></a>to eat upon richly adorned &amp; the images of Iupiter &amp; <a id="l606"></a>Iuno &amp; the King. And here it's supposed that the kings <a id="l607"></a>body lyes interred. Round the room were many apartments <a id="l608"></a>wherein were painted all the beasts that are accounted <a id="l609"></a>sacred in Egypt. Thence were ascents to the top of the <a id="l610"></a>whole Monument which being mounted appeared a border <a id="l611"></a>of gold round the Tomb of three hundred sixty five <a id="l612"></a>cubits in compass &amp; a cubit thick &amp; the days of the year <a id="l613"></a>were distinguished &amp; inscribed on the several cubits a day <a id="l614"></a>on each cubit with the rising &amp; setting of the stars &amp; their <a id="l615"></a>signification according to the doctrine of the Egyptian <a id="l616"></a>Astrologers. This border was carried away by Cambyses <a id="l617"></a>when he conquered Egypt.</p>
<p id="par44">So sumptuous a monument as this golden border <a id="l618"></a>would scarce have been made by this king or his successor &amp; placed in <a id="l619"></a>the principal room next about his Tomb had it not been <a id="l620"></a>in memory of something done by himself. For all the <a id="l621"></a>rooms of this Temple relate to him, conteining repre<a id="l622"></a>sentations of his person, actions, justice, riches, table, <a id="l623"></a>bounty piety &amp; learning. In one room he is repre<a id="l624"></a>sented making war, in another doing justice, in a third <a id="l625"></a>honouring the Gods, in a fourth his Library denotes him 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span>
studious, in the last room the golden border shews that <a id="l626"></a>after he had restored the Egyptian Monarchy he applied <a id="l627"></a>himself to the study of the stars &amp; by their risings &amp; settings <a id="l628"></a>made a new regulation of the year.</p>
<p id="par45">You have heard how Ammon was much addicted <a id="l629"></a>to Astronomy &amp; from him the study descended to his <a id="l630"></a>children &amp; grandchildren Hyperion,  Atlas, Typhon <a id="l631"></a>Mercury, Memnon, Prometheus. How the court of Egypt <a id="l632"></a>came to be so much addicted to this study I do not find <a id="l633"></a>in history, but if room may be allowed for conjecture <a id="l634"></a>I suspect that the Merchants trading upon the red Sea <a id="l635"></a>were the first that found out letters numbers &amp; Arith<a id="l636"></a>metick &amp; observed the stars, these things being useful in <a id="l637"></a>their trafique &amp; that when the court of Edom fled from <a id="l638"></a>David into Egypt they carried these things with them to <a id="l639"></a>the court of Pharaoh, &amp; on that accompt were enter<a id="l640"></a>teined there with so much favour as is mentioned in <a id="l641"></a>scripture. Ammon divided the days into hours but the year <a id="l642"></a>which he used was lunisolar as you heard above, &amp; this year <a id="l643"></a>being of an uncertain length &amp; therefore unfit for <a id="l644"></a>Astronomical uses a new year was to be invented for <a id="l645"></a>keeping an exact amount of time before Astronomy <a id="l646"></a>could be brought to any competent degree of perfection <a id="l647"></a>And the first attempt that I meet with of that kind <a id="l648"></a>was in the reign of Osiris.</p>
<p id="par46">For <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> in the holy Isle of Nile neare Phylas was a <a id="l649"></a>sepulchre built to Osiris religiously reverenced by all the <a id="l650"></a>Priests of Egypt wherein were laid up 360 Bowles which <a id="l651"></a>certain Priests appointed for that purpose filled every <a id="l652"></a>day with milk (that is every day one Bowle) &amp; called <a id="l653"></a>upon the Gods by name with mourning &amp; lamentation<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n36-ref">[36]</sup>. <a id="l654"></a>These Bowles answer in number to the 360 days of <a id="l655"></a>which the year was anciently supposed to consist, &amp; the <a id="l656"></a>designe of filling them seems to be for counting the <a id="l657"></a>days in order to  measure time by such a yeare.</p>
<p id="par47">The first ages being destitute of Arithmetic &amp; <a id="l658"></a>Astronomy counted months by the visible returns of the <a id="l659"></a>Moon &amp; years by the visible returns of  Sun or of the four seasones of the year Summer &amp; <a id="l660"></a>winter spring &amp; autumn according to the saying of Moses that the sun &amp; <a id="l661"></a>Moon were for signes &amp; for Seasons &amp; for days &amp; for <a id="l662"></a>years that is, the Moon for signes of the Months &amp; for seasons recconed from three months to three months, &amp; the sun for days &amp; for years.. And this practise occasioned their celebrating the <a id="l663"></a>new moons &amp; new years days with feasting. And as often    
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013r"> &lt;13r&gt; </span>
as they perceived twelve lunar months too short for <a id="l664"></a>the returning seasons of the year or for the rising <a id="l665"></a>or setting of some star, they added a thirteenth. By this <a id="l666"></a>means the Hebrews always began their sacred year <a id="l667"></a>in spring &amp; their civil year in Autumn in the seventh <a id="l668"></a>month of their sacred year so that the same months <a id="l669"></a>always fell upon the same seasons of the year. For <a id="l670"></a>in the month Abib they always offered the first fruits <a id="l671"></a>of the corn in the ear &amp; forty days after they offered <a id="l672"></a>the first fruits of the harvest &amp; after they had ga<a id="l673"></a>thered the fruit of the land they kept the Feast of <a id="l674"></a>Tabernacles in the month Tisri. This year was brought <a id="l675"></a>out of Egypt by the Hebrews &amp; therefore was the old Egyptian <a id="l676"></a>year. For Diodorus tells us that Hyperion an ancient <a id="l677"></a>king of Egypt used the Lunisolar year, and Moses, <a id="l678"></a>while he was yet in Egypt changed the beginning of the <a id="l679"></a>year from one month to another without altering the <a id="l680"></a>form of it. Exod 12. And so the year which the Samaritans brought with them out of Assyria, and the ancient Chaldæan year <a id="l681"></a>which the Iews brought back with them from the Babylonian <a id="l682"></a>captivity was Lunisolar.  Vpon the 16<sup>th</sup> day of the month <a id="l683"></a>Lous the Babylonians annually celebrated the feast Sacæa <a id="l684"></a>as Athenaus (Lib. 12) relates out of Berosus, that is, upon <a id="l685"></a>the 16<sup>th</sup> day of the Babylonian month which fell in with <a id="l686"></a>the month Lous of the Macedonians &amp; which was therefore <a id="l687"></a>Lunar &amp; kept to the season of the year the month <a id="l688"></a>Lous being a summer month answering to the month Ab <a id="l689"></a>of the year which the Iews brought from Babylon. This <a id="l690"></a>month Ab had its name from אב which signifies corn &amp; other <a id="l691"></a>vegetables of the earth in that state when they are most <a id="l692"></a>green &amp; flourishing &amp; the next month אלול Elul signifies <a id="l693"></a>the time when the earth is new reaped &amp; emptied of <a id="l694"></a>corn. Which being the names of the Chaldæan months shews <a id="l695"></a>that their months were fixed to the seasons. Chaldea was <a id="l696"></a>peopled by Arabians &amp; the Arabian months are <a id="l697"></a>Lunar to this day, &amp; anciently their years were Luni<a id="l698"></a>solar, as were also the years of the  Syrians &amp; <a id="l699"></a>people of Asia minor &amp; Athenians &amp; Romans.

<p id="par48">And Censorinus tells us that – natural year And Cicero that <a id="l710"></a>the Sicilians – or two days. So also Aratus &amp; his Commentator Theon – <a id="l711"></a>seasons (Lib. 1, 2.)  And Hesiod makes Lenæon a winter Month - Pleiades. And <a id="l712"></a>Scaliger &amp; others inform us also that the ancient years of   Persia India <a id="l713"></a>China &amp;  the adjacent Isles were Lunisolar </p>
<p id="par49">Now The Lunar Month usually ending upon the 30<sup>th</sup> day, the ancient nations <a id="l715"></a>in their recconings  used 30 days for a month: but Solon finding this month <a id="l716"></a>too long  called the 30<sup>th</sup> day ἠνην καὶ νεαν the old &amp; the new &amp; taught the <a id="l717"></a>Athenians to count the months by 30 &amp; 29 days alternately. These were <a id="l718"></a>the Kalender months of the Ancients which they used  without <a id="l719"></a>correction in recconing times past or to come, where they could not be assisted by the course of the Moon    So Moses  in describing the flood <a id="l723"></a>puts 15 months for 150 days &amp;  the author of the Book of Esther puts 180 days  <a id="l724"></a>for six months, &amp; Herodotus in recconing the age of man constantly takes <a id="l725"></a>30 days for a month. But in recconing times present they always corrected <a id="l726"></a>their months by the course of the Moon as you heard above, adding or <a id="l727"></a>omitting a day or two in the month as often as they found it necessary to <a id="l728"></a>make their months agree with the revolutions of the Moon.</p>
<p id="par50">And as for the year or Annus vertens they  recconed it to consist of twelve <a id="l729"></a>months, but finding this year too short they added a month to the <a id="l730"></a>end of it as often as they found it requisite to make the year agre <a id="l731"></a>with the Sun &amp; seasons. And hence arose several  longer periods of time <a id="l732"></a>as the Dieteris which consisted of two years &amp; a month, the Tetraeteris <a id="l733"></a>which consisted of 4 years &amp; one or two months, the Octaeteris which <a id="l734"></a>consisted of 8 years &amp; three months, &amp; the Enneadeaeteris which consisted <a id="l735"></a>of 19 years &amp; seven months. But the Egyptians instead of these intercalary months added five days to the end of the year.</p>
<p id="par51">The ancient Kalender-year therefore consisted of 12 months each of which had <a id="l736"></a>30 days  &amp; hence came the division of the Zodiaque <a id="l737"></a>into 12 signs  &amp; of every signe into 30 parts or degrees  a signe answering to a month &amp;  a degree to a day.   But this year  being too short for the return of the seasons  they added a month <a id="l743"></a>to it every other year excepting once in eight years
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015av"> &lt;15av&gt; </span> and thence formed the Dieteris consisting three times of 25 months &amp; once of <a id="l744"></a>24, the Tetraeteris consisting alternately of 49 &amp; 50 months &amp; the Octaeteris <a id="l745"></a>consisting of 99 months. For Herodotus &amp; Censorinus  Plutarch tell us that the <a id="l746"></a> ancient Greeks  added a month to the end of every other <a id="l747"></a>year   to make this year agree with the <a id="l748"></a>seasons &amp; course of the Sun, &amp; thereby saith Censorinus they formed <a id="l749"></a> the Dieteris,  Tetraeteris &amp; Octaeteris. And the year <a id="l750"></a>to which this month was added Herodotus describes to consist of twelve months <a id="l751"></a> &amp; every month of 30 days ,  For he speaks of the Kalendar months without <a id="l752"></a> considering the course of the Moon by which they were to be <a id="l753"></a>corrected. </p>
<p id="par52">Now these periods of time seem to be as ancient in Greece as the <a id="l754"></a>first memory of things. &amp; were probably brought into Greece by the Phenicians &amp; Egyptians who first sailed thither. For the Octaeteris was  the annus magnus of Cadmus &amp; Minos &amp; <a id="l756"></a>was used in many religions of Greece &amp; in celebrating the Olympic games <a id="l757"></a>first instituted by Pelops &amp; Hercules one of the Idæi Dactyli, &amp; the <a id="l758"></a>Dieteris was used in celebrating the mysteries of Bacchus. And Herodotus <a id="l759"></a>tells us that the Greeks had their festivals from Egypt &amp; Festus Avienus <a id="l760"></a>seems to attribute a regulation of the year  to Cecrops the Egyptian, where speaking <a id="l761"></a>of  the Enneaeteris of Harpalus <a id="l762"></a>turned into the Enneadecaeteris  by Meton he saith</p>
<div class="lg">

</div><br><br>    

<p id="par54">The emendation of the year by intercalary months being <a id="l764"></a>troublesome &amp; unfit for Astronomical uses the Egyptians neglected <a id="l765"></a>the course of the Moon &amp; counting all the 360 days in the <a id="l766"></a>Kalendar year they found them too short for the course of the <a id="l767"></a>Sun by five days &amp; therefore added five days to the end of the <a id="l768"></a>360 </p>
<p id="par55">For After the Greeks had for some time used their first Octaeteris <a id="l769"></a>they mended it several ways, as by altering the order of the intercalary <a id="l770"></a>Months, by countig the 12 months of 29 &amp; 30 days alternately &amp; 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015br"> &lt;15br&gt; </span>
making the 13<sup>th</sup> month always of 30 days &amp; by adding 3 days in every 16 <a id="l771"></a>years,  &amp; at length they found out the  Enneadecaeteris <a id="l772"></a>whereby they became  able to publish Almanacks or Kalendars <a id="l773"></a>of time for nineteen years to come &amp; a while after by the cycle <a id="l774"></a>of Calippus for 76 years to come.</p>
<p id="par56">But in doing these things – Chaldeans.</p>
<p id="par57">The Egyptians were therefore the firs –</p>

<p id="par58">as they perceived twelve lunar months too short  for <a id="l775"></a>the returning seasons of the year or for the rising or setting <a id="l776"></a>of some star, they added a thirteenth. By this means <a id="l777"></a>the Hebrews always began their sacred year in spring &amp; their civil year in Autumn <a id="l778"></a>in the seventh month of their sacred year so that the <a id="l779"></a>same months always fell upon the same seasons of the<a id="l780"></a>year. For in the month Abib they always offered the <a id="l781"></a>first fruits of the corn in the ear &amp; forty days after <a id="l782"></a>they offered the first fruits of the harvest &amp; after they <a id="l783"></a>had gathered the fruit of the land they kept the <a id="l784"></a>Feast of Tabernacles in the month Tisri. This year <a id="l785"></a>was brought out of Egypt by the Hebrews &amp; therefore <a id="l786"></a>was the old Egyptian year For Moses while he was yet in Egypt changed the beginning of  from one month to another  without altering the form of it. Exod 12. And Diodorus tells us that Hyperion an ancient king of Egypt used the Lunisolar year.. 2 And by the like practise <a id="l787"></a>the months of the old year of the Greeks were lunar &amp; always kept <a id="l788"></a>to the same seasons of the year so that the Olympic games were always celebrated at Midsummer &amp; other <a id="l789"></a>festivals at other set seasons of the year. And Hesiod<sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup> makes <a id="l790"></a>Lenæon a winter month &amp; begins the year after the <a id="l791"></a>rising of the Pleiades. 1  And so the Chaldean Lunisolar year which the Iews brought back with them from the Babylonian captivity kept to the seasons of the year. And upon the sixteenth day of the month Lous the Babylonians annually celebrated the Feast  Sacæa as Athenæus (Lib. 12) relates out of Berosus; that is, upon the sixteenth day of the Babylonian month which fell in with the month Lous of the Macedonians, &amp; which was therefore Lunar &amp; kept to the course of the Moon &amp; to the same season of the year, the month Lous being a summer month answering to the month Ab of the year which the Iews brought from Babylon.</p>
<p id="par59">At first the nations were without Astronomical rules, but at length observing that there were three inter<a id="l797"></a>calary months in eight years or thereabouts, they formed an <a id="l798"></a>Octaeteris by which they knew when to add the intercalary <a id="l799"></a>months without minding the seasons of summer &amp; winter or the <a id="l800"></a>risings &amp; settings of the stars above once in eight years. And this <a id="l801"></a>Octaeteris  was used in <a id="l802"></a>Greece before the reign of Sesak it being the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n39-ref">[39]</sup> Annus magnus of <a id="l803"></a>Cadmus &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n40-ref">[40]</sup> Minos &amp; being <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n41-ref">[41]</sup> used in many religions of Greece &amp; <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n42-ref">[42]</sup> in <a id="l804"></a>celebrating the Ludi Pythica at Delphos. And therefore it may be <a id="l805"></a>accounted as old as those religions &amp; festivals &amp; by consequence <a id="l806"></a>brought into Greece by the first Phenicians &amp; Egyptians who sailed <a id="l807"></a>thither such as were Cadmus &amp; Cecrops. For Herodotus tells us <a id="l808"></a>that the Greeks had their Festivals &amp; Oracles from Egypt &amp; Festus <a id="l809"></a>Avienus seems to attribute a regulation of the year to Cecrops <a id="l810"></a>where speaking of the Enneateris of Harpalus turned into the <a id="l811"></a>Enneadecaeteris by Meton he saith</p>

</div>
<p id="par60">The Octaeteris of the Greeks seems  to have been formed <a id="l812"></a>at first by adding a month to every other year excepting <a id="l813"></a>once in eight years. For it appears our of Herodotus, Censorinus <a id="l814"></a>&amp; Geminus that the old Greek years were alternately of twelve 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span>
and thirteen months. Two of these years therefore made the <a id="l815"></a>Dieteris of the ancients consisting three times of 25 Lunar <a id="l816"></a>Months &amp; once of 24, &amp; four of them made the Tetraeteris <a id="l817"></a>consisting of 49 &amp; 50 lunar months alternately &amp; the omission <a id="l818"></a>of the  intercalary month every eighth year made <a id="l819"></a>the Octaeeris consisting of 99 lunar months. For the months <a id="l820"></a>of these periods were certainly lunar &amp; the years were solar. <a id="l821"></a>For <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n43-ref">[43]</sup> Solon commanded the Athenians to count the days by the <a id="l822"></a>Moon &amp; called the day of conjunction ἐνὴν καὶ νέαν the <a id="l823"></a>old &amp; the new &amp;, referring to the old month that part of the <a id="l824"></a>day which preceded the conjunction &amp; the rest of the day to the <a id="l825"></a>new month. And <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n44-ref">[44]</sup> Geminus tells us that all the ancient Greeks <a id="l826"></a>by their laws &amp; the dictates of their Oracles made their years <a id="l827"></a>agree with the Sun &amp; their months &amp; days of the month <a id="l828"></a>with the course of the Moon so that the same sacrifices <a id="l829"></a>might always fall upon the same seasons of the year &amp; upon the same days of the Lunar Month, &amp; that they accounted this acceptable &amp; gratefull to the Gods, &amp; according to the institutions of their country. <a id="l830"></a>And <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n45-ref">[45]</sup> Cicero saith that the Sicilians &amp; other Greeks to make <a id="l831"></a>their days &amp; months agree with the courses of the Sun &amp; <a id="l832"></a>Moon sometimes took away a day or two from the month <a id="l833"></a>&amp; sometimes made the month  longer by one <a id="l834"></a>or two days. And <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n46-ref">[46]</sup> Censorinus that the several ancient na<a id="l835"></a>tions of  Italy had several years but all of them <a id="l836"></a>by months variously intercalated corrected their civil years <a id="l837"></a>by that one true natural year.</p>
<p id="par61">When the ancients were to reccon times past or to come <a id="l838"></a>or were to summ up the days or months in any number of years <a id="l839"></a>in doing of which they could have no assistance from the Sun <a id="l840"></a>&amp; Moon they  were necessitated to take a certain number of days for a Lunar Month &amp; a certain number of months for a Solar year. And so taking the next round numbers of 30 days to a month &amp; 12 months to a year they formed a notional &amp; chronological year convenient for computations &amp; exact enough for such purposes as they applied it to And according to this way of recconing <a id="l844"></a>they supposed the Luni-Solar year to consist of 360 days, not <a id="l845"></a>yet knowing the true length of it, &amp; divided the Zodiac <a id="l846"></a>into twelve signes &amp; every signe into 30 parts or degrees <a id="l847"></a>so that a degree might answer to the Sun's motion in a <a id="l848"></a>day. And this seems to have been the original of dividing <a id="l849"></a>a circle into 360 degrees. But it is not to be supposed <a id="l850"></a>that any nation used such years or months  for <a id="l851"></a>keeping a recconing of time in civil affairs. For the beginning <a id="l852"></a>of such a year would in seventy years have run round the four <a id="l853"></a>seasons of the  solar year &amp; thereby have discovered the <a id="l854"></a>difference between this year &amp; the solar year much sooner then <a id="l855"></a>it was known: And months of 30 days would in a year or two <a id="l856"></a>have notoriously disagreed from the course of the Moon. When <a id="l857"></a>therefore Moses Herodotus &amp; others reccon by Months of 30 days or <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017r"> &lt;17r&gt; </span> Geminus tells us that the months of the ancients con<a id="l858"></a>sisted of thirty days they are to be understood of the <a id="l859"></a> chronological months. And if the ancient at any time applied <a id="l860"></a>these months to civil uses it is to be conceived that they <a id="l861"></a>corrected them perpetually by the Moon making them <a id="l862"></a>shorter or longer by a day or two &amp; adding a month to the year as often as the course <a id="l863"></a>of the Moon &amp; seasons required, so that their months &amp; years <a id="l864"></a>might constantly agree with the heavens.    This is plain from Herodotus who in recconing the age of man uses the Chronological year  of 12 months &amp; 360 days &amp; then adds that every other year was made longer by a month that the seasons might answer. The 12 months corrected by  the Moon made but 354 days &amp; to complete the year a 13<sup>th</sup> was added as often as the seasons required. And this seems to have been the state of the year in the first <a id="l866"></a>ages before the invention of  Astronomical <a id="l867"></a>rules. But after they found out the rules of intercaling <a id="l868"></a>three months in eight years  &amp; recconing by months of 29 &amp; 30 <a id="l870"></a>days alternately for two years together, they became able <a id="l871"></a>to keep a recconing of time without correcting the reccon<a id="l872"></a>ing by the heavens above once in two four or eight <a id="l873"></a>years  &amp; the Greeks (Cleostratus, Democritus, Philolaus, Harpalus, Eudoxus, Meton Calippus &amp; others) by further experi<a id="l874"></a>ience mended the rules they found out the Ennea<a id="l875"></a>decaeteris, whereby they became able to publish Almanachs <a id="l876"></a>or Calenders of time for nineteen years to come, &amp; a while after by the cycle of Calippus for 76 years to come.</p>
<p id="par62">But in doing these things the Greeks received light <a id="l877"></a>from the Egyptians. For Strabo<sup class="note" id="n47-ref">[47]</sup> tells us that <em class="underline">Eudoxus <a id="l878"></a>staying with Plato thirteen years in Egypt learnt there <a id="l879"></a>of the Priests how much the year was longer then 365 days: for till then</em>, saith Strabo, <em class="underline">the year was unknown <a id="l880"></a>to the Greeks as were also many other things untill the <a id="l881"></a>later Astronomers received them from the Priests of <a id="l882"></a>Egypt, as they still continue to receive from them and <a id="l883"></a>the Chaldeans</em>.</p>
<p id="par63">The Egyptians were therefore the first who found <a id="l884"></a>out the true length of the year. For  <a id="l885"></a>long before these Rules of the Greeks were found out, while <a id="l886"></a>the nations used to count only the age of the Moon &amp; upon <a id="l887"></a>the appearance of every new Moon to begin a new reccon<a id="l888"></a>ing, the Egyptians contrived by the solemnity of the milk <a id="l889"></a>bowles to count all the 360 days of which the year was <a id="l890"></a>reputed to consist &amp; by repeating the recconing found this <a id="l891"></a>year too short. This ceremony being performed with morn<a id="l892"></a>ing &amp; lamentation  in the sepulchre of Osiris was doubtless <a id="l893"></a>a funeral rite in honour to his memory. For  <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n48-ref">[48]</sup> Sayches <a id="l894"></a>or Sesak, who is Osiris taught Astronomy &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n49-ref">[49]</sup> Hyperion who is <a id="l895"></a>also Osiris  is said to have found out the motions of the Sun &amp; Moon <a id="l896"></a>&amp; other stars &amp; the seasons &amp; distinctions of time measured <a id="l897"></a>by them, &amp; afterwards to have imparted his knowledge to others <a id="l898"></a>And therefore he was called the father of those Planets as <a id="l899"></a>being the first that taught the knowledge &amp; nature of them.<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n50-ref">[50]</sup> 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span>
And Mercury who instituted the funeral rites of Osiris was also <a id="l900"></a>an Astronomer, &amp; therefore a fit person to celebrate Osiris for <a id="l901"></a>his skill in that science. Before this institution Astronomy <a id="l902"></a>was in its infancy. For Ammon whom the Atlantides call Vranus measured the year by the course of the Sun &amp; the months by the course of the Moon &amp; while men recconed only by Lunar <a id="l903"></a>Months &amp; by summers &amp; winters &amp; knew not the just num<a id="l904"></a>ber of  days in the solar year but supposed them <a id="l905"></a>to be 360, the motions of the Planets could not be computed <a id="l906"></a>for want of knowing the just number <a id="l907"></a>of days between the Observations. And therefore its very <a id="l908"></a>probable that the Astronomers of Egypt intended by the <a id="l909"></a>solemnity of the milk bowles to found a new Æra for keep<a id="l910"></a>ing an exact reconning of time by years of 360 days &amp; in <a id="l911"></a>honour to the great Osiris dated this Æra from his Apotheosis &amp; appointed <a id="l912"></a>Priests to keep the recconing in one of his Temples.</p>
<p id="par64">But the Egyptians soon finding this year too short added <a id="l913"></a>five days to the end of it &amp; in memory of the addition formed <a id="l914"></a>the fable that Rhea being with child by Saturn, the Sun <a id="l915"></a>prayed that she might not be delivered in any month nor in <a id="l916"></a>the year. Then Mercury won from Luna at Dice the two <a id="l917"></a>&amp; sixtieth part of every day which in the whole year made <a id="l918"></a>up five days &amp; added those five days to the 360 &amp; these five days the Egyptians celebrate as the birth days of Osiris, Isis, Orus senior, Typhon &amp; Nephthe the wife of Typhō. This rea<a id="l919"></a>son they give why Mercury made the Lunary year shorter <a id="l920"></a>&amp; the Solary year longer then the  former year of 360 days <a id="l921"></a>For they ascribe all their inventions to Mercury. And while <a id="l922"></a>they tell us that this addition was made when Rhea was with <a id="l923"></a>child by Saturn that her children (Osiris, Isis, &amp;c) might be born on those days they discover the time of the addition, <a id="l924"></a></p>
<p id="par65">Tis agreed that this alteration was first made by the <a id="l925"></a>Egyptians. So Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n51-ref">[51]</sup>: <em class="underline">The Egyptians  first of all <a id="l926"></a>men invented the year &amp; distinguished it into 12  months &amp; <a id="l927"></a>found out this by the stars. In this also they seem to act <a id="l928"></a>more prudently then the Greeks. They intercale every other <a id="l929"></a>year to make the seasons return, but the Egyptians to the 12 months of 30 days each <a id="l930"></a>add yearly 5 days</em>. Syncellus<sup class="note" id="n52-ref">[52]</sup> ascribes this alteration to <a id="l931"></a>Assis the six king of the Shepherds. <em class="underline">He</em>, saith Syncellus, <em class="underline">added <a id="l932"></a>the five additional days to the year &amp; under him, as they <a id="l933"></a>say, the Egyptian year acquired 365 days which before was <a id="l934"></a>measured only by 360</em>. But that the rude &amp; ignorant <a id="l935"></a>Shepherds should make this alteration or that this victo<a id="l936"></a>rious kings of Thebais should receive the year of their <a id="l937"></a>enemies not likely. The people of Thebais challenged <a id="l938"></a>this year as their own invention. <em class="underline">They</em>. saith Diodorus, <em class="underline">affirm <a id="l939"></a>that Philosophy &amp; the exacter knowledge of the stars <a id="l940"></a>was found out by them, the situation of their land <a id="l941"></a>helping them to observe the risings &amp; settings of the stars <a id="l942"></a>&amp; that they ordered the months &amp; years after a particular <a id="l943"></a>manner by the course of the sun without regard to the <a id="l944"></a>course of the Moon, counting 30 days to a month &amp; 12 <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span> months &amp; five days to a year</em>. By the fable of the Egyp<a id="l945"></a>ians that when Rhea was with child by Saturn, or according <a id="l946"></a>to Diodorus, when Iuno was with child by Iupiter these five <a id="l947"></a>days were added that their children might be born in no part <a id="l948"></a>of the old year &amp; then Iuno brought forth Osiris, Isis,  Orus senior, <a id="l949"></a>Typhon &amp; Nephthe on these five days,  &amp; here by this emendation of the year is <a id="l950"></a>ascribed to Ammon the father of Osiris &amp; Isis,  which brings <a id="l951"></a>us neare the truth. The monuments of the milk bowles &amp; <a id="l952"></a>golden border (which I had rather trust) ascribe it to the <a id="l953"></a>younger Ammon or Amenophis whom the Greeks call Memnon: <a id="l954"></a> If the five additional days were at their first institution consecrated to the Gods Osiris, Isis, Orus senior, Typhon &amp; Nephthe, the institution must be after those Gods were born &amp; most probably after they were dead &amp; deified &amp; become the Dij pœnates of Memnon. And even the year it self by its epocha points at Memnon for the author.</p>
<p id="par66">The first ages counting their years by returns of <a id="l955"></a>summer &amp; winter seed time &amp; harvest &amp; minding the  products <a id="l956"></a>of the earth would be apt to end their year with the <a id="l957"></a>ingathering of the ripe fruits of the earth &amp; begin the next <a id="l958"></a>year with gardening &amp; tillage pruning setting &amp; sowing in <a id="l959"></a>order to  a new crop &amp; ingathering, referring to one &amp; the <a id="l960"></a>same year the whole growth of all the fruits of that year. <a id="l961"></a>Hence the oldest years of the Greeks began in winter &amp; <a id="l962"></a>the year which the Hebrews used in Egypt began in Autumn <a id="l963"></a>&amp; so did the year of the people of Asia minor,  the old year of the Romans. the Æra Seleucidarum Alexandræa, Antiochena <a id="l964"></a>&amp; Arabica. But upon new occasions the Epochas have been <a id="l965"></a>changed from winter to summer &amp; from Autumn to Spring. <a id="l966"></a>So Moses changed the beginning of the Iewish year. And <a id="l967"></a>so the Egyptians might change the beginning of theirs. <a id="l968"></a>And if the Egyptians began their new year of 365 days at either <a id="l969"></a>of the Equinoxes at its first institution, it was either insti<a id="l970"></a>tuted by Memnon or was older then Moses. If at first it <a id="l971"></a>began at the autumnal Equinox it was an hundred years <a id="l972"></a>older then Moses: if at the rising of the Dog-star (as some think) it was 300 years older then Sesak, &amp; on this <a id="l973"></a>ground Syncellus seems to ascribe it to the Shepherds: <a id="l974"></a>but if at first it began at the Vernal Equinox (for almost all nations began their years at one of the cardinal points) then <a id="l975"></a>it is just as old as the latter end of the reign of Memnon <a id="l976"></a>For this Egyptian year was the same with the year of <a id="l977"></a>Nabonassar &amp; began always on the same day &amp; therefore <a id="l978"></a>in the year of the Iulian Period 3821 (&amp; for three years <a id="l979"></a>after) it began on the third of April which was then the <a id="l980"></a>first day after the Vernal Equinox according to the Sun's <a id="l981"></a>mean motion, &amp; that year of the Iulian Period was 55 <a id="l982"></a>years after the overthrow of the Ethiopians by Asa, which I <a id="l983"></a>reccon within the compass of the reign of Amenophis. <a id="l984"></a>For his reign in Ethiopia &amp; wars in Asia &amp;  stay at <a id="l985"></a>Susa &amp; ensuing works in Egypt make him long lived after <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span> that victory. Damis <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> saith that he died in Ethiopia (so he calles <a id="l986"></a>Thebais) after he had reigned five generations, &amp; its probable <a id="l987"></a>that he minded not Astronomy till after his wars &amp; return <a id="l988"></a>from Susa. In the Canons Menes (who is this king) is said to <a id="l989"></a>have reigned 62 years. Censorinus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n54-ref">[54]</sup> tells us, novissime Armi<a id="l990"></a>non ad tridecim menses &amp; dies quinque annum Ægypium <a id="l991"></a>produxisse. Here thirteen months should be 12 (as Scaliger &amp; <a id="l992"></a>Salmasius note) &amp; Arminon should be Ammonem or Ame<a id="l993"></a>nophen.</p>
<p id="par67">Whilst Amenophes noted the rising &amp; setting of the <a id="l994"></a>stars on the days of the year markt out on the golden <a id="l995"></a>border it shews that Astronomers had already given names to <a id="l996"></a>the stars by the help of Constellations, &amp; that they determined <a id="l997"></a>the length of the year by their heliacal risings &amp; settings <a id="l998"></a>It shews also that they did not yet know that this year was <a id="l999"></a>too short by a quarter of a day so as in every four years to <a id="l1000"></a>make the stars change the days of their heliacal rising &amp; <a id="l1001"></a>setting. For had they known this, as they would have done <a id="l1002"></a>if this year had been older then the reign of Amenophis, <a id="l1003"></a>they would not have noted the rising &amp; setting of the stars <a id="l1004"></a>on certain days of this year in a monument which was de<a id="l1005"></a>signed to be lasting. Astronomy was therefore then in <a id="l1006"></a>its infancy &amp; may reccon Ammon Sesak &amp; Amenophis its <a id="l1007"></a>founders.</p>
<p id="par68">Afterwards the Egyptians by continuing to observe <a id="l1008"></a>the rising &amp; setting of the stars found that this year <a id="l1009"></a>was too short by a quarter of a day, that is by a year <a id="l1010"></a>in 1460 natural years &amp; thence formed the Annus <a id="l1011"></a>magnus of 1461 Egyptian years in which time the be<a id="l1012"></a>ginning of their year ran round the Zodiac. This great <a id="l1013"></a>year was called Annus Sothiacus, the Canicular year <a id="l1014"></a>because they determined its length by the rising of the <a id="l1015"></a>stars &amp; principally by the rising of the Dog star called <a id="l1016"></a>Sothis in their language. And therefore they had not yet <a id="l1017"></a>found out the difference between the solar &amp; siderial <a id="l1018"></a>year nor the Precession of the Equinox.</p>
<p id="par69">This year of 365 days the Babylonians received from <a id="l1019"></a>the Egyptians, &amp; the Persians  from the Babylonians.  Whence it came to the Armenians &amp; Syrians. It was received also by the Greeks in the Æra Philippæa dated from the death of Alexander. And Iulius Cæsar corrected it by adding a day in <a id="l1024"></a>every four years &amp; made it the year of the Romans, <a id="l1025"></a>which year is too long by a week in nine hundred years, &amp; may be corrected without disturbing the Dominical Letter or perplexing Chronology, by omitting a week at the end of every nine hundred years.</p>
<p id="par70">By the unanimous tradition of the Greeks Memnon was <a id="l1026"></a>contemporary to the sons of Priam. They tell us that he was the <a id="l1027"></a>son of Aurora &amp; Tithonus the brother of Priam &amp;  <a id="l1028"></a>Homer Pindar Pausanias Diodorus &amp; others say that he came to <a id="l1029"></a>the war at Troy &amp; was there slain by Achilles. If about the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021r"> &lt;21r&gt; </span>  
time of that war or immediately after he came into Phrygia <a id="l1030"></a>not to assist the Trojans but in carrying on his conquests, this <a id="l1031"></a>might give occasion to the Greeks to report him slain by their <a id="l1032"></a>Hero: but if he had not lived in that age there could have <a id="l1033"></a>been no pretence for the story. Pausanias relates that in a <a id="l1034"></a>publick building at Delphos he saw several pictures made <a id="l1035"></a>by Polygnotus (a famous old Painter contemporary to Arta<a id="l1036"></a>xerxes Longimanus) &amp; that in one of them were painted <a id="l1037"></a>Hector Memnon &amp; Sarpedon all of them with beards &amp; <a id="l1038"></a>Paris a beardless young man &amp; by Memnon was painted a <a id="l1039"></a>naked Ethiopian boy. And, saith Pausanias, <em class="underline">Memnon came to <a id="l1040"></a>the war of Troy not from Ethiopia but from Susa a city <a id="l1041"></a>of Persia conquering all the intermediate nations as far as <a id="l1042"></a>the river Choaspis. And the Phrygians still shew by what <a id="l1043"></a>way he led his army, the way being distinguished by mansions</em>. <a id="l1044"></a>In memory of this expedition the Nicomedians kept in the <a id="l1045"></a>Temple of Æesculapius a copper sword which they said was <a id="l1046"></a>Memnon's. It was an old monument because made of copper <a id="l1047"></a>the metal of which the Greeks &amp; Trojans then made their <a id="l1048"></a>weapons. Since Memnon is  feigned to be the son of Tithonus <a id="l1049"></a>if we may suppose him born when Tithonus went captive <a id="l1050"></a>into Thebais, he might be about 26 years old when he <a id="l1051"></a>retired from Memphys into Ethiopia, 40 when he drave <a id="l1052"></a>the Iews out of Egypt 50 or 55 when he came from <a id="l1053"></a>Susa into Asia minor conquering all the nations before <a id="l1054"></a>him &amp; 74 when he constituted the new year of 365 <a id="l1055"></a>days.</p>
<p id="par71">Between Osimandes &amp; Miris (i. e. Memnon &amp; Mæris) Diodorus<sup class="note" id="n55-ref">[55]</sup> <a id="l1056"></a>places one Vchoreus &amp; says that he built Memphys &amp; fortified <a id="l1057"></a>it to admiration with a mighty rampart of earth &amp; a broad &amp; <a id="l1058"></a>deep trench which was filled with the water of the Nile, &amp; <a id="l1059"></a>built Palaces in it, &amp; that this place was so commodiously <a id="l1060"></a>pitche upon  by the builder that most of the kings <a id="l1061"></a>who reigned after him preferred it before Thebes &amp; removed <a id="l1062"></a>the court thence to this place so that the magnificence of <a id="l1063"></a>Thebes from that time began to decrease &amp; Memphys to <a id="l1064"></a>increase till Alexander king of Macedon built  <a id="l1065"></a>Alexandria. By these works I take Vchoreus to be either <a id="l1066"></a>Memnon himself or one of his Princes. For the Deputy <a id="l1067"></a>Governours of Egypt are sometimes recconed amongst the <a id="l1068"></a>Kings.</p>
<p id="par72">For amongst the kings of Egypt Herodotus reccons Proteus <a id="l1069"></a>&amp; places him next after Pheron the successor of Sesostris, but <a id="l1070"></a>Proteus seems rather to have been a Viceroy set over the <a id="l1071"></a>lower Egypt then a sovereign king. For<sup class="note" id="n56-ref">[56]</sup> he was a Memphyte <a id="l1072"></a>of ignoble extraction &amp; reigned at Memphys. Conon<sup class="note" id="n57-ref">[57]</sup> calls him an Egyptian Prophet, that is a Priest. And the name <a id="l1073"></a>Proteus being a Greek word which signifies a chief man <a id="l1074"></a>or Prince seems to be not the proper name of a man but <a id="l1075"></a>a title of honour. For had it been a proper name the Greeks 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022r"> &lt;22r&gt; </span>
would have retained the Egyptian word without translating <a id="l1076"></a>it whereas Herodotus tells us that it is the kings name in <a id="l1077"></a>Greek, that is a Greek word of the same signification <a id="l1078"></a>with his name or title in the Egyptian language, &amp; Dio<a id="l1079"></a>dorus tells us that this man's name was Cetes. There <a id="l1080"></a>were several Princes of Egypt called Proteus, one of which <a id="l1081"></a>fled from Busiris king of Egypt &amp; came with Cadmus into <a id="l1082"></a> Europe. And it's probable that the frequent chang<a id="l1083"></a>ing of the person might give occasion to the Greeks to <a id="l1084"></a>feign that Proteus put on all shapes. Some make him a Phe<a id="l1085"></a>nician reigning neare Pharus where Alexandria was afterward <a id="l1086"></a>built, as Tzetzes<sup class="note" id="n58-ref">[58]</sup></p>

<p id="par73" class="i0">And this agrees best with his being a God of the Sea. But the Proteus <a id="l1087"></a>of Herodotus reigned in Memphys &amp; left a sumptuous Temple <a id="l1088"></a>there to the south of the Temple of Vulcan. In this Temple <a id="l1089"></a>was the house of Venus Hospita by which name Herodotus <a id="l1090"></a>conjectured that Helena the daughter of Tyndarus was meant, <a id="l1091"></a>having heard that she stayed in Egypt with Proteus &amp; was <a id="l1092"></a>called Venus Hospita &amp; being told so by the Priests of Egypt. <a id="l1093"></a>For when Alexander stole her from her husband Mene<a id="l1094"></a>laus &amp; fled with her from Greece he was driven with <a id="l1095"></a>her upon the coast of Egypt, &amp; Thonis the governour of <a id="l1096"></a>the Port suspecting him sent him to Proteus at Memphys <a id="l1097"></a>&amp; Proteus examining the matter deteined Helena (as Herodo<a id="l1098"></a>tus relates) &amp; sent home Alexander. Then the Greeks de<a id="l1099"></a>manding her of the Trojans made war upon Troy thinking that <a id="l1100"></a>Alexander had carried her thither, but after the destructi<a id="l1101"></a>on of Troy Menelaus went for her into Egypt. And to <a id="l1102"></a>this history, saith Herodotus, Homer alludes in mentioning the <a id="l1103"></a>errors of Paris with Helena by sea upon the coast of Sidon <a id="l1104"></a>before the war &amp; the voyage of Menelaus into Egypt <a id="l1105"></a>after it. According to this story the Proteus of Herodotus <a id="l1106"></a>reigned in the time of the Trojan war &amp; therefore governed <a id="l1107"></a>the lower Egypt under Amenophis or Memnon. However <a id="l1108"></a>since the Temples of Vulcan &amp; Venus Hospita  <a id="l1109"></a>stood together &amp; were built at the same time, I take her <a id="l1110"></a>to be Vulcans wife. Cinyras had furnished Memnon with <a id="l1111"></a>armour for his wars &amp; for this benefaction Memnon honoured <a id="l1112"></a>him after death with a very sumptuous Temple in Memphys <a id="l1113"></a>&amp; Proteus built another by it to the Cyprian Queen.</p>
<p id="par74">Next after Amenophis reigned his son Ramesses, Rameses <a id="l1114"></a>or Rhampses above mentioned. Herodotus calls him Rhampsinitus <a id="l1115"></a>&amp; saith he was the successor of Proteus. Diodorus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n59-ref">[59]</sup> calls him <a id="l1116"></a>Rhemphis &amp; saith he was the son &amp;successor of Proteus. Pliny <a id="l1117"></a>tells us <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n60-ref">[60]</sup> that in his reign Troy was taken: for he reigned first 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023r"> &lt;23r&gt; </span>    
under his father as you heard above &amp; then alone. In Helio<a id="l1118"></a>polis he placed the biggest Obelisk in all Egypt which the <a id="l1119"></a>Emperor Constantius removed to Rome. The <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n61-ref">[61]</sup> inscription <a id="l1120"></a>upon it as interpreted by Hermapion stiles him king of the <a id="l1121"></a>world &amp; represents him reigning over the whole world &amp; over <a id="l1122"></a>all the earth &amp; that the Gods had given him a long life: <a id="l1123"></a>which shews that he survived his father &amp; inherited <a id="l1124"></a>from him a very large &amp; flourishing kingdom. He did <a id="l1125"></a>nothing glorious but<sup class="note" id="n62-ref">[62]</sup> spent his  whole age in heaping <a id="l1126"></a>up wealth &amp; was the richest of all the Kings &amp; left more <a id="l1127"></a>wealth behind him then any of them. For he gathered <a id="l1128"></a>in gold &amp; silver 400000 talents, an Egyptian talent <a id="l1129"></a>being two Attic ones that is 120 Attic pounds.

<p id="par77">In the Canons Suphis the founder of the greatest <a id="l1207"></a>Pyramid is put the successor of Soris, Saophis of Ayres or <a id="l1208"></a>Biyres &amp; Siphoas or Siphaosis or Anoyphis of Maris. All which is <a id="l1209"></a>as much as to say that Mæris was succeeded by  Suphis <a id="l1210"></a>the founder of the greatest Pyramid otherwise called Saophis, <a id="l1211"></a>Siphoas, Siphaosis, Anoyphis. The builder of that Pyramid <a id="l1212"></a>is by Herodotus called Cheops the word Saophis being <a id="l1213"></a>changed into Cheophis or Cheops by the alteration of a <a id="l1214"></a>letter. Whence Mæris is rightly placed between Rhamp<a id="l1215"></a>sinitus &amp; Cheops. In the Canons he is also called Phiops <a id="l1216"></a>&amp; Apappus maximus. Diodorus calls the builder of the <a id="l1217"></a>greatest Pyramid Chemnis or Chembis changing Cheoph <a id="l1218"></a>into Chembis much after the manner that the Greeks <a id="l1219"></a>change Moph into Memphis. Herodotus tells us that <a id="l1220"></a>right &amp; justice obteined in Egypt untill King Rhampsi<a id="l1221"></a>nitus, but his successor Cheops lapsed into all  <a id="l1222"></a>wickedness shutting up the Temples, interdicting the <a id="l1223"></a>sacrifices &amp; imploying  not the captives but the Egyptians in <a id="l1224"></a> his works. Among the righteous kings Mæris is in<a id="l1225"></a>cluded &amp; should have been placed the last of them. In <a id="l1226"></a>shutting up the Temples &amp; abolishing the sacrifices the <a id="l1227"></a>designe of Cheops seems to have been the abolishing the <a id="l1228"></a>worship &amp; memory of the former kings that his own <a id="l1229"></a>might be had in the greater honour. For how <a id="l1230"></a>desirous he was to be honoured after death appears by <a id="l1231"></a>his building so great a Pyramid for that purpose a work <a id="l1232"></a>in which he imployed 100000 men for 20 years together. <a id="l1233"></a>He was a merchant &amp; contemplator of the Gods &amp; was <a id="l1234"></a>called Mercury. But since he interdicted the worship of <a id="l1235"></a>the Theban Gods he was not the second Mercury who translated the Hiero<a id="l1236"></a>glyphic inscriptions of the first Mercury into books &amp; placed them <a id="l1237"></a>in the Temples. I had rather say that as the first Mercu<a id="l1238"></a>ry was secretary of State to Osiris the  founder of the Monar<a id="l1239"></a>chy at Thebes so the second Mercury was secretary of State <a id="l1240"></a>to Menes the founder of the monarchy at Memphys, &amp; that this <a id="l1241"></a>secretary was Athothes the Physitian who wrote of Anatomy <a id="l1242"></a>&amp; in the Canons is made the successor of Menes. In such a <a id="l1243"></a>sense as the first Mercury reigned after Osiris the second <a id="l1244"></a>reigned after Menes that is as a Viceroy or Proteus or <a id="l1245"></a>chief secretary of state.</p>

<p id="par80">Asychis the  next king of Egypt made the very <a id="l1262"></a>large &amp; beautiful eastern Portico of the Temple of <a id="l1263"></a>Vulcan &amp; a brick Pyramid with an inscription signify<a id="l1264"></a>ing that it excelled the other Pyramids as much as Iu<a id="l1265"></a>piter did the other Gods because made of clay fetched <a id="l1266"></a>from the bottom of a Lake with a long staff.</p>
<p id="par81">And besides these Pyramids there were about 18 others <a id="l1267"></a>neare the Mummies one of which is recconed by Greaves <a id="l1268"></a>to be equal to the greatest of the three neare Memphis, <a id="l1269"></a>but the most of them were much smaller. The small <a id="l1270"></a>ones seem to be Pyramids which Enephes or Venephes (that is <a id="l1271"></a>Amenophis) built in Cochone. The ancient kings of Thebes <a id="l1272"></a>seem to have been buried together in Tombs cut out in a rock <a id="l1273"></a>neare Thebes till Amenophis built a Temple for his sepulchre <a id="l1274"></a>but after he &amp; Mæris brought Pyramids into fashion the follow<a id="l1275"></a>ing kings built them still bigger &amp; seem to have spent their time <a id="l1276"></a>&amp; revenues in these more lasting monuments for themselves <a id="l1277"></a>their wives &amp; children. The building of Pyramids depended <a id="l1278"></a>on a particular humour of the Egyptians, then in fashion <a id="l1279"></a>&amp; therefore they were all built much about the same time <a id="l1280"></a>&amp; the gradual bigness of them shews in what order the kings <a id="l1281"></a>reigned who built them, the smaller Pyramids being built <a id="l1282"></a>before the greater came into fashion.</p>
<p id="par82">After these kings reigned Gnephachthus &amp; his son <a id="l1283"></a>Boccharis successively at Memphys, &amp; Anysis in the lower <a id="l1284"></a>Egypt most probably at Tanis or Zoan. Gnephachthus (called <a id="l1285"></a>also Neochabis Nectabis &amp; Technatis) leading an army into Arabia<sup class="note" id="n68-ref">[68]</sup> through <a id="l1286"></a>desart places, his provision failed so that he was fain to take <a id="l1287"></a>up with such mean food as he could then be supplied with <a id="l1288"></a>which he relished so heartily that he forbad all excess &amp; luxury <a id="l1289"></a>&amp; cursed Menes who first brought in a sumptuous &amp; luxu<a id="l1290"></a>rious way of living &amp; caused the curse to be cut on a pillar <a id="l1291"></a>&amp; placed on the Temple of Iupiter Hammon at Thebes, which <a id="l1292"></a>made the fame &amp; reputation of Menes to be clouded in <a id="l1293"></a>future generations.

<p id="par83">Africanus mentions some kings reigning about this time at <a id="l1301"></a>Tanis, videlicet 1 Petubastes in whose days according to Africanus the <a id="l1302"></a>Olympiads began to be celebrated. 2 Osorchon whom the Egyptians <a id="l1303"></a>call Hercules. 3 Psammis whose reign according to Eusebius be<a id="l1304"></a>gan with the 36<sup>th</sup> year of Azarias king of Iudah, that is <a id="l1305"></a>with the Olympiads. 4 Zet........ Anysis was either the <a id="l1306"></a>last of this race of kings or reigned in some other city in the <a id="l1307"></a>lower Egypt. He was blind &amp; in his reign &amp; the reign of <a id="l1308"></a>Boccharis, Sabadon the Ethiopian invaded &amp; conquered <a id="l1309"></a>Egypt, took Boccharis &amp; burnt him alive &amp; made Anysis <a id="l1310"></a>fly into the  fenny places of Egypt neare Abaris <a id="l1311"></a>where he lay hid for some time in the Island Elbo. <a id="l1312"></a>Sabacon punished none with death but condemned offenders to <a id="l1313"></a>carry earth to the cities of Egypt for raising them higher <a id="l1314"></a>by which means he raised them much higher then Sesostris <a id="l1315"></a>had done before.  Anysis &amp; Sabacon are <a id="l1316"></a>by Diodorus called Amosis &amp; Actisanes. Amosis was cruel &amp; put many to death for which reason his subjects upon the <a id="l1317"></a>invasion of Actisanes revolted from him so that he was <a id="l1318"></a>easily conquered. Actisanes was mercifull &amp; obliging to his <a id="l1319"></a>subjects &amp; instead of putting robbers to death cut off their <a id="l1320"></a>noses &amp; banished them into a desart place between Egypt <a id="l1321"></a>&amp; Syria which from these robbers with cut noses was called <a id="l1322"></a>Rhinocolura.</p>
<p id="par84">Isaias  speaking of the times preceding the reign of <a id="l1323"></a>Sabacon mentions these two kingdoms seated at Zoan or Tanis <a id="l1324"></a>&amp; Noph or Memphis.<sup class="note" id="n71-ref">[71]</sup> <em class="underline">I will set</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">the Egyptians <a id="l1325"></a>against the Egyptians &amp; they shall fight every one against <a id="l1326"></a>his brother &amp; every one against his neighbour city against <a id="l1327"></a>city &amp; kingdom against kingdom &amp; the spirit of Egypt shall <a id="l1328"></a>fail. – And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand <a id="l1329"></a>of a cruel Lord</em> [videlicet Sabacon] <em class="underline">&amp; a fierce king shall <a id="l1330"></a>rule over them. – Surely the Princes of Zoan are fools <a id="l1331"></a>the counsell of the wise Counsellours of Pharaoh is become brutish. <a id="l1332"></a>How say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise the <a id="l1333"></a>son of the ancient kings. – The Princes of Zoan are become <a id="l1334"></a>fools, the Princes of Noph are deceived, they have also <a id="l1335"></a>seduced Egypt they that were the stay of the Tribes thereof. <a id="l1336"></a>– In that day there shall be a high way out of Egypt into <a id="l1337"></a>Assyria &amp; the Assyrian shall come into Egypt &amp; the Egyptian <a id="l1338"></a>into Assyria &amp; the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians.</em></p>
<p id="par85">Besides these two kingdoms there was a third at Sais <a id="l1339"></a>where Stephanates Necepsos &amp; Nechus reigned successively. <a id="l1340"></a>Necepsos with one Petosiris is reputed the inventor of judicial 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p028r"> &lt;28r&gt; </span>
Astrology &amp; the first that wrote the art of predicting by <a id="l1341"></a>the stars. Sabacon or one of his successors slew Nechus &amp; <a id="l1342"></a>made his son Psammiticus fly into Syria.</p>
<p id="par86">So then the Monarchy of Egypt in the reign of those <a id="l1343"></a>kings who built the Pyramids became divided into several <a id="l1344"></a>kingdoms at home &amp; by consequence lost its dominion abroad, <a id="l1345"></a>&amp; these kingdoms warred with one another untill they were <a id="l1346"></a>invaded &amp; conquered by the nations which fell off from them <a id="l1347"></a>videlicet first by the Ethiopians under Sabacon &amp; afterwards <a id="l1348"></a>by the Assyrians.</p>
<p id="par87">When Sabacon invaded Egypt a body of Egyptians fled <a id="l1349"></a>into Babylonia. Hestiæus thus mentions this transmigration <a id="l1350"></a><em class="underline">The Priests who escaped</em> (that is who escaped from Sabacon) <a id="l1351"></a><em class="underline">taking the sacra of Iupiter ἐνυάλιος came into Senaar <a id="l1352"></a>a field of Babylonia</em>. Iupiter Enyalius is the God of thunder <a id="l1353"></a>Ammon or Belus Martius. Diodorus describes this transmigration <a id="l1354"></a>more fully saying that <em class="underline">Belus the son of Neptune &amp; Libya <a id="l1355"></a>led a colony into Babylon &amp; placing his seat at Euphrates <a id="l1356"></a>instituted Priests after the manner of the Egyptians ex<a id="l1357"></a>empt from Taxes &amp; public duties, whom the Babylonians <a id="l1358"></a>call Chaldeans &amp; who observe the stars after the example <a id="l1359"></a>of the Priests &amp; Philosophers &amp; Astrologers of Egypt</em>. This <a id="l1360"></a>colony carried with them into Babylonia the Astrology of <a id="l1361"></a>Necepsos &amp; the solar year of the Egyptians &amp; founded the <a id="l1362"></a>Æra of Nabonassar whose years have the very same Thoth <a id="l1363"></a>with the years of Egypt. Whence we may reccon that <a id="l1364"></a>Sabacon invaded Egypt about the time that the Æra of <a id="l1365"></a>Nabonassar began.</p>
<p id="par88">The reign of the Ethiopians over Egypt according to <a id="l1366"></a>Herodotus lasted 50 years &amp; began &amp; ended under Sabacon. But <a id="l1367"></a>in the Dynasties of Africanus Sabacon reigned only eight years <a id="l1368"></a>or according to Eusebius twelve &amp; had two Ethiopian successors <a id="l1369"></a>Seuechus his son who reigned 14 years &amp; Tirhakah who <a id="l1370"></a>reigned 18 or 20. Eusebius &amp; Syncellus add a third successor <a id="l1371"></a>Merres or Ammeres the Ethiopian who reigned 12 years. <a id="l1372"></a>Seueches seems to be Suo or So king of Egypt with whom <a id="l1373"></a>Hoshea king of Israel conspired against the Assyrians in <a id="l1374"></a>the 4<sup>th</sup> year of Hezekiah three years before the captivity <a id="l1375"></a>of the ten Tribes (2 King. 17.4) And Tirhakah was that <a id="l1376"></a>Pharaoh king of Egypt on whom Hezekiah trusted in the 14<sup>th</sup> <a id="l1377"></a>year of his reign when Sennacherib invaded Iudea, &amp; that <a id="l1378"></a>Tirhakah king of Ethiopia who in the same year came out <a id="l1379"></a>against Sennacherib in behalf of Hezekiah (2 King. 18.21, 24 &amp; <a id="l1380"></a>19.9). And therefore Tirhakah succeeded Sua between the 4<sup>th</sup> <a id="l1381"></a>&amp; 14<sup>th</sup> year of Hezekiah, that is between the 24 &amp; 34<sup>th</sup> <a id="l1382"></a>year of Nabonassar. Count backward the 14 years reign of Sua <a id="l1383"></a>&amp; 12 years reign of Sabacon, &amp; the recconing will place Sa<a id="l1384"></a>bacon's  invasion of Egypt in or about the beginning of the <a id="l1385"></a>Æra of Nabonassar </p> 
<span class="pagenumber" id="p029r"> &lt;29r&gt; </span>
<p id="par89">Herodotus giving an account how Sennacherib lost his army saith <a id="l1386"></a>that Sethon Priest of Vulcan was beseiged in Pelusium by Senna<a id="l1387"></a>cherib &amp; freed by mice eating the bowstrings &amp; Quivers of the <a id="l1388"></a>Assyrians &amp; the strings for lying on their armour, &amp; that he saw <a id="l1389"></a>the statue of Sethon holding a mouse in his hand in memory <a id="l1390"></a>of this deliverance. Sethon therefore was not king of Egypt <a id="l1391"></a>but lived in the time of the Ethiopian kingdom. The Assyrians <a id="l1392"></a>by this means being routed with a great slaughter, or as others <a id="l1393"></a>say, dying of a sudden plague, Tirhakah or (as Strabo<sup class="note" id="n72-ref">[72]</sup> calls him) Tearco <a id="l1394"></a>the Ethiopian carried on his victories as far as Europe as Sesak <a id="l1395"></a>had done before him. He went westward as far as the Pillars <a id="l1396"></a>&amp; then led his army out of Spain into Thrace &amp; Pontus. But <a id="l1397"></a>against the successor of Tirhakah Assarhadon the son of <a id="l1398"></a>Sennacherib sent Tartan with an army of Assyrians who <a id="l1399"></a>fought against Ashdod or Azot a town of Palestine neare <a id="l1400"></a>Egypt &amp; took it &amp; afterwards the Assyrians invaded &amp; con<a id="l1401"></a>quered Egypt &amp; led the Ethiopians &amp;Egyptians young &amp; old <a id="l1402"></a>into captivity naked &amp; barefoot &amp; with their buttocks uncovered <a id="l1403"></a>Isa. 20. And about the same time they conquered also the Iews <a id="l1404"></a>&amp; carried Manasses  captive to Babylon 2 Chron. 33.<a id="l1405"></a>11, &amp; Isa. 19.24, 25. Whence I gather that these conquests were <a id="l1406"></a>made after Assarhadon became king of Babylon, that is after <a id="l1407"></a>the year of Nabonassar 67. The Iews say that Manasseh <a id="l1408"></a>was captivated in the 22<sup>th</sup> year of his reign which was the year <a id="l1409"></a>of Nabonassar 71: &amp; Egypt lying beyond Iudea from Assyria may <a id="l1410"></a>be presumed to be conquered afterwards; so that the Ethiopians <a id="l1411"></a>reigned over Egypt about 70 or 75 years before they lost <a id="l1412"></a>their dominion to the Assyrians.</p>
<p id="par90">After the Assyrians had conquered Egypt there was an <a id="l1413"></a>interregnum of two years &amp; then twelve Princes of Egypt by <a id="l1414"></a>consent shared the kingdom amongst themselves &amp; reigned 15 <a id="l1415"></a>years, that is under the Assyrians. One of these Princes <a id="l1416"></a>was Psammiticus above mentioned whom the people of the Sais <a id="l1417"></a>called back from Syria. He reigned at Sais a city upon the <a id="l1418"></a>mouth of the  Canobic stream of the Nile the only Port <a id="l1419"></a>in Egypt, &amp; calling in forreigners from Arabia Caria &amp; <a id="l1420"></a>Ionia to his assistance he subdued the rest of the Princes &amp; <a id="l1421"></a>became king of all Egypt. Afterwards the nations of Phe<a id="l1422"></a>nicia Syria &amp; Cilicia revolted also from the Assyrians. He <a id="l1423"></a>beseiged Azot 29 years together &amp; took it from the Assy<a id="l1424"></a>rians. He was the first that let the Greeks into Egypt where <a id="l1425"></a>he gave them seats. By reason of his army of forreigners a <a id="l1426"></a>body of 200000 Egyptians fled from him &amp; seated themselves <a id="l1427"></a>in Ethiopia above Meroe. He built the southern Porch <a id="l1428"></a>of the Temple of Vulcan in Memphis &amp; over against <a id="l1429"></a>it a Hall for keeping the Ox Apis. He reigned 54 years</p>

And since Solomon <a id="l1478"></a>was Davids second son by Bathsheba, the siege of Rabbah when David first lay <a id="l1479"></a>with Bathsheba will begin at least two years before, &amp; in the two years before that David <a id="l1480"></a>had two great victories over the Ammonites &amp; Syrians so that the war against <a id="l1481"></a>them began in the 13<em class="underline">th</em> year of Davids reign, &amp; the first 12 years of his reign <a id="l1482"></a>were spent in wars with the house of Saul &amp; with the Philistims &amp; Amalakites &amp; <a id="l1483"></a>Edomites &amp; Moabites.

Sethosis therefore returned into Egypt <a id="l1708"></a>about 10 or 20 or at most 30 years before the Argonautic <a id="l1709"></a>expedition &amp; by consequence invaded the nations in the <a id="l1710"></a>reign of Rehoboam, &amp; so can be no other king then Sesak.</p>
<p id="par107">The same thing is confirmed by Iosephus<sup class="note" id="n107-ref">[107]</sup> who  affirms that Herodotus ascribes to Sesostris the actions <a id="l1712"></a>of Sesak erring only in the name of the king. Which is <a id="l1713"></a>all one as to say that Sesak was that conqueror whom Hero<a id="l1714"></a>dotus calls Sesostris. The old Scholiast of Apollonius Rhodius <a id="l1715"></a>calls him Sesonchosis saying that Sesonchosis who  was king of <a id="l1716"></a>all Egypt &amp; reigned after Orus, the son of Osiris &amp; Isis, conquered <a id="l1717"></a>all Asia &amp; a great part of Europe &amp; erected pillars of his <a id="l1718"></a>conquests &amp; made laws &amp; found out horsmanship &amp; left a colony <a id="l1719"></a>at Æa with laws writ in Tables &amp; with geographical Tables of <a id="l1720"></a>his conquests by land &amp; sea, &amp; that Theopompus calls him Sesostris. 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p033v"> &lt;33v&gt; </span>        
Now Sesonchosis, or, as others call him, Sesonchis, is the same name <a id="l1721"></a>with Sesak much after the manner that Memphis is the same <a id="l1722"></a>name with Moph, or that the susanchites (Ezra 4) are the people of Susa <a id="l1723"></a>or Shushan called Sheshach by Ieremiah ch 25 &amp; 51.</p>
