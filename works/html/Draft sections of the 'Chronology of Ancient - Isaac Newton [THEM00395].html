<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Chronological Observations upon the foregoing<a id="l1"></a> Interpretation</h2>
<p id="par1">This Chronology depends principally upon the history of the Iews delivered in the books of Ezra &amp; Nehe<a id="l2"></a>miah.  And this history consists of these parts: the return of the Iews <a id="l3"></a>from captivity &amp; laying the foundation of the Temple in the reign of Cyrus.  the finishing of the Temple in <a id="l4"></a>the reign of Darius, the return of Ezra &amp; his companions from captivity <a id="l5"></a>in the seventh year of Artaxerxes &amp; building of the wall &amp; City by Ne<a id="l6"></a>hemiah soon after.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">1. Of the History of the Iews in the reign of Cyrus  Cambyses. &amp; Darius Hystaspis</h2>
<p id="par2">This history is conteined partly in the three first chapters of the book <a id="l7"></a>of Ezra &amp;  first five verses of the 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; partly in the book of <a id="l8"></a>Nehemiah from the 5<sup>t</sup> vers of the 7<sup>th</sup> chapter to the 9<sup>th</sup> verse of the 12<sup>th</sup> <a id="l9"></a>For Nehemiah copied all this out of the Chronicles of the Iews as may <a id="l10"></a>appear by reading the place &amp; considering that the  Priests &amp; Levites who sealed the <a id="l11"></a>covenant in the 24<sup>th</sup> day of the seventh month were the very same which <a id="l12"></a> those who returned from captivity in the first year of Cyrus &amp; that all those who returned sealed it <a id="l13"></a>This you will perceive by the following comparison of their names.</p>

<p id="par3" class="i0">The Levites Kadmiel &amp; Hodaviah or Iudah here mentioned, are recconed chief fathers among the <a id="l14"></a>people who returned with Zerubbabel  (Ezra 2.40) &amp; they assisted as well <a id="l15"></a>in laying the foundation of the Temple (Ezra 3.9) as in reading of the Law &amp; <a id="l16"></a>making &amp; sealing the Covenant Nehem 8.7 &amp; 9.5 &amp; 10.9, 10.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span>
<p id="par4">Comparing therefore the  books of <a id="l17"></a>Ezra &amp; Nehemiah, the history of the Iews under Cyrus  Cambyses &amp; Darius Hystaspis will be that <a id="l18"></a>they returned from Captivity  under Zerubbabel in the first year of Cyrus with the <a id="l19"></a>holy vessels &amp; a commission to build the Temple &amp; came to Ierusalem &amp; Iudah every one to his City &amp;  dwelt in their cities  till the seventh month &amp; then coming to Ierusalem they first built the Altar &amp; on <a id="l21"></a>the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the 7<sup>th</sup> month began to offer the dayly burnt offerings &amp; read in the book of the law &amp; they <a id="l22"></a>kept the feast of Tabernacles &amp; on the 24<sup>th</sup> day of this month they kept a <a id="l23"></a>solemn fast &amp; sealed a covenant &amp; thenceforward the Rulers of the people dwelt at Ierusa<a id="l24"></a>lem &amp; the rest of the people cast lots to dwell one in ten at Ierusalem &amp; the <a id="l25"></a>rest in the cities of Iudah &amp; in the second year of their coming in the 2<sup>d</sup> <a id="l26"></a>month they laid the foundation of the Temple, but the the adversaries of Iudah <a id="l27"></a>troubled them in building &amp; hired counsellours against them all the days of <a id="l28"></a>Cyrus &amp; [ afterwards, viz<sup>t</sup> the reign of Cambyses] untill the reign of Darius king of Persia. 2. Of the History of the Iews in the reign of Darius Hystaspis. But in <a id="l29"></a>the second year of his reign by the prophesying of Haggai &amp; Zechariah they returned <a id="l30"></a>to the work &amp; by the help of a new Decree from Darius finished it on the 3<sup>d</sup> day of the month Adar in the <a id="l31"></a>sixt year of his reign &amp; kept the Dedication which joy &amp; the Passover &amp; Feast of unleavened bread.</p>
<p id="par5">Now this Darius was not Darius Nothus but Darius Hystaspis as I gather by  considering that the second year of this Darius  was the 70<sup>th</sup> of the desolation of the City <a id="l34"></a>(Zech. 1.12 &amp; 7.5) which is true of Darius Hystaspis &amp; that at that time there were men living who had seen the <a id="l35"></a>first Temple (Haggai 2.3) whereas the second  year of Darius Nothus <a id="l36"></a>was 167 years after the desolation of the City. And further if the finishing of the <a id="l37"></a>Temple be deferred to the sixt year of Darius Nothus, Ieshua &amp; Zerubbabel <a id="l38"></a>must have been the one High Priest the other Capitain of the people for 112 <a id="l39"></a>years together, besides their ages before; which is surely too long. For in the first <a id="l40"></a>year of Cyrus the  chief Priests were Seraiah, Ieremiah, Ezra, Amariah, Malluch, <a id="l41"></a>Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, Iddo, Genetho, Abijah, Miamin, Maadiah, <a id="l42"></a>Bilgah, Shemajah, Iojarib, Iedaiah, Sallu, Amock, Hilkiah, Iedaiah. These <a id="l43"></a>were Priests in the days of Ieshua, and the eldest sons of them all  (Merajah the son of Serajah, Hanamiah the son of Ieremiah <a id="l45"></a>Meshullam the son of Ezra &amp;c) were chief Priests in the days of Ioja<a id="l46"></a>kim the son of Ieshua (Nehem 12) &amp; therefore the High Priesthood of Ie<a id="l47"></a>shua was but of an ordinary length.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="hd3" class="cent">2 Of the History of the Iews in the reign of Xerxes &amp; <a id="l48"></a> Artaxerxes Longimanus.</h2>
<p id="par6">I place the Histories of Ezra &amp; Nehemiah in the reign of this Artax<a id="l49"></a>erxes not in that of Artaxerxes Mnemon. For during all the Persian Mo<a id="l50"></a><br>narchy there were six High Priests in continuall succession of father &amp; <a id="l51"></a>son namely Ieshua, Iojakim, Eliasib, Iojada, Ionathan, Iaddua, &amp; if by an <a id="l52"></a>equal division of the times of their Priesthood there be allotted about <a id="l53"></a>34 years to each, so that all together may take up the whole time <a id="l54"></a>of that Monarchy which stood 200 years the High Priesthood of Eliasib &amp; by consequence the days of Ezra &amp; Nehemiah will <a id="l55"></a>fall in with the reign of the first Artaxerxes. For Ezra &amp; Nehemiah flou<a id="l56"></a>ished in the High Priesthoods of Iojakim &amp; Eliasib Nehem 3.1 &amp; 12.26 &amp; 13.28 <a id="l57"></a>But if Eliasib &amp; Nehemiah be placed in the  reign of the second <a id="l58"></a>Artaxerxes, since they lived beyond the 32<sup>th</sup> year of that King (Nehem 13.<a id="l59"></a>28) there must be at least 157 years allotted to the three first High Priests <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> and but 43 to the five last, a division too unequal. For the High-Priest<a id="l60"></a>hoods of Ieshua Iojakim &amp; Eliasib were but of an ordinary length, that of Ie<a id="l61"></a>shua fell in with one generation of the chief Priests &amp; that of Iojakim <a id="l62"></a>with the next generation (as we have shewed already) &amp; that of Eliasib <a id="l63"></a>fell in with the third generation. For at the dedication of the wall Zecha<a id="l64"></a>riah the son of  Ionathan the son of Shemaiah was  one <a id="l65"></a>of the Priests (Nehem 12.35) &amp; Ionathan &amp; his father Shemaiah were contemporaries to Iojakim &amp; <a id="l66"></a>  his father Ieshua (Nehem. 12.6, 18.) I observe further that in the first year of <a id="l67"></a>Cyrus Ieshua &amp; Bani or Binnui were chief fathers of the Levites (Nehem <a id="l68"></a>8.10 &amp; Ezra 2.4 &amp; 3.9) &amp; that Iozabad the son of Ieshua &amp; Noadiah the <a id="l69"></a>son of Binnui were chief Levites in the seventh year of Artaxerxes when <a id="l70"></a>Ezra came to Ierusalem (Ezra 8.33) so that this Artaxerxes began his <a id="l71"></a>reign before the end of the second generation. And that he reigned in the <a id="l72"></a>time of the third generation is confirmed by two instances more. For <a id="l73"></a>Meshullam the son of Berechiah the son of Meshezabeel &amp; Azariah <a id="l74"></a>the son of Maasejah the son of Anamiah were fathers of their <a id="l75"></a>houses at the repairing of the wall (Nehem 3.4, 23) &amp; their Grand<a id="l76"></a>fathers Meshezabeel &amp; Hananiah subscribed the covenant in the <a id="l77"></a>reign of Cyrus Nehem 10.21, 23. Yea Nehemiah himself this same <a id="l78"></a>Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah was then Tirshatha &amp; subscribed it <a id="l79"></a>(Nehem. 10.1 &amp; 8.9 &amp; Ezra 2.2, 63) &amp; therefore in the 32<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l80"></a>Artaxerxes Longimanus was above 120 years old &amp; if you produce <a id="l81"></a>his age to the 32<sup>th</sup> of Artaxerxes Mnemon he will be above 180 years <a id="l82"></a>old, an age surely too great. The same may be said of Ezra if he <a id="l83"></a>was that Priest &amp; Scribe who read the Law Nehem 8. For he is <a id="l84"></a>the son of Serajah the son of Azariah the son of Hilkiah the son of Shallum &amp;c (Ezra 7.1) <a id="l85"></a>&amp; this Serajah went into captivity at the burning of the Temple &amp; <a id="l86"></a>was there slain (1 Chron. 6.14 &amp; 2 King. 25.18) &amp; from his death to the <a id="l87"></a>20<sup>th</sup> year of Artaxerxes Mnemon is above 200 years, an age too <a id="l88"></a>great.</p>
<p id="par7">I consider further that Ezra (chap. 4) names Cyrus,  *, Darius,  <a id="l89"></a>Achswerus  &amp; Artaxerxes in continual order as successors to one another <a id="l90"></a>&amp; these names agree to Cyrus,  *, Darius Hystaspis, Xerxes &amp; Artaxerxes <a id="l91"></a>Longimanus &amp; to no other Persian Kings.  Some here  take this Artaxerxes to <a id="l99"></a>be  not the successor but the predecessor of Darius Hystaspis,  not <a id="l100"></a>considering that in his reign  the Iews were busy in building the City &amp; the <a id="l101"></a>wall (Ezra 4.12) &amp; by consequence had finished the Temple before. Ezra describes <a id="l102"></a>first how the people of the land hindred  the building of the <a id="l103"></a>Temple all the days of Cyrus &amp; further till the reign of Darius &amp; after the Temple was <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002v"> &lt;2v&gt; </span>
built how they hindred the building of the city in the reign of Achswerus <a id="l104"></a>&amp; Artaxerxes &amp; then returns back to the story of the Temple in the reign <a id="l105"></a>of Cyrus &amp; Darius. And this  is confirmed by  comparing the book of Ezra <a id="l106"></a>which the first book of Esdras. For if in the book of Ezra you omit the story of <a id="l107"></a>Achswerus &amp; Artaxerxes &amp; in that of Esdras you omit the same story of Artax<a id="l108"></a>erxes &amp; that of the three wise men the two Books will agree so that the book <a id="l109"></a>of Esdras  (if you except the story of the three wise men) was originally copied <a id="l110"></a>from  writings of good authority.  Now the story of Artaxerxes which (which that of Ahaswerus) in the book of Ezra interrupts <a id="l112"></a>the story of Darius, does not interrupt  it in the book of Ezdras but is there inserted into the story of Cyrus <a id="l113"></a>between the first &amp; second chapter of Ezra &amp; all the rest of the story of Cyrus <a id="l114"></a>&amp; that of Darius is told in the book of Esdras in continual order whichout any interruption. <a id="l115"></a>So that the Darius the in the book of Ezra precedes Achswerus &amp; Artaxerxes &amp; the Darius <a id="l116"></a>which in the same book follows them is by the book of Esdras one &amp; the same Darius, &amp; I take <a id="l117"></a>the book of Esdras to be the best interpreter of the book of Ezra. So then <a id="l118"></a>the Darius mentioned  between Cyrus &amp; Achsuerus is Darius Hystaspis &amp;  there<a id="l119"></a>fore Achswerus &amp; Artaxerxes who succeed him are Xerxes &amp; Artaxerxes <a id="l120"></a>Longimanus &amp;  the Iews who came up from Artaxerxes to Ierusalem <a id="l121"></a>&amp; began to build the city &amp; the wall Ezra 4.13 are Ezra which his companions. Which <a id="l122"></a>being understood the history of the Iews in the reign of those Kings will  be <a id="l123"></a>as follows.</p>
<p id="par8"> After the Temple was built &amp;  Darius was dead the enemies of the <a id="l124"></a>Iews in the beginning of the reign of his successor Achswerus or Xerxes wrote unto him an accusation <a id="l125"></a>against them   (Ezra 4.6) but in the seventh year of his successor Artaxerxes <a id="l126"></a>Ezra &amp; his companions went up from Babylon   which offerings &amp; Vessels for the Tem<a id="l127"></a>ple &amp; power to bestow on it out of the Kings Treasure  what <a id="l128"></a>should be requisite (Ezra 7.) Whence the Temple is said to be finished according <a id="l129"></a>to the commandment of Cyrus &amp; Darius &amp; Artaxerxes  King of Persia (Ezra 6.<a id="l130"></a>14) Their commission was also to set Magistrates &amp; Iudges over the land  &amp; thereby be<a id="l131"></a>coming a new Body Politick they were encouraged to attempt the rebuilding of  <a id="l132"></a> Ierusalem &amp; its wall. And thence Ezra saith in his prayer that God had <em class="underline">extended mercy to them in the sight of the Kings of Persia &amp; given them a  reviving to set up the house of their God, &amp; to repair the desolation thereof &amp; to give them a <span class="large">wall</span> in Iudah &amp; in Ierusalem</em>. (Ezra 9.9.) But when  they had begun to repair the wall their enemies wrote &amp;c  But the enemies  wrote against them to  Artaxerxes <a id="l133"></a> <em class="underline">Be it known</em>, say they, <em class="underline">unto the King <a id="l134"></a>that  the Iews the came up from thee to us are come into Ierusalem <a id="l135"></a>building the rebellious &amp; the bad City &amp; have set up the walls thereof &amp; joyned <a id="l136"></a>the foundations</em> &amp;c  And the King wrote back that the Iews should cease <a id="l137"></a>&amp; the City not be built untill another commandment should be given from <a id="l138"></a>him, whereupon their enemies went up to Ierusalem &amp; made them cease by force &amp; power (Ezra <a id="l139"></a>4.) But in the 20<sup>th</sup> year of the King  Nehemiah hearing that the Iews were <a id="l140"></a>in great affliction &amp; distress &amp; that the wall of Ierusalem (that wall (which  had been newly repaired)  was broken down &amp; <a id="l141"></a>the gates thereof burnt which fire    he obteined  leave <a id="l142"></a>of the King to go &amp; build the City &amp; the Governours house  (Nehem 1.3 &amp; 2.6, 8, 17) but after he had built <a id="l143"></a>the wall the people in the City were but few &amp; the houses were un<a id="l144"></a>built (Nehem. 7.1, 4) And In this condition he left Ierusalem in the 32<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l145"></a>of the King &amp; after some time returning back reformed such abuses as had <a id="l146"></a>been committed in his absence (Nehem 13.) And here ends the sacred history of the Iews except <a id="l147"></a>that in the original manuscript of the Chronicles the Genealogy of the Priests &amp; <a id="l148"></a>Levites was recorded till about the end of the Persian Monarchy (Nehem 12.22, 23</p>

<h2 id="hd4" class="cent">Chap <a id="l149"></a><br>Of the sacred history of the Persian Empire.</h2>    
<p id="par9"><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> This history is described in the books of Ezra &amp; Ne<a id="l150"></a>hemiah &amp; to adjust it which prophane history has per<a id="l151"></a>plext learned men. I shall not stand to  recite other <a id="l152"></a>men's opinions but propose as shortly as I can what I take to be the truth.</p>
<p id="par10">I observe therefore 1<sup>st</sup> that Ezra &amp; Nehemiah <a id="l153"></a> flourished in the times of one &amp; the same Artaxerxes. For   <a id="l154"></a>this Ezra the scribe was which Nehemiah at the dedication of the wall of <a id="l155"></a>Ierusalem Nehem 12.36.</p>
<p id="par11">2.  That During all the <a id="l156"></a>Persian Monarchy there were six High Priests in a <a id="l157"></a>continual succession of father &amp; Son, namely, Ieshua <a id="l158"></a>Iojakim, Eliashib, Iojada, Ionathan, Iaddua.  That if <a id="l159"></a>by an equal division of the times of their priesthood there be allotted <a id="l160"></a>about 34 years to each, so that all together may take up the whole time of that monarchy which stood 200 years, the high Priesthood of Eliashib <a id="l161"></a>will fall in with  the reign of the first Artaxerxes. <a id="l162"></a> And that Nehemiah flourished in the  <a id="l163"></a>High Priesthood of  Eliashib, Nehem 3.1 &amp; 13.28. But if Eliasib &amp; Nehemiah <a id="l164"></a>be  placed in the reign of the 2<sup>d</sup> Artaxerxes,  <a id="l165"></a>since they lived beyond the 32<sup>th</sup> year of that king Nehem 13.28) there <a id="l166"></a>must be at least 157 years allotted to the three first <a id="l167"></a>High Priests &amp; but 43 to the five last, a division <a id="l168"></a>too unequal.</p>
<p id="par12">3 The   times of the three first of these high Priests fell in <a id="l169"></a>which the ordinary generations of   all the other chief  Priests  mentioned in Nehem. 12. <a id="l170"></a>&amp; so were but of an ordinary length. For in the high-<a id="l171"></a>priesthood of Ieshua the chief Priests were Serajeh, Iere<a id="l172"></a>miah, Ezra, Amariah, Malluc or Melicu, Hattush, Shecha<a id="l173"></a>niah or Shebaniah, Rehum or Harim, Meremoth, Iddo, Gin<a id="l174"></a>netho, Abijah, Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, Shemaiah, &amp;c Nehem. 12.1 <a id="l175"></a> And  in the high-priesthood of his son Iojakim <a id="l176"></a>   the chief Priests were their im<a id="l177"></a>mediate eldest sons, Merajah, Hananiah, Meshullam, Iehohanan, <a id="l178"></a>Ionathan, Ioseph, Adna, Helkai, Zechariah, Meshullam, <a id="l179"></a>Zichri, * Piltai, Shammua, Iehonathan, &amp;c. This Iehonathan or Ionathan was son of Shemaiah above mentioned And in the <a id="l180"></a>high priesthood of Eliashib  at the de<a id="l181"></a>dication of the wall, Zechariah the son of Ionathan  <a id="l182"></a> the son of Shemaiah was one of the Priests Nehem. 12.35. So <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> then these three ages were but ordinary ones &amp; therefore <a id="l183"></a> scarce reach beyond the  reign of the first Artaxerxes.</p>

<p id="par14">4 The reading of the law &amp;  sealing the cove<a id="l187"></a>nant, Nehem. 8, 9, 10, was  in the time of the  priesthood of the first  of these generations. as <a id="l188"></a>you may perceive by comparing the names of the Priests <a id="l189"></a>&amp; Levites who  sealed  it, Nehem. 10, which those <a id="l190"></a>who returned from the Captivity under Cyrus Nehem. 12 <a id="l191"></a> And the  feast of Tabernacles then kept was the <a id="l192"></a>first feast which they kept after that return Nehem. 8.14. <a id="l193"></a>&amp; therefore kept in the first year of the return Ezra <a id="l194"></a>3.4. Now at that time Ieshua &amp; Bani or Binnui were chief fathers of the Levites <a id="l195"></a> Nehem 8 &amp; 10 &amp; Ezra 2.40 &amp; 3.9 &amp;  Iozabad the son <a id="l196"></a>of Ieshua &amp; Noadiah the son of Binnui were chief Levites  <a id="l197"></a>in the seventh year of Artaxerxes when Ezra came to <a id="l198"></a>Ierusalem. Ezra  8.33. This Artaxerxes therefore began his reign <a id="l199"></a> <a id="l203"></a>before the end of the priesthood of the second generation.  And <a id="l204"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> that he reigned in <a id="l205"></a>the time of the third generation is yet confirmed by two instances more. For <a id="l206"></a>Meshullam the son of Berechiah the son of Mesheza<a id="l207"></a>beel, &amp; Azariah the son of Maasejah the son of Ana<a id="l208"></a>niah were fathers of their houses at the repairing of <a id="l209"></a>the wall Nehem. 3.4, 23, &amp; their grandfathers Meshezabeel &amp;  <a id="l210"></a> Hananiah subscribed the Covenant in the reign of <a id="l211"></a>Cyrus Nehem 10.21, 23. Yea Nehemiah himself, this <a id="l212"></a>same Nehemiah the Son of Hachaliah, was then Tirshatha <a id="l213"></a>&amp; subscribed it Nehem 10.1. &amp; 8.9. &amp; Ezra 2.2, 63, &amp; therefore <a id="l214"></a> in the 32<sup>th</sup> year of Artaxerxes was above 120 years old &amp; if you produce his <a id="l215"></a>age to the  32<sup>th</sup> year of the 2<sup>d</sup> Artaxerxes he will <a id="l216"></a>be above 180 years old, an age surely too great. The <a id="l217"></a>same may be said of Ezra if he was that Priest &amp; <a id="l218"></a>scribe who read the law Nehem 8. For he is the Son of <a id="l219"></a>Serajah the son of Azariah the son of Hilkiah the son of <a id="l220"></a>Shallum &amp;c Ezra 7.11  &amp; this Saraiah  <a id="l221"></a>went into captivity at the burning of the Temple &amp; was there slain 1 Chron 6.14 <a id="l222"></a>2 Kings. 25. 18. And from his death to the 20<sup>th</sup> year of the 2<sup>d</sup> Artax<a id="l223"></a>erxes is above 200 years.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span>  
<p id="par15">5.  So then it was in the reign of the first <a id="l224"></a>Artaxerxes that Ezra &amp; Nehemiah came to Ierusalem <a id="l225"></a>&amp; therefore since the second Darius reigned after this Artax<a id="l226"></a>erxes it must be in the reign of the first Darius that <a id="l227"></a>the Temple was  built. For  the second year <a id="l228"></a>of  Darius  in which the foundation was laid, was the  <a id="l229"></a>seventieth of the captivity (Zech. 1.12 &amp; 7.5) &amp; at that time <a id="l230"></a>there were  men living who had seen the first <a id="l231"></a>Temple  (Haggai 2.3) &amp; if the finishing of the Temple <a id="l232"></a>be deferred to the 6<sup>t</sup> year of the second Darius, Ieshua <a id="l233"></a>&amp; Zerubbabel must  have been the one <a id="l234"></a> High Priest the other  Capitain of the people <a id="l235"></a>for 112 years together besides their ages before: which <a id="l236"></a>surely is too long a time.</p>
<p id="par16">6. They that refer these things to the second <a id="l237"></a>Darius &amp; second Artaxerxes ground their opinion <a id="l238"></a>on the  Temples being built in the reigne of the last of the five Persian Kings <a id="l239"></a> Cyrus, Darius, Ahasuerus or Xerxes, Artaxerxes, &amp; Da<a id="l240"></a>rius  named <a id="l241"></a>in order Ezra 4.  And in this I agree which them <a id="l242"></a>that Ahasuerus Achswerus or Axerxes is Xerxes <a id="l243"></a>but I say that the last Darius is the same which the <a id="l244"></a>first. For the letters to Ahasuerus &amp; Artaxerxes <a id="l245"></a>there mentioned concern not the building of the Temple but the <a id="l246"></a>building of the City after the Temple was finished <a id="l247"></a>And Ezra when he had related these letters about the City returns <a id="l248"></a>back to  the building of the Temple in the <a id="l249"></a>reign of the first Darius.</p>
<p id="par17">7. Or, to speak what I more suspect, the <a id="l250"></a> order of the  leaves of the books of <a id="l251"></a>Ezra &amp; Nehemiah has been changed since the first <a id="l252"></a>writing &amp; these two letters inserted in a wrong place. <a id="l253"></a>For these books &amp; the first book of Esdras consist <a id="l254"></a>of the same  parts of history set together in different orders <a id="l255"></a>&amp; the story of the Temple is there continued <a id="l256"></a>without the interposition of these letters. I suspect <a id="l257"></a>therefore that  when Antiochus Epiphanes had burnt <a id="l258"></a>the sacred writings &amp; made it death for any man <a id="l259"></a>to conceale them &amp; Iudas Maccabeus  recollected <a id="l260"></a>what he  could afterwards find: some of the sacred <a id="l261"></a>writings (as the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel) <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>were<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> lost &amp; others found only in scattered leaves &amp; put <a id="l262"></a>together sometimes in a wrong order. For tis agreed that  a <a id="l263"></a> part of the prophesy of Isaiah <a id="l265"></a>is now added to the book of Zacchary. And some suspect <a id="l266"></a>that by the like accident   some leaves of the book of Iob  have been <a id="l267"></a>set together in wrong order &amp; that in the book of Samuel <a id="l268"></a>the story of Davids playing before Saul to drive away his <a id="l269"></a>evil spirit &amp; becoming his Armor bearer &amp; Saul's loving <a id="l270"></a>him greatly has been set before the story of Davids <a id="l271"></a>killing Goliath when Saul knew him not but asked again <a id="l272"></a>&amp; again whose son he was. Certainly the 1<sup>st</sup> book of <a id="l273"></a>Esdras  is made up of the same  pieces of history which that of <a id="l274"></a>Ezra &amp; Nehemiah but  in another order: &amp; no man <a id="l275"></a>would have joyned them in a wrong order had the right <a id="l276"></a>order been then known. I will not undertake to rec<a id="l277"></a>tify the sacred books but out of them &amp; the 1<sup>st</sup> book <a id="l278"></a>of Esdras I will  only say  how the   history of the <a id="l279"></a>Persian Empire may be read in  continuall order of time.</p>
<p id="par18">In order to this</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; insertion from f 5v &gt; </span>
<p id="par19">In order to this I would distinguish the books of Ezra into <a id="l280"></a> severall joynts or parts &amp; then consider how they <a id="l281"></a>are to be set together. The first joynt I reccon the first chap<a id="l282"></a>ter of Ezra, the second the second chapter to the end of the last vers but <a id="l283"></a>one, the third  to reach thence  to the end of the 7<sup>th</sup> <a id="l284"></a>vers of the third chapter, the fourth thence to the end of the <a id="l285"></a>5<sup>t</sup> vers of the 4<sup>th</sup> chapter, the fift thence to the end of the 23<sup>d</sup> <a id="l286"></a>vers of the same chapter the sixt thence to the end of the <a id="l287"></a>book, the seventh thence to the last vers but one of the seventh <a id="l288"></a>chapter of Nehemiah, the eighth thence to the end of the <a id="l289"></a>three next chapters, the ninth thence to the  end of the next <a id="l290"></a>chapter the 10<sup>th</sup> thence to the end of the 12<sup>th</sup> chapter &amp; the 11<sup>th</sup> <a id="l291"></a>thence to the end of the book. For the first &amp; second joynts <a id="l292"></a>are found divided from another in  Esdras: the second is <a id="l293"></a>followed by the 8<sup>th</sup> in  Nehemiah, but ought to be followed <a id="l294"></a>by the ninth: The eighth ought to come in between the third <a id="l295"></a>&amp; 4<sup>th</sup>,  the fift is wanting in Esdras between the 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; sixt <a id="l296"></a>&amp; between the 10<sup>th</sup> &amp; 11<sup>th</sup> some  leaves seem to have <a id="l297"></a>been lost.</p>
<p id="par20">Now the history will become continued &amp; clear &amp; consonant <a id="l298"></a>to prophane history if the joynts be read in this order, the <a id="l299"></a>first, the second, the ninth, the third, the eighth, the fourth, <a id="l300"></a>the sixt, the fift, the seventh, the ninth, the eighth the 10<sup>th</sup> <a id="l301"></a>&amp; 11<sup>th</sup>. And this will appear by these three  alterations.</p>
    <p id="par21">First that the  ninth joynt ought in <a id="l302"></a>point of time to be inserted between the  <a id="l304"></a> second &amp; third joynts.  For-</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 6r resumes &gt; </span>
    


<p id="par24">First then I would insert the 11<sup>th</sup> chapter of <a id="l315"></a>Nehemiah between the two last verses of the second <a id="l316"></a>chapter of Ezra. For it conteins a relation how all <a id="l317"></a>the people upon their  first return from captivity  <a id="l318"></a>under Cyrus distributed themselves by lot  at Ierusalem <a id="l319"></a>to go thence into their several cities where they were found in the  beginning of the next article. This I gather partly <a id="l320"></a> out of 1 Chron. 9 where  this 11<sup>th</sup> chapter of Ne<a id="l321"></a>hemiah is in part repeated &amp; the people at this distri<a id="l322"></a>bution are said to be the first inhabitants that dwelt in <a id="l323"></a>their possessions in their cities 1 Chron 9.2: &amp; partly <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006v"> &lt;6v&gt; </span> by the names of those  <a id="l324"></a>who were concerned in this distribution. For  Akkub &amp; Talmon the chief <a id="l325"></a>of the Porters  were there &amp; so was  <a id="l326"></a>Mattaniah the son of Mica the son of Asaph who was over the thanksgiving  Nehem 11.17, 19 <a id="l327"></a>&amp; these returned from the captivity which Zerubbabel. Ezra <a id="l328"></a>2.42 Nehem. 12.8.</p>
<p id="par25">Secondly that the  8<sup>th</sup> joynt  ought in point of time to be inserted between the   3<sup>d</sup> &amp; 4<sup>th</sup> joynts. For the reading of the law <a id="l332"></a>began the same day  which the sacrifices at the first return, as I shewed above <a id="l333"></a> For Ezra read the law in the seventh month next after Zerubbabels return Nehem 7.73 &amp; 8.1, 2.</p>
<p id="par26">  The chief fathers of the Levites who returned <a id="l338"></a>which Zerubbabel &amp; stood up to lay the foundations of the Tem<a id="l339"></a>ple were Ieshua Kadmiel &amp; Hodaviah, Hodajah of Iudah Ezra 2.40. <a id="l340"></a>&amp; these were chief in explaining the law to the people <a id="l341"></a>when Ezra  read it  &amp; in making the covenant <a id="l342"></a>Nehem. 3 &amp; 4. And  the Priests &amp; <a id="l343"></a>Levites who returned which Zerubbabel  sealed it as you <a id="l344"></a>may see by the following comparison of their names</p>

<p id="par27" class="i0">Thus you see all the chief Priests &amp; Levites who returned which <a id="l345"></a>Zerubbabel ( &amp; some others besides)  sealed the covenant <a id="l346"></a>&amp; therefore it was made soon after the return,  <a id="l347"></a>&amp;  by consequence the first year  because at the revival of the <a id="l348"></a>feast of Tabernacles as was shewed above. Nehem 8.14. Ezr. 3.4</p>
<p id="par28">The third alteration is  to place the fift joynt  next after the sixt that is the Letters to Ahashuerus &amp; Artaxerxes at the end of the <a id="l350"></a>book of Ezra. For the fourth &amp; sixt joynts are con<a id="l351"></a>tinued in the book of Esdras.  <a id="l352"></a> &amp; the sixt set  before the 4<sup>th</sup>, so that it was a fragment which the Collector knew not how to place. By placing  it between the 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; 6<sup>t</sup> the story of building the temple <a id="l353"></a>is interrupted by the story of building the city.  This <a id="l354"></a>was of a later date &amp; therefore is misplaced &amp; ought to come after<a id="l355"></a>wards. In the letter to Artaxerxes there is no mention <a id="l356"></a>of building the Temple as there would have been <a id="l357"></a>surely, had the Iews been then about that &amp; therefore tis of a later date. The letter <a id="l358"></a>represents that the Iews which came up from Artax<a id="l359"></a>erxes  were then come to Ierusalem building the rebelli<a id="l360"></a>ous &amp; bad city &amp; had set up the walls thereof &amp; joyned <a id="l361"></a>the foundations: &amp; therefore it was writ against Ezra <a id="l362"></a>&amp; his companions  some time after their coming from the <a id="l363"></a>King to Ierusalem upon occasion of their attempting to <a id="l364"></a> repaire the City.  For these were the only men who came up from this King to do these things.  And hence when the <a id="l365"></a>enemies of the Iews had by this letter procured the Kings <a id="l366"></a>order that the city should not be built till he gave <a id="l367"></a>a new commandment &amp; made them cease by force &amp; power, Nehemiah soon after enquiring <a id="l368"></a>of the state of the Iews at Ierusalem hears that they  were in <a id="l369"></a> great  affliction &amp; reproach &amp; that the wall <a id="l370"></a>of Ierusalem was broken down &amp; the gates burnt which fire <a id="l371"></a>This was news to him in the 20<sup>th</sup> year of the King <a id="l372"></a>&amp; therefore done not  many months before by the enemies of  Ezra,  as above. For these reasons therefore I  subjoyn <a id="l375"></a>these letters to the story of  Ezra as an introduction <a id="l376"></a>to the story of Nehemiah.</p>
 
<p id="par30">If you now read over the sacred History according <a id="l377"></a>to the order presented by these three alterations,  you will <a id="l378"></a>find it  more eaven &amp; intelligible &amp; agreable to prophane history then <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> before &amp; to amount only to this, That in the reign of  <a id="l379"></a>Cyrus when Zerubbabel came which the people to Ierusalem they <a id="l380"></a>went thence by lot into their cities till the seventh &amp; then <a id="l381"></a>began to sacrifice to heare the law  &amp; to keep the feast of <a id="l382"></a>Tabernacles. The next year they laid the foundation of the <a id="l383"></a>Temple but were hindred from  building all the reign of <a id="l384"></a>Cyrus &amp; Cambyses till the 2<sup>d</sup> year of Darius Hystaspis. Then they finished <a id="l385"></a>it in four years. But so soon as their friend Darius was dead <a id="l386"></a>their enemies  in the beginning of the reign of his son <a id="l387"></a>Ahashuerus or Xerxes wrote an accusation against them to the King. So the <a id="l388"></a>Iews continued in  distress till the seventh year of his son <a id="l389"></a>Artaxerxes Longimanus when Ezra  by a new degree carryed a  <a id="l390"></a>new body of Iews from captivity to Ierusalem, adorned the <a id="l391"></a>Temple  revived the  worship, &amp;  restored the polity of <a id="l392"></a>the nation, but when they had made good progress in building <a id="l393"></a>the City &amp; the walls &amp; the work went on fast, their enemies by a new accusa<a id="l394"></a>tion procured the Kings order that the City should not <a id="l395"></a>be built till he gave a new commandment, &amp; there<a id="l396"></a>upon they made them cease by armed force &amp;  brake down <a id="l397"></a>the wall &amp; burnt the gates. But so soon as this came <a id="l398"></a>to the ears of Nehemiah, he procured the Kings order <a id="l399"></a>for building the City &amp; between the 20<sup>th</sup> &amp; 32<sup>th</sup> years <a id="l400"></a>of that King repaired the walls &amp; took a register of all <a id="l401"></a>the people. Afterwards he returned to the king &amp; <a id="l402"></a>the people in his absence began to corrupt themselves <a id="l403"></a>but before the King's death he came again to Ieru<a id="l404"></a>salem &amp; reformed them. And here ends the Iewish history <a id="l405"></a>excepting that the  genealogy of the Priests &amp; Levites was written in the <a id="l406"></a>Register till the end of the Persian Monarchy. But these <a id="l407"></a>genealogies being lost &amp; the Iews having no history of the <a id="l408"></a>later Kings of Persia, they have made the duration of <a id="l409"></a>this Monarchy much shorter then it was.</p>
<p id="par31">The history being cleared let us now see how it <a id="l410"></a>agrees which the Prophesy of Daniel's weeks.</p>
<p id="par32"><em class="underline">Seventy weeks are  cut out upon thy people &amp; upon <a id="l411"></a>thy holy city to finish transgression &amp; to seal up sins &amp; to expiate <a id="l412"></a>iniquity &amp; bring in everlasting righteousnes &amp; to seale the vision <a id="l413"></a>&amp; the prophesy &amp; to annoint the most  Holy</em>. There <a id="l414"></a>were two returns from captivity, the first under Zerubbabel the second under Ezra &amp; at the second  <a id="l415"></a>Ezra by  the addition of  people he brought which him <a id="l416"></a> by  reviving  the worship at Ierusalem, &amp; by ordaining <a id="l417"></a>Magistrates in all the land  to judge &amp; govern them according 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008v"> &lt;8v&gt; </span> 
to the laws of Moses &amp; the King, they became a people <a id="l418"></a>or body politick &amp; a holy City. For till they had a polity <a id="l419"></a>&amp; government of their own they were neither a people nor <a id="l420"></a>a City in the sense of Daniel. And by the death &amp; re<a id="l421"></a>surrection of Christ was transgression finished &amp; sins sealed <a id="l422"></a>up or absolved &amp; iniquity expiated &amp; everlasting righteousness brought in &amp; this prophesy ended <a id="l423"></a>&amp; the most Holy annoynted. And from the first period to <a id="l424"></a>the last that is from the year of the Iulian period 4257 to <a id="l425"></a>the year 4747 are just 490 years, that is seventy weeks. <a id="l426"></a>For Xerxis was slain an 4 Olymp 78 (Sulpitius) <a id="l427"></a>Then Artabanus reigned 7 months &amp; Artaxerxes  Longimanus began <a id="l428"></a>his reign an 1 Olymp 79 (Diodor. l 11. Euseb. Chron.) &amp; his 20<sup>th</sup> <a id="l429"></a>year fell in which an 4 Olymp 83 (Africanus apud Euseb.) Whence <a id="l430"></a>his reign began about the end of Summer or in autumn, An. Per. Iul. 4250 <sup>✝</sup> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the left margin of f 8v &gt; </span>✝ For his 20<sup>th</sup> year extended from the ninth month to the <a id="l431"></a>first month Nehem 1.1 &amp; 2.1 &amp; from the first to the <a id="l432"></a>fift Ezr. 7.7, 8, 9 &amp; therefore his years began in the <a id="l433"></a>autumnal half year<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 8v resumes &gt; </span> <a id="l434"></a>&amp; Ezra's journey in his seventh year being in spring was <a id="l435"></a>An. Per. Iul. 4257. The death of Christ is usually referred <a id="l436"></a>to the of Christ 33 but I had rather refer it to the year <a id="l437"></a>following An. Per. Iul. 4747, this being both the sabbatical year &amp; as Euse<a id="l438"></a>bius notes, the year of Iubile.   For this affords us a reason why the <a id="l439"></a> first Christians had all things common, Act. 2.44, 45.And  it was to the  manumission of servants &amp; the drawing of water out of the river Siloam in the end of the feast <a id="l443"></a>of Tabernacles in the beginning of this sabattical year that Christ <a id="l444"></a>alluded to at this  Feast when he spake of making servants free &amp; drinking water of life &amp; rivers of this water flowing out of his belly Iohn 7 &amp; 8 when he said:  Iohn 7 &amp; 8.</p>
<p id="par33"><em class="underline">Know also &amp; understand that from the going forth of <a id="l450"></a>the commandment to  cause to return &amp; to build Ierusa<a id="l451"></a>lem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks</em> <a id="l452"></a>The former part of the Prophesy related to the  first coming of <a id="l453"></a>Christ, this being dated to the coming of the Messiah to be <em class="underline">Prince</em>. seems to relate to the  second. For all Daniel's <a id="l454"></a>Prophesies reach to the end of the world &amp; there is scarce a <a id="l455"></a>prophesy in the old Testament  concerning Christ the does <a id="l456"></a>not in something or other relate to his second coming. Nor is <a id="l457"></a>it  a new opinion to apply some part of this prophesy  to that  coming. For so did  Irenæus l. 5. c. 25. æ also Iulius Africa<a id="l458"></a>nus the Chronologer, Hippolytus an Arabian Bishop &amp; Apollinaris Bishop <a id="l459"></a>of Laodicea as Ierom in his commentary on this place mentions <a id="l460"></a>This clause therefore  I had rather leave to  <a id="l461"></a>be explained by time then venture upon a rash interpretation <a id="l462"></a> of what I do not yet understand.</p>
