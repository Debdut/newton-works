<p id="par1">Now the  rise of the Apostasy in point of religion was on this <a id="l1"></a>manner. When the  Sun Moon &amp; Stars of the Heathen Roman empire were <a id="l2"></a>smitten  &amp; the great red Dragon that old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan who deceived <a id="l3"></a>the whole world was  by Michael &amp; his Angels (in the wars between <a id="l4"></a>Constantine the great &amp; Licinius)  overcom &amp; cast out of the heaven of the Roman <a id="l5"></a>throne  &amp; in its room the Christian religion  was  exalted to that throne: then did the honour,  riches, power &amp;  temporal advantages  of this religion begin to tempt the heathens   dayly to <a id="l8"></a>turn Christians; &amp; in such converts   who for temporall interest thus flowed into the Church  the Devil   now came down amongst the   Christian people of the Eastern &amp; Western <a id="l13"></a>Empires called the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea.

<p id="par4" class="i0">– While the Empire continued heathen  the small encouragements for <a id="l49"></a>hypocrites to turn christians  was a guard upon <a id="l50"></a>the Christian religion to keep it from growing corrupt. For the mystery of <a id="l51"></a>iniquity which then worked could not grow to any maturity for want of <a id="l52"></a>hypocrites to work upon:  but after the  heathen religion which thus <a id="l53"></a>withheld the revelation of this mystery, was taken out of the way that mys<a id="l54"></a>tery no longer wanting a fit people to work upon must begin to grow <a id="l55"></a>proportionally to the increase of hypocrites &amp; so as in a short time by <a id="l56"></a>the prevailing of  such fals christians to be revealed. For in a dayly <a id="l57"></a>flow of such converts into the Churches it could not be but that in a <a id="l58"></a>few years the hypocrites would be more then double or triple to the sincere not <a id="l59"></a>to say more then ten or twenty times their number. Now by this influx <a id="l60"></a>of fals converts the mystery of iniquity grew in these respects.</p>
<p id="par5">First the Churches by the mixture &amp; allay of such converts soon be<a id="l61"></a>came very corrupt in manners. They that please to read the Book of Salvian <a id="l62"></a>De Providentia Dei an author very sober, cordate &amp; pious will find that <a id="l63"></a>within less then an hundred years after  Constantines victory the Christians all over the Empire so far as his information reacht were grown as much or more debaucht <a id="l64"></a>in manners (whoring, drinking,  swearing, lying, gaming, cheating,  injustice oppression) then even the <a id="l65"></a> barbarous nations &amp; old heathens &amp;  the various sorts of heretical christians. <a id="l66"></a> This Salvian shews to satisfy his readers that God was just in subjecting <a id="l67"></a>the Romans to the violence &amp; dominion of the less wicked Barbarous nations who in the <a id="l68"></a>yeare 407  invaded the western empire. And if you will be at the pains <a id="l69"></a>to compare him with what you may find to the same purpose scatered up &amp; down in the <a id="l70"></a>Ecclesiastical historians,  Gregory Nazianzen,  Faustinus  his Libellus precum, Ierom, Austin Guildas &amp; other <a id="l71"></a>authors of those times, as well concerning the  pride ambition, contentiousness &amp; other ill <a id="l72"></a>manners of the Clergy &amp; Monks, as those of the rest of the people; you will find <a id="l73"></a>sufficient reason to beleive that  Salvian wrote the truth  impartially.  <a id="l74"></a>He wrote not in a peevish way to accuse his age but in a  sober <a id="l75"></a>way to answer an objection made by many of his own age about the justice <a id="l76"></a>of God &amp; to satisfy them by relating the matters of fact which they to whom <a id="l77"></a>he wrote were judges of as well as he. Nor is't a wonder that Christians <a id="l78"></a>should become so vitious in so short a time seing the most immoral of the <a id="l79"></a>heathens would be most apt to turn Christians for interest &amp; the most <a id="l80"></a>ambitious Christians would seek most for preferment in the Churches. Euse<a id="l81"></a>bius in his Ecclesiastical history tells us that Christians betwen the perse<a id="l82"></a>cutions of Decius &amp; Dioclesian through a respite of 30 or 40 years <a id="l83"></a>from persecution began to grow  very corrupt in manners.  <a id="l84"></a>&amp; much more would they grow corrupt  in a more lasting peace when <a id="l85"></a>they were not only freed from persecution but  flourished <a id="l86"></a>in  rices &amp; honours &amp; dominion over the world &amp; were daily allayed &amp; corrupted by the <a id="l87"></a>influx of the most hypocritical &amp; consequently the worst of heathens. It may be said indeed that the manners <a id="l88"></a>of Christians were corrected by the persecutions they suffered under Constan<a id="l89"></a>tius Iulian &amp; Valens: but  those  sufferings were  not much in the west &amp; <a id="l90"></a>but for a time &amp; not directly for religion but upon accusations for various <a id="l91"></a>crimes, as Basil tells us of the sufferings under Valens &amp; Athanasius &amp; Hilary <a id="l92"></a>of those under Constantius. And the same method was used by the King of the Vandals <a id="l93"></a>against the Africans.  For when  he would persecute them he caused their sacred virgins  to be searched by midwives  &amp; those <a id="l94"></a>who were found vitiated,  to be forced by tortures to confess  who  had  layn with <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>them<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> saying Dicite quomodo sacerdotes vestri concumbunt vobiscum &amp; then upon their con<a id="l95"></a>fession about four thousand  of their Bishops &amp; Priests were banished <a id="l96"></a>together as Victor  de Persecutione Vandalica relates. This I mention in <a id="l97"></a>confirmation of what Salvian affirms of the Africans. For he describes them <a id="l98"></a>the unchastest of all the Romans &amp; that God's  judgment was conspicuous in subjecting them to <a id="l99"></a>the Vandals who were the chastest of all the Barbarians &amp; by their laws had <a id="l100"></a>almost made the Africans themselves chast.  And the cruelty <a id="l101"></a>of Valens the Emperor  &amp; those about him in causing 80 Presbyters <a id="l102"></a>to be burnt together in a ship would afford us another notable instance  were it not that I find in Gregory Nazianzen  (who lived in the time  when the thing was done &amp; neare the place <a id="l105"></a>where twas done)  that the first report was  but of one Presbyter  senten<a id="l106"></a>ced to be burnt with a ship  at Sea &amp; of many people standing upon the <a id="l107"></a>shore to see the execution done.  [But an earlier instance we have in the  contentions about <a id="l109"></a>Athanasius &amp; some others . For whilst Athanasius was <a id="l110"></a>accused of killing Arsenius &amp;c  &amp; contended that Arsenius was alive &amp; <a id="l111"></a>the Eusebians in the Councel of Tyre  in confutation thereof produced <a id="l112"></a>(not the hand of Arsenius in a bag as the vulgar story is but)  a corps <a id="l113"></a> for them <a id="l114"></a>to view who pretended to know Arsenius,  as Athana<a id="l115"></a>sius &amp; three hundred Bishops of Egypt &amp; the West in the letter of the Council of Sardica <a id="l116"></a>to the <span class="hspac-n" title="20 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> affirm: the  heats in managing <a id="l117"></a>these &amp; such like disputes &amp; at length the  consent of all the world  against <a id="l118"></a>Athanasius (even those few who were banished for him off] </p>
<p id="par6"> In the next place the Churches began in this age to incline to superstition <a id="l129"></a> in forbidding to marry &amp; commanding  <a id="l130"></a>immoderate abstinence from meats. For such was the discipline of the <a id="l131"></a>Monks &amp; in some measure of the clergy.

The first instituti<a id="l134"></a>on is still by many applauded  but I find it faulty in these things. <a id="l135"></a>Moderate fasting of  private men in  secret or of the whole church  <a id="l136"></a>openly  upon set occasions is commendable: but for  any private man or sect <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>of<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l137"></a>men to make a publick profession of fasting &amp; devotion not common to the whole church <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>is<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l138"></a>that singularity  reprehended by Christ in  hypocrites who <a id="l139"></a>loved to pray standing in the synagogues &amp; in the corners of the streets &amp; disfigured their faces that by their sad countenances  they might appear unto men <a id="l141"></a>to fast, &amp; therefore had their reward in  this world in the applause of men. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002v"> &lt;2v&gt; </span> And Secondly  by perusing the histories of  the first Monks <a id="l142"></a>(written by <span class="hspac-n" title="Space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <a id="l143"></a> I find  it was a general complaint among them that  upon their <a id="l144"></a>entring into the profession of  a Monastick life they found themselves <a id="l145"></a>more tempted in the flesh then before &amp; those who became strickter professors <a id="l146"></a>thereof &amp; on that account  went by degrees further into  the wil<a id="l147"></a>dernesses then others did, complained most of all of temptations. The reason <a id="l148"></a>they gave of it was that the devil tempted them most who  were most <a id="l149"></a>his enemies &amp; fought most against him: but the  true reason was partly <a id="l150"></a>that  the desire was inflamed by  prohibition of lawfull marriage, &amp; partly that <a id="l151"></a>the profession of chastity &amp;  daily fasting on that account put them perpetually <a id="l152"></a>in mind of what they strove against, &amp;  their idle lives gave liberty <a id="l153"></a>to their thoughts to follow their inclinations.  The way to chastity is <a id="l154"></a>not to struggle directly with incontinent thoughts but to avert the  thoughts by  some im<a id="l155"></a>ployment,  or by reading, or meditating on other things, or by convers. <a id="l156"></a> By immoderate fasting the body  is also put out of its due temper <a id="l157"></a>&amp; for want of  sleep the fansy  is  invigorated about what<a id="l158"></a>ever it sets it self upon &amp; by degrees inclines  towards a delirium  in so much that those Monks  who fasted most  arrived to <a id="l160"></a>a state of  seing apparitions of weomen &amp;  their shapes &amp; of hearing their voices in <a id="l161"></a>such a lively manner as made them often  think  the visions true apparitions of the Devil <a id="l162"></a>tempting them to lust. Thus while we pray that God would not lead us into tentation, these men ran themselves headlong into it.   And as I have  not met with more  unclean<a id="l163"></a>ness superstition ignorance &amp;  folly in any sort of men then in the lives <a id="l164"></a>of these first Monks written by their admirers Palladius, <span class="hspac-n" title="6 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Theodoret <span class="hspac-n" title="10 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <a id="l165"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="15 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; others, so it may suffice that their profession of forbidding <a id="l166"></a>to marry &amp; teaching to abstein from meats  is by the <a id="l167"></a>Apostle condemned &amp; made the character of such as in the last times should <a id="l168"></a>depart from the faith.</p>
<p id="par7">In the third place it is observable that  in this age the <a id="l169"></a>heathen doctrine of dæmons was brought into the Churches by  <a id="l170"></a> lying signes &amp; wonders. For after that the miracles of the Apostolick age were <a id="l171"></a>ceased  &amp; for 200 years were scarce heard of in the chur<a id="l172"></a>ches, there began  in the latter end of Constantius's reign a  new fame of strange miracles of a different kind done in Egypt &amp; Syria at the tombs of the martyrs; where<a id="l174"></a>upon the  miracle working reliques of the Egyptian martyrs were <a id="l175"></a>about the beginning of the reign of Valentinian  &amp; Valens sent from thence into <a id="l176"></a>all the world &amp; new martyrs dayly found out in  all places the wandring Monks carrying their reliques up &amp; <a id="l178"></a>down.  And with the noise of these miracles came into the Churches the beleife of the Ghosts <a id="l180"></a>of saints being about their tombs &amp; reliques &amp; of their being able to heare &amp; help <a id="l181"></a>those that invoked them.  And to these superstitions,  the  heathen converts being  through education &amp; custome  <a id="l183"></a>very propense, they grew so fast in the Churches that it may be safely said <a id="l184"></a>that before the final division of the empire the invocation of saints was <a id="l185"></a>grown customary. At the same time came in also the   superstition of  working miracles by the signe of the cros,   &amp; the humour of <a id="l187"></a>writing legendary stories,  that age receiving such writings with applause.  And lastly at that time began Christians to kill men for re<a id="l188"></a>ligion as you may see by  two sanguinary Edicts of Honorius against the Donatists &amp; all other <a id="l189"></a>African Roman  communion &amp; by the proceedings against them both before &amp; after. And whilst  the Donatists assembled in their churches were beseiged <a id="l191"></a>there &amp;  their churches burnt over their <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>heads<span class="nb-n">}</span></span></p>
<p id="par8">To these instances may be added the history of the Banishment of Chrysostom; <a id="l192"></a>the  carriage between Íerom &amp; Ruffin; the manners &amp; carriage of Peter Bishop <a id="l193"></a>of Alexandria described by Gregory Nazianzen; the wars between Basil &amp; <a id="l194"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="8 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> bishop of Tyana about the limits of their Bishopricks described by the same <a id="l195"></a>Gregory; the blood through which Pope Damasus waded to the Bishoprick of <a id="l196"></a>Rome touched upon by Ammianus &amp; some others &amp; fully described in the Libellus precum of <span class="hspac-n" title="Space left blank."></span>; The burning of the Churches of Constantinople &amp; Egypt; the  passionate and sometimes seditious writings of some of the greatest men &amp; their being approved of by the age: The  endeavours of the western Churches to exalt their  jurisdiction &amp;  authority above that of the <a id="l197"></a>Eastern,  &amp; that appeales should be made by all the world to the Bishop of <a id="l198"></a>Rome; The stirring up Emperor against Emperor  so as to <a id="l199"></a>endanger engaging them in a civil war about  Church concerns;  <a id="l200"></a>the strange  histories of the Councels of Tyre &amp; Sardica; &amp; the <a id="l201"></a>great inconstancy of the Romans in point of faith  they being carried about with <a id="l202"></a>every wind of doctrine  First the novel definitions of Arius <a id="l203"></a>met with such reception as to make him in a letter to Constantine  before the Councel of Nice boast <a id="l204"></a>of the multitude, then  upon the Emperors writing a publick letter <a id="l205"></a>against him to be  posted up in every city &amp; calling the Coun<a id="l206"></a>cel of Nice, they condemned him  almost unanimously &amp; at the Empe<a id="l207"></a>rors motion received the word  Consubstantial into their Creed. Then <a id="l208"></a> the wind turning again they at the Council of Ariminum  rejected the same word  as universally <a id="l209"></a> &amp; soon after upon a new turn of affairs  the west com<a id="l212"></a>plying with Valentinian &amp; Liberius,  the East  with   with Theodo<a id="l213"></a>sius; the same men in one Councel subscribing under oath to one thing in <a id="l214"></a>another to the contrary &amp; being allowed to do so. Which shews that the  age was perfectly such as Nazianzen describes it to be, ready for any side <a id="l216"></a>according to the turn of the times,  as ready to turn for interest to any <a id="l217"></a>Christian party as a little before from heathenism to Christianity  for the <a id="l218"></a>same interest. Whence we need not wonder  that in the short reign of <a id="l219"></a>Constantius over the west the world should turn so universally as to  occasion the proverb, Athanasius contra Mundum, &amp; make <a id="l221"></a>Nazianzen of opinion that Athanasius (soon after the death of Constantius) <a id="l222"></a>was the first that  by divine inspiration discovered &amp; manifested to the world the <a id="l223"></a>Deity of the Holy Ghost, the  Church in its more <a id="l224"></a>tender age not bearing with so great a mystery.</p>

<p id="par10">I hope I have now sufficiently proved that the  age from the first Conversion <a id="l226"></a>of the Empire to Christianity declined perpetually in manners by the influx of immora<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>l<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l227"></a>&amp; hypocritical heathens: so as within  a few years to  become as hypocritical &amp;  vitious as  our own times at least:  the most   immoral of the heathens being <a id="l230"></a>apt to turn first &amp;  so by their convers <a id="l231"></a>to make the  Christians  as  corrupt  at least as the heathens which remained <a id="l232"></a>unconverted. In shewing this I have insisted  most upon the manners of <a id="l233"></a>the Catholicks, there being no need to prove the corruptness of the rest. And <a id="l234"></a>whilst I compare those times with our own it makes me like our own the better <a id="l235"></a>&amp; honour our clergy the more, accounting them not only men of better morals  but also far more <a id="l236"></a>judicious &amp; knowing. Tis the nature of man to admire  least what he is  most <a id="l237"></a>acquainted with:  &amp; this makes us always think  our own times <a id="l238"></a>the worst. Men are not sainted till their  vices be forgotten.  The old heathens first commemorated their dead men then admired <a id="l240"></a>them, afterwards adored them as Gods, then raised them above newer Gods so as to make them Gods celestial &amp; at length equalled  the first of them <a id="l241"></a>to the supreme God,  as the Egyptians did Osiris, the Assyrians Baal, the Greeks Iupiter. </p>

<p id="par12">And whilst the Councel of Nice &amp; the Greeks universally understood the word <a id="l247"></a>homoüsius or consubstantial of two substances of like nature  the Latines translated it unius substantiæ  &amp; by one substance understood  one singular substance.  &amp; then accused the Greeks of <a id="l253"></a>Arianism for dividing the substances of the Father &amp; son &amp; the Greeks <a id="l254"></a>mutually accused the  Latines of Sabellianism for  making them one in <a id="l255"></a>  singular substance. Afterwards Constantius conquering the West <a id="l256"></a>&amp; bringing  both parties to confer together in Councels  <a id="l257"></a> the Latines   were made to understand the Councel of Nice better    <a id="l261"></a> nor did  the distinction of persons suffice <a id="l262"></a>to end all  dispute till in the councel of Alexandria the  latine <a id="l263"></a>language of one substance &amp; three persons was reconciled to the Greeke of <a id="l264"></a>one  usia   &amp; three hypostases  <a id="l265"></a>both being expounded of one substance in kind or nature &amp; three substantial persons  in <a id="l266"></a>number.  And at the same time the Greeks became <a id="l277"></a>divided &amp; subdivided into many parties: so great was the levity  of those times.] Thus easily <a id="l278"></a>did the Latines first vary from the Councel of Nice  &amp; then return to it <a id="l279"></a></p>
