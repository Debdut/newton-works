<div><p id="par1"> As for <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> rites, &amp; ceremonies  of the churches of the first ages  there was very great variety. <a id="l2"></a> in them  These things being indifferent in their <a id="l4"></a>nature the Apostles left the churches at liberty about them, &amp; every <a id="l5"></a>Church set her self such rules as she thought fit.  <a id="l6"></a> For Socrates &amp; Sozomen relate at large that in their days &amp; long before  there was great variety in the times of keeping Easter &amp; Lent, &amp; <a id="l7"></a>in the number of weeks &amp; days in the week in which they fasted in Lent &amp; <a id="l8"></a>in the sorts of meat from which they absteined in fasting, &amp; as great <a id="l9"></a>variety in the Collects, &amp; times of celebrating  the Eucharist &amp; in other circumstances of  <a id="l13"></a>worship so that to put in writing all the  rites  <a id="l14"></a>which were variously observed by the Churches in every city &amp; province, saith <a id="l15"></a>Socrates, would be very difficult or rather impossible. And yet the Churches kept in <a id="l16"></a>communion with one another notwithstanding all these differences. Men might vary in <a id="l17"></a>rites &amp; ceremonies,  They might vary  in opinions not necessary to Baptism. The union <a id="l18"></a>of the Church consisted in one faith. By one baptism into that faith, men were admitted <a id="l19"></a>into one church &amp; continued in it by living according to that faith.</p>
<p id="par2">Also auricular confession &amp; pennance  began to be in use soon after the  persecution of Decius &amp; were in use in almost all the Churches in <a id="l21"></a>the  latter end of the 4<sup>th</sup> century  untill a matron  in doing pennance in a Church  at Constantine was defiled by a Deacon  <a id="l23"></a>&amp; by confessing the crime brought a reflexion upon that Church, &amp;  <a id="l24"></a>thereupon Nectarius the Bishop of  Constantinople abolished  Confessors in that <a id="l25"></a>city, &amp; several other bishops followed his example in other cities.</p>
<p id="par3">Lucian the Martyr who suffered at Antioch in the 10<sup>th</sup> persecution A.C. 312 left a creed in writing <a id="l26"></a>which was subscribed by the Council of Antioch A.C. 341 &amp; again by the Council <a id="l27"></a>of Seleucia A.C. 359 &amp; is as follows. Credimus</p>
<p id="par4">We are not commanded in scripture to worship him as God Almighty (for by the  <a id="l28"></a>first commandment we are to have no other Gods in our  worship then him who  according to the fourth <a id="l29"></a>Commandment  made heaven &amp; earth &amp; the Sea) but we are to worship him &amp; give him honour &amp; glory in respect of <a id="l30"></a>his humanity. Because he humbled himself to death even the death of the cross there<a id="l31"></a>fore God hath highly exalted him &amp; given him a name above every name that at the name of Iesus every <a id="l32"></a>kne should bow,  of things in heaven &amp; earth &amp; under the earth &amp; that every tongue <a id="l33"></a>should confess that Iesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the father. <a id="l34"></a>We are therefore to bow to him as the Lord Iesus Christ the Prince of the kings of the earth. Vnto him that loved <a id="l35"></a>us &amp;  washed us from our sins in his own blood &amp; hath made us kings and Priests <a id="l36"></a>unto God even his father to him be glory &amp; dominion for ever &amp; ever. We are <a id="l37"></a>to worship him give him glory as the Lamb of God who  was slain for us</p>
<p id="par5">In all our prayers we must have but one God and one Mediator between God &amp; man the <a id="l38"></a>man Christ Iesus .. 2 In that day saith he ye shall ask me nothing, whatsoever ye <a id="l39"></a>shall <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ask<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the father in my name he will do it for you. 3 If we would have our petitions <a id="l40"></a>granted we must not neglect the mediatorship of the man Christ Iesus. By the <a id="l41"></a>first commandment we  are to have no other Gods then that God who accord<a id="l42"></a>ing to the fourth commandment made heaven &amp; earth, but we not forbidden <a id="l43"></a>to have a mediator between God and Man the Man Christ Iesus, we are <a id="l44"></a>not forbidden to have him for our Lord &amp; King or to give him that worship &amp; honour &amp; glory which is due to him  on that account. The Iews who were taught to  worship but one God <a id="l46"></a>were also taught to  expect a king &amp; the Christians are taught to worship <a id="l47"></a>the same God &amp; to beleive that Iesus is that King.  For they are to <em class="underline">beleive in one God  the father Almighty <a id="l48"></a>the maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp;  in one Lord Iesus Christ</em>. And if  he is their lord &amp; king they <a id="l49"></a>may certainly without idolatry give him that worship which is <span class="hspac-n" title="20 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <a id="l50"></a> due to him as their Lord &amp; king &amp;  it is their duty to give him such worship; not the <a id="l51"></a>worship of an ordinary king but  that which is due to him as the king of kings <a id="l52"></a>&amp; Lord of Lords,  the supreme king  over <a id="l53"></a>all the creation next under God Almighty, the King who sits at the right hand of <a id="l54"></a>God the father &amp; is therefore next to him in glory, the Lamb of God whose eyes are the <a id="l55"></a>seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth &amp; who alone of all beings in heaven &amp; earth <a id="l56"></a>&amp; under the earth was  worthy to receive the book of prophesy from the right hand of  God the father <a id="l57"></a>&amp;  whose testimony is the spirit of prophesy &amp; who is therefore called faithfull &amp; true witness &amp; the word of God, that is, his Oracle <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span> 
the express image or oracle of  the invisible God, [in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwelleth <a id="l58"></a>bodily,] whose testimony is the spirit of prohesy &amp; who is therefore called the faithful &amp; true <a id="l59"></a>witness &amp; the Word of God. To this great king, this visible image of the invisible we are <a id="l60"></a>to give suitable worship. We are not  to worship him as the God Almighty who created the <a id="l61"></a>heaven &amp; earth, (This would be to deny the father and the Son) but we are to worship <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>him<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> as the redeemer of the world the Lord Iesus Christ the Messiah , <a id="l62"></a>the Prince the mediator between God &amp; man the man Christ Iesus.<br><br></p>
<p id="par6">Thus the Creed in describing the persons of the father &amp; Son directs what worship <a id="l63"></a>we are to give to each. We must worship the father as  God, the Son as  Lord &amp; Christ <a id="l64"></a>the father as the father almighty the first author of all things who hath life &amp; all knowledge <a id="l65"></a>&amp; power in himself originally &amp; cannot dye the Son as the son of God who hath received life and knowledge &amp; <a id="l66"></a>power from the  will of the father &amp; was slain &amp; exalted to the right hand of God</p>
<p id="par7" class="i0">of things in heaven &amp; earth &amp; under the earth &amp; every tongue confess that Iesus <a id="l67"></a>Christ is Lord to the glory of God the father. All the worship which we are directed <a id="l68"></a>in scripture to give to Iesus Christ, respects his death &amp; exaltation  to the right hand of God &amp; is given <a id="l69"></a>to him as  Lord &amp; King &amp; tends to the glory of God the father. Should we give the Father <a id="l70"></a>that worship which is due to the Son we should <a id="l71"></a>be Patripassians &amp; should we give the Son that worship which is due to the father as  God  the <a id="l72"></a>father Almighty the creator of heaven &amp; earth our worship would not tend to the glory of God the father but injure him  &amp; we should be Idolaters &amp; in both <a id="l73"></a>cases we should practically deny the father and the Son. We must be careful there<a id="l74"></a>fore to give to each his proper worship, such a worship as is suitable to the character <a id="l75"></a>given to each  in the primitive Creed, &amp; then we are safe.  We may give blessing &amp; honour &amp; glory  &amp; power unto God &amp; the Lamb but <a id="l77"></a>it must be in different respects, to God as he is the father Almighty who created <a id="l78"></a>all things &amp; to the Lamb as he was slain for us &amp; washed away our sins in his own blood &amp; <a id="l79"></a>for humbling himself is now exalted to the right hand of God the Father.</p>

<p id="par9">Iesus Christ shall come to judge the quick &amp; the dead – He comes to judgement not <a id="l80"></a>from the right hand of God but from heaven. For he sits at the right hand of God not <a id="l81"></a>only in this world but also in that which is to come untill all enemies shall be put under his <a id="l82"></a>feet. And this we must beleive that we may pray for the coming of his kingdom</p>

<p id="par10">The article whose kingdom shall have no end is   equipollent to <a id="l83"></a>the article of <em class="underline">life everlasting</em> in the Creeds of the Latines,  <a id="l84"></a>exprest in the scriptures of both old &amp; new testament, prayed for in the Lords <a id="l85"></a>prayer,  expected by  Christians as the reward of  a good life <a id="l86"></a>&amp;  not liable to be disputed.</p>
