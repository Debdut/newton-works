<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">2 Kings 17.15, 16.</h2>
<p id="par1">They followed vanity &amp; became vain &amp; went after the heathen <a id="l1"></a>that were round about them, concerning whom the Lord had said <a id="l2"></a>that they should not do like them. And they left all the comman<a id="l3"></a>dements of the Lord their God, &amp; made them molten images even <a id="l4"></a>two Calves, &amp; made a grove &amp; worshipped all the host of <a id="l5"></a>Heaven &amp; served Baal.</p>
<p id="par2">This whole Chapter is spent in describing the captivity <a id="l6"></a>of the ten Tribes by the Assyrians; the abominations of the <a id="l7"></a>Israelites for which they were captivated; &amp; the religion <a id="l8"></a>of the nations which the Assyrians placed in Samaria in the <a id="l9"></a>Seats of the captivated Israelites; which religion was that these <a id="l10"></a>nations joyned together your worship of the true God in the <a id="l11"></a>Calves of Ieroboam, &amp; the worship of the fals Gods of <a id="l12"></a>Gentiles round about in their  several Idols, even as <a id="l13"></a>the Israelites had joyned them before. But the words I <a id="l14"></a>have chosen to discourse on are a part of the description <a id="l15"></a>of the abomination of the Israelites which these nations <a id="l16"></a>imitated.  complaining how they followed vainly &amp; <a id="l17"></a>became vain by forsaking the commandements of the Lord <a id="l18"></a>to make molten images even two Calves, &amp; worshipping <a id="l19"></a>all the host of Heaven &amp; serving Baal. &amp; going after the <a id="l20"></a>heathen that were round about them. Now this com<a id="l21"></a>prehending both the worship of Ieroboams Calves dedi<a id="l22"></a>cated (as I shall shew) to the trew God, &amp; also the <a id="l23"></a>worship of other Idols dedicated to the Gods of the Nations <a id="l24"></a>round about: we have here an opportunity to consi<a id="l25"></a>der Idolatry in its full latitude &amp; to discourse of its <a id="l26"></a>nature in general : ffor which end I shall in the <a id="l27"></a>first place propound the six following particulars.</p>
<p id="par3">ffirst that the Israelites acknowledged &amp; worshipped <a id="l28"></a>the true God at the same time that they worshipped the <a id="l29"></a>Gods of the Gentiles. Secondly that they &amp; the nations <a id="l30"></a>which succeeded them in the cities of Samaria worshipped the true God <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> in the calves of Ieroboam. Thirdly that this worship was <a id="l31"></a>Idolatry notwithstanding that it was performed to the true God: <a id="l32"></a>&amp; by parity of reason, that the worship of the true God by <a id="l33"></a>any Image which he has not commanded  (as indeed <a id="l34"></a>he has commanded none) is Idolatry. ffourthly that generally <a id="l35"></a>the Israelites &amp; Gentiles worshipped not mere Images as Gods <a id="l36"></a>themselves but only as dedicated to their severall gods. <a id="l37"></a>ffiftly that those Idolaters who acknowledged the true God, <a id="l38"></a>did not esteem any of their other Gods equal to him but <a id="l39"></a>accounted them only finite beings, &amp; for the most part <a id="l40"></a>the soules of men  deceased who for the eminent  <a id="l41"></a>passage of their life here, they supposed were after death rewarded with <a id="l42"></a>power more or less over this world, to do good or hurt therein subordinatly <a id="l43"></a> not only to the supreme God but even to some others of their <a id="l44"></a>imagined Gods. Lastly that the Glory of the true God which <a id="l45"></a> Idolaters gave unto their Idols, was not any of his attributes <a id="l46"></a>as some are ready to suppose, but only this: To love, fear, trust in, <a id="l47"></a>&amp; seek unto those Gods for the temporal blessings of this <a id="l48"></a>life, for which the true God has appointed us to love fear <a id="l49"></a>trust in &amp; seek unto none but himself immediately. To <a id="l50"></a>celebrate God for his eternity  immensity omniscien<a id="l51"></a>cy &amp; omnipotency is indeed  very pious  &amp; the duty of every creature to do it according to  capacity, but yet this part of <a id="l53"></a>Gods glory, as it – – – –   almost transcends the comprehension of man so <a id="l54"></a> it springs not from the  freedom of  Gods will but <a id="l55"></a>from the necessity of his nature. And as the wisest of men <a id="l56"></a>delight not so much to be commended for their height of birth <a id="l57"></a>strength of body, bewty, strong memory, large fantasy, or other <a id="l58"></a>such gifts of nature as for their wise good &amp; great actions <a id="l59"></a>the issues of their will so the wisest of beings requires of us <a id="l60"></a>to be celebrated not so much for his essence as  for  his actions, the creating preserving &amp; governing all things according to his good will &amp; pleasure. The <a id="l62"></a>wisdome power goodness &amp; justice which he always exerts in his <a id="l63"></a>actions are his glory which he stands so much upon, &amp; is so jea<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span>lous of. These are that glory  which the Prophets &amp; Apostles <a id="l64"></a>from one end of the scriptures unto the other &amp; especially the Psalmist so much cele<a id="l65"></a>brate, the only glory by which God manifests himself to his <a id="l66"></a>creatures,  &amp; which his Creatures are able to behold <a id="l67"></a>in him, the reason why his creatures worship him, &amp; the <a id="l68"></a>life &amp; soule of all the worship we can give him: &amp; there<a id="l69"></a>fore no wonder he is so extreamly jealous of his honour <a id="l70"></a>in this point even to the least tittle. As for his attributes <a id="l71"></a>he knows those can scarce be given to any other, because <a id="l72"></a>so soon as men do ascribe any  of his attributes to any <a id="l73"></a>thing they worship, they doe thereby mean the supreme God; <a id="l74"></a>though perhaps in other respects they may have a deformed no<a id="l75"></a>tion of him, as indeed the best notions any of us have of him are imperfect enough: but for his works, many of those may &amp; have <a id="l76"></a>been &amp; still are too frequently ascribed to his creatures, the <a id="l77"></a>deified Heroes with their Idols among the Gentiles, &amp; the saints <a id="l78"></a>with their reliques &amp; images among too many Christians. And <a id="l79"></a>therefore they that think the Idolatry of the Heathens to <a id="l80"></a>consist in giving any other part of God's honour &amp; glory than <a id="l81"></a>that of his works to their Idols are mistaken, &amp; they that <a id="l82"></a>begin to give any of this his glory to angels or saints, or to their <a id="l83"></a>images or the reliques of martyrs or the like, begin to give <a id="l84"></a>God's glory to another to whom it belongs not after the same manner that the Idola<a id="l85"></a>trous Israelites &amp; those Gentiles did who worshipped the true God &amp; fals<a id="l86"></a>Gods together.</p>
<p id="par4">These are the six heads I intend to discourse of, &amp; When I have run through them  I intend for a <a id="l87"></a>conclusion to lay down out of scripture the notion of a fals <a id="l88"></a>God, of an Idol, &amp; of Idolatry: To do which is my chief <a id="l89"></a>designe because men are so much wanting in this notion <a id="l90"></a>that they scarce know what to apply Idolatry to besides <a id="l91"></a>those particular cases of the  Heathens to which the Prophets <a id="l92"></a>themselves applyed it. But before I do this I have thoug<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ht<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l93"></a>it not amiss to premise the six preceding particulars: which I <a id="l94"></a>do, not as if I intended them for necessary foundations of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> what I chiefly aim at but only as convenient to prepare the <a id="l95"></a>way.</p>
<p id="par5">The first was that the Israelites worshipped the true God <a id="l96"></a>together with the Gods of the Gentiles. Now this is very plain <a id="l97"></a>by the history of this chapter: for  so soon as the <a id="l98"></a>Israelites were carried away captive, &amp; the other nations placed <a id="l99"></a>in their stead in the cities of Samaria, it's said <em class="underline">that at the <a id="l100"></a>beginning of their dwelling there they feared not the Lord <a id="l101"></a>&amp; therefore the Lord sent Lyons among them which slew some <a id="l102"></a>of them. Wherefore they spake to the King of Assyria saying <a id="l103"></a>The nations which thou hast removed &amp; placed in the cities of <a id="l104"></a>Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the Land: there<a id="l105"></a>fore he hath sent Lyons among them &amp; behold they slay <a id="l106"></a>them because they know not the manner of the God of the <a id="l107"></a>Land. Then the king of Assyria commanded saying carry <a id="l108"></a>thither one of the Priests whome ye brought from thence, <a id="l109"></a>&amp; let them go &amp; dwell there &amp; let him teach them the  <a id="l110"></a>manner of the God of the Land. Then one of the Priests whome they <a id="l111"></a>had carried away from Samaria came &amp; dwelt in Bethel &amp; <a id="l112"></a>taught them how they should feare the Lord. Howbeit every <a id="l113"></a>nation made Gods of their own – – – – So they feared the <a id="l114"></a>Lord &amp; served their own Gods after the manner of the na<a id="l115"></a>tions whome they carried away from thence</em>.  [Now the <a id="l116"></a>Lord which these nations were here taught to fear was most <a id="l117"></a>plainly the true God: first because the name by which he <a id="l118"></a>is called in the hebrew is Iehovah a name given to none <a id="l119"></a>but the true God: ffor in vers 28 it is said that <em class="underline">one of <a id="l120"></a>the Priests whome they carried away from  Samaria <a id="l121"></a>came &amp; dwelt in Samaria &amp; taught them how they should <a id="l122"></a>fear Iehovah</em>, &amp; in vers 32 <em class="underline">So they feared Iehovah &amp; made <a id="l123"></a>unto themselves of the lowest of them priests</em>, &amp; in vers 33 <a id="l124"></a><em class="underline">they feared Iehovah &amp; served their own Gods</em> &amp; lastly in vers <a id="l125"></a>41 <em class="underline">So these nations feared Iehovah &amp; served their graven</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span><sup class="note" id="ed1-ref">[Editorial&nbsp;Note&nbsp;1]</sup> principal places of Idolatry, &amp; yet when they came up <a id="l126"></a>to these to perform their Idolatrous worship, they used to <a id="l127"></a>swear <em class="underline">The word liveth</em>, that is the true God of Israel <a id="l128"></a>liveth for the Hebrew word which we here translate Lord <a id="l129"></a>is Iehova, a word which never signifies any other then <a id="l130"></a>the true God, &amp; which it seems was hitherto commonly used <a id="l131"></a>not only by the Prophets (as we find it in their writings) but <a id="l132"></a><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>now<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> by the people, though after the Captivity if the Rabbies say true it became so <a id="l133"></a>superstitiously reverenced, that it was made death for any to <a id="l134"></a>name it but the high Priest, &amp; he too did it only in the <a id="l135"></a>Temple once a year in a solemn benediction of the people: <a id="l136"></a>which superstition  might rise from the Prophets <a id="l137"></a> <a id="l138"></a>interdicting here the use of this name as it might seem absolutely, <a id="l139"></a>though I suppose he meant only that evil use of it which <a id="l140"></a>Israel then practised. <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But however, seing Israel used <a id="l141"></a>to swear by the true God Iehovah when they came up to <a id="l142"></a>do their abominations at the said cities Gilgal &amp; Bethaven <a id="l143"></a>its plain that they acknowledged &amp; respected the true God <a id="l144"></a>in the midst of their abominations in the time of the Pro<a id="l145"></a>phet Hosea,  which was a little before they were captivated <a id="l146"></a>by the Assyrians, for Hosea wrote about 50 or 60 years <a id="l147"></a>before that captivity.</p>
<p id="par6">Now because God is so much offended at their swearing <a id="l148"></a>Iehova liveth as to mention it emphatically as a grand <a id="l149"></a>crime which Israel committed when she went up to her <a id="l150"></a>cities of worship, &amp; to forbid Iudah to do the like, &amp; yet <a id="l151"></a>they were not interdicted under the law to make solemn oaths <a id="l152"></a>or vows in his name, but only to break them once made: <a id="l153"></a>one may presume there was some further grand mystery <a id="l154"></a>in these oaths, &amp; what that was will I conceive appear by <a id="l155"></a>comparing this place of Osea with Ier 44.25, 26, where a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> hand of  Iews<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>  which in the time of Nebuchadnezzars <a id="l156"></a>captivity fled into Egypt vowed in the name of the Lord to wor<a id="l157"></a>ship the Queen of heaven. The words run thus. Hear the <a id="l158"></a>word of the Lord all Iudah that are in the Land of Egypt <a id="l159"></a>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, saying, Ye <a id="l160"></a>&amp; your wives have both spoken with your mouth &amp; fulfilled <a id="l161"></a>with your hands, saying, We will surely perform our vows that <a id="l162"></a>we have vowed to burn incense to the Queen of heaven &amp; <a id="l163"></a>to pour out drink offrings unto her: ye will surely accom<a id="l164"></a>plish your vows &amp; surely perform your vows. Therefore hear <a id="l165"></a>ye the word of the Lord all Iudah that dwell in the Land of <a id="l166"></a>Egypt, Behold I have sworn by my great name saith the <a id="l167"></a>Lord that my name shall be no more named in the mouth <a id="l168"></a>of any man of Iudah in all the Land of Egypt, saying, the <a id="l169"></a>Lord God liveth. Now concerning this place you may note <a id="l170"></a>first that these Iews when they were in the Land of Egypt <a id="l171"></a>worshippers of the Queen of heaven,  used  <a id="l172"></a>to invoke &amp; sweare by the true God as the Israelites did before <a id="l173"></a>at Gilgal &amp; Bethaven saying <em class="underline">the Lord God liveth</em>: And there<a id="l174"></a>fore in the midst of their abominations in Egypt retained a <a id="l175"></a>memory of &amp; respect unto the true God. And so we have <a id="l176"></a>here an example of the Iews falling into gross Idolatry <a id="l177"></a>without forsaking the true God as we had before of the Is<a id="l178"></a>raelites. And such an example too as makes it probable <a id="l179"></a>that Iudah never forsook the true God seing these men <a id="l180"></a>lived when Idolatry was grown to the height, &amp; quoted the <a id="l181"></a>practice of their forefathers for what they did, &amp; seeme <a id="l182"></a>to have been as degenerate as any, obstinately refusing to obey <a id="l183"></a>Ieremiah whom God sent unto them, &amp; not desisting till God <a id="l184"></a>cut them off in Egypt as he had newly done their idolatrous <a id="l185"></a>brethren at Ierusalem of whom they were an escaped rem<a id="l186"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span>nant. Secondly it is to be noted that the vowes here made were <a id="l187"></a>not extemporary oaths or protestations but solemn vows: for <a id="l188"></a>upon being reproved for their Idolatry they said, surely we <a id="l189"></a>will perform our vows which we have vowed to burn incense <a id="l190"></a>to the Queen of heaven. Thirdly by Gods threatning that his <a id="l191"></a>name should be no more named by any man of Iudah in all <a id="l192"></a>Egypt is not meant a withdrawing of the remembrance of <a id="l193"></a>his name from them but a cutting them off for their <a id="l194"></a>abominable prophaning his name, for in the next vers <a id="l195"></a>he adds the manner of it saying Behold I will watch over <a id="l196"></a>them for evil &amp; not for good, &amp; all the men of Iudah <a id="l197"></a>that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the <a id="l198"></a>sword &amp; by the famin untill there be an end of them. <a id="l199"></a>Fourthly it is to be noted that the reason why God  threat<a id="l200"></a>ned that his name should be no more thus named in Egypt <a id="l201"></a>by them was because they <em class="underline">vowed</em> to burn incense to the <a id="l202"></a>Queen of heaven. Because  while they sware by his <a id="l203"></a>name they made such exerable vows as these, there<a id="l204"></a>fore God threatens they should swear by his name no <a id="l205"></a>longer but be cut off. Their swearing by Gods name <a id="l206"></a>has here a special relation to their vows to commit <a id="l207"></a>wickednes: for God does not say in general: Because ye <a id="l208"></a>worship the Queen of heaven therefore I will be no longer <a id="l209"></a>your god; but because ye have made such wicked vows <a id="l210"></a>as these are therefore ye shall be cut of that ye <a id="l211"></a>may use my name no longer to swear by. This there<a id="l212"></a>fore was their sin of swearing by his name that they <a id="l213"></a>sware solemnly by it to commit their abominations: when <a id="l214"></a>it is evident that they accounted him their proper &amp; principal God.<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> </p>
<p id="par7">To proceed  on to some further considerations: the <a id="l215"></a>truth of the assertion that Israel worshipped the true God <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> fals Gods together may appear by considering the designe <a id="l216"></a>of Ieroboams proceeding when he set up the calves to be <a id="l217"></a>worshipped. for the worship which he instituted continued till <a id="l218"></a>the time of the Captivity, that short persecution of Iezebel per<a id="l219"></a>haps only excepted, &amp; therefore was the same with that ex<a id="l220"></a>ercised next before the persecution, only with this difference that <a id="l221"></a>they were then become more abominable by adding forreign <a id="l222"></a>Gods to the calves. For in the history of their Captivity it is <a id="l223"></a>said that the Children of Israel walked in all the sins <a id="l224"></a>of Ieroboam which he did, they departed not from them till he removed <a id="l225"></a>Israel  out of his sight. Now I would have you con<a id="l226"></a>sider that when Ieroboam made this change in religion <a id="l227"></a>he had no further design in it then to confirm the kingdom <a id="l228"></a>to himself &amp; for that end to keep the people from going <a id="l229"></a>up to Ierusalem to worship there least their hearts should <a id="l230"></a>turn again toward their brethren there &amp; so they should <a id="l231"></a>slay him &amp; return again to Rehoboam. This is the reason set <a id="l232"></a>down in the history, &amp; therefore it is not likely that he <a id="l233"></a>should go about to make any further change in religi<a id="l234"></a>on then was requisite to stay the people from going up <a id="l235"></a>to Ierusalem it being against all rules of policy for <a id="l236"></a>a king to make any unnecessary changes in his kingdom. <a id="l237"></a>But the fundamental change of their God was no <a id="l238"></a>way requisite for this, &amp; therefore it is not at all likely <a id="l239"></a>that he should go about to attempt that, especially, since <a id="l240"></a>that being the greatest change that could be made in re<a id="l241"></a>ligion, it could not but have been a very dangerous &amp; scarce <a id="l242"></a>feasible attempt to do it so on a suddein, as we may easily <a id="l243"></a>apprehend by the obstinacy with which all nations adhere to <a id="l244"></a>their perswasions. To have attempted it by force might <a id="l245"></a>have put all into confusion &amp; rebellion, especially in a <a id="l246"></a>nation so unsetled, &amp; to have attempted it by perswasive <a id="l247"></a>arguing against their God, would more probably have made <a id="l248"></a>them stone the disputers for blasphemers of their God then con<a id="l249"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span>vinced them. It is not likely therefore that he went about <a id="l250"></a>to change any more than the place &amp; so much of the mode of <a id="l251"></a>their worship as might make them disaffected to the way of worship <a id="l252"></a>at Ierusalem &amp; so confirm their worship to other places. And <a id="l253"></a>this he might do by sophistry causing it to be put into their <a id="l254"></a>heads, that to worship at Ierusalem was but an innovation <a id="l255"></a>seeing their forefathers worshipped in other places, &amp; Iacob <a id="l256"></a>in particular at Bethel where he put one of the calves. <a id="l257"></a>That theire Temple also was  but a new device of Solomon, &amp; that <a id="l258"></a>the calves might be the place of Gods special  <a id="l259"></a>presence as well as the Cherubins over the Ark at Ierusalem whose<a id="l260"></a>lower parts had the same figure &amp; that there was as much <a id="l261"></a>reason why God might be worshipped before the one as <a id="l262"></a>before the other. With some such sophistry as this I am <a id="l263"></a>the more apt to think that they maintained all along <a id="l264"></a>their worship against the Iews because I find the woman <a id="l265"></a>of Samaria (one of the posterity  of them &amp; of the <a id="l266"></a>nations which succeeding them continued their worship) I find <a id="l267"></a>I say this woman arguing after  this manner with our <a id="l268"></a>Saviour: Our fathers worshipped in this mountain &amp; ye <a id="l269"></a>say that in Ierusalem is the place where men ought to <a id="l270"></a>worship.</p>
<p id="par8">Further as it is improbable  on the account of policy that <a id="l271"></a>Ieroboam should change their God, so also by this circum<a id="l272"></a>stance of the history that God reccons it among his crimes that to these Calves he made Priests <a id="l273"></a>of the lowest of the people which were not of the sons of <a id="l274"></a>Levi: for (as I have said of the like Priests which the <a id="l275"></a>heathen successors of the Israelites made to the true God in <a id="l276"></a>Samaria) had these Priests been dedicated to any other <a id="l277"></a>God then the true one in the calves, the crime would have been to <a id="l278"></a>make Priests of the highest of the people &amp; of the tribe <a id="l279"></a>of Levi because the first would have been a giving <a id="l280"></a>the greater honour to a fals God, the last a sacrilegi<a id="l281"></a>ous  violation of Gods special institution &amp; privilege to have <a id="l282"></a>that Tribe Priests to himself.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span>
<p id="par9">Much after the same manner one may argue from  <a id="l283"></a>Amos 4.4 where their worship is reprehended for devia<a id="l284"></a>ting in some things from the ceremonies of the law. Come to Bethel,  <a id="l285"></a> &amp; transgress, at Gilgal multiply trangession, <a id="l286"></a>&amp; bring your sacrifices every morning, &amp; your tiths <a id="l287"></a>after three years, &amp; offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving <a id="l288"></a>with leaven &amp; proclaim &amp; publish the free offerings: for <a id="l289"></a>this liketh you o ye children of Israel saith the Lord God <a id="l290"></a>Here you may see that Israel retained the worship of the Law <a id="l291"></a>at Bethel &amp; Gilgal, the chief places of their transgression, <a id="l292"></a>but not exactly: for they offered a sacrifice of thanksgiving <a id="l293"></a>with leaven, which was instituted to be without Leaven as you may <a id="l294"></a>see in Levit. 7.12. Now whereas God upbraids them for <a id="l295"></a>this, certainly he would never have upbraided them for <a id="l296"></a>not observing the circumstances of his law towards any other <a id="l297"></a>God then himself.</p>
<p id="par10">But to make the business yet more plain, there is <a id="l298"></a>in the next chapter  an express declaration of their per<a id="l299"></a>forming this their worship to the true God &amp; his refusal <a id="l300"></a>to accept of it. Tis the 5<sup>t</sup> Ch. of Amos the 21<sup>th</sup> vers, <a id="l301"></a>which I pray you mind. The words run thus. I hate, I <a id="l302"></a>despise your feast days &amp; I will not smell in your solemn <a id="l303"></a>Assemblies. Though ye offer me burnt offerings &amp; your <a id="l304"></a>meat offerings I will not accept them, neither will I re<a id="l305"></a>gard the peace offerings of your fatt beasts. Take thou away <a id="l306"></a>from me the noise of thy songs, for I will not hear the <a id="l307"></a>melody of thy viols. This respects the national worship of <a id="l308"></a>the ten Tribes during the standing of  the calves: for the discourse begins with a  <a id="l309"></a>lamentation against Israel for what they did at Bethel <a id="l310"></a>Gilgal &amp; Beersheba, &amp; ends with a threatning them the <a id="l311"></a>captivity by the Assyrians which happened about three or four <a id="l312"></a>score years after</p>
<p id="par11">To all these   things I might yet add more were it necessary<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup>  <a id="l313"></a>As the great number of the Lords Prophets that were in Is<a id="l314"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span>rael. For in Ahabs reign besides the many Prophets which Iezebel <a id="l315"></a>slew, there were an hundred saved in a cave: &amp; it's not at <a id="l316"></a>all likely that Prophets should abound so very much in a kingdom <a id="l317"></a>in which the name of the Lord by which they prophesied was not <a id="l318"></a>acknowledged. The comparison of the greatnes of the sin <a id="l319"></a>of worshipping the calves with that of worshipping the Gods of <a id="l320"></a>the Gentiles might be also considered. ffor the sin of the calves <a id="l321"></a>though great enough is yet  represented less then that <a id="l322"></a>of worshipping Baal. ffor of Ahab, (the first king of Israel <a id="l323"></a>that added the Idolatries of the Heathens to the sin of Ieroboam) <a id="l324"></a>it is said that he did evil above all before him, &amp; as if it <a id="l325"></a>had been a light thing to walk in the sins of Ieroboam, <a id="l326"></a>he went &amp; served Baal &amp; worshipped him. And afterward <a id="l327"></a>of Iehoram the son of  Ahab, for abolishing Baal <a id="l328"></a>it is said that he wrought evil in the sight of the Lord but <a id="l329"></a>not like his ffather, for he put away the Image of Baal <a id="l330"></a>that his ffather had made, nevertheless he cleaved to the <a id="l331"></a>sin of Ieroboam. Tell me now on what account the <a id="l332"></a>sin of Ieroboam should be thus esteemed less then that <a id="l333"></a>of worshipping Baal, unless it be this that in the former <a id="l334"></a>case the Idol was dedicated to the true God, in the latter <a id="l335"></a>to a fals one? ffor certainly the sins are equal, to <a id="l336"></a>worship any of the Gentile Gods.</p>
<p id="par12">Again the history of Iehu is very remarkable. for this <a id="l337"></a>king destroyed Baal out of Israel, &amp; that in vindication of <a id="l338"></a>the worship against Baal. ffor when he had gathered the <a id="l339"></a>Priests of Baal together to slay them he caused a search <a id="l340"></a>to be made to see if any of the Priests of the Lord <a id="l341"></a>were among them, for fear they should perish with the rest,<a id="l342"></a>&amp; for this his zeale in God's cause, &amp; for destroying also <a id="l343"></a>the house of Ahab for their worshipping Baal, God was <a id="l344"></a>so well pleased with him, that he said, Because thou hast <a id="l345"></a>done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span> thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne <a id="l346"></a>of Israel: And yet  all this while Iehu continued  <a id="l347"></a>in the sins of Ieroboam like the rest of the Kings of Israel. <a id="l348"></a>as 'tis expresly testified of him.</p>
<p id="par13">Thus much may suffice to manifest the first particular <a id="l349"></a>That Israel worshipped the true God together with their fals <a id="l350"></a>ones. The next particular was that  <a id="l351"></a>the true God was worshipped in the Calves of Ieroboam <a id="l352"></a>And of this I have occasionally said something already in arguing from <a id="l353"></a>Ieroboam's policy in the institution, from the reprehension <a id="l354"></a>of his making Priests to these calves out of the lowest of <a id="l355"></a>the people which were not Levites, from their observing <a id="l356"></a>the legal ceremonies in their worship at Bethel where <a id="l357"></a>the calf was, &amp; being upbraided by God for not ob<a id="l358"></a>serving them fully, &amp; from the sin of the Calves being <a id="l359"></a>less then that of worshipping the Gods of the Gentiles.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p013r"> &lt;13r&gt; </span><sup class="note" id="ed2-ref">[Editorial&nbsp;Note&nbsp;2]</sup>
<p id="par14" class="i0">I say rather pas on to say a word or on my second &amp; 3<sup>d</sup> <a id="l360"></a>Proposition that I may not leave my discourse altogether imperfect <a id="l361"></a>The second was that  the true God was worshipped in the <a id="l362"></a>calves.  And of this I have occasionally said something already in <a id="l363"></a> arguing from Ieroboam's policy in the institution from the  repre<a id="l364"></a>hension of his making Priests to these calves out of the lowest of <a id="l365"></a>the people which were not Levites, from their  observing <a id="l366"></a>the legal ceremonies in their worship at Bethel where the <a id="l367"></a>calf was, &amp; being  upbraided by God for <a id="l368"></a>not observing them fully; from the sin of the calves being less <a id="l369"></a>then that of worshipping the Gods of the Gentiles.  I may add that <a id="l370"></a>the worship of the calves was their national religion &amp; conse<a id="l371"></a>quently the same with the worship of the true God which was also <a id="l372"></a>their national religion. But the proclamation of Ieroboam <a id="l373"></a>Behold thy Gods o Israel which brought the up out of the land <a id="l374"></a>of Egypt makes it plain. For hereby it's certain that they <a id="l375"></a>worshipped none other for the true God then him whom <a id="l376"></a>they worshipped in these calves. The expression indeed <a id="l377"></a>runs as if they meant the very calves to be that God but <a id="l378"></a>this was but according to a mode of speaking familiar among <a id="l379"></a>them ffor as they used to call  all Images Baal which <a id="l380"></a>were dedicated to Baal &amp; all other Images  <a id="l381"></a>by the names of the Gods to which they were dedicated, so <a id="l382"></a>they called these Calves by the  title of  their own God be<a id="l383"></a>cause dedicated to him. Thus you may see in the 17 chapter <a id="l384"></a>of Iudges  though Micah's Mother (as tis expresly said) dedicated <a id="l385"></a>eleven hundred sheckels of silver to make a molten Image <a id="l386"></a>&amp; a graven Image to Iehovah for her son Micah &amp; accordingly <a id="l387"></a>made two images thereof &amp; placed them in the house of  Micah &amp; Micah worshipped Iehovah in them getting <a id="l389"></a>a Levite to be his Priest &amp; saying Now I know Iehovah will <a id="l390"></a>do me good seeing I have a Levite to be my Priest: yet the <a id="l391"></a> history calls these Images his Gods saying that he had <a id="l392"></a>a house of Gods: And Micah himself also calls them his Gods <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013v"> &lt;13v&gt; </span> saying to the Danites who took them away, Ye have taken away <a id="l393"></a>my Gods which I made.  The <a id="l394"></a>case is much like one  familiar with all the world.  When We say be<a id="l395"></a>hold this or that man who did  any action,  nothing can be <a id="l396"></a>beheld but his body &amp; yet we speak it with reference to his soule <a id="l397"></a>the principle of the action: And so when they  said Behold thy <a id="l398"></a>God which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt though nothing could <a id="l399"></a>be beheld but the Calf, yet their calling it a god must refer to <a id="l400"></a>the special invisible presence of the God which they supposed in it  especially seeing all Israell knew that their God brought them out <a id="l403"></a>of the Land of Egypt long before the Calf was made.</p>
<p id="par15">The third Proposition was that the worship of those <a id="l404"></a>calves was Idolatry notwithstanding that  the true <a id="l405"></a>God was worshipped in them, though not so heighnous Idolatry. as the worshipping Baal &amp; other Gods of the Gentiles. Now  this will sufficiently <a id="l406"></a>appeare out of these two or three places. Hosea 8.4 Of their <a id="l407"></a>silver &amp; their Gold they have made them Idols that they may <a id="l408"></a>be cut of. Thy calf o Samaria hath cast the off. the workman made it therefore it is not God. But the Calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces Here God <a id="l409"></a> tells them first in general that they made Idols to cut <a id="l410"></a>them of &amp; then instances in the Calf telling them it was  a fals God. So Hosea 13.2 They <a id="l411"></a>have made them  molten images of their silver &amp; Idols according to their <a id="l412"></a>own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen, they say of <a id="l413"></a>them let the men that sacrifice kiss the Calves; they say  of them that is <a id="l414"></a>of the Idols  they made let the sacrifices kiss the Calves. So that <a id="l415"></a>here you see calves with other images altogether called Idols. <a id="l416"></a>which is all one as to call their worship Idolatry. Again in Hosea 4.15 <a id="l417"></a>Though thou Israel play the Harlot yet let not Israel offend <a id="l418"></a>come not ye unto Gilgal neither go ye up to Bethaven. Here <a id="l419"></a>Israel is called a Harlot which is as much  as to say a com<a id="l420"></a>mitter of Idolatry &amp; the places where she did it are Gilgal &amp; <a id="l421"></a>Bethaven whereof Bethaven I  shewed you was Bethel the city  <a id="l422"></a>called Bethaven that is the house of the Idols because  Ieroboam  had placed one of the Calves. there ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 14v &gt; </span> vers. pag. ✝ there. And so in Hos. 10.8 when the Prophet had newly mentioned <a id="l423"></a>the calves of Bethaven or Bethel, he subjoynes The  high places of Aven the sin of Israel <a id="l425"></a>shal be destroyed that is the high places or Altars of the Idols. For Aven <a id="l426"></a>is one of the usual names  for an Idol &amp; so the vulgar <a id="l427"></a>translation  translates.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 13v resumes &gt; </span> Lastly in 1 Kings 14.9 God <a id="l428"></a>tells Ieroboam  Thou hast done evil above all that were be<a id="l429"></a>fore the, for thou hast gone &amp; made thee other Gods even <a id="l430"></a>molten Images to provoke me to anger &amp; hast cast me behind <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> thy back God  here calls these calves <a id="l431"></a> other Gods which is all one as to call their worship Idolatry, &amp; good reason. For though  Israel supposed Gods special <a id="l432"></a>presence in them to heare their prayers &amp; accept their worship  yet <a id="l433"></a>they were deceived, God was not there, they were mere unprofitable <a id="l434"></a>vanities, to which God was a stranger;  they were not filled with <a id="l435"></a>his presence as Israel supposed out other Gods,  mere vanities, &amp; their worship vain <a id="l436"></a>&amp; idolatrous. Had God commanded  such an Image &amp; promised that he would <a id="l437"></a> place his special be present in  it &amp; accept of their <a id="l438"></a>worship done before it as done to him, such worship would have <a id="l439"></a>been  necessary profitable &amp; pious, but since  they made  it of <a id="l440"></a>their own heads  twas   a strange and an empty thing another God which he had nothing to do <a id="l441"></a>with, &amp; the worship of it  disobedience  vanity &amp; Idolatry.</p>
<p id="par16">Now  if it be Idolatry to  worship the true <a id="l443"></a>God  by  an Image you may hence learn these two things first that <a id="l445"></a>Idolatry according to the old meaning of the word comprehends not <a id="l446"></a>only the worshipp given to  an  Idol  ultimately but also that <a id="l447"></a>given through an Idol to the God to which the Idol is dedicated, that <a id="l448"></a>is not only worship.  of an Idol but also worship by an Idol is <a id="l449"></a>Idolatry, Or that an image becomes an Idol so far as we <a id="l450"></a>worship either it or any thing by it. And secondly you may <a id="l451"></a>learn hence the  great extent of the 2<sup>d</sup> Commandement <a id="l452"></a>ffor if it interdict the making of an image to God him <a id="l453"></a>self, much more  must it to any thing els. So that <a id="l454"></a>comparing both these  things I see not how any image worship can <a id="l455"></a>be excused. Lastly the excuse of some  pleading they are Christians &amp; terminate their <a id="l457"></a>worship on God, is hereby cut of. ffor   if this <a id="l458"></a>would not excuse the Israelites who were Gods people &amp; <a id="l459"></a>directed their worship ultimately to him as  much as they  do, how <a id="l460"></a>can it excuse them. Of the two they are the more guilty <a id="l461"></a>for they go a step futher out of the way, &amp; double <a id="l462"></a>the crime by transmitting their worship first through ima<a id="l463"></a>ges to the soules of dead men &amp; then through the soules of dead <a id="l464"></a>men to God</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p015r"> &lt;15r&gt; </span>
<p id="par17">By this history it is easy to collect that the  God of the Land <a id="l465"></a>which the new nations were taught to worship in the cities of Sa<a id="l466"></a>maria was the true God, &amp; that this same God had been <a id="l467"></a>worshipped  by the kingdom of Israel, even amidst the worst <a id="l468"></a>of their idolatries, as the God of their Land, till the very time of <a id="l469"></a>the captivity. But this though it be plain enough of it self <a id="l470"></a>yet I intend the next time to point at the particular marks <a id="l471"></a>by which it is put beyond all cavil; &amp; not only so but to shew <a id="l472"></a>out of sacred history by examples in ages before Ieroboam's time that <a id="l473"></a>the Israelites &amp; their forefathers used not to forsake the true <a id="l474"></a>God when they fell into Idolatry but only to joyne to his wor<a id="l475"></a>ship the adoration of the Gods of the Gentiles as these did since <a id="l476"></a>Ieroboam. And this I shall do that it may appear that Is<a id="l477"></a>rael during all her abominations from first to last scarce <a id="l478"></a>ever forsook the true God   absolutely but only corrupted his worship by min<a id="l479"></a>gling their own inventions with it as too many of our neigh<a id="l480"></a>bouring christians dayly do. Which corruptions if they be at <a id="l481"></a>any time called a forsaking of God, no more need be under<a id="l482"></a>stood by that but a forsaking of his laws. <br><br></p>
<p id="par18">T. g. o. o. L. I. C. &amp; t. l. o. G. &amp; t. f. o. t. H G.<sup class="note" id="ed3-ref">[Editorial&nbsp;Note&nbsp;3]</sup> be with <a id="l483"></a>us all evermore. Amen. <br><br></p>
<p id="par19">The first of the six Propositions which I laid down from <a id="l484"></a>hence was that the Idolatrous Israelites worshipped the true God together <a id="l485"></a>with the Gods of the Gentiles. And this I told you was plain <a id="l486"></a>by the history of the  captivity registred in this chapter <a id="l487"></a>ffor – – –</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p015v"> &lt;15v&gt; </span>
<p id="par20">There is a place also in Ier (ch 44. v. 27) where certain <a id="l488"></a>of the Idolatrous Iews being fled from the taking of Ierusalem into <a id="l489"></a>Ægypt are reprehended for making  solemn vows to perform <a id="l490"></a>sacrifices to the Queen of heaven, &amp; threatned that since they <a id="l491"></a>did make such vows they should be suffered  no longer <a id="l492"></a>to swear  the Lord God liveth, but be utterly destroyed <a id="l493"></a>out of Egypt by the arms of Nebuchadnezzar. And by comparing this <a id="l494"></a>place with the former of Hosea one may easily learn that <a id="l495"></a> their vows by which they ingaged to perform sacrifices or other <a id="l496"></a>duties to their Idols &amp; fals Gods, used to be done in the name of the Lord <a id="l497"></a>God saying the Lord liveth. And no wonder therefore the Lord was <a id="l498"></a>so much offended at this oath as to reccon it among their greatest <a id="l499"></a>sins, though without doubt they thought they  <a id="l500"></a>honoured the Lord thereby.</p>
