<p id="par1" class="i0">Sir</p>
<p id="par2">Since the discourses of some late writers have raised in you a <a id="l3"></a>curiosity, of knowing the truth of that text of Scripture concerning <a id="l4"></a>the testimony of the three in heaven 1 Iohn 5.7: I have here sent <a id="l5"></a>you an account of what the reading has been in all ages, &amp; by <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>what<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l6"></a>steps it has been changed, so far as I can hitherto determine by <a id="l7"></a>records.  And I have done it the more freely because to you who <a id="l8"></a>understand the many abuses which they of the Roman Church have <a id="l9"></a>put upon the world, it will scarce be ungratefull to be convinced of one <a id="l10"></a>more than is commonly believed.  For althô the more learned &amp; <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>clear<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l11"></a>sighted men (as Luther, Erasmus, Bullinger Grotius &amp; some others) could not <a id="l12"></a>dissemble their knowledge, yet the generality are fond of the place <a id="l13"></a>for its making against heresy.   But whilst we ex<a id="l14"></a>claim against the pious frauds of the Roman Church, &amp; make <a id="l15"></a>it a part of our religion to detect  &amp; renounce all things of <a id="l16"></a>that kind: we must acknowledge it a greater crime in us to <a id="l17"></a>favour such practises, then in the Papists we so much blame <a id="l18"></a>on that account.  For they act according to their religion <a id="l19"></a>but we contrary to ours.  In the eastern nations, &amp; for a <a id="l20"></a>long time in the western the faith subsisted without this <a id="l21"></a>text &amp; it is rather a danger to religion then an advantage <a id="l22"></a>to make it now lean upon a bruised reed.  There cannot <a id="l23"></a>be better service done to the truth then to purge it of things <a id="l24"></a>spurious: &amp; therefore knowing your prudence &amp; calmnesse of <a id="l25"></a>temper, I am confident I shal not offend you by telling you <a id="l26"></a>my mind plainly: especially since 'tis no article of faith, no <a id="l27"></a>point of discipline, nothing but a criticism concerning a text <a id="l28"></a>of scripture which I am going to write about.</p>
<p id="par3">The history of the corruption in short is this.  First some of the <a id="l29"></a>Latines interpreted the spirit water &amp; blood of the Father, Son <a id="l30"></a>&amp; Holy ghost to prove them one.  Then Ierome for the same <a id="l31"></a>end inserted the Trinity in expres words into his Version. Out <a id="l32"></a>of him the Africans <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>began to allege<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> it against the Vandals <a id="l33"></a>about 64 years after his death.  Afterwards the Latines <a id="l34"></a>noted his variations in the margins of their books &amp; thence it began <a id="l35"></a>at length to creep into the text in transcribing, &amp; that chiefly <a id="l36"></a>in the twelft &amp; following Centuries when revived <a id="l37"></a>by the Schoolmen.  And when printing came it crept <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> out of the Latine into the printed Greek against the <a id="l38"></a>authority of all the greek MSS &amp; ancient Versions, <a id="l39"></a>&amp; from the Venetian presses it went soon after <a id="l40"></a>into Grece.  Now the truth of this history will <a id="l41"></a>appear by considering the arguments on both sides.</p>
<p id="par4">The arguments alleged for the testimony of <a id="l42"></a>the three in heaven are the authorities of Cy<a id="l43"></a>prian, Athanasius &amp; Ierome, &amp; of many <a id="l44"></a>greek manuscripts &amp; almost all the Latine ones.</p>
<p id="par5">Cyprians words run thus.  <sup>a.</sup><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> The Lord <a id="l45"></a><em class="underline">saith, I</em> and the Father am one, &amp; again <em class="underline">of the <a id="l46"></a>Father</em> &amp; Son &amp; Holy Ghost it is written.  <em class="underline">And <a id="l47"></a>these three are one</em>.  The Socinians here deale <a id="l48"></a>too injuriously with Cyprian while they would <a id="l49"></a>have this place corrupted: for Cyprian in <a id="l50"></a>another place repeats almost the same thing <a id="l51"></a><sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> <em class="underline">If</em>, saith he, [one baptized amongst hereticks] <em class="underline">be <a id="l52"></a>made the temple of God, tell me I pray of <a id="l53"></a>what God? . . . .  If of the Holy ghost, since these <a id="l54"></a>three are one, how can the Holy ghost be <a id="l55"></a>reconciled to him who is the enemy of either <a id="l56"></a>the Father or the Son</em>.  These places of Cyprian <a id="l57"></a>being in my opinion genuine seem so apposite <a id="l58"></a>to prove the testimony of the three in heaven, <a id="l59"></a>that I should never have suspected a mistake in <a id="l60"></a>it could I but have reconciled it with the igno<a id="l61"></a>rance I meet with of this reading in the next <a id="l62"></a>age amongst the Latines of both Afric &amp; Europe <a id="l63"></a>as well as amongst the Greeks.  For had it been <a id="l64"></a>in Cyprian's Bible, the Latines of the next age <a id="l65"></a>when all the world was engaged in disputing <a id="l66"></a>about the Trinity &amp; all arguments that could be <a id="l67"></a>thought of were diligently sought out &amp; daily <a id="l68"></a>brought upon the stage, could never have been <a id="l69"></a>ignorant of a text, which in our age now the dispute is <a id="l70"></a>over is chiefly insisted upon.  In reconciling this <a id="l71"></a>difficulty I consider therefore that the only words <a id="l72"></a>of the text quoted by Cyprian in both places <a id="l73"></a>are, And these three are one: which words may <a id="l74"></a>belong to the eighth verse as well as to the seventh.  <a id="l75"></a>ffor <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> Eucherius Bishop of Lion in France &amp; contempo<a id="l76"></a>rary to S. Austin, reading the text without the seventh verse tells <a id="l77"></a>us that many then understood the Spirit, the Water &amp; <a id="l78"></a>the Blood to signify the Trinity.  And <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> S. Austin <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r-b"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> is one of those many as you may see in his third book against <a id="l79"></a>Maximus, where he tells us that the Spirit is the Father, <a id="l80"></a>for God is a spirit, the water the Holy Ghost, for he is the wa<a id="l81"></a>ter which Christ gives to them that thirst, &amp; the blood the Son <a id="l82"></a>for the Word was made flesh.  Now if it was the opi<a id="l83"></a>nion of many in the western Churches of those times <a id="l84"></a>that the spirit, the water &amp; the blood signified the Fa<a id="l85"></a>ther, the Son, &amp; the Holy Ghost, its plain that the testi<a id="l86"></a>mony of the three in heaven in expresse words was <a id="l87"></a>not yet crept into their books, <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> even without this <a id="l88"></a>testimony it was obvious for Cyprian or any man <a id="l89"></a>else of that opinion to say of the Father &amp; Son <a id="l90"></a>&amp; Holy Ghost: it is written <em class="underline">And these three are one</em>.  <a id="l91"></a>And that this was Cyprian's meaning, <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> Facundus, an <a id="l92"></a>African Bishop in the sixt Century is my author.  <a id="l93"></a>For he tells us expresly that Cyprian in the <a id="l94"></a>above mentioned place understood it so, interpreting <a id="l95"></a>the water, spirit &amp; blood to be the Father, Son <a id="l96"></a>&amp; Holy Ghost &amp; thence affirming that Iohn said <a id="l97"></a>of the Father, Son &amp; Holy Ghost, <em class="underline">These three are <a id="l98"></a>one</em>.  This at least may be gathered from this <a id="l99"></a>passage of Facundus, that some in those early ages <a id="l100"></a>interpreted Cyprian after this manner.  Nor do I <a id="l101"></a>understand how any of those many who took the <a id="l102"></a>spirit water &amp; blood for a type of the Trinity, <a id="l103"></a>or any man else who was ignorant of the testi<a id="l104"></a>mony of the three in heaven (as the Churches in <a id="l105"></a>the times of the Arian controversy generally were) <a id="l106"></a>could understand him otherwise.  And even Cypri<a id="l107"></a>an's own words do plainly make for this interpre<a id="l108"></a>tation.  For he does not say, the Father, the Word <a id="l109"></a>&amp; the Holy Ghost as 'tis now in the seventh verse, <a id="l110"></a>but the Father &amp; Son &amp; Holy Ghost as 'tis in Baptism, <a id="l111"></a>the place from whence they used at first to derive <a id="l112"></a>the Trinity.  If it be pretended that the words <a id="l113"></a>cited by Cyprian are taken out of the seventh verse <a id="l114"></a>rather then out of the eighth because he reads <a id="l115"></a>not <em class="underline">Hi tres in unum sunt</em> but <em class="underline">hi tres unum sunt</em> <a id="l116"></a>I answer that the Latines  generally read <em class="underline">hi <a id="l117"></a>tres unum sunt</em> as well in the eighth verse <a id="l118"></a>as in the seventh as you may see in the newly cited <a id="l119"></a>places of S. Austin &amp; Facundus, &amp; those of Ambrose, <a id="l120"></a>Pope Leo, Beda &amp; Cassiodorus  which follow, &amp; <a id="l121"></a>in the present Vulgar Latine.  So then the tes<a id="l122"></a>timony of Cyprian respects the eighth, or at least <a id="l123"></a>is as applicable to that verse as to the seventh, <a id="l124"></a>&amp; therefore is of no force for proving the truth <a id="l125"></a>of the seventh: but on the contrary for disproving <a id="l126"></a>it we have here the testimonies of Facundus, S. Austin, <a id="l127"></a>Eucherius &amp; those many others whom Eucherius mentions.  <a id="l128"></a><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>For<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> if those of that age had met with it in their books they would <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> never have understood the spirit the water &amp; the blood to be the <a id="l129"></a>three persons of the Trinity in order to prove them <a id="l130"></a>one God.</p>
<p id="par6">And what is said of the testimony of Tertullian &amp; Cyprian may <a id="l131"></a>be much more said of that in the feigned disputation of Atha<a id="l132"></a>nasius with Arius at Nice.

But I should tell you also that that <a id="l157"></a>Disputation was not writ by Athanasius but by a later Author <a id="l158"></a>&amp; therefore as a spurious piece uses not to be insisted <a id="l159"></a>upon.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 5r resumes &gt; </span> And <a id="l160"></a>besides, this disputation was not writ by Athanasius but <a id="l161"></a>by a later Author, &amp; therfore as a spurious piece uses not to be much insisted upon.</p>
<p id="par7">Now this mystical application of the spirit water <a id="l162"></a>&amp; blood to signify the Trinity, seems to me to have given <a id="l163"></a>occasion to some body either fraudulently to insert the tes<a id="l164"></a>timony of the three in heaven in expresse words into the <a id="l165"></a>text for proving the Trinity, or else to note it in the margin of his book by <a id="l166"></a>way of interpretation, whence it might afterwards creep <a id="l167"></a>into the text in transcribing.  And the first upon record that <a id="l168"></a>inserted it is Ierome, if the <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> Preface to the Canonical Epistles <a id="l169"></a>which pass under his name are his.  For whilst he composed <a id="l170"></a>not a new Translation of the new Testament but only cor<a id="l171"></a>rected the ancient Vulgar Latine (as learned men think) <a id="l172"></a>&amp; amongst his emendations ( writen perhaps at first in the margin of <a id="l173"></a>his book) he inserted this testimony <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>and complains<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> in the said <a id="l174"></a>Preface how he was thereupon accused by some of the <a id="l175"></a>Latines for falsifying the scripture, &amp; makes answer that <a id="l176"></a>former Latine Translators had much erred from the <a id="l177"></a>faith in putting only the spirit water &amp; blood in their edi<a id="l178"></a>tion &amp; omitting the testimony of the three in heaven whereby <a id="l179"></a>the Catholick faith is established by this defense he seems <a id="l180"></a>to say that he corrected the vulgar latine Translation by the <a id="l181"></a>original Greek, &amp; this is the great testimony which the Text <a id="l182"></a>relies upon.</p>
<p id="par8">But whilst he confesses it was not in the Latine be<a id="l183"></a>fore, &amp; accuses former Translators of falsifying the scrip<a id="l184"></a>tures in omitting it, he satisfies us that it has crept into the <a id="l185"></a>Latine since his time, &amp; so cuts off all the authority of <a id="l186"></a>the present Vulgar Latine for justifying it.  And whilst <a id="l187"></a>he was accused by his contemporaries of falsifying the <a id="l188"></a>scriptures in inserting it, this accusation also confirms that <a id="l189"></a>he altered the public reading.  For had the reading been <a id="l190"></a>dubious before he made it so, no man would have <a id="l191"></a>charged him with falsification for following either <a id="l192"></a>part.  Also whilst upon this accusation he recommends <a id="l193"></a>the alteration by its usefulnesse for establishing the <a id="l194"></a>catholic faith, this renders it the more suspected by <a id="l195"></a>discovering both the designe of his making it, &amp; the ground <a id="l196"></a>of his hoping for successe.  However seing he was <a id="l197"></a>thus accused by his contemporaries, it gives us <a id="l198"></a>just occasion to examin the businesse between <a id="l199"></a>him &amp; his accusers.  And so he being <a id="l200"></a>called to the barr, we are not to lay <a id="l201"></a>stresse upon his own testimony for <a id="l202"></a>himself, (for no man is a witnesse in <a id="l203"></a>his own cause,) but laying aside all prejudice <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> we ought  according to the ordinary rules of justice to examin the busi<a id="l204"></a>nesse between him &amp; his accusers by other witnesses.</p>
<p id="par9">They that have been conversant in his writings observe <a id="l205"></a>a strange liberty he takes in asserting things.  Many notable <a id="l206"></a>instances of this he has left us in composing those very <a id="l207"></a>fabulous lives of Paul &amp; Hilarion, not to mention what <a id="l208"></a>he has written upon other occasions.   Whence Erasmus <a id="l209"></a>said of him that he was in affirming things <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> <em class="underline">frequently <a id="l210"></a>violent &amp; impudent &amp; often contrary to himself</em>.  But I accuse him not.  It's possible he might be sometimes <a id="l211"></a>imposed upon or through inadvertency commit a mistake.  <a id="l212"></a>Yet since his contemporaries accused him, it's just we <a id="l213"></a>should lay aside the prejudice of his great name &amp; <a id="l214"></a>hear the cause impartially between them</p>
<p id="par10">Now the witnesses between them are partly <a id="l215"></a>the ancient Translators of the scriptures into various <a id="l216"></a>languages, partly the writers of his own age &amp; of the <a id="l217"></a>ages next before &amp; after him &amp; partly the scribes <a id="l218"></a>who have copied out the greek Manuscripts of the <a id="l219"></a>scriptures in all ages.  And all three are against him.  <a id="l220"></a>For by the unanimous  evidence of all these, <a id="l221"></a>it will appear that the testimony of the three in <a id="l222"></a>heaven was wanting in the Greek Manuscripts from <a id="l223"></a>whence Ierome, or whoever was the author of that <a id="l224"></a>Preface to the Canonical Epistles, pretends to have <a id="l225"></a>borrowed it.</p>
<p id="par11">The ancient Interpreters which I cite as witnesses <a id="l226"></a>against him are chiefly the Authors of the ancient <a id="l227"></a>Vulgar Latin of the Syriac &amp; of the Ethiopic versi<a id="l228"></a>ons.  For as he tells us that the Latines omitted <a id="l229"></a>the testimony of the three in heaven in their <a id="l230"></a>version before his time, so in the Syriac &amp; Ethiopic <a id="l231"></a>Versions (both which by Walton's account of them are <a id="l232"></a>much ancienter then Ierome's time, being the Versions <a id="l233"></a>which the oriental &amp; Ethiopic nations received from <a id="l234"></a>the beginning &amp; generally used as the Latines did <a id="l235"></a>the vulgar Latine) that testimony is wanting to this <a id="l236"></a>day: &amp; the authors of these three most ancient <a id="l237"></a>most famous &amp; most received versions by omitting <a id="l238"></a>it are concurrent witnesses that they found it <a id="l239"></a>wanting in the original greek Manuscripts of their <a id="l240"></a>times.  Tis wanting also in other ancient versions, as <a id="l241"></a>in the Egyptian Arabic published  in Walton's  Polyglott, in <sup>k</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> the <a id="l242"></a>Armenian used ever since Chrysostom's age by the Arme<a id="l243"></a>nian nations &amp; in the Illyrican of Cyrillus used in Rascia, Bul<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span>garia Moldavia Ruscia Muscovy &amp; other countries <a id="l244"></a>which use the Sclavonick tongue.  In a <sup>l</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> copy of this <a id="l245"></a>version printed  at Ostrobe in  Volkinia  in the year 1581, I have <a id="l246"></a>seen it wanting, &amp; one <sup>m</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> Camillus relates the same <a id="l247"></a>thing out of ancient manuscripts of this Version seen <a id="l248"></a>by him. Father Simon <sup>n</sup><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> notes it wanting also in a certain Version of the French Church, which (saith he) is at least a thousand years old &amp; which was published by F. <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Mabillon<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> a Benedictine Monck. Nor do I know of any Version wherein <a id="l249"></a>it's extant except the modern vulgar Latin &amp; such <a id="l250"></a>modern versions of the western nations as have been <a id="l251"></a>influenced by it.  So then by the unanimous consent <a id="l252"></a>of all the ancient &amp; faithful Interpreters we have <a id="l253"></a>hitherto met with (who doubtless made use of the best <a id="l254"></a>Manuscripts they could get) the testimony of the three <a id="l255"></a>in heaven was not anciently in the Greek.</p>
<p id="par12">And that it was neither in the ancient Versions <a id="l256"></a>nor in the Greek but was wholy unknown to the first <a id="l257"></a>Churches is most certain by an argument hinted above, <a id="l258"></a>namely that in all that vehement universal &amp; lasting <a id="l259"></a>controversy about the Trinity in Ieromes time &amp; both <a id="l260"></a>before &amp; long enough after it: this text of the three <a id="l261"></a>in heaven was never thought of.  Tis now in every <a id="l262"></a>bodies mouth &amp; acccounted the main text for the business <a id="l263"></a>&amp; would have been so then had it been in their books <a id="l264"></a>&amp; yet it is not once to be met with in all the Dis<a id="l265"></a>putes, Epistles, Orations &amp; other writings of the Greeks <a id="l266"></a>&amp; Latines (Alexander of Alexandria, Athanasius the Council of Sardica, Basil, <a id="l267"></a>Nazianzen, Nyssen, Epiphanius, Chrysostom, Cyril, Theodoret, <a id="l268"></a>Hilary, Ambrose, Austin, Victorinus Afer, Philastrius Brixi<a id="l269"></a>ensis, Phæbadius Agennensis, Gregorius Bæticus, Faustinus <a id="l270"></a>Diaconus, Paschasius, Arnobius junior, Cerealis &amp; others) in the times of those con<a id="l271"></a>troversies; no not in Ierome himself if his version <a id="l272"></a>&amp; Preface to the Canonical epistles be excepted.  The <a id="l273"></a>writings of those times were very many &amp; copious <a id="l274"></a>&amp; there is no argument or text of scripture to this <a id="l275"></a>purpose which they do not urge again &amp; again.  <a id="l276"></a>That of Iohn's Gospel, <em class="underline">I &amp; the father am one</em> is <a id="l277"></a>every where inculcated but this of the three in <a id="l278"></a>heaven &amp; their being one is no where to be met <a id="l279"></a>with till at length when the ignorant ages came <a id="l280"></a>on it began by degrees to creep into the Latine <a id="l281"></a>copies out of Ierome's Version.  So far are they <a id="l282"></a>from citing the testimony of the three in heaven, <a id="l283"></a>that on the contrary as often as they have occasion <a id="l284"></a>to mention the place they omit it, &amp; that as well <a id="l285"></a>after Ierome's age as in &amp; before it.  For Hesychius <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> cites the place thus. <sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> <em class="underline">Audi Ioannem dicentem tria sunt qui <a id="l286"></a>testimonium præbent &amp; tres unum sunt, spiritus et sanguis et <a id="l287"></a>aqua</em>.  The words in terra he omits, which is never done <a id="l288"></a>but in copies where the testimony of the three in heaven <a id="l289"></a>is wanting.  Cassiodorus, or who ever was the author of the latin Version <a id="l290"></a>of the discourse of Clemens Alexandrinus on these Epistles <a id="l291"></a>of S<sup>t</sup> Iohn, reads it thus. <sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> <a id="l292"></a><em class="underline">Quia tres sunt qui testificantur spiritus et aqua et sanguis <a id="l293"></a>et hi tres unum sunt</em>.

Quoniam tres sunt qui testimonium <a id="l296"></a>dant in terra spiritus aqua et sanguis &amp; tres unum sunt.  <a id="l297"></a>Si testimonium. &amp;c</em>  But here the words <em class="underline">in terra</em> so far <a id="l298"></a>as I can gather by his commentary on this text have <a id="l299"></a>been inserted by some later hand.  The author of the <a id="l300"></a>first Epistle ascribed to Pope Eusebius reads it as <a id="l301"></a>Beda doth, omitting only the words <em class="underline">in terra</em>.  And if the <a id="l302"></a>authority of Popes be valuable, Pope Leo the great, in <a id="l303"></a>his tenth Epistle thus cites the place.  <em class="underline">Et spiritus est <a id="l304"></a>qui testificatur, quoniam spiritus est veritas.  Quia tres <a id="l305"></a>sunt qui testimonium dant, spiritus et aqua et sanguis <a id="l306"></a>et hi tres unum sunt</em>.  Ambrose in the sixt Chapter <a id="l307"></a>of his first book de spiritu sancto disputing for the <a id="l308"></a>unity of the three persons, saith, <em class="underline">Hi tres unum sunt <a id="l309"></a>Ioannes dixit, Aqua sanguis et spiritus.  Vnum in mysterio <a id="l310"></a>non in natura</em>.  This is all he could find of the text <a id="l311"></a>while he was disputing about the Trinity, &amp; therefore <a id="l312"></a>he proves the unity of the persons by the mystical <a id="l313"></a>unity of the spirit water &amp; blood, interpreting these <a id="l314"></a>of the Trinity with Cyprian &amp; others.  Yea in the 11<sup>th</sup> <a id="l315"></a>chapter of his third book, he fully recites the Text thus. <sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup><em class="underline">Per aquam et sanguinem venit Christus Iesus <a id="l316"></a>non solum in aqua sed in aqua et sanguine: et spiri<a id="l317"></a>tus testimonium quoniam spiritus est veritas.  Quia tres <a id="l318"></a>sunt testes spiritus aqua et sanguis, et hi tres unum <a id="l319"></a>sunt in Christo Iesu</em>.  The like readings of ffacundus, <a id="l320"></a>Eucherius &amp; S. Austin you have in the places cited <a id="l321"></a>above.  These are the Latines as late or later then <a id="l322"></a>Ierome.   ffor Ierome did not prevail with the <a id="l323"></a>Churches of his own times to receive the testimony of <a id="l324"></a>the three in heaven.  And for them to know his Version <a id="l325"></a>&amp; not receive this testimony was in effect to condemn <a id="l326"></a>it.</p>
<p id="par13">And as for the Greeks, Cyril of Alexandria reads <a id="l327"></a>the text without this testimony in the 14th book of his The<a id="l328"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span>saurus chap. 5, &amp; again in his first book de fide ad <a id="l329"></a>Reginas a little after the middle.  And so doth Oecu<a id="l330"></a>menius a later Greek in his commentary on this <a id="l331"></a>place of S. Iohn's Epistle.  Also Didymus Alexan<a id="l332"></a>drinus in his commentary on the same place reads <a id="l333"></a>the spirit water &amp; blood without mentioning the <a id="l334"></a>three in heaven, &amp; so he doth in his book of the <a id="l335"></a>Holy Ghost where he seems to omit nothing that <a id="l336"></a>he could find for his purpose: &amp; so doth Gregory <a id="l337"></a>Nazianzen in his 37<sup>th</sup> Oration concerning the Holy <a id="l338"></a>Ghost, &amp; also Nicetas in his Commentary on Gregory <a id="l339"></a>Nazianzen's 44<sup>th</sup> Oration.  And here it is further observable that the Eusebians contended <a id="l340"></a>that the Father Son &amp; Holy Ghost were not to <a id="l341"></a>be connumerated because things of a different kind, &amp; <a id="l342"></a>Nazianzen &amp; Nicetas answer that they might be <a id="l343"></a>connumerated because S<sup>t</sup> Iohn connumerates three <a id="l344"></a>things not consubstantial, the spirit the water &amp; <a id="l345"></a>the blood.  By the objection of the Eusebians it <a id="l346"></a>appears that the testimony of the three in hea<a id="l347"></a>ven was not in their books, &amp; by the answer <a id="l348"></a>of the Catholicks it is as evident that it was <a id="l349"></a>not in theirs.  ffor while they answer by instancing <a id="l350"></a>in the spirit water &amp; blood they could not have <a id="l351"></a>missed of the ffather Word &amp; Holy Ghost had they <a id="l352"></a>been connumerated &amp; called one in the words imme<a id="l353"></a>diately before; &amp; to answer by instancing in these <a id="l354"></a>would have been far more to the purpose because <a id="l355"></a>the very thing in question.  In like manner the <a id="l356"></a>Eunomians in disputing against the Catholicks <a id="l357"></a>objected that the Holy Ghost is no where in <a id="l358"></a>scripture conjoyned with the ffather &amp; <em class="underline">Son</em>  <a id="l359"></a>except in baptism, which is as much as to say <a id="l360"></a>that the testimony of the three in heaven <a id="l361"></a>was not in their books: &amp; S. Basil<sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup> whilst he is <a id="l362"></a>very diligent in returning an answer to them, <a id="l363"></a>&amp; perplexes himself in citing places which are nothing <a id="l364"></a>to the purpose, does not produce this text of the <a id="l365"></a>three in heaven, thô the most obvious &amp;  only proper <a id="l366"></a>place had it been then in the scriptures, &amp; therefore he <a id="l367"></a>knew nothing of it.  The Objection of the Eunomians <a id="l368"></a>&amp; answer of the Catholicks sufficiently shews that it was <a id="l369"></a>in the books of neither party.  Besides all this, the 10<sup>th</sup> Epistle *<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 8v &gt; </span> * Insert this at the bottom of the next page. epistle  * of Pope Leo mentioned above, was that very famous Epistle <a id="l370"></a>to Flavian Patriarch of Constantinople against Eutyches, which <a id="l371"></a>went about through all the Churches both Eastern &amp; western, <a id="l372"></a>being translated into Greek &amp; sent about in the East by Flavian.  It was <a id="l373"></a>generally applauded in the West, &amp; read in the Councel of <a id="l374"></a>Chalcedon, &amp; there solemnly approved &amp; subscribed by all the <a id="l375"></a>Bishops.  And in this Epistle the text was thus cited.  <em class="underline">Et <a id="l376"></a>spiritus est qui testificatur quoniam Christus est veritas: Quia <a id="l377"></a>tres sunt qui  testimonium dant, spiritus et aqua <a id="l378"></a>et sanguis et hi tres unum sunt</em>.    And by putting πνευμα (accord<a id="l379"></a>ing to the greek reading) for <em class="underline">Christus</em> which is still the vul<a id="l380"></a>gar Latine, it was thus translated by the Greeks.  
Καὶ τὸ πνευμά ἐστιν τὸ <a id="l381"></a>μαρτυρουν ἐπειδὴ τὸ πνευμά ἐστιν ἡ ἀλήθεια.

So then we have this reading <a id="l384"></a>quoted by the Pope, owned in the West &amp;  solemnly <a id="l385"></a>subscribed in the East by the fourth general Council.  <a id="l386"></a> &amp; therefore it continued the public received reading in both <a id="l387"></a>east &amp; west till after the age of that Council.</p>

<p id="par15">So then the testimony of the three in heaven, which in the <a id="l388"></a>times of those controversies would have been in every bodies <a id="l389"></a>mouth had it been in their books,  was wholy unknown to <a id="l390"></a>the Churches of those ages.

Well then it was out of their books in Ierom's <a id="l409"></a>age when he pretends it was in which is the point we were to prove; &amp; when any body can <a id="l410"></a>shew that it was in before, it may be pertinent to <a id="l411"></a>consider that point also: but till then we are only to enquire <a id="l412"></a>how since it was out, it came into the copies now extant.  <a id="l413"></a>For they that without proof accuse hereticks of corrupting books, &amp; upon <a id="l414"></a>that pretense correct them at their pleasure without the authority <a id="l415"></a>of ancient manuscripts, (as some learned men in the fourth &amp; fift <a id="l416"></a>Centuries used to do,) are ffalsaries by their own confession, &amp; need <a id="l417"></a>no other confutation.  And therefore if this reading was once out, <a id="l418"></a>we are bound in justice to beleive it was out from the beginning, <a id="l419"></a>unlesse the rasing of it out can be proved by some better ar<a id="l420"></a>gument then that of pretense &amp; clamour.</p>
<p id="par16">Will you now say that Ierome followed some Copy <a id="l421"></a>different from what the Greeks were acquainted with?  This is to over<a id="l422"></a>throw the authority of his Version by making him depart from the <a id="l423"></a>received Greek: &amp; besides it is contrary to what he himself <a id="l424"></a>seems to represent.  ffor in blaming, not the vulgar greek copies, but <a id="l425"></a>the Latine Interpreters which were before him as if they had varied <a id="l426"></a>from the received Greek,  he represents that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span> he followed it.  He does not excuse &amp; justify himself for receding <a id="l427"></a>from the received Greek to follow a private copy, but accuses <a id="l428"></a>former Interpreters as if in leaving out the testimony of <a id="l429"></a>the three in heaven they had not followed the received Greek as he did.  <a id="l430"></a>And therefore since the Greeks knew nothing of this testi<a id="l431"></a>mony, the authority of his Version sinks: &amp; that the rather <a id="l432"></a>because he was then accused of corrupting the text &amp; <a id="l433"></a>could not perswade either the Greeks or Latines of <a id="l434"></a>those times to receive his reading.  For the Latines <a id="l435"></a>received it not till many years after his death, &amp; the Greeks <a id="l436"></a>not till this present age when the Venetians sent it <a id="l437"></a>amongst them in printed books: &amp; their not receiving it was <a id="l438"></a>to approve the accusation.</p>
<p id="par17">The authority of this Version being thus far <a id="l439"></a>discust, it remains that we consider the authority <a id="l440"></a>of the Manuscripts wherein we now read the testimony <a id="l441"></a>of the three in heaven.  And by the best enquiry that <a id="l442"></a>I have been able to make it is wanting in the ma<a id="l443"></a>nuscripts of all Languages but the Latine.  ffor as we <a id="l444"></a>have shewed that the Ethiopic, Syriac, Arabic, Armenian <a id="l445"></a>&amp; Sclavonian Versions still in use in the several <a id="l446"></a>eastern nations Ethiopia, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, <a id="l447"></a>Armenia, Moscovy &amp; some others are strangers to this <a id="l448"></a>reading &amp; that it was anciently wanting also in the French : so I am told by those who have been in Turkey <a id="l449"></a>that it is wanting to this day in the Greek manuscripts of <a id="l450"></a>those parts as well as in the manuscripts which have been brought <a id="l451"></a>from thence into the west; &amp; that the Greeks now they have got it <a id="l452"></a>in print from the Venetians, when their manuscripts are objected <a id="l453"></a>against it, pretend that the Arians rased it out.  <a id="l454"></a>A reading to be found in no manuscripts but the Latine, &amp; not in <a id="l455"></a>the Latine before Ierome's age as Ierome himself confesses, can be <a id="l456"></a>but of little authority, &amp; this authority  sinks because we have already proved the reading spurious by <a id="l457"></a>shewing that it was heretofore unknown both to the western &amp; <a id="l458"></a>eastern churches in the times of the great controversies about the <a id="l459"></a>Trinity.  But however for further satisfaction we shall now give <a id="l460"></a>you an account of the Latin &amp; Greek manuscripts, &amp; shew first how in the dark ages it crept <a id="l461"></a>into the Latine manuscripts  out of Ierome's Version <a id="l462"></a>&amp; then how it lately crept out of the Latine into the printed <a id="l463"></a>Greek without the authority of  MSS.: those who first published it in Greek having never yet so much <a id="l464"></a>as seen it in any Greek manuscript.</p>
<p id="par18">That the Vulgar Latin now in use is mixed of the old Vulgar <a id="l465"></a>Latine &amp; of Ierome's Version together is the received opinion.  Few <a id="l466"></a>of these Manuscripts are above 400 or 500 years old.  The latest generally <a id="l467"></a>have the testimony of the three in heaven; the oldest of all usually want <a id="l468"></a>it: which shews that it has crept in by degrees.  Erasmus notes it wanting <a id="l469"></a>in three very ancient ones, one of which was in the Popes Library at Rome, <a id="l470"></a>the other two at Bruges, &amp; adds that in another MS belonging to the bishop of the <a id="l471"></a>Minorites in Antwerp the testimony of the three in heaven was <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>noted<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> in the margin in <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>a newer<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span> hand.  Peter Cholinus notes in the margin of his Latine Edition of the <a id="l472"></a>scriptures printed A.C. 1543 &amp; 1544 that it was wanting in the most <a id="l473"></a>ancient manuscript of the Tigurine Library.  D<sup>r</sup> Burnet has lately <a id="l474"></a>in the first Letter of his Travells noted it wanting in five other ancient ones kept at <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>one<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 2 words)">{illeg}</span> about a 1000 years <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>old<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; the other four about 800.

An ancient &amp; dili<a id="l475"></a>gent collator of manuscripts cited by Lucas Brugensis by the name <a id="l476"></a>of Epanorthotes notes in general that it was wanting in the <a id="l477"></a>ancient latine manuscripts.  Lucas himself collating many Latine <a id="l478"></a>ones notes it wanting in only five, that is in the few old ones <a id="l479"></a>he had, his manuscripts being almost all of them new ones.  <a id="l480"></a><sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup>ffor he praises the Codex Lobiensis written A.C. 1084 &amp; the <a id="l481"></a>Codex Tornacensis written A.C. 1105, as most ancient &amp; vene<a id="l482"></a>rable for  antiquity, &amp; used others much more new, of which <a id="l483"></a>a great number was easily had, such as was the Codex  <a id="l484"></a>Buslidianus written A.C. 1432, that is but eight years <a id="l485"></a>before the invention of printing.

<p id="par19">But to go to the original of the corruption, <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup> Gregory the great <a id="l504"></a>writes that Ierome's version was in use in his time, &amp; there<a id="l505"></a>fore no wonder if the testimony of the three in heaven began to be <a id="l506"></a>cited out of it before.  Eugenius Bishop of Carthage in the seventh year <a id="l507"></a>of Hunneric King of the Vandals A.C. 484, in the summary of <a id="l508"></a>his faith exhibited to that King, cited it the first of any <a id="l509"></a>man so far as I can find.  A while after ffulgentius, another <a id="l510"></a>African Bishop disputing against the same Vandals cited it again, &amp; backt <a id="l511"></a>it with the forementioned place of Cyprian applied to the testimony of <a id="l512"></a>the three in heaven.  And so its probable that by that abused <a id="l513"></a>authority of Cyprian it began first in Afric in the disputes with <a id="l514"></a>the ignorant Vandals to get some credit, &amp; thence at length <a id="l515"></a>crept into Europe.  It occurs also frequently in Vigilius Tapsen<a id="l516"></a>sis another African Bishop contemporary to Fulgentius.  In its <a id="l517"></a>defense some allege earlier writers, namely the first Epistle <a id="l518"></a>of Pope Hyginus, the first Epistle of Pope Iohn II, the book <a id="l519"></a>of Idacius Clarus against Varimadus &amp; the book de unita Dei<a id="l520"></a>tate Trinitatis ascribed to Athanasius.  But Chiffletius who pub<a id="l521"></a>lished the works of Victor Vitensis &amp; Vigilius Tapsensis, sufficiently proves the book against <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013r"> &lt;13r&gt; </span> Varimadus to be this Vigilius's &amp; erroneously ascribed to Idacius.  To the same <a id="l522"></a>Vigilius he asserts also the book de unita Deitate Trinitatis.  Certainly Atha<a id="l523"></a>nasius was not its Author.  All the Epistle of Hyginus except the begin<a id="l524"></a>ning &amp; end, &amp; the first part of the Epistle of Pope Iohn wherein the <a id="l525"></a>testimony of the three in heaven is cited, are nothing else then frag<a id="l526"></a>ments of the book against Varimadus described word for word by some <a id="l527"></a>forger of Decretal Epistles, as may appear by comparing them.  <a id="l528"></a>So then Eugenius is the first upon record that quotes it.</p>
<p id="par20">But thô he set it on foot among the Africans, yet I cannot <a id="l529"></a>find that it  became of authority in Europe <a id="l530"></a>before the revival of learning in the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> Centuries.  <a id="l531"></a>In those ages S. Bernard, the Schoolmen, Ioachim &amp; the Lateran <a id="l532"></a>Council  spread it abroad &amp; Scribes began generally to <a id="l533"></a>insert it into the text: but in such Latine manuscripts &amp; <a id="l534"></a>European writers as are ancienter then those times, it is <a id="l535"></a>seldome to be met with.</p>
<p id="par21">Now that it was inserted into the Vulgar Latin out of Ierom's <a id="l536"></a>Version is manifest by the manner how the Vulgar Latin &amp; that <a id="l537"></a>Version came to be mixed.  For 'tis agreed that the Latines, after <a id="l538"></a>Ierome's Version began to be in use, noted out of it his  corrections of the Vulgar Latine in the Margins of their <a id="l540"></a>books &amp; these the transcribers afterwards inserted into the text.  <a id="l541"></a>By this means the old Latine has been so generally corrected that <a id="l542"></a>it is no where to be found sincere.  Tis Ierome that we now <a id="l543"></a>read &amp; not the old Vulgar Latine, &amp; what wonder if in Ierome <a id="l544"></a>we read the testimony of the three in heaven?  For who that <a id="l545"></a>inserted the rest of Ierome into the text would leave out such a <a id="l546"></a>passage for the Trinity as this has been taken to be?</p>
<p id="par22">But to put the question out of dispute there are footsteps <a id="l547"></a>of the insertion still remaining.  For in some old Manuscripts <a id="l548"></a>it has been found noted in the margin, in others the various read<a id="l549"></a>ings are such as ought to arise by transcribing it out of the <a id="l550"></a>margin into the text.  I shall only mention the three follow<a id="l551"></a>ing varieties.  Of the MSS which have not the testimony of <a id="l552"></a>the three in heaven some have the words in terra in the eighth verse but the most want it.  Which seems <a id="l553"></a>to proceed from hence that some before they allowed <a id="l554"></a>so great an addition to the text as the testimony of the three <a id="l555"></a>in heaven, noted only <em class="underline">in terra</em> in the margins of their <a id="l556"></a>books to be inserted into the testimony of the spirit, water &amp; blood.  Of the MSS which have the testimony of the three in <a id="l557"></a>heaven some in the eighth verse have <em class="underline">hi tres unum sunt</em> <a id="l558"></a>others not.  The reason of which seems to be that of those <a id="l559"></a>who noted this testimony in the margin, some blotted out <a id="l560"></a>et hi tres unum sunt in the eighth verse according to Ierome <a id="l561"></a>&amp; others did not.  And lastly the testimony of the three in <a id="l562"></a>heaven is in most books set before the testimony of the <a id="l563"></a>three in earth, in some set after.  So Erasmus notes <a id="l564"></a>two old books in which it is set after, Lucas Brugensis <a id="l565"></a>a third &amp; Hesselius (if I misremember not) a fourth: &amp; so Vigilius Tapsensis lib. adv. Varimadum c. 5, sets it after.  <a id="l566"></a>Which seems to proceed from hence that it was sometimes <a id="l567"></a>so noted in the margin that the Reader or transcriber knew not <a id="l568"></a>whether it were to come before or after.  Now these <a id="l569"></a>discords in the Latine manuscripts as they detract from the <a id="l570"></a>authority of the manuscripts, so they confirm to us that the old <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> vulgar latin has in these things been tampered with, <a id="l571"></a>&amp; corrected by Ieromes version.</p>
<p id="par23">In the next place I am to shew how &amp; when <a id="l572"></a>the testimony of the three in heaven crept out of <a id="l573"></a>the Latine into the Greek.  Those who first printed <a id="l574"></a>the greek Testament did generally in following their <a id="l575"></a>manuscripts omit the testimony of the three in heaven <a id="l576"></a>except in Spain.  For it was omitted in the first &amp; <a id="l577"></a>second editions of Erasmus A.C. 1516, &amp; 1519; in the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> Edition <a id="l578"></a>of ffrancis Asulan printed at Venice by Aldus A.C. 1518; <a id="l579"></a>in that of Nich. Gerbelius printed at Haganau  1521, &amp; a little after in that of Wolfius <a id="l581"></a>Cephalius printed at Strasburge A.C. 1524, &amp; again 1526; <a id="l582"></a>in  the Badian edition, as Erasmus notes, &amp; in that of Simon Cho<a id="l583"></a>linæus at Paris A.C. 1534.  At the same time it was <a id="l584"></a>omitted in some  editions of other western langua<a id="l585"></a>ges as in the Saxon &amp; German editions of Luther &amp; <a id="l586"></a>the Latine Tigurine editions of Peter Cholins A.C. 1543 <a id="l587"></a>&amp; 1544.  The first edition in greek which has the testimo<a id="l588"></a>ny of the three in heaven was that of Cardinal Xime<a id="l589"></a>nes printed at Complutum in Spain A.C. 1515, but not <a id="l590"></a>published before the year 1521.  The Cardinal in his <a id="l591"></a>edition used the assistance of several Divines which he <a id="l592"></a>called together to Complutum, there founding an Vni<a id="l593"></a>versity A.C. 1517, or a little before.  Two of those <a id="l594"></a>Divines were Antonius Nebrissensis &amp; Stunica.  For <a id="l595"></a>Stunica then resided at Complutum, &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> in the Preface <a id="l596"></a>to a treatise he wrote against Erasmus gives this testi<a id="l597"></a>mony of himself, that he had spent some years in <a id="l598"></a>reading the holy scriptures in Hebrew Greek &amp; Latin <a id="l599"></a>&amp; had diligently collated the Hebrew &amp; Greek exemplars <a id="l600"></a>with the Latine copies.  This book displeasing the Cardi<a id="l601"></a>nal was not printed till after his death, &amp; then it <a id="l602"></a>came forth at Complutum, A.C. 1521.  The year before <a id="l603"></a>one Lee an Englishman writ also against Erasmus, &amp; <a id="l604"></a>both  Stunica &amp; Lee amongst other things reprehend<a id="l605"></a>ed him for omitting the testimony of the three in <a id="l606"></a>heaven.  Afterwards Erasmus finding the Spaniards &amp; some <a id="l607"></a>others of the Roman Church in a heat against him <a id="l608"></a>printed this testimony in his third edition A.C. 1522, <a id="l609"></a>representing that in his former editions he had printed <a id="l610"></a>the text as he found it in his Manuscripts, but <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>now<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l611"></a>there being found in England one Manuscript which had <a id="l612"></a>the testimony of the three in heaven, he had inserted <a id="l613"></a>it according to that manuscript for avoiding the calumnies <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015r"> &lt;15r&gt; </span> raised against him.  And so it continued in his two following <a id="l614"></a>editions: And at length Robert Stephens A.C. 1550 reprinted <a id="l615"></a>Erasmus's edition with some few alterations &amp; various <a id="l616"></a>lections taken out of the Complutensian edition &amp; 15 greek Ma<a id="l617"></a>nuscripts which he named after the numeral letters <span class="greek">α</span>, <a id="l618"></a><span class="greek">β, γ, δ, ε</span> &amp;c putting <span class="greek">α</span> for the Complutensian edition &amp; <a id="l619"></a><span class="greek">β, γ, δ, ε</span> &amp;c for the Manuscripts in order &amp; noting <a id="l620"></a>in the margin that the testimony of the three in <a id="l621"></a>heaven was wanting in the seven Manuscripts <span class="greek">δ, ε, ζ, θ</span>, <a id="l622"></a><span class="greek">ι, ια, ιγ</span>.  Whence Beza<sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup> tells us that he had read it <a id="l623"></a>in the rest.  His words are: <em class="underline">Legit Hieronymus, legit <a id="l624"></a>Erasmus in Britannico codice et in Complutensi editione.  <a id="l625"></a>Legimus et nos in nonnullis Roberti nostri veteribus <a id="l626"></a>libris</em>.  And this is the original &amp; authority of the printed <a id="l627"></a>editions.  For these are  the editions ever since followed <a id="l628"></a>by all the West &amp; of late years propagated by the Venetian Presses into Grece: &amp; nothing further that I know of <a id="l629"></a>has been discovered in any manuscript in favour of these <a id="l630"></a>editions.</p>
<p id="par24"><sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup> Now to pull off the vizzard, I cannot but in the <a id="l631"></a>first place extreamly complain of Beza's want of <a id="l632"></a>modesty &amp; caution in expressing himself.  In the Preface <a id="l633"></a>to his annotations describing what helps he had in <a id="l634"></a>composing his first edition, he tells us that he had the <a id="l635"></a>Annotations of Valla, Stapulensis &amp; Erasmus, &amp; the writ<a id="l636"></a>ings of the ancients &amp; moderns collated by himself, <a id="l637"></a>&amp; out of Stephen's library the exemplar which Stephens <a id="l638"></a>had collated with about 25 manuscripts almost all of <a id="l639"></a> which were printed.  He should have said 17: for <a id="l640"></a>that number he puts in other places &amp; in his An<a id="l641"></a>notations cites no more.  So then he had the collati<a id="l642"></a>ons of two more Manuscripts then Stephens has <a id="l643"></a>given us in print.  And this was all his furniture.  <a id="l644"></a>The original manuscripts he does not here pretend <a id="l645"></a>to have, nor could he have them.  ffor they were <a id="l646"></a>not Stephen's manuscripts but belonged to several <a id="l647"></a>Libraries in France &amp; Italy.  The Manuscript <span class="greek">β</span> <a id="l648"></a>Stephens himself never saw but had only various <a id="l649"></a>lections collected out of it by his friends in Italy.  The <a id="l650"></a>manuscripts <span class="greek">γ, δ, ε, στ, ζ, η, ι, ιε</span> were not Stephens's <a id="l651"></a>but belonged to the Library of the King of France <a id="l652"></a>to whom Stephens was Printer.  The other six books <a id="l653"></a><span class="greek">θ, ια, ιβ, ιγ, ιδ, ιστ</span> Stephens had not out of his own <a id="l654"></a>Library but borrowed them for a time from several <a id="l655"></a>places to collate, his friends studying to furnish the <a id="l656"></a>designe of his edition.  And yet Beza in his Annotations <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span> when he would favour any Text takes the collations of <a id="l657"></a>Stephens in such a manner as if he had the very origi<a id="l658"></a>nal manuscripts at Geneva before his eyes.  And were <a id="l659"></a>Stephens does not cite various lections there he reccons <a id="l660"></a>that in the text of Stephens collated book he  read <a id="l661"></a>all the Manuscripts.  So in Marc. 6.11 when Stephens <a id="l662"></a>notes a certain period to be wanting in the manuscript <a id="l663"></a>copies <span class="greek">β</span> and <span class="greek">η</span> Beza saith, <em class="underline">Hæc periodus in omnibus <a id="l664"></a>exemplaribus græcis legitur exceptis secundo et octavo</em>  <a id="l665"></a>In Act. 13.33 because Stephens had noted no various <a id="l666"></a>lection Beza affirms of the greek text, <em class="underline">Ita scriptum <a id="l667"></a>invenimus in omnibus vetustis codicibus.</em>  In 1 Iohn. 4.3. <a id="l668"></a>where Stephens is silent Beza speaks: <em class="underline">sic legitur <a id="l669"></a>in omnibus Græcis exemplaribus, quæ quidem mihi inspi<a id="l670"></a>cere licuit</em>.  In Iames 1.2 where Stephens is again <a id="l671"></a>silent Beza tells us of the word μόνον <em class="underline">Ego in omnibus <a id="l672"></a>nostris vetustis libris inveni</em>.  And so where Stephens <a id="l673"></a>in the margin had noted the testimony of the three in hea<a id="l674"></a>ven to be wanting in seven manuscripts he thinks that <a id="l675"></a>in reading the  text of Stephens's collated book he <a id="l676"></a>reads it in  the rest &amp; so tells us.  <em class="underline">Legimus et nos <a id="l677"></a>in nonnullis Roberti Stephani codicibus</em>.  Thus he did in <a id="l678"></a>the first edition of his Annotations.  Afterwards when <a id="l679"></a>he had got two real manuscripts, the Claromontan &amp; <a id="l680"></a>that which at length he presented to the Vniversity <a id="l681"></a>of Cambridge, (in both which the Canonical Epistles are wanting) in the epistle to his fourth edition in <a id="l682"></a>recconing up the books he then used, he puts only <a id="l683"></a>these two &amp; the 17 of Stephens, &amp; in his fift <a id="l684"></a>edition he writes summarily that he used nineteen <a id="l685"></a>manuscripts, joyning with those two real ones the <a id="l686"></a>collations of Stephens as if in those he had 17 <a id="l687"></a>others: which sufficiently explains his way of speak<a id="l688"></a>ing in his Annotations.  But whilst he had not the <a id="l689"></a>manuscripts themselves to read with his own eyes, it <a id="l690"></a>was too hard &amp; unwarrantable a way of speaking <a id="l691"></a>to tell us, <em class="underline">Legimus et nos in nonnullis Roberti <a id="l692"></a> Stephani codicibus</em> &amp; therefore in his later editions <a id="l693"></a>he corrects himself &amp; tells us only that the read<a id="l694"></a>ing doth <em class="underline">extare in nonnullis Stephani veteribus <a id="l695"></a>libris</em>.  Thus Beza argues from Stephens book of <a id="l696"></a>collations: And the same inference has been made <a id="l697"></a>by Lucas Brugensis &amp; others ever since  from Stephens's forementioned <a id="l698"></a>edition of that book.  ffor say they Stephens' had <a id="l699"></a> fifteen manuscripts in all &amp; found the testimony <a id="l700"></a>of the three in heaven wanting but in seven, &amp; <a id="l701"></a>therefore it was in the other eight, &amp; so being <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017r"> &lt;17r&gt; </span> found in the greater part of his manuscripts has <a id="l702"></a>the authority of manuscripts on its side.  Thus they argue <a id="l703"></a>&amp; this is the great argument by which the printed  <a id="l704"></a>Greek has hitherto been justified.</p>
<p id="par25">But if they please to consider the business <a id="l705"></a>a little better they will find themselves very much <a id="l706"></a>mistaken.  ffor thô Stephens had fifteen manuscripts <a id="l707"></a>in all, yet all of them did not contein all the Greek <a id="l708"></a>Testament.  Four of them noted <span class="greek">γ, στ, ιβ, ιδ</span> had each <a id="l709"></a>of them the four Gospels only.  Two noted <span class="greek">β, η</span> conteined <a id="l710"></a>only the Gospels &amp; Acts of the Apostles.  One noted <span class="greek">ιστ</span> <a id="l711"></a>conteined the Apocalyps only.  One noted <span class="greek">ιε</span> had only the <a id="l712"></a>Apocalyps with S<sup>t</sup> Pauls epistles to the Corinthians <a id="l713"></a>Galathians Ephesians Philippians &amp; Colossians.  The <a id="l714"></a>other seven noted <span class="greek">δ, ε, ζ, θ, ι, ια, ιγ</span> conteined both <a id="l715"></a>S<sup>t</sup> Pauls Epistles &amp; the Canonical ones besides some <a id="l716"></a>other books: namely the Manuscript <span class="greek">ζ</span> conteined the <a id="l717"></a>Epistles &amp; Gospels, the manuscript <span class="greek">ι, ια ιγ</span> the Epistles <a id="l718"></a>&amp; Acts of the Apostles &amp; the manuscripts <span class="greek">δ, ε, θ</span> the <a id="l719"></a>Epistles Gospels &amp; Acts.  And this any one may gather <a id="l720"></a>by noting what manuscripts the various lections are <a id="l721"></a>cited out of in every book of the new Testament.  <a id="l722"></a>ffor in the various lections of the canonical Epistles <a id="l723"></a>&amp; those to the Thessalonians Timothy Titus &amp; the <a id="l724"></a>Hebrews are found these seven manuscripts, <span class="greek">δ, ε, ζ</span>, <a id="l725"></a><span class="greek">θ, ι, ια, ιγ</span> every where cited, &amp; no more then these.  <a id="l726"></a>The same also &amp; no more are cited in the Epistles <a id="l727"></a>to the Thessalonians Timothy Titus &amp; the Hebrews, <a id="l728"></a>one numeral error (whether of the scribe or <a id="l729"></a>Typographer) excepted.  Stephens therefore did collect <a id="l730"></a>various Lections of the Epistles out of only these <a id="l731"></a>seven manuscripts <span class="greek">δ, ε, ζ, θ, ι, ια ιγ</span> &amp; in all these <a id="l732"></a>seven he found the testimony of the three in heaven <a id="l733"></a>to be wanting as you may see noted in the margin <a id="l734"></a>of his edition.</p>
<p id="par26">And that this testimony was wanting ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 15v &gt; </span> ✝ And that this testimony was wanting in all Stephen's Manuscripts <a id="l735"></a>is apparent also by its being generally wanting in the MSS which <a id="l736"></a>are now extant in France.  For Father Simon <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup> tells us that <a id="l737"></a>after diligent search in the Library of the King of France <a id="l738"></a>&amp; in that also of Monsieur Colbert, he could not find it <a id="l739"></a>in any one  manuscript tho he consulted seven MSS in <a id="l740"></a>the Kings Library &amp; one in Colbert's.  And because Stephen <a id="l741"></a>had some of his various lections from Italy I will add <a id="l742"></a>that a Gentleman who in his travells had consulted twelve <a id="l743"></a>MSS in several Libraries in Italy, assured me that he <a id="l744"></a>found it wanting in them all.  One of the twelve was  that  <a id="l745"></a>most ancient &amp; most famous MS in the Popes library written in Capital letters.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 17r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par27">So then the authority of the printed books rests <a id="l746"></a>only upon the authority of the editions of Erasmus &amp; <a id="l747"></a>Cardinal Ximenes.  But seing Erasmus omitted it in <a id="l748"></a>his two first editions &amp; inserted it unwillingly against <a id="l749"></a>the authority of his manuscripts in his three last, the <a id="l750"></a>authority of these three can be none at all.  When <a id="l751"></a>Lee upon Erasmus's putting forth his second edition fell <a id="l752"></a>foule upon him for leaving out the testimony of the <a id="l753"></a>three in heaven, <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n26-ref">[26]</sup> Erasmus answered that he had consulted <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span> more then seven Greek Manuscripts &amp; found it wanting <a id="l754"></a>in them all, &amp; that if he could have found it but <a id="l755"></a>in any one manuscript he would have followed that in <a id="l756"></a>favour of the Latine.  Hence notice was sent to Eras<a id="l757"></a>mus out of England that it was in a manuscript there; <a id="l758"></a>&amp; thereupon  <a id="l759"></a><sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n27-ref">[27]</sup> to avoyd their calumnies (as he saith,) he printed it <a id="l760"></a>in his following editions notwithstanding that he suspected <a id="l761"></a>that manuscript to be a new one corrected by the latine.  <a id="l762"></a>But since upon enquiry <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n28-ref">[28]</sup> I cannot learn that they in <a id="l763"></a>England ever heard of any such manuscript but from <a id="l764"></a>Erasmus, &amp; since he was only told of such a manuscript <a id="l765"></a>in the time of the controversy between him &amp; Lee <a id="l766"></a>&amp; never saw it himself: I cannot forbear to suspect <a id="l767"></a>that it was nothing but a trick put upon him by some <a id="l768"></a>of the Popish Clergy, to try if he would make good <a id="l769"></a>what he had offered of printing the testimony of the <a id="l770"></a>three in heaven by the authority of any one greek <a id="l771"></a>copy, &amp; thereby to get it into his edition.  Greek <a id="l772"></a>manuscripts of the scriptures are things of value &amp; do <a id="l773"></a>not use to be thrown away, &amp; such a manuscript for <a id="l774"></a>the testimony of the three in heaven would have made <a id="l775"></a>a greater noise then the rest have done against it.  Let <a id="l776"></a>those who have such a manuscript at length tell us <a id="l777"></a>where it is.</p>
<p id="par28">So also let them who insist upon the edition of <a id="l778"></a>Cardinal Ximenes tell us by what Manuscript he <a id="l779"></a>printed this testimony, or at least where any such <a id="l780"></a>manuscript of good note is to be seen.  ffor till then <a id="l781"></a>I must take the liberty to beleive that he printed <a id="l782"></a>nothing else then a translation out of the Latine, &amp; <a id="l783"></a>that for these reasons.</p>
<p id="par29">First because in the Preface to his edition of <a id="l784"></a>the new Testament we are told that this Testament <a id="l785"></a>was printed after Manuscripts taken out of the Popes <a id="l786"></a>Library, &amp; these the Cardinal only <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n29-ref">[29]</sup> borrowed thence <a id="l787"></a>&amp; therefore returned them back so soon as his <a id="l788"></a>edition was finished: &amp; Caryophilus some time after by <a id="l789"></a>the Popes command collating the Vatican manuscripts <a id="l790"></a>found the testimony of the three in heaven wanting <a id="l791"></a>in them all.  I do not say but that the Cardinal had <a id="l792"></a>other manuscripts, but these were the chief &amp; the <a id="l793"></a>only ones he thought worth the while to tell his <a id="l794"></a>Reader of.</p>
<p id="par30">Secondly I startle at the marginal note in this place <a id="l795"></a>of the Cardinals edition.  ffor it is besides the use of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span> this edition to put notes in the margin of the <a id="l796"></a>greek text.  I have not found it done above <a id="l797"></a>thrice in all this edition of the new Testament, <a id="l798"></a>&amp; therefore there must be something extraor<a id="l799"></a>dinary in it; &amp; that in respect of the Greek <a id="l800"></a>because tis in the margin of this text.  In 1 Cor. <a id="l801"></a>15 there is noted in this margin a notable va<a id="l802"></a>riation in the greek reading.  In Matt. 6.13 where <a id="l803"></a>they in their edition recede from the greek <a id="l804"></a>copies &amp;  correct it by the Latine,  they make a marginal note to <a id="l806"></a>justify their doing so.  And so here where the <a id="l807"></a>testimony of the three in heaven is generally <a id="l808"></a>wanting  in the greek copies, they make a third <a id="l809"></a>marginal note to secure themselves from being <a id="l810"></a>blamed for printing it.  Now in such a case as this is there <a id="l811"></a>is no question but that they would make the <a id="l812"></a>best defense they could, &amp; yet they do not tell <a id="l813"></a>of any various lections in their greek manuscripts <a id="l814"></a>nor produce any one greek manuscript on their <a id="l815"></a>side, but run to the authority of Thomas Aqui<a id="l816"></a>nas.  The greek manuscripts have the text thus: <a id="l817"></a><em class="underline">For there are three that bear record, the spirit <a id="l818"></a>the water &amp; the blood, &amp; these three are one</em>.  <a id="l819"></a>In many of the latine manuscripts the words <a id="l820"></a><em class="underline">these three are one</em> are here omitted &amp; put <a id="l821"></a>only at the end of the testimony of the three <a id="l822"></a>in heaven before that of the spirit water &amp; <a id="l823"></a>blood: in others they are put after both <a id="l824"></a>testimonies.  In the Complutensian edition they follow the <a id="l825"></a>former copies &amp; justify their doing so by the <a id="l826"></a>authority of Thomas Aquinas. <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup> Thomas, say they, <a id="l827"></a>"in treating of the three which bear witness in heaven <a id="l828"></a>teaches that the words these three are one <a id="l829"></a>are subjoyned for insinuating the unity of the essence <a id="l830"></a>of the three persons: And whereas one Ioachim <a id="l831"></a>interpreted this unity to be only in love &amp; consent, <a id="l832"></a>it being thus said of the spirit water &amp; blood in <a id="l833"></a>some copies that these three are one; Thomas <a id="l834"></a>replied that this last clause is not extant in <a id="l835"></a>the true copies but was added by the Arians <a id="l836"></a>for perverting the sense."  Thus far this Anno<a id="l837"></a>tation.  Now this plainly respects the latine copies <a id="l838"></a>(for Thomas understood not Greek) &amp; therefore <a id="l839"></a>part of the designe of this annotation is to set right <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span> the Latine reading.  But this is not the main designe, for so the <a id="l840"></a>annotation should have been set in the margin of the Latin <a id="l841"></a>Version.  It's being set in the margin of the Greek text shews <a id="l842"></a>that it's main designe is to justify the greek by the Latine <a id="l843"></a>thus rectified &amp; confirmed. Now to make Thomas thus in a few <a id="l844"></a>words do all the work was very artificial, &amp; in Spain where <a id="l845"></a>Thomas is of Apostolic authority might pass for a very <a id="l846"></a>judicious &amp; substantial defense of the printed Greek: but <a id="l847"></a>to us Thomas Aquinas is no Apostle; we are seeking for the <a id="l848"></a>authority of greek manuscripts.</p>
<p id="par31">A third reason why I conceive the Complutensian Greek <a id="l849"></a>to have been in this place a translation from the Latine is because <a id="l850"></a>Stunica, who, as I told you, was one of the Divines em<a id="l851"></a>ployed by the Cardinal in this Edition &amp; at that very <a id="l852"></a>time wrote against Erasmus, when in his Objections he comes <a id="l853"></a>to this text of the testimony of the three in heaven, he cites <a id="l854"></a>not one Greek Manuscript for it against Erasmus, but argues <a id="l855"></a>wholy from the authority of the Latine.  On the contrary he <a id="l856"></a>sets down by way of concession, the common reading of the greek <a id="l857"></a>Manuscripts (his own &amp; others,) in these words Ὅτι τρεις ἐισιν ὁι <a id="l858"></a>μαρτυρουντες τὸ πνευμα καὶ τὸ ὑδωρ καὶ τὸ ἁιμα καὶ ὁι τρεις ἐις <a id="l859"></a>τὸ ἕν ἐισι, &amp; then he condemns them all together without ex<a id="l860"></a>ception &amp; justifies the Latine against them by the  autho<a id="l861"></a>rity of Ierom.  <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup> <em class="underline">Know</em>, saith he, <em class="underline"> that in this place the greek Manu<a id="l862"></a>scripts are most evidently corrupted, but ours</em> (that is the Latin <a id="l863"></a>ones) <em class="underline">contein the truth it self as they are translated from the <a id="l864"></a>first original.  Which is manifest by the Prologue of S. Ierome <a id="l865"></a>upon the Epistles</em>, &amp;c  And this Prologue (which he goes on to cite at <a id="l866"></a>length &amp; of which we gave you an account above) is all he urges <a id="l867"></a>in favour of the testimony of the three in heaven.  In other <a id="l868"></a>places of scripture where he had greek Manuscripts on his <a id="l869"></a>side, he produces them readily.  So in 1 Thes. 2.7. <em class="underline">Ita quidem <a id="l870"></a>legitur</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">in græcis codicibus quos ego viderim</em>.  In <a id="l871"></a>Iames 1.1 he saith, <em class="underline">Sciendum in omnibus græcis codicibus</em> <a id="l872"></a>πορείας <em class="underline">hic legi per ei dipthongum</em>.  In 1 Thes. 5.23. he <a id="l873"></a>saith, <em class="underline">cùm in græcis exemplaribus quotquot sunt</em> ὁλόκληρον <a id="l874"></a><em class="underline">et in Latinis integet hic legatur per nemine discrepante, <a id="l875"></a>nescio cur Erasmus dixerit</em> &amp;c.  In Phil 4.9 <em class="underline">Siquidem in omnibus</em>, <a id="l876"></a>saith he, <em class="underline">græcis codicibus</em> ταυτα λογίζεσθε <em class="underline">hic legitur – neque græci <a id="l877"></a>sunt libri qui</em> πραττέτε <em class="underline">hoc loco neque latini qui agite, nisi <a id="l878"></a>mendosos utriusque linguæ codices cùm hæc commentaretur Erasmus <a id="l879"></a>perlegit</em>.  After this manner does Stunica produce the manu<a id="l880"></a>scripts used in the Complutensian edition when they make for <a id="l881"></a>him &amp; here he produces them too but 'tis for Erasmus <a id="l882"></a>against himself.  <em class="underline">Know</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">that in this place the greek <a id="l883"></a>manuscripts are most evidently corrupted</em>.  In other places if he <a id="l884"></a>hath but one manuscript on his side, he produces it magnificently <a id="l885"></a>enough, as the Codex Rhodiensis in his discourse upon 2 Cor. 2.3 <a id="l886"></a>Iames 1.22. 2 Pet. 2.2. &amp; other texts: here he produces all the <a id="l887"></a>Manuscripts against himself without excepting so much as one.  <a id="l888"></a>And hence Erasmus in his answer to Stunica gloried in the <a id="l889"></a>consent of the Spanish manuscripts with his own, &amp; Sanctus <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021r"> &lt;21r&gt; </span> Caranza (another of the Complutensian Divines) in his defense <a id="l890"></a>of Stunica written presently after, had nothing to reply in this <a id="l891"></a>point.  Neither could Sepulueda or the Spanish Moncks who <a id="l892"></a>next undertook the controversy find any one greek manuscript <a id="l893"></a>which here made against Erasmus.  Nor had Marchio Velesius <a id="l894"></a>better successe, thô on that occasion he collated 16 greek <a id="l895"></a>manuscripts, eight whereof belonged to the King of Spain's library <a id="l896"></a>&amp; the other eight to other libraries in Spain, &amp; did it on <a id="l897"></a>purpose to collect out of them whatever he could meet with in <a id="l898"></a>favour of the present vulgar Latine.  Neither did the re<a id="l899"></a>printing of the Complutensian Bible by Arias Montanus, produce <a id="l900"></a>the notice of any such manuscript, tho on that occasion many <a id="l901"></a>Manuscripts as well greek as latine fetcht from Complutum &amp; <a id="l902"></a>other places were collated by Arias, Lucas Brugensis, Canter &amp; <a id="l903"></a>others. So then to summe up the argument, the Complutensian Divines did sometimes correct the greek <a id="l904"></a>by the Latine without the authority of any one greek Ma<a id="l905"></a>nuscript, as appears by their practise in Mat. 6.13, &amp; there<a id="l906"></a>fore their printing  the testimony of the three in heaven <a id="l907"></a>is no evidence  that they did it by a manuscript.   But on the contrary for want <a id="l908"></a>of one they contented themselves with the authority of Thomas <a id="l909"></a>Aquinas, &amp; Stunica confest they had none.  Nor has all the zeal for this <a id="l910"></a>text  been able since to discover one either in Spain or <a id="l911"></a>any where else.</p>
<p id="par32">And now you may understand whence it is that the Compluten<a id="l912"></a>sian edition &amp; the reading of the pretended English manuscript set down <a id="l913"></a>by Erasmus in his Annotations, differ so much from one another.  ffor <a id="l914"></a>the Complutensian has the text thus Ὅτι τρεις ἐισιν ὁι μαρτυρουν <a id="l915"></a>τες ἐν τωι ὀυρανωι, ὁ παττὴρ ὁ λόγος καὶ τὸ ἅγιον πνευμα καὶ ὁι <a id="l916"></a>τρεις εις τὸ ἕν ἐισι καὶ τρεις ἐισιν ὁι μαρτυρουντες ἐπὶ της <a id="l917"></a>γης τὸ πνευμα καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ τὸ αἱμα.  The pretended English <a id="l918"></a>Manuscript thus Ὅτι τρεις ἐισὶν ὁι μαρτυρουντες ἐν τωι ὀυρανωι, <a id="l919"></a>πατὴρ, λόγος καὶ πνευμα, καὶ ὁυτοι ὁι τρεις ἕν ἐισιν.  Καὶ τρεις <a id="l920"></a>ἐισὶν μαρτυρουντες ἐν τηι γηι πνευμα καὶ ὕδωρ καὶ ἁιμα.  The differ<a id="l921"></a>ences are too great to spring from the bare errors of scribes &amp; arise rather <a id="l922"></a>from the various translation of the place out of Latin into Greek by two se<a id="l923"></a>veral persons.</p>
<p id="par33">But whilst these two readings by their discord confute one another, the <a id="l924"></a>readings of the real Greek manuscripts by their agreement confirm one <a id="l925"></a>another as much.  For Caryophilus who by the command of Pope Vrban <a id="l926"></a>the 8<sup>th</sup> collated the Vatican &amp; other manuscripts borrowed out of the princi<a id="l927"></a>pal Libraries in Rome, found one common reading in them all without <a id="l928"></a>the testimony of the three in heaven as you may see in those his Colla<a id="l929"></a>tions printed anno 1673 by Peter Possinus in the end of his Catena <a id="l930"></a>of the Greek Fathers upon Mark.

<p id="par34">The very same reading Erasmus in his Annotations <a id="l936"></a>on this place gives us of all his manuscripts which were more then <a id="l937"></a>seven &amp; so doth Stephens of all his seven without noting any various lections in <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022r"> &lt;22r&gt; </span>  them.  Only the comma which in Stephen's Edition is (surely <a id="l938"></a>by mistake) set after οὐρανωι, is to be put in it's right place.  <a id="l939"></a>The very same reading does Stunica also in his book against <a id="l940"></a>Erasmus note out of the Manuscripts he had seen in Spain, <a id="l941"></a>as was shewed above: nor does Velesius in his collation of <a id="l942"></a>the sixteen Spanish manuscripts note any various lections in <a id="l943"></a>this text.  The same reading exactly have also the manuscripts <a id="l944"></a>in England, namely that most ancient &amp; most famous one <a id="l945"></a>in the Kings Library which was conveyed thither from Egypt <a id="l946"></a>through Greece &amp; published in Walton's Polyglott Bible &amp; the <a id="l947"></a>four at Oxford, viz<sup>t</sup> that in New College, &amp; that in <a id="l948"></a>Magdalen College (both very old) &amp; two in Lincoln College, <a id="l949"></a>&amp; five other ancient ones lately brought out of Turkey <a id="l950"></a>by M<sup>r</sup> Covel &amp; collated by D<sup>r</sup> Mills.  The very same <a id="l951"></a>reading have also the three Manuscripts of Monsieur Petavius <a id="l952"></a>Gachon a Senator of Paris, whose various lections collected <a id="l953"></a>by his son Iohn Gachon, were printed in the Oxford edition of <a id="l954"></a>the new Testament A.C. 1675.  The same reading without <a id="l955"></a>any variation is published by Francis Asulan in his edition <a id="l956"></a>printed A.C. 1518 by Aldus  at Venice out of <a id="l957"></a>the Manuscripts of those parts.  The same reading Oecu<a id="l958"></a>menius six hundred years ago found in the Manuscripts <a id="l959"></a>of Greece as you may see in the text of his Commenta<a id="l960"></a>ry on this Epistle of Iohn.  The same reading also Cyril <a id="l961"></a>of Alexandria met with in the manuscripts of Egypt <a id="l962"></a>above eleven hundred years ago, as you may see in his <a id="l963"></a>citations of the text, both in his Thesaurus lib. 14 c. 5, <a id="l964"></a>&amp; in his first book de fide ad Reginas: excepting that <a id="l965"></a>in the latter of these two citations the particle ἐις is <a id="l966"></a>omitted &amp; μαρτυρουσι written for ὁι μαρτυρουντες.  And that the very same reading was also in the <a id="l967"></a>manuscripts of the first ages may be gathered from the con<a id="l968"></a>formity of this reading to all the ancient Versions.</p>
<p id="par35">It may seem by what has been hitherto said that this <a id="l969"></a>Testimony is not to be found in Greek Manuscripts. <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup> Epanortho<a id="l970"></a>tes whom Lucas Brugensis describes to be an ancient accu<a id="l971"></a>rate full &amp; industrious Collator of Manuscripts, found it <a id="l972"></a>wanting in all those he met with.  <em class="underline">Epanorthotes</em>, saith <a id="l973"></a>Lucas, <em class="underline">deesse hæc eadem Græcis libris et antiquis Latinis <a id="l974"></a>annotat</em>.

After the disputes of those times, <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> Hesselius <a id="l981"></a>about the year 1565 Professor of Divinity at Lovain, in <a id="l982"></a>his Commentary on this place ingeniously confesses it wanting <a id="l983"></a>in all the greek manuscripts then known except two, the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023r-b"> &lt;23r&gt; </span> 
one in Spain the other in England, meaning those by which the <a id="l984"></a>Complutensian Divines &amp; Erasmus printed it: which two we <a id="l985"></a>have shewed to be none at all, unlesse some Annius dug up one in England..  Since that time nothing <a id="l986"></a>further has been produced besides the imaginary books of <a id="l987"></a>the dreaming Beza.  And yet I will not say but that it <a id="l988"></a>may be hereafter found in some Greek copies.  For in the <a id="l989"></a>times of the holy war the Latines had much to do in <a id="l990"></a>the East.  They were long united to the Greek Church: <a id="l991"></a>They made Latine Patriarchs of Ierusalem &amp; Antioch; <a id="l992"></a>they reigned at Constantinople over the Greeks from the <a id="l993"></a>year 1204 for above 50 years together, &amp; during this their <a id="l994"></a>Kingdom in the year 1215 was assembled the Late<a id="l995"></a>ran Council consisting of 415 Bishops Greeks &amp; Latines <a id="l996"></a>together, &amp; therein the testimony of the three in heaven <a id="l997"></a>was quoted out of some of the Latine manuscripts as we <a id="l998"></a>told you above.  All which might occasion some Greeks as <a id="l999"></a>well as Latines to note it in the Margins of their books <a id="l1000"></a>&amp; thence insert it into the text in transcribing.  For this <a id="l1001"></a>is most certain that some greek manuscripts have been <a id="l1002"></a>corrected by the Latine ones.  Such a book <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> Erasmus tells <a id="l1003"></a>us he once met with, &amp; that there was such another in <a id="l1004"></a>the Popes Library.  He suspected also that Boook in England out of <a id="l1005"></a>which he printed the testimony of the three in heaven to be of <a id="l1006"></a>the same kind, tho I rather think 'twas none at all unless  some Italians of that age were at the pains to transcribe one or two of S<sup>t</sup> Paul's Epistles.  Such <a id="l1007"></a>another book was one of those out of which Velesius collected <a id="l1008"></a>his various lections.  Whence Mariana into whose hands the <a id="l1009"></a>manuscript boook of those Lections fell, tells us that for <a id="l1010"></a>that reason in his annotations on the new Testament he used <a id="l1011"></a>those lections but sparingly &amp; cautiously.  And that Velesius did <a id="l1012"></a>meet with such a corrected manuscript appears by the Lections <a id="l1013"></a>themselves.  For in Apoc. 18.17, where the Greek reads ἐπὶ <a id="l1014"></a>τόπον &amp; the Latine translates <em class="underline">in locum</em> &amp; by the error of <a id="l1015"></a>one letter in <em class="underline">lacum</em>, as the books now have it: some Grecian <a id="l1016"></a>here has corrected his book by the Latine &amp; written ἐπὶ <a id="l1017"></a>λίμνην as tis in the lections of Velesius taken out of <a id="l1018"></a>this manuscript.  Again in Apoc 9.11 where the Latine transla<a id="l1019"></a>tor in expounding the names <em class="underline">Abaddon</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Apollyon</em> adds, <em class="underline">Et <a id="l1020"></a>latine habens nomen exterminans</em>, Velesius notes the reading <a id="l1021"></a>in his Greek Copy to be ρὡμαιστὶ ἔχων ὄνομα ἐξτέρμινανς: <a id="l1022"></a>which certainly is a translation of the Latine.  Again <a id="l1023"></a>in Apoc. 21.12 where the Greek has ἀγγέλους, and some ancient Latine copies <em class="underline">angelos</em>, but the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024r"> &lt;24r&gt; </span> 
far greater part of the Latine copies at present <em class="underline">angulos</em> Velesius <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>in<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l1024"></a>his MS reads γωνίας. So in Apoc 19.6 where the Greek is ὄχλου πολλου &amp; <a id="l1025"></a>the Latine <em class="underline">turbæ magnæ</em> &amp; in later copies <em class="underline">tubæ magnæ</em>, Velesius in his MS <a id="l1026"></a>reads σάλπιγγος μεγάλης. In Heb. 13.2 for ἔλαθον <em class="underline">latuerunt</em> &amp; in <a id="l1027"></a>later copies <em class="underline">placuerunt</em> Velesius reads ἤρεσαν: &amp; in 1 Pet. 3.8, for τὸ <a id="l1028"></a>δὲ τέλος <em class="underline">In fine</em> &amp; by error <em class="underline">In fide</em> Velesius reads ἐν τη πίστει δὲ.  These <a id="l1029"></a>&amp; such like instances put the thing out of dispute.  Now tho Velesius <a id="l1030"></a>found not the testimony of the three in heaven in this Manuscript, &amp; Erasmus <a id="l1031"></a>tells us he never saw it in any greek manuscript, &amp; by consequence not <a id="l1032"></a>in that corrected one which fell into his hands: yet it may have crept out <a id="l1033"></a>of the Latine into some other books not yet taken notice of, &amp; even in some <a id="l1034"></a>MSS which in other places have not been corrected by the Latine, it may <a id="l1035"></a>possibly have been inserted by some of the Greek Bishops of the Lateran <a id="l1036"></a>Council where the testimony of the three in heaven was read.  And there<a id="l1037"></a>fore he that shall hereafter meet with it in any book, ought first before he <a id="l1038"></a>insists upon the authority of that book, to examin whether it hath not <a id="l1039"></a>been corrected by the Latine, &amp; whether it be ancienter then the Lateran <a id="l1040"></a>Councel &amp; empire of the Latines in Greece.  ffor if it be liable to <a id="l1041"></a>either of those two exceptions it can signify nothing to produce it.</p>
<p id="par36">Having given you the history of the controversy, I shal now <a id="l1042"></a>confirm all that I have said from the sense of the text it self.  ffor <a id="l1043"></a>without the testimony of the three in heaven the sense is good &amp; easy, <a id="l1044"></a>as you may see by the following paraphrase inserted into the text in <a id="l1045"></a>a different character.</p>
<p id="par37"><sup class="note" id="n36-ref">[36]</sup><em class="underline"><strong>Who is he that overcometh the world but he that beleiveth <a id="l1046"></a>that Iesus Christ is the Son of God</strong></em>, that son spoken of in the <a id="l1047"></a>Psalmes where he saith Thou art my son this day have I begotten <a id="l1048"></a>thee.  <em class="underline"><strong>This is he that</strong></em> after the Iews had long expected him, <em class="underline"><strong>came</strong></em> <a id="l1049"></a>first in a mortal body <em class="underline"><strong>by</strong></em> baptism of <em class="underline"><strong>water and</strong></em> then in an <a id="l1050"></a>immortal one by shedding his <em class="underline"><strong>blood</strong></em> upon the crosse &amp; rising again <a id="l1051"></a>from the dead: <em class="underline"><strong>not by water only but by water &amp; blood</strong></em>: <a id="l1052"></a>being the son of God as well <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n37-ref">[37]</sup> by his resurrection from the dead <a id="l1053"></a>as <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup> by his supernatural birth of the Virgin: <em class="underline"><strong>and it is the <a id="l1054"></a>spirit</strong></em> also <em class="underline"><strong>that</strong></em> together with the water &amp; blood  <em class="underline"><strong>beareth witnesse</strong></em> of the truth of his coming, <em class="underline"><strong>because the <a id="l1056"></a>spirit is truth</strong></em>, &amp; so a fit &amp; unexceptionable witnesse.  <em class="underline"><strong>For there <a id="l1057"></a>are three that bear record</strong></em> of his coming, <em class="underline"><strong>the Spirit</strong></em> which he <a id="l1058"></a>promised to send, &amp; which was since shed forth upon us in the form <a id="l1059"></a>of cloven tongues &amp; in various gifts, <em class="underline"><strong>the</strong></em> baptism of <em class="underline"><strong>water</strong></em> wherein <a id="l1060"></a>God testified this is my beloved son, <em class="underline"><strong>and the</strong></em> shedding of his <em class="underline"><strong>blood</strong></em> <a id="l1061"></a>accompanied with his resurrection whereby he became the most <a id="l1062"></a>faithful martyr or witnesse of this truth.  <em class="underline"><strong>And these three</strong></em>, <a id="l1063"></a>the Spirit, the baptism &amp; the passion of Christ <em class="underline"><strong>agree in</strong></em> witness<a id="l1064"></a>ing <em class="underline"><strong>one</strong></em> &amp; the same thing (namely that  <a id="l1065"></a>the Son of God is come,) &amp; therefore their evidence is strong.  <a id="l1066"></a>For the Law requires but two consenting witnesses, &amp; here we <a id="l1067"></a>have three.  And <em class="underline"><strong>if wee receive the witness of men the</strong></em> <a id="l1068"></a>threefold <em class="underline"><strong>witnesse of God</strong></em> which he bare of his Son, by declar<a id="l1069"></a>ing at his baptism This is my beloved Son, by raising him <a id="l1070"></a>from the dead, &amp; by pouring out his spirit on us, <em class="underline"><strong>is greater</strong></em> <a id="l1071"></a>&amp; therefore ought to be more readily received.</p>
<p id="par38">Thus is the sense plain &amp; natural &amp; the argument full &amp; strong, <a id="l1072"></a>but if you insert the testimony of the three in heaven you interrupt <a id="l1073"></a>&amp; spoil it.  ffor the whole designe of the Apostle being here to <a id="l1074"></a>prove to men by witnesses the truth of Christs coming, I would <a id="l1075"></a>ask how the testimony of the three in heaven makes to this purpose. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025r"> &lt;25r&gt; </span>
If their testimony be not given to men how does it prove to them <a id="l1076"></a>the truth of Christs coming?  If it be, how is the testimony in heaven <a id="l1077"></a>distinguished from that in earth?  Tis the same Spirit which witnesses <a id="l1078"></a>in heaven &amp; in earth.  If in both cases it witnesses to us men, wherein <a id="l1079"></a>lies the difference between its witnessing in heaven &amp; its witnessing in <a id="l1080"></a>earth?  If in the first case it does not witnesse to men, to whom <a id="l1081"></a>does it witnesse, &amp; to what purpose? &amp; how does its witnessing <a id="l1082"></a>make to the designe of Iohn's discourse?  Let them make good sense <a id="l1083"></a>of it who are able: for my part I can make none.  If it <a id="l1084"></a>be said that we are not to determin what's scripture &amp; what <a id="l1085"></a>not by our private judgments, I confesse it in places not controverted: <a id="l1086"></a>but in disputable places I love to take up with what I can <a id="l1087"></a>best understand.  Tis the temper of the hot &amp; superstitious part of <a id="l1088"></a>mankind in matters of religion ever to be fond of mysteries, <a id="l1089"></a>&amp; for that reason to like best what they understand least.  <a id="l1090"></a>Such men may use the Apostle Iohn as they please: but I <a id="l1091"></a>have that honour for him as to beleive he wrote good sense, <a id="l1092"></a>&amp; therefore take that sense to be his which is the best: espe<a id="l1093"></a>cially since I am defended in it by so great authority.  For I <a id="l1094"></a>have on my side the authority of the fourth generall Council, <a id="l1095"></a>&amp; (so far as I know) of all the Churches in all ages except the <a id="l1096"></a>modern Latines &amp; such others as have lately been influenced <a id="l1097"></a>by them, &amp; that also of all the old Versions &amp; greek manuscripts <a id="l1098"></a>&amp; ancient Latine ones; &amp; nothing against me but the authority <a id="l1099"></a>of Ierome, &amp; the credulity &amp; heat of his followers.  For to <a id="l1100"></a>tell us of other manuscripts without ever letting us know in <a id="l1101"></a>what Libraries they were to be seen; to pretend MSS which <a id="l1102"></a>since their first discovery could never be heard of, nor <a id="l1103"></a>were then seen by persons whose names &amp; credit we know, <a id="l1104"></a>is plainly to impose upon the learned world, &amp; ought not <a id="l1105"></a>to passe any longer for fair dealing.  The Spaniards tell <a id="l1106"></a>us plainly that they followed the Latine, &amp; by the autho<a id="l1107"></a>rity of Thomas left out the clause <em class="underline">and these three are <a id="l1108"></a>one</em> in the 8<sup>th</sup> verse as inserted by the Arians: &amp; yet <a id="l1109"></a>S. Ambrose, S. Austin, Eucherius &amp; other Latines in the Arian <a id="l1110"></a>age gathered the unity of the Deity from this clause, <a id="l1111"></a>&amp; the omission of it is now by printing it acknowledged to be <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n39-ref">[39]</sup> an erro<a id="l1112"></a>neous correction.  The pretended Manuscript in England wanted the <a id="l1113"></a>same clause &amp; therefore if there was any such MS it was a corrected one like the Spanish <a id="l1114"></a>Edition &amp; the  manuscript of Velesius.  Erasmus who printed the triple <a id="l1115"></a>testimony in heaven by that  English MS, never saw it, <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n40-ref">[40]</sup> tells <a id="l1116"></a>us it was a new one, suspected its sincerity &amp; accused it pub<a id="l1117"></a>lickly in his writings on several occasions for several years toge<a id="l1118"></a>ther:  &amp;  yet his adversaries in England never answered his <a id="l1120"></a>accusation, never endeavoured to satisfy him &amp; the world about it, <a id="l1121"></a>did not so much as let us know where the record might be consulted for confuting him: but on the contrary when they had got the Trinity into his Edition, <a id="l1122"></a>threw by their MS (if they had one) as an Almanack out of date.  And <a id="l1123"></a>can such shuffling dealings satisfy considering men?  Let Manuscripts <a id="l1124"></a>at length be produced, &amp; freely exposed to the sight of the learned <a id="l1125"></a>world, but let such MSS be produced as are of authority; or <a id="l1126"></a>else let it be confest that whilst Ierome pretended to correct the <a id="l1127"></a>Latin by the Greek, the Latines have corrected both the Latin &amp; the <a id="l1128"></a>Greek by the sole authority of Ierome.</p>

<p id="par39">What the Latines have done to this text the Greeks <a id="l1129"></a>have done to that of S. Paul 1 Tim. 3.16.

For this is the common reading of the Ethiopic, Syriac <a id="l1136"></a>&amp; Latine Versions to this day, Ierome's manuscripts <a id="l1137"></a>having given him no occasion to correct the old Vulgar <a id="l1138"></a>Latine in this place.

Pauls Epistles generally have it to this <a id="l1184"></a>day; &amp; therefore it cannot be doubted but that this <a id="l1185"></a>hath been the constant public reading of the Latine <a id="l1186"></a>Churches from the beginning.  So also one of the Arians <a id="l1187"></a>in a Homily printed in Fulgentius's works reads Ὃ &amp; <a id="l1188"></a>interprets it of the son of God who was born of the Father <a id="l1189"></a><em class="underline">ante sæcula</em> &amp; of the Virgin <em class="underline">in novissimo tempore</em>: &amp; Ful<a id="l1190"></a>gentius in his answer to this Homily found no fault with <a id="l1191"></a>the citation, but on the contrary in his first book ad <a id="l1192"></a>Trasimundum, chap. 6, seems to have read &amp; understood the <a id="l1193"></a>text after the same manner with other Latines.</p>
<p id="par41">Now for the Greeks, I find indeed that they have <a id="l1194"></a>changed the ancient reading of the text not only in the MSS <a id="l1195"></a>of S. Pauls Epistles but also in other authors, &amp;  yet <a id="l1196"></a>there are still remaining sufficient instances among them <a id="l1197"></a>of what the reading was at first.  So in Chrysostom's <a id="l1198"></a>Commentary on this Epistle they have now gotten θεὸς <a id="l1199"></a>into the text &amp; yet by considering the Commentary it <a id="l1200"></a>self I am satisfied that he read ὃ.  For he neither <a id="l1201"></a>in this Commentary nor any where else infers the Deity <a id="l1202"></a>of Christ from this text nor expounds it as they do <a id="l1203"></a>who read θεὸς, but with the Latines &amp; others who read ὃ <a id="l1204"></a>understands by it Christ incarnate, or as he expresses it <a id="l1205"></a>Man made God &amp; God made man, &amp; so leaves it at liberty <a id="l1206"></a>to be taken for either God or Man.  And accordingly in one  place of his commentary he saith ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκὶ <a id="l1207"></a>ὁ δημιουργὸς, in another place Ἄνθρωπος ὤφθη ἀναμάρ<a id="l1208"></a>τητος, ἄνθρωπος ἀναλήφθη, ἐκηρύχθη ἐν κόσμωι, μεθ᾽ <a id="l1209"></a>ἡμων ειδον ἀυτὸν ὁι ἄγγελοι.  Man appeared without sin.  <a id="l1210"></a>Man was received up, was preached in the world, was seen <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p028r"> &lt;28r&gt; </span> amongst us by Angels.  Instead of ὃ ἐφανηρώθη ἐν σαρκι, <a id="l1211"></a>εδικαιώθη ἐν πνέυματι, he saith Man appeared without <a id="l1212"></a>sin, making man the nominative case to these &amp; all the <a id="l1213"></a>verbs which follow: which certainly he would not have <a id="l1214"></a>done had θεὸς been their nominative case expresly in his text.  <a id="l1215"></a>He might  properly put man for ὃ but not for <a id="l1216"></a>θεὸς  Neither could he have put ἀναμάρτητος for ἐδι<a id="l1217"></a>καιώθη if he had read in his text ἐδικαιώθη: <a id="l1218"></a>for what man of common sense would say that God was made <a id="l1219"></a>sinlesse in or through the spirit.  But what I have said of <a id="l1220"></a>Chrysostom will be more evident when I shall have shewed <a id="l1221"></a>you how afterwards in the time of the Nestorian contro<a id="l1222"></a>versy, all parties read ὃ or ὃς without  any dispute raised <a id="l1223"></a>about the reading, &amp; how the Greeks have since corrupted <a id="l1224"></a>the text in Cyrills writings, &amp; changed ὃ &amp; ὃς into θεὸς as they have done <a id="l1225"></a>in Chrysostom's.</p>
<p id="par42">And first that the Nestorians read ὃ is evident by <a id="l1226"></a>some fragments of the Orations or Homilies of Nestorius sent by him <a id="l1227"></a>to the Pope &amp; cited by Arnobius junior in the second book of the <a id="l1228"></a>Conflict with Serapion.  For there to shew what was the <a id="l1229"></a>opinion of Nestorius &amp; how he  defended it, <a id="l1230"></a>he cites two of his Orations in these words.  <em class="underline">Non pepe<a id="l1231"></a>rit sanctissima Maria Deitatem, nam quod natum est de <a id="l1232"></a>carne caro est.  Non peperit creatura creatorem sed <a id="l1233"></a>peperit hominem Deitatis ministrum.  Non ædificavit <a id="l1234"></a>Deum Verbum Spiritus sanctus: quod ex ipsa natum <a id="l1235"></a>est de spiritu sancto est.  Deo itaque Verbo templum <a id="l1236"></a>ex Virgine ædificavit</em>.  Et paulo post.  <em class="underline">Qui per se <a id="l1237"></a>natus est Deus in utero</em> [scil. ante Luciferum] <em class="underline">Deus est</em>.  <a id="l1238"></a>Et paulo post.  <em class="underline">Θεοτόκου formam in Deo honoramus</em>.  Et in alia prædicatione: <em class="underline">Spiritum divina separat <a id="l1239"></a>natura qui humanitatem ejus creavit.  Quicquid ex Maria <a id="l1240"></a>natum est de spiritu sancto est, qui et secundum justiciam <a id="l1241"></a>replevit quod creatum est, hoc quod manifestatum est in <a id="l1242"></a>carne justificatum est in spiritu</em>.  Which last words in <a id="l1243"></a>the language wherein Nestorius wrote those Homilies <a id="l1244"></a>are ὃ ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκὶ, ἐδικαιώθη ἐν πνεύματι..  <a id="l1245"></a>Here you see Nestorius reads ὃ expresly, &amp; not only <a id="l1246"></a>so but absolutely excludes God from being understood <a id="l1247"></a>by it: arguing that the Virgin was not θεοτόκος be<a id="l1248"></a>cause that thing which was manifested in the flesh, was <a id="l1249"></a>justified in the spirit,  or (as he expounds it) replenish<a id="l1250"></a>ed by the spirit in righteousnes; &amp; calling that thing which was manifested in the flesh <a id="l1251"></a>a creature.  <em class="underline">Spiritus</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">secundum justiciam reple<a id="l1252"></a>vit</em> [hoc] <em class="underline">quod creatum est</em>, [nempe] <em class="underline">hoc quod manifesta<a id="l1253"></a>tum est in carne, justificatum est in spiritu</em>.</p>
<p id="par43">And now whilst he read the text after this manner <a id="l1254"></a>&amp; urged it thus against the Deity of Christ, one would <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p029r"> &lt;29r&gt; </span> expect that if this had not been the received public reading <a id="l1255"></a>in the greek churches his adversaries would have fallen <a id="l1256"></a>foul upon him &amp; exclaimed against him for falsifying <a id="l1257"></a>the text &amp; blasphemously saying it was a created thing <a id="l1258"></a>which the scripture calls God manifested in the flesh.  And <a id="l1259"></a>such an accusation as this would surely have made as <a id="l1260"></a>great a noise as any thing else in the controversy.  And <a id="l1261"></a>yet I meet with nothing of this kind in history.  His adver<a id="l1262"></a>saries do not so much as tell him that Θεὸς was in the <a id="l1263"></a>text.  They were so far from raising any controversy <a id="l1264"></a>about the reading that they do not in the least correct <a id="l1265"></a>him for it but on the contrary they themselves in their <a id="l1266"></a>answers to his writings read ὃ as he did &amp; only laboured <a id="l1267"></a>by various disputations to put another sense upon the <a id="l1268"></a>text: as I find by Cassian &amp; Cyril the two principal <a id="l1269"></a>who at that time wrote against him.</p>
<p id="par44">Iohn Cassian was Chrysostom's scholar &amp; his Deacon <a id="l1270"></a>&amp; Legate to the Pope &amp; after the banishment of Chry<a id="l1271"></a>sostome retired from Constantinople into Syria &amp; Egypt <a id="l1272"></a>where he lived a monastic life for some time &amp; then <a id="l1273"></a>ended his days in France.  At that  time therefore <a id="l1274"></a>when Nestorius, who was Patriarch of Constantinople <a id="l1275"></a>broached his opinion &amp; Cyril the Patriarch of Alex<a id="l1276"></a>andria opposed him, Nestorius sent a Legacy to  Rome <a id="l1277"></a>with copies of his Orations to let the Pope understand <a id="l1278"></a>the controversy: &amp; thereupon Leo the great, who was then Arch<a id="l1279"></a>deacon of  the Church of Rome &amp; afterwards Pope, <a id="l1280"></a>put Cassian (then in France) upon writing his book De <a id="l1281"></a>incarnatione Domini against Nestorius.  He wrote it there<a id="l1282"></a>fore in the year 430, as Baronius also reccons: for he <a id="l1283"></a>wrote it before the condemnation of Nestorius in the <a id="l1284"></a>Council of Ephesus, as appears by the book it self.  This <a id="l1285"></a>book is now extant only in latine: but  considering <a id="l1286"></a>that his designe in writing  was to stir up the <a id="l1287"></a>greek Church against Nestorius, &amp; that for making <a id="l1288"></a>the greater impression upon them he quotes  <a id="l1289"></a>greek Fathers at the end of his book, &amp; concludes <a id="l1290"></a>with  an exhortation to the Citizens of Constantinople, telling <a id="l1291"></a>them that what he wrote for, he had received from his master <a id="l1292"></a>Chrysostom, I am satisfied that he wrote it originally in greek.  His other books were in both languages, <a id="l1293"></a>for Photius saw them in eloquent Greek; &amp; its more <a id="l1294"></a>likely that they had their Authors eloquent language <a id="l1295"></a>from their Author &amp; the Latine from one of the La<a id="l1296"></a>tines where he lived, then that the contrary should be <a id="l1297"></a>true.  Now in this treatise lib 7 c 18, when he comes to <a id="l1298"></a>consider the passage of Nestorius about this text, of which <a id="l1299"></a>we gave you an account above out of Arnobius: he returns <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030r"> &lt;30r&gt; </span> this answer to it.  <em class="underline">Iamprimum enim hoc ais</em> [Nestorj] <em class="underline">quia <a id="l1300"></a>justicia repleverit quod creatum est; et hoc Apostolico <a id="l1301"></a>vis testimonio comprobare quod dicat, Apparuit in carne <a id="l1302"></a>justificatus est in spiritu: utrumque falso sensu et furioso <a id="l1303"></a>spiritu loqueris. Quia ut hoc quod a spiritu vis eum <a id="l1304"></a>repletum esse justicia, ideo ponis ut ostendas ejus vacui<a id="l1305"></a>tatem cui præstitam esse asseris justiciæ ad impletionem.  <a id="l1306"></a>Et hoc quod super hac re Apostolico testimonio uteris <a id="l1307"></a>divini testimonij ordinem rationemque furoris.  Non enim <a id="l1308"></a>ita ab Apostolo positum est ut tu id truncatum vitia<a id="l1309"></a>tumque posuisti.  Quid enim Apostolus ait?  Et mani<a id="l1310"></a>festè magnum est pietatis sacramentum <strong>quod</strong> mani<a id="l1311"></a>festatum est in carne justificatum est in spiritu.  <a id="l1312"></a>Vides ergo quod mysterium pietatis vel sacramentum <a id="l1313"></a>justificatum Apostolus prædicavit</em>.  Thus far Cassian, <a id="l1314"></a>not only reading Ὃ but confuting Nestorius by that <a id="l1315"></a>reading.  For whereas Nestorius said it was a crea<a id="l1316"></a>ture which was justified, Cassian tells him that if he had <a id="l1317"></a>read the whole text he would have found that it was <a id="l1318"></a>the mystery of godlinesse.  <em class="underline">Vides ergo</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">quod mys<a id="l1319"></a>terium pietatis justificatum Apostolus prædicavit</em>.  He does <a id="l1320"></a>not say <em class="underline">Deum justificatum Apostolus prædificavit</em>, (as he would cer<a id="l1321"></a>tainly have done had that been in  his Bible,) but <a id="l1322"></a><em class="underline">mysterium</em>, &amp; so makes  <em class="underline">mysterium</em> or, which is all one, it's relative <em class="underline">quod</em> <a id="l1324"></a>the nominative case to the verbs which follow.  In another <a id="l1325"></a>part of this Treatise  lib 5. c 12 Cassian cites <a id="l1326"></a>&amp; interprets this text as follows.  <em class="underline">Et manifestè magnum <a id="l1327"></a>est  pietatis sacramentum quod manifestatum est in <a id="l1328"></a>carne &amp;c.  Quid ergo magnum est illud sacramentum <a id="l1329"></a>quod manifestatum est in carne?  Deus scilicet natus <a id="l1330"></a>in carne, Deus visus in corpore, qui utique sicut palam <a id="l1331"></a>est assumptus est in gloria</em>.  So you see, Nestorius &amp; <a id="l1332"></a>Cassian  agree in reading ὃ but differ in  inter<a id="l1333"></a>preting it; the one restraining it to a creature by <a id="l1334"></a>reason of its being justified, the other restraining it to <a id="l1335"></a>God by reason of its being a great mystery &amp; assumed <a id="l1336"></a>in glory.</p>
<p id="par45">In like manner Cyril the grand adversary of <a id="l1337"></a>Nestorius in his three books de fide ad Imperatorem et Re<a id="l1338"></a>ginas written against him in the beginning of that contro<a id="l1339"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p031r"> &lt;31r&gt; </span>versy, did not reprehend him as if he had cited the <a id="l1340"></a>text falsly, but only complained of his misinterpreting <a id="l1341"></a>it; telling him that he did not understand the great <a id="l1342"></a>mystery of godlinesse, &amp; that it was (not a created thing <a id="l1343"></a>as he thought) but the word or son of God, &amp; arguing <a id="l1344"></a>for this interpretation from the circumstances of the <a id="l1345"></a>text.  And first in his book de fide ad Imperatorem sect. 7, he has this passage πλανασθε μὴ ἐιδότες τὰς <a id="l1346"></a>γραφάς μήτε μὴν τὸ μέγα της ἐυσεβείας μυστή<a id="l1347"></a>ριον, τουτέστι Χριστόν ὃς ἐφανερωθη ἐν σαρκὶ ἐδικαι<a id="l1348"></a>ώθη ἐν πνεύματι &amp;c.  <em class="underline">Ye erre</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">not knowing <a id="l1349"></a>the scriptures nor the great mystery of godlinesse, that is <a id="l1350"></a>Christ, who was manifested in the flesh, justified in the <a id="l1351"></a>spirit</em>.  By this citation its plain that he read Ὃ,  using one of those MSS which by understanding Χριστὸν for μυστήριον  turned Ὃ into ὃς, &amp; by way of interpretation <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>insert<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ing  τουτέστι Χριστὸν which in those MSS was to be understood: <a id="l1353"></a>unless you will say that he turned Θεὸς into ὅς, which is very <a id="l1354"></a>hard.  For had Θεὸς been in his text he would not <a id="l1355"></a>have said μυστήριον τουτέστι Χριστόν ὃς ἐφανερώθη, <a id="l1356"></a>but  μυστήριον Θεὸς, τουτέστι Χριστὸς, <a id="l1357"></a>ἐφανερώθη, putting Χριστὸς not for μυστήριον but <a id="l1358"></a>for θεὸς.  For Χριστὸς &amp; Θεὸς are more plainly equipollent  then Χριστος &amp; μυστήριον, &amp; in <a id="l1359"></a>making Χριστὸς &amp; μστήριον equipollent he makes <a id="l1360"></a>μυστήριον the nominative case to εφανερώθη &amp; <a id="l1361"></a>therefore reads them joyned in his text by the article <a id="l1362"></a>ὃς.  Had he read Θεὸς he would never have left out <a id="l1363"></a>that  authentic &amp; demonstrative word &amp; by way of <a id="l1364"></a>interpretation for μυτήριον θεὸς written Χριστόν ὃς; <a id="l1365"></a>for this was not to argue against Nestorius but to <a id="l1366"></a> spoile the argument which lay before him.  Neither <a id="l1367"></a>would he have gone on as he does within a few lines <a id="l1368"></a>after to recite the same text, putting λογὸς by way of interpretation for μστήριόν &amp; to propound it as his bare opinion that the Word or <a id="l1369"></a>son of God was here to be understood by this mystery, <a id="l1370"></a>&amp; to dispute for this his opinion (as needing proof) out of other texts <a id="l1371"></a>of scripture, as he does after this manner.<sup class="note" id="n42-ref">[42]</sup> <em class="underline">More<a id="l1372"></a>over</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">in my opinion</em>, <em class="underline">that mystery of godlines  is nothing  else then  he that came to us from  the Father, the  Word, who was manifested in the flesh.  <a id="l1375"></a>ffor in taking the form of a servant, he was born <a id="l1376"></a>of the holy God-bearing Virgin</em> &amp;c.  And then after <a id="l1377"></a>many other things he at length in sect 23 &amp; 24 concludes that <em class="underline">this divine <a id="l1378"></a>mystery is above our understanding, &amp; that the only begotten</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p032r"> &lt;32r&gt; </span>
<em class="underline">who is God &amp; according to the scriptures the Lord of all <a id="l1379"></a>things, appeared to us was seen on earth &amp; became a <a id="l1380"></a>man</em>.  This he makes not the text it self, but the interpretation thereof &amp; from the  preceding disputation concludes it to be genuine.   <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 32v &gt; </span>And all this is further confirmed by Photius who in his Commentary <a id="l1381"></a><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>upon<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the Epistles (not yet published) relates that Cyril in the 12 chapt <a id="l1382"></a>of his Scholiums, read ὃς ἐφανερώθη &amp;c.  And consonant to this reading <a id="l1383"></a>is Cyrills commentary upon the text in his explanation of the second of <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> twelve anathematas, <a id="l1384"></a>where he puts the question Quid est igitur quod dicit.

Whereas had Θεὸς been in the text <a id="l1387"></a>it would have needed no  interpretation, nor would he have put λογὸς for <a id="l1388"></a>θεὸς in order to prove that God was manifested in the flesh.]</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 32r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par46">Again in the first of his two treatises de fide ad <a id="l1389"></a>Reginas neare the end he cites the text &amp; argues thus <a id="l1390"></a> against the interpretation of Nestorius.  <em class="underline">Who is <a id="l1391"></a>it</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">that is manifested in the flesh?  Is it not <a id="l1392"></a>fully evident that it is the Word of God the ffather?  <a id="l1393"></a>ffor so will that be a great mystery of godliness</em> [<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n43-ref">[43]</sup> which <a id="l1394"></a>was] <em class="underline">manifested in the flesh.  He was seen of Angels <a id="l1395"></a>ascending into heaven: he was preached to the Gen<a id="l1396"></a>tiles by the holy Apostles: he was believed on in the <a id="l1397"></a>world: but this not as a mere man but as God born <a id="l1398"></a>in the flesh &amp; after our manner</em>.</p>
<p id="par47">So also in his second book de fide ad Reginas, sect. <a id="l1399"></a>33 he cites the place again &amp; then argues upon it against <a id="l1400"></a>the opinion of Nestorius after this manner.  <em class="underline">If the Word <a id="l1401"></a>being God be said to become a man &amp; yet continue <a id="l1402"></a>what he was before without losing his Deity, the <a id="l1403"></a>mystery of godlinesse is without doubt a very great one: <a id="l1404"></a>but if Christ be a  mere man joyned with God only <a id="l1405"></a>in the parity of dignity &amp; power (for this is maintained <a id="l1406"></a>by some unlearned men) how is he manifested in the <a id="l1407"></a>flesh?  Is it not plain that every man is in the flesh <a id="l1408"></a>&amp; cannot otherwise bee seen by any body?  How then <a id="l1409"></a>was he said to be seen of the holy Angels?  For do <a id="l1410"></a>they not also see us?  What was there therefore <a id="l1411"></a>new or extraordinary in Christ if the Angels saw <a id="l1412"></a>him such a man as we are &amp; nothing more?</em> &amp;c  <a id="l1413"></a>Thus Cyril goes on to give his reasons why that which <a id="l1414"></a>was manifested in the flesh was not a mere created <a id="l1415"></a>man, as Nestorius interpreted but the eternal Word <a id="l1416"></a>or Son of God: all which would have been very super<a id="l1417"></a>fluous &amp; impertinent if God had then been expresly <a id="l1418"></a>in the Text.</p>
<p id="par48">Seing therefore Nestorius alleged the text to <a id="l1419"></a>prove that it was a created thing which was manifested in <a id="l1420"></a>the flesh, &amp; Cyril in confuting him did not answer that <a id="l1421"></a>it was God expresly in the text nor raise any debate a<a id="l1422"></a>bout the reading, but only put another interpretation <a id="l1423"></a>upon the text then Nestorius had done: arguing with <a id="l1424"></a>Cassian that in the text it was not a mere man as <a id="l1425"></a>Nestorius contended, but  the great mystery of godliness, &amp; <a id="l1426"></a>by consequence Christ or God, the Son, which was manifested in <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p033r"> &lt;33r&gt; </span> the flesh, &amp; labouring by divers other arguments to <a id="l1427"></a>prove this interpretation: its evident beyond all cavil <a id="l1428"></a>that Cyril was a stranger to θεὸς now got into the text <a id="l1429"></a>&amp; read ὃ or ὃς as Nestorius &amp; Cassian did.</p>
<p id="par49">And yet in  his books ad Reginas &amp; his other writings, wherever <a id="l1430"></a>he quotes this text the Greeks have since corrected  <a id="l1431"></a>it by their corrected MSS of S.

<p id="par51">Yet whilst the Nestorian controversy brought the <a id="l1454"></a>text into play, &amp; the two parties ran the interpretation <a id="l1455"></a>into extremes, the one disputing that ὃ or ὃς was a crea<a id="l1456"></a>ture, the other that it was the word of God: the pre<a id="l1457"></a>valence of the latter party made it passe for the ortho<a id="l1458"></a>dox opinion that ὃ or ὃς was God, &amp; so gave occasion to the <a id="l1459"></a>Greeks henceforward to change the language of <em class="underline">Christ</em> <a id="l1460"></a>into that of <em class="underline">God</em>, &amp; say in their  expositions <a id="l1461"></a>of the text that God was manifested in the flesh (as I <a id="l1462"></a>find Theodoret doth,) &amp; at length to write God in <a id="l1463"></a>the text it self, the easy change of Ο or ΟΣ into ΘΣ inviting <a id="l1464"></a>them to do it; and after this was become the orthodox <a id="l1465"></a>authentic reading, to set right the text in Chrysostom, <a id="l1466"></a>Cyril, Theodoret &amp; wherever else they found it (in their <a id="l1467"></a>opinion) corrupted by hereticks.</p>
<p id="par52">And the man that first began thus to  alter the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p034r"> &lt;34r&gt; </span> 
sacred text was Macedonius the Patriarch of Constantinople in <a id="l1468"></a>the beginning of the sixt Century.  For the Emperor Anas<a id="l1469"></a>tasius banished him for corrupting it.  At that time the Greek <a id="l1470"></a>Church had been long divided about the Council of Chalcedon; <a id="l1471"></a>many who allowed the condemnation of Eutyches rejecting the <a id="l1472"></a>Councel by reason of its decreeing by the influence of the <a id="l1473"></a>Bishop of Rome's letter against Eutyches, that Christ sub<a id="l1474"></a>sisted not only <em class="underline">ex duabus naturis</em>  which Eutyches allowed <a id="l1475"></a>but also <em class="underline">in duabus naturis</em> which language was new to the <a id="l1476"></a>Greeks &amp; by a great part of that Church taken for <a id="l1477"></a>Nestorianism.  For they understood that as the body &amp; soul <a id="l1478"></a>made the nature of man so God &amp; Man made the nature <a id="l1479"></a>of Christ, assigning a nature to the Person of Christ as <a id="l1480"></a>well as to all other things, &amp; not considering that in all <a id="l1481"></a>compounds the several parts have also their several natures.  <a id="l1482"></a>Hence each party endeavoured to render the other suspected of <a id="l1483"></a>heresy, as if they that were for the Council secretly favoured <a id="l1484"></a>the Nestorians &amp; they that were against it the Eutychians.  <a id="l1485"></a>ffor one party in maintaining two distinct natures in Christ <a id="l1486"></a>were thought to deny the nature of one person with Nestorius, <a id="l1487"></a>&amp; the other party in opposing two distinct natures in him <a id="l1488"></a>were thought to deny the truth of one of the natures with <a id="l1489"></a>Eutyches.  Both parties therefore to cleare themselves of those im<a id="l1490"></a>putations anathematized both those heresies &amp; therefore whilst <a id="l1491"></a>they thus differed in their modes of speaking they agreed in their <a id="l1492"></a>sence as Evagrius well observes.  But the Bishops of Rome &amp; <a id="l1493"></a>Alexandria being engaged against one another &amp; for a long <a id="l1494"></a>time distracting the East by these disputes: at length the Empe<a id="l1495"></a>ror Zeno to quiet his Empire &amp; perhaps to secure it from <a id="l1496"></a>the encroachment of the Bishop of Rome <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n45-ref">[45]</sup> who by this verbal contest <a id="l1497"></a>aspired to the name &amp; authority of  universal Bishop, sent <a id="l1498"></a>about an Henoticum or pacificatory Decree wherein he ana<a id="l1499"></a>thematized both Nestorius &amp; Eutyches with their followers <a id="l1500"></a>on the one hand &amp; abrogated the Popes letter &amp; the Councell <a id="l1501"></a>on the other: &amp; his successor Anastasius for the same <a id="l1502"></a>end laboured to have this Decree signed by all the Bishops.  <a id="l1503"></a>And Macedonius  at first subscribed it, but <a id="l1504"></a>afterwards heading those who stood up for the Councel, <a id="l1505"></a><sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n46-ref">[46]</sup> was for  corrupting the scriptures in favour of his opinion &amp; such other <a id="l1506"></a>things as were laid to his charge deposed &amp; <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n47-ref">[47]</sup> banished A.C. 512.  <a id="l1507"></a>But his own party (which at length prevailed) defended him as if <a id="l1508"></a>opprest by calumnies &amp; so received that reading for genuine which <a id="l1509"></a>he had put about among them.

<p id="par53">But now I have told you the original of the corruption I <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p035r"> &lt;35r&gt; </span> must tell you my Author, &amp; he is Liberatus Archdeacon <a id="l1517"></a>of the Church of Carthage who lived in that very age.

<p id="par54">But whilst he is said to be banished as a Nestorian <a id="l1571"></a>for this, without explaining what is there meant by a Nest<a id="l1572"></a>orian, it looks like a trickish way of speaking used by his <a id="l1573"></a>friends  to ridicule the proceedings against <a id="l1574"></a>him as inconsistent, &amp; perhaps to invert the crime of falsa<a id="l1575"></a>tion as if a Nestorian would rather change ΘΣ into Ο.  <a id="l1576"></a>For they that read history with judgment will too often <a id="l1577"></a>meet with such trickish reports &amp; even in the very story <a id="l1578"></a>of Macedonius I meet with some other reports of the <a id="l1579"></a>same kind.  For Macedonius having in his keeping the <a id="l1580"></a>original Acts of the Council of Chalcedon signed by that <a id="l1581"></a>Emperor under whom it was called &amp; refusing to deli<a id="l1582"></a>ver this book to the Emperor Anastasius: some to make <a id="l1583"></a>this Emperor perjured distorted the story as if at his <a id="l1584"></a>coming to the crown he had promised under his hand <a id="l1585"></a>&amp; oath that he would not act against the Council of <a id="l1586"></a>Chalcedon,  &amp; represented his subscribed promise to be the <a id="l1587"></a>book which Macedonius refused to deliver back to him.  Mace<a id="l1588"></a>donius had got his Bishopric by being against the Council <a id="l1589"></a>of Chalcedon, &amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n52-ref">[52]</sup> had subscribed the Henoticum of Zeno in <a id="l1590"></a>which that Council was anathematized: &amp; this being objected <a id="l1591"></a>against him, his friends to stifle the accusation make a con<a id="l1592"></a>trary story of the Emperor as if when he came to the <a id="l1593"></a>crown he had done as much in behalf of the Council.  <a id="l1594"></a># Another &amp; &amp;<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 35v &gt; </span> # Another report was <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> that the people of Alexandria &amp; all Egypt <a id="l1595"></a>great &amp; small, free &amp; bond, Priests &amp; Monks excepting only strang<a id="l1596"></a>ers, became about this time possessed with evil spirits &amp; being <a id="l1597"></a>deprived of humane speech barked day &amp; night like doggs so <a id="l1598"></a>that they were afterward bound with iron chains &amp; drawn <a id="l1599"></a>to church that they might recover their health.

Again we are told in <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n54-ref">[54]</sup> history that the adversaries of Ma<a id="l1604"></a>cedonius produced certain boys in judgment to accuse <a id="l1605"></a>both him &amp; themselves of Sodomy: but when they found <a id="l1606"></a>his genitals were cut off, they betook themselves to other <a id="l1607"></a>arts for deposing him.  If you can beleive that an Eu<a id="l1608"></a>nuch had the beard &amp; voice of another man &amp; that <a id="l1609"></a>in a solemn Council the great Patriarch of the East <a id="l1610"></a>was thus accused &amp; thus acquitted &amp; yet deposed: you must <a id="l1611"></a>acknowledge that there were many Bishops among the <a id="l1612"></a>Greeks who would not stick at as ill &amp; shamelesse things <a id="l1613"></a>as corrupting the scriptures.

Whence I think it will <a id="l1650"></a>easily be granted that he was condemned as a falsary by the <a id="l1651"></a>greatest part of the eastern Empire &amp; by consequence that <a id="l1652"></a>the genuine reading was till then by the Churches of that Empire <a id="l1653"></a>accounted ὃ.

<p id="par58">So then the falsation was set on foot in the beginning <a id="l1686"></a>of the sixt Century &amp; is now of about 1200 years standing <a id="l1687"></a>&amp; therefore since it lay but in a lettter &amp; so was more easily <a id="l1688"></a>spread in the greek MSS then the testimony of the three in <a id="l1689"></a>heaven in the Latine ones, we need not wonder if the old <a id="l1690"></a>reading be scarce to be met with in any greek MSS now <a id="l1691"></a>extant: &amp; yet it is in some.  For thô Beza tells  us <a id="l1692"></a>that all the greek MSS read Θεὸς yet I must tell Beza's <a id="l1693"></a>Readers that all his MSS read ὃ.  For he had no other MSS <a id="l1694"></a>on the Epistles besides the Claromontan, &amp; in this MS, as <a id="l1695"></a>Morinus by ocular inspection <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n57-ref">[57]</sup> has since informed us, the an<a id="l1696"></a>cient reading was Ο, but yet in another hand &amp; with <a id="l1697"></a>other ink, the letter Θ has been written out of the line <a id="l1698"></a>&amp; the letter Ο thickened to make a Σ appear.  Which <a id="l1699"></a>instance shews sufficiently by whom the ancient reading <a id="l1700"></a>has been changed.  Velesius also read ὃ in one of the <a id="l1701"></a>Spanish MSS, &amp; so did the author of the Oxford edition <a id="l1702"></a>of the new Testament A.C. 1675 in the MS of Lincoln <a id="l1703"></a>College library which is the oldest of the Oxford MSS.  The <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n58-ref">[58]</sup> Alexandria MS &amp; one of Colberts &amp; Cyril c. 12 scholiorum (teste Photio MS com. in epistolas) read ΟΣ.  So <a id="l1710"></a>then there are some ancient greek MSS which read ὃ &amp; others ος: but I do <a id="l1711"></a>not hear of any Latine ones either ancient or modern <a id="l1712"></a>which read Θεὸς.</p>
<p id="par59">And besides to read Θεὸς makes the sense obscure &amp; difficult.  <a id="l1713"></a>For how can it properly be said that God was  justified in the spirit?  But to read ὃ, &amp; interpret <a id="l1715"></a>it of Christ as the ancient Christians did without restraining <a id="l1716"></a>it to his divinity, makes the sense very easy.  For the pro<a id="l1717"></a>mised &amp; long expected Messias, the hope of Israel is to us <a id="l1718"></a>the great mystery of godlinesse, &amp; this mystery was at length mani<a id="l1719"></a>fested to the  Iews from the time of his baptism, &amp; justified to be the person <a id="l1720"></a>whom they expected.</p>
<p id="par60">I have now given you an account of the corruption <a id="l1721"></a>of the text, the summ of which is this.  The difference between <a id="l1722"></a>the greek &amp; the ancient Versions puts it past dispute that <a id="l1723"></a>either the Greeks have corrupted their MSS or the Latines <a id="l1724"></a>Syrians &amp; Ethiopians their Versions, &amp; it's more reason<a id="l1725"></a>able to lay the fault upon the Greeks then upon the <a id="l1726"></a>other three for these considerations.  It was easier for <a id="l1727"></a>one nation to do it then for three to conspire.  It was <a id="l1728"></a>easier to change a letter or two in the Greek then <a id="l1729"></a>six words in the latine.  In the Greek the sense is <a id="l1730"></a>obscure in the Versions clear.  It was agreable to the in<a id="l1731"></a>terest of the Greeks to make the change but against the <a id="l1732"></a>interest of the three nations to do it, &amp; men are never false <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p039r"> &lt;39r&gt; </span> to their interests.  The greek reading was unknown in the times <a id="l1733"></a>of the Arian controversy, but that of the Versions  then in use amongst both Greeks &amp; Latines.  Some <a id="l1734"></a>greek MSS render the greek reading dubious: but those of the Versi<a id="l1735"></a>ons hitherto collated agree.  There are no signes of corruption <a id="l1736"></a>in the Versions hitherto discovered but in the Greek we have <a id="l1737"></a>shewed you particularly when, on what occasion &amp; by whome <a id="l1738"></a>the text was corrupted.</p>
<p id="par61">I know not whether it be worth the while to tell <a id="l1739"></a>you that in the printed works of Athanasius there is an <a id="l1740"></a>Epistle De incarnatione Verbi which reads Θεὸς.  For this <a id="l1741"></a>Epistle relates to the Nestorian heresy &amp; so was written <a id="l1742"></a>by a much later author then Athanasius, &amp; may also <a id="l1743"></a>possibly have been since corrected (like the works of <a id="l1744"></a>Chrysostom &amp; Cyril) by the corrected text of S. Paul's <a id="l1745"></a>Epistles.  I have had so short a time to run my eye over <a id="l1746"></a>Authors, that I cannot tell whether upon further search, <a id="l1747"></a>more passages about this falsation may not  hereafter <a id="l1748"></a>occur pertinent to the argument.  But if there should <a id="l1749"></a>I presume it will not be difficult now the falsation is <a id="l1750"></a>thus far laid open, to know what construction to put <a id="l1751"></a>upon them &amp; how to apply them.</p>
<p id="par62">You see what freedome I have used in this discourse, <a id="l1752"></a>&amp; I hope you will interpret it candidly.  ffor if the an<a id="l1753"></a>cient Churches in debating &amp; deciding the greatest myste<a id="l1754"></a>ries of religion, knew nothing of these two texts: I <a id="l1755"></a>understand not why we should be so fond of them <a id="l1756"></a>now the debates are over.  And whilst it's the character <a id="l1757"></a>of an honest man to be pleased, &amp; of a man of interest <a id="l1758"></a>to be troubled at the detection of frauds, &amp; of both to <a id="l1759"></a>run most into those passions when the detection is made <a id="l1760"></a>plainest: I hope this letter will to one of your inte<a id="l1761"></a>grity prove so much the more acceptable, as it makes <a id="l1762"></a>a further discovery then you have hitherto met with <a id="l1763"></a>in Commentators.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p040r"> &lt;40r&gt; </span>
<p id="par63">After the fourth Paragraph ending with these words – <a id="l1764"></a>–––[<em class="underline">in order to prove them one God</em>,] add this Paragraph<br><br></p>
<p id="par64">These passages in Cyprian may receive further <a id="l1766"></a>light by a like passage in Tertullian, from whence <a id="l1767"></a>Cyprian seems to have borrowed them.  For tis well <a id="l1768"></a>known that Cyprian (tho otherwise a  prudent man) was a great admirer of Ter<a id="l1769"></a>tullians writings &amp; read them frequently, calling Tertulli<a id="l1770"></a>an his Master.  The passage is this.  <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n59-ref">[59]</sup> <em class="underline">The connexion <a id="l1771"></a>of the Father in the Son &amp; of the Son in the Pa<a id="l1772"></a>raclete makes three cohering one from another, <a id="l1773"></a>which three are one (one  thing, not <a id="l1774"></a>one person:) as it is said, I &amp; the Father are <a id="l1775"></a>one; denoting the unity of substance, not the singula<a id="l1776"></a>rity of number</em>.  Here you see Tertullian says not <a id="l1777"></a>the father word &amp; holy spirit as the text now <a id="l1778"></a>has it, but the Father Son &amp; Paraclete, nor cites <a id="l1779"></a>any thing more of the text then these words; <a id="l1780"></a><em class="underline">which three are one</em>.  Tho this his  treatise against Praxeas be wholy spent in discoursing about the Trinity &amp; all texts of scripture are cited  to prove it, &amp; this text of Iohn as we now read it would have been one of the most obvious &amp; apposite to have been cited at large, yet Tertullian could find no more words in it for his purpose then <em class="underline">These three are one</em>.  These therefore he interprets – –  These he interprets of the <a id="l1781"></a>Trinity &amp; enforces the interpretation by that <a id="l1782"></a>other text  <em class="underline">I and the Father are one</em>, <a id="l1783"></a>as if the phrase was of the same importance <a id="l1784"></a>in both places.  So then this interpretation seems <a id="l1785"></a>to have been invented by the Montanists for giving <a id="l1786"></a>countenance to their Trinity.  ffor Tertullian was a <a id="l1787"></a>Montanist when he wrote this: &amp; its most likely <a id="l1788"></a>that so corrupt &amp; forct an interpretation had it's rise <a id="l1789"></a>amongst  a sect of men accustomed to make bold with the scriptures.  Cyprian  being  used to it <a id="l1790"></a>in his Master's writings,  it seems from thence to have dropt into his.  For this may be gathered  from the likeness between their <a id="l1792"></a>citations.  And by the disciples of these two great men <a id="l1793"></a>it seems to have been propagated amongst those <a id="l1794"></a>many Latines who (as Eucherius tells us) received <a id="l1795"></a>it in the next age, understanding the Trinity <a id="l1796"></a>by the spirit, water &amp; blood.  For how  without the countenance of some such author an in<a id="l1797"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p041r"> &lt;41r&gt; </span>terpretation so corrupt &amp; strained should come to be <a id="l1798"></a>received in that age so generally, I do not under<a id="l1799"></a>stand.<br><br></p>
