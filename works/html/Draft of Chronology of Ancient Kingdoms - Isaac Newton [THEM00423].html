<p id="par23">The Trojan war was one generation later then that Expedition. , 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013r"> &lt;13r&gt; </span> several captains of the Greeks in that war being  sons of the Argonauts. <a id="l444"></a>And the ancient Greeks recconed Memnon or Amenophis king of Egypt, <a id="l445"></a>to have reigned in the times of that war, feigning him to be the son <a id="l446"></a>of Tithonus the elder brother of Priam, &amp; in the end of that war to <a id="l447"></a>have come from Susa to the assistance of Priam. Amenophis was <a id="l448"></a>therefore of the same age with the elder children of Priam. In the <a id="l449"></a>opinion of the ancient Greeks he was with his army at Susa in the <a id="l450"></a>last year of the Trojan war; &amp; after that he might return <a id="l451"></a>into Egypt &amp; adorn it with building,s &amp; Obelisks &amp; Statues, &amp; dye there <a id="l452"></a>about 90 or 95 years after the death of Solomon when he had deter<a id="l453"></a>mined &amp; setled the the beginning of the new Egyptian year of 365 days upon <a id="l454"></a>the Vernal Equinox, so as to deserve the monument above mentioned in <a id="l455"></a>memory thereof. </p>
<p id="par24">Thus by the consent of two arguments taken from Astronomy, the <a id="l456"></a>one taken from the Precession of the Equinox, the other from the Æra <a id="l457"></a>of the Theban year of the Egyptians, it appears that the Argonautic <a id="l458"></a>Expedition was about 40 or 45 years later then the death of Solomon, <a id="l459"></a>&amp; the last year of  the Trojan war about 75 years <a id="l460"></a>later then his death, &amp; the death of Amenophis or Memnon, ac<a id="l461"></a>cording to the date of his sepulchral monument, about 90 or 95 <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>years<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l462"></a>later then Solomon's.

<p id="par25">The Europeans had no Chronology before the times of the Persian <a id="l467"></a>Monarchy. And whatever Chronology they have of ancienter times hath <a id="l468"></a>been framed since by reasoning &amp; conjecture.

Plutarch <a id="l473"></a>tells <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> us that the Philosophers anciently delivered their opinions in verse <a id="l474"></a>as Orpheus, Hesiod, Parmenides, Xenophanes, Empedocles, Thales, but <a id="l475"></a>afterwards left of the use of verses, &amp; that Aristarchus, Timocharis, <a id="l476"></a>Aristillus, Hipparchus, did not make Astronomy the more contemptible <a id="l477"></a>by describing it in prose after Eudoxus Hesiod &amp; Thales had wrote of it <a id="l478"></a>in verse. Solon wrote <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n36-ref">[36]</sup> in verse, &amp; all the seven wise men were addicted <a id="l479"></a>to poetry, as Anaximenes <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n37-ref">[37]</sup> affirmed. Till those days the Greeks wrote <a id="l480"></a>only in verse, &amp; while they did so there could be no Chronology, nor <a id="l481"></a>any other history then such as was mixed with poetical fancies. <a id="l482"></a>Pliny <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup> in recconing up the inventors of things, tells us that Pherecides <a id="l483"></a>Syrius taught to compose discourses in prose in the reign of Cyrus,<a id="l484"></a>&amp; Cadmus Milesius to write history.

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> digested their's by those of the Archons of Athens, or kings of the <a id="l501"></a>Lacedemonians.

He lived in the 105<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, &amp; was derided by Plato for his <a id="l504"></a>ignorance. This Breviary seems to have conteined nothing more <a id="l505"></a>then a short account of the Victors in every Olympiad. Then <a id="l506"></a>Ephorus <sup>l</sup><sup class="note" id="n45-ref">[45]</sup> the disciple of Isocrates formed a chronological history <a id="l507"></a>of Greece, beginning with the return of the Heraclides into Polopon<a id="l508"></a>nesus, &amp; ending with the siege of Perinthus in the twentith year of <a id="l509"></a> Philip the father of Alexander the great, that is, eleven years <a id="l510"></a>before the fall of the Persian Empire. But <sup>m</sup><sup class="note" id="n46-ref">[46]</sup> he digested things by <a id="l511"></a>generations: &amp; the recconing by the Olympiads, or by any other Æra <a id="l512"></a>was not yet in use among the Greeks. The Arundelian Marbles <a id="l513"></a>were composed sixty years after the dath of Alexander the greatn<a id="l514"></a>(An. 4.

And in the <a id="l517"></a>next Olympiad Timæus Siculus improved it. For he wrote a history <a id="l518"></a>in several books down to his own times according to the Olympiads, <a id="l519"></a>comparing the Ephori, the kings of Sparta, the Archons of Athens, <a id="l520"></a>&amp; the Priestesses of Argos with the Olympic <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>v<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ictors, so as to make <a id="l521"></a>the Olympiads, &amp; the Genealogies &amp; successions of kings and Priestesses, <a id="l522"></a>&amp; <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>Poetical histories, suit with one another according to the best of <a id="l523"></a>his judgement. And where he left off, Polybius began &amp; carryed <a id="l524"></a> on the history. <span class="hspac-n" title="1 character space left blank.">&nbsp;</span> Eratosthenes wrote above an hundred years after <a id="l525"></a>the death of Alexander the great. He was followed by Apollodorus, <a id="l526"></a>&amp; these two have been followe ever since by Chronologers. </p>
<p id="par26">But how uncertain their Chronology is, &amp; how doubtfull it was <a id="l527"></a>reputed by the Greeks of those times, may be understood by these <a id="l528"></a>passages of Plutarch. <em class="underline">Some reccon Lycurgus</em>, saith <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n47-ref">[47]</sup> he, <em class="underline">contem<a id="l529"></a>porary to Iphitus, &amp; to have been his companion in ordering the <a id="l530"></a>Olympic festivals, amongst whom was Aristotel the Philosopher; <a id="l531"></a>arguing from the Olympic Disk which had the name of Lycurgus <a id="l532"></a>upon it. Others supputing the times by the succession of the <a id="l533"></a>kings of Lacedæmon, as Eratosthenes &amp; Apollodorus, affirm <a id="l534"></a>that he was not a few years older then the first Olympiad. </em>He <a id="l535"></a>began to flourish in the 16<sup>th</sup> or 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, &amp; at length Aris<a id="l536"></a>totel made him as old as the first Olympiad, &amp; then Eratosthenes <a id="l537"></a>Apollodorus &amp; their followers made him above an hundred years <a id="l538"></a>older. And in another place Plutarch <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n48-ref">[48]</sup> tells us: <em class="underline">The congress of <a id="l539"></a>Solon with Crœsus some think they can confute by Chronology. <a id="l540"></a>But a history so illustrious &amp; verified by so many witnesses, &amp; <a id="l541"></a>which is more, so agreeable to the manners of Solon, &amp; worthy <a id="l542"></a>of the greatness of his mind, &amp; of his wisdom, I cannot perswade <a id="l543"></a>my <span class="hspac-n" title="1 character space left blank.">&nbsp;</span>self to reject because <span class="hspac-n" title="1 character space left blank.">&nbsp;</span>of some chronological Canons,as <a id="l544"></a>they <span class="hspac-n" title="1 character space left blank.">&nbsp;</span>call them, which hundreds <span class="hspac-n" title="1 character space left blank.">&nbsp;</span>of authors correcting have not <a id="l545"></a>yet been able to constitute any thing certain, in which they could <a id="l546"></a>agree <span class="hspac-n" title="1 character space left blank.">&nbsp;</span>amongst themselves about repugnances. </em></p>
<p id="par27">And as for the Chronology of the Latines that is still more <a id="l547"></a>uncertain.

<p id="par28">Diodorus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> in the beginning of his History tells us that he <a id="l563"></a>did not define by any certain space the times preceding the <a id="l564"></a>Trojan war, because he had no certain foundation to rely upon: <a id="l565"></a>but from the Trojan war, according to the recconing of Apollodo<a id="l566"></a>rus, Atheniensis whom he followed, there were eighty years to the return <a id="l567"></a>of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus: &amp; that from that period to <a id="l568"></a>the first Olympiad there were three hundred &amp; twenty eight <a id="l569"></a>years, computing the times from the kings of the Lacedemonians. <a id="l570"></a>Apollodorus followed Eratosthenes &amp; both of them followed Thu<a id="l571"></a>cydides, in recconing eighty years <a id="l572"></a>from the Trojan war to the return of the Heraclides. But <a id="l573"></a>in recconing 328 years from that return to the first Olympiad, <a id="l574"></a>the Chronologers only computed the times by the successions of the <a id="l575"></a>kings of Lacedæmon, as <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n54-ref">[54]</sup> Plutarch also affirms; &amp; therein they have <a id="l576"></a>been ever since followed by later Chronologers.

<p id="par41">Lycurgus published his laws in the reign of Agesilaus the son <a id="l870"></a>&amp; successor of Dorissus in the other race of the kings of Sparta.

And when the Ele<a id="l892"></a>ans were thus consecrated, Oxylus  <a id="l893"></a>restored the Olympic games.

And by this recconing the return <a id="l899"></a>of the Heraclides into Peloponesus will be two generations by <a id="l900"></a>the eldest sons (or about 54 years) before the Olympiads as above. </p>

Thucydides tells us further <a id="l1003"></a>that the first colony which the Greeks sent into Sicily, came from Chalcis <a id="l1004"></a>in Eubœa under the conduct of Thucles, &amp; built Naxus, &amp; the next <a id="l1005"></a>year Archias came from Corinth with a Colony &amp; built Syracuse, <a id="l1006"></a>, &amp; that Lami came about the same time into Sicily with a colony from <a id="l1007"></a>Megara in Achaia, &amp; lived first at Trotilum &amp; then at Leontini, &amp; died <a id="l1008"></a>at Thapsus neare Syracuse; &amp; that after his death this Colony was <a id="l1009"></a>invited by Hyblo to Megara in Sicily, &amp; lived there 245 years, &amp; was <a id="l1010"></a>then expelled by Gelo king of Sicily. Now Gelo flourished about 78 <a id="l1011"></a>years before the end of the Peloponesian warr. Count backwards the 78 &amp; the 245 years &amp; about 12 years more for the reign of Lamis <a id="l1012"></a>in Sicily, &amp; the recconing will place the building of Syracuse <a id="l1013"></a>about 335 years before the end of the Peloponesian war, or in the <a id="l1014"></a>10<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. And there about Eusebius &amp; others place it. And the <a id="l1015"></a>first building of Triremes whereby Colonies might be sent abroad <a id="l1016"></a>without danger of Pyrates, which till those days infested the Greek seas,  
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023r"> &lt;23r&gt; </span> might be ten or twenty years earlier. From the colonies hencefor<a id="l1017"></a>ward sent into Italy &amp; Sicily came the name of <em class="underline">Græcia Magna</em>. </p>
<p id="par47">Thucydides <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n84-ref">[84]</sup> tells us further that the Greeks began to come into <a id="l1018"></a>Sicily almost three hundred years after the Siculi had invaded that <a id="l1019"></a>island with an army out of Italy. And therefore that invasion was <a id="l1020"></a>almost 631 years before the end of the Peloponnesian war, that is, <a id="l1021"></a>almost as early as the 27<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign. Whence it may <a id="l1022"></a>be placed in the reign of Solomon. Hellanicus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n85-ref">[85]</sup> tells us that it <a id="l1023"></a>was in the third generation before the Trojan war, &amp; in the 26<sup>th</sup> <a id="l1024"></a>year of the priesthood of Alcione priestess of Iuno Argiva: and <a id="l1025"></a>Philistius of Syracuse that it was 80 years before the Trojan war. <a id="l1026"></a>Whence it follows that the Trojan war &amp; Argonautic expedition <a id="l1027"></a>were later then the days of Solomon &amp; Rehoboam. </p>
<p id="par48">Dionysius Halycarnassæus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n86-ref">[86]</sup> tells us that in the time of the Tro<a id="l1028"></a>jan war Latinus was king of the Aborigines in Italy, &amp; that in <a id="l1029"></a>the sixteenth age after that war, Romulus built Rome. By ages <a id="l1030"></a>he means reigns of kings. For after Latinus he names sixteen <a id="l1031"></a>kings of the Latins, the last of which was Numitor in whose <a id="l1032"></a>days Romulus built Rome. For Romulus was contemporary to <a id="l1033"></a>Numitor. And after him Dionysius reccons six kings more over <a id="l1034"></a>Rome to the beginning of the Consuls. Now these twenty &amp; two <a id="l1035"></a>kings (if there were so many) at about 18 years to a reign <a id="l1036"></a>one with another (for many of them were slain) reigned 396 <a id="l1037"></a>years, which counted back from the Consulship of Iunius Brutus &amp; <a id="l1038"></a>Valerius Publicola (the two first Consuls,) place the coming of ~ <a id="l1039"></a>Æneas from Italy into Troy about 78 years after the death of <a id="l1040"></a>Solomon. And by this recconing th taking of Troy will be about <a id="l1041"></a>70 or 75 years after the death of Solomon as above, &amp; Æneas ~ <a id="l1042"></a>will be contemporary to Pygmaleon &amp; Dido as Virgil affirms, &amp; <a id="l1043"></a>Rome will be built about the 36<sup>th</sup> or 37<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. </p>
<p id="par49">When the Greeks &amp; Latines were forming their technical <a id="l1044"></a>chronology, there were great disputes about the antiquity of Rome. <a id="l1045"></a>The Greeks made it much older then the Olympiads. Some of them said <a id="l1046"></a>it was built by Æneas others by Romus the son or grandson of Æneas, others <a id="l1047"></a>by Romus the son or grandson of Latinus king of the Aborigenes, others by <a id="l1048"></a>Romus the son of Vlysses or of Ascanius or Italus. And some of the Latines <a id="l1049"></a>at first fell in with the opinion of the Greeks, saying that it was built <a id="l1050"></a>by Romulus the son or grandson of Æneas. Timæus Siculus made it <a id="l1051"></a>built about the same time with Carthage. Ennius the poet who flou<a id="l1052"></a>rished about 120 years after the death of Alexander the great, re<a id="l1053"></a>presented it built by  Romulus the grandson of Æneas above an <a id="l1054"></a>hundred years before the Olympiads. And so did Nævius the poet who <a id="l1055"></a>was twenty years older then Enius &amp; served in the first Punic war, <a id="l1056"></a>&amp; wrote the history of that war. Hitherto nothing certain was agreed <a id="l1057"></a>upon: but about this time they began to say that Rome was built a second <a id="l1058"></a>time by Romulus in the fifteenth age after the destruction of Troy. </p>
<p id="par50" class="i0">By ages they meant reigns of kings &amp; recconed the first fourteen <a id="l1059"></a>ages or reigns at about 432 years, &amp; the following reigns of the <a id="l1060"></a>seven kings of Rome at 244 years more: both which numbers <a id="l1061"></a>made up the time of about 676 years from the taking of Troy <a id="l1062"></a>to the Regifuge according to these Chronologers, but are much too <a id="l1063"></a>long for the course of nature. And by this recconing they placed <a id="l1064"></a>the building of Rome upon the sixt or seventh Olympiad: whereas <a id="l1065"></a>by recconing the reigns of kings at 18 or 20 years a <a id="l1066"></a>piece one with another (which is according to the course of nature) <a id="l1067"></a>&amp; dating the recconing from the true time of the taking of Troy, the <a id="l1068"></a>building of this city would have fallen upon the 36<sup>th</sup> or 37<sup>th</sup> Olympiad <a id="l1069"></a>where I place it. But the Romans having no historian during the <a id="l1070"></a>first four hundred years of their city, &amp; their records being burnt <a id="l1071"></a>by the Gauls 64 years before the death of Alexander the great, 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024r"> &lt;24r&gt; </span> I forbear to meddle with their originals any further. </p>
<p id="par51">I have now carried up the Chronology of Greece as high as <a id="l1072"></a>to the Trojan war &amp; by arguments taken from Astronomy &amp; <a id="l1073"></a>from the course of nature &amp; from that of generations, shewn the old <a id="l1074"></a>recconing to be impossible, &amp; settled a new one, I think without <a id="l1075"></a>the error of one generation. For the Greeks before the times of the <a id="l1076"></a>Persian empire recconed only by generations &amp; by the number of kings reigning: &amp; it is not to be ex<a id="l1077"></a>pected that their records alone can furnish us with any exacter <a id="l1078"></a>sort of recconing. The Hebrews had a chronology by years long <a id="l1079"></a>before the Greeks: &amp; it remains now that I try to settle the Chro<a id="l1080"></a>nology of the Greeks a little better &amp; carry it up a little higher <a id="l1081"></a>by comparing their affairs with those of the Hebrews set down in <a id="l1082"></a>sacred history. </p>
<p id="par52">The expedition of Sesostris was one generation earlier then the <a id="l1083"></a>Argonautic expedition. For in his return back into Egypt he left <a id="l1084"></a>Æetes at Colchos, &amp; Æetes reigned there till the Argonautic expedition; <a id="l1085"></a>&amp; Prometheus was left by Sesostris with a body of men at mount <a id="l1086"></a>Caucasus to guard that pass, &amp; after thirty years released by Hercules <a id="l1087"></a>the Argonaut. And Phlias the son of the great Bacchus (so the poets call Sesostris) <a id="l1088"></a>&amp; of Ariadne the daughter of Minos, was an Argonaute. At the return <a id="l1089"></a>of Sesostris into Egypt, his brother Danaus fled from him into <a id="l1090"></a>Greece with his fifty daughters in a long ship, after the pattern <a id="l1091"></a>of which the ship Argo was built, &amp; Argus the son of Danaus <a id="l1092"></a>was the master builder thereof. And Nauplius the Argonaut <a id="l1093"></a>was born in Greece of Amymone one of the daughters of Danaus &amp; of <a id="l1094"></a>Neptune the Admiral of Sesostris. And two others of the daughters of <a id="l1095"></a>Danaus married Archander &amp; Archilites the sons of Achæus the son <a id="l1096"></a>of Creusa the daughter of Erechtheus king of Athens. And therefore <a id="l1097"></a>the daughters of Danaus were three generations younger then Erechtheus, <a id="l1098"></a>&amp; by consequence contemporary to Theseus the son of Ægeus the adop<a id="l1099"></a>ted son of Pandion the son of Erechtheus. And Theseus in the time of <a id="l1100"></a>the Argonautic expedition was of about 50 or 51 years of age, &amp; so <a id="l1101"></a>was born about the 32<sup>th</sup> year of Solomon. For he stole Helena <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n87-ref">[87]</sup> just before that expedition, being then 50 years old &amp; she but seven, <a id="l1102"></a>or as some say ten. Perithous the son of Ixion helped Theseus to <a id="l1103"></a>steal Helena, &amp; then <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n88-ref">[88]</sup> Theseus went with Perithous to steal Proserpina <a id="l1104"></a>the daughter of Aidoneus &amp; was taken in the action; &amp; whilst he lay <a id="l1105"></a>in prison Castor &amp; Pollux returning from the Argonautic expedition <a id="l1106"></a>released their sister Helena &amp; captivated Æthra the mother of <a id="l1107"></a>Theseus. Now the daughters of Danaus being contemporary to Theseus <a id="l1108"></a>&amp; some of their sons being Argonauts, Danaus with his daughters <a id="l1109"></a>fled from his brother Sesostris into Greece about one generation <a id="l1110"></a>before the Argonautic expedition, &amp; therefore Sesostris returned into <a id="l1111"></a>Ægypt in the reign of Rehoboam, &amp; so was Sesac. For Sesac came <a id="l1112"></a>out of Egypt in the fift year of Rehoboam &amp; <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n89-ref">[89]</sup> spent nine years in <a id="l1113"></a>that expedition against the eastern nations &amp; Greece, &amp; therefore <a id="l1114"></a>returned back into Ægypt in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam. Sesac &amp; <a id="l1115"></a>Sesostris were therefore kings of all Egypt at one &amp; the same time. <a id="l1116"></a>And they agree not only in the time but also in their actions &amp; con<a id="l1117"></a>quests.

Sesostris was otherwise <a id="l1122"></a>called Sesochris, Sesochis, Sesoosis, Sethosis, Sesonchis, Sesonchosis. Take <a id="l1123"></a>away the Greek termination, &amp; the <a id="l1124"></a>names become Sesost, Sesoch, <a id="l1125"></a>Sesoos, Sethos, Sesonch: which names differ very little from Sesach. <a id="l1126"></a>Sesonchis &amp; Sesach differ no more from one another then Memphis &amp; <a id="l1127"></a>Moph, two names of the same city. </p>
<p id="par53">Ægypt was at first divided into many small kingsdoms like other <a id="l1128"></a>nations, &amp; grew into one monarchy by degrees. And the father of Solomons 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025r"> &lt;25r&gt; </span> Queen was the first King of Egypt who came into Phenicia with an <a id="l1129"></a>army. But he only took Gezir &amp; gave it to his daughter. Sesac the next <a id="l1130"></a>king came out of Egypt with an army of Libyans Troglodites &amp; Ethi<a id="l1131"></a>opians (2 Chron. 12. 3) &amp; therefore was then king of all those countries; <a id="l1132"></a>&amp; we do not read in scripture that any former king of Egypt who ~ <a id="l1133"></a>reigned over all those nations, came out of Egypt with a great army <a id="l1134"></a>to conquer other  kingdoms. The sacred history of the Israelites <a id="l1135"></a>from the days of Abraham to the days of Solomon admits of no ~ <a id="l1136"></a>such conqueror. Sesostris reigned over all the same nations of the <a id="l1137"></a>Libyans Troglodites &amp; Ethiopians, &amp; in prophane history we do not read <a id="l1138"></a>of any later king of Egypt who reigned over all those nations &amp; came out of <a id="l1139"></a>Egypt with a great army to conquer other kingdoms. And therefore Sesostris &amp; <a id="l1140"></a>Sesac must be one &amp; the same king of Egypt. This is no new opinion. Iosephus <a id="l1141"></a>discovered it when he affirmed that Herodotus erred in ascribing the actions <a id="l1142"></a>of Sesach to Sesostris &amp; that the error was only in the name of the king. For <a id="l1143"></a>this is as much as to say that the true name of him who did those things <a id="l1144"></a>described by Herodotus was Sesac &amp; that Herodotus erred only in calling him Sesostris, or that <a id="l1145"></a>he was called Sesostris by a corruption of his name. Our great Chro<a id="l1146"></a>nologer Sir Iohn Marsham was also of opinion that Sesostris was Sesac. <a id="l1147"></a>And if this be granted it is then most certain that Sesostris came out of <a id="l1148"></a>Egypt in the fift year of Rehoboam to invade the nations. &amp; returned back <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>into<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Egypt in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of that king, &amp; that Danaus came into <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Greece<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>within a year or two after.

<p id="par54">Rehoboam was born in the last year of king David being 41 <a id="l1155"></a>years old at the death of Solomon (1 King XIV.41.) &amp; therefore his father <a id="l1156"></a>Solomon was born in the 18<sup>th</sup> year of king David's reign or before. And <a id="l1157"></a>two or three years before his birth David besieged Rabbah the metropolis <a id="l1158"></a>of the Ammonites &amp; committed adultery with Bathsheba. And the year <a id="l1159"></a>before this siege began, David vanquished the Ammonites &amp; their ~ <a id="l1160"></a>confederates the Syrians of Zobah &amp; Rehob &amp; Ishtob &amp; Maacah &amp; <a id="l1161"></a>Damascus &amp; extended his dominion over all those nations as far as to <a id="l1162"></a>the entring in of Hamath &amp; the river Euphrates. And before this war be<a id="l1163"></a>gan he smote Moab &amp; Ammon &amp; Edom, &amp; made the Edomites fly, some <a id="l1164"></a>of them into Egypt with their king Hadad then a little child, &amp; others <a id="l1165"></a>to the Philistims where they fortified Azoth against Israel, &amp; to other <a id="l1166"></a>places whether they could escape. And before this he had several battels <a id="l1167"></a>with the Philistims. And all this was after the eighth year of his reign in <a id="l1168"></a>which he came from Hebron to Ierusalem. We cannot err therefore above <a id="l1169"></a> two or three years if we place his victory over Edom in the twelft <a id="l1170"></a>year of his reign &amp; that over Ammon &amp; the Syrians in the fourteenth. <a id="l1171"></a>After the flight of Edom the king of Edom grew up &amp; married the sister <a id="l1172"></a>of Pharaoh's Queen Tahaphenes or Daphnis, &amp; before the death of David <a id="l1173"></a>had by her a son called Genubah, &amp; this son was brought up among the <a id="l1174"></a>children of Pharaoh. And among these children was the chief or first <a id="l1175"></a>born of her mothers children, &amp; her little sister who had no breasts <a id="l1176"></a>&amp; her brother who sucked the breasts of his mother (Cant. VI.9. &amp; VIII.<a id="l1177"></a>1, 8.) And of about the same age with these children was Sesac or <a id="l1178"></a>Sesostris. For he became king of Egypt in the reign of Solomon <a id="l1179"></a> (1 King. XI.40,) &amp; before he began to reign he warred under his father, <a id="l1180"></a>&amp; whilst he was very young conquered Arabia Troglodytica &amp; Libya, <a id="l1181"></a>&amp; then invaded Æthiopia; &amp; succeeding his father reigned till the <a id="l1182"></a>fift year of Asa. And therefore he was of about the same age with <a id="l1183"></a>the children of Pharaoh above mentioned. And so [ being one of the <a id="l1184"></a>brothers of Solomons Queen, ] he ] was born neare the end of Davids <a id="l1185"></a>reign &amp; must have been about 45 or 50 years old when he came <a id="l1186"></a>out of Egypt with a great army to invade the east. And by reason of <a id="l1187"></a>his great conquests, he was celebrated in several nations by several <a id="l1188"></a>names.

<p id="par57">The Sidonians being still possessed of the Mediterranean as <a id="l1292"></a>far as Greece &amp; Libya, &amp; the trade of the red sea being richer, the <a id="l1293"></a>Tyrians traded on the red sea in conjunction with Solomon &amp; the kings of <a id="l1294"></a>Iudah till after the Trojan war.

Under one of the kings, that is, with<a id="l1398"></a>in the compass of the age of a man. For so the phrase is used by <a id="l1399"></a>Isaiah chap. XXIII.15. Iosephus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n122-ref">[122]</sup> lets us know that the Annales <a id="l1400"></a>of the Tyrians from the days of Abibalus &amp; Hiram kings of Tyre <a id="l1401"></a>were extant in his days, &amp; that Menander of Pergamus trans<a id="l1402"></a>lated them into Greek &amp; that Hirams friendship to Solomon &amp; <a id="l1403"></a>assistance in building the Temple was mentioned in them, &amp; that <a id="l1404"></a>the Temple was founded in the eleventh year of Hiram.

<p id="par61">When Sesostris returned into Egypt he left Æetes with part of <a id="l1470"></a>his army at Colchos to guard that pass, &amp; Phryxus &amp; his sister Helle <a id="l1471"></a>fled from Ino the daughter of Cadmus to Æetes soon after in a <a id="l1472"></a>ship whose ensigne was a golden Ram. Ino was therefore alive <a id="l1473"></a>in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam, &amp; by consequence her father Cadmus <a id="l1474"></a>flourished in the reign of David &amp; not before. Cadmus was the <a id="l1475"></a>father of Polydorus, the father of Labdacus, the father of Laius, <a id="l1476"></a>the father of Oedipus, the father of Eteocles &amp; Polynices who in <a id="l1477"></a>their youth slew one another in the war of the seven captains <a id="l1478"></a>at Thebes, about ten or twelve years after the Argonautic expedition, <a id="l1479"></a>&amp; Thersander son of Polynices warred at troy. These <a id="l1480"></a>generations being by the eldest sons, if they be recconed at about <a id="l1481"></a>23 years to a generation, they will place the birth of Polydorus <a id="l1482"></a>upon the 17 or 18<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign or thereabouts.

At his first coming he sailed to Samothrace an island neare <a id="l1485"></a>Thrace on the north side of Lemnos, &amp; there married Harmonia the <a id="l1486"></a>sister of Iasion &amp; Darda<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>n<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>us, which gave occasion to the Samothracian <a id="l1487"></a>mysteries; &amp; Polydorus might be their son born the year after his <a id="l1488"></a> coming, &amp; his sister Europa might be then a young woman <a id="l1489"></a>in the flower of her age. These generations cannot well be shorter, <a id="l1490"></a>&amp; therefore Cadmus &amp; his son Polydorus were not younger then <a id="l1491"></a>we have recconed them. Nor can they be much longer without <a id="l1492"></a>making Polydorus too old to be born in Europe &amp; to be the son <a id="l1493"></a>of Harmonia.

<p id="par63">Ægialeus the first king of Sicyon was the brother of Phoroneus <a id="l1527"></a>&amp; son of Inachus.

And unless Chiron was <a id="l2077"></a>above eighty years old in the time of the Argonautic expedition <a id="l2078"></a>when he invented the Asterisms, the golden age will reach to <a id="l2079"></a>the end of Davids reign &amp; might reach five or ten years into the <a id="l2080"></a>reign of Solomon.  The golden age therefore falls in with the reign <a id="l2081"></a>of Asterius &amp; the silver age with that of Minos. This fable of the four <a id="l2082"></a>ages seems to have been made by the Curetes in the  beginning of the fourth <a id="l2083"></a>age in memory of the first four ages of their coming into Europe as <a id="l2084"></a>into a new world; &amp; in honour of their country woman Europa &amp; <a id="l2085"></a>her husband Asterius the Saturn of the Latines, &amp; of their son Minos the <a id="l2086"></a>Cretan Iupiter, &amp; grandson Deucalion who reigned till the Argonautic

Hesiod <a id="l2088"></a>tells us that he himself lived in the fift age, the age next after <a id="l2089"></a>the taking of Troy; &amp; therefore he flourished within twenty or <a id="l2090"></a>thirty years after it. And Homer was of about the same age. <a id="l2091"></a>For he <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n191-ref">[191]</sup> lived sometime with Mentor in Ithaca &amp; there <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n192-ref">[192]</sup> learnt <a id="l2092"></a>of him many things concerning Vlysses with whom Mentor <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n193-ref">[193]</sup> had <a id="l2093"></a>there been personally acquainted.

<p id="par78">Mythologists tell us that Niobe the daughter of Phoroneus was <a id="l2098"></a>the first woman with whon Iupiter lay, &amp; that of her he begot <a id="l2099"></a>Argus who succeeded Phoroneus in the kingdom of Argus &amp; <a id="l2100"></a>gave his name to that city.  And therefore Argus was born in the beginning of the silver age. But by Iupiter they might here mean Asterius.  For the Phœnicians gave the name of Iupiter to every king <a id="l2102"></a>from the time of their first coming into Greece with Cadmus <a id="l2103"></a>&amp; Europa untill the invasion of Greece by Sesostris &amp; the <a id="l2104"></a>birth of Hercules, &amp; particularly to the fathers of Minos, <a id="l2105"></a>Pelops, Lacedæmon, Æacus &amp; Perseus. </p>
<p id="par79">The four first ages succeed the flood of Deucalion, &amp; <a id="l2106"></a>some tell us that Deucalion was the son of Prometheus <a id="l2107"></a>the son of Iapetus &amp; brother of Atlas. But this was another Deucalion.

<p id="par80">I have now carried up the Chronology of the Greeks as high <a id="l2110"></a>as to the first use of letters, &amp; the first plowing &amp; sowing of corn, the first <a id="l2111"></a>manufacturing of copper &amp; iron, the beginning of the trades of Smiths <a id="l2112"></a>Carpenters, Ioyn<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>rs, Turners, brickmakers, stonecutters, &amp; Potters in <a id="l2113"></a>Europe; the first walling of cities about; the first building of Temples, <a id="l2114"></a>&amp; the original of Oracles in Greece; the beginning of navigation by <a id="l2115"></a>the starrs in long ships with sails; the erecting of the Amphictyonic <a id="l2116"></a>Councills; the first ages of Greece called the golden silver copper &amp; <a id="l2117"></a>iron ages; &amp; the flood of Deucalion which immediately preceeded them. <a id="l2118"></a>Those ages could not be earlier then the invention &amp; use of the <a id="l2119"></a>four metalls in Greece from whence they had their names; &amp; the <a id="l2120"></a>flood of Ogyges could not be much above two or three ages earlier <a id="l2121"></a>then that of Deucalion. For among such wandering people as <a id="l2122"></a>were then in Europe there could be no memory of things done <a id="l2123"></a>above three or four ages before the first use of letters. And the <a id="l2124"></a>expulsion of the shepherds out of Egypt which gave the first occa<a id="l2125"></a>sion of the coming of people from <span class="hspac-n" title="1 character space left blank.">&nbsp;</span>Egypt into Greece &amp; of the <a id="l2126"></a>building of houses &amp; villages in Greece, was scarce earlier then <a id="l2127"></a>the days of Eli &amp; Samuel. For Manetho tells us that when they <a id="l2128"></a>were forced to quit Abaris &amp; retire out of Egypt, they went through <a id="l2129"></a>the wilderness into Iudæa &amp; built Ierusalem. I do not think with Manetho <a id="l2130"></a>that they were the Israelites under Moses,  but rather beleive that they were <a id="l2131"></a>Canaanites, &amp; upon leaving Abaris mingled with the Philistims their <a id="l2132"></a>next neighbours, though some of them might assist David &amp; Solomon <a id="l2133"></a>in building Ierusalem &amp; the Temple<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>. <span class="nb-n">}</span></span></p>
<p id="par81">Saul was made king that he might rescue Israel out of the hand of the Philistims who oppressed them 1 Sam. IX.16. &amp; XIII.19, 20. And in the second year of this reign , the Philistims brought <a id="l2134"></a>into the field against him thirty thousand chariots &amp; six thousand horsmen <a id="l2135"></a>&amp; foot without number: whereas the Canaaanites had their horses from <a id="l2136"></a>Egypt, &amp; in the days of Moses all the chariots of Egypt with which Pharaoh <a id="l2137"></a>pursued Israel were but six hundred Exod. XIV.7. From the great army <a id="l2138"></a>of the Philistims I seem to gather that the shepherds had newly relin<a id="l2139"></a>quished Egypt &amp; joyned them. The shepherds might be beaten &amp; driven <a id="l2140"></a>out of the greatest part of Egypt &amp; shut up in Abaris by Mephramuthosis <a id="l2141"></a>in the latter end of the days of Eli &amp; some of them fly to the Philistims &amp; <a id="l2142"></a>strengthen them against Israel in the last year of Eli. And from the <a id="l2143"></a>Philistims some of them might go to Zidon, &amp; from Zidon by sea to <a id="l2144"></a>Greece &amp; other places. And afterwards in the beginning of the reign of 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p042r"> &lt;42r&gt; </span> Saul the shepherds which still remained in Egypt might be forced <a id="l2145"></a>by Thummosis or Amosis the son of Mepharmuthosis to leave Abaris <a id="l2146"></a>&amp; retire in very great numbers to the Philistims. And upon these <a id="l2147"></a>occasions several of them, as Pelasgus, Cecrops, Inachus, &amp; Lelex, <a id="l2148"></a>&amp; thence to Asia minor &amp; Greece in the days of Eli Samuel &amp; <a id="l2149"></a>Saul, &amp; thereby begin to open a commerce by sea between <a id="l2150"></a>Greece &amp; Sidon <span class="hspac-n" title="1 character space left blank.">&nbsp;</span>before the coming of the Phenicians from the red sea. </p>
<p id="par82">Pelasgus reigned in Arcadia &amp; was the father of Lycaon (ac<a id="l2151"></a>cording to Pherecides Atheniensis,) &amp; Lycaon died just before the flood <a id="l2152"></a>of Deucalion. He sacrificed children &amp; therefore was one of the shep<a id="l2153"></a>herds. </p>
<p id="par83">Cecrops might come from Sais to Cyprus &amp; thence to Attica in the <a id="l2154"></a>days of Samuel, &amp; marry Agraulos the daughter of Actæus &amp; <a id="l2155"></a>succeed him in Attica soon after, &amp; leave his kingdom to Cranaus <a id="l2156"></a>in the reign of Saul or the beginning of the reign of David. For the <a id="l2157"></a>flood of Deucalion happened in the reign of Cranaus. </p>
<p id="par84">Inachus is called the son of Oceanus, perhaps because he came <a id="l2158"></a>to Greece by sea. He might come with his people from Ægypt to <a id="l2159"></a>Argos in the days of Eli, &amp; seat himself upon the river Inachus <a id="l2160"></a>so named from him, &amp; leave his territories to his sons Phoroneus <a id="l2161"></a>Ægialeus &amp; Phegeus in the days of Samuel. For Car the son <a id="l2162"></a>of Phoroneus built a temple to Ceres in Megara &amp; therefore <a id="l2163"></a>was contemporary to Erechtheus. </p>
<p id="par85">Lelex might come with his people into Laconica in the days <a id="l2164"></a>of Eli &amp; leave his territories to his sons Myles, Eurotas, Cleson, <a id="l2165"></a>&amp; Polycaon in the days of Samuel. Myles set up a quern or <a id="l2166"></a>hand-mill to grind corn, &amp; is reputed the first among the Greeks <a id="l2167"></a>who did so: but he flourished before Triptolemus, &amp; seems to have <a id="l2168"></a>had his corn &amp; artificers from Egypt. Eurotas the brother or as some <a id="l2169"></a>say the son of Myles, built Sparta &amp; called it after the name of <a id="l2170"></a>his daughter Sparta the wife of Lacedemon &amp; mother of Eurydice. <a id="l2171"></a>Cleson was the father of Pylas the father of Scyron who marryed <a id="l2172"></a>the daughter of Pandion the son of Erechtheus &amp; contended with Nisus <a id="l2173"></a>the son of Pandion &amp; brother of Ægeus for the kingdom, &amp; Æacus ad<a id="l2174"></a>judged it to Nisus. Polycaon invaded Messene then peopled only by <a id="l2175"></a>villages, &amp; built cities therein, &amp; called it Messene after the name of <a id="l2176"></a>his wife. </p>
<p id="par86">Of about the same age with Pelasgus Inachus &amp; Lelex  <a id="l2177"></a> was Ogyges. He reigned in Bæotia, &amp; some of his people were Leleges, <a id="l2178"></a>&amp; either he or his son Eleusis built the city Eleusis in Attica, that <a id="l2179"></a>is, they built a few houses of clay which in time grew into a city. <a id="l2180"></a>Acusilaus wrote that Phoroneus was older then Ogyges, &amp; that <a id="l2181"></a>Ogyges flourished 1020 years before the first Olympiad, as above. <a id="l2182"></a>But Acusilaus was an Argive &amp; feigned these things in honour <a id="l2183"></a>of his country. To call things Ogygian has been a phrase  amongst the ancient Greeks to signify that they are as old as <a id="l2185"></a>the  first memory of things. Inachus might be as old as Ogyges. But Acusilaus &amp; his followers made Inachus <a id="l2187"></a> seven hundred years older then the truth; &amp; Chro<a id="l2188"></a>nologers to make out this recconing have lengthened the races <a id="l2189"></a>of the kings of Argos &amp; Sicyon, &amp; changed several contempo<a id="l2190"></a>rary Princes of Argos into successive kings, &amp; inserted many <a id="l2191"></a>feigned kings into the race of the kings of Sicyon. </p>
<p id="par87">Inachus had several sons who reigned in several places of <a id="l2192"></a>Peloponnesus &amp; there built towns; as Phoroneus who built Pho<a id="l2193"></a>ronicum afterwards called Argos from Argus his grandson, <a id="l2194"></a>Ægialeus who built Ægialea afterwards called Syicyon from Sicyon <a id="l2195"></a>the grandson of Erechtheus, Phegeus who built Phegea after<a id="l2196"></a>wards called Psophis from Psophis the daughter of Lycaon. <a id="l2197"></a>And these were the oldest towns in Peloponnesus. Then Sisyphus

And this is recconed the first colony which the Greeks <a id="l2206"></a>sent abraod. Phoroneus had also several children &amp; grandchildren <a id="l2207"></a>who reigned in several places &amp; built new towns, as Car, Spartus, <a id="l2208"></a>Apis. And Hæmon the son of Pelasgus reigned in Hæmonia  <a id="l2209"></a>afterwards called Thessaly &amp; built towns there. And this division <a id="l2210"></a>&amp; subdivision of territories has made great confusion in the <a id="l2211"></a>history of the first kingdoms of Peloponesus, &amp; thereby given <a id="l2212"></a>occasion to the vain glorious Greeks to make those kingdoms much <a id="l2213"></a>older than they real<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>l<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>y were. But by all the recconings above menti<a id="l2214"></a>oned, the first civilizing of the Greeks &amp; teaching them to dwell <a id="l2215"></a>in houses &amp; towns, &amp; the oldest towns in Europe could scarce be <a id="l2216"></a>above two or three generations older then the coming of Cadmus <a id="l2217"></a>from Sidon into Greece, &amp; might most probably be occasioned by the <a id="l2218"></a>expulsion of the shepherds out of Egypt in the days of Eli &amp; Samuel <a id="l2219"></a>&amp; their flying into Greece in considerable numbers. But its difficult <a id="l2220"></a>to set right the genealogies &amp; chronology of the  fabulous <a id="l2221"></a>ages of <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Greeks, &amp; I leave these things to be further examined. </p>
<p id="par88">Before the  Phœnicians introduced the deifying of dead men <a id="l2222"></a>the Greeks had a Council of Elders in every town for the govern<a id="l2223"></a>ment thereof, &amp; a place where the elders &amp; people worshipped <a id="l2224"></a>their God with sacrifices. And when many of those towns for their <a id="l2225"></a>common safety united under a common Coun<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>c<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ill, they erected a <a id="l2226"></a>Prytaneum or Court in one of the towns where the Council &amp; <a id="l2227"></a>people met at certain times to consult of th<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ir common safety <a id="l2228"></a>&amp; worship their common God with sacrifices &amp; to buy &amp; sell. The <a id="l2229"></a>towns where these  Councils met <a id="l2230"></a>the Greeks called δήμοι peoples or communities or corporation <a id="l2231"></a>towns; &amp; at length when many of these δήμοι for their common <a id="l2232"></a>safety, united by consent under one common Council, they <a id="l2233"></a>erected a Prytaneum in one of the δήμοι for the common Council <a id="l2234"></a>&amp; people to meet in &amp; consult &amp; worship in &amp; feast &amp; buy &amp; <a id="l2235"></a>sell, &amp; this δήμος they walled about for its safety, &amp; called it <a id="l2236"></a>τῆν πόλιν the city. And this I take to have been the original <a id="l2237"></a>of villages, market towns, cities, common Councils, Vestal Tem<a id="l2238"></a>ples, Feasts &amp; Fairs in Europe. The Prytaneum  (πυρὸς ταμεῖον)  <a id="l2239"></a>was a Court with a place of worship &amp; a perpetual fire kept <a id="l2240"></a>therein upon an Altar for sacrificing. From the word Ἑστια <a id="l2241"></a>fire came the name Vesta, which at length the people turned <a id="l2242"></a>into a Goddess, &amp; so became fire-worshippers like the ancient <a id="l2243"></a>Persians. And when these Councils made war upon their ~ <a id="l2244"></a>neighbours, they had a general commander to lead their armies <a id="l2245"></a>&amp; he became their king. </p>
<p id="par89">So Thucydides <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n195-ref">[195]</sup> tells us that <em class="underline">under Cecrops &amp; the ancient <a id="l2246"></a>kings untill Theseus, Attica was always inhabited city by city, each <a id="l2247"></a>having Magistrates &amp; Pritanea. Neither did they consult the king <a id="l2248"></a>when there was no fear of danger, but each apart administred <a id="l2249"></a>their own common wealth, &amp; had their own Council. Yea some <a id="l2250"></a> (as the Eleusinians with Eumolpus against Erechtheus) did sometimes <a id="l2251"></a>make war. But when Theseus a prudent &amp; potent man obteined <a id="l2252"></a>the kingdom, he took away the courts &amp; magistrates of the other <a id="l2253"></a>cities &amp; made them all meet in one Council &amp; Prytaneum at Athens. </em><a id="l2254"></a>Polemon as he is cited by <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n196-ref">[196]</sup> Strabo tells us that in this body of Attica, <a id="l2255"></a>there were 170 δήμοι, one of which was Eleusis.

<p id="par90">The original of the kingdom of the Argives was much <a id="l2262"></a>after the same manner. For saith <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n198-ref">[198]</sup> Pausanius, Phoroneus the <a id="l2263"></a>son of Inachus was the first who gathered into one commu<a id="l2264"></a>nity the Argives who till then were scattered &amp; lived every <a id="l2265"></a>where apart: &amp; the place where they were first assembled <a id="l2266"></a>was called Phoronicum the city of Phoroneus.

So the Argives composed Mantinea in Arcadia <a id="l2272"></a>out of five towns, &amp; Tegea out of nine. And out of so many <a id="l2273"></a>was Heræa built by Cleombrotus or by Cleonymus.

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p109r"> &lt;109r&gt; </span> they conquered the Lydians, had no money. Herodotus <sup class="note" id="n455-ref">[455]</sup> tells us <a id="l5562"></a>that when Crœsus was preparing to invade Cyrus, a certain <a id="l5563"></a>Lydian called Sandanis advised Crœsus that he was preparing <a id="l5564"></a>an expedition against a nation who were cloathed with <a id="l5565"></a>leather-breches &amp; made all their garments of leather, <a id="l5566"></a>who eat not such victuals as they would but such as <a id="l5567"></a>their barren country afforded, who drank no wine but <a id="l5568"></a>water only, who eat no figgs nor other good meat, who <a id="l5569"></a>had nothing to lose but might get much from the Ly<a id="l5570"></a>dians. For the Persians, saith Herodotus, before they <a id="l5571"></a>conquered the Lydians, had nothing dainty rich or valuable. And Isaias <sup class="note" id="n456-ref">[456]</sup> tells us that the Medes regarded not silver nor desired gold But the Lydians &amp; Phrygians were exceeding <a id="l5572"></a>rich even to a proverb. <em class="underline">Midas &amp; Crœsus</em>, says Pliny, <sup class="note" id="n457-ref">[457]</sup> <em class="underline">in <a id="l5573"></a>infinitum possederant.

<p id="par229">The conquest of Asia minor put the Greeks into <a id="l5587"></a>fear of the Medes. For Thrognis who lived at Megara in the very <a id="l5588"></a>times of these wars, writes thus

The Poet tells us further that discord had destroyed Magnetia <a id="l5589"></a>Colophon &amp; Smyrna  (cities of Ionia <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Phrygia)  &amp; would destroy the Greeks: which is as <a id="l5590"></a>much as to say that the Medes had then conquered those cities. <p></p>
<p id="par230">The Medes therefore reigned till the taking of Sardes. And further <a id="l5591"></a>according to Xenophon &amp; the Scriptures, they reigned till the taking <a id="l5592"></a>of Babylon. For Xenophon <sup class="note" id="n459-ref">[459]</sup> tells us that after the taking of <a id="l5593"></a>Babylon Cyrus went to the king of the Medes at Ecbatane &amp; <a id="l5594"></a>succeeded him in the kingdom And Ierom that Babylon was taken by Darius king of the Medes &amp; his kinsman Cyrus.  <sup class="note" id="n460-ref">[460]</sup> And the Scriptures tell us <a id="l5595"></a>that Babylon was destroyed by a nation out of the  north <a id="l5596"></a> (Ier. 50.3, 9, 41) by the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni (or Ar<a id="l5597"></a>menia) &amp; Ashchenaz (or Phrygia minor Ier LI.27.) by the <a id="l5598"></a>Medes (Isa.

V.) first to <a id="l5602"></a>the Medes under Darius &amp; then to the Persians under Cyrus. For <a id="l5603"></a>Darius reigned over Babylon like a conqueror, not observing <a id="l5604"></a>the laws on the Babylonians but introducing the immu<a id="l5605"></a>table laws of the  conquering nations the Medes <a id="l5606"></a>&amp; Persians (Dan.

<p id="par231">You may know also by the great number of Provinces <a id="l5611"></a>in the kingdom of Darius that he was king of the Medes &amp; <a id="l5612"></a>Persians.

<p id="par232">The same thing is also confirmed by Iosephus <sup class="note" id="n461-ref">[461]</sup> who <a id="l5616"></a>writes that Cyrus king  [ or Satrapa ] of the Persians &amp; <a id="l5617"></a>Darius king of the Medes made war upon Balthassar <a id="l5618"></a>whom the Babylonians called Naboandel &amp; besieged him <a id="l5619"></a>in Babylon the handwriting appearing on the wall the <a id="l5620"></a>night on which the city was taken, &amp; that Darius being <a id="l5621"></a>62 years old overthrew the kingdom of Babylon by the <a id="l5622"></a>help of his kinsman Cyrus, &amp; carried back Daniel with <a id="l5623"></a>him into Media &amp; there had him in great honour, &amp; <a id="l5624"></a>that Daniel built at  <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n462-ref">[462]</sup> a very beautifull &amp; <a id="l5625"></a>admirable Tower in which the kings of the Medes Persians <a id="l5626"></a>&amp; Parthians were afterwards buried, &amp; which continued <a id="l5627"></a>entire &amp; was kept by Priests of the Iewish nation untill <a id="l5628"></a>the days of Iosephus. </p>

He went against Darius, fought <a id="l5651"></a>him at Pasaradæ &amp; took him prisoner, put an end to the reign of the Medes <a id="l5652"></a>&amp; translated the Monarchy to the Persians, the forces of <a id="l5653"></a>Darius deserting him, &amp; Harpagus a Mede who commanded <a id="l5654"></a>them betraying him &amp; revolting to Cyrus. For Harpagus, whom <a id="l5655"></a>Xenophon calls Artagerses &amp; Artabazus, was an old acquaintance <a id="l5656"></a>of Cyrus &amp; commanded part of his army in conquering Crœsus <a id="l5657"></a>&amp; Asia minor, &amp; nowin revenge of an old injury done to him by Darius <a id="l5658"></a>invited Cyrus to revolt. The story how Cyrus translated the <a id="l5659"></a>Empire of the Medes to the Persians, you have at large in <a id="l5660"></a>Herodotus, <sup class="note" id="n466-ref">[466]</sup> excepting that Herodotus errs in the time &amp; in the <a id="l5661"></a>name of the king, placing the victory 22 years earlier &amp; <a id="l5662"></a>making the last king of the Medes to be Astyages the grand<a id="l5663"></a>father of Cyrus; whereas it was certainly Darius. Astyages <a id="l5664"></a>the grandfather of Cyrus was the father of Cyaxeres as well.

<p id="par235">This victory over Darius was about two years after the taking of <a id="l5666"></a>Babylon.

<p id="par257">I consider further that Ezra (chap. 4) names Cyrus, <a id="l6073"></a>*, Darius, Achswerus &amp; Artaxerxes in continual order <a id="l6074"></a>as successors to one another, &amp; these names agree to Cyrus, <a id="l6075"></a>*; Darius Hystaspis, Xerxes, &amp; Artaxerxes Longimanus &amp; to

For if in the book of Ezra you omit <a id="l6088"></a>the story of Achswerus &amp; Artaxerxes &amp; in that of <a id="l6089"></a>Esdras you omit the same story of Artaxerxes &amp; that <a id="l6090"></a>of the three wise men, the two books will agree, so that <a id="l6091"></a>the book of Esdras, if you except the story of the three <a id="l6092"></a>wise men, was origi<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>n<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ally copied from authentic writings <a id="l6093"></a>of sacred authority.
