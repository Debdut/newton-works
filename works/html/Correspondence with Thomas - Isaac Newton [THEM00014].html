<p id="par6">Sir</p>
<p id="par7" class="i10">I received your letter of Dec. 24<sup>th</sup>. &amp; the favour of those exceptions you haue made <a id="l3"></a>to some passages of my booke; which I cannot but take very kindly; seing you haue <a id="l4"></a>had, it seems, both the Patience to read it over &amp; to make reflection upon <a id="l5"></a>seueral parts of it. The argument you note p. 118. seems to me conclusiue for <a id="l6"></a>soe far as it goes; I doe there in a manner distinguish the Earth into 3 parts <a id="l7"></a>terram planam et humilem, montes mediocres, et montes maximos, And show <a id="l8"></a>upon the suppositions there mentioned, that all the Earth should bee covered maximis or mediocribus montibus, and consequently, that there should bee noe regiones <a id="l9"></a>planæ or humiles, if soe much Earth as is capable to fill the chanel of the sea <a id="l10"></a>was thrown upon a surface of equal height with the sea, as the opinion there <a id="l11"></a>mentioned supposeth. And seing wee find that there are a great many <a id="l12"></a>regions &amp; countrys of the Earth that are planæ et humiles, some lower then <a id="l13"></a>the surface of the sea, some equal to it, some little higher, &amp; a great <a id="l14"></a>many that haue neither montes magnos, nor mediocres, I conclude that the <a id="l15"></a>mountains wee find upon the Earth, greater or less, would not altogether <a id="l16"></a>fill the cavity of the Ocean by many degrees. Neither doe I mention how <a id="l17"></a>the subterraneous Ocean &amp; the subterraneous cavities, which some thinke may <a id="l18"></a>bee a third or 4<sup>th</sup> part as much as the cavity of the external Ocean; And their <a id="l19"></a>bowels or what was dug out of them must bee thrown upon the Earth too, and <a id="l20"></a>the mountaines &amp; higher parts of the Earth should bee capable of filling them <a id="l21"></a>alsoe; which how far they must come short of I leaue you to imagine.//</p>
<p id="par8" class="i0">Tis true if those dimentions were known more exactly, the  depth of the sea, the <a id="l22"></a>height of the mountaines, the quantity of the whole Earth higher then the surface of the sea, <a id="l23"></a>their proportions might bee stated more demonstratively, but soe far as wee know them <a id="l24"></a>the mountaines or higher parts of the Earth doe not answer by many degrees to the <a id="l25"></a>cavity of the sea &amp; all subterraneous cavitys.//</p>
<p id="par9" class="i0">And this calculus is confirmed by that which immediately follows to the same effect (p. 119.) &amp; is in a <a id="l26"></a>manner the same under another forme &amp; more simple; Tis in this tenour, that the <a id="l27"></a>mountaines upon supposition that they were taken out of the chanel of the sea, should bee <a id="l28"></a>equal to the first Abyss, represented there in the scheme; wheras if you suppose that <a id="l29"></a>Abyss but halfe as deep as our deepest Ocean, that calculus I thinke doth demonstrate that <a id="l30"></a>the aggregate of the mountaines of the Earth, or of all the Earth higher then the surface of <a id="l31"></a>the sea, doth not equal by many degrees the bulk of the Abyss, nor consequently the cavity <a id="l32"></a>of the Ocean which now containes it.//</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p002"> &lt;2&gt; </span>
<p id="par10" class="i0">Then the 3<sup>d</sup> argument which follows immediately p. 120. confirmes these reasonings, by <a id="l33"></a>disproueing the same opinion from other considerations. And indeed your <a id="l34"></a>supposition which men that hold this opinion must goe upon, or the idea they must <a id="l35"></a>forme of the Exteriour Earth is altogether groundless &amp; Chymerical; for <a id="l36"></a>they must suppose that there is some general or common surface of the Earth, of <a id="l37"></a>an equal height with the sea, &amp; which runs round the Earth uninterruptedly in an <a id="l38"></a>uniforme convexity, upon which surface as upon a foundation or pauement the <a id="l39"></a>mountaines were set &amp; all the Earth that was dugg out of the sea. which is a meer <a id="l40"></a>idle notion that doth not answer to any thing in nature, nor to any obser<a id="l41"></a>vation, as I haue shown there p. 120. 121. &amp; as is confirmd by all that haue to <a id="l42"></a>doe or know what belongs to the interiour structure of the Earth. These <a id="l43"></a>argumentations confirme one another, besides those general heads mentiond <a id="l44"></a>p. 117. which show the inconveniences or impossibility of this Theological opinion, <a id="l45"></a>or of the vulgar account how the mountaines, the cavity of the sea, &amp; all other <a id="l46"></a>cavitys &amp; inæqualities in the forme of the Earth came at first.//<br><br></p>
<p id="par11" class="i0">But you seem rather to incline to the philosphical accountofthese inequalities &amp; of the <a id="l47"></a>irregular forme of the Earth; namely, <em class="underline">that the heat of the sun rarefying the side of <a id="l48"></a>the Chaos that lay next it, or by the pressure of the vortext or of the moon upon the waters, <a id="l49"></a>some inequalities might bee made in the Earth, &amp; then the waters flowing to those lower <a id="l50"></a>parts or cavities would make the seas there, &amp; the upper parts of the Earth towards <a id="l51"></a>the poles which they flowd from, would bee dry land. And all this might the rather <a id="l52"></a>bee, because at first wee may suppose the diurnal revolutions of the Earth <a id="l53"></a>to haue been very slow, soe that the first 6 revolutions or days might containe time <a id="l54"></a>enough for the whole Creation, &amp; the sun in that time might convert &amp; shrinke the parts <a id="l55"></a>of the Earth about the Æquator more then towards the poles, &amp; make them holower.//</em></p>
<p id="par12" class="i0">But methinkes you forget Moses (whom in another place you will not suffer us to recede <a id="l56"></a>from) in this account of the formation of the Earth; for hee makes the seas &amp; dry land to bee <a id="l57"></a>diuided &amp; the Earth wholly formd before the Sun or Moon existed. These were made <a id="l58"></a>the fourth day according to Moses, &amp; the Earth was finisht the 3<sup>d</sup>day, as to the inanimate part of it, <a id="l59"></a>sea &amp; land, &amp; euen the plants alsoe; you must then according to Moses bring the <a id="l60"></a>Earth into this irregular forme it hath by other causes &amp; independently upon the <a id="l61"></a>Sun or Moon. Besides the Earth at first was cover'd with an Abyss of Water as both <a id="l62"></a>Moses &amp; philosophy assure us, what great influence or effect then could the sun haue <a id="l63"></a>upon the Earth which ley at the bottome of this Abyss, any more then it hath now <a id="l64"></a>upon the bottome of the sea? Thirdly, if the chanel of the sea had been formd <a id="l65"></a>this way, it would haue been regular according to the course of the sun or <a id="l66"></a>the pressure of the Moon, but there is nothing of regularity in the figure of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003"> &lt;3&gt; </span> Sea; &amp;  it lies towards the poles as much as towards the Æquator, &amp; in all degrees of <a id="l67"></a>latitude. And soe for the mountaines too; &amp; these mountaines are sometimes <a id="l68"></a>neerer the sea, sometimes further off, as throughout Asia &amp; Africa. And then <a id="l69"></a>when al's done, these causes or their effects would by noe meanes answer the <a id="l70"></a>vast mountaines &amp; precipices of the Earth, &amp; the prodigious vorago of the sea. Nor doth <a id="l71"></a>it giue any account of the subterraneous cavities,  whose bowels neither the Sun could suck out <a id="l72"></a>nor the pressure of the Moon squeeze from within the Earth.//</p>
<p id="par13" class="i0">Some of the Ancient philosophers I remember, especially the Epicureans as wee see in Gassendus, <a id="l73"></a>attempted such a like explication of the  Origin of the Earth, and of the <a id="l74"></a>formation of the sea &amp; mountaines &amp; all other inequalities. But when one considers <a id="l75"></a>on the one hand how inadequate those causes are to the effects, how indistinct, how <a id="l76"></a>unsatisfactory when presst &amp; examind; and on the other hand how congruously, <a id="l77"></a>how easily, how naturally, the Dissolution of the Exterior Earth (As wee haue explaind <a id="l78"></a>it p. 58. 59. 60.) doth at once answer all those inequalities wee now find in it, both the great <a id="l79"></a>chanel of the Ocean, the heapes &amp; huge juga of Mountaines, the Origine of Islands &amp; the causes <a id="l80"></a>of subterraneous cavitys: how easily tis applicable to them all, how distinctly &amp; fittly <a id="l81"></a>it answers them &amp; all their uncouth properties, wee cannot rationally imagine <a id="l82"></a>that they proceeded from any other causes. Especially this giuing an account alsoe of the <a id="l83"></a>universal Deluge which upon noe other  hypothesis is intelligible.//<br><br></p>
<p id="par14" class="i0">As for Moses his description of the formation of the Earth in the first chap. of Genesis, I thinke <a id="l84"></a>I haue given a true account of it p. 253. that this a description of the present forme of the Earth, which <a id="l85"></a>was its forme alsoe then when Moses writ, and not of the primæval Earth which was <a id="l86"></a>gone out of being long before. And soe when the <em class="underline">Sea</em> is mentiond there, or <em class="underline">Seasons</em> <a id="l87"></a>or any such thing it onely shows what I say; that that description respects the present Earth &amp; not <a id="l88"></a>the primæval; wherof if Moses had giuen the Theory it would haue ben a thing <a id="l89"></a>altogether inaccommo to the people &amp; an useless dstracting amusement and therefore <a id="l90"></a> instead of it hee giues a short ideal draught of a Terraqueous Earth rising from a <a id="l91"></a>Chaos, not according to the order of Nature &amp; natural causes, but in the order which was <a id="l92"></a>most conceiuable to the people, &amp; wherin they could easily imagine an Omnipotent power <a id="l93"></a>might forme it, with respect to the conveniency of men &amp; animals: Beginning first with <a id="l94"></a>what was most necessary, &amp; proceeding/ by steps in the same order to prepare an habitable <a id="l95"></a>world, furnisht with euery thing proper first for animals, &amp; then for Man the Master of all, <a id="l96"></a>&amp; whoseuer considers the whole impartially as tis represented li. 2. c. 8. I thinke will haue the same thoughts of it.//</p>
<p id="par15" class="i0">And if all Diuines were as rational &amp; judicious as your selfe, I should not feare that this would <a id="l97"></a>retard the reception of the Theory, as you suggest it may. For I would aske them in the first <a id="l98"></a>place whether Moses his Hexameron or 6 days description of the creation, doth respect the <a id="l99"></a>whole universe or onely the sublunary world, all the heavens &amp; the heaven of heavens, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004"> &lt;4&gt; </span> &amp; all the host of them stars or Angels; Or our Earth onely &amp; the Orb or heaven that belongs <a id="l100"></a>to it: And I would not stir one step further till that was determind betwixt us. Now it being <a id="l101"></a>demonstrable I thinke that the whole univers was not made out of the Mosaical Chaos, <a id="l102"></a>I would in the next place aske them whether the Sun Moon &amp; stars mentioned the 4<sup>th</sup> day, <a id="l103"></a>were made out of the Chaos, &amp; then first brought into being when the Earth was formed? <a id="l104"></a>If they grant that this Chaos did not extend to the whole universe, then they must grant that the sun <a id="l105"></a>Moon &amp; stars were not made out of it; but are mentiond as things necessary to make <a id="l106"></a>this Earth an habitable world. From which concession I would inferr 2 things, first that <a id="l107"></a>the distinction of 6 days in the Mosaical formation of the world is noe physical reality, seing <a id="l108"></a>one of the 6 you see is taken up with a non-reality, the creation of those things that existed <a id="l109"></a>before. 2<sup>dly</sup> I inferr from this, that as the distinction of 6 dayes is noe physical reality <a id="l110"></a>soe neither is this draught of the creation physical but Ideal, or if you will, morall. <a id="l111"></a>Seing it is not physically true that the Sun Moon &amp; stars were made at that time, viz. 5 or 6000 <a id="l112"></a>yeares since when the Earth was form'd. And if it bee Ideal in one part, it may in <a id="l113"></a>some proportion bee ideal in euery part. For confirmation of this I'le instance in <a id="l114"></a>another thing, Moses his Firmament, which was the 2<sup>d</sup> dayes work; by the proportion wherof you <a id="l115"></a>may easily understand that it  is noe physical reality, as it is there set down; unless <a id="l116"></a>it bee lookt upon as a memorandum onely or a memorial of the firmamentum <a id="l117"></a>interaquæum that was in the primæval Earth. You see the first property of the firmament <a id="l118"></a>as it is set down is to diuide betwixt the celestial waters &amp; the terrestriall, and the 2<sup>d</sup> is <a id="l119"></a>to bee the seat of the Sun Moon &amp; stars. Now I appeale to any man whether those 2 local <a id="l120"></a>proportions bee not utterly inconsistent? to diuide betwixt the Cælestial &amp; terrestrial waters it <a id="l121"></a>must bee far below the Moon, &amp; the cælestial waters must bee supposd betwixt it &amp; the moon; <a id="l122"></a>and to bee the seat of the Sun Moon &amp; stars it must bee not onely as high as the Moon but as <a id="l123"></a>the Sun, nay as the fixt stars which are at an immense distance aboue the Sun. Therfore the <a id="l124"></a>Firmament with these proportions can bee noe physical reality. and soe you see how is <a id="l125"></a>another day of the 6 imployd upon noe physical reality.//</p>
<p id="par16">If you make the firmament to bee the Atmospheare as you seem to doe, &amp; the vapours aboue it to bee <a id="l126"></a>the celestial waters, which upon the disruption of the Abyss were suddenly &amp; excessiuely condenst; with all <a id="l127"></a>my heart: but then how are the Sun Moon &amp; Stars pact in the firmament? and which is as bad <a id="l128"></a>how are these vapours extracted &amp; settled aboue the firmament before there is a Sun to <a id="l129"></a>extract them? Neither indeed are those vapours or clouds or any space betwixt us &amp; them <a id="l130"></a>soe considerable a thing methinkes, as to take up a 6<sup>th</sup> part of the creation; these <a id="l131"></a>things are rather a necessary consequent of the Earth formd &amp; the Sun acting upon it, then the first &amp; most <a id="l132"></a>material thing in the formation of it; and if this had been wholly omitted by Moses, his <a id="l133"></a>cosmopœia would haue appeard as compleat, &amp; wee should haue misst noe parts of our <a id="l134"></a>world. Thus for the 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; 2<sup>d</sup> day.</p>
<p id="par17" class="i0">Then for the first day &amp; the Light made then, what was that pray? what physical reality, where made <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005"> &lt;5&gt; </span> or how? was it made out of the Chaos as other things, in what manner pray? <a id="l135"></a>if not out of the Chaos, it doth not seem to belong to Moses his world, nor to <a id="l136"></a>haue any right to take up one of his 6 dayes: neither doe I know what Light was <a id="l137"></a>then first made that was not before, or how upon the formation of a planet any new Light <a id="l138"></a>would bee product. Upon the whole I confess I see noe other account of these things <a id="l139"></a>then what I haue giuen in the 8<sup>th</sup> ch. li. 2. &amp; that the Hexameron or hypothesis of 6 dayes <a id="l140"></a>is onely Ideal, accomodated to the present Terraqueous forme of the Earth; but <a id="l141"></a>the Cosmopœia, if one may soe cal it, in the 2<sup>d</sup> chapter of that Garden which God planted <a id="l142"></a>מהרם <em class="underline">a principio</em>, that is real &amp; physical, &amp; the productions of man &amp; other creatures <a id="l143"></a>there: Neither doe I see why that 2<sup>d</sup> makeing of man animals &amp; plants should haue <a id="l144"></a>been instituted if the first had been a physical reality.//</p>
<p id="par18" class="i0">Your supposition that the first revolutions of the Earth were much slower &amp; the dayes much longer <a id="l145"></a>then they are now, &amp; consequently a day might then bee a competent time for <a id="l146"></a>some great change or transformation of the Chaos, lookes pretty well at the first; but <a id="l147"></a>unless you make the first 6 dayes as long as 6 yeares or rather much longer, I cannot <a id="l148"></a>imagine that they should bee sufficient for the work. for instance the 3<sup>d</sup> day when the waters <a id="l149"></a>were gathered into one place &amp; the dry land made to appeare, &amp; consequently the chanel <a id="l150"></a>of the sea made then &amp; the mountaines, could these grand changes bee wrought in the body <a id="l151"></a>of the Earth in less then a yeares time? I thinke not in a much longer time. then the <a id="l152"></a>Sun Moon &amp; Stars which were made the 4<sup>th</sup> day, was not that a good  days work, though <a id="l153"></a>the day was as long as a yeare. then if the day was thus long what a dolefull night would <a id="l154"></a>there bee? I am affraid that would undoe all that was done on the day time, &amp; doe as <a id="l155"></a>much hurt in the state &amp; progress of nature as the day did good. But if the revolutions <a id="l156"></a>of the Earth were thus slow at first, how came they to bee swifter? from natural <a id="l157"></a>causes or Supernatural? &amp; did they come subitaneously or by degrees to that swiftness <a id="l158"></a>they haue now? if they came to it by degrees, what prodigious long life did Adam <a id="l159"></a>&amp; his children liue? Adams 900 &amp; 30 yeares would make 9000 of ours at least; &amp; soe <a id="l160"></a>proportionably of the rest.//</p>
<p id="par19" class="i0">These things, Sir &amp; some others of this nature I would suggest to those Diuines that insist <a id="l161"></a>upon the hypothesis of 6 dayes as a physical reality, which euen many of the Fathers <a id="l162"></a>as I remember haue allowd to bee onely an artificial scheame of narration, <a id="l163"></a>they supposing the creation to haue been momentaneous. And I would further desire <a id="l164"></a>these persons to explaine to me the forme of S<sup>t</sup> Peters κόσμος ἀρχαιος or ante-dilu<a id="l165"></a>vian Earth &amp; heavens; wherein it was different from ours &amp; different in such a manner that <a id="l166"></a>it was thereby peculiarly subject to perish by a Deluge, asI haue noted p. 25. &amp; in <a id="l167"></a>many other places. They must alsoe tell me what is or can bee understood by <a id="l168"></a>Moses's disruption of the Abyss at the Deluge, if the Earth was then in the same forme <a id="l169"></a>it is in now. And what that <em class="underline">Gyrus</em> or <em class="underline">Orbis</em> which both in Iob &amp; Salomons Cosmopœia is <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006"> &lt;6&gt; </span> plac't round the Abyss or face of the first waters; which I haue taken notice of p. 426. &amp;c <a id="l170"></a>&amp; li. 2. c. 8. When they haue considerd these places &amp; especially that of S<sup>t</sup> Peter <a id="l171"></a>and joynd all the other reasons both a priori &amp; a posteriori which I haue brought to <a id="l172"></a>show that the Earth was at first in a different forme from what it is in now, I <a id="l173"></a>thinke they will judge my supposition very reasonable that Moses his hypothesis <a id="l174"></a>of 6 dayes work is but the Idea of a creation accommodate to the people &amp; to <a id="l175"></a>the present forme of the Earth.//<br><br></p>
<p id="par20" class="i0">Concerning Pardise you seem to bee of opinion that it might bee under the <a id="l176"></a>Æquator: but I doe not see how this alone would answer its phænomena. <a id="l177"></a>I distinguish the phænomena of paradise (in the 2<sup>d</sup> book) into those that were general <a id="l178"></a>&amp; common to it with all that Earth, and into those that respect its particuler region <a id="l179"></a>&amp; situation. Its general phænomena were a perpetual serenity &amp; temperature <a id="l180"></a>of air without any vicissitude of seasons; longævity of animals, &amp; their production <a id="l181"></a>out of the Earth: And wee must first find an Earth capable of these things, before <a id="l182"></a>wee enquire what region of the Earth was most paradisiacal. Now these things <a id="l183"></a>I say our primæval Earth was very capable of, considering the eaveness &amp; equality <a id="l184"></a>of its surface, the temper of its soyle, &amp; its right situation to the Sun, which gaue it <a id="l185"></a>a perpetual equinox. which situation of the primæval Earth I thinke I haue shown <a id="l186"></a>both from reason p. 182. &amp;c. &amp; from Antiquity p. 291. 292 &amp;c. and I should be willing to <a id="l187"></a>know your opinion of that hypothesis.</p>
<p id="par21" class="i0">Then as for the particuler situation of paradise, whether hemispheare twas in, I doe <a id="l188"></a>not undertake to determine that by the Theory onely, but depend cheifely upon the <a id="l189"></a>testimony of the Ancients, who excepting one or two that place it under the æquator as you <a id="l190"></a>doe, did generally place it in the other hemispheare; either explicitly or by <a id="l191"></a>necessary consequence.//<br><br></p>
<p id="par22" class="i0">Sir, persueing those things that were of greatest extent in your letter, as what you had <a id="l192"></a>offerd concerning the possibility of formeing the Earth, as it now is, out of a Chaos; Or <a id="l193"></a>what related to Moses's Hexameron, Or to paradise; I haue omitted to speake to your <a id="l194"></a>exception about the Oval figure of the Earth or rather the cause of it. I suppose <a id="l195"></a>(p. 198. lin. 21. 22) as you doe, that the equinoctial parts would first endeavour to rise &amp; fly off <a id="l196"></a>but could not, because of the greater strength &amp; resistency of the air ouer those parts <a id="l197"></a>of the Earth, then the other; for you must consider that the Earth was then involved in a <a id="l198"></a>kind of Chaos or Spiss atmosphear, as tis represented p. 36. and this was soe thick &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007"> &lt;7&gt; </span> strong, that it may bee considerd as a kind of membrane or bag about the Abyss, <a id="l199"></a>and the parts of this Chaotical  orb being far more agitated &amp; in a far <a id="l200"></a>stronger motion about the equator then towards the poles, &amp; the space there being <a id="l201"></a>alsoe narrower, it would bee far more difficult to make these parts yeeld then <a id="l202"></a>those towards the poles; as if you conceiue this bag or membrane more stretcht <a id="l203"></a>or to haue a stronger tone in one part then another, it would yeeld there sooner <a id="l204"></a>where twas less stretcht or its tone was weaker. Soe that the waters attempting first <a id="l205"></a>to rise &amp; fly off at the equator, &amp; finding there a strong resistance which they could <a id="l206"></a>not overcome,they must necessarily by this repercussion &amp; their own continual <a id="l207"></a>tendency from the center in one way or other, fall off towards the poles; and soe <a id="l208"></a>conforme themselfes into an Elliptical or oblong figure answerable to that of <a id="l209"></a>their Orb or particuler vortex.//</p>
<p id="par23" class="i0">I should bee glad to know what you thinke of the opinion of the oblong figure of the Earth <a id="l210"></a>whatsoeuer the cause of it was; &amp; whether you know any argument or observation that <a id="l211"></a>either proves the contrary or demonstrates that. what I mention p. 197. of degrees of <a id="l212"></a>latitude from the poles to the equator being unequal or the spaces upon the Earth that <a id="l213"></a>answer to them, is taken out of Dechales a French Iesuite, who hath writ a large <a id="l214"></a>cursus Mathematicus, &amp; in a little tract about the general principles of Geography, hee <a id="l215"></a>hath observed that Ricciolus, the Mathematicians of Paris, &amp; Snellius, who haue all measurd <a id="l216"></a>the circuit of the Earth, &amp; to that purpose tooke the proportion of a degree, differ each of them <a id="l217"></a>in their measure of a degree, according as they tooke it more or less North-wards; &amp; finds <a id="l218"></a>they differ much what in such a proportion as the paralels where they tooke the degrees <a id="l219"></a>were more or less distant from the equator. If this observation was pursued it would <a id="l220"></a>come the nearest to a demonstration of any thing I know that the Earth is still oblong <a id="l221"></a>North &amp; South.//<br><br></p>
<p id="par24" class="i0">Sir your kindness hath brought upon you the trouble of this long letter; which I could not avoyd <a id="l222"></a>seing you had insisted upon 2 such material points, the possibility (as you suppose) of forming <a id="l223"></a>the Earth as it now is, immediately from the Chaos or without a dissolution; &amp; the possibility of <a id="l224"></a>adhering to Moses his Hexameron as a physical description to show the contrary to <a id="l225"></a>these 2 hath swold my letter too much, which will howeuer giue you noe further trouble <a id="l226"></a>then the reading, unless your humour lead you sometime to reflect againe upon that Theory. <a id="l227"></a>Sir wee are all here busy in gazeing upon the Comet, &amp; what doe you say at Cambridge can bee <a id="l228"></a>the cause of such a prodigious coma as it had.

<p id="par28">Sir</p>
<p id="par29">Your argument p 118 I acknowledg good against those who suppose <a id="l229"></a>only hills &amp; mountains taken out of the sea, &amp; it may be good against <a id="l230"></a>those who suppose all the earth higher then the sea taken out thence <a id="l231"></a>but one who would have mountains &amp; the sea made by removing <a id="l232"></a>earth from one place to another might suppose (if it were necessa<a id="l233"></a>ry) all the earth a quarter of a mile or half a mile lower <a id="l234"></a>then the top of the seas or then the lowest valleys, or even <a id="l235"></a>lower then that, was thrown out of the deep.  But the opinion <a id="l236"></a>being to me absurd, I say no more of it.  I could wish I <a id="l237"></a>was as well satisfied with your argument about the oval figure <a id="l238"></a>of the earth.  ffor it seems hard to me that a constant force <a id="l239"></a>applied to stretch a membrane (as you figuratively term the <a id="l240"></a>atmosphere) should make it shrink, unless you suppose it at <a id="l241"></a>first overstretcht by a tumultuary force &amp; so to return by way <a id="l242"></a>of undulation, &amp; that the limus of the earth hardened while it <a id="l243"></a>was in the ebb.  But what ever may be the reason of the earths <a id="l244"></a>figure you desire my opinion what that figure is.  I am most <a id="l245"></a>inclined to beleive it spherical or not much oval.  And my chief <a id="l246"></a>reason for that opinion is the analogy of the Planets.  They all <a id="l247"></a>appear round so far as we can discern by Telescopes, &amp; I take <a id="l248"></a>the earth to be like the rest.  If it's diurnal motion would <a id="l249"></a>make it oval that of Iupiter would much more make Iupiter oval <a id="l250"></a>the vis centrifuga at his equator caused by his diurnal motion <a id="l251"></a>being 20 or 30 times greater then the vis centrifuga at our equator <a id="l252"></a>caused by the diurnal motion of our earth, as may be collected from <a id="l253"></a>the largeness of his body &amp; swiftness of his revolutions.  The sun also <a id="l254"></a>has a motion about his axis &amp; yet is round.  What may be argued <a id="l255"></a>from the dimensions of the earth's shaddow collected by Lunar Eclipses <a id="l256"></a>I cannot tell, nor what from the measures on the earth answering <a id="l257"></a>to a degreee in several latitude's, not knowing how exactly those mea<a id="l258"></a>sures were made or the Latitudes of places taken.</p>
<p id="par30">You seem to apprehend that I would have the present face <a id="l259"></a>of the earth formed in the first creation.  A sea I beleive was then <a id="l260"></a>formed as moses expresses, but not like our sea, but with an eaven <a id="l261"></a>bottom, without any precipices or steep descents as I think I exprest <a id="l262"></a>in my letter.  Of our present sea, rocks, mountains &amp;c I think you <a id="l263"></a>have given the most plausible account.  And yet if one would go <a id="l264"></a>about to explain it otherwise Philosophically, he might say that <a id="l265"></a> as saltpeter dissolved in water, though the solution be uniform <a id="l266"></a>crystallises not all over the vessel alike but here &amp; there in <a id="l267"></a>long barrs of salt: so the limus of the Chaos or some substances in it might coagulate at <a id="l268"></a>first, not all over the earth alike, but here &amp; there in veins or <a id="l269"></a>beds of divers sorts of stones &amp; minerals.  That in other places which <a id="l270"></a>remained yet soft, the air which in some measure subsided out of the <a id="l271"></a>superior regions of the  chaos together with the earth or limus, by de<a id="l272"></a>grees extricating it self, gave liberty to the limus to shrink &amp; <a id="l273"></a>subside &amp; have the first coagulated places standing up like hills: <a id="l274"></a>which subsiding would be encreased by the draining &amp; drying of the <a id="l275"></a>limus.  That the veins &amp; tracts of limus in the bowels of the <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>mountains<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009"> &lt;9&gt; </span> also drying &amp; consequently shrinking, crack't &amp; left many cavi<a id="l276"></a>ties some dry others filled with water.  That after the upper crust <a id="l277"></a>of the earth by the heat of the sun together with that caused by <a id="l278"></a>action of minerals, was hardened &amp; set; the earth in the lower <a id="l279"></a>regions still going closer together left large caverns between it <a id="l280"></a>&amp; the upper crust filled with the water which upon subsiding by <a id="l281"></a>its weight it spewed out by degrees till it had done shrinking, which <a id="l282"></a>caverns, or subterraneal seas might be the great deep of Moses <a id="l283"></a>And if you will, it may be supposed one great orb of water <a id="l284"></a>between the upper crust or gyrus &amp; the lower earth, though perhaps <a id="l285"></a>not a very regular one.  That in process of time many exhalations <a id="l286"></a>were gathered in those caverns which would have expanded them<a id="l287"></a>selves into 40 or 50 times the room they lay in, or more, had <a id="l288"></a>they been at liberty.  ffor if air in a glass may be crouded into <a id="l289"></a>18 or 20 times less room then it takes at liberty &amp; yet not burst <a id="l290"></a>the glass, much more may subterranean exhalations by the vast weight <a id="l291"></a>of the incumbent earth be keept crouded into a less room before <a id="l292"></a>they can in any place lift up &amp; burst that  crust of earth.  <a id="l293"></a>That at length somewhere forcing a breach, they by expanding <a id="l294"></a>themselves forced out vast quantities of water before they could all <a id="l295"></a>get out themselves, which commotion caused tempests in the air &amp; there<a id="l296"></a>by great falls of rain in spouts &amp; all together made the flood &amp; <a id="l297"></a>after the vapors were out the waters retired into their former place.  <a id="l298"></a>That the air which in the beginning subsided with the earth, by <a id="l299"></a>degrees extricating it self mght ly pent up in one or more <a id="l300"></a>great caverns in the lower earth under the abyss &amp; at the <a id="l301"></a>time of the flood breaking out into the abyss &amp; consequently expanding it <a id="l302"></a>self might also force out the waters of the abyss before it.  <a id="l303"></a>That the upper crust or gyrus of earth might be upon the <a id="l304"></a>stretch before the breaking out of the abyss &amp; then by its <a id="l305"></a>weight shrinking to its natural posture might help much to force <a id="l306"></a>out the waters.  That the subterraneal vapors which then first brake out &amp; have ever since continued frequently to do so, <a id="l307"></a>being found by experience noxious to mans health infect the air <a id="l308"></a>&amp; cause that shortness of life which has been ever since the <a id="l309"></a>flood.  And that several pieces of earth either at the flood <a id="l310"></a>or since falling, some perhaps into the great deep, others into <a id="l311"></a>less &amp; shallower cavities, have caused may of those Phænomena <a id="l312"></a>we see on the earth besides the original hills &amp; cavities.</p>
<p id="par31">But you will ask how could an uniform chaos coagulate at <a id="l313"></a>first irregularly in heterogenous veins or masses to cause hills.  Tell <a id="l314"></a>me then how an uniform solution of saltpeter coagulates irregularly into <a id="l315"></a>long barrs; or to give you another instance, if Tinn, (such as the Pew<a id="l316"></a>terers buy from the mines in Cornwel to make Pewter of) be melted <a id="l317"></a>&amp; then let stand to cool till it begin to congeal &amp; when it be<a id="l318"></a>gins to congeale at the edges, if it be inclined on one side for the <a id="l319"></a>more fluid part of the Tin to run from those parts which congeale <a id="l320"></a>first, you will see a good part of the Tin congealed in lumps which <a id="l321"></a>after the fluider part of the Tin which congeales not so soon is <a id="l322"></a>run from between them appear like so many hills with as much <a id="l323"></a>irregularity as any hills on the earth do.  Tell me the cause of this <a id="l324"></a>&amp; the answer will perhaps serve also for the Chaos.</p>
<p id="par32">All this I write not to oppose you, for I think the main part <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010"> &lt;10&gt; </span> of your Hypothesis as probable as what I have here written, if <a id="l325"></a>not in some respects more probable. And though the pressure of the <a id="l326"></a>Moon or Vortex &amp;c may promote the irregularity of the causes of <a id="l327"></a>hills, yet I did not in my former letter design to explain the ge<a id="l328"></a>neration of hills thereby, but only to insinuate how a Sea might be <a id="l329"></a>made above ground in your own hypothesis before the flood besides <a id="l330"></a>the subterranean great deep, &amp; thereby all difficulty of explaining <a id="l331"></a>rivers &amp; the main point in which some may think you &amp; Moses dis<a id="l332"></a>agree might be avoyded.  But this sea I do not suppose round the <a id="l333"></a>equator but rather to be two seas in two opposite parts of it where <a id="l334"></a>the cause of the flux &amp; reflux of our present sea deprest the soft mass <a id="l335"></a>of the earth at that time when the upper crust of it hardened.</p>
<p id="par33">As to Moses I do not think his description of the creation either <a id="l336"></a>Philosophical or feigned, but that he described realities in a language ar<a id="l337"></a>tificially adapted to the sense of the vulgar.  Thus where he speaks <a id="l338"></a>of two great lights I suppose he means their apparent not real great<a id="l339"></a>ness.  So when he tells us God placed those lights in the firmament, he speaks <a id="l340"></a>I suppose of their apparent not of their real place, his business being <a id="l341"></a>not to correct the vulgar notions in matters philosophical but to adapt <a id="l342"></a>a description of the creation as handsomly as he could to the sense &amp; capa<a id="l343"></a>city of the vulgar.  So when he tells us of two great lights &amp; the starrs made the <a id="l344"></a>4<sup>th</sup> day, I do not think their creation from beginning to end was <a id="l345"></a>done the fourth day nor in any one day of the creation nor that Moses <a id="l346"></a>mentions their creation as they were physicall bodies in themselves some of them greater <a id="l347"></a>then this earth &amp; perhaps habitable worlds, but only as they were <a id="l348"></a>lights to this earth, &amp; therefore though their creation could not physi<a id="l349"></a>cally  <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>be<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> assigned to any one day, yet being a part of the sensible cre<a id="l350"></a>ation which it was Moses's design to describe &amp; it being his design to describe <a id="l351"></a>things in order according to the succession of days allotting no more then <a id="l352"></a>one day to one thing, they were to be referred to some day or other <a id="l353"></a>&amp; rather to the 4<sup>th</sup> day then any other if the air then first be<a id="l354"></a>came clear enough for them to shine through it &amp; so put on the <a id="l355"></a>appearance of lights in the firmament to enlighten the earth.  ffor <a id="l356"></a>till then they could not properly be described under the notion of such <a id="l357"></a>lights, nor was their description under that notion to be deferred after <a id="l358"></a>they had that appearance though it may be the creation of some of <a id="l359"></a>them was not yet completed.  Thus far perhaps one might be allowed <a id="l360"></a>to go in the explaining the creation of the 4<sup>th</sup> day, but in the  third day <a id="l361"></a>for Moses to describe the creation of seas when there was no such thing <a id="l362"></a>done neither in reality nor in appearance me thinks is something <a id="l363"></a>hard, &amp; that the rather becaus if before the flood there was no <a id="l364"></a>water but that of rivers that is none but fresh water above ground <a id="l365"></a>there could be no fish but such as live in fresh water &amp; so one <a id="l366"></a>half of the fift days work will be a non entity &amp; God must be put <a id="l367"></a>upon a new creation after the flood to replenish one half of this terra<a id="l368"></a>queous globe with Whales &amp; all those other kinds of sea fish we now <a id="l369"></a>have.</p>
<p id="par34">You ask what was that light created the first day?  Of what extent <a id="l370"></a>was the Mosaical chaos?  Was the firmament if taken for the atmosphere so <a id="l371"></a>considerable a thing as to take up one day's work? &amp; would not the description <a id="l372"></a>of the creation have been complete without mentioning it?  To answer these <a id="l373"></a>things fully would require comment upon Moses whom I dare not pretend to un<a id="l374"></a>derstand: yet to say something by way of conjecture, one may suppose  the <a id="l375"></a>Planets about our sun were created together, there being in no history any mention <a id="l376"></a>of new ones appearing or old ones ceasing.  That they all &amp; the sun had at first <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011"> &lt;11&gt; </span> one common Chaos.  That this Chaos by the spirit of God moving upon it <a id="l377"></a>became separated into several parcels each parcel for a planet.  That <a id="l378"></a>at the same time the matter of the sun also separated from the rest <a id="l379"></a>&amp; upon the separation began to shine before it was formed into that <a id="l380"></a>compact &amp; well defined body we now see it.  And the preceding darkness <a id="l381"></a>&amp; light now cast upon the chaos of every Planet from the solar Chaos was <a id="l382"></a>the evening &amp; morning which Moses calls the first day even before the <a id="l383"></a>earth had any diurnall motion or was formed into a globular body.  <a id="l384"></a>That it being Moses design to describe the origination of this earth only &amp; <a id="l385"></a>to touch upon other things only so far as they related to it, he passes <a id="l386"></a>over the division of the general chaos into particular ones &amp; does not so much as describe the <a id="l387"></a>fountain of that light God made that is the Chaos of the Sun, but only with <a id="l388"></a>repect to the Chaos of our Earth tells us that God made light upon the <a id="l389"></a>face of the deep where darkness was before.  Further one might <a id="l390"></a>suppose that after our chaos was separated from the rest, by the same <a id="l391"></a>principle which promoted its separation (which might be gravitation towards a <a id="l392"></a>center) it shrunk closer together &amp; at length a great part of it condensing <a id="l393"></a>subsided in the form of a muddy water or limus to compose this terraqueous <a id="l394"></a>globe.  The rest which condensed not separated into two parts the vapors <a id="l395"></a>above &amp; the air which being of a middle degree of gravity, ascended from <a id="l396"></a>the one descended from the other &amp; gathered into a body stagnating between <a id="l397"></a>both.  Thus was the Chaos at once separated into three regions the globe <a id="l398"></a>of muddy waters below the firmament the vapors or waters above the fir<a id="l399"></a>mament &amp; the air or firmament it self.  Moses had before called the Chaos <a id="l400"></a><em class="underline">the deep</em> &amp; <em class="underline">the waters</em> on the face of which the spirit of God moved, &amp; here <a id="l401"></a>he teaches the division of all those waters into two parts with a firma<a id="l402"></a>ment between them: which being the main step in the generation of this earth <a id="l403"></a>was in no wise to be omitted by Moses.  After this general division of the <a id="l404"></a>chaos Moses teaches a subdivision of one of its  parts, that is of the miry <a id="l405"></a>waters under the firmament into clear water &amp; dry land on the surface <a id="l406"></a>of the whole globous mass.  ffor which separation nothing more was requisite <a id="l407"></a>then that the water should be drained from the higher parts of the limus to <a id="l408"></a>leave them dry land &amp; gather together into the lower to compose seas.  <a id="l409"></a>And some parts might be made higher then others not only by the <a id="l410"></a>cause of the flux &amp; reflux but also by the figure of the Chaos if it <a id="l411"></a>was made by division from the Chaos's of other Planets.  ffor then it could <a id="l412"></a>not be spherical.  And now while the new planted vegetables grew to be <a id="l413"></a>food for Animals, the heavens becoming clear for the sun in the day &amp; <a id="l414"></a>Moon &amp; starrs in the night to shine distinctly through them on the earth &amp; so put <a id="l415"></a>on the form of lights in the firmament so that had men been now living <a id="l416"></a>on the earth to view the process of the creation they would have judged <a id="l417"></a>those lights created at this time,  Moses here sets down their creation <a id="l418"></a>as if he had then lived &amp; were now describing what he saw.  Omit them <a id="l419"></a>he could not without rendring his description of the creation imperfect in the <a id="l420"></a>judgment of the vulgar.  To describe them distinctly as they were in them<a id="l421"></a>selves would have made the narration tedious &amp; confused, amused the vulgar <a id="l422"></a>&amp; become a Philosopher more then a Prophet.  He mentions them therefore <a id="l423"></a>only so far as the vulgar had a notion of them, that is as they were phæ<a id="l424"></a>nomena in our firmament &amp; describes their making only so far &amp; at such <a id="l425"></a>a time as they were made such phænomena.  Consider therefore whether <a id="l426"></a>any one who understood the process of the creation &amp; designed to accommodate <a id="l427"></a>to the vulgar not an Ideal or poetical but a true description of it as succinctly <a id="l428"></a>&amp; theologically as Moses has done, without omitting any thing material which the <a id="l429"></a>vulgar have a notion of or describing any being further then the vulgar have <a id="l430"></a>a notion of it, could mend that description which Moses has given us.  If it be <a id="l431"></a><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>said<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> that the expression of making &amp; setting two great lights in the firmament is <a id="l432"></a>more poetical then natural, so also are some other expressions of Moses, as where <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012"> &lt;12&gt; </span> he tells us the windows or floodgates of heaven were opened Gen 7 &amp; after<a id="l433"></a>wards stopped again Gen 8 &amp; yet the things signified by such figurative <a id="l434"></a>expressions are not Ideall or moral but true.  ffor Moses accommodating his <a id="l435"></a>words to the gross conceptions of the vulgar, describes things much after the <a id="l436"></a>manner as one of the vulgar would have been inclined to do  <a id="l437"></a>had he lived &amp; seen the whole series of what Moses describes.</p>
<p id="par35">Now for the number &amp; length of the six days: by what is said above <a id="l438"></a>you may make the first day as long as you please, &amp; the second day too <a id="l439"></a>if there was no diurnal motion till there was a terraqueous globe, that <a id="l440"></a>is till towards the end of that days work.  And then if you will suppose the <a id="l441"></a>earth put in motion by an eaven force applied to it, &amp; that the first <a id="l442"></a>revolution was done in one of our years, in the time of another year <a id="l443"></a>there would be three revolutions of a third five of a fourth seaven &amp;c <a id="l444"></a>&amp; of the 183<sup>d</sup> yeare 365 revolutions, that is as many as there are days <a id="l445"></a>in our year &amp; in all this time Adams life would be increased but <a id="l446"></a>about 90 of our years, which is no such great business.  But yet I must <a id="l447"></a>profess I know no sufficient naturall cause of the earths diurnal motion <a id="l448"></a>Where natural causes are at hand God uses them as instruments in his <a id="l449"></a>works, but I doe not thinck them alone sufficient for the creation &amp; there<a id="l450"></a>fore may be allowed to suppose that amongst other things God gave the <a id="l451"></a>earth it's motion by such degrees &amp; at such times as was most suitable <a id="l452"></a>to the creatures.  If you would have a year for each days work <a id="l453"></a>you may by supposing day &amp; night was made by the annual motion <a id="l454"></a>of the earth only &amp; that the earth had no diurnal motion till towards <a id="l455"></a>the end of the six days.  But you'l complain of long &amp; dolefull nights.  <a id="l456"></a>And why might not birds &amp; fishes endure one long night as well as those <a id="l457"></a>&amp; other animals endure many in Greenland, or rather why not better <a id="l458"></a>then the tender substances which were growing into animals might endure <a id="l459"></a>successions of short days &amp; nights &amp; consequently of heat &amp; cold?  ffor <a id="l460"></a>what think you would become of an egge or Embryo which should fre<a id="l461"></a>quently grow hot and cold?  Yet if you think the night too long, it's but <a id="l462"></a>supposing the divine operations quicker.  But be it as it will, me thinks <a id="l463"></a>one of the tenn commandments given by God in mount Sina, prest by divers <a id="l464"></a>of the prophets, observed by our Saviour, his Apostles &amp; first Christians for <a id="l465"></a>300 years &amp; with a day's alteration by all Christians to this day, should not <a id="l466"></a>be grounded on a fiction.  At least Divines will hardly be perswaded to <a id="l467"></a>beleive so.</p>
<p id="par36">As I am writing, another illustration of the generation of hills <a id="l468"></a>proposed above comes into my mind.  Milk is as uniform a liquor as <a id="l469"></a>the chaos was.  If beer be poured into it &amp; the mixture let stand till it <a id="l470"></a>be dry, the surface of the curdled substance will appear as rugged &amp; <a id="l471"></a>mountanous as the earth in any place.  I forbear to describe other causes <a id="l472"></a>of mountains, as the breaking out of vapours from below before the <a id="l473"></a>earth was well hardned, the settling &amp; shrinking of the whole globe <a id="l474"></a>after the upper regions or surface began to be hard.  Nor will I urge <a id="l475"></a>their antiquity out of Prov. 8.25. Iob: 15.7 Psal. 90.2 but rather beg <a id="l476"></a>your excuse for this tedious letter which I have the more reason to do <a id="l477"></a>because I have not set down any thing I  have well considered <a id="l478"></a>or will undertake to defend.</p>
