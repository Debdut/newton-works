<h2 id="hd1" class="left">Notes upon the dispensing power.</h2>
<p id="par1">The King has a prerogative in many cases to dispence with Acts of Parliament <a id="l1"></a>but the prerogative is bounded by law &amp; many Acts cannot in any sort be dispenced with <a id="l2"></a></p>
<p id="par2">As 1<sup>st</sup> the Laws which are against mala in se</p>
<p id="par3">3. The Laws of publick concernment wherein the people are interested.  The King cannot dispence with a law made for securing the liberty or property of the people &amp;</p>
<p id="par4">2. The Laws concerning  the Iurisdiction of the Admiralty</p>
<p id="par5">4. Statutes  in which any particular subject or subjects are actually interested before dispensation.</p>
<p id="par6">5 Statutes which  absolutely &amp; directly prohibit or enjoyn a fact on pain of <a id="l3"></a>disability cannot be dispenced with after the disability attach't (as that of disability for <a id="l4"></a> Simony 31 Eliz. 6 &amp; for buying of Offices 5 Edw. 6. for sitting in Parliament without taking the Tests) And this case the <a id="l5"></a>Lord Chief Iustice Herbert granted.</p>
<p id="par7">6 Nor before without possession previous to the disability:  for the reason why the kings letters patents will not discharge <a id="l6"></a>a disability is not because it is attacht sooner or later, but because it  is a disability arising from a <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>de<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>fect in the person which renders him unfit.  And though the  date of the Letters <a id="l8"></a>patents do precede the attachment yet  <a id="l9"></a>the person holds not by dispensation  before the disability   &amp; then the  disability voyds the actually <a id="l13"></a>commencing dispensation as in the former case.  So in the cases of Simony &amp; offices a license previous to sell would be as void as <a id="l15"></a>a  pardon subsequent.  And the former case  seems the stronger of the two.  ffor the King can pardon that he cannot license.</p>
<p id="par8">7  Nor in case of   possession previous to the disability.   ffor possession qualifies not an unfit person. <a id="l16"></a><sup>‡</sup><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 1r &gt; </span> ‡ And that authority which can disable an unfit person from admission  into any Office can equally disable him from <a id="l17"></a>holding it after discovery of his unfitness.  Should a man –<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from higher up f 1r resumes &gt; </span> Should a man give   bond to resigne within a set time any Office or Living &amp; thereby get into actual possession <a id="l18"></a>&amp; then procure a dispensation to buy of his bond, tis an act of the same nature with bargaining before  <a id="l19"></a>possession, &amp; is therefore equally capable of being restrained by law against dispensation</p>
<p id="par9">The King has a prerogative in many cases to dispense with Acts of Parliament, as</p>
<p id="par10">1<sup>st</sup>  A general law may be dispenced with in particular cases which are not mala per se nor lye not against <a id="l20"></a>the reason of the law.  As when Queen Elizabeth dispenced with the common prayer in latin to  the Colleges of Winchester &amp; Eaton, the law it self allowing it to the Vniversities &amp; private <a id="l22"></a>persons  in any language they understood.  Also in Chancery the King by his Chancellor doth continually dispence with <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>the rigour<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> even of the Common law in hard cases. ffor without such a dispencing power those <a id="l23"></a> laws might often prove inconvenient with respect to persons time or place not <a id="l24"></a>foreseen by the Law makers.   The King cannot take away the force of the law for any time but only <a id="l25"></a> dispense with it in particular cases.  </p>
<p id="par11">2 Laws may be dispensed with &amp; transgrest in cases of necessity &amp; this as well by the people  in acting as by <a id="l26"></a>the king in commanding.  But  such cases are limited &amp; circumscribed  by  divers conditions <a id="l27"></a> &amp; particularly by the following two. ffirst a case cannot be necessary  which happens by the will of the King, <a id="l28"></a>or subject.  ffor that which happens to  any man by his own will <a id="l29"></a>&amp; contrivance does not happen to him out of necessity.  So  the dispensing <a id="l30"></a>with the Test to officers in the Army is not necessary  because tis <a id="l31"></a>only the Kings will &amp; pleasure first to have an Army &amp; then to have those officers <a id="l32"></a>rather then others.  Secondly the necessity cannot hold longer then  till the <a id="l33"></a>King has time &amp; opportunity to convene a Parliament.  ffor the reason of dispensing <a id="l34"></a>in such cases is because the Law-maker could not foresee &amp; provide for  them <a id="l35"></a>&amp; this reason holds no longer then till  a Parliament can be  convened. <a id="l36"></a>If therefore the King can call a Parliament &amp; will not or if upon their convening <a id="l37"></a> the case be not propounded to them or they do not allow <a id="l38"></a>it the pretence of necessity ceases.    Thirdly it must not be such a pretended case of  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span>
 necessity as the law-maker foresaw &amp; provided against in the statute <a id="l40"></a>ffourthly if the  people were interested in the law the dispensation ought to <a id="l41"></a>be for the common good &amp; not for the interest of the King alone against <a id="l42"></a>the peoples &amp; therefore  is not valid against their consent. ffor this would be to do the people a double injury.  ffirst to  <a id="l43"></a>spoile them of their interest in the law &amp; then to do it in order to a further <a id="l44"></a>injury.  And from all this its plain that the King is not the sole judge of cases <a id="l45"></a>of necessity.  His Prerogative is bounded by law &amp; he is not the sole Iudge of those <a id="l46"></a>bounds.  If  any King shall say there's a necessity of raising money without consent of <a id="l47"></a>Parliament at a time when the nation sees not the necessity, or of condemning <a id="l48"></a>men without triall, or of altering the legal course of justice &amp; setting up <a id="l49"></a>arbitrary Courts in civil matters,  to the danger of property, or of setting up <a id="l50"></a>an High Commission Court against law whereby any man whatsoever may be ex<a id="l51"></a>communicated &amp; so lose his property for not obeying all  <sup>the King's</sup> commands:  tis not <a id="l52"></a>the King's pretending necessity that will  make these things legal &amp; therefore the King <a id="l53"></a>is not the sole judge.  All men may transgress the law as well as the king in cases of <a id="l54"></a>necessity &amp; therefore are judges for their own actions in such cases as well as <a id="l55"></a>the King is for his, &amp; yet have not a right to make every thing a case of n<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><a id="l56"></a>cessity which they will call so.  ffor on this principle any people may as well justify rebellio<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>n<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l57"></a>as  any King may oppression: which God forbid.  The necessity therefore must be plain &amp; <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> <a id="l58"></a>  &amp; extraordinary &amp; such as may easily appeare to both parties to their common satisfaction.  In<br><br></p>
<p id="par12">NB. In cases of necessity all men are equally  legibus soluti, &amp; return <a id="l60"></a>into  a state of nature.  And therefore in such cases   it does not arise from the <a id="l61"></a> Kings Prerogative that he is solutus legibus  for then <a id="l62"></a>no man would be free from the Law in  cases of necessity but the King.  Nor does it arise <a id="l63"></a>from the law of the Land because it is a freedom from that law by the necessity of <a id="l64"></a>transgressing it.  Nor is it founded in any thing else then a necessity of transgressing the <a id="l65"></a> <a id="l66"></a>law &amp; acting by reason alone as in a state of nature, according to the vulgar <a id="l67"></a> proverb, Necessity has no law.</p>
<p id="par13"> Whence the dispensing power  in such cases is no part of the law of the land nor of the Kings  prero<a id="l68"></a>gative   included in that law nor   can have any other foundation than  a <a id="l69"></a> necessity of  being lawless.  So then we may  consider this <a id="l70"></a>power without medling with the Prerogative.</p>
<p id="par14">Now such a necessity as absolves a man from the law &amp; justifies his transgressing it is  a dispensation <a id="l71"></a>from it &amp; renders all other dispensations superfluous  &amp; null.  ffor as a dead man cannot be killed so while the first dispensation is in force the law cannot <a id="l73"></a>be  again dispensed with.    Such a necessity therefore excludes the Kings dispensing power by an antecedent dispensation &amp; if it  be not such it does not justify that power &amp; therefore the dispensing power in cases of necessity is a contra<a id="l78"></a>diction.   And if a contradiction may invalidate an Act of Parliament much more <a id="l79"></a>does it invalidate  the opinion of the Iudges, [or rather the opinion of those who <a id="l80"></a>sought out such men for Iudges who would subscribe to this opinion.]   At least it makes it useless because (as we have shewn) there never can be a necessity of the Kings dispensing<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 2r &gt; </span> with law.  The  necessity it self dispenses &amp;  where it does not the King cannot by virtue of it.</p>
<p id="par15"> If the King  <a id="l83"></a>command to break the law &amp; represent it necessary;  the subject  is not to break the <a id="l84"></a>law without necessity, it will not justify him that the King commanded unless the necessi<a id="l85"></a>ty be real</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 1v resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par16">  So when the English were Lords of <a id="l89"></a>ffrance &amp; ffrench Parliaments could not convene for  giving their king money, the ffrench <a id="l90"></a>laws &amp; convening of Parliaments were suspended of necessity &amp; it would <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> have been  superflous &amp; impertinent for the French King to  have put out an edict for <a id="l91"></a>dispensing with them.  But an Edict to this purpose would have been very proper, That seeing  the laws could not <a id="l92"></a>proceed nor Parliaments convene &amp; yet money was absolutely necessary for the preservation of the <a id="l93"></a>nation: he therefore required them to contribute  &amp;c.   And the obligation <a id="l95"></a>of such an edict  would not have lain in the Kings prerogative or  <a id="l96"></a>dispensing power but in the apparent necessity of the thing  for  common safety <a id="l97"></a>ffor if the people had not seen the necessity  thereof they might have justly <a id="l98"></a>refused it.</p>
<p id="par17">3 In cases of necessity  men are not always bound to observe the law of <a id="l99"></a>God.  David  being  hungry eat the shew bread which was lawful for none <a id="l100"></a>but the Priests to do.  Phinenenas  killd Zimri &amp; Cosbi against the  Commandment, <a id="l101"></a>the Maccabees upon compulsion fought on the Sabbath day,  Yet cannot the King or Pope dispense with the laws of God in cases of <a id="l103"></a>necessity.  The dispensation must arise from the necessity it self.</p>
