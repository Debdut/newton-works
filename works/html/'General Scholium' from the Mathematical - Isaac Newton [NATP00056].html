<h2 id="hd1" class="cent"><span class="smallcaps">General Scholium</span>.</h2>
<p id="par1">The hypothesis of Vortices is press'd with many <a id="l1"></a>difficulties. That every Planet by a radius drawn to <a id="l2"></a>the Sun may describe areas proportional to the times <a id="l3"></a>of description, the periodic times of the several parts <a id="l4"></a>of the Vortices should observe the duplicate propor<a id="l5"></a>tion of their distances from the Sun. But that the <a id="l6"></a>periodic times of the Planets may obtain the sesqui<a id="l7"></a>plicate proportion of their distances from the Sun, <a id="l8"></a>the periodic times of the parts of the Vortex ought <a id="l9"></a>to be in the sesquiplicate proportion of their distan<a id="l10"></a>ces. That the smaller Vortices may maintain their lesser <a id="l11"></a>revolutions about <em>Saturn, Jupiter</em>, and other Planets, <a id="l12"></a>and swim quietly and undisturb'd in the greater Vor<a id="l13"></a>tex of the Sun, the periodic times of the parts of <a id="l14"></a>the Sun's Vortex should be equal. But the rotation <a id="l15"></a>of the Sun and Planets about their axes, which ought <a id="l16"></a>to correspond with the motions of their Vortices, re<a id="l17"></a>cede far from all these proportions. The motions of <a id="l18"></a>the Comets are exceeding regular, are govern'd by the <a id="l19"></a>same laws with the motions of the Planets, and can <a id="l20"></a>by no means be accounted for by the hypothesis of <a id="l21"></a> Vortices. For Comets are carry'd with very ec<a id="l22"></a>centric motions through all parts of the heavens in<a id="l23"></a>differently, with a freedom that is incompatible with <a id="l24"></a>the notion of a Vortex.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p388"> &lt;388&gt; </span>
<p id="par2">Bodies, projected in our air, suffer no resistance but <a id="l25"></a>from the air. Withdraw the air, as is done in Mr. <a id="l26"></a><em>Boyle's</em> vacuum, and the resistance ceases. For in this <a id="l27"></a>void a bit of fine down and a piece of solid gold de<a id="l28"></a>scend with equal velocity. And the parity of reason <a id="l29"></a>must take place in the celestial spaces above the Earth's <a id="l30"></a>atmosphere; in which spaces, where there is no air to <a id="l31"></a>resist their motions, all bodies will move with the <a id="l32"></a>greatest freedom; and the Planets and Comets will <a id="l33"></a>constantly pursue their revolutions in orbits given in <a id="l34"></a>kind and position, according to the laws above ex<a id="l35"></a>plain'd. But though these bodies may indeed perse<a id="l36"></a>vere in their orbits by the mere laws of gravity, yet <a id="l37"></a>they could by no means have at first deriv'd the re<a id="l38"></a>gular position of the orbits themselves from those <a id="l39"></a>laws</p>
<p id="par3">The six primary Planets are revolv'd about the Sun, <a id="l40"></a> in circles concentric with the Sun, and with motions <a id="l41"></a> directed towards the same parts and almost in the same <a id="l42"></a> plane. Ten Moons are revolv'd about the Earth, Ju<a id="l43"></a>piter and Saturn, in circles concentric with them, with the <a id="l44"></a> same direction of motion, and nearly in the planes of the <a id="l45"></a>orbits of those Planets. But it is not to be conceived that <a id="l46"></a>mere mechanical causes could give birth to so many <a id="l47"></a>regular motions: since the Comets range over all parts <a id="l48"></a>of the heavens, in very eccentric orbits. For by <a id="l49"></a>that kind of motion they pass easily through the orbs <a id="l50"></a>of the Planets, and with great rapidity; and in their <a id="l51"></a>aphelions, where they move the slowest, and are de<a id="l52"></a>tain'd the longest, they recede to the greatest distances <a id="l53"></a>from each other, and thence suffer the least disturbance <a id="l54"></a>from their mutual attractions. This most beautiful <a id="l55"></a>System of the Sun, Planets and Comets, could only <a id="l56"></a>proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent <a id="l57"></a>and powerful being. And if the fixed Stars are the cen<a id="l58"></a>ters of other like systems, these being form'd by the <a id="l59"></a>like wise counsel, must be all subject to the dominion <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p389"> &lt;389&gt; </span> of One; especially, since the light of the fixed Stars is of <a id="l60"></a>the same nature with the light of the Sun, and from <a id="l61"></a> every system light passes into all the other systems. <a id="l62"></a>And lest the systems of the fixed Stars should, by their <a id="l63"></a> gravity, fall on each other mutually, he hath placed <a id="l64"></a>those Systems at immense distances one from another.</p>
<p id="par4">This Being governs all things, not as the soul of <a id="l65"></a>the world, but as Lord over all: And on account of <a id="l66"></a>his dominion he is wont to be called <em>Lord God</em> παντο<a id="l67"></a>κρáτωρ or <em>Universal Ruler.</em> For <em>God</em> is a relative word, <a id="l68"></a>and has a respect to servants; and <em>Deity</em> is the dominion <a id="l69"></a>of God, not over his own body, as those imagine who <a id="l70"></a>fancy God to be the soul of the world, but over servants. <a id="l71"></a> The supreme God is a Being eternal, infinite, absolutely <a id="l72"></a>perfect; but a being, however perfect, without domi<a id="l73"></a>nion, cannot be said to be Lord God; for we say, my <a id="l74"></a>God, your God, the God of <em>Israel,</em> the God of Gods, <a id="l75"></a>and Lord of Lords; but we do not say, my Eternal, <a id="l76"></a>your Eternal, the Eternal of <em>Israel,</em> the Eternal of Gods; <a id="l77"></a>we do not say, my Infinite, or my Perfect: These are <a id="l78"></a>titles which have no respect to servants. The word <a id="l79"></a><em>God</em> usually <sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> signifies <em>Lord;</em> but every lord is not a God. <a id="l86"></a>It is the dominion of a spiritual being which constitutes <a id="l87"></a>a God; a true, supreme or imaginary dominion makes <a id="l88"></a>a true, supreme or imaginary God. And from his true <a id="l89"></a>dominion it follows, that the true God is a Living, Intel<a id="l90"></a>ligent and Powerful Being; and from his other perfecti<a id="l91"></a>ons, that he is Supreme or most Perfect. He is Eter<a id="l92"></a>nal and Infinite, Omnipotent and Omniscient; that is, <a id="l93"></a>his duration reaches from Eternity to Eternity; his <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p390"> &lt;390&gt; </span> presence from Infinity to Infinity; he governs all things, <a id="l94"></a>and knows all things that are or can be done. He is not <a id="l95"></a>Eternity or Infinity, but Eternal and Infinite; he is <a id="l96"></a>not Duration or Space, but he endures and is present. <a id="l97"></a>He endures for ever, and is every where present; and <a id="l98"></a>by existing always and every where, he constitutes Du<a id="l99"></a>ration and Space. Since every particle of Space is <em>al<a id="l100"></a>ways,</em> and every indivisible moment of Duration is <em>every</em> <a id="l101"></a><em>where,</em>certainly the Maker and Lord of all things can<a id="l102"></a>not be <em>never</em> and <em>no where.</em> Every soul that has perception is, though in different times and in different <a id="l103"></a>organs of sense and motion, still the same indivisible <a id="l104"></a>person. There are given successive parts in duration, <a id="l105"></a>co-existant parts in space, but neither the one nor the <a id="l106"></a>other in the person of a man, or his thinking principle; <a id="l107"></a>and much less can they be found in the thinking sub<a id="l108"></a>stance of God. Every man, so far as he is a thing that <a id="l109"></a> has perception, is one and the same man during his <a id="l110"></a>whole life, in all and each of his organs of sense. God <a id="l111"></a>is the same God, always and every where. He is om<a id="l112"></a>nipresent, not <em>virtually</em> only, but also <em>substantially;</em> for <a id="l113"></a>virtue cannot subsist without substance. In him <sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> are <a id="l124"></a>all things contained and moved; yet neither affects <a id="l125"></a>the other: God suffers nothing from the motion of <a id="l126"></a>bodies; bodies find no resistance from the omnipresence <a id="l127"></a>of God. 'Tis allowed by all that the supreme God <a id="l128"></a>exists necessarily; and by the same necessity he exists <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p391"> &lt;391&gt; </span> <em>always</em> and <em>every where.</em> Whence also he is all similar, <a id="l129"></a> all eye, all ear, all brain, all arm, all power to perceive, to understand, and to act; but in a manner not at all <a id="l130"></a>human, in a manner not at all corporeal, in a manner ut<a id="l131"></a>terly unknown to us. As a blind man has no idea of <a id="l132"></a> colours, so have we no idea of the manner by which the <a id="l133"></a>all-wise God perceives and understands all things. He <a id="l134"></a> is utterly void of all body and bodily figure, and can <a id="l135"></a>therefore neither be seen, nor heard, nor touched; nor <a id="l136"></a>ought to be worshipped under the representation of <a id="l137"></a>any corporeal thing. We have ideas of his attributes, <a id="l138"></a>but what the real substance of any thing is, we know <a id="l139"></a>not. In bodies we see only their figures and colours, we <a id="l140"></a> hear only the sounds, we touch only their outward <a id="l141"></a> surfaces, we smell only the smells, and taste the favours; <a id="l142"></a>but their inward substances are not to be known, either <a id="l143"></a>by our senses, or by any reflex act of our minds; much <a id="l144"></a>less then have we any idea of the substance of God. <a id="l145"></a>We know him only by his most wise and excellent con<a id="l146"></a>trivances of things, and final causes; we admire him <a id="l147"></a>for his perfections; but we reverence and adore him on <a id="l148"></a>account of his dominion. For we adore him as his ser<a id="l149"></a>vants; and a God without dominion, providence, and <a id="l150"></a>final causes, is nothing else but Fate and Nature. Blind <a id="l151"></a>metaphysical necessity, which is certainly the same al<a id="l152"></a>ways and every where, could produce no variety of <a id="l153"></a>things. All that diversity of natural things which we <a id="l154"></a>find, suited to different times and places, could arise <a id="l155"></a>from nothing but the ideas and will of a Being necessa<a id="l156"></a>rily existing. But by way of allegory, God is said to <a id="l157"></a>see, to speak, to laugh, to love, to hate, to desire, to <a id="l158"></a>give, to receive, to rejoice, to be angry, to fight, to <a id="l159"></a>frame, to work, to build. For all our notions of God <a id="l160"></a> are taken from the ways of mankind, by a certain simi<a id="l161"></a>litude which, though not perfect, has some likeness <a id="l162"></a>however. And thus much concerning God; to dis<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p392"> &lt;392&gt; </span> course of whom from the appearances of things, does <a id="l164"></a> certainly belong to Natural Philosophy.</p>
<p id="par5">Hitherto we have explain'd the phænomena of the <a id="l165"></a>heavens and of our sea, by the power of Gravity, but <a id="l166"></a> have not yet assign'd the cause of this power. This <a id="l167"></a>is certain, that it must proceed from a cause that pene<a id="l168"></a>trates to the very centers of the Sun and Planets, without suffering the least diminution of its force; that <a id="l169"></a>operates, not according to the quantity of the surfaces <a id="l170"></a>of the particles upon which it acts, (as mechanical <a id="l171"></a>causes use to do,) but according to the quantity of the <a id="l172"></a>solid matter which they contain, and propogates its <a id="l173"></a>virtue on all sides, to immense distances, decreasing al<a id="l174"></a>ways in the duplicate proportion of the distances. Gra<a id="l175"></a>vitation towards the Sun, is made up out of the gravi<a id="l176"></a>tations towards the several particles of which the body <a id="l177"></a>of the Sun is compos'd; and in receding from the Sun, <a id="l178"></a>decreases accurately in the duplicate proportion of the <a id="l179"></a>distances, as far as the orb of Saturn, as evidently ap<a id="l180"></a>pears from the quiescence of the aphelions of the Pla<a id="l181"></a>nets; nay, and even to the remotest aphelions of the Co<a id="l182"></a>mets, if those aphelions are also quiescent. But hither<a id="l183"></a>to I have not been able to discover the cause of those <a id="l184"></a>properties of gravity from phænomena, and I frame <a id="l185"></a>no hypothesis. For whatever is not deduc'd from the <a id="l186"></a>phænomena, is to be called an hypothesis; and hypo<a id="l187"></a>theses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in expe<a id="l188"></a>rimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular pro<a id="l189"></a>positions are inferr'd from the phænomena, and after<a id="l190"></a>wards render'd general by induction. Thus it was that <a id="l191"></a>the impenetrability, the mobility, and the impulsive force <a id="l192"></a>of bodies, and the laws of motion and of gravitation, were <a id="l193"></a>discovered. And to us it is enough, that gravity does <a id="l194"></a>really exist, and act according to laws which we <a id="l195"></a>have explained, and abundantly serves to account for all <a id="l196"></a> the motions of the celestial bodies, and of our sea.</p><span class="pagenumber" id="p393"> &lt;393&gt; </span>
<p id="par6">And now we might add something concerning a cer<a id="l197"></a>tain most subtle Spirit, which pervades and lies hid in <a id="l198"></a>all gross bodies; by the force and action of which Spi<a id="l199"></a>rit, the particles of bodies mutually attract one another <a id="l200"></a>at near distances, and cohere, if contiguous; and elec<a id="l201"></a>tric bodies operate to greater distances, as well repelling <a id="l202"></a>as attracting the neighbouring corpuscles; and light is <a id="l203"></a>emitted, reflected, refracted, inflected, and heats bodies; <a id="l204"></a>and all sensation is excited, and the members of animal <a id="l205"></a>bodies move at the command of the will, namely, by <a id="l206"></a>the vibrations of this Spirit, mutually propogated along <a id="l207"></a>the solid filaments of the nerves, from the outward or<a id="l208"></a>gans of sense to the brain, and from the brain into the <a id="l209"></a>muscles. But these are things that cannot be explain'd <a id="l210"></a>in few words, nor are we furnish'd with that sufficiency <a id="l211"></a>of experiments which is required to an accurate deter<a id="l212"></a>mination and demonstration of the laws by which this <a id="l213"></a>electric and elastic spirit operates.</p></div>
