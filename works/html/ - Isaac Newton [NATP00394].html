<p id="par1" class="right">Cambridg. july 11. 1672.</p>

<p id="par2" class="i0">I have already told you that at the perusall of M<sup>r</sup> Hooks <a id="l1"></a><em class="underline">Considerations</em> on my Letter concerning <em class="underline">Refractions</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Colours</em><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>, I <a id="l2"></a>found nothing that as I conceived might not without difficulty <a id="l3"></a>be answered. But I must confesse at the first receipt of those <a id="l4"></a>Considerations I was a little troubled to find a person so much <a id="l5"></a>concerned for an <em class="underline">Hypothesis</em>, from whome in particular I <a id="l6"></a>most expected an unconcerned &amp; indifferent examination of <a id="l7"></a>what I propounded. But yet I doubt not but we have one <a id="l8"></a>common designe, a sincere endeavour after knowledg, without <a id="l9"></a>valuing uncertain speculations for their subtleties, or de<a id="l10"></a>spising certainties for their plainesse: And on confidence <a id="l11"></a>of this it is that I make this returne to his Discourse</p>
<p id="par3"><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup>The first thing that offers it selfe is lesse agreable <a id="l12"></a>to me, &amp; I begin with it because it is so. M<sup>r</sup> Hook thinks <a id="l13"></a>himselfe concerned to reprehend me for laying aside the thoughts <a id="l14"></a>of improving Optiques by <em class="underline">Refractions</em>. But he knows well that <a id="l15"></a>it is not for one man to prescribe Rules to the studies of <a id="l16"></a>another, especially not without understanding the grounds on <a id="l17"></a>which he proceeds. Had he obliged me by a private letter on this <a id="l18"></a>occasion, I would have acquainted him with my successes in the <a id="l19"></a>tryalls that I have made of that kind, which I shall now say <a id="l20"></a>have been lesse then I sometimes expected, &amp; perhaps lesse then <a id="l21"></a>he at present hopes for. But since he is pleased to take it <a id="l22"></a>for granted that I have let this Subject passe without due <a id="l23"></a>examination, I must referre him to my former letter, by <a id="l24"></a>which that Conjecture will appeare to be ungrounded. For what <a id="l25"></a>I said there, was in respect of <em class="underline">Telescopes</em> of the ordinary con<a id="l26"></a>struction, signifying that their improvement is not to be expected <a id="l27"></a>from the <em class="underline">well figuring</em> of Glasses as <em class="underline">Opticians</em> have imagined. <a id="l28"></a>But I despaired not of their improvement by other con<a id="l29"></a>structions, which made me cautious to insert nothing that might <a id="l30"></a>intimate the contrary. For although successive refractions which <a id="l31"></a>are all made the same way, doe necessarily more &amp; more <a id="l32"></a>augment the errors of the first refraction; yet it seemed <a id="l33"></a>not impossible for contrary refractions so to correct each <a id="l34"></a>others inequalities, as to make their difference regular, &amp; if <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018v"> &lt;18v&gt; </span> that could be conveniently effected, there would be no further <a id="l35"></a>difficulty. Now to this end I examined what may be done <a id="l36"></a>not onely by <em class="underline">Glasses alone</em>, but more especially by a <em class="underline">compli<a id="l37"></a>cation of divers successive Mediums</em>, as by two or more <em class="underline">Glasses</em> <a id="l38"></a>or <em class="underline">Chrystalls</em> with <em class="underline">water</em> or some other fluid between them, <a id="l39"></a>all which together may performe the office of one <em class="underline">Glasse</em>, <a id="l40"></a>especially of the <em class="underline">Object-Glasse</em> on whose construction the per<a id="l41"></a>fection of the Instrument chiefly depends. But what the <a id="l42"></a>results in Theory or by Tryalls have been I may possibly <a id="l43"></a>find a more proper occasion to declare.</p>
<p id="par4">To the assertion that rays are lesse true reflected to a  <a id="l44"></a>point by a <em class="underline">Concave</em> then refracted by a <em class="underline">Convex</em>, I cannot <a id="l45"></a>assent; nor do I understand that the focus of the latter is lesse <a id="l46"></a>a line then that of the former. The truth of the contrary <a id="l47"></a>you will rather perceive by this following Table computed <a id="l48"></a>for such a reflecting Concave &amp; refracting Convex, on suppo<a id="l49"></a>sition that they have equall Apertures &amp; collect parallel rays <a id="l50"></a>at an equall distance from their vertex. Which distance being <a id="l51"></a>divided into 15000 parts; the diameter of the concave Sphere <a id="l52"></a>will be 60000 of those parts, &amp; of the convex 10000; sup<a id="l53"></a>posing the sines of incidence &amp; refraction to be in round num<a id="l54"></a>bers, as 2 to 3. And this Table shews how much the exterior <a id="l55"></a>rays at severall Apertures fall short of their principall focus.</p>

<p id="par5">By this you may perceive that the errors of the refracting <a id="l58"></a><em class="underline">Convex</em> are So far from being the lesse, that they are more <a id="l59"></a>then sixteen times greater then the like errors of the re<a id="l60"></a>flecting <em class="underline">Concave</em>; especially in great aperture &amp; that without respect to the heterogeneous constitution of light. So that how<a id="l61"></a>ever the contrary supposition might make M<sup>r</sup> Hook reject <a id="l62"></a>reflexions as uselesse for the promoting of Optiques, yet I <a id="l63"></a>must for this as well as other considerations prefer them <a id="l64"></a>in the Theory before refractions.</p>

<span class="pagenumber" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span>
<p id="par7">Whether the <em class="underline">Parabola</em> be more difficult to describe then the <a id="l65"></a><em class="underline">Hyperbola</em> or <em class="underline">Ellipsis</em>, may be a query: But I see no absolute <a id="l66"></a>necessity of endeavouring after any of their descriptions. For if <a id="l67"></a>Metalls can be ground truly sphericall, they will beare as <a id="l68"></a>great apertures as I beleive men will be well able to communi<a id="l69"></a>cate an exact polish to. And for Dioptrique Telescopes I told <a id="l70"></a>you that the difficulty consisted not in the figure of the glasse <a id="l71"></a>but in the difformity of refractions. Which if it did not, I could <a id="l72"></a>tell you a better &amp; more easy remedy then the use of the <a id="l73"></a>Conic Sections.</p>
<p id="par8"><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup>Thus much conerning the Practique part of Optiques. <a id="l74"></a>I shall now take a view of M<sup>r</sup> Hooks Considerations on my <a id="l75"></a>Theories. And those consist in ascribing an Hypothesis to <a id="l76"></a>me which is not mine; in asserting an Hypothesis which as to the <a id="l77"></a>principall parts of it is not against me; in granting the great<a id="l78"></a>est part of my discourse if explicated by that Hypothesis; &amp; <a id="l79"></a>in denying some things the truth of which would have appeared <a id="l80"></a>by an experimentall examination.</p>
<p id="par9">Of these particulars I shall discourse in order. And first <a id="l81"></a>of the <em class="underline">Hypothesis</em> which M<sup>r</sup> Hook hath assigned me in these <a id="l82"></a>words: <em class="underline">But grant his first supposition that light is a body, <a id="l83"></a>&amp; that as many colours or degrees thereof as there may be <a id="l84"></a>so many bodies there may be, all which compounded together <a id="l85"></a>would make white &amp;c</em>. This it seemes M<sup>r</sup> Hook takes for <a id="l86"></a>my Hypothesis. 'Tis true that from my Theory I argue <a id="l87"></a>the corporeity of light, but I doe it without any absolute posi<a id="l88"></a>tivenesse, as the word <em class="underline">perhaps</em> intimates, &amp; make it at most <a id="l89"></a>but a very plausible consequence of the Doctrine, &amp; not a <a id="l90"></a>fundamentall supposition,  nor so much as any part of it, <a id="l91"></a>which was wholly comprehended in the precedent Propositions. <a id="l92"></a>And I wonder how M<sup>r</sup> Hook could imagin that when I had <a id="l93"></a>asserted the Theory with the greatest rigor, I should be so <a id="l94"></a>forgetfull as afterwards to assert the fundamentall, supposition <a id="l95"></a>it selfe with no more then a <em class="underline">perhaps</em>. Had I intended any <a id="l96"></a>such Hypothesis I should somewhere  have explained <a id="l97"></a>it. But I knew that the Properties which I declared of light <a id="l98"></a>were in some measure capable of being explicated, not onely <a id="l99"></a>by that, but by many other Mechanical Hypotheses. And <a id="l100"></a>therefore I chose to decline them all, &amp; speake of light in <a id="l101"></a>generall termes, considering it abstractedly as something or <a id="l102"></a>other propagated every way in streight lines from luminous <a id="l103"></a>bodies, without determining what that thing is, whether a confused <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019v"> &lt;19v&gt; </span> mixture of difform qualities, or modes of bodies, or of bodies them<a id="l104"></a>selves, or of any virtues powers or beings whatsoever. And <a id="l105"></a>for the same reason I chose to speake of Colours according to <a id="l106"></a>the information of our senses, as if they were qualities of light <a id="l107"></a>without us. Whereas by that Hypothesis I must have considered <a id="l108"></a>them rather as modes of sensation excited in the mind by <a id="l109"></a>various motions  figures or sizes of the corpuscles of <a id="l110"></a>light making varioius Mechanicall impressions on the Organ of <a id="l111"></a>Sense, as I expressed it in that place where I spake of <a id="l112"></a>the corporeity of Light.</p>
<p id="par10">But supposing I had propounded this <em class="underline">Hypothesis</em>, I under<a id="l113"></a>stand not why M<sup>r</sup> Hook should so much endeavour to oppose <a id="l114"></a>it. For certainly it hath a much greater affinity with his own <a id="l115"></a>Hypothesis then he seemes to be aware of: the vibrations of <a id="l116"></a>Æther being as usefull &amp; necessary in this, as in his own. For <a id="l117"></a>assuming the rays of Light to be small bodies emitted every <a id="l118"></a>way from shining substances, those when they impinge on any <a id="l119"></a>refracting or reflecting superficies, must as necessarily excite vibra<a id="l120"></a>tions in the Æther, as stones do in water when thrown into it. <a id="l121"></a>And supposing these vibrations to be of severall depths or thicknesses, <a id="l122"></a>accordingly as they are excited by the said corpuscular rays of <a id="l123"></a>various sizes &amp; velocities; of what use they will be for ex<a id="l124"></a>plicating the manner of reflexion &amp; refraction, the production of heate by <a id="l125"></a>the sun beames, the emission of light from burning putrifying or <a id="l126"></a>other substances whose pars are vehemently agitated, the Phænome<a id="l127"></a>na of thin transparent plates &amp; bubbles, &amp; of all naturall bodies, <a id="l128"></a>the manner of vision, &amp; the difference of colours, as also their <a id="l129"></a>Harmony &amp; Discord, I shall leave to their consideration who <a id="l130"></a>may think it worth their endeavour to apply this Hypothesis to <a id="l131"></a>the solution of Phænomena.</p>
<p id="par11"><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup>In the second place I told you that M<sup>r</sup> Hooks <em class="underline">Hypothesis</em> <a id="l132"></a>as to the fundamentall part of it. is not against me. The <a id="l133"></a>fundamentall supposition is, that the parts of bodies when bisquely <a id="l134"></a>agitated, do excite vibrations in the Æther, which are propagated <a id="l135"></a>every way from those bodies in streight lines, &amp; cause a sensa<a id="l136"></a>tion of light by beating &amp; dashing against the bottom of the eye, <a id="l137"></a>something after the manner that vibrations in the Air cause a <a id="l138"></a>sensation of Sound by beating against the Organs of hearing. Now <a id="l139"></a>the most free &amp; naturall application of this Hypothesis to the <a id="l140"></a>solution of Phænomena I take to be this: That the agitated <a id="l141"></a>parts of bodies according to their severall sizes, figures, &amp;  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span> motions, excite vibrations in the Æther of various depths or <a id="l142"></a>bignesses, which being promiscuously propagated through that <a id="l143"></a>Medium to our eyes, effect in us a sensation of light of a white <a id="l144"></a>colour; but if by any meanes those of unequall bignesses be <a id="l145"></a>separated from one another, the largest beget a sensation of a <a id="l146"></a>Red colour, the least or shortest of a deep Violet, &amp; the inter<a id="l147"></a>mediate ones of intermediate colours: Much after the manner <a id="l148"></a>that bodies according to their severall sizes shapes &amp; motions, <a id="l149"></a>excite vibrations in the air of various bignesses, which according <a id="l150"></a>to those bignesses make severall tones in sound. That the largest <a id="l151"></a>Vibrations are best able to overcome the resistance of a refract<a id="l152"></a>ing superficies, &amp; so break through it with least refraction: <a id="l153"></a>Whence the vibrations of severall bignesses, that is, the rays of <a id="l154"></a>severall colours, which are blended together in light, must be <a id="l155"></a>parted from one another by refraction, &amp; so cause the <a id="l156"></a>Phænomena of Prisms &amp; other refracting substances. And <a id="l157"></a>that it depends on the thicknesse of a thin transparent Plate <a id="l158"></a>or Bubble, whether a vibration shall be reflected at its further <a id="l159"></a>superficies or transmitted; so that according to the number <a id="l160"></a>of vibrations interceding the two superficies they may be <a id="l161"></a>reflected or transmitted for many successive thicknesses, And since <a id="l162"></a>the vibrations which  make Blew &amp; Violet are supposed shorter then <a id="l163"></a>those which make Red &amp; Yellow, they must be reflected at a <a id="l164"></a>lesse thicknesse of the Plate : which is sufficient to <a id="l165"></a>explicate all the ordinary Phænomena of those   Plates <a id="l166"></a>or Bubbles, &amp; also of all naturall Bodies whose parts are  <a id="l167"></a>like so many fragments of such Plates.</p>
<p id="par12">These seem to be the most plaine genuine &amp; necessary <a id="l168"></a>conditions of this <em class="underline">Hypothesis</em>. And they agree so justly with <a id="l169"></a>my Theories, that if M<sup>r</sup> Hook think fit to apply them, he need <a id="l170"></a>not on that account feare a divorce from it. But yet how <a id="l171"></a>he will defend it from other difficulties I know not: For to me <a id="l172"></a>the fundamentall supposition it selfe seemes impossible; namely <a id="l173"></a>that the waves or vibrations of any fluid can like the rays <a id="l174"></a>of Light be propagated in streight lines, without a continu<a id="l175"></a>all &amp; very extravagant spreading &amp; bending every way <a id="l176"></a>into the quiescent Medium where they are terminated by it. <a id="l177"></a>I am mistaken if there be not both <em class="underline">Experiment &amp; Demonstra<a id="l178"></a>tion</em> to the contrary. And as to the other two or three <em class="underline">Hypotheses</em> <a id="l179"></a>which he mentions, I had rather beleive them Subject to the like <a id="l180"></a>difficulties, then suspect that M<sup>r</sup> Hook should select the worst <a id="l181"></a>for his own.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p020v"> &lt;20v&gt; </span>
<p id="par13">What I have said of this, may be easily applyed to all <a id="l182"></a>other <em class="underline">Mechanicall Hypotheses</em> in which light is supposed to be caused <a id="l183"></a>by any pression or motion whatsoever excited in the Æther by <a id="l184"></a>the agitated parts of luminous Bodies. For it seems impossible <a id="l185"></a>that any of those motions or pressions can be propagated in streight <a id="l186"></a>lines without the like spreading every way into the shaddowed <a id="l187"></a>Medium on which they border. But yet if any man can think <a id="l188"></a>it possible, he must at least allow that those motions or endeavours <a id="l189"></a>to motion caused in the Æther by the severall parts of any lucid <a id="l190"></a>body which differ in size figure &amp; agitation, must necessarily be <a id="l191"></a>unequall. Which is enough to denominate light an aggregate of <a id="l192"></a>difform rays according to any of those Hypotheses. And if those <a id="l193"></a>originall inequalities may suffice to difference the rays in colour <a id="l194"></a>&amp; refrangibility, I see no reason why they that adhere to any <a id="l195"></a>of those Hypotheses, should seek for other causes of these effects, <a id="l196"></a>unlesse (to use M<sup>r</sup> Hooks argument) they will multiply entities <a id="l197"></a>without necessity.</p>
<p id="par14"><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>The third thing to be considered is the condition of <a id="l198"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Hooks concessions, which is that I would explicate my <a id="l199"></a><em class="underline">Theories</em> by his <em class="underline">Hypothesis</em>. And if I could but comply with him <a id="l200"></a>in that point there would be little or no difference between <a id="l201"></a>us. For he grants that without any respect to a different <a id="l202"></a>incidence of rays there are different refractions; but he would <a id="l203"></a>have it explicated not by the different refrangibility of <a id="l204"></a>severall rays, but by the splitting &amp; rarefying of æthereall <a id="l205"></a>pulses. He grants my third, fourth, &amp; sixt Propositions, the <a id="l206"></a>sense of which is, that uncompounded colours are unchange<a id="l207"></a>able, &amp; that compounded colours are changeable onely by <a id="l208"></a>resolving them into the colours are changeable onely by <a id="l209"></a>resolving them into the colours of which they are compounded, <a id="l210"></a>&amp; that all the changes which can be wrought in colours are <a id="l211"></a>effected onely by variously mixing or parting them: but <a id="l212"></a>he grants them on  condition that I will explicate colours <a id="l213"></a>by the two sides of a split pulse, &amp; so make but two species <a id="l214"></a>of them, accounting all other colours in the world to be <a id="l215"></a>but various degrees &amp; dilutings of those two. And hee further <a id="l216"></a>grants that whitenesse is produced by the convention of all <a id="l217"></a>colours but then I must allow it to be not onely by <a id="l218"></a>mixture of those colours, but by a further uniting of the parts of the <a id="l219"></a>ray supposed to be formerly split.</p>
<p id="par15">If I would proceed to examin these his explications, I <a id="l220"></a>think it would be no difficult matter to shew that they are <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021r"> &lt;21r&gt; </span>   onely <em class="underline">insufficient</em>, but in some respects <em class="underline">unintelligible</em>. <a id="l221"></a>For though it be easy to conceive how motion may be dilated &amp; <a id="l222"></a>spread, or how parallel motions may become diverging, yet <a id="l223"></a>I understand not by what Artifice any linear motion can by a <a id="l224"></a>refracting superficies be <em class="underline">infinitely</em> dilated &amp; rarefied so as to <a id="l225"></a>become superficiall; or if that be supposed, yet I understand <a id="l226"></a>as little why it should be split at so small an angle onely, <a id="l227"></a>&amp; not rather spread &amp; dispersed through the whole angle of <a id="l228"></a>refraction. And further though I can easily imagin how unlike <a id="l229"></a>motions may cross one another, yet I cannot well conceive how <a id="l230"></a>they should coalesce into one <em class="underline">uniforme</em> motion, &amp; then part again <a id="l231"></a>&amp; recover their former unlikenesse; notwithstanding that I conjec<a id="l232"></a>ture the ways by which M<sup>r</sup> Hook may endeavour to explain it. <a id="l233"></a>So that the direct uniform &amp; undisturbed pulses should be split <a id="l234"></a>&amp; disturbed by refraction, &amp; yet the oblique &amp; disturbed pluses <a id="l235"></a>persist without splitting or further disturbance by following <a id="l236"></a>refractions, is as unintelligible. And there is as great a difficulty <a id="l237"></a>in the number of colours as you will see hereafter.</p>
<p id="par16"><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup>But whatever be the advantages or disadvantages of this <em class="underline">Hy<a id="l239"></a>pothesis</em>, I hope M<sup>r</sup> Hook will excuse me from taking it up, <a id="l240"></a>since I do not think it needfull to explicate my Doctrine by <a id="l241"></a>any Hypothesis at all. For if Light be considered abstractedly <a id="l242"></a>without respect to any Hypothesis, I can as easily conceive that the <a id="l243"></a>severall parts of a shining body may emit rays of differing <a id="l244"></a>colours &amp; other qualities, of all which light is constituted, as that <a id="l245"></a>the severall parts of a false or uneven string, or of unevenly agitated <a id="l246"></a>water in a Brook or Cataract, or the severall Pipes of an Orga<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>ne<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l247"></a>inspired all at once, or all the variety of sounding bodies in the <a id="l248"></a>world together, should produce sounds of severall tones, &amp; propa<a id="l249"></a>gate them through the Air confusedly intermixed. And if there <a id="l250"></a>were any naturall bodies which could reflect sounds of one <a id="l251"></a>tone &amp; stifle or transmit those of another; then as the Echo <a id="l252"></a>of a confused aggregate of all tones would be that parti<a id="l253"></a>cular tone which the echoing body is disposed to reflect; so since <a id="l254"></a>(even by M<sup>r</sup> Hooks concessions) there are bodies apt to reflect <a id="l255"></a>rays of one colour &amp; stifle or transmit those of another, I can <a id="l256"></a>as easily conceive that those bodies when illuminated by a mixture <a id="l257"></a>of all colours must appear of that colour onely which they reflect.</p>
<p id="par17">But when M<sup>r</sup> Hook would insinuate a difficulty in these things <a id="l258"></a>by alluding to sounds in the <em class="underline">string</em> of a musicall Instrument before percussion, <a id="l259"></a>or in the <em class="underline">Air</em> of an <em class="underline">Organ Bellows</em> before its arrivall at the Pipes, <a id="l260"></a>I must confesse I understand it as little as if he had spoke of light <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021v"> &lt;21v&gt; </span> in a piece of wood before it be set on fire, or in the oyle of a <a id="l261"></a>Lamp before it ascend up the Match to feed the flame.</p>
<p id="par18"><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup>You see therefore how much it is besides the buisinesse in <a id="l262"></a>hand to dispute about <em class="underline">Hypotheses</em>: For which reason I shall now in <a id="l263"></a>the last place proceed to abstract the difficulties involved in M<sup>r</sup> Hooks <a id="l264"></a>discourse, &amp; without having regard to any Hypothesis consider them <a id="l265"></a>in generall termes. And they may be reduced to these three <em class="underline">Queries</em>. <a id="l266"></a>Whether the unequall refractions made without respect to any <a id="l267"></a>inequality of incidence, be caused by the different refrangibility <a id="l268"></a>of severall rays, or by the splitting breaking or dissipating the <a id="l269"></a>same ray into diverging parts;  Whether there be more then <a id="l270"></a>two sorts of colours; &amp; whether whitenesse be a mixture of all <a id="l271"></a>colours</p>
<p id="par19"><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup>The first of these Queries you may find already determined <a id="l272"></a>by an experiment in my former Letter, the designe of which was to <a id="l273"></a>show that the length of the coloured Image proceeded not from <a id="l274"></a>any unevennesse in the glasse, or any other <em class="underline">contingent irregularity</em> <a id="l275"></a>in the refractions. Amongst other irregularities I know not what <a id="l276"></a>is more obvious to suspect then a fortuitous dilating &amp; spreading of <a id="l277"></a>light  after some such manner as Des-Cartes hath <a id="l278"></a>described in his æthereall refractions for explicating the Tayle <a id="l279"></a>of a Comet, or as M<sup>r</sup> Hook now supposeth to be effected by the <a id="l280"></a>splitting &amp; rarefying of his æthereall pulses. And to prevent <a id="l281"></a>the suspicion of any such irregularities, I told you that I re<a id="l282"></a>fracted the light contrary ways with two Prisms successively, to <a id="l283"></a>destroy thereby the regular effects of the first Prism by the second, <a id="l284"></a>&amp; to discover the irregular effects by augmenting them with iterated <a id="l285"></a>refractions. Now amongst other irregularities, if the first Prism <a id="l286"></a>had spread &amp; dissipated every ray into an indefinite number of <a id="l287"></a>diverging parts, the second should in like manner have spread <a id="l288"></a>&amp; dissipated every one of those parts into a further indefinite <a id="l289"></a>number, whereby the Image would have been still more dilated; <a id="l290"></a>contrary to the event. And this ought to have happened be<a id="l291"></a>cause those linear diverging parts depend not on one another <a id="l292"></a>for the manner of their refraction, but are every one of <a id="l293"></a>them as truly &amp; completely rays as the whole was before <a id="l294"></a>its incidence; as may appeare by intercepting them severally.</p>
<p id="par20">The reasonablenesse of this proceeding will perhaps better <a id="l295"></a>appear by acquainting you with this further circumstance. I <a id="l296"></a>sometimes placed the second Prism in a position transferse to the <a id="l297"></a>first, on designe to try if it would make the long Image become <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022r"> &lt;22r&gt; </span> four-square by refractions crossing those which had drawn the <a id="l298"></a>round Image into a long one. For if amongst other irregula<a id="l299"></a>rities the refraction of the first Prism did by splitting dilate <a id="l300"></a>a linear ray into a superficiall, the crosse refractions of that <a id="l301"></a>second Prism ought by further splitting to dilate &amp; draw that <a id="l302"></a>superficiall ray into a pyramidall Solid. But upon tryall I <a id="l303"></a>found it otherwise, the image being as regularly oblong as <a id="l304"></a>before, and inclined to both the Prisms at an angle of <a id="l305"></a>45 degrees.</p>
<p id="par21">I tryed also all other Positions of the second Prism by <a id="l306"></a>turning the ends about its middle part, &amp; in no case could <a id="l307"></a>observe any such irregularity. The Image was ever alike <a id="l308"></a>inclined to both Prisms, its breadth  answering to the Suns diameter, <a id="l309"></a>&amp; its length being greater or lesse accordingly as the refractions <a id="l310"></a>more or lesse agreed or contradicted one another.</p>
<p id="par22">And by these observations since the breadth of the Image <a id="l311"></a>was not augmented by the crosse refractions of the second Prism, <a id="l312"></a>that refraction must have been performed without any splitting <a id="l313"></a>or dilating of the ray, &amp; therefore at least the light incident <a id="l314"></a>on that Prism must be granted an aggregate of rays <em class="underline">unequally <a id="l315"></a>refrangible</em> in my sense. And since the Image was equally <a id="l316"></a>inclined to both Prisms, &amp; consequently the refractions alike <a id="l317"></a>in both,  it argues that they were performed according to <a id="l318"></a>some constant <em class="underline">law</em> without any irregularity.</p>
<p id="par23"><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup>To determin the second Query M<sup>r</sup> Hook refers to an <a id="l319"></a>experiment made with two <em class="underline">wedge-like Bones</em>, the designe of which <a id="l320"></a>was to produce all colours out of a mixture of two. But there <a id="l321"></a>is a double defect in this Instance. For it appeares not that by this <a id="l322"></a>Experiment all colours can be produced out of two; &amp; if they <a id="l323"></a>could yet the Inference would not follow.</p>
<p id="par24">That all colours cannot by the Experiment be produced out of two, will appeare by considering that the tincture of <a id="l324"></a><em class="underline">Aloes</em> which afforded one of those colours<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup>, was not all over <a id="l325"></a>of one uniform colour, but appeared <em class="underline">yellow</em> neare the edg of <a id="l326"></a>the Box, &amp; <em class="underline">red</em> at  other places where it was thicker: afford<a id="l327"></a>ing all variety of colours from a pale <em class="underline">Yellow</em> to a deep <em class="underline">red</em> <a id="l328"></a>or <em class="underline">scarlet</em> according to the various thicknesse of the liquor. <a id="l329"></a>And so the solution of <em class="underline">Copper</em> which afforded the other colour <a id="l330"></a>was of various <em class="underline">Blues</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Indicos</em>. So that instead of two colours <a id="l331"></a>here is a great variety made use of for the production of <a id="l332"></a>all others. Thus for instance, to produce all sorts of <em class="underline">Greens</em>, the <a id="l333"></a>severall degrees of <em class="underline">Yellow</em> &amp; pale <em class="underline">Blew</em> must be mixed, but to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022v"> &lt;22v&gt; </span> compound <em class="underline">Purples</em>, the <em class="underline">Scarlet</em> &amp; deep <em class="underline">Blew or Indico</em> are to be the <a id="l334"></a>ingredients.</p>
<p id="par25">Now if M<sup>r</sup> Hook contend that all the <em class="underline">Reds</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Yellows</em> <a id="l335"></a>of the one liquor, or <em class="underline">Blews</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Indicos</em> of the other, are onely <a id="l336"></a>various degrees &amp; dilutings of the same colour, &amp; not divers colours, <a id="l337"></a>that is a begging of the Question; &amp; I should as soon grant that <a id="l338"></a>the two <em class="underline">Thirds</em> or <em class="underline">Sixts</em> in Musick are but severall degrees of <a id="l339"></a>the same sound, &amp; not divers sounds. Certainly it is much better <a id="l340"></a>to beleive our senses informing us that Red &amp; Yellow are divers <a id="l341"></a>colours, &amp; to make it a Philosophicall Query, why the same <a id="l342"></a>Liquor doth according to its various thicknesse appear of those <a id="l343"></a>divers colours, then to suppose them to be the same colour because <a id="l344"></a>exhibited by the same liquor. For if that were a sufficient <a id="l345"></a>reason, then <em class="underline">Blew</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Yellow</em> must also be the same colour, since <a id="l346"></a>they are both exhibited by the same Tincture of <em class="underline">Nephritick <a id="l347"></a>Wood</em>.</p>
<p id="par26">But that they are divers colours you will more fully under<a id="l348"></a>stand by the reason of them; which is this. The Tincture of <em class="underline">Aloes</em> <a id="l349"></a>is qualified to transmit most easily the rays indued with red, most <a id="l350"></a>difficultly the rays indued with violet, &amp; with intermediate degrees <a id="l351"></a>of facility the rays indued with intermediate colours. So that where <a id="l352"></a>the liquor is very thin it may suffice to intercept most of the <a id="l353"></a>Violet, &amp; yet transmit most of the other colours; all which together <a id="l354"></a>must compound a middle colour, that is, a faint Yellow. And <a id="l355"></a>where it is so much thicker as also to intercept most of the Blew <a id="l356"></a>&amp; Green , the remaining Green Yellow &amp; Red must compound <a id="l357"></a>an Orang. And where the thicknesse is so great that scarce any <a id="l358"></a>rays can passe through it besides those indued with Red, it must <a id="l359"></a>appeare of that colour, &amp; that so much the deeper &amp; obscurer by <a id="l360"></a>how much the liquor is thicker. And the same may be understood <a id="l361"></a>of the various degrees of Blew exhibited by the solution of <em class="underline">Copper</em> <a id="l362"></a>by reason of its disposition to intercept Red most easily &amp; transmit <a id="l363"></a>a deep Blew or Indico colour most freely.</p>
<p id="par27">But supposing that all colours might according to this expe<a id="l364"></a>riment be produced out of two by mixture, yet it follows not <a id="l365"></a>that those two are the onely <em class="underline">originall</em> colours, &amp; that for a double <a id="l366"></a>reason. First because those two are  <a id="l367"></a>not themselves originall colours but compounded o others; there <a id="l368"></a>being no liquor nor any other body in nature whose colour in <a id="l369"></a>day-light is wholly uncompounded. And then because though those <a id="l370"></a>two were originall &amp; all others might be compounded of them, yet <a id="l371"></a>it follows not that they cannot be otherwise produced. For I sayd <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023r"> &lt;23r&gt; </span> they had a double origin, the same colours to sense being in some <a id="l372"></a>case compounded &amp; in others uncompounded; &amp; sufficiently declared <a id="l373"></a>in my third &amp; fourth Propositions &amp; in the Conclusion by what <a id="l374"></a>Properties the one might be known &amp; distinguished from the other. <a id="l375"></a>But because I suspect by some circumstances that the <em class="underline">Distinction</em> <a id="l376"></a>might not be rightly apprehended, I shall once more declare it, <a id="l377"></a>&amp; further explaine it by examples.</p>
<p id="par28">That colour is <em class="underline">primary or originall which cannot by any <a id="l378"></a>art be changed, &amp; whose rays are all alike refrangible; &amp; that <a id="l379"></a>compounded which is changeable into other colours, &amp; whose <a id="l380"></a>rays are not alike refrangible</em>. For instance to know whether <a id="l381"></a>the colour of any <em class="underline">Green</em> Object be compounded or not, view <a id="l382"></a>it through a Prism, &amp; if it appear confused, &amp; the edges tinged <a id="l383"></a>with blew yellow or any variety of other colours, then is that <a id="l384"></a>Green compounded of such colours as at its edges emerge out <a id="l385"></a>of it. But if it appeare distinct, &amp; well defined, &amp; intirely <a id="l386"></a>Green to the very edges without any other colours emerging, it is <a id="l387"></a>of an originall &amp; uncompounded Green. In like manner if a <a id="l388"></a>refracted beam of light being cast on a white wall exhibit a <a id="l389"></a>Green colour, to know whether that he compounded, refract the <a id="l390"></a>Beam with an interposed Prism; &amp; if you find any difformity <a id="l391"></a>in the refractions, &amp; the Green be transformed into Blew Yellow <a id="l392"></a>or any variety of other colours, you may conclude that it was <a id="l393"></a>compounded of those colours which emerge. But if the refractions <a id="l394"></a>be uniforme, &amp; the Green persist without any change of colour; <a id="l395"></a>then is it originall &amp; uncompounded. And the reason why I <a id="l396"></a>call it so, is because a Green indued with such properties cannot <a id="l397"></a>be produced by any mixing of other colours.</p>
<p id="par29">Now if two <em class="underline">Green Objects</em> may to the naked eye appeare <a id="l398"></a>of the same colour, &amp; yet one of them through a Prism seem <a id="l399"></a>confused &amp; variegated with other colours at the edges, &amp; the other <a id="l400"></a>distinct &amp; intirely Green;  or if there may be two <a id="l401"></a>beames of light which falling on a white wall do to the naked eye <a id="l402"></a>exhibit the same green colour, &amp; yet one of them when transmitted <a id="l403"></a>through a Prism be uniformely &amp; regularly refracted, &amp; retain <a id="l404"></a>its colour unchanged, &amp; the other be irregularly refracted &amp; made <a id="l405"></a>to divaricate into a multitude of other colours: I suppose these <a id="l406"></a>two Greens will in both cases be granted of a different origine &amp; <a id="l407"></a>constitution. And if by mixing  colours a Green cannot be <a id="l408"></a>compounded with the properties of the <em class="underline">unchangeable Green</em>; I think <a id="l409"></a>I may call that an uncompounded colour, especially since its rays <a id="l410"></a>are all alike refrangible, &amp; uniform in all respects.</p>
<p id="par30">The same rule is to be observed in examining whether <a id="l411"></a><em class="underline">Red, Orange, Yellow, Blew</em>, or any other colour be compounded or <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023v"> &lt;23v&gt; </span> not. And by the way since all <em class="underline">white</em> Objects through the Prism <a id="l412"></a>appeare confused &amp; terminated with colours; whitenesse must according <a id="l413"></a>to this distinction be ever compounded, &amp; that the most of all colours, <a id="l414"></a>because it is the most confused &amp; changed by refractions.</p>
<p id="par31">From hence I may take occasion to communicate a way for <a id="l415"></a>the improvement of <em class="underline">Microscopes</em> by refraction; which I doe the more <a id="l416"></a>willingly because M<sup>r</sup> Hook hath made such excellent use of that <a id="l417"></a>Instrument, &amp; I shall be glad if it will contribute any thing to the <a id="l418"></a>promotion of those his ingenious endeavours, or add to his Inventions <a id="l419"></a>of that kind. The way is by illuminating the Object in a darkened <a id="l420"></a>Room with light of any convenient colour not too much com<a id="l421"></a>pounded. For by that meanes the Microscope will with distinctnesse <a id="l422"></a>beare a deeper Charge &amp; larger Aperture; especially if its <a id="l423"></a>construction be such as I may hereafter describe. For the advan<a id="l424"></a>tage in ordinary Microscopes will not be so sensible.</p>
<p id="par32"><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup>There remaines now the third Query to be considered, &amp; <a id="l425"></a>that is, whether <em class="underline">whitenesse</em> be an uniform colour or a dissimilar <a id="l426"></a>mixture of all colours. The <em class="underline">experiment</em> which I brought to decide it <a id="l427"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Hook thinks may be otherwise explaned, &amp; so concludes nothing. <a id="l428"></a>But he might easily have satisfied himselfe by trying what would <a id="l429"></a>be the result of a mixture of all colours. And that very <a id="l430"></a>Experiment might have satisfied him if he had examined it <a id="l431"></a>by the various circumstances. One circumstance I there declared <a id="l432"></a>of which I see no notise taken: &amp; it is that if any colour at the <a id="l433"></a>Lens be intercepted, the whitenesse will be changed into the other <a id="l434"></a>colours. If all the colours but red be intercepted, that red alone in <a id="l435"></a>the concourse or crossing of the rays will not constitute whitenesse, <a id="l436"></a>but continues as much red as before; &amp; so of the other colours. <a id="l437"></a>So that the businesse is not onely to shew how rays which before <a id="l438"></a>the concours exhibit colours, doe in the concours exhibit white: <a id="l439"></a>But to show how in the same place where the severall sorts <a id="l440"></a>of rays apart exhibit severall colours, a confusion of all <a id="l441"></a>together make white. For instance if Red alone be first <a id="l442"></a>transmitted to the paper at the plce of concourse, &amp; then the <a id="l443"></a>other colours be let fall on that Red, the question will be <a id="l444"></a>whether they convert it into white by mixing with it onely, as <a id="l445"></a>Blew falling on Yellow light is supposed to compound Green; <a id="l446"></a>or whether there be some further change wrought in the colours <a id="l447"></a>by their mutuall acting on one another, untill, like contrary <a id="l448"></a>Peripatetic Qualities, they become assimilated. And he that shall <a id="l449"></a>explicate this last case <em class="underline">Mechanically</em> must conquer a double impos<a id="l450"></a>sibility. He must first show that many unlike motions in a fluid <a id="l451"></a>can be clashing so act on one another &amp; change each other as to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024r"> &lt;24r&gt; </span> become one uniform motion; &amp; then that an uniform motion <a id="l452"></a>can of it selfe without any new unequall impressions, depart into <a id="l453"></a>a great variety of motions regularly unequall. And after this he <a id="l454"></a>must further tell me why all objects appeare not of the same colour, <a id="l455"></a>that is why their colours in the Air where the rays that convey <a id="l456"></a>them every way are confusedly mixed, doe not assimilate one another <a id="l457"></a>&amp; become uniforme before they arrive at the Spectators eye.</p>
<p id="par33">But if there be yet any doubting, tis better to put the event <a id="l458"></a>on further <em class="underline">circumstances</em> of the <em class="underline">experiment</em>, then to acquiesce in <a id="l459"></a>the possibility of any Hypotheticall Explication. As for instance <a id="l460"></a>by trying what will be the apparition of these colours in a <a id="l461"></a>very quick consecution of one another. And this may be easily <a id="l462"></a>performed by the rapid gyration of a <em class="underline">wheel</em> with many spoakes <a id="l463"></a>or coggs in its perimeter, whose interstices &amp; thicknesses may be <a id="l464"></a>equall &amp; of such a largenesse that if the wheel be interposed <a id="l465"></a>between the Prism &amp; the white concourse of the colours, one <a id="l466"></a>half of the colours may be intercepted by a spoak or cogg <a id="l467"></a>&amp; the other halfe passe through an interstice. The wheel <a id="l468"></a>being in this posture you may first turne it slowly <a id="l469"></a>about to see all the colours fall successively on the same <a id="l470"></a>place of the paper held at their afforesaid concours, &amp; if <a id="l471"></a>you then accelerate its gyration untill the consecution of those <a id="l472"></a>colours be so quick that you cannot distinguish them severally, <a id="l473"></a>the resulting colour will be a whitenesse perfectly like that <a id="l474"></a>which an unrefracted beam of light exhibiteth when in like <a id="l475"></a>manner successively interrupted by the spoakes or Coggs of <a id="l476"></a>that circulating Wheel. And that this whitenesse is produced <a id="l477"></a>onely by a successive intermixture of the colours without <a id="l478"></a>their being assimilated or reduced to any uniformity, is <a id="l479"></a>certainly beyond all possibility of doubting, unlesse things that <a id="l480"></a>exist not at the same time may notwithstanding act on <a id="l481"></a>one another.</p>
<p id="par34">There are yet other circumstances by which the truth <a id="l482"></a>might have been decided, as by viewing the white concourse of <a id="l483"></a>the colours through another Prism placed close to the eye, <a id="l484"></a>by whose refraction that whitenesse may appeare again <a id="l485"></a>transformed into colours. And then to examin their origin, <a id="l486"></a>if an Assistant intercept any of the colours at the Lens <a id="l487"></a>before their arrivall at the whitenesse, the same colours <a id="l488"></a>will vanish from amongst those into which that whitenesse is <a id="l489"></a>converted by the second Prism, Now if the rays which disap<a id="l490"></a>peare be the same with those that are intercepted, then it <a id="l491"></a>must be acknowledged that the second Prism makes no new <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024v"> &lt;24v&gt; </span> colours in any rays which were not in them before their concours <a id="l492"></a>at the paper. Which is a plane indication that the rays of severall <a id="l493"></a>colours remain distinct from one another in the whitenesse, &amp; that <a id="l494"></a>from their previous dispositions are derived the colours of the <a id="l495"></a>second Prism. And by the way what is said of their colours <a id="l496"></a>may be applyed to their refrangibility.</p>
<p id="par35">The aforesaid <em class="underline">wheel</em> may be also here made use of; And <a id="l497"></a>if its gyration be neither too quick nor too slow, the succession <a id="l498"></a>of the colours may be discerned through the Prism, whilst to the <a id="l499"></a>naked eye of a By-stander they exhibit whitenesse.</p>
<p id="par36">There is something still remaining to be said of this <a id="l500"></a>Experiment. But this I conceive is enough to enforce it, &amp; so <a id="l501"></a>to decide the controversy. However I shall now proceed to sho <a id="l502"></a>some other ways of producing <em class="underline">whitenesse by mixtures</em>, since I <a id="l503"></a>perswade my selfe that this assertion above the rest appeares <a id="l504"></a><em class="underline">Paradoxicall</em>, &amp; is with most difficulty admitted. And because <a id="l505"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Hook desires an instance of it in bodies of divers colours, <a id="l506"></a>I shall begin with that. But in order thereto it must be <a id="l507"></a> considered that such coloured bodies reflect but some <a id="l508"></a>part of the light incident on them, as is evident by the 13<sup>th</sup> <a id="l509"></a>Proposition; &amp; therefore the light reflected from an aggregate <a id="l510"></a>of them will be much weakened by the losse of many rays. <a id="l511"></a>Whence a perfect &amp; intense whitenesse is not to be expected, <a id="l512"></a>but rather a colour between those of light &amp; shaddow, or <a id="l513"></a>such a grey or dirty colour as may be made by mixing <a id="l514"></a>white &amp; black together.</p>
<p id="par37">And that such a colour will result may be collected from <a id="l515"></a>the colour of <em class="underline">dust</em> found in every corner of a house, which hath <a id="l516"></a>been observed to consist of many coloured particles. There <a id="l517"></a>may be also produced the like dirty colour by mixing severall <a id="l518"></a><em class="underline">Painters colours</em> together. And the same may be effected <a id="l519"></a>by painting a <em class="underline">Top</em> (such as Boys play with) of divers colours; <a id="l520"></a>for when it is made to circulate by whipping it will appear <a id="l521"></a>of such a dirty colour.</p>
<p id="par38">Now the compounding of these colours is proper to my <a id="l522"></a>purpose because they differ not from whitenesse in the species <a id="l523"></a>of colour but onely in degree of luminousnesse. Which (did <a id="l524"></a>not M<sup>r</sup> Hook concede it) I might thus evince. A beam of the <a id="l525"></a>Suns light being transmitted into a darkened Room if you <a id="l526"></a>illuminate a sheet of white paper by that light reflected from <a id="l527"></a>a body of any colour the paper will always appeare of the <a id="l528"></a>colour of that body by whose reflected light it is illuminated. If it be <a id="l529"></a>a red body, the paper will be red; if a green body, it will be <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025r"> &lt;25r&gt; </span> green; &amp; so of the other colours. And the reason is that the <a id="l530"></a>fibers or threds of which the paper consists are all transparent &amp; <a id="l531"></a>specular, &amp; such substances are known to reflect colours without <a id="l532"></a>changing them. To know therefore to what species of colour <a id="l533"></a>a <em class="underline">Grey</em> belongeth, place any Grey body, (suppose a mixture of <a id="l534"></a>Painters colours) in the said light, &amp; the Paper being illumina<a id="l535"></a>ted by its reflexion shall appear <em class="underline">white</em>. And the same thing <a id="l536"></a>will happen if it be illuminated by reflexion from a <em class="underline">black</em> <a id="l537"></a>substance.</p>
<p id="par39">These therefore are all of one species, but yet they seem <a id="l538"></a>to be distinguished not onely by degrees of luminousnesse, but <a id="l539"></a>also by some other inequalities whereby they become more <a id="l540"></a>harsh or pleasant. And the distinction seems to be that Greys <a id="l541"></a>&amp; perhaps Black are made by an uneven defect of light, con<a id="l542"></a>sisting as it were of many little veines or streames which differ <a id="l543"></a>either in luminousnesse or in the unequall distribution of diversly <a id="l544"></a>coloured rays; such as ought to be caused by reflexion from <a id="l545"></a>a mixture of white &amp; black or of diversly coloured cor<a id="l546"></a>puscles. But when such imperfectly mixed light is by a second <a id="l547"></a>reflexion from the paper more evenly &amp; uniformely blended, <a id="l548"></a>it becomes more pleasant, &amp; exhibits a faint or shaddowed <a id="l549"></a>whitenesse. And that such little irregularities as these may cause <a id="l550"></a>these differences is not improbable if wee consider how much <a id="l551"></a>variety may be caused in sounds of the same tone by irre<a id="l552"></a>gular &amp; uneven jarrings. And besides, these differences <a id="l553"></a>are so little that I have sometimes doubted whether they be <a id="l554"></a>any at all, when I have considered that a black &amp; white body <a id="l555"></a>being placed together, the one in a strong light &amp; the other in a <a id="l556"></a>very faint light so proportioned that they might appear equally <a id="l557"></a>luminous; it hath been difficult to distinguish them when viewed at <a id="l558"></a>distance, unlesse when the Black seemed more blewish, &amp; the white <a id="l559"></a>body in a light still fainter hath in comparison of the black body <a id="l560"></a>it selfe appeared black.</p>
<p id="par40">This leads me to another way of compounding whitenesse; <a id="l561"></a>which is, that if four or five Bodies of the more eminent colours, <a id="l562"></a>or a paper painted all over  in severall parts of it with <a id="l563"></a>those severall colours in a due proportion, be placed in the said <a id="l564"></a>beam of light, the light reflected from those colours to another <a id="l565"></a>white paper held at a convenient distance shall make that <a id="l566"></a>paper appeare white. If it be h eld too neare the colours, its <a id="l567"></a>parts will seem of those colours which are nearest them, but by <a id="l568"></a>removing it further that all its parts may be equally illuminated <a id="l569"></a>by all the colours, they will be more &amp; more diluted untill they <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025v"> &lt;25v&gt; </span> become perfectly white. And you may further observe that if any of <a id="l570"></a>the colours be intercepted, the paper will no longer appeare white, but <a id="l571"></a>of the other colours which are not intercepted. Now that this whitenesse <a id="l572"></a>is a mixture of the severally coloured rays falling confusedly on the <a id="l573"></a>Paper, I see no reason to doubt of, because if the light became <a id="l574"></a>uniforme &amp; similar before it fell on the paper, it must much more <a id="l575"></a>be uniforme when at a greater distance it falls on the spectators <a id="l576"></a>eye; &amp; so the rays which come from severall colours would in no <a id="l577"></a>qualities differ from one another, but all of them exhibit the same <a id="l578"></a>colour to the Spectator, contrary to what he sees.</p>
<p id="par41">Not much unlike this instance it is that if a polished piece of <a id="l579"></a>Metall be so placed that the colours appear in it as in a looking-<a id="l580"></a>glasse, &amp; then the metall be made rough that by a confused reflexi<a id="l581"></a>on those apparent colours may be blended together, they shall dis<a id="l582"></a>appear, &amp; by their mixture cause the Metall to look white.</p>
<p id="par42">But further to enforce this experiment, if instead of the <a id="l583"></a>paper any white froth consisting of small bubbles be illuminated by <a id="l584"></a>reflexion from the afforesaid colours, it shall to the naked eye <a id="l585"></a>seem white, &amp; yet through a good Microscope the severall colours <a id="l586"></a>will appear distinct on the Bubbles as if seen by reflexion from <a id="l587"></a>so many sphericall surfaces. With my naked eye being very neare <a id="l588"></a>I have also discerned the severall colours on each Bubble, &amp; <a id="l589"></a>yet at a greater distance where I could not distinguish them apart, <a id="l590"></a>the Froth hath appeared intirely white. And at the same distance <a id="l591"></a>when I looked intently I have seen the colours distinctly on each <a id="l592"></a>Bubble, &amp; yet by straining my eyes as if I would look at some<a id="l593"></a>thing far of beyond them, thereby to render the vision confused, <a id="l594"></a>the Froth hath appeared without any other colour then whitenesse. <a id="l595"></a>And what is here said of froth may easily be understood of the <a id="l596"></a>Paper or Metall in the foregoing Experiments. For their parts <a id="l597"></a>are specular bodies like these Bubbles: &amp; perhaps with an excellent <a id="l598"></a> Microscope the colours may be also seen intermixedly <a id="l599"></a>reflected from them.</p>
<p id="par43">In proportioning the severally coloured Bodies to produce these <a id="l600"></a>effects there may be some nicenesse, &amp; it will be more conve<a id="l601"></a>nient to make use of the colours of the Prism cast on a wall <a id="l602"></a>by whose reflexion the Paper, Metall, Froth, &amp; other white sub<a id="l603"></a>stances may be illuminated. And I usually made my tryalls this <a id="l604"></a>way because I could  better exclude any scattering light from <a id="l605"></a>mixing with the colours to dilute them.</p>
<p id="par44">To this way of compounding whitenesse may be referred <a id="l606"></a>that other by mixing light after it hath been trajected through <a id="l607"></a>transparently coloured substances. For instance if no light be <a id="l608"></a>admitted into a Room but onely through coloured Glasse whose <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span> severall parts are of severall colours in a pretty equall proportion: <a id="l609"></a>all white things in the Room shall appear white if they be not held <a id="l610"></a>too near the Glasse. And yet this light with which they are illu<a id="l611"></a>minated cannot possibly be uniforme, because if the rays which at <a id="l612"></a>their entrance are of divers colours, do in their progresse through <a id="l613"></a>the Room suffer any alteration to be reduced to an uniformity: the <a id="l614"></a>Glasse would not in the remotest parts of the Room appear of <a id="l615"></a>the very same colour which it doth when the Spectators eye is <a id="l616"></a>very near it. Nor would the rays when transmitted into another <a id="l617"></a>dark Room through a little hole in an opposite Door or partition <a id="l618"></a>Wall, project on a Paper the species or representation of the <a id="l619"></a>Glasse in its proper colours</p>
<p id="par45">And by the way this seems a very fit &amp; cogent instance of <a id="l620"></a>some other parts of my Theory, &amp; particularly of the 13<sup>th</sup> <a id="l621"></a>Proposition. For in this Room all naturall bodies whatever appear <a id="l622"></a>of their proper colours. And all the Phænomena of colours in <a id="l623"></a>nature made either by refraction or without it are here the <a id="l624"></a>same as in the open Air. Now the light in this Room being <a id="l625"></a>such a dissimilar mixture as I have described in my Theory, <a id="l626"></a>the causes of all these Phænomena must be the same that I <a id="l627"></a>have there assigned. And I see no reason to suspect that the <a id="l628"></a>same Phænomena should have other causes in the open Air.</p>
<p id="par46">The successe of this Experiment may be easily conjectured <a id="l629"></a>by the appearances of things in a <em class="underline">Church</em> or <em class="underline">Chappell</em> whose windows <a id="l630"></a>are of coloured Glasse; or in the open Air when it is illustrated <a id="l631"></a>with clouds of various colours.</p>
<p id="par47">There are yet other ways by which I have produced <a id="l632"></a>whitenesse, as by casting severall colours from two or more Prisms <a id="l633"></a>upon the same place, by refracting a beam of light with two <a id="l634"></a>or three Prisms successively to make the diverging colours con<a id="l635"></a>verge again, by reflecting one colour to another, &amp; by looking <a id="l636"></a>through a Prism on an Object of many colours; &amp;, which is <a id="l637"></a>equivalent to M<sup>r</sup> Hooks way of mixing colours by concave wedges <a id="l638"></a>filled with coloured liquors, I have observed the shaddows of a <a id="l639"></a>painted glasse-window to become white where those of many <a id="l640"></a>colours have at a great distance interfered. But yet for fur<a id="l641"></a>ther satisfaction  he may try, if he please, the effects of <a id="l642"></a>four or five such wedges filled with liquors of as many severall <a id="l643"></a>colours.</p>
<p id="par48"> Besides all these, the colours of water-bubbles, &amp; other <a id="l644"></a>thin pellucid substances afford severall instances of whitenesse <a id="l645"></a>produced by their mixture; with one of which I shall conclude this <a id="l646"></a>Particular. Let some water in which a convenient quantity of Soap <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026v"> &lt;26v&gt; </span> or wash-ball is dissolved, be agitated into a Froth, &amp; after that Froth <a id="l647"></a>hath stood a whole without further agitation till you see the <a id="l648"></a>Bubbles of which it consists begin to break, there will appear a great <a id="l649"></a>variety of colours all over the top of every Bubble if you view <a id="l650"></a>them near at hand, but if you view them at so great a distance <a id="l651"></a>that you cannot distinguish the colours one from another, the froth <a id="l652"></a>will appear perfectly white.</p>
<p id="par49"><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup>Thus much concerning the <em class="underline">designe</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Substance</em> of M<sup>r</sup> Hooks <a id="l653"></a><em class="underline">Considerations</em>. There are yet some particulars to be taken <a id="l654"></a>notice of; as the denyall of the <em class="underline">Experimentum Crucis</em>. On this <a id="l655"></a>I chose to lay the whole stresse of my discourse, which therefore <a id="l656"></a>was the principall thing to have been objected against. But I <a id="l657"></a>cannot be convinced of its insufficiency by a bare denyall with<a id="l658"></a>out assigning a reason for it. I am apt to beleive it hath <a id="l659"></a>been misunderstood. For otherwise it would have prevented <a id="l660"></a>the discourses about rarefying &amp; splitting of rays, because the <a id="l661"></a>designe of it is to show that rays of divers colours considered <a id="l662"></a>apart do at equall incidences suffer unequal refractions, with<a id="l663"></a>out being split, rarefied, or any ways dilated.</p>
<p id="par50"><sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup>In the Considerations on my first &amp; second Propositions M<sup>r</sup> Hook <a id="l664"></a>hath rendered my Doctrin of unequall refrangibility very imper<a id="l665"></a>fect &amp; maimed by explicating it wholly by the splitting of <a id="l666"></a>rays, whereas I chiefly intended it in those refractions which <a id="l667"></a>are performed without that supposed irregularity; such as the <a id="l668"></a>Experimentum Crucis might have informed him of. And in <a id="l669"></a>generall I find that whilst he hath endeavoured to explicate <a id="l670"></a>my Propositions Hypothetically, the more materiall suggesti<a id="l671"></a>ons by which I designed to recommend them, have escaped his considera<a id="l672"></a>tion; such as are the unchangeablenesse of the degree of refran<a id="l673"></a>gibility peculiar to any sort of rays, the strict Analogy <a id="l674"></a>between the degrees of refrangibility &amp; colours, the distinction <a id="l675"></a>between compounded &amp; uncompounded colours, the unchangeable<a id="l676"></a>nesse of uncompounded colours, &amp; the assertion that if any one <a id="l677"></a>of the Prismatique colours be wholly intercepted, that colour <a id="l678"></a>cannot be new produced out of the remaining light by any <a id="l679"></a>further refraction or reflexion whatsoever. And of what <a id="l680"></a>strength &amp; efficacy these particulars are for enforcing the Theory <a id="l681"></a>I desire therefore may be now considered.<sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup></p>
<p id="par51"><sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup>In the last place I should take notice of a casuall expression <a id="l682"></a>which intimates a greater certainty in these things then I ever <a id="l683"></a>promised. viz: The certainty of <em class="underline">Mathematicall Demonstrations</em>. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027r"> &lt;27r&gt; </span> I said indeed that the <em class="underline">Science of Colours was Mathematicall <a id="l684"></a>&amp; as certain as any other part of Optiques</em>; but who knows <a id="l685"></a>not that Optiques &amp; many other Mathematicall Sciences depend <a id="l686"></a>as well on Physicall Principles as on Mathematicall Demonstra<a id="l687"></a>tions: And the absolute certainty of a Science cannot exceed <a id="l688"></a>the certainty of its Principles. Now the evidence by which I <a id="l689"></a>asserted the Propositions of colours is in the next words expressed <a id="l690"></a>to be from <em class="underline">Experiments</em> &amp; so but <em class="underline">Physicall</em>: Whence the Pro<a id="l691"></a>positions themselves can be esteemed no more then <em class="underline">Physicall <a id="l692"></a>Principles</em> of a Science. And if those Principles be such <a id="l693"></a>that on them a Mathematician may determin all the Phæno<a id="l694"></a>mena of colours that can be caused by refractions, &amp; that by <a id="l695"></a>computing or demonstrating after what manner &amp; how much <a id="l696"></a>those refractions doe separate or mingle the rays in which se<a id="l697"></a>verall colours are originally inherent; I suppose the <em class="underline">Science <a id="l698"></a>of Colours</em> will be granted <em class="underline">Mathematicall</em> &amp; as certain as any <a id="l699"></a>part of <em class="underline">Optiques</em>.
