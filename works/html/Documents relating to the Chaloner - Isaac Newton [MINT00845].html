<p id="par1" class="cent">To the Honourable the Knights Citizens &amp; Burgesses in Parliament assembled <a id="l1"></a><br>the humble Petition of William Chaloner Gent. Sheweth</p>
    
    <p id="par2">That your Petitioner did in the last sessions of Parliament<sup>1</sup> discover several <a id="l2"></a>abuses committed in the Mint &amp;<sup>2</sup> shewed by what methods false money was <a id="l3"></a>coyned,<sup>3</sup> that laws might more effectually be made  to prevent the same <a id="l4"></a>&amp; severall Acts were accordingly made against it, &amp;<sup>4</sup> then some of the Mint <a id="l5"></a>threatned by some means to prosecute him &amp; take away his life <a id="l6"></a>before the next sessions of Parliament,<sup>5</sup> telling him that this Honourable <a id="l7"></a>House had no power to meddle with the affairs of the Mint. therefore <a id="l8"></a>they would not obey the Order made by a Committee of this Honourable House</p>
    
    <p id="par3">That the said Committee5 promised your Petitioner he should suffer no dam<a id="l9"></a>mage for his discoveries about the Mint &amp; by the directions of this Honourable <a id="l10"></a>House a member thereof did represent his case to the King &amp; his Majesty <a id="l11"></a>was pleased to say that he should suffer no dammage for the said <a id="l12"></a>matters, yet they committed him to Newgate &amp; kept him in Irons <a id="l13"></a>for seven weeks alledging that he had abused the Mint in Parliament &amp; <a id="l14"></a>they did falsly &amp; illegally preferr a bill of Indictment against him <a id="l15"></a>but could bring no evidence against him to prove it altho they <a id="l16"></a>used strange methods to procure something.  For many <a id="l17"></a>witnesses have made oath before a Iudge of the Kings Bench &amp; <a id="l18"></a>some Iustices of  peace, that some of the Mint have imployed <a id="l19"></a>&amp; given Privilege to several persons to coyn false money who <a id="l20"></a>put it away among the subjects for good all which was done <a id="l21"></a>with an intent to draw him into coyning to take his life away <a id="l22"></a>&amp; the better to effect the same they allowed the said persons money <a id="l23"></a>from time to time to buy tools &amp; to carry on the said conspiracy <a id="l24"></a>against your  Petitioners life. But all their endeavours could not <a id="l25"></a>get him to be concerned in coyning, but on the contrary he <a id="l26"></a>hath made it his business for a considerable time past to find out <a id="l27"></a>the Treasons &amp; Conspiracies against the King &amp; Kingdome &amp; <a id="l28"></a>thereby hath discovered many who have been convicted for the <a id="l29"></a>same, &amp; was this year writing a book of the present state of <a id="l30"></a>the Mint &amp; the defects thereof (as he promised the said Committee) <a id="l31"></a>which he hoped would have been of service to the publick. But <a id="l32"></a>the Mint having notice of it they committed him to <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>Newgate<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Prison <a id="l33"></a>&amp; so prevented him from doing it. All which can be proved if this <a id="l34"></a>honourable House is pleased to require it.</p>
    
<p id="par4">That your Petitioner is utterly ruined by his endeavours to serve the King <a id="l35"></a>&amp; Kingdom &amp; by his discoveries against the Mint to this Honourable House</p>
    
<p id="par5">Your Petitioner therefore most humbly plays that this Honourable House will <a id="l36"></a>be pleased to consider his great sufferings &amp; ruined condition as <a id="l37"></a>being incapable of providing for himself &amp; family by what he <a id="l38"></a>intended for the service of the Publick &amp; grant him such redress <a id="l39"></a>as shall seem best in your Honours great Wisdom &amp; Iustice</p>
    
<p id="par6" class="i20">And your Petitioner shall ever pray &amp;c</p>

<span class="pagenumber" id="p497v"> &lt;497v&gt; </span>
    
<p id="par8" class="cent">An Answer to Mr Chaloner's Petition.</p>
    
<p id="par9">M<sup>r</sup> Chaloner before a Committee of the last sessions of Parliament <a id="l40"></a>laboured to accuse &amp; vilify the Mint &amp; approve himself a more <a id="l41"></a>skilfull coyner then they that he might be made their supervisor <a id="l42"></a>&amp; then supply Tho. Holloway with Tools out of the Tower to <a id="l43"></a>counterfeit his own milled money by a way which he then concealed <a id="l44"></a>from that Honourable Committee, boasting secretly that he would fun the <a id="l45"></a> Parliament as he had done the King &amp; Bank before. And while he was <a id="l46"></a>upon this designe I gave the Chairman of that Honourable Committee <a id="l47"></a>minutes for a new Act of Parliament against Coyners &amp; the Act was <a id="l48"></a>afterwards drawn up by some of the Iudges &amp; Officers of the <a id="l49"></a>Mint &amp; brought into the House of Lords without M<sup>r</sup> Chaloners assistance.</p>
    
<p id="par10">About the end of that Sessions M<sup>r</sup> Neale (as I have heard) <a id="l50"></a>moved the House to give leave that M<sup>r</sup> Chaloner might be prosecu<a id="l51"></a>ted for taxing the Mint with coyning great quantities of false money <a id="l52"></a>but I do not know that there was any designe or menace to <a id="l53"></a>prosecute him for anything else then that calumny &amp; much less to <a id="l54"></a>take away his life. Nor did I ever hear any one pretend that <a id="l55"></a>the Honourable House of Commons had no power to meddle with the <a id="l56"></a>Affairs of the Mint or that their Committee which then sat had not <a id="l57"></a>all the power which the House thought fit to give them: but when <a id="l58"></a>the Committee sent an order to me about preparing an Edger for <a id="l59"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Chaloner to grove new money, I told M<sup>r</sup> Chaloner that in <a id="l60"></a>regard of an Oath which I had taken I could not safely carry him <a id="l61"></a>to the Workmen of the Mint about it, but if he would give me <a id="l62"></a>directions I would take care of the matter; but M<sup>r</sup> Chaloner refusing <a id="l63"></a>to give me directions (as he ought to have done by that Order I <a id="l64"></a>directed the workmen (without him) to grove some half crowns <a id="l65"></a>shillings &amp; sixpences &amp; carried them to the Committee.</p>
    
<p id="par11">That his Majesty by order of this Honourable House was now moved in <a id="l66"></a>behalf of M<sup>r</sup> Chaloner I did not hear till after I had committed him <a id="l67"></a>which I  was moved to do because he stood charged with new designes <a id="l68"></a>of counterfeiting Bills &amp; Money forreign &amp; domestick. And particularly <a id="l69"></a>upon the rising of the last sessions of Parliament he advised Tho. <a id="l70"></a>Holloway to take a house in the Country convenient for coyning &amp; <a id="l71"></a>agreed with him that he should find materials &amp; teach Holloway <a id="l72"></a>to coyn &amp; Holloway &amp; his brother Iohn should coyn together at <a id="l73"></a>that house &amp; they three should share the money so made. And <a id="l74"></a>accordingly Tho. Holloway did take a house at Egham in Surrey &amp; <a id="l75"></a>Chaloner did make some progress in teaching him &amp; his brother <a id="l76"></a>&amp; in preparing coyning tools, &amp; for doing this &amp; having coyned very <a id="l77"></a>great summs of Gold &amp; not for offending the Mint he was committed <a id="l78"></a>&amp; prosecuted. But the principal witness fled into Scotland &amp; the Indict<a id="l79"></a>ment being drawn wrong two others of the Witnesses were afterwards <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p498r"> &lt;498r&gt; </span>drawn off to swear against it &amp; against the Mint, altho by swearing <a id="l80"></a>on both sides their credit fell &amp; to draw off the Kings witnesses &amp; <a id="l81"></a> swear them against the King gravells prosecutions &amp; renders it dan<a id="l82"></a>gerous for any man to prosecute &amp; is therefore accounted a mis<a id="l83"></a>demeanour.</p>
    
<p id="par12">There are divers witnesses that M<sup>r</sup> Chaloner last spring &amp; <a id="l84"></a>Summer was forward to coyn &amp; I do not know or beleieve that any <a id="l85"></a>privilege or direction was given by any of the Mint to draw him <a id="l86"></a>or his confederates in or that any conspiracy was made against <a id="l87"></a>him or any money given to buy coyning tools. Neither can I <a id="l88"></a>find that he did ever make it his business to find out any trea<a id="l89"></a>sons or conspiracies against the King &amp; Kingdom but what were <a id="l90"></a>of his own contriving, as in the case of the Printers. And as <a id="l91"></a>for his intended book about the Mint I heard nothing of it <a id="l92"></a>till I saw it mentioned in his printed case &amp; therefore did not <a id="l93"></a>commit him for that book. When I had committed him he told <a id="l94"></a>me he had written a book about preventing the counterfeiting <a id="l95"></a>of Bills &amp; offered to let me see it, but said nothing of any <a id="l96"></a>book intended by him about the Mint.</p>
    
<p id="par13">If therefore he be ruined tis by his endeavouring not to <a id="l97"></a>serve the King &amp; Government as he pretends but to coyn false <a id="l98"></a>money. And if he would but let the money &amp; Government alone &amp; return <a id="l99"></a>to his trade of Japanning, he is not so far ruined but that <a id="l100"></a>he may still live as well as he did seven years ago when <a id="l101"></a>he left of that trade &amp; raised himself by coyning.</p>
