<p id="par12">Dacia was a large country bounded – – – – Christian religion among them <a id="l62"></a>was much promoted. [ The chief inhabitants were the Goths called Ostrogoths &amp; Visigoths &amp; <a id="l63"></a>other Gothic nations called  Vandals,  Gepides;  Lombards &amp;c  ]  .  They were composed of several Gothic nations which <a id="l64"></a>came originally from the southern parts of Scanozia or Scandinavia a great Peninsula in the Baltick sea <a id="l65"></a>conteining Norway &amp; most of Sweden, &amp; reputed an Island by the ancients  Whence it came to pass that they all spake the same language &amp; agreed in their manners <a id="l67"></a>Paulus Diaconus in his Historia Miscella lib.

<p id="par13">The Goths for want of their pay revolted from the Romans <a id="l70"></a>under their King Ostrogotha in the second year of the Emperor <a id="l71"></a>Philip, &amp; being assisted by the Thaphili, Astringi  ( or Vandals )  &amp; Carpi ( other <a id="l72"></a>Gothick nations, ) made war upon the Romans .

And the Emperor Aurelian about the year 272  ( as Vopiscus tells us )  : cum vasta<a id="l81"></a>tum Illyricum &amp; Mœsiam deperditam videret, provinciam trans Danubium <a id="l82"></a>Daciam a Trajano constitutam sublato exercitu &amp; provincialibus reliquit, <a id="l83"></a>desperans eam posse retineri: abductos ex ea populos in Mœsiam collo<a id="l84"></a>cavit appellavit suam Daciam.

And by these  events the  Empire began to be divided into <a id="l88"></a>the three parts touched upon in the Apocalyps, the eastern Empire, the <a id="l89"></a>western, &amp; that of the Goths.</p>

Theod. l 4 c 37. And this  religion  they derived from the seven Churches of Asia. These two Churches <a id="l318"></a>were very remarkable witnesses against – – – – – – – – – character of the <a id="l319"></a>two witnesses. In the end of the wars of those four Trumpets when the <a id="l320"></a>kingdom of the Ostrogoths fell &amp; the kings of the Visigoth<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> embraced the <a id="l321"></a>Roman Catholick religion, these witnesses put on sackcloth. But they began <a id="l322"></a>to prophesy before. For  they had power to shut heaven <a id="l323"></a>that it should not rain in the days of their prophesy, &amp; therefore they <a id="l324"></a>began to prophesy when the rain ceased &amp; the woman fled into the spiritually dry &amp; baren wilderness, &amp; left a <a id="l325"></a>remnant of her seed  ( the remnant of the seven Churches )  to be persecuted in the eastern Empire by the Dragon. <a id="l326"></a>They were the Candlesticks of the second Temple &amp; therefore prophesied from the time of measuring or building that Temple As the seven Churches of Asia were not all the Churches of Asia but <a id="l327"></a>were chosen to represent them all, so the two  Churches  of the <a id="l328"></a>Goths  might not be all the Churches of God in the western Empire but for <a id="l329"></a>their eminence  might be chosen to represent them all. And as the seven Candlesticks or Churches <a id="l330"></a>  of Asia after the flight of the woman into <a id="l333"></a>the wilderness signifie the remnant of her seed which she left in the eastern <a id="l334"></a>Empire   when she fled &amp; which the Dragon went to make war upon when he turned from pursuing her,  &amp; the remnant of that remnant <a id="l335"></a>   after the Dragon had made war upon them   <a id="l337"></a>so the two Witnesses after they put on sackcloth signify  the <a id="l338"></a>remnant of all the true Christians in the western Empire in a state of <a id="l339"></a>affliction mourning &amp; oppression. And in this disconsolate condition the people <a id="l340"></a>of God continue in both Empires till the  fall of  Babylon <a id="l341"></a>the great,  the preaching of the Gospel to all nations, &amp; the second <a id="l342"></a>coming of Christ. </p>
