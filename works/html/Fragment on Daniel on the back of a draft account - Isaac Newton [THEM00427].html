<p id="par8">A little before the death of Philopator his son Demetrius was sent hostage <a id="l44"></a>to Rome  in the  place of Antiochus Epiphanes   the brother of Philopator  &amp; Antiochus was at Athens <a id="l45"></a> in his way home when Philopator died.

<p id="par9">&amp; therefore in these few words <em class="underline">&amp; after him arms shall stand up</em> ,  he comprehends all the succesive conquests by which the Romans  extended their dominion over <a id="l47"></a>the Greeks &amp; from the  last of those conquests which was the conquest of Egypt, he steps  down to <a id="l48"></a>the next action of great note   within the dominions of the Gre<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ee<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ks, which was the war against the Iews the taking <a id="l49"></a>away  worship, &amp; setting up the heathen Idols  throughout all  Iudea &amp;  dispersing <a id="l50"></a>the people into all nations  .   This Daniel calls the setting up of the abomination <a id="l51"></a>of desolation,  or the setting up of the abomination which maketh  the land desolate <a id="l52"></a>  This was the setting up of idolatry not in the temple <a id="l53"></a>alone but in all the cities &amp; towns of Iudea &amp; compelling all the inhabitants to  worship <a id="l54"></a>them or fly their country. Such an abomination Antiochus endeavoured to set up but  without success. The abomination which he set up did not make the land desolate . Such an abomination  was effectually set up by the <a id="l56"></a>Romans.  They &amp; they alone set it up with success <a id="l57"></a>&amp; ever since they set it up the land has continued desolate &amp; empty of its people <a id="l58"></a>the Iews as we see at this day. </p>
<p id="par10"> Thus all things came to pass as Daniel had foretold, and <a id="l59"></a>this destroying the city &amp; sanctuary by the Romans &amp; causing desolations in the land untill the end of the war,  &amp;  making the daily  sacrifice to cease &amp; <a id="l60"></a>overspreading the land with a wing of abominations  <a id="l61"></a> &amp; thereby making it desolate unto the end of the indignation is a full <a id="l62"></a>explication of what Daniel in other places calls  taking away the daily <a id="l63"></a>sacrifice &amp; setting up the abomination of desolation. </p>
<p id="par11"> Before this desolation the Iews – – – who were thereby grafted into the stock <a id="l64"></a>of the Iews &amp;  became Gods people till the abomination of desolation <a id="l65"></a>was set up also in their churches. </p>

For  dictating laws in matters of <a id="l67"></a>revealed religion is usurping divine authority  &amp;  sitting in Gods throne, or as the <a id="l68"></a>Apostle Paul expresseth,  it is exalting himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp; at<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> that he as God sitteth in the Temple of God shewing himself that <a id="l69"></a>he is  God.

<p id="par15">Thus the Empire of the Greeks  is by Daniel  <a id="l93"></a>distinguished into several successive periods.

This third is distinguished into two principal parts  <a id="l122"></a>   of which preceded the time of the end &amp; the  other is called the time <a id="l123"></a>of the end.  In the first the religion of the Moncks grew up &amp;  <a id="l124"></a>ware out the saints &amp; became universal. In The second  the <a id="l125"></a>kings of the South &amp; north  rose <span class="gap" title="Illegible text (Extent: 1 character)">{illeg}</span> up &amp; made war upon the Greek Empire, &amp; <a id="l126"></a>therefore the time of the end begins with the rise of the  Empire of the Saracens. <a id="l127"></a> In the first the religion of the Moncks proceeded to the  <a id="l145"></a> invocation of Mahuzzims which was a breach of the first commandment. In <a id="l146"></a>the second it proceeded to the  setting up  images to the Mahuzzims &amp; venera<a id="l147"></a>ting the Images which was a breach of the second commandment .   <a id="l148"></a>    </p>

<p id="par17">In the first the Mosaical daily sacrifice continues without interruption. In the second <a id="l157"></a>it is taken away &amp; the true worship remains only among the Christians. In the third the <a id="l158"></a>primitive Christianity is succeeded by the religion of the Moncks. In the fourth the <a id="l159"></a>abomination of desolation reigns. </p>
<p id="par18"> Thus Daniel has described by steps, all the  chief actions &amp; revolu<a id="l160"></a>tions in the  Empire of the Persians &amp; Greeks down from his own days <a id="l161"></a>to ours &amp; in doing this  he has distinguished the times into five  <a id="l162"></a>cardinal periods. The first of the reign of the Persians, the second <a id="l163"></a>is of the reign of the Greeks alone until the Romans began to conquer <a id="l164"></a>them the third is of the rise &amp; reign of the Romans over the Greeks until <a id="l165"></a>the division of their Empire into the Empires of the Greeks &amp; Latines <a id="l166"></a>the fourth is of the Greek Empire at Constantinople after separation from the Latines <a id="l167"></a>untill the rise &amp; reigne of the Mahometans  &amp; the fift is of the <a id="l168"></a>Mahometans reigning successively in the South &amp; north &amp; making warr upon the Greeks.  <a id="l169"></a> And the four last periods are distinguished from one another by saying between the  second <a id="l170"></a>&amp;  third &amp; again between the third &amp; fourth that the end is yet at  <a id="l171"></a>at a time appointed &amp; calling the fift the time of the end. The third be<a id="l172"></a>gan with the practises against the daily sacrifice of the Iews, the fourth with <a id="l173"></a>the rise of the religion of the Moncks &amp; fift with the rise of the religion <a id="l174"></a>of the Mahometans. In the third the heathen abomination  was set up in <a id="l175"></a>all Iudea. In the fourth the Monkish abomination of invoking Saints,  which is a breach of <a id="l176"></a>the first commandment, was set up in the Christian Churches  in all the Empire. In the fift the Monks <a id="l177"></a>abomination of worshipping Images, which is a breach of the second commandment,  <a id="l178"></a> was also set up  <a id="l179"></a> in all the Empire .       <a id="l180"></a>   <a id="l181"></a> And these abominations made a desolation of Gods  people wherever <a id="l182"></a>they were set up.  In Iudea  the heathen abomination made a desolation  of the  <a id="l183"></a>Iews,  the believing Iews flying their country &amp; the unbelieving being slaughtered <a id="l184"></a>&amp; expelled. In Christendom the  Monkish abomination wore out the saints &amp; made a desolation <a id="l185"></a>of all Gods people &amp;  The first act against the holy covenant was in autumn in the <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Iudaic<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> year of Seleucus 143 ( 1 Maccab. 1.20 ) when Antiochus spoiled the Temple.  the last act of setting up the abomination was in  the year of Christ 842  <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>toward<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the end of the Iudaic year of Seleucus  1153 when a Council called at Constantinople by the Empress Theodora <a id="l187"></a>decreed that Images which had been condemned &amp; thrown down  by some former Emperors should be set <a id="l188"></a>up again  &amp; venerated as before  <a id="l189"></a>&amp; an annuall festival was instituted on Febr. 11 in memory of their restitution.   and that the difference between these periods being 1010 Iudaic years is the same with <a id="l191"></a>the difference between the 2300 &amp; the 1290   days putting a <a id="l192"></a>prophetic day for a Iudaic year</p>
