Every <a id="l5"></a>city with its villages was a polity (as the very word still signifies) &amp; every <a id="l6"></a>polity a sovereign kingdom,   untill conquest introduced subordination of  governments. <a id="l8"></a> Every father at first was a king.

And with this war &amp; the reign of the <a id="l21"></a>sons of Chus  in their several territories <a id="l22"></a>began the iron age.

[So then the first parents <a id="l36"></a>were  soveraign kings &amp; their kingdoms were no greater then their <a id="l37"></a>families. Every family was a kingdom till  several families <a id="l38"></a>for want of more room to spread into began to live together in <a id="l39"></a>the same town &amp; then  the commerce between the families made it necessary for ending all differences that their fathers  <a id="l40"></a>should appoint some one of their number to  moderate &amp;   judge between them all &amp; do the office of <a id="l42"></a>a common father: &amp; thus the first towns became cities &amp; king<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span>doms &amp; the fathers of families which had hitherto been kings became <a id="l43"></a>elders of cities, &amp; the towns which grew up afterwards with in the <a id="l44"></a>territories of any  citty became the villages of the city.

<p id="par3">The  Kingdom &amp; City of Babylon was founded by <a id="l86"></a>Nebonassar  an Assyrian about 34 years before the de<a id="l87"></a>fection of the Medes, &amp; peopled with Arabians collected <a id="l88"></a>thither into a body from the neighbouring regions (Isa. <a id="l89"></a>23.13) These Arabians seem to be of the posterity <a id="l90"></a>of Chavilah the son of Chus. For his seat    compassed Babylon on the south &amp; west, lying  in the way from Egypt <a id="l92"></a>to Assyria &amp; extending from the Persian gulf &amp; mouth of the Pasitigris or Pison to the south-western elbow of the Euphrates Gen 2.11 &amp; 25.18. 1 Sam. 15.7.)  These Ara<a id="l93"></a>bians the Greeks &amp; Latines called Chaulotæans whence <a id="l94"></a>perhaps the name of Chaldæans was given  to those in <a id="l95"></a> Babylonia.  But  the kings of Babylon were Assyrians &amp; Medes <a id="l98"></a>till the reign of Cyrus as appears by the title of  Ptolo<a id="l99"></a>mies Canon of them. Whence  Nabonadius the last of the Kings of that Canon  was a Mede &amp;  by consequence is the same with Darius <a id="l101"></a>the Mede.  For the rest were Assyrians unless you will  add also <a id="l102"></a> the last but one to with Medes.  In the 68<sup>th</sup> year of their kingdom Assarhaddon <a id="l105"></a>king of Assyria became king also of Babylon,  <a id="l106"></a>&amp; reigned over both kingdoms thirteen years.  <a id="l107"></a>  &amp; soon after  <a id="l110"></a>happened the war between the kingdomes of the Medes &amp; <a id="l111"></a>Assyrians &amp; the invasion  / of Asia by the Scythians, upon which occa<a id="l112"></a>sions I conceive it was that the kingdom of Babylon <a id="l113"></a>became again divided from the kingdom of Assyria.

Then to Darius the Mede <a id="l163"></a>whom they reccon the first King of the Medo-Persian <a id="l164"></a>Empire they ascribe but  one year or at most but two <a id="l165"></a>(Dan. 9.1) to Cyrus three years incomplete (Dan. 10.1) <a id="l166"></a>to Ahashuerus 12 years till the casting of Pur (Esth. <a id="l167"></a>3.7) one year more till the Iews smote their enemies <a id="l168"></a>(ch. 9.1) &amp; one year more till Esther &amp; Mordecai wrote <a id="l169"></a>the second letter for the keeping of Purim (ch. 9.29) <a id="l170"></a>in all 14 years, &amp; &amp; so reccon 70 years also from the  destruction of the Temple &amp; City to the second year of Darius Zach. 1.1, 12 to Darius the Persian they allot  <a id="l171"></a>above 32 years (Nehem 13.6) recconing that the Per<a id="l172"></a>sian Monarchy during the standing of the second Temple flourished <a id="l173"></a>only 34 years, untill Alexander the great overthrew <a id="l174"></a>it. Thus the Iews reccon in their great Chronicle <a id="l175"></a>calle Seder Olam Rabba. Whence its plain that we <a id="l176"></a>are to expect little or no light from them in the history of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003v"> &lt;3v&gt; </span> these kingdoms but must have recourse to the scriptures themselves <a id="l177"></a>compare them with the records of the Greeks.</p>

<p id="par17">At the captivity of the 10 tribes the Medes were subject to the King of Assyria (2 King17.6) but   but a little after when Sennacherib lost his army in Iudea &amp; returning back to Ninive was slain by his sons, The  Kingdom of the Medes was  originally a branch of the Assyrian Monarchy. At first it was of no very great extent. The first king who began to enlarge the kingdom was Phraortes.  He conquered the Persians &amp; made war upon the King of Assyria &amp; took Susa from him but was slain in battel. His son <a id="l301"></a>Cyaxeres pursuing the war beseiged Ninive in the be<a id="l302"></a>ginning of his reign but in the seige was opprest by a <a id="l303"></a>great inundation of Scythians who from that time reigned <a id="l304"></a>over Media for 28 years together, but then  Cyaxeres inviting them to a feast slew them <a id="l306"></a>in drink &amp; having recovered his kingdom  <a id="l307"></a>renewed the war against  the king of Assyria &amp; by the <a id="l308"></a>assistance of Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Nineve as above. <a id="l309"></a> Ctesias &amp; Alexander Polyhistor call him Astirbares that is Astivares or Assueris. For he is that Assuerus who with Nebuchadnezzar conquered Ninive ( Tobit. 14.15) &amp; whose younger son Darius succeeded Belshazz in the Kingdom of Babylon. He reigned 40 years &amp; Astyages   his eldest son reigned after him, <a id="l310"></a>  38 years according to Eusebius &amp; Syncellus, or 40 according <a id="l311"></a>to a  canon printer by Scaliger in the 2<sup>d</sup> book of <a id="l312"></a>his Isagogical canons, &amp; then  was conquered by Cyrus  <a id="l313"></a> in the 189<sup>th</sup> year in the 189<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonassar.  For the 30 <a id="l316"></a>years reign of Cyrus are dated from this conquest. Subduct <a id="l317"></a>the 80 years reign of Cyaxeres &amp; Astyages, &amp; the  beginning of the reign of Cyaxeres &amp;  inundation of the Scythians will <a id="l319"></a>be in the 109<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonassar &amp; the slaughter of <a id="l320"></a>the Scythians in the 137<sup>th</sup> year &amp; the  ruin of Ninive <a id="l321"></a>a year or two after will fall on the first or 2<sup>d</sup> <a id="l322"></a>year of Iehojakim's reign as  it ought <a id="l323"></a>to do by the history thereof given above. The Kingdom <a id="l324"></a>of the Medes thus grown great by the conquest of Assyria stood about 50 years <a id="l325"></a>till  it was conquered by Cyrus.  ‡

The <a id="l357"></a>meaning of Æeschylus is plainly this that in the Kingdom then  flourishing   was founded by the Kings of the Medes the first of which who began to conquer was Phraortes <a id="l359"></a>He conquered the Persians as Herodotus affirms &amp; so became the first King of <a id="l360"></a>the Persians in that Monarchy.

<p id="par19">Now because this Kingdom consists of two Provinces the northern <a id="l365"></a>of the Medes &amp; the southern of the Persians, whereof the <a id="l366"></a>
one rose up after the other,  Daniel represents it <a id="l367"></a>by a Beare which raised himself up on one side &amp; by a <a id="l368"></a>Ram with two horns whereof the lowe (that of the Medes) <a id="l369"></a>rose up first.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 5v resumes &gt; </span>

<p id="par20" class="i0">Smerdes  reigned 5 months, Artabanus &amp; <a id="l429"></a>Sogdian each of them seven &amp; Xerxes II  a year  but the short <a id="l431"></a>reigns of these kings  in summing up the years of all the kings do  not use to be recconned apart <a id="l432"></a> but are included in <a id="l433"></a>the reigns of their predecessors. Some allot only two months <a id="l434"></a>to  Xerxes II but then the reign of his prede<a id="l435"></a>cessor Artaxerxes must be recconned only 40 years &amp; <a id="l436"></a>the reign of his successor Darius Nothus  must end not at the same time with the Peloponnesian war <a id="l438"></a>as Diodorus affirms it did but in the summer before. <a id="l439"></a>Eusebius takes 3 years from  the reign of Artaxerxes <a id="l440"></a>Mnemon &amp; gives them to Ochus. The monarchy was <a id="l441"></a>translated to the Greeks by the battel at Arbela Octob 2 <a id="l442"></a>in the year of Nabonassar 417, but Darius was not <a id="l443"></a>slain till a year &amp; some months after. Whence <a id="l444"></a> Africanus reccons that the Monarchy stood 230 <a id="l445"></a>years &amp; Agathias 228.</p>
<p id="par21">The  years of Cambysis &amp; <a id="l446"></a>Darius Hystaspis are fully determined by three eclipses  observed <a id="l447"></a>at Babylon &amp; recorded by Ptolomy: those of Xerxes <a id="l448"></a>by the battle at Marathon four years &amp; some months <a id="l449"></a>before the death of Darius &amp; by the  passage of Xer<a id="l450"></a>xes over the Hellespont to invade Greece  in the <a id="l451"></a>beginning of his sixt year in the time of the Olym<a id="l452"></a>pic games: those of Artaxerxes Longimanus by the <a id="l453"></a>coincidence of his  twentyth year with the 4<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l454"></a>the 83<sup>d</sup> Olympiad as Africanus informs us &amp; by the <a id="l455"></a>news of his death coming to Athens in winter in <a id="l456"></a>the seventh year of the Peloponnesian war as <a id="l457"></a>Thucydes a writer of those times has recorded: those of Darius Nothus by <a id="l458"></a>the coincidence of his 13<sup>th</sup> year or some  part <a id="l459"></a>thereof in winter with the 20<sup>th</sup> year of the Peloponnesian <a id="l460"></a>war as Thucydides   also set down, &amp; by his death <a id="l462"></a>a little after the end of that war in the same Olympic year <a id="l463"></a>as Diodorus informs us. For the war began in April an. 1 <a id="l464"></a>Olymp 87, lasted 27 years &amp; end April 14<sup>th</sup> an 4 Olymp 93. <a id="l465"></a>All these things are so well determined by Eclipses &amp; other <a id="l466"></a>records of good credit &amp; so far agreed upon by Chronologers <a id="l467"></a>that I do not think it material to enter into any dispute <a id="l468"></a>about them.</p>
<p id="par22">The difficulty is to agree the Iewish history set down <a id="l469"></a>in Ezra &amp; Nehemiah, with the history of these kings written <a id="l470"></a>by  the Greeks &amp; Latins For some would have the Temple to be built in the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> reign of Darius Nothus &amp; the city in the reign of Artaxerxes <a id="l471"></a>Mnemon; others refer these things to the reigns of Darius <a id="l472"></a>Hystaspis &amp; Artaxerxes Longimanus. The latter opinion I <a id="l473"></a>take to be true  but because <a id="l474"></a>divers are of the former opinion &amp; thereupon ground <a id="l475"></a> erroneou interpretations of Daniels weeks, I shall now for <a id="l476"></a>setling the true interpretation of so important a prophesy <a id="l477"></a>&amp; clearing up the history of the books of Ezra &amp; Nehemiah shew that the latter opinion is the truth, &amp; for this end <a id="l478"></a>I shall premise the two following observations.</p>
<p id="par23">Obs. 1. All the middle part of the Book of  <a id="l479"></a>Nehemiah from the 5<sup>t</sup> verse of the seventh chapter to <a id="l480"></a>the 9<sup>th</sup> verse of the twelft conteins the history of what <a id="l481"></a>was done at Zerubbabel's return from captivity in the reign <a id="l482"></a>of Cyrus.</p>

<p id="par24"> <span class="ns">☉</span></p>

<p id="par26">First that  all the middle <a id="l495"></a>part of Nehemiah's book from chap 7. v. 5 to chap 12 v.9 con<a id="l496"></a>teins the history of what was done  at the  return <a id="l497"></a>from captivity under Zerubbabel in the reign of Cyrus. <a id="l498"></a>For  Nehemiah tells you <a id="l499"></a>he took it out of the register of those who came up at <a id="l500"></a>first Nehem 7.5, &amp; then out of that register first recites <a id="l501"></a>the second chapter of Ezra,  &amp;  after that the history of reading <a id="l502"></a>the law &amp; sealing a Covenant in the seventh month after their <a id="l503"></a>return when they set up the altar &amp; began to  sacrifice &amp; to keep the  feast <a id="l504"></a>of Tabernacles  according to what they found <a id="l505"></a>written in the law of Moses. Nehem 8.14 Ezr. 3.2, 4. Then <a id="l506"></a>he recites  in  the 11<sup>th</sup> chapter  how the people who came out <a id="l507"></a>of captivity with Zerubbabel to Ierusalem  cast lots to dwell <a id="l508"></a>one of ten in Ierusalem &amp; the other nine parts in the other <a id="l509"></a>cities:  &amp; lastly in the beginning of the 12<sup>th</sup> chapter is a <a id="l510"></a>register of the  Priests &amp; Levites who came up from captivity with <a id="l511"></a>Zerrubbabel &amp; Ieshua  as tis there exprest. </p>
<p id="par27">For clearing up this Observation I need only tell you that <a id="l512"></a>when Ezra read the law the Levites who made the people un<a id="l513"></a>derstand it    came up with Zerubbabel &amp; Ieshua as you <a id="l515"></a>may see by comparing their names Nehem. 9.5. &amp; 12.8  Ezra 2.40, &amp; 3.9 <a id="l516"></a>&amp; that the names of all the chief fathers of the Priests &amp; Levites who then came </p>

<h2 id="hd5" class="cent">The true chronology of the Persian Kings is as follows</h2>



<p id="par31"> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008v"> &lt;8v&gt; </span> </p>




<p id="par36">After Artaxerxes reigned Xerxes II two months, Sogdian <a id="l592"></a>7 months &amp; Darius Nothus 19 years. He died an 4 Olymp <a id="l593"></a>93 &amp; then  reigned Artaxerxes Mnemon  <a id="l594"></a>43 years.  Artaxerxes Ochus 23 years Arses <a id="l595"></a>3 years &amp; Darius Codomanus almost 5 years He was <a id="l596"></a>conquered by Alexander with great an 2 Olymp 112 Kal. <a id="l597"></a>Octob. &amp; died towards the end of the next Olympic year.</p>
</div>
<div>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span>        
<p id="par37" class="i0">up  with Zerubbabel &amp; were 24 in number  (Nehem 12.) are found  subscribed to the above mentioned Covenant <a id="l598"></a>made at that reading of the law Nehem 10. And lastly that the <a id="l599"></a>11<sup>th</sup> chapter of Nehemiah is recited in 1 Chron. 9,  with some <a id="l600"></a>variety &amp; reading, &amp; there those who  went by lot  to dwell in <a id="l602"></a>the cities are called the first inhabitants  after <a id="l603"></a>the captivity. And amongst those who were  then by lot to dwell at <a id="l604"></a>Ierusalem are recconed Mittamiah the Levite who was over the thanksgiving &amp; the porters Shallum, Akkub, Talmon <a id="l605"></a>1 Chron. 9. 15, 17 Nehem 11.17, 19 who came up at first with Zerubbabel <a id="l606"></a>Ezra 2.42. Nehem 12.8.</p>
<p id="par38">So then if we would understand fully the history of the <a id="l607"></a>Iews at their first return in the reign of Cyrus,  we must <a id="l608"></a> compare this part of the book of Nehemiah with  the book <a id="l609"></a>of Ezra,  &amp; consider how both may be set together so as joyntly make up one entire history. And this will be done by inserting the 11<sup>th</sup> chapter of  Nehemiah <a id="l610"></a>between the two last verses of the 2<sup>d</sup> chapter of Ezra <a id="l611"></a>&amp; the 8<sup>th</sup> 9<sup>th</sup> &amp; 10<sup>th</sup> chapters of Nehemiah between the <a id="l612"></a>6<sup>th</sup> &amp; 7<sup>th</sup> verses of the third chapter of Ezra. For so the whole story will be read in continued order of <a id="l613"></a>time.  By the first insertion you will understand <a id="l614"></a>how the people who came up to Ierusalem with Zerubbabel went thence by <a id="l615"></a>lot into their cities &amp; dwelt there till the seventh month <a id="l616"></a>came as is exprest in the last verse of the 2<sup>d</sup> chapter of Ezra &amp; <a id="l617"></a>first of the 3<sup>d</sup>:  &amp; by the second insertion you will understand how <a id="l618"></a>the Priests &amp; people, in setting up the altar &amp;  offering sacrifices from the first day of the 7<sup>th</sup> month,  &amp; keeping<a id="l620"></a> the feast of Tabernacles, as is described in the <a id="l621"></a>third chapter of Ezra, were instructed  out of the law <a id="l622"></a>of Moses publickly read to them at the same time by Ezra . <a id="l623"></a> For Ezra refers  to this reading of the law in saying: <a id="l624"></a><em class="underline">  They built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt <a id="l625"></a>offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the <a id="l626"></a>man of God – They kept also the feast of Tabernacles, as <a id="l627"></a>it is written</em>. Ezra 3.2, 4.</p>
<p id="par39">The second observation I would make is for clearing <a id="l628"></a>up the history of the Iews in the reigns of Darius &amp; <a id="l629"></a>Artaxerxes: &amp; it is that  the middle part of the fourth chapter of Ezra concerning <a id="l631"></a>Ahashuerus &amp; Artaxerxes, that is from the 6<sup>t</sup>  verse to the 26<sup>t</sup> inclusively, is a fragment <a id="l632"></a>of history inserted by some mistake of the scribe in <a id="l633"></a>a wrong place of the book of Ezra &amp; ought rather <a id="l634"></a>to have been added to the end of the book. And my <a id="l635"></a>reasons  are these.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span>  First I consider the <a id="l647"></a>the first book of Esdras is nothing else then the <a id="l648"></a>genuine book of Ezra interpoled between the first &amp; second <a id="l649"></a> chapters  with the letter to Artaxerxes <a id="l650"></a>&amp; the Kings answer &amp; with the story of the three young <a id="l651"></a>men speaking wise sentences &amp; augmented in the begin<a id="l652"></a>ning with part of the second book of Chronicles &amp; in the <a id="l653"></a>end with a fragment <a id="l654"></a>of the book of  Nehemiah. <a id="l655"></a>Omit these interpolations &amp; additions &amp; you have in this <a id="l656"></a>book of Esdras an ancient translation of the genuine <a id="l657"></a> book of Ezra into greek: &amp; in this translation all the <a id="l658"></a>above mentioned middle part of the 4<sup>th</sup> chapter  is <a id="l659"></a>wanting. I conceive therefore that when Antiochus <a id="l660"></a>Epiphanes caused the sacred books to be burnt &amp; all men <a id="l661"></a>to be slain who concealed them , &amp; the Macchabees re<a id="l662"></a>collected what had escaped; there were found  two <a id="l663"></a>fragments of history  relating to the  Persian Monarchy, which the Iews knew not how better <a id="l664"></a>to dispose of then by inserting them into the book <a id="l665"></a>
of Ezra. Some therefore inserted them between the <a id="l666"></a>first &amp; second chapters of this book, &amp; this was the <a id="l667"></a>originall of the book of Esdras.  Others <a id="l668"></a>(whether the Sanedrin or any of the scribes) rejecting <a id="l669"></a>the story of the three young men speaking wise sentences <a id="l670"></a>as spurious, inserted only the fragment concerning <a id="l671"></a>Ahashuerus &amp; Artaxerxes  into the middle of the fourth <a id="l672"></a>chapter  as a genuine  record, &amp; this <a id="l673"></a>I take to be the original of the book of Ezra as <a id="l674"></a>we now have it.  And by the like <a id="l675"></a>accident I conceive it is. that  the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel &amp; the books of the Prophets cited in the book of Kings &amp; in that of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah are lost.   &amp; that a fragment of the prophesies <a id="l676"></a>of Isaiah are now found added to the end of the book of <a id="l677"></a>Zachary &amp; that in the 1<sup>st</sup> book of Samuel the story of Davids <a id="l678"></a>playing before Saul to drive away his evil spirit &amp; becoming <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> his armour-bearer &amp; Saul's loving him greatly has been <a id="l679"></a> inserted before the story of Davids killing Goliah when Saul <a id="l680"></a>knew him not but asked again &amp; again whose so he <a id="l681"></a>was. [And so in the new Testament Criticks have observed that the words <em class="underline">For thine is <a id="l682"></a>the kingdom the power &amp; the glory</em> have been added in Matthew <a id="l683"></a>to the Lords prayer &amp;  the story of the woman taken in <a id="l684"></a>adultery  inserted in Iohn's Gospel &amp; Mark's Gospel <a id="l685"></a>augmented by the 12 last verses &amp; by consequence Matthews <a id="l686"></a>by the last chapter. For had  Matthew written the <a id="l687"></a>story of the resurrection  Mark who copies after him <a id="l688"></a>would scarce have  omitted it. And this Origen seems to have <a id="l689"></a>been aware of when he commented on all Matthew but <a id="l690"></a>the last chapter. However these  addition being ancient re<a id="l691"></a>cords approved by the Church we receive them as of the <a id="l692"></a>same authority with the rest of the books &amp; only  reserve <a id="l693"></a>a liberty of interpretation where any of them has been <a id="l694"></a>inserted in a wrong place.]</p>
<p id="par40">The fragment therefore concerning Ahashuerus &amp; <a id="l695"></a>Artaxerxes being inserted in one place in Ezra &amp; in <a id="l696"></a>another in Esdras,  I take to have been a lose  <a id="l697"></a> piece of history inserted to both books in the times of the Mac<a id="l698"></a>cabees, &amp; think it ought rather to have been added to the <a id="l699"></a>end of the book,  &amp; that for these <a id="l700"></a>reasons. First because by inserting it in the middle of <a id="l701"></a>the fourth chapter the story of building the Temple <a id="l702"></a>is interrupted.  It concerns only the building of the City <a id="l703"></a>&amp; so respects the time after the Temple was finished. <a id="l704"></a>Secondly because  the letter to Artaxerxes was written against the Iews who came <a id="l705"></a>up from captivity in his reign,  &amp; by consequence <a id="l706"></a>against Ezra &amp; those who came up with him. For the <a id="l707"></a>letter to Artaxerxes runs thus: <em class="underline">Be it known unto <a id="l708"></a>the King that the Iews which came up from thee to us <a id="l709"></a> are come  unto Ierusalem building the rebellious <a id="l710"></a>&amp; bad city &amp; have set up the walls thereof &amp; joyned <a id="l711"></a>the foundations.</em> ✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 9v &gt; </span>✝ These Iews I say must be Ezra &amp; his companions because they <a id="l712"></a>were the  only Iews who came up from Artaxerxes. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 10r resumes &gt; </span> Thirdly because  when the enemies of the Iews received the Kings answer that the <a id="l714"></a>City should not be built till he gave another commandment, <a id="l715"></a>they   went up in hast to Ierusalem <a id="l716"></a> unto these Iews &amp; made them cease by force &amp; <a id="l717"></a>power, that is by force of arms, &amp; by consequence  demolished <a id="l718"></a>the wall they had been building. And this happened  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span> after Ezra's return from captivity,  about the nineteenth year <a id="l719"></a>of Artaxerxes.  For in the twentith year of the King near the beginning of the year the <a id="l726"></a> news came first to the ears of Nehemiah in Shushan the <a id="l727"></a>Palace that the remnant of the captivity  in Iudea <em class="underline">were <a id="l728"></a>in great affliction &amp; reproach &amp; the wall of Ierusalem broken <a id="l729"></a>down &amp; the gates thereof burnt with fire</em>. Nehem. 1. This news coming ‡
<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 11v &gt; </span>‡ coming fresh at this time to the ears of Nehemiah <a id="l730"></a>makes it certain that the Iews  who came <a id="l731"></a>up with Ezra did attempt to repair the city &amp; were  <a id="l732"></a> hindred by their enemies &amp; brought into affliction &amp; reproach <a id="l733"></a>&amp; the walls  broken down &amp; the gates burnt with fire &amp; of these <a id="l734"></a>things we have no other account then in that fragment.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 11r resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par41">So then this fragment should have been added to the <a id="l735"></a>end of the book of Ezra as a conclusion of his govern<a id="l736"></a>ment &amp; an introduction to that of Nehemiah &amp; perhaps it was, broken of from thence in the reign of Antiochus Epihanes.. But if any <a id="l737"></a>man think otherwise, he may take the book of Ezra <a id="l738"></a>as now is &amp; only put upon it this interpretation <a id="l739"></a>that Ezra relates  in the 4<sup>th</sup> chapter first how <a id="l740"></a>the building of the Temple was hindred all the days <a id="l741"></a>of Cyrus untill the reign of Darius Hystaspis in whose <a id="l742"></a>reign it was built, &amp;  how   so soon as this <a id="l743"></a>king  who favoured the Iews, was dead, their <a id="l744"></a>enemies conspired against them afresh to hinder the <a id="l745"></a>building of the city &amp; for that end wrote against <a id="l746"></a>them first in the beginning of the reign of his son &amp; successor Aha<a id="l747"></a>shuerus, (that is Achsweros,  Axeres or Xerxes)  <a id="l748"></a> &amp; then in the reign of his sucessor Artaxerxes Longimanus <a id="l749"></a>when the Iews who  came up from this <a id="l750"></a>King to Ierusalem as the letter mentions (that is  Ezra &amp; <a id="l751"></a>those who came up with him) were building the  walls, <a id="l752"></a>&amp; that Ezra so soon as he has related these things <a id="l753"></a>returns back to relate how the Temple was built <a id="l754"></a> &amp; finished in the reign <a id="l755"></a>of Darius Hystaspis by the prophesying of  Haggai <a id="l756"></a>&amp; Zecchary. This interpretation clears up the whole <a id="l757"></a>history  &amp; makes it consistent with the history of the <a id="l758"></a>Persian monarchy  recorded by the Greeks.</p>
<p id="par42">These Observations being premised, I  now affirm that <a id="l759"></a>the Temple was built in the  reign of Darius Hystaspis &amp; that <a id="l760"></a>Ezra &amp; Nehemiah came to Ierusalem in the  reign of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span>  Artaxerxes Longimanus &amp; that for these reasons.</p>
<p id="par43">First because they that refer these things to the <a id="l761"></a>reigns of  Darius Nothus &amp; Artaxerxes Mnemon <a id="l762"></a> do generally agree that by Ahashuerus &amp; Ar<a id="l763"></a>taxerxes in the above mentioned fragment are to be <a id="l764"></a>understood Xerxes &amp; Artaxerxes Longimanus: &amp; we <a id="l765"></a>have already proved that it was in the reign of this <a id="l766"></a>Artaxerxes that Ezra &amp; Nehemiah came up to Ieru<a id="l767"></a>salem. Tis certain out of that fragment that in the <a id="l768"></a>reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus there came up a <a id="l769"></a>body of Iews from the King to Ierusalem &amp;  <a id="l770"></a>attempted to build the walls of the City &amp; were forcibly hindred <a id="l771"></a>by an armed power of their enemies, &amp; the walls de<a id="l772"></a>molished. Tis certain also that all these things happened <a id="l773"></a>in the reign of that Artaxerxes from / whom Ezra <a id="l774"></a>&amp; Nehemiah came up. And why we should make <a id="l775"></a> the very same things happen in the reigns of more <a id="l776"></a>then one Artaxerxes,  I do not understand.</p>
<p id="par44">Secondly the second year of that Darius in  whose reign <a id="l779"></a>the temple was built from the ground &amp; finished (Hagg. 2.15, 18), was the seventith <a id="l780"></a>of  Zedekiahs captivity  (Zech. 1. 12 &amp; 7.5) &amp; at that time <a id="l781"></a>there were men living who had seen the first <a id="l782"></a>temple, Haggai 2.3, &amp; this  cannot be applied to the reign of Darius <a id="l784"></a>Nothus, but agrees well to the reigne of Darius Hystaspis. <a id="l785"></a>For his second year was the 70<sup>th</sup> from the final <a id="l786"></a>captivity of Iudea &amp; burning of the Temple.</p>
<p id="par45">Thirdly if the  Temple was not finished till <a id="l787"></a>the reign of Darius Nothus, then Zerubbabel must <a id="l788"></a>have continued captain of the Iews, &amp; Ieshua their high <a id="l789"></a>Priest, from the  first <a id="l790"></a>year of Cyrus to the sixt of  this Darius, that is <a id="l791"></a>112 years together, which is incredible, &amp;most certainly <a id="l792"></a>false. For the High Priesthood of Ieshua was but of <a id="l793"></a>an ordinary length as you may know by comparing it <a id="l794"></a> &amp; that of his son Iojakin with the contem<a id="l795"></a>porary Priesthoods of the other  Priests.

Nehem. 12.1 And in <a id="l801"></a>the days of Iojakim the son of Ieshua that is in the days <a id="l802"></a>of his High Priesthood the chief Priests were all the eldest <a id="l803"></a>sons of all  the chief Priests now <a id="l804"></a>named, videlicet, Merajah the son of Serajah, Hananiah the <a id="l805"></a>son of Ieremiah, Meshullam the son of Ezra, Iehoha<a id="l806"></a>nan the son of Amariah, Ionathan the son of Melicu, <a id="l807"></a>Ioseph the son of Shebaniah,  Adnach the son of Harim <a id="l808"></a>Helkai the son of Merajoth,  Zechariah the son of Iddo <a id="l809"></a>Meshullam the son of Ginnethon, Zichri the son of <a id="l810"></a>Abijah, &amp;c. Nehem 12.12. This synchronising of the High-<a id="l811"></a>Priesthood of Ieshua with the Priesthood of  all the fathers <a id="l812"></a>&amp; of the high Priesthood of his son Iojakim with the high <a id="l813"></a>Priesthood of all their eldest sons is a demonstration <a id="l814"></a>that the High Priesthood of Ieshua was but of an ordinary <a id="l815"></a>&amp; therefore could not possibly reach down to <a id="l816"></a>the reign of Darius Nothus.</p>
<p id="par46">Fourthly  Chronologers reccon from the  <a id="l817"></a> return of the Iewish captivity in the first year <a id="l818"></a>of Cyrus to the  death of  Alexander the great <a id="l819"></a>208 years: &amp; in all this  time the Iews had six <a id="l820"></a>High Priests succeeding from father to son, namely Ieshua <a id="l821"></a>Iojakim, Eliashib, Iojada, Ionathan, Iaddua,  the last of which saith Iosephus died about the same time with Alexander or  soon after. Let the Priesthood of each by an equal division of the  whole time among them be recconed about 35 years in length &amp; the &amp; the <a id="l832"></a> Priesthood of Eliashib will begin with the 5<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l833"></a>of Artaxerxes Longimanus &amp; end with the 39<sup>th</sup> of  the same King : And this agrees well with the truth. For Eliashib <a id="l835"></a>was high Priest  in the 20<sup>th</sup> year of this Artaxerxes Nehem. 3.1 &amp; continued High Priest for some time after  his 32<sup>th</sup> <a id="l837"></a>year  Nehem 13.7, 28.  &amp; Nehemiah was governour  all this  time. But if you make Nehemiah Governour <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> in the reign of Artaxerxes Mnemon; the High Priesthood <a id="l840"></a>of Eliashib will reach some time beyond the 32<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l841"></a>of that king &amp; so  the  Priesthood of the <a id="l842"></a>three first High Priests will take up  160 years &amp; those <a id="l843"></a>of the five last but 50 years which is too unequal a <a id="l844"></a>division. For  as the high Priesthood of Ieshua was <a id="l845"></a>contemporary to the Priesthoods of the fathers who came <a id="l846"></a>up with him out of Captivity &amp; the high Priesthood of <a id="l847"></a>his son Iojakim with the Priesthoods of there  <a id="l848"></a>eldest sons so the high Priesthood of his grandson Eliashib <a id="l849"></a>was contemporary to the Priesthoods of their eldest grandsons <a id="l850"></a> &amp; therefore they were all but of an ordinary <a id="l851"></a>length. For Zechariah the son of Ionathan the son <a id="l852"></a>of Shemaiah was one of the chief Priests at with dedication <a id="l853"></a>of the wall Nehem 12.35 , &amp;  so was contemporary to <a id="l854"></a>Eliashib; &amp; his father Ionathan was  chief Priest in the days of <a id="l855"></a>Iojakim &amp; his grandfather  Shemaiah  in the days of Ieshua Nehem <a id="l856"></a>12.6, 18. So far were the Priesthoods of these men <a id="l857"></a>from being of an extraordinary length that  <a id="l858"></a>in the seventh year of Artaxerxes when Ezra <a id="l859"></a>came up to Ierusalem he found there the eldest <a id="l860"></a>sons of those who came up with Zerubbabel in the <a id="l861"></a> reign of Cyrus &amp; were then chief fathers of their <a id="l862"></a>houses.    For when he came up <a id="l863"></a>to Ierusalem   Iozabad the son of Ieshua <a id="l864"></a>&amp; Noadiah the son of Binnui were chief among the <a id="l865"></a>Levites, Ezra 8.33 &amp;  when Zerubbabel came up <a id="l866"></a>their fathers Ieshua &amp; Binnui were chief fathers <a id="l867"></a> of their houses Ezra 2.40 &amp; 3.9.

<p id="par47"> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015r"> &lt;15r&gt; </span> </p>
<p id="par48">Thus you see the reasons for placing  Ezra &amp; Ne<a id="l892"></a>hemiah in the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus &amp; the <a id="l893"></a>building of the Temple in that of Darius Hystaspis are <a id="l894"></a>exceeding strong  &amp; convincing. And now I will shew <a id="l895"></a>you that the reasons to the contrary are as weak. For  <a id="l896"></a>  there are only these two of any moment. First say they Ezra in his <a id="l897"></a>fourth &amp; fift chapters names the Kings of Persia in this <a id="l898"></a>order Cyrus, Darius, Ahashuerus, Artaxerxes, Darius, Artax<a id="l899"></a>erxes &amp; refers the building of the temple to the Darius <a id="l900"></a>between the two Artaxerxes,  &amp; Darius <a id="l901"></a>Nothus say they was the only Darius between the two Artax<a id="l902"></a>erxes. This argument is the foundation of their Hypothesis, &amp; yet has nothing in it. For  I have already  proved that the last Darius <a id="l903"></a>here named is the same with the first &amp; the last Artax<a id="l904"></a>erxes the same with the first. The other  reason  <a id="l905"></a>is that Sanballat with his daughter &amp; son in law men<a id="l906"></a>tioned Nehem 13.28 were alive in the reigns of Darius <a id="l907"></a>Codomnnus  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span>  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015v"> &lt;15v&gt; </span>  &amp; Alexander the great as Io<a id="l924"></a>sephus relates which could not well have been, had they flourished in the reigns of Artaxerxes Longimanus.. But this I take to be a mistake <a id="l925"></a>of the Iews founded upon their erroneous chronology.. They read in Nehemiah that after the 32<sup>th</sup> <a id="l926"></a>year of Artaxerxes Nehemiah chased from him  the son of Iehojada the son of Eliashib the High Priest. <a id="l928"></a> because he had married the daughter of Sanballat. They <a id="l929"></a>had also a tradition that Sanballat to retain his son in <a id="l930"></a>law with his daughter &amp; requite him for the loss of the <a id="l931"></a>Priesthood promised to get leave of the king of Persia to <a id="l932"></a>build  a new Temple for him on mount Gerazim. And  <a id="l933"></a>whilst they made Darius Hystaspis, Artaxerxes, Darius Nothus &amp; Darius <a id="l934"></a>Codomannus to be one &amp; the same king  <a id="l935"></a>reigning but 36 years (as we told you above) they were <a id="l936"></a>necessitated to refer these things to the  two or three last years <a id="l937"></a>of Darius Codomannus wherein Alexander the great made <a id="l938"></a>war upon him, &amp; by consequence to  mix this story with <a id="l940"></a>the wars of Alexander &amp; make  the Temple of the Samaritans  on mount Gerazim built by <a id="l941"></a>Alexanders  consent  <a id="l942"></a>  For  Iosephus tells us that Sanballat was sent by the last Darius (him whom Alexander vanquished) to be governour of Samaria, &amp; therefore  with the erring Iews  referred the whole story of  Nehemiah &amp; Sanballat to the reign of this Darius.</p>
<p id="par49">If this answer do not satisfy,  I <a id="l943"></a>shall back it with another.  A learned Prelate has ob<a id="l944"></a>served that  the Sanballat   mentioned by Nehemiah was a <a id="l945"></a>Horomite, that is, a Moabite of the city Horonaim (Ier. 48.<a id="l946"></a>3, 5, 34) but he mentioned by Iosephus was a Cuthean as Io<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 16r &gt; </span>sephus affirms)<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 15v resumes &gt; </span> <a id="l947"></a>that is a Samaritan from Cutha or Susiana beyond Euphrates: &amp; that <a id="l948"></a>Iaddus,  &amp; the son in law of the latter his <a id="l949"></a>brother. If  these were not the Same Sanballats <a id="l950"></a>the objection is at an end. But  if you think strange <a id="l951"></a>there should be more Sanballats then one, I presume you <a id="l952"></a>will be  more unwilling to allow two Ezra's both of them <a id="l953"></a>Priests &amp; scribes &amp; two Nehemiah's both of them sons <a id="l954"></a>of Hachaliah &amp; governors of the Iews. And yet without <a id="l955"></a>allowing this you must make one &amp; the same Ezra Priest <a id="l956"></a>&amp; scribe from the first &amp; second years of Cyrus when he returned from captivity (Nehem<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 16r &gt; </span>.12.1) &amp;<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 15v resumes &gt; </span> read <a id="l957"></a>the law to all the people (Nehem 8)  untill the 28<sup>th</sup> year of Artax<a id="l958"></a>erxes  Mnemon, when (according to your hypothesis) he was at the dedication of the wall (Nehem <a id="l959"></a>12.36) that is for 160 years together  &amp;  one &amp; the same Nehemiah  <a id="l961"></a> Governor by fits from the same  first &amp; second <a id="l962"></a>year of Cyrus when he returned from the captivity , was <a id="l963"></a>Tirshatha or Governor  &amp; signed the covenant <a id="l964"></a>(Ezra 2. 2,  63,  1 Esdr. 5.40,   till after with 32<sup>th</sup> <a id="l965"></a>year of the same Artaxerxes, (Ezra 13.) that is for above 164 <a id="l966"></a>years together. So you see your objection is answered <a id="l967"></a>with a greater against you.</p>

Nebuchadnezzar, they say, reigned 45 years (2 King. 25.27) Ier. 25.1 Belshazar three (Dan 8.1) &amp; thence Evilmerodach 23 to make up 70     the first year of Nebuchadnezzar in which the prophesy of the 70 years was given. For they reccon that it was fulfilled by Darius the Mede seizing the Kingdome. To this Darius they assigne but one year  or at most but two (Dan 9.1) <a id="l978"></a>To Cyrus three years incomplete (Dan 10.1,) Ahashuerus 14  years till the casting of Pur (Esth 3.7) one year <a id="l980"></a>more till the Iews smote their enemies (ch. 9.1) &amp; one year <a id="l981"></a>more till Esther &amp; Mordecai  wrote the second letter <a id="l982"></a>for the keeping of Purim  (ch. 9.29.) in all 14 years, &amp; to Darius <a id="l983"></a> they allot 32 or rather 36 years Nehem. 13.6. so that the Persian Empire <a id="l984"></a>during the  second Temple flourished according to their recconing only 34 years  untill <a id="l985"></a>Alexander the great overthrew it.

<h2 id="hd8" class="cent">The Chronology of the Gospel.</h2>
<p id="par62">Artaxerxes king of Persia in the seventh year of his reign <a id="l1148"></a>sent Ezra &amp; the Iews from Babylon to Ierusalem with a commission to restore the worship of God <a id="l1149"></a>&amp; teach the people his law &amp; to set magistrates &amp; Iudges over  Iudea with <a id="l1150"></a>power to punish by death or banishment or confiscation of goods or imprison<a id="l1151"></a>ment: And by this commission the Iews in Iudea were incorporated into a  <a id="l1152"></a>People &amp; Holy City (Ezra 7.) And from the erecting this corporation to the <a id="l1153"></a>finishing of transgression &amp; making an end of sins &amp; making reconciliation <a id="l1154"></a>for iniquity &amp; bringing in everlasting righteousness [by the sacrifice of the Lamb of God] &amp; the  sealing  the vision &amp; Prophet &amp;  annointing the most <a id="l1156"></a>Holy  <a id="l1157"></a>[by the  &amp; resurrection of  Christ &amp; the giving him a name above every name &amp; making him <a id="l1158"></a>king of Kings &amp; Lord of Lords the Messiah the Prince] were seventy weeks of years (Dan. 9.24.) <a id="l1159"></a>&amp; therefore Jesus Christ died A.C. 34,  in a sabbatical year, the seventy <a id="l1160"></a>weeks ending each of them with sabbatical years, as was the manner of <a id="l1161"></a>recconing among the Iews, &amp; the preceeding year having 13 months that the passion may fall on a friday.</p>
<p id="par63">It was the practise of Christ to draw Parables from all things <a id="l1162"></a>which were before the eyes of his hearers: &amp; accordingly in allusion to the Iews making their servants free  in <a id="l1163"></a>the feast of the seventh month which next preceded his passion <a id="l1164"></a>he tells the Iews that the truth shall make them free &amp; the Iews replying <a id="l1165"></a>that they were Abrahams seeds &amp; never were in bondage he tells them that <a id="l1166"></a>whoever commits sin is the servant of sin &amp; if the son shall make them <a id="l1167"></a>free they shall be free indeed. Whence I conclude that this was the year in which the Iews released their servants <a id="l1168"></a>  or sabbatical year A.C. 34.</p>
<p id="par64">In the  15<sup>th</sup> year of Tiberius Iohn began to baptize, suppose in spring <a id="l1169"></a>when the summer was before him A.C. 29 &amp; when his baptism was noised abroad <a id="l1170"></a> Iesus also came to be <a id="l1171"></a>baptized being about 30 years old when he began to manifest himself, suppose in <a id="l1172"></a>autumn  following.  <a id="l1173"></a> For Iohn was six months older then Christ &amp;  30 years was <a id="l1174"></a> thought a fit age for Priests to enter upon their ministry. <a id="l1175"></a>Iesus after his baptism went to Cana in Galilee &amp; to Capernaum where he spent <a id="l1176"></a>some time &amp; then went to Iudea, was tempted, kept the first Passover,  <a id="l1177"></a>went into the land of Iudea baptizing &amp; learned there till Iohn was cast into prison,  &amp; then <a id="l1178"></a>departed through Samaria into Galilee four months before the harvest,  ( that is in December or Ianuary) &amp; <a id="l1180"></a>began to preach,  &amp; went thence to the next Feast <a id="l1181"></a>(Iohn 4. Mat 4.) This was the second Passover. Then he preached his sermon in <a id="l1182"></a>the mount when the Lilies were in the field  suppose in May  &amp; conversed <a id="l1183"></a>afterwards in Galilee  &amp; in  winter following passs over the sea of Galilee <a id="l1184"></a>into the Country of the Gergesens was in a great tempest,  &amp; returning back to his own city preached still in Galilee,  &amp;  sent his twelve disciples to preach  in <a id="l1187"></a> the cities of the Iews  went  also himself about their cities preaching <a id="l1188"></a>till the next passover &amp; on the chief  sabbath of the   second Passover of this year or passover of <a id="l1189"></a>the second month he went through the corn  (Mat 12.)  &amp; in seed time following he put forth the Parable of the sower &amp; another Parable <a id="l1191"></a>of sowing good seed &amp; tares &amp; a third parable of sowing mustard seed, &amp; in that winter heard that Iohn was beheaded in prison &amp; his disciples returned to him &amp; in  the end of winter  walked on the sea to his disciples who were in <a id="l1193"></a>a ship tossed with a tempest (Matt 14) This was a little before the next Passover <a id="l1194"></a>(Iohn 7.1, 2) &amp; suffered in the Passover following which  being the fift Passover after <a id="l1195"></a>his baptism, was in spring A.C. 34. All this I gather by comparing the Gospels of Matthew &amp; Iohn who wrote <a id="l1196"></a>in due order of time  having seen almost all they wrote.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p021r"> &lt;21r&gt; </span>
<p id="par65">Luke tells us that when  in circumcising Christ &amp; purifying the virgin <a id="l1197"></a>they had performed all things according to the`law, which was within 40 days they returned into Galilee to their own city Nazareth <a id="l1198"></a>But Matthew aquaints us that they went first into Egypt &amp;  upon the death of Herod went <a id="l1199"></a>from Egypt into Galilee  to the city Nazareth  Whence I gather that the <a id="l1200"></a>time between the birth of Christ &amp; death of Herod was very short, perhaps not above three or <a id="l1201"></a>four months. The Magi came to worship Christ while his parents staid at Bethlehem  in an Inn &amp; by consequence soon after his birth, &amp; Herod slew the children  as soon as he found <a id="l1202"></a>himself mocked of the wise men: all which might be done within two months after the birth of <a id="l1203"></a>the child. Herod indeed killed all the children under two yearlings, that is all that were a year old or under, <a id="l1204"></a>but he might do it to make sure work. Now the Iews in their Calender place the death of Herod <a id="l1205"></a>about the time of the winter solstice or a few days before. I have forgotten the day of their <a id="l1206"></a>Month. He died a linguering death &amp; when his disease began to be thought incurable <a id="l1207"></a> some of the Iews for throwing down a golden eagle from the Temple were <a id="l1208"></a>slain by his command upon a day on which the Moon was Eclipsed.  <a id="l1209"></a>Such an Eclips happened in the night between Feb. 3 &amp; Feb 4  a year &amp; 11 months <a id="l1210"></a>before the vulgar Æra &amp; the summer following was spent by Herod in  <a id="l1211"></a>languishing under his distemper going to the hot bath beyond Iordan  <a id="l1212"></a>sending for one out of every family of the Iews &amp; doing other things mentioned by <a id="l1213"></a>Iosephus. Now Iosephus tells us  both in <a id="l1214"></a>his Antiquities &amp; in his Book  of the Iewish war that Herod reigned 37 years from the <a id="l1215"></a>time that he was made king by the Roman Senate &amp; 34 from the time that he killed <a id="l1216"></a>Antipater,  &amp; took Ierusalem.  These years <a id="l1217"></a>end in Iuly  five or six months <a id="l1218"></a>after the above mentioned eclips &amp; there were four or five months more to Herods <a id="l1219"></a>death which Iosephus  in recconning by round numbers of years neglects.  <a id="l1220"></a>And Luke saith that when Christ was twelve years old  he  disputed in the <a id="l1221"></a>temple at the Passover &amp; only that he was about  30 years old when he was <a id="l1222"></a>baptized,  to suppose him born in spring about eight months before the death <a id="l1223"></a>of Herod, &amp; a year &amp; three quarters before the vulgar Æra,  will answer perfectly well to the scriptures &amp; to Iosephus. Then might <a id="l1224"></a>shepherds be able to watch their flocks all night in the fields, &amp; Then might the Iews <a id="l1225"></a>go conveniently out of all Iudæa to Ierusalem to be taxed  it being neither seed time <a id="l1226"></a>nor harvest &amp; the  season being convenient for travelling.  If any man had <a id="l1227"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ] had rather suppose <a id="l1232"></a>that Christ was born at Christmas preceding;  I might reply that Christmas <a id="l1233"></a>was instituted in the room of a heathen festival &amp; so is of no au<a id="l1234"></a>thority for determining the time: but I had rather say that the  difference of three months in time is a nicety not worth disputing about.</p> 
<p id="par66">Now when Nehemiah came from Artaxerxes to  Ierusalem the <a id="l1236"></a>first week of years after his coming be set apart for  repairing <a id="l1237"></a>the wall cutting &amp; seasoning of timber setting up the gates &amp; building so <a id="l1238"></a>much of the city as was necessary for the Governour &amp; inhabitants: the <a id="l1239"></a>street &amp; the wall will have continued   built.  sixty &amp; two weeks of years unto the <a id="l1240"></a>coming of the Messiah the Prince or birth of Iesus Christ. Nehemiah <a id="l1241"></a>writes that the wall was finished  in 52 days: but <a id="l1242"></a>this time if recconed from Nehemiah's coming to Ierusalem is much too short <a id="l1243"></a>for the whole performance &amp; therefore must be recconed from  <a id="l1244"></a>some later period. Nehemiah tells us that after the wall was built &amp; no <a id="l1245"></a>breaches left therein but the doors were not yet set upon the gates, Sanballet <a id="l1246"></a>&amp; Gesheru sent unto him five times thinking to weaken the hands of the Iews <a id="l1247"></a> from the work so that it should not be done &amp; then adds: <em class="underline">So the <a id="l1248"></a>wall was finished in the 22<sup>th</sup> day of the month Elul in 52 days</em>, meaning I <a id="l1249"></a>conceive, that the  remainder of the work of the wall was finished by setting up the doors in 52 days. . For he describes the making up of the breaches <a id="l1251"></a>to be a work of time, &amp; that when they were half made up the enemies of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022r"> &lt;22r&gt; </span> Iews conspired against them &amp; plotted to  invade &amp; disturb them <a id="l1252"></a>with an armed force. Whereupon the Iews armed themselves &amp; continued the one <a id="l1253"></a>half in arms the other half in the work till it was finished. And Nehemias giving <a id="l1254"></a>an account of the things he did during  his 12 years  government of Iudea <a id="l1255"></a>saith that he continued in the work of the wall &amp; bought no land. And Iosephus saith <a id="l1256"></a>that after they were in arms they continued in the work of the walls two years <a id="l1257"></a>&amp; four months &amp; finished it in the 28<sup>th</sup> year of Artaxerxes in the 9<sup>th</sup> month: <a id="l1258"></a>from which time to the birth of Christ there were just  threescore &amp; two  <a id="l1259"></a>Iudaic weeks, recconing every week to end with a sabbatic year.</p>
<p id="par67">When the Apostle Paul was newly converted he went into Arabia &amp; returned to Damascus <a id="l1260"></a>&amp; three years after his conversion went to  Ierusalem to see Peter (Gal 1) &amp; went <a id="l1261"></a>thence through Cæsarea to Tarsus. Then ceased the persecution of the Christians &amp; <a id="l1262"></a>Cornelius was converted &amp;  the Apostles sent Barnabas <a id="l1263"></a>to promote the gospel at Antioch &amp; Barnabas went from Antioch to Tarsus &amp; brought <a id="l1264"></a>Paul from thence to Antioch where they remained a year &amp; then  the brethren at Antioch sent relief to those at Ierusalem about <a id="l1265"></a>which time Herod Agrippa killed James the brother of Iohn &amp; imprisoned Peter.  This <a id="l1266"></a>was at the time of the Passover. And about the time that Paul &amp; Barnabas returned from <a id="l1267"></a>Antioch Herod died.  Iospehus tells us that he  reigned seven years, four with Caius &amp; three with Claudius &amp; <a id="l1268"></a>therefore he died in spring A.C. 44, &amp; Paul &amp; Barnabas came from Tarsus to Antioch in <a id="l1269"></a>the end of winter A.C. 43. ‡/‡ And if wee allow about four years from the death of Christ  for the preaching of the Gospel till the martyrdom of Stephen &amp; for the ensuing persecution carried on by Saul till his conversion &amp; three years more till Saul began his journey to Ierusalem &amp; after two years And if we allow  &amp; about two years  more for his journey from Da<a id="l1271"></a>mascus to Ierusalem &amp; thence to Tarsus &amp; for his stay at Tarsus &amp; journey to Antioch &amp; a year for <a id="l1272"></a>his stay at Antioch the Conversion of Cornelius &amp; calling of the Gentiles which happened wh<span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span> Paul was  newly arrived at Tarsus  will be about seven years <a id="l1273"></a>after the death of Christ.  And So long did the Messiah keep his covenant with  <a id="l1274"></a> his people the Iews.</p>
<p id="par68">After the death of Herod Paul &amp; Barnabas were sent abroad from Antioch to preach the <a id="l1275"></a>Gospel to both Iews &amp; Gentiles &amp; went to the cities of Cyprus Pamphylia Pisidia Ly<a id="l1276"></a>caonia &amp; returned thence to Antioch where they aboded a long time &amp; <a id="l1277"></a>upon some Iews contending that the Gentiles ought to be circumcised  were <a id="l1278"></a>sent to Ierusalem to know the opinion of the Apostles about this matter <a id="l1279"></a>  The did Paul &amp; Barnabas communicate to the Apostles <a id="l1282"></a>assembled in Council the Gospel which they preached to the Gentiles, &amp; oppose the circumcision of Titus, <a id="l1283"></a>&amp; then did the Apostles see that the Gospel of the uncircumcision was com<a id="l1284"></a>mitted to Paul as that of the circumcision was to Peter; &amp; this was 14 years <a id="l1285"></a>after the conversion of Paul  (Gal. 2. Act 15) &amp; by consequence A.C. 52, &amp; his conversion was in spring.</p>
<p id="par69">After Paul &amp; Barnabas returned to  Antioch with the  <a id="l1286"></a>sentence of the Apostles, he went with Silas through Syria &amp; Cilicia  con<a id="l1287"></a>firming the Churches &amp; through Prygia &amp; Galatia &amp; then they passed from Troas into <a id="l1288"></a>Macedonia &amp;  preached the Gospel in Philippi,  Thessalonica, Berea, Athens <a id="l1289"></a>&amp; Corinth  writing from Athens his two Epistles to the Thessalonians &amp; staying in Corinth 18 months &amp; then returned from thence to Ierusalem <a id="l1290"></a> at the time of the feast having a vow, &amp; touched at Ephesus in his return. <a id="l1291"></a> Then from Ierusalem he went to Antioch &amp; thence through Galatia &amp; Prygia <a id="l1292"></a>strengthening the disciples &amp; coming to Ephesus preached three months in the Synagogue <a id="l1293"></a> ‡ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 22v &gt; </span> ‡ &amp; two years more in the school of Tyrannus sending from thence his first <a id="l1304"></a>Epistle to the Corinthians. And leaving Ephesus at Pentecost he went into Mace<a id="l1305"></a>donia &amp; there wrote his second Epistle to the Corinthians, &amp; then spent the <a id="l1306"></a>three winter months in Greece &amp; wrote his epistle to the Romans in the end of <a id="l1307"></a>winter. And hasting to be at Ierusalem with alms at the day of the Pentecost <a id="l1308"></a>with a designe to go from thence to Rome &amp; from Rome into Spain he re<a id="l1309"></a>turned into Macedonia &amp; sailed thence after the days of unleavened bread &amp; <a id="l1310"></a>landed at Tyre &amp; went thence to Ierusalem where he was apprehended.</p>
<p id="par70">Now if for these two journeys of Paul through Asia Macedonia &amp; <a id="l1311"></a> Greece we allow seven years, the imprisonment of Paul will fall upon <a id="l1312"></a>Pentecost A.C. 59.  Sooner it could not be because the second journey took up <a id="l1313"></a>four years &amp; the first could not take up less then three: nor later because<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 22r resumes &gt; </span>nor later because he was a prisoner two years before  Felix <a id="l1314"></a>delivered him to Festus &amp; spent the autumn &amp; winter following in his voyage to Rome arriving  there <a id="l1315"></a>in spring &amp;  spent  two whole years more at Rome in his own hired house teaching <a id="l1316"></a>with all confidence, no man forbidding him. And this was done before that  sharp persecution  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023r"> &lt;23r&gt; </span> of  the Christians at Rome which was occasioned by the burning of  that City in Iune in <a id="l1317"></a>the Consulship of Lecanius Bassus &amp; Licinius Cressus  in the <a id="l1318"></a>10<sup>th</sup> year of Nero A.C. 64.  This Persecution therefore put an end to Pauls teaching freely &amp; to the <a id="l1319"></a>writing of the Acts of the Apostles, it being unsafe for Luke to describe  what was then done by Nero</p>
<p id="par71">Iosephus in the end of his Antiquities saith that 56 year of this age was the 13 year of Domitian &amp; in his own life written by himself  that he was born in <a id="l1320"></a>the first year of Caius Cæsar &amp;  that after the 26<sup>t</sup> year of his  own age he sailed <a id="l1321"></a>to Rome to sollicit the cause of some Priests of his acquaintance whom Felix governour of Iudea had <a id="l1322"></a>sent   prisoners thither. He went to Rome therefore in  the end of summer A.<a id="l1323"></a>C. 63: For the first year of Caius began in March A.C. 37.  &amp; the 13 of Domitian in August A.C. 93.‡‡&amp; in his voyage he suffered shipwrack. Before he went he heard that the prisoners lived an abstemious &amp; religious life at Rome &amp; therefore they went thither a year or two  before him. If two years  before  him then Felix <a id="l1326"></a>was succeeded by Festus A.C. 61 as above &amp; sent the Prisoners to Rome in <a id="l1327"></a>the very end of his government,  They might go to Rome in autumn &amp; be some of those Prisoners who went  in the same <a id="l1329"></a>ship with Paul.  Iosephus returned from Rome before the burning of that city A.C. 64, because he makes no mention of that fire. When Iosephus returned to Ierusalem he found  the <span class="ns">☉</span> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 23v &gt; </span><span class="ns">☉</span><span class="hspac-n" title="2 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When Iosephus returned to Ierusalem he found the Iews inclining to make a <a id="l1332"></a>defection from the Romans, &amp; endeavoured to disswade them from sedition but without <a id="l1333"></a>success. Wherefor fearing least they should take him for an enemy  &amp; <a id="l1334"></a>kill him  &amp; seing the castle Antonia in their possession he retired into the <a id="l1335"></a>inner Temple till the death of Manahem (Ioseph. in vita.)  <a id="l1339"></a>The Iews were not pleased with the government of Albinus, but continued quied <a id="l1340"></a>till  his successor Florus by his exceeding great cruelty &amp; injustice exasperated <a id="l1341"></a>them beyond measure: yet they complained not of him till Cestius Gallus Governour of Syria came to <a id="l1342"></a>the Passover A.C. 65. In the days of Felix the Iews &amp; Gentiles had a controversy <a id="l1343"></a>about the city Cæserea each claiming a right to it, &amp; Felix in the end of his <a id="l1344"></a>government referred the matter to Nero &amp;  about the time of this Passover Nero <a id="l1345"></a>gave judgment for the Gentiles &amp; letters arrived  certifying the decree: which <a id="l1346"></a>much inflamed the Iews against the Romans.  In the beginning of May Florus came <a id="l1347"></a>with an  armed force against them &amp; slew many of them. In  August they seized the <a id="l1348"></a>Castle of Antonia &amp; in September Menahem was slain. This was in the first year <a id="l1349"></a>of Florus &amp; 11<sup>th</sup> of Nero A.C. 65.  &amp; in the following spring the war began. From all which it may be gathered that the time <a id="l1350"></a>between the government of Felix &amp; that of Florus was short &amp; that the return <a id="l1351"></a>of Iosephus from Rome  suits  best with the year 64 &amp; could not be <a id="l1352"></a>sooner.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 23r resumes &gt; </span></p>

But Peter <a id="l1391"></a>was in the Council of the Apostles at Ierusalem in the 12 year of <a id="l1392"></a>Claus &amp; soon after was reprehended by Paul at Antioch &amp; about that time Claudius banished all Iews from Rome; &amp; Cyril <a id="l1393"></a>bishop of Ierusalem, Philastrius, Sulpitius, Prosper, Maximus Taurinensis, <a id="l1394"></a>&amp; Hegesippus junior place that victory of Peter  in the reign of Nero. <a id="l1395"></a>For the ancienter tradition was that Peter came to Rome in the <a id="l1396"></a>reign of this Emperor as you may see in Lacatantius. ✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 22v &gt; </span><a id="l1397"></a><br>✝ When Paul wrote his Epistle to the Romans, which was in    March Ierusalem A.C. 59, he saluted above 20 of the chief Christians at Rome by name <a id="l1398"></a>without naming Peter. After the burning of Rome Paul was  brought before Nero &amp; after <a id="l1399"></a> that, he wrote his second Epistle to Timothy <a id="l1403"></a> desiring him to come to Rome  before winter &amp; <a id="l1404"></a>bring  Mark with him &amp; tells him that Demas had forsaken him &amp; was gone <a id="l1405"></a>to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia, Tychicus to Ephesus [with an <a id="l1406"></a>Epistle] &amp; only Luke was with him: and therefore this Epistle to Timothy was writ in spring <a id="l1407"></a>&amp; in the year 65,  &amp; Mark &amp; Peter were not yet arrived at Rome &amp; <a id="l1408"></a>the first epistle of Peter in which Mark is mentioned was written after this year.  <a id="l1409"></a>Eusebius<sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> tells us of a tradition that after the martyrdom of Iames the brother of our Lord  <a id="l1410"></a>&amp; the taking of Ierusalem which presently followed  the Apostles &amp; disciples which survived <a id="l1411"></a>came together from all places &amp; with one consent made Symeon the son of Cleopas <a id="l1412"></a>Bischop of Ierusalem in the room of Iames. He should have put this election four years <a id="l1413"></a>before the war began. For Iames was martyred at that  time,  <a id="l1414"></a>&amp; the Apostles were so dispersed by the war that they could not come together after<a id="l1415"></a>ward.            <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 23r resumes &gt; </span> Chrysostom <a id="l1416"></a>tells us that the Apostles continued long in Iudea &amp; the being <a id="l1417"></a>driven out by the Iews went to the Gentiles. This dispersion was <a id="l1418"></a>in the  year  before the Iewish war began when the Iews as Iosephus <a id="l1419"></a>tells us, began to be tumultuous &amp; violent in all places &amp; Florus coming with an armed force to Ierusalem slew many of them &amp; the Gentiles at Cæsarea &amp; in all Syria &amp; divers cities of Phœnicia &amp; at Alexandria in Egypt  slew them in great multitudes as public enemies.  For at the same time they suspected also the Iudaizing Gentiles &amp; tho they did not kill them rashly yet they were afraid of them. I suppose Iosephus  means the Christians. All All ages agree that the Apostles were dispersed into several regions <a id="l1420"></a>at once, &amp; Origen has set down the time, telling us that in the <a id="l1421"></a>beginning of the Iudaic war the Apostles &amp; disciples of our <a id="l1422"></a>Lord were scattered into all nations, Thomas into Parthia, <a id="l1423"></a>Andrew into Scythia, Iohn into Asia, &amp; Peter first into <a id="l1424"></a>Asia were he preacht to the dispersion &amp; thence into Italy; <a id="l1425"></a>And Dionysius Corinthius saith that Peter went from Asia by <a id="l1426"></a>Corinth to Rome; &amp; all antiquity agree that Peter &amp; Paul <a id="l1427"></a>were martyred at Rome in the end of Nero's reign. Mark went <a id="l1428"></a>with Timothy to Rome (2 Tim 4.11 &amp; Colos. 4.10.) &amp; Sylvanus was Paul's <a id="l1429"></a>assistant, &amp; by these companions of Peter  mentioned in his first Epistle you <a id="l1430"></a>may know that he wrote from Rome: &amp; even all antiquity agree that in this Epistle <a id="l1431"></a>he understood Rome by Babylon. This Epistle was written to the strangers <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024r"> &lt;24r&gt; </span> strangers scattered throughout Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia &amp; Bithynia <a id="l1432"></a>&amp;  exhorts them to endure with  constancy &amp; chearfulness the fiery trial <a id="l1433"></a> or persecution which they were under. And therefore it was written after the <a id="l1434"></a>converted Iews under the care &amp; charge of Peter were  fled from  the troubles in Iudea &amp; Syria &amp; escaping  into those provinces of Asia, were there in affliction under the Gentiles who at this time looked upon all the Iews as public enemies The second Epistle of Peter was written to the <a id="l1440"></a>same dispersed strangers with the first (2 Pet. 3.1) &amp; therein he saith <a id="l1441"></a>that Paul had writ of the same things   [in his Epistle] <a id="l1442"></a>to them &amp; also in  all his epistles, speaking in them of these things <a id="l1443"></a>(2 Pet. 3.15, 16.) Paul did therefore write an Epistle to these strangers. And <a id="l1444"></a>as there is no other Epistle to them, besides that inscribed to the Hebrews so in <a id="l1445"></a>this epistle  (Chap. 10, 11, 12) you will find at large all those things which <a id="l1446"></a>Peter had been speaking of &amp; refers unto, &amp; particularly the passing away <a id="l1447"></a>of the old heaven &amp; earth &amp; establishing an inheritance immoveable <a id="l1448"></a>with an exhortation to grace because God (to the wicked) is a consuming <a id="l1449"></a>fire. Heb. 12.25, 26, 28, 29. In this Epistle Paul  exhorts the Hebrews  <a id="l1450"></a>(as Peter does in his epistles) to endure the chastening they lay under &amp; tells <a id="l1451"></a>them  that they had not yet resisted unto blood, &amp;   that the <a id="l1452"></a>brother Timothy was set at liberty with whom, if he came shortly to them <a id="l1453"></a>from Italy, he would also come &amp; see them. Whence I gather that these <a id="l1454"></a>Hebrews were the strangers in the Provinces of Asia to whome Peter wrote, <a id="l1455"></a>the Hebrews in Iudea having no concern nor acquaintance with Timothy, <a id="l1456"></a>&amp; that this epistle was written one or two years later then the second <a id="l1457"></a>Epistle to Timothy, &amp; that Paul as well as Timothy was set at liberty <a id="l1458"></a>before he wrote it.</p>
<p id="par76">It seems to me therefore that in  spring in the 19<sup>th</sup> year of Nero   the year before the Iewish war began <a id="l1459"></a> when the Iews in Iudea began to be very  seditious &amp; turbulent &amp; Florus   <a id="l1460"></a> brought his army against Ierusalem ✝✝ &amp; the troubles in Syria were not yet broke out. the Apostles &amp; their disciples being admonished from above  fled  form Iudea into <a id="l1462"></a>all parts &amp; Peter &amp; Iohn came with the greatest part of their Churches <a id="l1463"></a>through Syria into the Provinces of Asia where the Gospel had been spread. That in autumn following. , the Romans  to prevent such seditions  in  Asia as were then made  secured <a id="l1465"></a> by the Iews in  Iudea &amp; Syria secured the Leaders of the converted Iews &amp; Christians &amp; banished Iohn into Patmus &amp; treated the converted Iews <a id="l1466"></a>with the more hardship because they endeavoured by preaching the Gospel <a id="l1467"></a>to bring over the heathens to their party. That  &amp; wrote his first Epistle before winter or in summer following <a id="l1471"></a> That in this time of affliction the  Apocalypse was given to Iohn &amp; sent to the seven Churches  in the beginning of his banishment A.C. 65 as a reward &amp; consolation for their sufferings. And that Peter went on to Corinth &amp; thence to Rome before winter &amp;  sent his first Epistle the next summer &amp; his second Epistle the summer following. And that about the time that Peter wrote these Epistles Paul &amp; Timothy were set at liberty &amp; Paul wrote his Epistle to the Hebrews. And soon after, he &amp; Peter were martyred either in the 13<sup>th</sup> or 14<sup>th</sup> year of Nero. <a id="l1473"></a></p>

<p id="par82">Irenæus tells us that the Apostles made Linus Bishop  [of Rome] <a id="l1527"></a>&amp; that Linus was succeeded by Anacletus &amp; he by Clemens who had <a id="l1528"></a>seen the Apostles &amp; was their contemporary. And thence Epiphanius writes <a id="l1529"></a>that in Rome Peter &amp; Paul were the first both Apostles &amp; Bishops, then <a id="l1530"></a>Linus, then Cletus, then Clemens. And some later writers by leaving out Paul <a id="l1531"></a>have made Peter the first Bishop of Rome &amp; Linus the second. Whereas <a id="l1532"></a>Irenæus meant that the Apostles (Peter &amp; Paul or one of them) made Linus <a id="l1533"></a>bishop under them.  Pope Damasus writes that Peter <a id="l1534"></a> ordeined two Bishops <a id="l1535"></a>of Rome Linus &amp; Cletus &amp; appointed Clemens to succeed him. Whence <a id="l1536"></a>some make Linus &amp; Cletus coadjutors of Peter &amp; Clemens his first <a id="l1537"></a>successor. The truth is that the Apostles had a general unlimited power over all <a id="l1538"></a>cities by which they were able to to ordein bishops &amp; Presbyters of single cities,  and <a id="l1539"></a> Bishops had  a limited power of governing only theie own citys &amp; the territories of those cities, &amp; Linus was the <a id="l1540"></a>first bishop of Rome properly so called. And Linus being the disciple of <a id="l1541"></a>Paul &amp; an Italian its probable that he was ordeined Bishop before Peter came to Rome. <a id="l1542"></a>For why should Rome want a Bishop so long? Peter was an Apostle of the circumcision &amp; therefore no Bishop of the uncir<a id="l1543"></a>cumcision: for why should he leave his own charge to interfere with Paul? <a id="l1544"></a>If he was Bishop of Rome, pray, who ordeined him?  &amp; what universal authority <a id="l1545"></a>did the ordination give him  or what authority which he had not before? ? If he was not ordeined bishop of Rome but acted there as an Apostle, how <a id="l1546"></a>was he bishop of Rome more then of any other city? &amp; how can the Bishops <a id="l1547"></a>of Rome claim to be his successors without claiming to succeed him in his <a id="l1548"></a>Apostleship, &amp; by consequence to be Apostles. The Bishops of the whole world <a id="l1549"></a>succeeded the Apostles as truly as Linus did, but not in their Apostolic authority <a id="l1550"></a> The Apostles gave them a limited power over their several cities, &amp; Linus might succeed them without  <a id="l1551"></a> having a greater power then in proportion to his city. <em class="underline">Tu es Petrus</em> respected Peter not as a Bishop but as an Apostle. If it relates to bishops it belongs  <a id="l1552"></a>belongs  to all bishops &amp; if any have the preeminence they are the <a id="l1553"></a>Churches originally erected by the preaching of Peter in Phenicia &amp; Syria 31 years together &amp; then translated into  Asia minor, especially the seven Churches  chosen by Christ to <a id="l1554"></a>represent the Church catholic under the type of the  seven Candlesticks <a id="l1555"></a>of the Temple, whose Lamps illuminate the whole Temple. This is the <a id="l1556"></a>Church which was built upon a rock by the preaching of Peter &amp; the  Gates of Hell (the Elders in the Gates of great Babylon of the Presbytery of the synagogue of Satan) <a id="l1558"></a>shall not prevail against the remnant of her seed. This Church is the glorious woman in heaven ‡</p>

<p id="par83">‡ This church is the glorious woman in  the Temple of heaven at Ierusalem; Rome is the seven hilled city  in the wilderness of Babylon, reigning over the kings of the earth <a id="l1559"></a>&amp; these two differed from one another till the woman, by flying from the Temple into the wilderness, <a id="l1560"></a>changed her seat, &amp; for the future sat upon the seven hills. Paul opposed Peter &amp; therefore was <a id="l1561"></a>not under his government. Much less was Iohn under the government of Linus Cletus &amp; Clemens. <a id="l1562"></a>nore were the Churches of Asia under the government of those bishops while they were under the <a id="l1563"></a>government of Iohn. nor did Iohn teach his churches to submit to the Bishop of Rome after his <a id="l1564"></a>death: for if he had, they would have submitted; &amp; therefore he knew nothing of the Popes supremacy. <a id="l1565"></a>  Vpon a dispute arising between the Churches <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025v"> &lt;25v&gt; </span>  of Asia &amp; those of Italy about the keeping of Easter. Polycarp a very ancient man  who had <a id="l1566"></a>conversed with several that had seen Christ &amp; who was one of the disciples of Iohn the Apostle <a id="l1567"></a>came to Rome &amp;  upon discoursing the matter with Anicetus Bishop of Rome Polycarp did not yeild, but both parties <a id="l1568"></a>acquiesced in the tradition &amp; practise of their own Churches &amp; communicated with one another <a id="l1569"></a>their own way without contending further about it. This was  towards the end of  <a id="l1570"></a> the reign of Antoninus Pius, about the year  of Christ 198. Afterwards when Victor <a id="l1571"></a> bishop of Rome revived the controversy &amp; threatned to excommunicate <a id="l1572"></a>the Churches of Asia,  the Bishops of Egypt &amp; the west generaly certifyed that <a id="l1573"></a> their churches by immemorial tradition kept Easter  on the same day with the Church of &amp; yet upon being put in mind of what passed between <a id="l1575"></a>Polycarp &amp; Anicetus, they perswaded Victor to desist &amp;  not disturb the peace of the  Church of about a ceremony. All which appears by a part of a letter of Irenæus conscried by Euse<a id="l1579"></a>bius<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> Cum beate Polycarpus – – – inter se fruebatur. Henceforward <a id="l1580"></a>therefore the Churches of Asia continued to keep Easter on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of the Iewish <a id="l1581"></a>month till the  western Bishops revived the controversy &amp; in the <a id="l1582"></a>Council of Arles  convened by Constantine the great A.C. 314 decreed that <a id="l1583"></a>Easter should be kept on  one &amp; the same day throughout all the world &amp; that the <a id="l1584"></a>Bishop of Rome by his letters should signify the day to all as was usual, &amp; the Council <a id="l1585"></a>of Nice by the influence of Constantine the great A.C. 325 made the same decree, &amp;  referred it to the Bishop <a id="l1587"></a>of Alexandria to determin the day &amp; signify it to the Churches. And because  <a id="l1588"></a>the ablest Astronomers were in Egypt, he signified  the day also to the Bishop of Rome that the <a id="l1589"></a>eastern &amp; western churches might keep Easter on the same day.   In <a id="l1590"></a>all this time the Churches of Asia did not submit to the Bishop of Rome:  On the contrary the Western Bishops told  Victor that he ought not to <a id="l1596"></a>molest the Churches of Asia about this matter; Polycarp &amp; Anycetus parted good <a id="l1597"></a>friends upon equal terms; &amp; Iohn the Apostle was above all Bishops  &amp; governed <a id="l1598"></a>the Bishops of the Churches of Asia immediately. The Apocalyps was given by God to Christ who sent <a id="l1599"></a>his Messenger with it to Iohn &amp; Iohn by divine inspiration sent it to the seven Churches. <a id="l1600"></a>Here's a continual subordination of powers without the intervention of the Church of <a id="l1601"></a>Rome. The Churches of Asia were so far from allowing themselves subordinate to <a id="l1602"></a>the powers of the Bishops of Rome that  the Bishops of Rome themselves so far as I can <a id="l1603"></a>find, did not begin to pretend  any power over the eastern churches till after the <a id="l1604"></a>death of Constantine the great</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 25r resumes &gt; </span>
