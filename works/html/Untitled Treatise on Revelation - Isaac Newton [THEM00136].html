<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">The Proof</h2>
<p id="par1">Now although these interpretations by their analogy with one another &amp; resemblance to the things signified, may seem plain enough, yet that nothing be wanting to establish them, I shall further show their consent with the scriptures, &amp; also  with the translation of the Chalde Paraphrast &amp; with the  ancient doctrin of the Eastern interpreters (of Dreams  ) as it is recorded by Achmet an Arabian out of the ancient monuments of Ægypt Persia &amp; India.<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the right margin of f 1r &gt; </span> For since these nations anciently bordering upon the  Hebrews had great affinity with them both in Language &amp; manners, &amp; therefore wee scruple not to learn from them the use of words &amp; phrases in the scripture,  much less need we  scruple  to learn from them the use of  figurative expressions wherin their severall nations were much better agreed than in the language of the common people. For the Prophets without doubt spake in a dialect then commonly known to the more understanding sort of men, &amp; many of their types &amp; figures which are unusuall &amp; difficult to us appear by these records of Achmet to have been very familiar to those Eastern nations; at least among the interpreters. And  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span> therefore esteeming it pertinent to show the consent of our interpretations with the doctrin of these interpreters next after their consent with the scriptures: I proceed.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 1r resumes &gt; </span>  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> </p>
<p id="par2">1. The comparison of a Kingdom  to the   World may appear out of Isa 51.16 where the new founding of the political world or Kingdom of the Iews is exprest by planting the Heavens &amp; laying the foundations of the Earth. <em class="underline">I have put my words in thy mouth &amp; have covered thee in the shaddow of mine hand that I may plant the heavens &amp;  lay the foundations of the earth, &amp; say unto Zion, Thou art my people</em>. See the Calde Paraphrast. In the same sence is Heaven &amp; earth to be taken in Isa: 1.2.  Hagg: 2.21. &amp;c</p>
<p id="par3">2.  <sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> ] When Ioseph dreamed that the sun Moon &amp; eleven Stars should do obesance to him, Iacob interprets it of himself his wife &amp; Sons comparing his Family to the Vnivers as if it were a little Kingdom Gen 37. <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Sun immutably represents the King, the Moon the next in power to the King, the Planet Venus the Queen, the rest of the greater stars the great men of the Kingdom. Achmet. chap 167. Ind. Pers. Eg. Yet Lucifer which is the same with Venus does sometimes signify a King as in Isa 14.12, where the King of Babylon is called by this name; suppose in respect of God or  Christ the  King of  Kings.</p>
<p id="par4"> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> </p>
<p id="par5">4. There is nothing more usuall then to put the Earth for the Nations of the Earth, or for the common people of any great Kingdom: as in these expressions. Let all the Earth prais the Lord. He causeth the Earth &amp; them that dwell therein to worship the first beast Rev. 13.12. Hear o Heavens &amp; give ear o Earth Isa 1 2. [Sing O Heavens, &amp; be joyfull O Earth &amp; break forth into singing o Mountains: for the Lord hath comforted his people. Isa 49:13. &amp;c.]</p>
<p id="par6">5. The <em class="underline">Waters</em> where the Whore sitteth are peoples &amp; multitudes &amp; nations &amp; tongues Rev 17.15. I saw a Beast rise up out of the <em class="underline">Sea</em>. i.e. out of the aggregate of the waters where the Whore sitteth Rev. 13.1. How is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations! the <em class="underline">Sea</em> (i.e. the Kingdom of the  Medes) is come upon Babylon she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof, her cities are a desolation &amp;c Ier 51.42.  <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If any man dream he is Lord of the <em class="underline">Sea</em> he will be successor in the whole Kingdom. Ach. c. 178. Ind. Pers. Eg. So the Chalde Paraphrast for waters substitutes people in Ier 47.2 &amp; Ezek 26.19 &amp;c</p>
<p id="par7">6. Hurt not the <em class="underline">Earth</em> nor the <em class="underline">Sea</em> Rev 7.3. that is the two sorts of people signified by the earth &amp; the sea, as is expounded in ch 12.12: Wo be to the inhabitants of the earth &amp; of the Sea. ffor these are two sorts of people because the Earth was hurt in the first Trumpet &amp; the Sea in the second. </p>

Let thy fury be turned away from thy City Ierusalem thy holy <em class="underline">Mountain</em> Dan 9.16. Whilst I was presenting my supplication – for the holy <em class="underline">Mountain</em> of my God, vers 20.  So in Dan 2 The new Ierusalem extending its dominion over the earth is represented by a great mountain which filled the whole Earth. <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I will render unto <em class="underline">Babylon</em> – all the evil that they have done in Zion – Behold I am against the o destroying <em class="underline">Mountain</em> saith the Lord which destroyest all the earth – thou shalt be desolate for ever Ier 51.24, 25, 26. Who art thou O great <em class="underline">mountain</em>? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain i.e. the City Babylon Zech 4:7. The burden of Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amos did see: Lift ye up a banner upon the high <em class="underline">Mountain</em> Isa: 13.2 I will lay the Land most desolate &amp; the pomp of her strength shall cease, &amp; the <em class="underline">Mountains</em> (i.e. Cities) of Israel shall be desolate. Ezek 33.28.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; insertion from f 2v &gt; </span>
<p id="par10">7. Of Ierusalem's being called a Mountain there are many instances, as in Zech 8.3: Ierusalem shall be called a city of truth &amp; the mountain of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003v"> &lt;3v&gt; </span> Lord of hosts, the holy Mountain. So in Dan 9.16. Let thy fury be turned away from thy City Ierusalem thy holy Mountain Dan 9.16. The like in Dan 9.20. Ier 17.3. Isa 27.13, &amp; 66.10 &amp;c.</p>
<p id="par11">So of Babylon. I will render unto Babylon — all the evill that they have done in Zion — Behold I am against the O destroying Mountain saith the Lord which destroyest all the earth — thou shalt be desolate for ever. Ier 51.24, 25, 26. Who art thou O great Mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain. Zech 4.7. The burden of Babylon which Isaias the Son of Amos did see: lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain. Chal. Par. upon the City which dwels securely. Isa 13.2.</p>
<p id="par12">So of Cities in generall: I will lay the land most desolate &amp; the pomp of her strength shall cease, &amp; the Mountains of Israel shall be desolate Ezek 33.28. Thou hast said, by the multitude of my Chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains Chal. Par. to the strong holds of the Cities. Isa 37.24</p>
<p id="par13">Sometimes a mountain is extended to signify the whole dition of a city as in Dan 2.35 &amp; Isa 11.9, much after the same manner that a King is sometimes put for his kingdom.</p>
<p id="par14">8. And sometimes it signifies onely a Temple. Ierusalem shall become heaps, &amp; the Mountain –</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 4r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par15">8. Ierusalem shall become heaps, &amp; the <em class="underline">Mountain of the house</em> as the <em class="underline">high-places</em>of the Forrest: But in the last days it shall come to pass that the <em class="underline">Mountain of the house of the Lord</em> shal be established in the top of the Mountains &amp; it shall be exalted above the hills &amp;c i.e. above all other temples. Mica 3.12.  <span class="hspac-n" title="4 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A voice was heard upon the <em class="underline">high-places</em> — Return ye back sliding children – in vain is salvation hoped for from the <em class="underline">hills</em> &amp; from the multitude of the <em class="underline">Mountains</em>: truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel. Ier 3.21, 22. <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The reason of this signification of a Mountain I suppose is because Idol-temples were usually placed upon the tops of Mountains <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> as may appear out of Deutr 12.2: Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall posses served their Gods upon the high Mountains &amp; upon the hills:  And also because of the  greatnes of the buildings &amp; height of their Altars whence they are frequently called high places in scripture. [anding that they are sometimes in Valleys, as in Ier 7.31: They have <em class="underline">built</em> the <em class="underline">high-places</em> of Tophet which is in the <em class="underline">Valley</em> of the Son of Hinnon.]</p>
<p id="par16"> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the right margin of f 5r &gt; </span> </p>
<p id="par17">9. That Dens &amp; Rocks signify buildings is obvious from the resemblance which Dens have to their Rooms or to the Cavities of their ruins, &amp; Rocks to their outside. And moreover that  this is their meaning in scripture may appear by the following instances. The multitude of –<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 5r resumes &gt; </span> The multitude of the City shall be left, the forts &amp; towers shall be Dens for ever Isa 32.14. I will make Ierusalem heaps &amp; a Den of Dragons Ier 9.11   </p>
<p id="par18">The pride of thine heart (O Edom) hath deceived thee thou that dwellest in the clifts of the <em class="underline">Rock</em> whose habitation is high, that saith in his heart who shall bring me down to the ground Obad 3. *<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the right margin of f 5r &gt; </span> * Although this be an allusion to the high country of the Edomites, yet I take it to be meant rather of their sumptuous buildings &amp; Palaces then naturall rocks, becaus it is made a character of their pride, &amp; it is no argument of pride merely to dwell in a high &amp; rocky Country. In the same sense I understand also the following places. Let the wildernes &amp; the cities thereof lift up their voice the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the Rock sing let them shout from the top of the mountains. (i.e. of the Cities) Isa 42.<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>11<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 5r resumes &gt; </span> Behold I am against thee (the house of David) O inhabitant of the Valley &amp; <em class="underline">rock</em> of the plain saith the Lord; which say, Who shall come down against us or who shall enter into our habitations? Ier 21.13. Behold I am against thee o destroying Mountain (i.e. Babylon) saith the Lord — I will roll the down from the <em class="underline">rocks</em> &amp; make thee a <em class="underline">burnt</em> Mountain. Ier 51.25. They shall destroy the walls of Tyrus &amp; break down her towers &amp; I will also scrape her dust from her &amp; make her like the top of a <em class="underline">rock</em>. Ezek. 26.4, 14. ***</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; insertion from f 5v &gt; </span>
<p id="par19">*** 10. To these instances of common buildings may be added those  two that follow of Temples. Is this house which is called by my name become a Den of Robbers? i.e. An Idol-Temple. Ier 7.11 Are ye not the children of transgression —  that is under the Idol Temples or high-places of Topheth which they built for that purpose in the Valley of the Son of Hinnon Ier 7.31 &amp; 19.5 &amp; 32.35. Other instances of this see in  the comment on Def. 64.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 5r resumes &gt; </span> Are ye not the children of  transgression, a seed of falshood, inflaming yourselves with Idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the Valleys under the clifts of the <em class="underline">rocks</em>? Isa 57.5: that is, under Idol-temples, as <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> may appear by comparing this place with Ier 7 31: They have built <em class="underline">high places</em> of Topheth which is in the Valley of the son of Hinnon, to burn their sons &amp; their daughters in the fire. See also Ier 19.5 &amp; 32.35 &amp;c</p>

<p id="par21">  63) That Idols may be called men is according to the common way <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> of speaking. ffor they are Images of Men, &amp; as we are wont to call the Image of a Beast a Beast &amp; the Image of a Bird a Bird, so we call the Image of a man a man. </p>
<p id="par22">  And as this is the common way of speaking so it is the Language of the scripturs. Thou hast played the Harlot with many <em class="underline">lovers</em> yet return to me saith the Lord – she defiled the Land &amp; committed adultery with stones &amp; with stocks. Ier 3.1, 9.

<p id="par56">31 It is usually supposed that the Vices of nations were the reason why in Daniel &amp; the Apocalyps they are represented by Beasts and  this may be sometimes allowed for a secondary reason especially in the Apocalyps but I cannot think it the authentic reason becaus a beast may as well be taken in a good sence as in a bad one. For christ is represented by a Lyon as well as Nebuchadnezzar, &amp; some of the 12 Tribes <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span> are characterised by Beasts in  Iacob's blessing as well as the 4 Monarchies in Daniels visions. And therefore I must rather derive this Type from Armies whereby Kingdoms are usually founded &amp; upheld. For since Armies are  wild beasts by Def <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>, it is thence very naturall to put a Beast for  any Kingdom which was originated from Armies &amp; frequently imploys them like a ravenous Beast to  prey upon its neighbours. And this the prophetique doctrin of Iacob may teach us, who called Iudah a Lyon from his getting the prey &amp; being prince of the Tribes, Issachar an Ass from his being in slavery, Dan a serpent from laying stratagems &amp; Benjamin a wolf from ravening &amp; devouring the prey. And so the descriptions of the  Beasts  in Daniel almost wholly respect their pugnaciousnes excepting what is said of the little horn. And in the Apocalyps although the two-hornd Beast be not represented pugnacious, yet its merchants (chap 18) supply the place of Armies, since they prey upon the Kings of the earth by their sophistical merchandise no less then the other by force.</p>
<p id="par57">32. A Dragon signifies the person of a <em class="underline">hostile</em> King, &amp; serpents according to their bignes the persons of other greater or lesser enemies Achm: c 283. According to which doctrin the Apocalyptic Dragon is a very proper emblem as well of the Roman Kingdom which was so great an enemy to the Church, as of the Devil that arch-enemy to mankind. But there seems to be in this emblem a further mystery; namely to insinuate a comparison of the oppression of the Church under the Roman Empire to the Egyptian Bondage, as if that were a type of this. For it is observable that although the Iews had many enemies yet none but Pharaoh is represented by a Dragon in the old Prophets. And he is so represented as may be seen in Ezek 29.3. Isa 51.9. Psalm 74 13, &amp; Isa 27.1. In which last places Pharaoh in respect of the overflowing Nilus is also called Leviathan as if he were a water Dragon like that in the Apocalyps who cast out of his mouth water as a flood. And so in Psalm 74 he is represented with many heads like the same Apocalyptic Dragon. But for the fuller analogy of these two Dragons I must refer you to the comment <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017r"> &lt;17r&gt; </span> on Rev 11.8.</p>
<p id="par58">33 Heads are sometimes collaterall parts of a kingdom, as the four heads of the Leopard in Dan 7.6. But if the kingdom be divided into both collaterall &amp; successive parts, then may the successive parts be represented by Heads, as in the Apocalyptic Beast whose seven heads appear to be successive by the saying that Five are fallen &amp; the other is not yet come Rev 17 10.</p>
<p id="par59">34 Horns if they appear together, denote collaterall parts of a Kingdom or of that head of it upon which they grow, as the four horns of the Gote Dan 8.8 &amp; the 10 horns of the Beast Dan 7. Rev 17.12.   If the Horns Heads &amp; Body of a Beast be  considered strictly according to their relation one among another, the horns as being the most exalted member will chiefly respect Kings or successions of them, the Heads the Nobles &amp; great men &amp; the Body the rest of the Kingdom. But becaus a King is sometimes put for his Kingdom, thence it is that a horn is also sometimes used in the same signification.</p>
<p id="par60">35. Eyes being the  chief organs by which a man acquires knowledg, are the most proper emblem thereof. And hence was that  known Hieroglyphic of the Ægyptians: A scepter with an eye on the top of it to signify the policy &amp; foresight requisite in a King.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; insertion from f 16v &gt; </span>
<p id="par61">36. The signification of Mouth is plain from hence that the 4<sup>th</sup> Beast had a mouth speaking great things – even great words against the most high, &amp; should think to change times &amp; laws,    &amp; they should be given into his hands for a while Dan 1.20, 25.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 17r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par62">37. Teeth  must signify great men becaus they are in the head, &amp; those souldiers becaus they are the chief instruments wherewith a Beast fights. Hence to expres the fortitude of the fourth Beast, it is described with great iron teeth. And so the Locusts Ioel 1.6 &amp; Rev 9.8 are represented with  teeth of Lyons. And probably the Author of the fable of Cadmus had respect to this signification of teeth when he made the Dragons teeth to be the seed of armed Souldiers.</p>
<p id="par63">38 The feet very fitly represent common souldiers. For as they are the most active members, &amp; the lowest parts of Beast, &amp; serve to support him, &amp; to move upon &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span> to fight with: so Armies are much in motion, &amp; the lowest of the people, &amp; the support of the kingdom, &amp; by them Kingdoms are translated to &amp; fro, &amp; they are the members wherewith Kingdoms fight. This interpretation is also evident by the Visions of Daniel. For the ten horned Beast to signify the use &amp; power of his feet in fighting is represented with nails of Bras &amp; said to stamp with his feet what he devoured not with his teeth: which is as much as to say, that what the Commanders left the inferior souldiers spoiled. And so the he-Goat stamped upon the Ram &amp; therefore fought with his feet. And that of Ezek 32.2 Thou troubledst the waters with thy feet, the Chalde Paraphrast renders thus: Thou  disquietedst the peoples with thy armies.</p>
<p id="par64">39 The tayle also, at least where feet are not considered may properly represent Armies, as being the train &amp; hinder end as it were of a kingdom. Achmet  saith: If one dream he rides on Pharas (i.e. a generous steed) having a thick set &amp; long tail, he shall have a train of attendants or followers answerable to the fulnes &amp; length of the tail, c 152. And by analogy the tail of a pugnacious Beast must be a train of souldiers. And this is confirmed in that the Euphratean Horsmen were said to do hurt with their tails, that is to fight with them, &amp; therefore least that should seem improper their tails are described to be like serpents to represent them capable of fighting with them. And for the same end the Locusts are described with stings in their tails.</p>
<p id="par65">40 Of the Body of the Beast see the comment on Def 34</p>
<p id="par66">Besides these there may be other ways of representing a kingdom, as if  a great fish be put for a King &amp;  lesser fishes for his subjects,  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018v"> &lt;18v&gt; </span> Ezek 29.4. or the Sea for a King &amp; rivers for his subjects &amp;c</p>

In like manner riding is put for reigning in Deutr 32.13. Isa 58.14. Psal 66.12 And so the woman's riding upon her Beast is interpreted her reigning over the Kings of the Earth Apoc 17. And Achmet delivers it for the doctrin of the Indians Persians &amp; Egyptians, That a generous Steed denotes eminence &amp; dignity, &amp; vulgar horses inferior nobility &amp; glory And if one dream he rides on a nimble &amp; mettlesome hors, he shall acquire amongst the people fame &amp; great renown, &amp; eminence &amp; honour. – And if he seem to ride armed on a generous steed he shall obtein power &amp; renown according to his armour. chap 233.</p>

Psal 62.9 Dan 5.27. or to Iustice as in Hosea 12.7. Micah 6.11, Prov 16.11 &amp;c. And  to the same sense is the Doctrin of Interpreters, which runs thus. If in a dream one see a Ballance poised in any place let him understand it of a Iudg. And if he have a caus &amp; see the ballance equally poised he shall obtein his right. — And if he see the Ballance exact &amp; clean let him know that the Iudg of that place is just, but if it be broken &amp; out of order <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span> he is unjust.

To assimilate sharp affliction to the pains of a woman is sufficiently obvious whence if that woman be the Church her pains in travail must  be an emblem of her persecution. Thus our Saviour in Mat 24.8, 9 &amp; Mark 13.9 describing the persecution of the church calls them ὠδινας. So Isaiah ch 66.7 speaking of the Iewish church saith before shee travailed she brought forth before her pain came she was delivered of a man child. Which the Chalde Paraphrast thus interprets Antequam veniat ei tribulatio redempta erit, antequam veniat ei tremor sicut dolores parturientis revelabitur Rex ejus. Ieremiah also in ch 30.6, 7 interprets this figure plainly. Ask ye now, saith he, &amp; see whither a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail, &amp; all faces are turned into paleness? Alas for that day is great so that none is like it, it is even the time of Iacobs trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.</p>

And though all their neighbours were Idolaters more then they  yet none but they are reproved for it under the character of  committing whoredom. And the reason is plain. ffor as that they were considered as married to the true God, Ier 3.1, 8, 14 Hosea 2.1, 7 &amp;c so the other nations had as it were contracted wedlock with fals Gods, insomuch that they are called the Gods of those nations as the true God was the God of the Iews. Yet Nineveh is once called a harlot (Nahum 3.4.) but not for Idolatry.</p>
<p id="par76">62 That Idolatry is sometimes termed Blasphemy may be seen in these instances.

Isa 65.7 And so in the Apocalyps, although Blasphemy need not there be wholly limited to Idolatry, yet the names of Blasphemy upon the Whore's Beast are well interpreted by Grotius to be the names of Idol-Gods by which the true God is blasphemed whilst men attribute that to them which is due onely to him.</p>

And  accordingly in Rev 17 by the inhabitants of the earth being made <em class="underline">drunk</em> with the wine of the Whores ffornication, must be understood their being infatuated &amp; seduced to Idolatry by her delusions. For it is said in ch 18.23 that by her deadly  Potion (ἐκ του φαρμακου) were all nations deceived. That is by the wine of the poison of her fornication ἐκ του ὀίνου του θυμου, as it is called in vers 3 &amp; 8. For θυμὸς signifies as well poison as wrath, &amp; her Cup is to be supposed, as it were, a Philtre or love-Potion, such as Whores were said to administer for inciting love, &amp; for that end to compose it of such poisonous medicaments as might work by stupifying &amp; infatuating those to whome they gave it.</p>

<p id="par86">45. Yet the celestiall bodies are not to be interpreted so strictly of the persons of Kings &amp; Princes but that the Sun &amp; Moon may sometimes be used to signify in generall the splendor &amp; glory of a kingdom,  in as much as the sun is the glory of the world by day &amp; the Moon by night. For thus the Chalde Paraphrast interprets them in Ier 15.9, &amp; Isa 60.20. And so where the Woman is said to be clothed with the Sun, &amp; the Moon under her feet Rev 12, the Sun &amp; Moon signify the glory of the righteousnes of Christ wherewith the church must be clothed, &amp; of her own righteousnes which  she must put of but yet be supported by it as it borrows splendor from that sun &amp; shines as it were by reflexion. And so where the sun is turned into blacknes &amp; the moon into blood Ioel 2.31 &amp; Rev 6.12 I had rather understand it in generall of the splendor of the Kingdom put out &amp; the glory turned into bloodshed, then interpret it onely of the King &amp; the next in dignity. For the perishing of those two persons infer not the overthrow of the Kingdom: whereas in Ioel the turning of the Sun into darknes &amp; the Moon into blood is made the description of that universall overthrow of the Gentile Kingdoms &amp; mighty slaughter of all their Armies which is to happen at the great day of God almighty, as is at large described in the next chapter.</p>
<p id="par87">As for the Moons being turned into blood the expression seems borrowed from the dusky reddish colour of the Moon in a partiall Eclips which is here rather alluded unto then the darknes of a totall Eclips, that  the great slaughter of the nations may be exprest by calling  the colour blood. ffor that this word was intended for an expression of their bloodshed is plain by the precedent sentence. I will shew wonders in the Heavens &amp; in the Earth, <em class="underline">blood</em> &amp; fire &amp; pillars of smoke (i.e. slaughter &amp; war) To which is subjoyned by way of explication: The sun shall be turned into darknes &amp; the Moon into blood before the great &amp; the terrible day of the Lord come.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 24r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par88">65 The falling of the stars &amp; departure of the heavens according to the  precedent interpretation of stars &amp; Heaven will signify the fall of great men &amp; the departure of the glory of a Kingdom. And becaus Idols are sometimes considered as men by Def 63 therefore this emblem may be applyed either to a Kingdom of Idols or to a Kingdom of men, as the circumstances shall require. Thus Saint Stephen calls the Idol of Rempham a Star, saying: Ye  took up  the Tabernacle of Moloch &amp; the Star of your God Rempham figures which ye made to worship them. Acts 7.43. It is indeed less usuall to represent Idols by the stars but it is more proper, becaus they being the  Images of supposed celestial Gods,  were thence in scripture called Gods &amp; the host of heaven: &amp; the analogy between the Vnivers &amp; a kingdom will be more perfect when things  which relate to heaven are represented by the heavenly bodies, &amp; the  parts of a Kingdom which respect the earth by things on the Earth then when they are confounded together: Yea this the scripture seems to insinuate when it calls Idols as well as stars the host of heaven And therefore we need not doubt to interpret stars of Idols &amp; Heaven of their honour &amp; dignity or rather of the  orbicular roofs of their Temples, whenever that interpretation will best agree with the circumstances. And thus it happens in this definition. For here the allusions to the falling of Figs from a fig-tree &amp; to the rolling of a scroll together, do by striking the imagination with an Idea of local motion make it a more lively representation of the ruining of a Kingdom of Idol-Gods then of a Kingdom of men. For the stars falling unto the earth as figs fall from a fig tree do most lively represent falling Idols, &amp; Heaven departing as a Scroll <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025r"> &lt;25r&gt; </span> when it is rolled together, the roof of a Temple gradually taken off, or cleaving asunder at its being thrown down.</p>
<p id="par89">As for the use of this emblem there are but two places where it occurs, viz: Isa: 34.4 &amp; Rev 6.13, 14: The first of these seems to respect that universall overthrow of the Gentiles so often prophesied of in Scripture; at which time Idolatry is to be universally &amp; forever demolished, as may hereafter appear by comparing Rev 9.20 &amp; 11.15 with Isa 2.17, 18, 19 &amp; Zech 13.2 &amp;c. And concerning this place it may be observed that the stars which fall down are not called the stars but the host of heaven <span class="hspac-n" title="7 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> which is the same name by which Idols are often called &amp; therefore it may as well signify Idols as stars. The other place is at the sixt Seale when Idols were to be universally abolished but not for ever: of which more hereafter.</p>
<p id="par90">64 In Def 10 &amp; 63 we shewed that the Prophets put men for Idols, &amp; Dens &amp; Rocks of Mountains for their Temples: &amp; the reason of the thing requires that here they should be thus interpreted. For Rocks &amp; Mountains must here signify buildings becaus of their falling, &amp; Men must signify Idols becaus to hide in Dens  or holes of Rocks or to cover with falling mountains that is, to shut up in buildings or bury in the ruins of them is the proper way of destroying Idols but not a proper way of destroying men. But the use of these expressions will best appear out of scripture where they are appropriated to the demolishing of Idolatry. The high places of Aven the sin of Israel shall be destroyed the Thorn &amp; Thistle shall come upon their <em class="underline">Altars</em>, &amp; they shall say to the <em class="underline">mountains</em> cover us &amp; to the <em class="underline">hills</em> fall on us Hosea 10.8. The Lord alone shall be ex<a id="l3"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span>alted in that day &amp; the Idols shall he utterly *<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>  abolish, &amp; they shall go into the holes of the <em class="underline">Rocks</em> &amp; into the Caves of the Earth for fear of the Lord Isa 2.19. In that day shall a man cast his Idols — to the Moles &amp; to the Bats to go into the clefts of the Rock &amp; into the *<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup>  tops of the ragged rocks for fear of the Lord vers 21. Here the Idols which are to be hid in the rocks are called by the name of Idols but a little before they were spoken unto as men. Enter into the Rock &amp; hide thee in the dust vers 10. And therefore since the men here spoken unto are Idols,  by men hiding themselves in rocks must be understood Idols shut up in their temples or buried in the ruins thereof.</p>
<p id="par91">47. To expres the ruin of old Babylon Ieremiah commanded Serajah saing: When thou hast made an end of reading this book thou shalt bind a stone to it &amp; cast it into the midst of Euphrates, &amp; thou shalt say; Thus shall Babylon sink, &amp;c Ier 51.63. So to expres the ruin of new Babylon a mighty Angel took up a stone like a great Milstone &amp; cast it into the sea, saying: Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down &amp;c. Rev: 18.21. And to these two places the casting of the great Mountain into the sea Rev 8.8 seems to allude:  especially since that Mountain signifies also a City by Def <span class="hspac-n" title="4 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>  not to mention here that it is the very same  with new Babylon. And so by Analogy the falling of the great star upon the rivers Rev 8.10 must signify the ruin of some great Prince. To which purpose the Indian Interpreters teach us: If one dream he sees the stars fall into the sea, let him understand thereby a slaughter of men to be caused by the King, &amp; if the King have this dream he shall see a very great slaughter or mortality of his people. Achm. c: 170.</p>
<p id="par92">46. Since waters signify people, the turning of them to blood must signify slaughter of the people. Thus the desolation of Moab <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027r"> &lt;27r&gt; </span> is exprest by saying: The waters of Dimon shall be ful of blood. Isa 15.9.

In that day will I make the  Governours of Iudah like a hearth of fire among the wood &amp; like a torch of fire in a sheaf, &amp; they shall devour all the people round about. Zech 12.6 The strength of the Battel – hath set him on fire round about yet he knew not, it burned him yet he laid it not to heart. Isa 42.25. The Lord called thy name a green Olive tree – – with the nois of a great tumult he hath kindled a fire upon <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p028r"> &lt;28r&gt; </span> it. Ier 11.16.
