Whence came the division of the Ecliptick into 360 degrees. So in the time of Noahs <a id="l16"></a>flood when the Moon could not be seen, Noah rec<a id="l17"></a>coned 30 days to a month.

Cleobulus<sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> one of the seven wise men <a id="l59"></a>of Greece alluded to this year of the Greeks in his Parable of one <a id="l60"></a>father who had twelve sons each of which had thirty <a id="l61"></a>daughters half white &amp; half black &amp; Thales<sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup>  called the last day of the <a id="l64"></a>month τριακαδα the thirtieth. And Solon counted the ten last days of the month back<a id="l65"></a>wards from the thirtieth, calling that day ἔνην καὶ νέαν <a id="l66"></a>the old &amp; the new. He introduced months of 29 &amp; 30 <a id="l67"></a>days alternately, making the thirtieth day of every <a id="l68"></a>other month to be the first day of the next month.</p>
<p id="par3">To the twelve Lunar months<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> the ancient Greeks <a id="l71"></a>added a thirteenth every other year,which made their <a id="l72"></a>Dietens . And because this recconing made their year <a id="l73"></a>too long by a month in eight years, they omitted an in<a id="l74"></a>tercalary month once in eight years, which made their <a id="l75"></a>Octaeteris, one half of which was their Tetracteris. <a id="l76"></a>And these periods seem to have been as old as the religi<a id="l77"></a>ons of Greece, being used in divers of their sacra. The <a id="l78"></a>Octaeteris<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> was the Annus magnus of Cadmus &amp; Minos <a id="l82"></a>&amp; seems to have been brought into Greece &amp; Crete <a id="l83"></a>by the Phenicians who came with Cadmus &amp; Europa &amp; to have continued till after the days of Herodotus. <a id="l84"></a>For in counting the length of seventy years<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> he reccons <a id="l85"></a>30 days to a lunar month &amp; twelve such months or 360 days to the ordinary year without the intercalary <a id="l86"></a>months &amp; 25 such months to the Dieteris. And ac<a id="l87"></a>cording to the number of days in the Calendar year of <a id="l88"></a>the Greeks, Demetrius Phaloreus had 360 statues <a id="l89"></a>erected to him by the Athenians. But the Greeks Cleo<a id="l90"></a>stratus Harpalus &amp; others to make their months agree better <a id="l91"></a>with the course of the Moon, in the days of the Persian – <a id="l92"></a>Empire, varied the manner of intercaling the three months <a id="l93"></a>of the Octaeteris, intercaling a month in the second fourth &amp; <a id="l94"></a>seventh year or in the third fifth &amp; eigth year or there sixt &amp; eighth, &amp; Meton <a id="l95"></a>found out the Cycle of intercaling seven months in 19 years.</p>
<p id="par4">The ancient year of the Egyptians was also Lunisolar <a id="l96"></a>&amp; continued to be so till the days of Hyperion or Osiris a <a id="l97"></a>king of Egypt the father of Helius &amp; Selene or Orus &amp; <a id="l98"></a>Bubaste. For the Israelites brought this year out of Egypt <a id="l99"></a>&amp; Diodorus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> tells us that Vranus the father of Hyperion <a id="l100"></a>used this year &amp;<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> that in the temple of Osiris the Priests <a id="l101"></a>appointed thereunto filled 360 milk bowles every day. I <a id="l102"></a>think he means one bowle every day, in all 360, to count <a id="l103"></a>the number of days in the Calendar year, &amp; thereby to <a id="l104"></a>find the difference between this &amp; the true solar year. For <a id="l105"></a>this was the year to the end of which they added five days.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span>
<p id="par5">That the Israelites used the Lunisolar year is beyond <a id="l106"></a>question. Their months began with their new moons; <a id="l107"></a>their first month was called Abib from the earing of <a id="l108"></a>corn in that month; their Passover was kept upon the <a id="l109"></a>14<sup>th</sup> day of the first month the Moon being then in the <a id="l110"></a>full; &amp; the first fruits of the corn were offered in that festival <a id="l111"></a>&amp; the harvest got in before the Pentecost; &amp; the other <a id="l112"></a>fruits gathered before the feast of the seventh month. <a id="l113"></a>David had only twelve courses of guards for the twelve <a id="l114"></a>months of the year, but it is to be understood that when <a id="l115"></a>a thirteenth month was added to the year, the course <a id="l116"></a>which was to serve upon the first month of the next <a id="l117"></a>year, served upon the intercalary month &amp; the next <a id="l118"></a>course served upon the first month of the next year, <a id="l119"></a>&amp; so on perpetually.</p>
<p id="par6">Simplicius in his Commentary<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> on the 5<sup>t</sup> of Aristotels <a id="l122"></a>Physical Aeroasis, tells us that <em class="underline">some begin the year <a id="l123"></a>upon the Summer Solstice, as the people of Attica, <a id="l124"></a>or upon the autumnal Equinox, as the people of Asia, <a id="l125"></a>or in winter as the Romans, or about the Vernal <a id="l126"></a>Equinox, as the Arabians &amp; people of Damascus: &amp; <a id="l127"></a>the month began according to some, upon the full <a id="l128"></a>Moon, or upon the new.</em> The years of all these na<a id="l129"></a>tions were therefore Luni–solar, &amp; kept to the four <a id="l130"></a>seasons. The ancient civil year of the Assyrians &amp; <a id="l131"></a>Babylonians was also Lunisolar. For this year was used <a id="l132"></a>by the Samaritans who came from several parts of the <a id="l133"></a>Assyrian Empire; &amp; the Iews who came from Babylon, <a id="l134"></a>called the months of their Luni–solar year after the <a id="l135"></a>names of the months of the Babylonian year. And Be<a id="l136"></a>rosus<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> tells us that the Babylonians celebrated the feast <a id="l138"></a>Sacea upon the 16<sup>th</sup> day of the month Lous, which was a <a id="l139"></a>Lunar month of the Macedonians, &amp; kept to one &amp; the <a id="l140"></a>same season of the year. And the Arabians, a nation <a id="l141"></a>who peopled Babylon, use Lunar months to this day. And <a id="l142"></a>Suidas<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> tells us that the Sarus of the Chaldeans conteins 222 <a id="l144"></a>Lunar months, which are  eighteen years consisting each of twelve Lunar <a id="l146"></a>months, besides six intercalary months.  For in this Period &amp; <a id="l150"></a>another Lunar month, the motions of the Moon returned to <a id="l151"></a>their former course very nearly. And when <a id="l152"></a>Cyrus<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup> cut the river Gindes into 360 channels, he seems to <a id="l153"></a>have alluded unto the number of days in the Calendar year <a id="l154"></a>of the Medes &amp; Persians.</p>
<p id="par7">At length the Egyptians for the sake of navigation <a id="l155"></a>applied themselves to  observe the stars, &amp; by their <a id="l156"></a>heliacal risings &amp; settings found the true solar year to <a id="l157"></a>be five days longer then the Calendar year, &amp; thereupon <a id="l158"></a>added five days to the twelve equal Calendar months, <a id="l159"></a>making the solar year to consist of twelve months &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> five days. Strabo <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup> &amp; Diodorus<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup> ascribe this invention to <a id="l162"></a>to the Egyptians of Thebes. <em class="underline">The Theban Priests,</em> saith Stra<a id="l163"></a>bo, <em class="underline">are above others said to be Astronomers &amp; Philosophers <a id="l164"></a>They invented the recconing of the days not by the course of the Moon but by the course of the Sun. To twelve months <a id="l165"></a>each of 30 days they add yearly five days.</em> In memory <a id="l166"></a>of this emendation of the year they dedicated<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup> the five <a id="l169"></a>additional days to Osiris Isis Orus senior Typhon &amp; <a id="l170"></a>Nephthe the wife of Typhon, feigning that those days <a id="l171"></a>were added to the year when these five Princes were born. <a id="l172"></a>that is, in the reign of Ammon the father of Sesac. And in the Sepulchre<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup> of Amenophis who reigned soon <a id="l174"></a>after, they placed a circle of 365 cubits in compass <a id="l175"></a>covered on the upper side with a plate of gold &amp; divided <a id="l176"></a>it into 365 equal parts to represent all the days in <a id="l177"></a>the year, &amp; noted upon each part the heliacal risings <a id="l178"></a>&amp; settings of the stars on that day: which circle re<a id="l179"></a>mained there till the  invasion of Egypt by Cambyses King of Persia. In the reign <a id="l180"></a>of Vranus the father of Hyperion &amp; grandfather of Helins <a id="l181"></a>&amp; Selene the Thebans applied themselves to Navigation &amp; Astronomy, &amp; by the heliacal risings of the starrs deter<a id="l182"></a>mined the length of the solar year. And in the reign <a id="l183"></a>of Amenophis when by further Observations they had <a id="l184"></a>sufficiently determined the  time of the sum<a id="l185"></a>mer solstice, they might place the beginning of this <a id="l186"></a>new year upon the Vernal Equinox. And this year being <a id="l187"></a>propagated into Chaldea gave occasion to the Æra of <a id="l188"></a>Nabonassar. For the years of Nabonassar &amp; those of <a id="l189"></a>Egypt began on one &amp; the same day (the first day of the first month called by them Thoth), &amp; were in all <a id="l190"></a>respects the same. And the first year of Nabonassar <a id="l191"></a>began on the 26<sup>th</sup> day of February seven hundred <a id="l192"></a>forty &amp; seven years before the vulgar Æra, &amp; thirty &amp; <a id="l193"></a>three days &amp; five hours before the Vernal Æquinox <a id="l194"></a>according to the Suns mean motion. For it is not likely <a id="l195"></a>that the Equation of the Suns motion should be known <a id="l196"></a>in the infancy of Astronomy. Now recconing that the <a id="l197"></a>year of 365 days, wants five hours &amp; 49 minutes <a id="l198"></a>of the Equinoctial year; the beginning of this year <a id="l199"></a>will move backwards 33 days &amp; five hours in 137 <a id="l200"></a>years; &amp; by consequence this year began at first in Egypt <a id="l201"></a>upon the Vernal Equinox according to the Suns mean <a id="l202"></a>motion 137 years before the Æra of Nabonassar began, <a id="l203"></a>that is in the year of the Iulian Period 3830, or 96 years <a id="l204"></a>after the death of Solomon. For then ended the reign of Amenophis. And if it began upon the <a id="l205"></a>day next after the Vernal Equinox, it might begin <a id="l206"></a>four years earlier. This year the Persian Empire re<a id="l207"></a>ceived from the Babylonian, &amp; the Greeks also used it <a id="l208"></a>in the Æra Philippœa dated from the death of Alexander, <a id="l209"></a>&amp; Iulius Cæsar corrected it  by adding a day in <a id="l210"></a>every four years, &amp; made it the year of the Romans.</p>
<p id="par8">The first month of the Lunisolar year began <a id="l211"></a>sometimes a week or fortnight before the Vernal Equinox. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> &amp; sometimes as much after it. And this year gave occasion <a id="l212"></a>to the first Astronomers who formed the Asterisms, to place <a id="l213"></a>the Equinoxes &amp; Solstices in the middle of the Constellations of <a id="l214"></a>Aries, Cancer, Chelæ &amp; Capricorn. Achilles<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> Tatius tells us that <a id="l215"></a>some anciently placed the solstice in the beginning of Cancer <a id="l216"></a>others  in the eighth degree of Cancer, others about the twelfth <a id="l217"></a>degree &amp; others about the fifteenth degree. This variety of opi<a id="l218"></a>nions proceeded from the Precession of the Equinox then not <a id="l219"></a>known to the Greeks. When the sphere was first formed <a id="l220"></a>the  solstice was in the 15<sup>th</sup> degree or middle of the Con<a id="l221"></a>stellation of Cancer. Then it came into the twelth, 8<sup>th</sup> 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; 1<sup>st</sup> <a id="l222"></a>degree successively. Eudoxus (who was contemporary to Meton) in describing the sphere of the <a id="l223"></a>ancients placed the Solstices &amp; Equinoxes in the middle of <a id="l224"></a>the Constellations of Aries  Cancer Chelæ &amp; Capri<a id="l225"></a>corn, as is affirmed by Hipparchus Bithynus &amp; appears also <a id="l226"></a>by the description of the Equinoctial &amp; Tropical circles in <a id="l227"></a>Aratus who copied after Eudoxus, &amp; by the positions of the <a id="l228"></a>Colures of the Equinoxes &amp; Solstices which in the sphere of <a id="l229"></a>Eudoxus  described by Hipparchus, went through the mid<a id="l230"></a>dle of those Constellations. For Hipparchus tells us that <a id="l231"></a>Eudoxus drew the Colure of the Solstices through the middle <a id="l232"></a>of the great Bear &amp; the middle of Cancer &amp; the neck of <a id="l233"></a>Hydrus &amp; the star between the Poop &amp; Mast of Argo, &amp; the <a id="l234"></a>Tayle of the South Fish, &amp; through the middle of Capricorn <a id="l235"></a>&amp; of Sagitta, &amp; through the neck &amp; right wing of the <a id="l236"></a>Swan &amp; the left hand of Cepheus. And that he drew the <a id="l237"></a>Equinoctial Colure through the left hand of Aretophylax <a id="l238"></a>&amp; along the middle of his body, &amp; cross the middle of Chelæ <a id="l239"></a>&amp; through the right hand &amp; foreknee of the Centaur, &amp; <a id="l240"></a>through the flexure of Eridanus &amp; head of Cetus &amp; the <a id="l241"></a>back of Aries across, &amp; through the head &amp; right hand <a id="l242"></a>of Perseus.</p>
<p id="par9">Now Chiron delineated σχήματα ὀλύμπου the Aste<a id="l243"></a>risms, as the ancient author of Gigantomachia cited by <a id="l244"></a>Clemens<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> Alexandrinus, informs us.

<p id="par16">Moton &amp; Euctemon<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup> in order to publish the Lunar cycle of <a id="l405"></a>19 years, observed the summer solstice in the year of Nabonassar <a id="l406"></a>316: &amp; Columella<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup> tells us that they placed it in the eighth degree <a id="l409"></a>of Cancer: which is at least seven degrees backwards then at first.

And this is after the <a id="l425"></a>rate of an hundred years to a degree as was then stated by Hipparchus. But it really went <a id="l426"></a>back a  degree in seventy two years &amp; eleven degrees in 792 years.

In the end of the year 1689 the <a id="l460"></a>longitude of Arcturus was <span class="ns">♎</span> 19<sup>deg.</sup>. 53′ 52″. And therefore <a id="l461"></a>Arcturus had there moved 36 degrees &amp;  47 minutes form his <a id="l462"></a>first place: that is, the Equinox had gone so much backward <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> since the first formation of the Asterisms &amp; the Argonautic <a id="l463"></a>Expedition. This calculation agrees with the former within <a id="l464"></a> 18 minutes of a degree &amp; the difference will vanish by allowing a <a id="l465"></a>minute  of time between the observation of the setting <a id="l466"></a>sun whereby the eyes of the spectator would be dazzelled &amp; the <a id="l467"></a>observation of the rising star after the eyes were recovered.</p>
<p id="par19">From all these calculations grounded upon the coarse <a id="l468"></a>observations of the Ancients we may reccon it certain that the <a id="l469"></a>Argonautic Expedition was not earlier then the reign of <a id="l470"></a>Solomon, &amp; most probable that it was almost 40 or 45 years <a id="l471"></a>after his death.</p>
<p id="par20">The Trojan war was one generation later then that <a id="l472"></a>Expedition, several Captains of the Greeks in that war <a id="l473"></a>being sons of the Argonauts. And the ancient Greeks <a id="l474"></a>recconed Memnon or Amenophis king of Egypt to have <a id="l475"></a>reigned in the times of that war, feigning him to be the <a id="l476"></a>son of Tithonus the elder brother of Priam. Amenophis <a id="l477"></a>was therefore of the same age with the elder children of <a id="l478"></a>Priam. In the last year of the Trojan war he was with <a id="l479"></a>his army at Susa according to the opinion of the ancient <a id="l480"></a>Greeks; &amp; after that he might return into Egypt &amp; adorn <a id="l481"></a>it with Buildings Obelisks &amp; Statues &amp; dye there about <a id="l482"></a>90 or 95 years after the death of Solomon when he had determined &amp; setled the beginning of the new Egyptian <a id="l483"></a>year of 365 days upon the Vernal Equinox so as to <a id="l484"></a>deserve the monument above mentioned in memory thereof.</p>

<p id="par22">Thus by two arguments founded upon Astronomy the one <a id="l485"></a>taken from the Precession of the Equinox, the other from the Æra <a id="l486"></a>of the Theban year, it appears that the Argonautic Expedition <a id="l487"></a>was about 40 or  45 years later then the death of Solomon <a id="l488"></a>&amp; the Trojan war about 70 or 80 years later then his death, <a id="l489"></a>&amp; the death of Amenophis or Memnon the supposed son of Titho<a id="l490"></a>nus the brother of Priam, about 90 or 95 years later. And <a id="l491"></a>the truth of these things will be further confirmed when <a id="l492"></a>it shall appear that Sesostris was Sesac &amp; invaded the <a id="l493"></a>nations one generation before the Argonautic Expedition. <a id="l494"></a>Now these recconings differing from the Chronology of the <a id="l495"></a>Greeks, give us occasion to enquire into the reason of the difference.</p>
<p id="par23">The Europeans had no Chronology before the times of the Persian <a id="l496"></a>Monarchy. And what ever chronology they have of ancienter <a id="l497"></a>times has been framed since by reasoning &amp; conjecture in the beginning of that Monarchy  that Acusilaus  put 1020 years from the flood of <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Ogiges<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> to the beginning of the Olympiads <a id="l498"></a>which is above <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>640<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> years too much. And his followers have endeavoured to fill up this intervall. <a id="l499"></a>Plutarch tells<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup> us that the Philosophers anciently delivered their <a id="l501"></a>opinions in verse, as Orpheus, Hesiod, Parmenides, Xenopha<a id="l502"></a>nes, Empedocles, Thales but afterwards left off the use <a id="l503"></a>of verses, &amp; that Aristarchus, Timocharis, Aristillus, Hippar<a id="l504"></a>chus, did not make Astronomy the more contemptible by de<a id="l505"></a>scribing it in prose after Eudoxus Hesiod &amp; Thales had wrote <a id="l506"></a>of it in verse. Solon<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup>  wrote in verse, &amp; all the <a id="l507"></a>seven wise men were addicted to Poetry as Anaximenes<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> <a id="l509"></a>affirmed. Till those days the Greeks wrote only in verse <a id="l510"></a>&amp; while they did so there could be no Chronology, nor <a id="l511"></a>any other History then such as was mixed with Poetical <a id="l512"></a>fancies. Pliny<sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n36-ref">[36]</sup> in recconing up the inventors of things <a id="l514"></a>tells us that Pherecides Syrius taught to compose dis<a id="l515"></a>courses in prose in the reign of Cyrus, &amp; Cadmus Mile<a id="l516"></a>sius to write history. And in another place he<sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n37-ref">[37]</sup> saith <a id="l518"></a>that Cadmus Milesius  was the first that wrote in prose. Iosephus <a id="l519"></a>tells<sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup> us that Cadmus Milesius &amp; Acusilaus were but a <a id="l521"></a>little before the expedition of the Persians against the <a id="l522"></a>Greeks. And Suidas<sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n39-ref">[39]</sup> calls Acusilaus a most ancient histo<a id="l523"></a>rian &amp; saith that he wrote Genealogies out of tables of <a id="l524"></a>brass which his father, as was reported, found in a corner <a id="l525"></a>of his house. Who hid them  there may be doubted. <a id="l526"></a>For the greeks<sup>i</sup><sup class="note" id="n40-ref">[40]</sup> had no public table or inscription <a id="l528"></a>older than the laws of Draco made<sup>k</sup><sup class="note" id="n41-ref">[41]</sup> in the 39<sup>th</sup> Olym<a id="l529"></a>piad; according to Suidas, or rather in the 50<sup>th</sup> or 51<sup>th</sup> Pherecides Atheniensis in the reign of Darius <a id="l530"></a>Hipstaspis or soon after, wrote of the antiquities &amp; ancient <a id="l531"></a>genealogies of the Athenians in ten books &amp; was one of <a id="l532"></a>the first European writers of this kind, &amp; one of the <a id="l533"></a>best: whence he had the name of Genealogus, &amp; by <a id="l534"></a><sup>l</sup><sup class="note" id="n42-ref">[42]</sup>Dionysius Halicarnassensis is said to be second to none <a id="l536"></a>of the Genealogers. Epimenides, not the Philosopher <a id="l537"></a>but an Historian, wrote also of the ancient genealogies <a id="l538"></a>And Hellanicus who was twelve years older then Herodotus <a id="l539"></a>digested his history by the ages (or successions) of the Priestesses <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span> of Iuno Argiva. Others digested theirs by those of the Archons <a id="l540"></a>of Athens, or Kings of the Lacedemonians. Hippias the Elian pub<a id="l541"></a>lished a Breviary of the Olympiads supported by no certain arguments <a id="l542"></a>as Plutarch<sup>m</sup><sup class="note" id="n43-ref">[43]</sup> tells. He  lived in the 105<sup>th</sup> <a id="l543"></a>Olympiad &amp; was derided by Plato for his ignorance. This <a id="l544"></a>Breviary seems to have conteined nothing more than a short <a id="l545"></a>account of the Victors in every Olympiad. Then Ephonus<sup>n</sup><sup class="note" id="n44-ref">[44]</sup> the <a id="l548"></a>disciple of Isocrates formed a chronological history of Greece <a id="l549"></a>beginning with the return of the Heraclides into Peloponne<a id="l550"></a>sus &amp; ending with the siege of Perinthus in the 20<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l551"></a>Philip the father of Alexander the great that is eleven years before the fall of the Persian Empire. But he digested <a id="l552"></a>things <sup>o</sup><sup class="note" id="n45-ref">[45]</sup> by generations. And the recconing by the Olympiads <a id="l553"></a>was not yet in use. The Arundelian marbles were com<a id="l554"></a>posed sixty years after the death of Alexander the great <a id="l555"></a>(An. 4 Olymp 128) &amp; yet mention not the Olympiads: But <a id="l556"></a>Chronology was now reduced to a reconing by years.  And in the  next Olympiad Tiniæus Siculus improved it. For he wrote a history in <a id="l557"></a>several books down to his own times according to the Olympi<a id="l558"></a>ads, comparing the Ephori, the kings of Sparta, the Ar<a id="l559"></a>chons of Athens &amp; the Priestesses of  Argos <a id="l560"></a>with the Olympic victors, so as to make the Olympiads <a id="l561"></a>&amp; the Genealogies &amp; successions of Kings &amp; Priestesses &amp; <a id="l562"></a>the Poetical histories suit  with one another according <a id="l563"></a>to the best of his judgment; &amp; where he left off Polybius <a id="l564"></a>began &amp; carried on the history. Eratosthenes wrote above <a id="l565"></a>an hundred years after the death of Alexander the great. <a id="l566"></a>He was followed by Apollodorus, &amp; these two have been <a id="l567"></a>followed ever since by Chronologers. But how uncertain <a id="l568"></a>their chronology is, &amp; how doubtfull it was reputed by <a id="l569"></a>the  of those times, may be understood by these <a id="l570"></a>passages of Plutarch. <em class="underline">Some reccon Lycurgus,</em> saith<sup>p</sup><sup class="note" id="n46-ref">[46]</sup> he, <a id="l572"></a><em class="underline">contemporary to Iphitus, &amp; <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>so<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>to<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> have been his companion <a id="l573"></a>in ordering the Olympic festivals, amongst whom was <a id="l574"></a>Aristotel the Philosopher: arguing from the Olympic <a id="l575"></a>Disk which had the name of Lycurgus upon it. Others <a id="l576"></a>supputing the times by the succession of the Kings of La<a id="l577"></a>cedemon, as Eratosthenes &amp; Apollodorus, affirm that <a id="l578"></a>he was not a few years older then the first Olympiad.</em> <a id="l579"></a> He began to flourish in the eighteenth Olympiad but at length Aristotel &amp; some others made him as old as the <a id="l580"></a>first Olympiad, &amp; then Erastosthenes, Apollodorus &amp; their <a id="l581"></a>followers made him above an hundred years older. And <a id="l582"></a>in another place Plutarch<sup>q</sup><sup class="note" id="n47-ref">[47]</sup> tells us, <em class="underline">The congress of <a id="l584"></a>Solon with Crœsus some think they can confute by chro<a id="l585"></a>nology.

<p id="par24">And as for the chronology of the Latines, that <a id="l592"></a>is still more uncertain. Plutarch<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n48-ref">[48]</sup> represents great uncer<a id="l595"></a>tanties in the originals of Rome, &amp; so doth<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n49-ref">[49]</sup> Servius.

<p id="par25">Diodorus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n51-ref">[51]</sup> in the beginning of his history tells <a id="l602"></a>us that he did not define by any certain space the <a id="l603"></a>times preceding the Trojan war because he had no <a id="l604"></a>certain foundation to rely upon: but from the <a id="l605"></a>Trojan war according to the recconing of Apollodorus <a id="l606"></a>Atheniensis whom he followed there were eighty years <a id="l607"></a> to the return of the Heraclides into Peloponaasus; &amp; <a id="l608"></a>from that period to the first Olympiad there were <a id="l609"></a>three hundred &amp; twenty eight years, computing the times <a id="l610"></a>from the kings of the Lacedemonians. Apollodorus <a id="l611"></a>followed Erastothenes &amp; both of them followed Thu<a id="l612"></a>cydides &amp; perhaps he followed Aeusilaus in recconing eighty years from the Trojan war <a id="l613"></a>to the return of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus:  <a id="l614"></a>For they attempted to return about twenty years before the taking of Troy, but were then repulsed &amp; <a id="l615"></a>directed by the Oracle to return after three generations or an hundred years. But in recconing three hundred twenty &amp; eight years from <a id="l616"></a>that return to the first Olympiad, the Chronologers only com<a id="l617"></a>puted the times by the successions of the Kings of <a id="l618"></a>Lacedæmon, as Plutarch<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n52-ref">[52]</sup> also affirms; &amp; therein they <a id="l621"></a>have been ever since followed by later Chronologers. <a id="l622"></a>And since this recconing was gathered by computing <a id="l623"></a>the times from the Kings of the Lacedemonians, that <a id="l624"></a>is, from their number  let us reexamin that compu<a id="l625"></a>tation.</p>
<p id="par26">All nations before they began to keep exact accounts <a id="l626"></a>of time, have been prone to raise their antiquities, &amp; <a id="l627"></a>this humour has been promoted by the contention – <a id="l628"></a>between nations about the antiquity of their ori<a id="l629"></a>ginals. The Greeks &amp; Latines have been more modest <a id="l630"></a>in this point then the Egyptians &amp; Persians &amp; some other nations <a id="l631"></a>but yet have exceeded the truth.

For they make the <a id="l637"></a>seven kings of Rome who proceeded the Consuls to have reigned <a id="l638"></a>244 years which is one with another 35 years a piece.

Let the recconing be re<a id="l704"></a>duced to the course of nature by putting the reigns of kings <a id="l705"></a>one with another at about 18 or 20 years a piece: &amp; the <a id="l706"></a>ten kings of Sparta by one race, the nine by another race, <a id="l707"></a>the ten kings of Messene &amp; the nine of Arcadia above <a id="l708"></a>mentioned between the return of the Heraclides into <a id="l709"></a>Peloponnesus &amp; the end of the first Messenian war, <a id="l710"></a>will scarce take up above 180 or 200 years.</p>
<p id="par28">Euryleon the son of Ægeus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> commanded the main body <a id="l714"></a>of the Messenians in the  fift year of the first <a id="l715"></a>Messenian war, &amp; was in the fift generation from Oio<a id="l716"></a>lycus the son of Theras the brother in law of Aristodemus <a id="l717"></a>&amp; Tutor his sons Eurysthenes &amp; Procles, as Pausanian <a id="l718"></a>relates. And by consequence, from the return of the <a id="l719"></a>Heraclides, which was in the days of Theras, to the <a id="l720"></a>battel in the fift year of this war there were six <a id="l721"></a>generations; which (as I conceive) being for the most <a id="l722"></a>part by the eldest sons, will scarce exceed 30 years to <a id="l723"></a>a generations, &amp; so may amount to about 175 or 180 <a id="l724"></a>years. That war lasted 19 or 20 years. Add the last 15 <a id="l725"></a>years &amp; there will be about 190 or 195 years to the <a id="l726"></a>end of that war: whereas the followers of  Timæus <a id="l727"></a>make it about 380 years.</p>
<p id="par29">In the race of the Spartan kings descended from <a id="l728"></a>Eurysthenes, after Polydorus reigned these kings Eurycrates I, <a id="l729"></a>Alexander, Eurycrates II, Leon, Anaxandrides, Cleomenses, <a id="l730"></a>Leonidas, &amp;c, &amp; in the other race, after Theopompus, reigned <a id="l731"></a>Zeuxidamus, Anaxidamus, Archidamus, Agasicles, Ariston, <a id="l732"></a>Demaratus, Leotycides &amp;c  according to Pausanias, or <a id="l733"></a>Anaxandridas, Archidemus, Anaxileus, Leutychildes, Hippo<a id="l734"></a>cratides, Ariston, Demaratus, Leutychides II according to Hero<a id="l735"></a>dotus. Leonidas was slain at Thermopylæ in the sixt <a id="l736"></a>year of Xerxes, &amp; Leutychides was then alive, so that <a id="l737"></a>in one race there were seven kings between the end of <a id="l738"></a>the first Messenian war &amp; the sixt year of Xerxes &amp; <a id="l739"></a>in the other race there were between six &amp; seven kings <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015r"> &lt;15r&gt; </span> according to Pausanias or between seven &amp; eight ac<a id="l740"></a>cording to Herodotus, or at a medium, seven kings in <a id="l741"></a>both races.

Anaxandrides &amp; Ariston the last <a id="l745"></a>of those seven kings of Sparta but two, were<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n54-ref">[54]</sup> contem<a id="l746"></a>porary to Cræsus.  And <a id="l751"></a>Cræsus began his reign about 28 years before the death of <a id="l752"></a>Cyrus. Count backwards eighty years more for the four – <a id="l753"></a>preceding reigns of the kings of Sparta unto the end of <a id="l754"></a>the first Messenian war, &amp; 190 years more  unto the <a id="l755"></a>return of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus: &amp; this return <a id="l756"></a>will be about 298 years before the death of Cyrus. Subduct <a id="l757"></a>the years of the Olympiads &amp; there will remain about <a id="l758"></a>51 years between the return of the Heraclides &amp; the first <a id="l759"></a>Olympiad. But the followers of Ephorus place the <a id="l760"></a>return of the Heraclides about 275 years earlier; <a id="l761"></a>&amp; this is the fundamental error of the artificial chro<a id="l762"></a>nology of the Greeks.</p>
<p id="par30">The kingdom of Macedon<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n55-ref">[55]</sup> was founded by Caranus &amp; <a id="l763"></a>Perdiccas, who being of the race of Temenus king of <a id="l764"></a>Argos, fled from Argos in the reign of Phidon the brother <a id="l765"></a>of Caranus. Temenus entered Peloponnesus with the Heraclides <a id="l766"></a>as above. And after him &amp; his son Cisus the kingdom of Argos <a id="l767"></a>became divided among the posterity of Temenus untill <a id="l768"></a>Phidon reunited it expelling his own kindred. He grew potent, <a id="l769"></a>appointed weights &amp; measures in Peloponnesus, &amp; coyned Silver <a id="l770"></a>moneys, &amp; removing the Pisæans &amp; Eleans, presided in the <a id="l771"></a>Olympic games, but was soon after subdued by the Eleans <a id="l772"></a>&amp; Spartans. Herodotus<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n56-ref">[56]</sup> reccons that Perdiccas was the first king of Ma<a id="l773"></a>cedon. Later writers, as Livy, Pausanias &amp; Suidas make Cara<a id="l774"></a>nus the first King. Iustin calls Perdiccas the successor <a id="l775"></a>of Caranus, &amp; Solinus saith that Perdiccas succeeded <a id="l776"></a>Caranus, &amp; was the first that obteined the name of <a id="l777"></a>King. Its probably that Caranus &amp; Perdiccas were con<a id="l778"></a>temporaries &amp; fled at the same time from Phidon, &amp; <a id="l779"></a>at first erected small Principalities which after the death <a id="l780"></a>of Caranus became one under Perdiccas. Herodotus<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n57-ref">[57]</sup> tells <a id="l781"></a>us that after Perdiccas reigned Aræus (or Argæus) Philip, <a id="l782"></a>Aeropus, Alcetus, Amyntas &amp; Alexander successively. <a id="l783"></a>Alexander was contemporary to Xerxes king of Persia <a id="l784"></a>&amp; died An. 4 Olymp. 79 &amp; was succeeded by Perdiccas II. And <a id="l785"></a> Thucȳdides<sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n58-ref">[58]</sup> tells us that there were eight kings of Macedon <a id="l787"></a>before Archelaus the son of Perdiccas. Now by recconing <a id="l788"></a>above 40 years a piece to these kings, Chronologers have <a id="l789"></a>made Caranus older then the Olympiads: where as if we <a id="l790"></a>should reccon their reigns at about 18 or 20 years <a id="l791"></a>a piece, the first seven reigns counted backwards from <a id="l792"></a>the death of Alexander, will place the beginning of the <a id="l793"></a>kingdom of Macedon under Perdiccas &amp; Caranus upon the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span> 46<sup>th</sup> Olympiad or thereabouts.

<p id="par43">Rehoboam was born in the last year of King David, being <a id="l1154"></a>41 years old at the death of Solomon (1 King. 14. 41) &amp; therefore his <a id="l1155"></a>father Solomon was born in the 18<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign or before. <a id="l1156"></a>And two or three years before his  birth David besieged Rabbah <a id="l1157"></a>the Metropolis of the Ammonites &amp; committed adultery with Bathsheba. <a id="l1158"></a>And the yeare before this siege began David vanquished the Ammonity <a id="l1159"></a>&amp; their confederates the Syrians of Zobah &amp; Rehok &amp; Ishlob &amp; Moacah <a id="l1160"></a>&amp; Damascus extending his dominion over all those nations as far as <a id="l1161"></a>to the entring in of Hamath &amp; the river Euphrates.

If these feigned kings be rejected <a id="l1647"></a>Ægialeus will become contemporary to his brother Phoroneus.</p>
<p id="par67">The three first kings of Argos were Inochus Phoroneus &amp; Argoss <a id="l1648"></a>the grandson of Phoroneus. For the Ancients tell us that Niobe the <a id="l1649"></a>daughter of Phoroneus was the first woman with whom Iupiter <a id="l1650"></a>lay &amp; that after he begot Argus. So then Argus was one genera<a id="l1651"></a>tion younger ten Apis the brother of Niobe &amp; two generations younger <a id="l1652"></a>then Phoroneus &amp; by consequence flourished in the reign of So<a id="l1653"></a>lomon.

For Callithyia the daughter of <a id="l1658"></a>Peranthus was Priestess of Apollo at Delphos in &amp;  Phoci in a Temple built there <a id="l1659"></a>by her father Peranthus to this god,  &amp; gave  the first answers of the Oracle to Acrisius the son of Abas. &amp; therefore <a id="l1660"></a>Abas was contemporary to the brothers Peranthus &amp; Phorbas. Abas <a id="l1661"></a>was also contemporary to Lacidæmon &amp; Sparta for his son Acrisius <a id="l1662"></a>married their daughter Eurydice.  Phorbas might be <a id="l1665"></a>succeeded in Rhodes by his son Triopas for Agenor the son of Tripas invaded <a id="l1666"></a>Argos with a great multitude of horse, &amp; married his daughter Messene to  Polycaon as above &amp; was succeeded either in Rhodes <a id="l1667"></a>or some part of Argos by his son Crotopus.

    <p id="par71">The two first kings of Crete contemporary to the Curetes were Asterius &amp; <a id="l1788"></a>Minos, &amp; Europa was the Queen of Asterius &amp; mother of Minos, &amp; the Idœan <a id="l1789"></a>Curetes were her country men &amp; came with her &amp; her brother Atymnus into Crete, <a id="l1790"></a>&amp; dwelt in the Idœan cave in her reign, &amp; there educated Iupiter &amp; found out <a id="l1791"></a>iron &amp; made armour. And therefore these three Asterius Europa &amp; Minos <a id="l1792"></a>must be the Saturn Rhea &amp; Iupiter of the Cretans. Minos is usually called <a id="l1793"></a>the son of Iupiter, but his is with relation to the fable that Iupiter in the <a id="l1794"></a>shape of a bull carried away Europa from Sidon. For the Phenicians upon their <a id="l1795"></a>first coming into Greece gave the name of (<em class="underline">Iao-pater</em>) Iupiter to every king, &amp; so <a id="l1796"></a>Minos was a Iupiter of the Greeks. According to Echemenes an ancient <a id="l1797"></a>author cited by <em class="underline">Athenæus</em>, he was that Iupiter who committed the rape upon <sup class="note" id="n137-ref">[137]</sup> <a id="l1799"></a>Ganimede, the others say it was Tantalus. He was that Iupiter who was <a id="l1800"></a>most famous among the Greeks for justice &amp; dominion, being the greatest King in <a id="l1801"></a>all Greece in those days. <em class="underline">Lucian</em> let us know that his mother Europa was <sup class="note" id="n138-ref">[138]</sup> <a id="l1803"></a>worshipped by the name of Rhea in the form of a woman sitting in a chariot <a id="l1804"></a>drawn by Lions with a drumm in her hand &amp; a <em class="underline">corona turrita</em> on her head like <a id="l1805"></a>Astarte &amp; Isis. And the Cretans anciently shewed the house where this Rhea <sup class="note" id="n139-ref">[139]</sup> <a id="l1806"></a>lived. And Apollonius Rhodius tells us that Saturn, while he reigned over the <sup class="note" id="n140-ref">[140]</sup> <a id="l1808"></a>Titans in Olympus [a mountain of Crete] &amp; Iupiter was educated by the Curetes <a id="l1809"></a>in the Cretan cave, deceived Rhea &amp; of Philyra begot Chiron. And therefore <a id="l1810"></a>the Cretan Saturn &amp; Rhea were but one generation older then Chiron, &amp; by <a id="l1811"></a>consequence not older then Asterius &amp; Europe the parents of Minos. For Chiron <a id="l1812"></a>lived till after the Argonautic Expedition, &amp; had two grandsons in that expedition, <a id="l1813"></a>&amp; Europa came into Crete above an hundred years before that expedition. Lucian <sup class="note" id="n141-ref">[141]</sup> <a id="l1815"></a>tells us that the Cretans did not only relate that Iupiter was born and buried <a id="l1816"></a>among them, but also shewed his sepulchre. And Porphyry that Pythagoras went down <sup class="note" id="n142-ref">[142]</sup> <a id="l1818"></a>into the Idœan Cave to see his sepulchre. And Cicero in numbering three Iupiters, said that<sup class="note" id="n143-ref">[143]</sup> <a id="l1820"></a>the third was the Creton Iupiter Saturn's son whose sepulchre was shewn in Crete. <a id="l1821"></a>And the Scholiast upon Callimachus lets us know that his was the sepulchre of <a id="l1822"></a>Minos. his words are. <sup class="note" id="n144-ref">[144]</sup>Ε᾽ν Κρήτη ἐπὶ τῶ τάφῳ τοῦ Μίνωος ἐπιγέγραπτο ΜΙ<a id="l1824"></a>ΝΩΟΣ ΤΟΥ ΔΙΟΣ ΤΑΦΟΣ. τῷ χρόνῳ δὲ τὸ τοῦ Μίνωος ἀπηλέιφθη ὤστε <a id="l1825"></a>περιλειφθῆναι Διὸς τάφος. ἐκ τούτου οῦν ἔχειν λέγουσιν Κρῆτες τὸν <a id="l1826"></a>τάφον τοῦ Διός. <a id="l1827"></a>By Saturn Cicero who was a Latin understood the Saturn <a id="l1828"></a>so called by the Latines.

<p id="par75">By all this it may be understood that as the Egyptians <a id="l2003"></a>who deified their  kings, began their kingdom with the reign of <a id="l2004"></a>their Gods &amp; Heroes, recconing Menses the first man who <a id="l2005"></a>reigned after their Gods: so the Greeks had the ages of their <a id="l2006"></a>Gods &amp; Heroes, calling them the golden silver brazen &amp; iron <a id="l2007"></a>ages.

These four ages immediately succeeded the flood <a id="l2075"></a>of Deucalion, &amp; therefore that flood was about the 16<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l2076"></a>of King David.

<p id="par76">Before the Phenicians introduced the deifying of dead <a id="l2083"></a>men, the Greeks had a Court of Elders in every Town for the <a id="l2084"></a>government thereof, &amp; a  place where the Elders &amp; people <a id="l2085"></a>worshipped their God with sacrifices. And when many of these <a id="l2086"></a>towns for their common safety united under a common Council <a id="l2087"></a>they erected a  Prytaneum in one of the towns  where the Council &amp; people met at certain times <a id="l2089"></a>to consult of their common safety &amp; worship their common <a id="l2090"></a>God with sacrifices &amp; to buy &amp; sell.

The Prytanea <a id="l2101"></a>were Courts with places of worship so named perhaps from the perpetual fire <a id="l2102"></a>kept therein for sacrificing. From the word Ἑστὶα fire came <a id="l2103"></a>the name Vesta which at length the people turned into a <a id="l2104"></a>Goddess, &amp; so became fire worshippers like the ancient <a id="l2105"></a>Persians.

So the Argives composed Mantinea in <a id="l2143"></a>Arcadia out of five towns, &amp; Tegea out of nine. And <a id="l2144"></a>out of so many was Herœa built by Cleombrotus or by <a id="l2145"></a>Cleonymus. So also Ægium was built out of seven or eight <a id="l2146"></a>towns, Patræ out of seven, Dyne out of eight; &amp; so Elis <a id="l2147"></a>was erected by the conflux of many towns into one <a id="l2148"></a>city.</em></p>
<p id="par79">And Pausanias<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n168-ref">[168]</sup> tells us that the Arcadians accounted <a id="l2150"></a>Pelasgus  the first man &amp; that he was their first king &amp; <a id="l2151"></a>taught the ignorant people to build houses for defending <a id="l2152"></a>themselves from heat &amp; cold &amp; rain &amp; to make them <a id="l2153"></a>garments of skins, &amp; instead of hearbs &amp; roots which <a id="l2154"></a>were sometimes noxious, to eat the acorns of the Beach <a id="l2155"></a>tree; &amp; that his son Lycaon build the oldest city in <a id="l2156"></a>all Greece. He tells us also that in the days of Lelex the  Spartans lived in villages apart.

<p id="par83">So also in Sicily the Sicanians who were the first <a id="l2216"></a>memorable inhabitants of that Island, <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n175-ref">[175]</sup> built little villages or towns <a id="l2218"></a>upon the hills, &amp; every town had its own king.

<p id="par84"> And Herodotus tells us that all Media <sup class="note" id="n177-ref">[177]</sup> <a id="l2231"></a>was peopled by δήμοι, towns without walls, till they <a id="l2232"></a>revolted from the Assyrians, which was about 267 years <a id="l2233"></a>after the death of Solomon; &amp; that after that revolt they <a id="l2234"></a>set up a king over them, &amp; built Ecbatane with walls for <a id="l2235"></a>his seat, the first town which they walled about. And Benhadad king of Syria had 32 kings in his army against Ahab I King 20. 16.

For the Patriarchs wandered there in <a id="l2241"></a>tents &amp; fed their flocks wherever they pleased, the fields <a id="l2242"></a>of Phenicia not being yet fully appropriated for want of people. <a id="l2243"></a>The countries first inhabited by mankind were in those days <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p036r"> &lt;36r&gt; </span> so thinly peopled that four kings from the coasts of <a id="l2244"></a>Shinar &amp; Elam invaded &amp; spoiled the Rephaims &amp; the <a id="l2245"></a>inhabitants of the countries of Moab, Ammon, Edom, <a id="l2246"></a>&amp; the kingdoms of Sodom Gomorrah Admah &amp; Zeboim <a id="l2247"></a>&amp; yet were pursued &amp; beaten by Abraham with an <a id="l2248"></a>armed force of only 318 men, the whole force which <a id="l2249"></a>Abraham &amp; the Princes with him could raise.

<p id="par85">When navigation was so far improved that the <a id="l2264"></a>Phenicians began to leave the sea shore &amp; sail through <a id="l2265"></a>the Mediterranean by the help of the starrs, it may be <a id="l2266"></a>presumed that they began to discover the Islands of the <a id="l2267"></a>Mediterranean, &amp; for the sake of trafic to sail as <a id="l2268"></a>far as Greece: &amp; this was not long before they carried <a id="l2269"></a>away Io the daughter of Inachus from Argos.  The Cares first infested the Greek seas with pyracy. And then Minos the <a id="l2271"></a>son of Europa got up a potent fleet &amp; sent out Colonies.

<p id="par91">And the island Cyprus was discovered by the Pheni<a id="l2410"></a>cians not long before.

<p id="par92">All these footsteps there are of the first peopling <a id="l2426"></a>of  Europe &amp; its islands.

Gen 9. 6 &amp; Levit. 17. 12, 13. This law <a id="l2461"></a>was ancienter then the days of Moses being given to Noah <a id="l2462"></a>&amp; his sons long before the days of Abraham, &amp; therefore when the Apostles &amp; Elders in <a id="l2463"></a>the Council at Ierusalem declared that the Gentiles were <a id="l2464"></a>not obliged to be circumcised &amp; observe the law of <a id="l2465"></a>Moses, they excepted this law of absteining from blood &amp; things strangled as being an earlier law of <a id="l2466"></a>God imposed not on the sons of Abraham only, but on the strangers within the gates of Israel, on all the <a id="l2467"></a>sons of Noah, a law imposed originalls not on Iews or Christians but even on Gentiles <a id="l2468"></a>a law  imposed on all nations while they lived together  in shinar <a id="l2469"></a>under the dominion of Noah &amp; his sons. And of the same <a id="l2470"></a>kind is the law of absteining from meats offered to idols <a id="l2471"></a>or fals Gods, &amp; from fornication. So then the religion of belei<a id="l2472"></a>ving that the world was  formed by one supreme God, &amp; is <a id="l2473"></a>governed by him, &amp; of loving &amp; worshipping him &amp;  loving our <a id="l2474"></a>neighbour as ourselves &amp; being mercifull even to bruit <a id="l2475"></a>Beasts is the oldest of all religions. And the original of Letters agriculture navigation musick <a id="l2476"></a> art, &amp; sciences metalls smiths &amp; carpenters towns &amp; houses in Europe, was not older then <a id="l2477"></a>the days of Eli Samuel &amp; David. And before those days the <a id="l2478"></a>Earth was so thinly peopled &amp; so overgrown with woods, that <a id="l2479"></a>mankind could not be older then is represented in scripture</p>
