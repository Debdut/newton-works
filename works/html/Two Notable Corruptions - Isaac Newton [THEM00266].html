<p id="par1">Concerning the Latin MSS  now extant these things <a id="l1"></a>are to be observed.  1  That the vulgar Latin  now  in use is not the  Vulgar Latin but Ierome's Version &amp;   therefore his Prefaces <a id="l3"></a>– where they  are extant  are usually found in the MSS prefaced to the sacred books: that also, to the canonical Epistles is extant in one of <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span>  so that the authority of the present vulgar Latin for justifying the testimony of the three in heaven <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>resolves<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> it self into Ieroms' authority.  2  That <a id="l4"></a>this Version was not an entirely new one, but a new edition of the old vulgar <a id="l5"></a>Latin with various corrections made by Ierome &amp; therefore tis not to <a id="l6"></a>be wondred if the testimony of the three in heaven hath amongst <a id="l7"></a>the rest of his corrections crept into the text.  3  That  the <a id="l8"></a>MSS which are not above 400 or 500 years old usually have this <a id="l9"></a>testimony, but those which are older usually want it &amp; therefore <a id="l10"></a>it has crept in by degrees, &amp; was not generally received by the <a id="l11"></a>Latins till  the disputing age of the schoolmen  blew it about.  4  That <a id="l12"></a>  it is wanting not only in those old MSS which  want  that Preface but also in the greatest part of those old ones which have <a id="l14"></a>it: &amp; therefore the first ages which received Ieromes edition with his <a id="l15"></a>Prefaces  were averse from receiving the  testimony of the <a id="l16"></a>three in heaven in the text  till the said Preface to the Canonical Epist. (which is <a id="l17"></a>found in almost all the old   &amp; therefore was first received) began to give it credit.  5  <a id="l18"></a>That this testimony of the 3 in h. in some of those old MSS. which have it not in <a id="l19"></a>the text is found noted in the margin in another hand &amp; therefore <a id="l20"></a>it crept first into the margins of the books by the authority of the <a id="l21"></a>said Preface, &amp; then in transcribing the books <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> the margins into the text. ✝
</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p0117v"> &lt;117v&gt; </span>
<p id="par2" class="i0">Tis agreed that the Latines, after Ieromes  Edition began to be <a id="l42"></a>received noted out of it his corrections of the Vulgar Latin in <a id="l43"></a>the margins of their books &amp; these the transcribers afterwars <a id="l44"></a>inserted into the text.  By this means the old Latin has <a id="l45"></a>been so generally corrected that it is no where to be found <a id="l46"></a>sincere.  Tis Ierome that we now read &amp; not the old vulgar <a id="l47"></a>Latin &amp; what wonder if in Ierome we read the testimony of <a id="l48"></a>the three in heaven?  For who that inserted the rest of Ie<a id="l49"></a>rome into the text would easily leave out such a passage for <a id="l50"></a>the Trinity as this is now taken to be?  And yet as the Latines <a id="l51"></a>of Ieromes age received it not but taxed him with  falsification <a id="l52"></a>of the scriptures for inserting it so those of the next ages were <a id="l53"></a>so averse to it that it was a long time before it crept into any <a id="l54"></a>competent number of their books &amp;  may be recconed one <a id="l55"></a>of the last of his corrections which they received.  Yet  <a id="l56"></a>at length by the authority of his Preface it crept by degrees into the margins of their books as the rest <a id="l57"></a>of his corrections had done before &amp; thence into the text where <a id="l58"></a>we now find it.  Yet I can scarce think with F. Simon that it <a id="l59"></a>had no other original  but from that Preface.  ffor the words <a id="l60"></a><em class="underline">in cælo</em> &amp; <em class="underline">in terra</em> are not in the Preface &amp; therefore were not <a id="l61"></a>borrowed from thence but from Ieromes correction of the text <a id="l62"></a>or at least  corrections which some ffalsary had made in one or more books to put about this  reading.  Lastly it is to be observed that the reading of this text in ancient <a id="l63"></a>MSS is very various and uncertain.  For this is a most infallible <a id="l64"></a>signe that the text has been tampered with &amp; that those who first <a id="l65"></a>inserted this testimony knew of no certain authentick reading which <a id="l66"></a>they were to follow, but   noted it  in the margins of their books in such various <a id="l67"></a>forms of words as they thought conformable either to Ieromes correction <a id="l68"></a>of the text or to his Preface or to such marginal notes as they had <a id="l69"></a>seen in other books  &amp; that sometimes without designing to make it part of the text  <a id="l70"></a> &amp; then the transcribers by these marginal notes corrected  <a id="l71"></a>the text some one way some another according to the best of <a id="l72"></a>their judgments.  For as this testimony in some old MSS  which <a id="l73"></a> want  it in the text, is  found <a id="l74"></a>noted in the margin in another  hand  so  in others  <a id="l75"></a> the various readings in the text are such as ought to result by transcribing <a id="l76"></a>it out of the margins   I shall only mention the three <a id="l77"></a>or four following varieties.  1  Of the MSS which have not the testimony – – – – <a id="l78"></a>– – – –  3<sup>dly</sup>  The testimony of the three in heaven in  some of the <a id="l79"></a>old MSS which have it, was set  before that of the three in earth,  as we now read it,  but in the far greatest part of them it was set after.  <a id="l81"></a> Which seems to have proceeded from <a id="l82"></a>hence that it was sometimes so noted in the margin that the reader <a id="l83"></a>or transcriber knew not whether it were to come before or <a id="l84"></a>after &amp; that in Ieromes Preface it was set after.  ffor this Preface <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p118r"> &lt;118r&gt; </span> <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>being<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> in most of their books  was always ready at hand to be consulted <a id="l85"></a> by all those who wrote it either in the <a id="l86"></a>margin or in the text, &amp; therefore would be apt to make them <a id="l87"></a>set it after.</p>
<p id="par3">Now that the MSS are such as we have here described will appear <a id="l88"></a>by the account which learned men have given of those they have con<a id="l89"></a>sulted.  Erasmus in describing  seven old ones besides that followed in the Badian Edition tels us that this testi<a id="l90"></a>mony was wanting in  five &amp; in the Badian &amp;  set after the spirit water &amp; <a id="l91"></a>blood in the other two &amp; that in one of the five it was noted in the <a id="l92"></a>margin in a newer hand.  His words are: In codice qui mihi suppedi<a id="l93"></a>tatus  est e Bibliotheca Minoritarum Antuerpiensium in margi<a id="l94"></a>ne scholium erat ascriptum de testimonio patris verbi et spiritus <a id="l95"></a>sed manu recentiore ut consentaneum sit hoc adjectum ab erudito <a id="l96"></a>quopiam qui noluerit hanc particulam prætermitti, quandoquidem <a id="l97"></a>nec in æditione Badiana ulla sit mentio patris filij et spiritus sancti <a id="l98"></a>– Duos consului codices miræ vetustatis Latinos in Bibliotheca <a id="l99"></a>quæ Brugis est  <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>bimi<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Donatiani.  Neuter habebat testimonium patris <a id="l100"></a>verbi et spiritus.  Ac ne illud quidem in altero addebatur, In terra.  <a id="l101"></a>Tantum erat, Et tres sunt qui testimonium dant spiritus aqua et <a id="l102"></a>sanguis.  In exemplari Constantiensi utroque post testimonium aquæ <a id="l103"></a>sanguinis et spiritus adjectum erat testimonum patris verbi et <a id="l104"></a>spiritus, his verbis, sicut in cælo tres sunt pater verbum et <a id="l105"></a>spiritus et tres unum sunt.  Nec erat additum testimonium dant <a id="l106"></a>nec pronomen hi.  In codice quem exhibuit publica bibliotheca <a id="l107"></a>Scholæ Basiliensis non erat testimonium spiritus aquæ et sangui<a id="l108"></a>nis.   Adhæc Paulus Bombasius vir doctus et integer meo rogatu <a id="l109"></a>locum hunc ad verbum descripsit ex Bibliothecæ Vaticanæ codice <a id="l110"></a>pervetusto in quo non habebatur, testimonium patris verbi et <a id="l111"></a>spiritus.  Si movet authoritas vetustatis, liber erat antiquissimus, <a id="l112"></a>si Pontificis ex illius bibliotheca petitum est testimonium.   Thus far <a id="l113"></a>Erasmus in h. l.   Peter Cholinus notes in the margin of his <a id="l114"></a> latin edition of the scriptures printed A.C. 1543 &amp; 1544 that it <a id="l115"></a>was wanting in the most ancient MS of the Tigurine  library  <a id="l116"></a>Hessalius in his commentary on the first Epistle of Iohn tells us <a id="l117"></a>that the MS of S<sup>t</sup> Peters Church in Lovane sets the testimony in <a id="l118"></a>heaven after that in earth reading the text thus Tres sunt qui <a id="l119"></a>testimonium dant in terra spiritus aqua et sanguis et tres sunt <a id="l120"></a>qui testimonium dant in cælo pater verbum et spiritus et tres <a id="l121"></a>unum sunt.  And this reading he preferrs.   D<sup>r</sup> Gilbert Bur<a id="l122"></a>net  in the first letter of his travelles  tells us that Ieromes Preface to the Canonical Epistles was in all the MSS ancient &amp; modern of those Bibles  that he ever saw <a id="l124"></a>&amp; gives us an account how  in consulting eight very ancient <a id="l125"></a>MSS he found  it in all of them but one &amp;  the testimony of the three in heaven was wanting in five <a id="l126"></a>of these eight MSS &amp; set after that of the  spirit water &amp; blood in the other three &amp; in <a id="l127"></a>two of the five he found it noted in the margin in another hand.  One <a id="l128"></a>of these was at Zurich &amp; seemed to him to be about 800 years old because <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p118v"> &lt;118v&gt; </span> written in a hand which began to be  used in Charles the great's <a id="l129"></a>time.  Another was at Basil of the same antiquity &amp; in both these <a id="l130"></a>Ieromes Preface was extant but the testimony of father word <a id="l131"></a>&amp; holy spirit was wanting.   At Strasburg he saw 4 very <a id="l132"></a>ancient MSS of the new Testament in latin.  Three of these seemed <a id="l133"></a>to be about the time of Charles the great &amp; so above 800 years old but the 4<sup>th</sup> seemed to be <a id="l134"></a>much ancienter &amp; might belong to the seventh century.  In it neither <a id="l135"></a>the Prologue nor the place was extant but it was added at the foot <a id="l136"></a>of the page in another hand.  In two of the other the Prologue is <a id="l137"></a>extant but the place is not: only in one of them it is added in <a id="l138"></a>the margin.  In the fourth as the  Prologue is extant so is the <a id="l139"></a>place, but it comes after the verse of the other three &amp; is joyned <a id="l140"></a>to it thus <em class="underline">sicut tres sunt in cælo</em>.  In the old MS Bible of Geneva <a id="l141"></a> which seemed to be above 700 years old &amp; also in  a <a id="l142"></a>MS latin Bible in the Library of S<sup>t</sup> Laurence of fflorence both <a id="l143"></a>S<sup>t</sup> Ieromes Preface &amp; the passage are extant, but  this passage comes <a id="l144"></a>after that  of the  other three  contrary to the <a id="l145"></a>received reading &amp; in that of fflorence is pinned to it with a <em class="underline">sicut</em> <a id="l146"></a> as in that at Strasburg, but <em class="underline">sicut</em> is not in the Geneva MS.  These <a id="l147"></a>are the 8 old MSS consulted by D<sup>r</sup> Burnet besides a 9<sup>th</sup>  which he saw  <a id="l148"></a>in S<sup>t</sup> Marks library in Venice in three languages Greek Latin &amp; <a id="l149"></a>Arabick that seemed not above 400 years old in which this passage <a id="l150"></a>was not in the Greek, but it was in the Latin set after that of the other <a id="l151"></a>three with a <em class="underline">sicut</em>.  </p>
<p id="par4"> F. Simon who had searched divers old MSS tells us that the  Preface <a id="l152"></a>to the Canonical Epistles ascribed to Ierom is found with other Prefaces &amp; such <a id="l153"></a>Latin Copies as have been made not above six hundred years ago: but in <a id="l154"></a>those which were written above 7 or 800 years ago he saith it is extant  <a id="l155"></a>in some few only of such copies &amp; instances in three such old copies which want it &amp;  yet he adds that the <a id="l156"></a> addition of the testimony of the three in heaven is not in most of <a id="l157"></a>those old copies of Ieromes Bible to which  the Preface is prefixt <a id="l158"></a>&amp;  tells us of two copies of this kind one in the King's Library &amp; the other <a id="l159"></a>in M<sup>r</sup> Colbert's.

<p id="par6">The Lateran Council collected under Innocent the third A.C. <a id="l199"></a>1215 can. 2 mentions Ioachim the Abbot quoting the texts in these <a id="l200"></a>words: Quoniam in canonica Ioannis Epistola legitur, <em class="underline">Quia tres sunt <a id="l201"></a>qui testimonium dant in cælo Pater &amp; Verbum et Spiritus et hi tres <a id="l202"></a>unum sunt</em> statimque subjungitur, <em class="underline">et tres sunt qui testimonium dant <a id="l203"></a>in terra spiritus aqua et sanguis et tres unum sunt</em> sicut in codicibus <a id="l204"></a>quibusdam invenitur.

So then till Ioachim the Abbot set the schoolmen <a id="l215"></a>upon disputing about the Trinity this Addition crept but into some MSS <a id="l216"></a>&amp; the most wanted it.</p>
<p id="par7">But to go to the original of the corruption, ✝<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> Gregory <a id="l217"></a>the great writes that Ierome's Version was in use in his <a id="l218"></a>time &amp; therefore no wonder if the testimony of the <a id="l219"></a>three in heaven began to be cited out of it before.  <a id="l220"></a>Eugenius bishop of Carthage in the seventh year of Hunneric king <a id="l221"></a>of the Vandals  A.C. 484, in the summary of his <a id="l222"></a>faith exhibited to that king, cited it the first of any man so far <a id="l223"></a>as I can find: but whether he read the testimony of the three in <a id="l224"></a>heaven before or after that of the other three is uncertain.  A <a id="l225"></a>while after ffulgentius another African bishop disputing against the <a id="l226"></a>same Vandals cited it again &amp; backt it with the forementioned <a id="l227"></a>place of Cyprian applied to the testimony of the three in heaven.  And <a id="l228"></a>so its probable that by that abused  authority of Cyprian it began first <a id="l229"></a>in Afric in the disputes with the ignorant Vandals to get some credit, <a id="l230"></a>&amp; thence at length crept into Europe.  It occurs also in Vigelius <a id="l231"></a>Tapsensis another African Bishop contemporary to Fuglentius.  In <a id="l232"></a>its defense some allege earlier writers, namely the first Epistle <a id="l233"></a>of Pope Hyginus, the first Epistle of Pope Iohn II, the book <a id="l234"></a>of Idacius Clarus against Varimadus &amp; the book de unita Deitate <a id="l235"></a>Trinitatis ascribed to Athanasius.  But Chiffletius who published <a id="l236"></a>the works of Victor Vitensis &amp; Vigilius Tapsensis together, suffi<a id="l237"></a>ciently proves the book against Varimadus to be this Vigilius's <a id="l238"></a>&amp; erroneously ascribed to Idacius.  To the same Vigilius he <a id="l239"></a>asserts also the book de unita Deitate Trinitatis.  Certainly <a id="l240"></a>Athanasius was not its Author. All the Epistle of Hyginus <a id="l241"></a>except the beginning &amp; end, &amp; the first part of the epistle of <a id="l242"></a>Pope  Iohn wherein the testimony of the three in heaven <a id="l243"></a>is cited are nothing else then fragments of the book against <a id="l244"></a>Varimadus, described word for word by some forger of Decretal <a id="l245"></a>Epistles, as may appear by comparing them.  </p>
<p id="par8"> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p120r"> &lt;120r&gt; </span> </p>
<p id="par9">So then Eugenius &amp; his bishops  are the first upon <a id="l264"></a>record who cite the  Addition &amp; they began first to cite it  in their controversies with the ignorant Vandals about 60 years <a id="l266"></a>after Ierome's death.  From  Afric it past into Europe &amp;  there crept silently &amp; slowly into MSS during all <a id="l268"></a>the dark ages  that is for six <a id="l269"></a>hundred years together, there being in all that time no controversies about the <a id="l270"></a>Trinity to   turn mens eyes upon it &amp; spread it faster.       <a id="l278"></a>But at length in the 12<sup>th</sup> &amp; 13<sup>th</sup> Centuries when learning be<a id="l279"></a>gan to revive,  S. Bernard, the Schoolmen Ioachim &amp; the Lateran <a id="l280"></a>Council by their Sermons, disputes &amp; definitions   made it known to all <a id="l282"></a>men &amp; gave it credit.  In the dark ages it crept not into one half <a id="l283"></a>of the MSS &amp; in those which had it  the reading is so <a id="l284"></a>various &amp; uncertain that its plain there was then no certain <a id="l285"></a>authentick reading received.  But when learning revived &amp; new disputes about the Trinity were raised the reading <a id="l286"></a>which  learned men followed in those disputes prevailed above the rest &amp; became <a id="l287"></a>generally received.  ffor this  is plain by the change then made in the order <a id="l288"></a>of the testimonies in heaven &amp; earth.  For the Africans in their  disputes with the Vandals set the Addition of the three in heaven after the testimony <a id="l290"></a>of the spirit water &amp; blood as I gather out of Vigilius Tapsensis <a id="l291"></a>adv<sup>o</sup> Varimadum c. 5 where it is set after:  &amp; the same order was <a id="l292"></a>also followed in  the dark ages <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>in<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l293"></a>almost all the MSS which have this Addition as is plain by the account <a id="l294"></a>we have given of those MSS above.  But about 500 years ago the Schoolmen <a id="l295"></a>&amp; Ioachim in their new disputes about the Trinity  followed <a id="l296"></a>the contrary reading which sets the Addition before the spirit water &amp; blood <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l297"></a>this reading by the authority which it received from them &amp; the Lateran Council has crept into <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p120v"> &lt;120v&gt; </span> all the later MSS &amp; is now become generally received as if it were <a id="l298"></a>of Apostolick authority.

<p id="par13">The history of the corruption in short is this.  ffirst Tertullian &amp; his followers  <a id="l310"></a>the Latines interpreted the  spirit water &amp; blood – – – both <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span></p>
<p id="par14">The arguments alleged for the Testimonies of the three in heaven are the <a id="l311"></a>Authorities of  Tertullian Cyprian Athanasius &amp; Ierome &amp; many Greek Manuscripts <a id="l312"></a>&amp; almost all the Latine ones.</p>
<p id="par15">Tertullians words run thus.  Cæterum,  inquit, de meo sumet [Paracletus] <a id="l313"></a>sicut ipse de Patris: ita connexus Patris in filio &amp; ffilij in Paracleto tres <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>efficit<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l314"></a>cohærentes, alterum ex altero.

And hence Cyprian who  studied the writings of Tertullian &amp; called him his <a id="l320"></a>Master, writes  in this manner.  The Lord saith I &amp; the father am one &amp; again of the ffather <a id="l321"></a>son &amp; holy Ghost it is written:  And these three are one.</p>
<p id="par16">The Socinians here deale too injuriously – – –</p>
<p id="par17">Stephens has indeed put a comma after ἐν τω οὐρανω as if only those words <a id="l322"></a>were wanting in his 7 MSS: but   there is <a id="l323"></a>no MS extant where those words alone are wanting.  The whole 7<sup>th</sup> vers is  wanting in all MSS.  ffour of Stephens 7 MSS <a id="l324"></a>were in the King of ffrance's Library &amp; P. Simon found all the   7<sup>th</sup> vers  <a id="l325"></a>wanting in all the 7 MSS consulted by him in thatthat  Library: &amp; therefore the comma <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>is<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> by mistake <a id="l326"></a>set after οὐρανω &amp; should have been set  the end <a id="l327"></a>of the vers</p>
<p id="par18">So then this interpretation seems to have been invented by the Montanists <a id="l328"></a>for giving countenance to their Trinity: for Tertullian was a Montanist when he wrote this.</p>
<p id="par19">Cyprian tho not a Montanist, yet admired &amp; studied Tertullians writings &amp; <a id="l329"></a>called him his Master, &amp; seems to have followed him in the interpretation of the <a id="l330"></a>text.  ffor he   <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> this Text in such a manner as if he had been just reading  <a id="l331"></a>Tertullian, &amp; was  imitating him.  His words are these.</p>
<p id="par20"> And so its probable that it began first in Afric &amp;  by consequence that some of those Africans who received the interpretation of Tertullian &amp; Cyprian <a id="l332"></a>first noted it in the margin of their books, as it is found noted in the margins of some old <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>books<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l333"></a>still extant, &amp; that in copying after those Books some Scribes began to insert it into <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>texts<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l334"></a>written before the days of Eugenius,  ffulgentius,  &amp; Vigilius &amp; being  got into texts of some <a id="l335"></a>books it soon began to be quoted, &amp; was first quoted by Eugenius in his disputes with <a id="l336"></a>the ignorant Vandals,  &amp; from the Books of the Africans &amp; Ieroms Version <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>by degrees<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l337"></a>crept into the Books of the Europeans.  </p>
