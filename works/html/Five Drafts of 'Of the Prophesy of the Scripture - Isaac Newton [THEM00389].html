<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Chap. <a id="l1"></a><br>Of the Prophesy of the Scripture <a id="l2"></a>of truth.</h2>
<p id="par1">This prophesy begins thus. <em class="underline">And I</em>, saith the Angel, <em class="underline">in the first <a id="l3"></a>year of  Darius the Mede, even I stood to confirm &amp; to strengthen <a id="l4"></a>him.  And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold there shall stand <a id="l5"></a>up yet three kings in Persia</em> [Cyrus, Cambyses &amp; Darius Hystaspes] <a id="l6"></a><em class="underline">&amp; the fourth</em> [Xerxes] <em class="underline">shall be far richer then they all, &amp; by his strength <a id="l7"></a>through his riches shall stir up all against the realm of Greece. And <a id="l8"></a>a mighty king</em> [Alexander the great] <em class="underline">shall stand up that shall <a id="l9"></a>rule with great dominion, &amp; do according to his will. And when <a id="l10"></a>he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken &amp; shall be divided <a id="l11"></a>towards the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity nor <a id="l12"></a>according to his dominion wherewith he ruled. For his kingdom <a id="l13"></a>shall be pluckt up</em> [for Cassander king of Macedon, Lysimachus <a id="l14"></a>king of Thrace, Seleucus king of Syria, &amp; Ptolomy king of Egypt <a id="l15"></a>&amp;] <em class="underline">even for others besides those</em>.</p>
<p id="par2"><span class="ns">☉</span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 1v &gt; </span> <span class="ns">☉</span> After this, the prophetic Angel describes the actions of the kings of Syria &amp; Egypt <a id="l16"></a> by the names of the kings of thee north &amp; south untill the conquest <a id="l17"></a>of the kingdom of Macedon by the Romans which was in the eighth year <a id="l18"></a>of  Antiochus Epiphanes. Antiochus began his reign in the 137<sup>th</sup> <a id="l19"></a>year of the kingdom of the Greeks (1 Maccab. I.10 (&amp; smote Egypt &amp; <a id="l20"></a>returned from thence the first time &amp; spoiled the temple in the 143<sup>d</sup> year <a id="l21"></a>(1 Maccab. I.20) &amp; after two full years, that is in the 145 year (1 <a id="l22"></a>Maccab. I.29, 54) in returning from Egypt the second time, he sur<a id="l23"></a>prized &amp; smote Ierusalem &amp; put a garrison therein &amp; interdicted the <a id="l24"></a>worship in the temple, &amp; commanded that the Iews should leave their <a id="l25"></a>children uncircumcised &amp; that all men should be of one religion <a id="l26"></a>upon pain of death. And on the 15<sup>th</sup> day of the month Casleu in the <a id="l27"></a>same year they set up the abomination of desolation (as the historian <a id="l28"></a>calls it) upon the altar in the temple, &amp; built idol altars throughout <a id="l29"></a>the cities of Iudah, &amp; burnt the books of the law, &amp; commanded that <a id="l30"></a>those that kept them should be put to death. All this was done in the <a id="l31"></a>eighth year of the king. And for pointing out this remarkable period <a id="l32"></a>Daniel pursues the description of the affairs of the kings of the north <a id="l33"></a>&amp; south very particularly untill he comes to it, &amp; then describes it by <a id="l34"></a>telling us that the king of the north <em class="underline">at the time appointed shall return <a id="l35"></a>&amp; come toward the south</em> a second time: <em class="underline">but the latter</em> expedition <a id="l36"></a><em class="underline">shall not be as the former. For the ships of Chittim shall come <a id="l37"></a>against him. Therefore he shall be grieved &amp; return</em> from the <a id="l38"></a>south, that is from Egypt, <em class="underline">&amp; have indignation against the holy <a id="l39"></a>covenant: so shall he do, he shall even return</em> [out of Egypt] <em class="underline">&amp; have <a id="l40"></a>intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant</em>. And when he <a id="l41"></a>hath thus carried on the description of the affairs of the kings of the north <a id="l42"></a>&amp; south to the eighth year of Antiochus Epiphanes he passes from the <a id="l43"></a>affairs of the Greeks to those of the Romans &amp; describes them by much <a id="l44"></a>larger steps then he had done those of the Greeks. In the prophesy <a id="l45"></a>of the Ram &amp; He Goat its said that  after one of the four <a id="l46"></a>horns of the Goat came forth a little horn &amp; waxed exceeding great, <a id="l47"></a>that is, after one of the four  kingdoms of the Greeks came forth a  kingdom of <a id="l48"></a>the Romans: &amp; the same transition is here repeated in the following <a id="l49"></a>manner.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 1r resumes &gt; </span> 

<p id="par4"><em class="underline">And after him arms shall stand up:</em> that is after Antio<a id="l61"></a>chus Epiphanes. As ממלק signifies after the king, Dan.

These arms appear upon  the  body of the Goat by conquering Ma<a id="l63"></a>cedon &amp; stand up gra<a id="l64"></a>dually by conquering   Illyricum, Carthage &amp;  Afric, Asia, Armenia, Syria <a id="l65"></a>Iudæa, France, Spain, Britain, &amp; Egypt. And then <em class="underline">they pollute <a id="l66"></a>the sanctuary of strength &amp; take away the daily sacrifice</em>  [in the days of Nero &amp; Vespatian] <em class="underline">&amp; place the abomination <a id="l68"></a>which maketh desolate</em> [in the days of Adrian.] <em class="underline">And they that <a id="l69"></a>understand among the people</em> [the Apostles &amp; other Christian <a id="l70"></a>teachers] <em class="underline">shall instruct many, yet they shall fall</em> [in the heathen <a id="l71"></a>persecutions] <em class="underline">by the sword &amp; by flame &amp; by captivity &amp; by spoile <a id="l72"></a>many days. Now when they shall fall they shall be holpen with <a id="l73"></a>a little help</em> [in the reign of Constantine the great] <em class="underline">but many</em> <a id="l74"></a>[pretending to come over to them from the heathens] <em class="underline">shall <a id="l75"></a>cleave to them with flatteries</em> [being still heathens in their <a id="l76"></a>hearts &amp; feigning themselves Christians for the sake of interest <a id="l77"></a>&amp; preferment.] <em class="underline">And</em> [under them] <em class="underline">some of those of understanding <a id="l78"></a>shall fall to try them &amp; to purge &amp; to make them white even to the <a id="l79"></a>time of the end, because it is yet for a time appointed</em>.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span>
<p id="par5">In the reign of Constantine the great when the Christians were <a id="l80"></a>holpen with a little help, the heathen Empire began to fall &amp; thereby <a id="l81"></a>to fill the Christian churches with dissemblers. And this continued <a id="l82"></a>untill the reign of Iulian the Apostate, Who revived the heathen <a id="l83"></a>Empire for a year &amp; eight months. And after his death it fell again <a id="l84"></a>untill the Emperors Gratian &amp; Theodosius the great rejected the <a id="l85"></a>title of Pontifex maximus of the heathens; which put an end to it. <a id="l86"></a>And then succeeded a mixt religion of the flatterers under a new ponti<a id="l87"></a>fex maximus supported by the Empire. And in this religion <em class="underline">he mag<a id="l88"></a>nified himself above every God</em> &amp; <em class="underline">spake marvellous things against the God of Gods</em> (God the father) the ancient of days) <em class="underline">&amp; together with Mahuzzims</em> (potent <a id="l89"></a>saints the souls of dead men) <em class="underline">honoured a strange God</em> a new God <em class="underline">whom his father knew <a id="l90"></a>not, &amp;  regarded not the lawful desire of weomen</em> in marriage, but set up the profession of monks <a id="l91"></a>&amp; nuns. <a id="l92"></a>And the dominion which introduceth this religion is to <em class="underline">prosper till <a id="l93"></a>the indignation</em> (against the Iews) <em class="underline">be accomplished</em>, Dan. XI.36: that <a id="l94"></a>is till the time of the end, in which <em class="underline">the king of the south</em> (or Empire of the Saracens) <em class="underline">shall</em> arise <a id="l95"></a>&amp; <em class="underline">push at him</em>, &amp; further during <em class="underline">the time times &amp; half a time</em>; &amp; <a id="l96"></a>still further <em class="underline">untill he shall have accomplished to scatter the power <a id="l97"></a>of the holy people</em>, or untill the dispertion of the Iews shall be <a id="l98"></a>accomplished, &amp; they shall return from all nations into their <a id="l99"></a>own land &amp; the sanctuary shall be cleansed. <em class="underline">And then all these <a id="l100"></a>things shall be finished.

<p id="par7">After this the prophetick Angel proceeds to describe the actions of <a id="l119"></a>the kings of Egypt &amp; Syria by the names of the kings of the north &amp; south <a id="l120"></a>untill the conquest of the kingdom of Macedon by the Romans: which <a id="l121"></a>was in the eighth year of Antiochus Epiphanes.

<p id="par8">In the prophesy of the Ram &amp; He-Goat it's said that after one of <a id="l125"></a>the four horns of the Goat came forth a little horn which waxed ex<a id="l126"></a>ceeding great; this little horn being the kingdom of Rome descended from <a id="l127"></a>Kittim the son of Iavan &amp; being grafted into the body of the Goat by conquer<a id="l128"></a>ing Macedon.

And a mighty king</em> [Alexander the <a id="l143"></a>great] <em class="underline">shall</em>  <em class="underline">stand up that shall rule <a id="l144"></a>with great dominion &amp; do according to his will. And when he shall stand <a id="l145"></a>up his kingdom shall be broken &amp; shall be divided towards the four winds <a id="l146"></a>of heaven, but not to his posterity nor according to his dominion where<a id="l147"></a>with he ruled. For his kingdom shall be pluckt up</em> [for Cassander king of <a id="l148"></a>Macedon, Lysimachus king of Thrace, Seleucus king of Syria, &amp; Ptolomy <a id="l149"></a>king of Egypt &amp;] <em class="underline">even for others besides those</em>.</p>
<p id="par10">After this the prophetick Angel describes the actions of the kings <a id="l150"></a>of Egypt &amp; Syria by the names of the kings of the north &amp; south untill the <a id="l151"></a>conquest of the kingdom of Macedon by the Romans,  which was in the eighth year of Antiochus Epiphanes. <a id="l153"></a>And for pointing out this remarkable period, he pursues this description very particularly <a id="l154"></a>untill he comes to it. And then he passes from the affairs of the Greeks to those <a id="l155"></a>of the Romans &amp; describes them by much larger steps. // In the prophesy of the <a id="l156"></a>Ram &amp; He Goat its said that after one of the four horns of the Goat came <a id="l157"></a>forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great;  the kingdom of Macedon being one of the four, &amp; the  little horn which <a id="l159"></a>succeeded it &amp; waxed exceeding great being the Romans: &amp; the same thing is here repeated    in the <a id="l161"></a>following man<a id="l162"></a>ner.</p>
<p id="par11"><em class="underline">And after him arms shall stand up:</em> that is, after  Antiochus Epiphanes. <a id="l163"></a>As ממלך signifies after the king Dan.

These arms stand up gradually by conquering Macedon, Afric, Asia, <a id="l165"></a>Armenia, Syria, Iudæa,  France, Spain, Britain, &amp; Egypt. And then <em class="underline">they pol<a id="l166"></a>lute the sanctuary of strength &amp;  take away the daily sacrifice</em> [in the days <a id="l167"></a>of Nero,] <em class="underline">&amp; place the abomination which maketh desolate</em> [in the days of <a id="l168"></a>Adrian.] <em class="underline">And they that understand among the people</em> [the Apostles &amp; other Christian teachers] <em class="underline">shall instruct many, yet they shall fall</em> [in <a id="l169"></a>the heathen persecutions] <em class="underline">by the sword &amp; by flame &amp; by captivity &amp; by <a id="l170"></a>spoile many days.

<div><h2 id="hd4" class="cent">Chap. V <a id="l212"></a><br>On the prophesy of the scripture <a id="l213"></a>of truth.</h2>
<p id="par14">This prophesy was given in the third year of Cyrus over the Persians <a id="l214"></a>which was his first year over the Medes, &amp; it commences from thence. <em class="underline">Behold</em>, <a id="l215"></a>saith the angel, <em class="underline">there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia</em> [Cyrus, <a id="l216"></a>Cambyses &amp; Darius Hystaspis,] <em class="underline">&amp; the fourth</em> [Xerxes] <em class="underline">shall be far richer then <a id="l217"></a>they all, &amp; by his strength through his riches he shall  stir up all <a id="l218"></a>against the realm of Greece</em>. And then he passes on to the rise of the <a id="l219"></a>Greek Empire, saying. <em class="underline">And a mighty king</em> [Alexander the great] <em class="underline">shall stand <a id="l220"></a>up, that shall rule with great dominion &amp; do according to his will. And <a id="l221"></a>when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken &amp; shall be divided <a id="l222"></a>toward the four winds of heaven, &amp; not to his posterity nor according <a id="l223"></a>to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be pluckt up for <a id="l224"></a>others besides those</em>. Then he proceeds to describe the actions of two of <a id="l225"></a> the four, the kings of Egypt &amp; Syria, by the names of the kings of the <a id="l226"></a>south &amp; north, &amp; carries on the description very particularly till he comes <a id="l227"></a>to the eighth year of Antiochus Epiphanes, the year in which the kingdom of Macedon was conquered by the Romans &amp; Antiochus Epiphanes upon the <a id="l228"></a> news thereof was frighted out of Egypt, &amp; coming into Iudæa spoiled <a id="l229"></a>the temple.  He was frighted by the ships of Kittim coming against him with the <a id="l231"></a>Roman embassadors &amp; the news of the conquest of Macedon . And this &amp; the follow<a id="l232"></a>ing victories of Kittim are exprest in these few words: <em class="underline">And after his arms <a id="l233"></a>shall stand up</em>.</p>
<p id="par15">Arms (brachia) are put for armies. And as ממלכ signifies <em class="underline">after <a id="l234"></a>the king</em> Dan. XI.8, so ממנן may signify <em class="underline">after him</em> Dan. XI.31. <em class="underline">After him</em> <a id="l235"></a>armies <em class="underline">shall stand up</em>, the armies of Kittim, that is, of Macedon under the Romans. They rose &amp; stood <a id="l236"></a>up gradually by conquering the Macedonians, Carthaginians, Armeni<a id="l237"></a>ans, Syrians &amp; Egyptians. And these conquests were finished by the fall of <a id="l238"></a>Egypt in the reign of Augustus Cæsar. And then these arms <em class="underline">polluted <a id="l239"></a>the sanctuary of strength &amp; took away the daily sacrifice</em> in the reign <a id="l240"></a>of Nero &amp; Vespasian, <em class="underline">&amp; placed the abomination which maketh desolate</em> <a id="l241"></a>by building a temple to Iupiter Olympius on mount Sion in the reign <a id="l242"></a>of Hadrian. For the building of this temple caused the rebellion of <a id="l243"></a>the Iews under Barchochab, &amp; in this rebellion vast multitudes of the <a id="l244"></a>Iews were slain by the Romans, &amp; in the end of the war the Iews were <a id="l245"></a>expelled Iudea upon pain of death, &amp; their land hath ever since re<a id="l246"></a>mained desolate in respect of them.</p>
<p id="par16">For pointing out the time exactly when the little horn was to <a id="l247"></a>rise up, the prophet describes very particularly the actions of the kings <a id="l248"></a>of the south &amp; north  till he comes down to the eighth year of  <a id="l249"></a>Antiochus Epiphanes, in which the Romans conquered Macedon.

<h2 id="hd5" class="cent">Sect. III. <a id="l252"></a><br>The Scripture of truth interpreted.</h2>
<p id="par17">When the Angel tells Daniel that he was come to <a id="l253"></a>make him understand what shall befall his people in the latter <a id="l254"></a>days, by the latter days he means the days of their captivity <a id="l255"></a>in which the dayly sacrifice should be taken away &amp; the abomi<a id="l256"></a>nation of desolation set up. The daily sacrifice had been taken <a id="l257"></a>away by Nebuchadnezzar, &amp; was newly restored  by the <a id="l258"></a>commission of Cyrus, two years before Daniel received this prophesy, &amp; <a id="l259"></a>was to be taken away again in the latter days. Antiochus Epiphanes <a id="l260"></a>attempted to take it away, but without success. The Romans succeeded <a id="l261"></a>in taking it away &amp; completing the dispersion of the Iews &amp; therefore <a id="l262"></a>the latter days begin in some respect with the attempt of Antiochus, more <a id="l263"></a>properly with the siege of Ierusalem by Vespasian &amp; Titus: at which <a id="l264"></a>time this Prophesy of the Apocalyps was given. And Iohn a little <a id="l265"></a>after in writing his Epistle tells us that it was then the last <a id="l266"></a>time as he knew by the many Antichrists which then began to <a id="l267"></a>appear. Not the very last time, or time of the end, in which the great <a id="l268"></a>Antichrist was to reign, but the latter times in a larger sense <a id="l269"></a>commencing with the appearance of his forerunners. For the <a id="l270"></a>latter times spoken of by Daniel, accordingly as they are taken <a id="l271"></a>in a sense stricter &amp; stricter begin later &amp; later. In the largest <a id="l272"></a>sense they begin with the war of the Romans upon the Iews &amp; taking away of the Iewish sacrifice in <a id="l273"></a>the reign of Nero: in a sense still stricter they begin with the <a id="l274"></a>taking away of the Christian daily worship at the opening of the <a id="l275"></a>seventh seale &amp; revelation of the Man of Sin the King who doth <a id="l276"></a>according to his will: in a sense still stricter they are Daniels <a id="l277"></a>time of the end &amp; begin with the Wo-trumpets &amp;  <a id="l278"></a>comprehend the reign of the Kingdoms of the Locusts &amp; Euphrate<a id="l279"></a>an horsmen called by Daniel the Kings of the South &amp; North. <a id="l280"></a>For when the Angel Gabriel had told Daniel that he was <a id="l281"></a>come to make him understand what shall befall his people in <a id="l282"></a>the latter days, he describes the times down from the reign of <a id="l283"></a>Cyrus to the resurrection of the dead distinguishing them into suc<a id="l284"></a>cessive periods. </p>
<p id="par18">And first he describes the Kings of Persia &amp; Greece &amp; enu<a id="l285"></a>merates the successors of Alexander the Great in Egypt &amp; Syria <a id="l286"></a>down to the invasion of Egypt &amp; Iudea by Antiochus Epiphanes, &amp; there <a id="l287"></a>he begins to tell Daniel what should befall his people. For speak<a id="l288"></a>ing of Antiochus &amp; the King of Egypt, he saith: <em class="underline">And both these <a id="l289"></a>Kings hearts shall be to do mischief, &amp; they shall speak lyes at <a id="l290"></a>one Table</em> [against the Iews &amp; against the Holy covenant,] <em class="underline">but it</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">shall not prosper, for yet the end</em> [in which the daily wor<a id="l291"></a>ship is to be taken away] <em class="underline">shall be at  a time appointed <a id="l292"></a>Then shall he</em> [Antiochus] <em class="underline">return</em> [out of Egypt through Iudea] <em class="underline">into his land with great riches</em> [the spoiles of the Iews] <em class="underline">&amp; his <a id="l293"></a>heart shall be against the holy Covenant</em> [to compass the mis<a id="l294"></a>chief contrived by the two Kings] <em class="underline">&amp; he shall act</em> [against <a id="l295"></a>it] <em class="underline">&amp; return to his own land.

<p id="par22"><em class="underline">And at that time shall Michael stand up the great <a id="l397"></a> Prince which standeth for the children of thy people</em> <a id="l398"></a>[that Michael who overcame the Dragon, that great Prince <a id="l399"></a>of Israel whom Daniel calls the annointed Prince, the King <a id="l400"></a>of Kings &amp; Lord of Lords who comes to the battel of the great <a id="l401"></a>day  with an army on white horses &amp; a two edged sword <a id="l402"></a>in his mouth.] <em class="underline">And</em> [when the king of the north goes forth <a id="l403"></a>with great  wrath to make away many] <em class="underline">there shall be a time <a id="l404"></a>of trouble such as there never was since there was a <a id="l405"></a>nation till that same time. And at that time thy people</em> [who <a id="l406"></a>are newly returned from the nations &amp; dwell without walls <a id="l407"></a>having neither gates nor bars] <em class="underline">shall be delivered</em> [from the <a id="l408"></a>army of Gog, &amp; shall come out of the great tribulation with <a id="l409"></a>palm branches in their hands] <em class="underline">every one who shall be found <a id="l410"></a>written in the book.

And they that be teachers shall shine as the bright<a id="l415"></a>ness of the firmament, &amp; they that turn many to righteousness <a id="l416"></a>as the stars for ever &amp; ever.

<p id="par23">After this Prophesy has thus in continual order of time been brought <a id="l417"></a>down to the first resurrection; the Angel being asked, How long shal <a id="l418"></a>be [the time of] the end of these wonders, <em class="underline">sware by him that liveth for <a id="l419"></a>ever,  that is shall be for a time,  times &amp; an half, and <a id="l420"></a>when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy People</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span> by bringing them back from their long captivity] <em class="underline">all these <a id="l421"></a>things shall be finished.

[So long it shall be to <a id="l433"></a>the victory over Gog: for  blessed are they (the fowls of the air) which are called to the <a id="l434"></a>marriage supper of the Lamb, Apoc. 19.9, 17.
