<p id="par1">Sir</p>
<p id="par2">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz Letter of <span class="hspac-n" title="12 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> is like  the rest of his <a id="l1"></a>Letters &amp;  all of them  full of  <a id="l4"></a>assertions accusations &amp;  railing reflexions without proving any <a id="l5"></a>thing.  And by this character you may guess at the Author of that <a id="l6"></a>Libel.</p>
<p id="par3">He is unwilling to acknowledge himself the Aggressor, &amp; complains <a id="l7"></a>that the Passage in the Acta Lipsiensia of Ianuary 1715 alleged against him, has been poison<a id="l8"></a>ed by a malicious interpretation of a man who would pick a quarrel. <a id="l9"></a>In the  Introduction to the  Book of Quadratures I affirmed that I found <a id="l10"></a>the Method of fluxions gradually in the years 1665 &amp; 1666. And in <a id="l11"></a>opposition to this the  said Acta in giving an Account of the said Introduction we <a id="l12"></a>represent that for the better undersstanding the said Introduction we <a id="l13"></a>must have recourse to the Differential Method cujus elementa ab <a id="l14"></a>Inventore Dn. Gothofredo Gulielmo Leibnitio in his Actis sunt tradita <a id="l15"></a>varijque usus tum ab ipso, tum a Dom. fratribus Bernoullijs tum &amp; <a id="l16"></a>D<sup>no</sup> Marchione Hospitalio  sunt ostensi. Pro diffentijs <a id="l17"></a>igitur Leibnitianis Dn. Newtonus adhibet semperque adhibuit <em class="underline">fluxiones</em> <a id="l18"></a>quæ sint quamproxime ut fluentium augmenta æqualibus tempo<a id="l19"></a>ris particulis quam minimis genita; ijsque tum in suis Principijs <a id="l20"></a>Naturæ Mathematicis, tum in alijs postea editis eleganter est <a id="l21"></a>usus, quemadmodum et Honoratus Fabrius in sua Synopsi Geome<a id="l22"></a>trica, motuum progressus Cavallerianæ Methodo substituit. And then <a id="l23"></a>they go on to explain the method &amp; character of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz instead <a id="l24"></a>of that of M<sup>r</sup> Newton.  But they that read &amp; compare the Introduction to <a id="l25"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton's book of Quadratures,  the whole Account given thereof in the <a id="l28"></a>Acta Eruditorum, the Answers of D<sup>r</sup> Keill  &amp; the Answer of M<sup>r</sup> Leib<a id="l29"></a>nitz to the Doctor dated 29 Decem.  1711, will find the contrary. The matter is suffici<a id="l30"></a>ently stated in the  Commercium Epistolicum, &amp; I need not <a id="l31"></a>repeat it.  In the Preface to the book of Quadratures I wrote <a id="l32"></a>that I  found the method of fluxions gradually in the years 1665 &amp; 1666 . <a id="l33"></a>The Acta gave a contrary account of the method,   &amp; <a id="l34"></a> M<sup>r</sup> justified justified this account &amp; thereby made it his own.</p>

<p id="par4" class="i0">&amp; gives a contrary Interpretation of his own, saying that the words <em class="underline">adhibet <em class="doubleunderline">semperque</em> adhibuit</em> imply that I used fluxions not only after <a id="l35"></a>I had seen his differences, but even before; as if <em class="underline">pro differentijs L . . . anis <a id="l36"></a>D. N . . . us adhibet semper adhibuit fluxiones</em> quemadmodum I H. Fabrius motuum progressus  could signify that  I used <a id="l37"></a>fluxions  before M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz used Differences or I knew that he used them. In the Introduction to <a id="l38"></a>the Book of Quadratures I affirmed – – – instead of that of M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l39"></a>And M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Letter of 29 Decem: 1711, has justified all this &amp; <a id="l40"></a>made it his own.  If he that interpreted the word adhibuit by the word <a id="l41"></a>substituit has poisoned this Vassage in the Acta by a malitious interpretation the  crime is his that wrote the <a id="l42"></a>Passage.</p>
<p id="par5">And as for his suggesting that I might be willing to find a pre<a id="l43"></a>tence to ascribe to my self the invention of the new calculus contrary <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p421r-a"> &lt;421r&gt; </span> to my  knowledge owned in my Principles p. 253 in the first Edition: <a id="l44"></a>its well known here that this controversy was begun between him &amp; <a id="l45"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Keill before I knew what  had been published in the Acta <a id="l46"></a>Leipsica. </p>


<p id="par6" class="i0"> D<sup>r</sup> Barrows method of tangents was published in the year 1670. M<sup>r</sup> Gregory the <a id="l47"></a>same year in his Letter above mentioned gave notice that from D<sup>r</sup> Barrows method <a id="l48"></a>of Tangents compared with his own he had deduced a general method of  drawing <a id="l49"></a>tangents without calculation. M<sup>r</sup> Slusius also in the year 1672 gave notice to M<sup>r</sup> Olden<a id="l50"></a>burg that he had  such an easy method of Tangents. M<sup>r</sup> Collins  there<a id="l51"></a>upon gave me notice of these methods of Tangents &amp; desired that I would send <a id="l52"></a> my method. Thereupon I wrote my Letter of 10 Decem 1672 wherein I <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from above the line &gt; </span>I described my met<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p421r-b"> &lt;421r&gt; </span>hod &amp;<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 421r resumes &gt; </span> repre<a id="l53"></a>sented that I took  it to be the same with that of Slusius &amp; <a id="l54"></a>Gregory &amp; added that it was a branch or rather a corollary of a general method which <a id="l55"></a>without any troublesome calculation extended not only to tangents of all sorts of Curves but also <a id="l56"></a>to other abstruser sorts of Problemes concerning the Curvatures, Areas, Lengths, <a id="l57"></a>centers of gravity of Curves &amp;c  And was not (like the method of  maxima &amp; minima <a id="l58"></a>of Hudde)  restrained to equations free from surdes; &amp; that I had interwoven <a id="l59"></a>this method with that of infinite series, meaning in  the Tract which I  wrote the <a id="l60"></a>year before, as M<sup>r</sup> Collins mentioned in his Letters  to Borellus &amp; Vernon in December 1675 <a id="l61"></a>And M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz a year after he had  received copies of these <a id="l62"></a>Letters &amp; eight months after he had seen my  other <a id="l63"></a>Letters in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins (amongst which I reccon my Analysis per æquatio<a id="l64"></a>nes numero terminorum infinitas [&amp; my letter of 24 Octob. 1676 the newly arrived <a id="l65"></a>at London but not yet copied) sent back  D<sup>r</sup> Barrows method of tangents <a id="l66"></a>with the characteristick changed &amp; explained how this method  readily gave the method <a id="l67"></a>of tangents of Gregory &amp; Slusius, &amp; might be improved so as  not to stop at fractions &amp; surds, &amp; faciliated quadratures, &amp; from these <a id="l69"></a>characters he concluded that this method was like that which I had described in my Letters. <a id="l70"></a>And this  is the Differential method  which was mentioned  in my book of Principles pag <a id="l71"></a> 253, 254, &amp; is now claimed by M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz as the first inventor thereof, notwith<a id="l72"></a>standing that he had notice of  all this by my Letters  of earlier <a id="l73"></a>date compared with that of Gregory &amp; that I had written a treatise of this method &amp; of the method of series <a id="l74"></a>together in the year 1671.  </p>

<p id="par8"> The  Mathematician to whom M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz appealed <a id="l92"></a>from the R Society I called a Mathematicion or pretended Mathematician not  <a id="l93"></a>to disparage the skill of M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli but because the Mathematician in <a id="l94"></a>his Letter of 7 Iune 1673 cited M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli as a person  different from <a id="l95"></a>himself &amp;  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  has lately  caused the Letter to be reprinted without the citation &amp; tells us <a id="l96"></a>that the Mathematician was Iohn Bernoulli himself, &amp;  whether the Mathematician or M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz is to be be<a id="l97"></a>leived I do not yet know.</p>
<p id="par9">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz saith that the Letter which I call defamatory being no <a id="l98"></a>sharper then that  which has been published against him, I have no reason <a id="l99"></a>to complain. But the sharpness of the  Letter <a id="l100"></a>lies in accusations &amp; reflexions without any proofe <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from above the line &gt; </span>  which is an unlawful way of w<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p421r-c"> &lt;421r&gt; </span>riting<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 421r resumes &gt; </span>, the sharpness of the Commercium lies <a id="l101"></a>in facts which are lawfull to be produced,  such as is the fact that <a id="l102"></a> after  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had received the series of Gregory twice from London, he <a id="l103"></a>sent it  to me &amp; published it in Germany as his own without mentioning that he <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p421dr"> &lt;421r&gt; </span> had received it from London:  And further, the Letter was published in <a id="l104"></a>a clandestine backbiting manner without the name of the author or mathematician or <a id="l105"></a>printer or City where it was printed. And it was dispersed two years &amp; a <a id="l106"></a> quarter before  we were told that the Mathematician  was Iohn Ber<a id="l107"></a>noulli.</p>
<p id="par10">He saith that when he was the first time in London he was not acquainted With M<sup>r</sup> Collins as some have <a id="l108"></a>maliciously feigned. But who has feigned this or what need there was to feign it I do not know. D<sup>r</sup> Pell gave <a id="l109"></a>him notice of Mercators series for the Hyperbola &amp; he might have notice <a id="l110"></a>of mine  for the circle  either in London or at Paris without <a id="l111"></a>being acquainted with M<sup>r</sup> Collins.</p>
<p id="par11">He saith that he found the  arithmetical Quadrature of <a id="l112"></a>the Circle towards the end of the year 1673  the general method  arbitrary series &amp;  in the year 1676 &amp; soon after the differential calculus in the same year &amp; that in his Letter of 27 Aug. 1676 by the words certa Analysi he meant the differential Analysis. And am not I as good an evidence that I found the <a id="l114"></a>method of fluxions in the year 1665 &amp; improved it in the year 1666. And <a id="l115"></a>if I should add that before the end of  the year 1666 I wrote a small tract <a id="l116"></a>on this subject which was the grownd of that larger tract which I wrote in <a id="l117"></a>the year 1671, &amp;  in this smaller tract, tho I generally put letters for <a id="l118"></a>fluxions as D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in his method of tangents put Letters for  <a id="l119"></a>differences, yet in giving a general Rule for  finding the curvature <a id="l120"></a>of curves I put the  letter <span class="large">x</span> with one prick for first fluxions <a id="l121"></a>&amp; with two pricks for second fluxions:  am not I as good an evidence <a id="l122"></a>for this as M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz is for what he affirms;  especially since both thse <a id="l123"></a>Tracts are still in being &amp; ready to be produced upon occasion.</p>
<p id="par12">In the year 1684 M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz published only the elements of <a id="l124"></a>the Calculus differentialis &amp;  applied them to questions about tangents <a id="l125"></a>&amp; maxima &amp; minima but proceeded not to the higher Problemes. The <a id="l126"></a>Principia mathematica gave the first instances made publick of ap<a id="l127"></a>plying it to the higher Problemes &amp; I understood M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in this sense <a id="l128"></a>in what I said concerning the Acta Eruditorum for May 1700. But <a id="l129"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz observes that what was there said by him relates only to a <a id="l130"></a>particular artifice  de maximis et minimis with which    he there allowed <a id="l131"></a>that I was acquainted  when I gave the figure of my vessel <a id="l132"></a>in my Principles. But this depending upon the differential method as an improvement thereof &amp; being the artifice by which they solved the Problemes <a id="l133"></a>which they value themselves most upon (that of the linea celerrimi descensus <a id="l134"></a>&amp; the Catenaria, &amp; velaria) &amp; which M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz there calls  a method of the <a id="l135"></a>highest moment &amp;  of greatest extent,  I content my self with <a id="l136"></a>his acknowledgment that I was the first that proved by a specimen made <a id="l137"></a>publick that I had that artifice.</p>
<p id="par13">D<sup>r</sup> Barrow  printed his differential method of Tangents in 1670 <a id="l138"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Gregory   from this method deduced a general <a id="l139"></a>method of Tangents without calculation &amp; by his Letter of 5 Sep. 1670 gave <a id="l140"></a>notice thereof to M<sup>r</sup> Collins. Slusius in November 1672 gave notice of the <a id="l141"></a>like method to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburge. I in my Letter of 10 Decem 1672 sent <a id="l142"></a>the like method to M<sup>r</sup> Collins &amp; added that I tooke the Methods of Slusius <a id="l143"></a>&amp; Gregory to be the same with mine, &amp; that it was but a branch or rather a Corollary <a id="l144"></a>of a general method which without any troublesom calculation extended to <a id="l145"></a>not only to Tangents but also to other abstruser sorts of Problems concerning <a id="l146"></a>the crookednesses, areas lengths centers of gravity of Curves &amp;c &amp; this <a id="l147"></a>without stopping at  surds: &amp; added that I had interwoven this method with <a id="l148"></a>that of infinite series.  meaning in my Tract which was written in 1671 Copies of these Letters <a id="l149"></a>were sent to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz by M<sup>r</sup> D. in the Collection of Gregories  Letters &amp; Papers <a id="l150"></a>in Iune 1676 &amp;  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in Iune his Letter of 21 1677 sent nothing more back <a id="l151"></a>then  Barrows Method of Tangents extend to the method of Slusius &amp; to Quadratures &amp; equations involving surds: all which he had notice of by these letters. But this is not the case between me &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p421v"> &lt;421v&gt; </span> D<sup>r</sup> Barrow. He saw my Analysis in the year 1669 &amp; found no fault with it. And when he was publishing his Lectures I told him of my method of drawing Tangents without any compu<a id="l152"></a>tation, as I mention <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>in<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> my Letter of 10 Decem 1672. but he did not extend his method so far.</p>
<p id="par14">He tells us that in his Letter of 27 Aug. 1676 where he speaks of <a id="l153"></a>Problemes which depend not on equations nor quadratures he meant only equations <a id="l154"></a>of the vulgar Analysis. But   the words plainly relate <a id="l155"></a> to the reducing of Problems  generally <a id="l156"></a>not to vulgar equations but to infinite series &amp; doing it in the difficulter cases  by other methods <a id="l157"></a>then the extracting the roots of vulgar equations. In the next words he said <a id="l158"></a>that he solved the Probleme of De Beaune certa Analysi  &amp; this Ana<a id="l159"></a>lysis he saith was the  Differential. But  the Analysis in this case doth not require a differential <a id="l161"></a>equation. Any one may presently see that if the  Abscissa of this <a id="l162"></a>Curve increase in  Arithmetical proportion the  Ordinate shall <a id="l163"></a>increase or decrease in Geometrical, &amp; therefore the Ordinate hath the same relation <a id="l164"></a>to the Abscissa as the  Logarithm to its Number. <a id="l165"></a>&amp; this is all the Analysis requisite.</p>
<p id="par15">In my Answer dated 24 Octob. 1676 I said Inversa de tangentibus Problemata sunt in potestate aliaque illis difficiliora. And a little after Inversum hoc Problema de <a id="l166"></a>Tangentibus quando Tangens inter punctum contactus et axem  [seu Abscissam] figuræ est datæ <a id="l167"></a>longitudinis non indiget his methodis. Est tamen Curva illa Mechanica cujus <a id="l168"></a>determinatio pendet ab Area Hyperbolæ. Ejusdem generis est etiam Problema <a id="l169"></a>quando pars Axis  inter Tangentem et Ordinatim applicatam datur <a id="l170"></a>Longitudine.  Sed hos casus vix numeraverim inter ludos <a id="l171"></a>Naturæ. Nam quando  in triangulo rectangulo quod ab illa Axis parte <a id="l172"></a>et Tangente ac Ordinatim Applicata constituitur, relatio duorum quorumlibet <a id="l173"></a>laterum per æquationem quamlibet definitur, Problema solvi potest absque mea <a id="l174"></a>methodo Generali: Sed ubi pars axis ad punctum aliquod positione datum <a id="l175"></a>terminata ingreditur vinculum; res aliter se habere solet; id est, Problema  <a id="l176"></a> indigere solet mea methodo generali.</p>

<p id="par29">4 The Royal Society &amp; their Committee have acted by good authority &amp; <a id="l310"></a> in a regular manner &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz has no authority to call them to ac<a id="l311"></a>count. If at his command they would have condemned D<sup>r</sup> Keill without exa<a id="l312"></a>mining into the matter they would have been honest Gentlemen. But when <a id="l313"></a>he in his Letter of 29 Decem 1711 refused to justify his accusation &amp; put them upon a necessity of  ap<a id="l314"></a>pointing a Committee to examin old Letters &amp; Papers relating to this <a id="l315"></a>matter &amp; report their opinion thereupon that the Society might know <a id="l316"></a>what was fit  for them to do therein; &amp; the Society ordered the letters &amp; papers <a id="l317"></a>with the Report to be published:  he appealed from them to a  mathematician of his <a id="l318"></a>own chusing &amp; by consequence a  party-man  <a id="l319"></a>&amp;  &amp; desired him to give his opinion upon the Com<a id="l320"></a>mercium. And this Mathematician in his Answer dated 7 Iuly 1713 <a id="l321"></a>cited Iohn Bernoulli as a man different from himself in these words <a id="l322"></a>[quemadmodum ab eminente quodam Mathematico dudum notatum est] <a id="l323"></a>And this Letter wsa inserted into a defamatory Letter dated 29 Iuly 1673 <a id="l324"></a>&amp; published  in Germany without the name of the Author or Mathematician <a id="l325"></a> or Libeller or Printer or City where it was printed. <a id="l326"></a>  &amp;  the impression dispersed by M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; his <a id="l327"></a>Agents &amp; reprinted in French in the Iournal Literair  <a id="l328"></a>of November &amp; December 1713 &amp; answered by D<sup>r</sup> Keill in the Iournal <a id="l329"></a>of Iuly &amp; August 1714. And the Letter of the Mathematitian was re<a id="l330"></a>printed in Latin in the Novelles Litterairs for 28 Decem 1675  <a id="l333"></a>without mentioning that it had been answered by Keill, &amp; to give it <a id="l334"></a>authority, it is there said to have been written by Iohn Bernoulli <a id="l335"></a>&amp; the citation above mentioned whereby the author distinguishes him <a id="l336"></a>self from Iohn Bernoulli is omitted.  And therefore being uncertain whether this Mathe<a id="l338"></a>matician be Iohn Bernoulli or some other man, I called him (in my Letter <a id="l339"></a>of  26 Feb:  last) a Mathematician or pretended Mathematician. <a id="l340"></a> intending by those words not to  detract from the skill of <a id="l341"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli  (as M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz complains) but to  touch upon <a id="l342"></a>the  tricking, double-faced, maskerading management of the <a id="l343"></a>Libel.</p>
<p id="par30">5 M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz represents that this paper being no sharper <a id="l344"></a>then the Commercium Epistolicum I have no reason to complain. <a id="l345"></a>But the difference is that this  paper  has all the characters of a defamatory Libel being full of reflecting affirmations without <a id="l346"></a>any proof  &amp; printed &amp; dispersed in a clandestin manner without <a id="l347"></a>naming the author printer or City where it was printed. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz saith that <a id="l348"></a>the Mathematician whose Letter was inserted into it was nkown which is sufficient <a id="l349"></a>but it was not known  till above two years after the Libel was dispersed <a id="l350"></a>And if it had been known sooner, yet the Mathematician is not answera<a id="l351"></a>ble for the Libell unless so far as he had a hand in it: whereas <a id="l352"></a>the Comerc. Epist. was published fairly at London by Order of the R. S. &amp; has nothing <a id="l353"></a>of sharpness in it but what is  in the facts comprehended in or proved by the ancient Letters &amp; papers. <a id="l354"></a>  And this way of writing is allowed by all mankind.</p>

<p id="par31">6. He complains of the Committee as partial, &amp; set sup Iohn Ber<a id="l355"></a>noulli against them &amp; to give the preference to this great Mathe<a id="l356"></a>matician  challenges them to solve  one of his Problemes.  But what solving of Problemes has to do in this matter <a id="l358"></a>I do not understand. The Committee without  any skill in mathema<a id="l359"></a>ticks might search out the old Letters &amp; papers &amp; shew them to <a id="l360"></a>witnesses who knew the hands,  &amp;  nothing more. <a id="l368"></a>then their testimony is wanted in this matter.    <a id="l370"></a>And all Bernoullis skill in Mathematicks avails nothing against this <a id="l371"></a>evidence.  </p>
<p id="par32">7 But M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz represents that the Committe have omitted <a id="l374"></a>things which made against me &amp; printed every thing which could be <a id="l375"></a>turned against him by strained glosses, &amp; to make this appear he <a id="l376"></a>produced an instance in his last Letter, but  confesses now that he erred in <a id="l377"></a>that instance affirming that the passage was omitted in the Commerc. &amp;  he produces another instance. He saith that  in <a id="l378"></a>one of my Letters to M<sup>r</sup> Collins I owned that I could not find the <a id="l379"></a>second segments of Spheroids, &amp; that the Committee have omitted this <a id="l380"></a> If the Committee had omitted such a Letter I think they would <a id="l381"></a>have done right, it being nothing to the purpose. But there was <a id="l382"></a>no such Letter. M<sup>r</sup> Collins in a Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Gregory dated 24 <a id="l383"></a>Decem 1670 &amp; printed in the Commercium pag. 24, wrote that my method extended to the second segments <a id="l384"></a>of round solids, &amp;  I heare that the Letter in which I signified this to <a id="l385"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Collins is still extant &amp; conteins the dimension of the second <a id="l386"></a>segment of the Sphæroid, so that it makes as much for me as M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz pretends that it makes <a id="l387"></a>against me  &amp; yet <a id="l390"></a>I do not complain of the Committee for omitting it. But I complain of <a id="l391"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz for accusing the Committee of partiality  without knowing wherein they were partial. <a id="l393"></a>For this rashness shews the spirit of the Gentleman.</p>

<p id="par33">Sir</p>

<p id="par35"> In my Letter of 24 Octob 1676 I represented that five years <a id="l424"></a>before that time, that is in the year 1671, I wrote a Book of this Method <a id="l425"></a>&amp; the method of Series together, but for the sake of quiet desisted from my <a id="l426"></a> designe of publishing it. The Book is still in being &amp; conteins <a id="l427"></a>a very plain description of those two methods. The first Proposition of the <a id="l428"></a>book is, Relatione quantitatum fluentium inter se data fluxionum <a id="l429"></a>relationem determinare. In the year 1685 M<sup>r</sup> Iohn Craig desire<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>d<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> me <a id="l430"></a>to explain to him the elements of the differential Calculus then newly <a id="l431"></a>published in the Acta Eruditorum. I did so &amp; told him that the method <a id="l432"></a>was mine as would appear if the Letters which past between me &amp; M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l433"></a>Leibnitz seven or eight years before should be published, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Craig <a id="l434"></a>is still alive &amp; remembers this. D<sup>r</sup> Wallis in the Preface to the two <a id="l435"></a>first Volumes of his works printed in Spring, 1695, wrote that in those <a id="l436"></a>Letters (copies of which had been communicated to him by M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburgh I had explained to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz that Method found by me ten <a id="l437"></a>years before or above, that is, in the year 1666 or before. In the <a id="l438"></a>Account of these two Volumes published in the Acta Eruditorum the <a id="l439"></a>next year, this passage was taken notice of &amp; not contradicted. D<sup>r</sup> Wallis <a id="l440"></a>in a Letter dated 1 Decem. 1696 gave notice of this passage to M<sup>r</sup> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p424v"> &lt;424v&gt; </span> Leibnitz &amp; in the Letters which followed between them it was not con<a id="l441"></a>tradicted. M<sup>r</sup> Fatio in the year 1699 published that I was the  <a id="l442"></a>oldest inventor by many years &amp; confirmed his opinion by what he had seen <a id="l443"></a>in my manuscripts, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his answer did not contradict him <a id="l444"></a>And all this was done without any encouragement from me. In the <a id="l445"></a>year  1704 I published (in the Introduction to my book of Quadratures) <a id="l446"></a>that I found the method of fluxions by degrees in the year 1665 &amp; <a id="l447"></a>1666. For this was not yet disputed. But D<sup>r</sup> Wallis, (the last of the old <a id="l448"></a>men who had corresponded with M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Collins in these <a id="l449"></a>matters, except M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; my self being now dead, somebody in <a id="l450"></a>the Acta Eruditorum for Ianuary  1705, in giving an account <a id="l451"></a>of the  said Introduction told his Reader that for the better understanding <a id="l452"></a>this Introduction we must have recourse to the Differential method <a id="l453"></a><em class="underline">cujus elementa ab</em> INVENTORE <em class="underline">Dn. G. G. L . . . tio in his Actis sunt tradita</em>. <a id="l454"></a>And then added: <em class="underline">Pro Differentijs IGITVR Leibnitianis Dn. Newtonus adhibet <a id="l455"></a>semperque adhibuit fluxiones</em> — <em class="underline">QVEMADMODVM et Honoratus Fabrius in <a id="l456"></a>sua Synopsi Geometrica motuum progressus Cavallerianæ methodo substituit</em>. <a id="l457"></a>And hereby the world was told that I did not invent the method so early <a id="l458"></a>as has been beleived in England nor write a book upon it in the year <a id="l459"></a>1671 nor mention it in my Letters of 13 Iune, &amp; 24 Octob 1676 &amp; 10 <a id="l460"></a>Decem 1672, nor was the first inventor, but do use &amp; have always used fluxions <a id="l461"></a>for the Leibnitian differences even as Faber substituted motions for <a id="l462"></a>the method of Cavallerius. With this accusation the dispute began, &amp; <a id="l463"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz hath made this accusation his own by saying in his Letter <a id="l464"></a>29 Decem 1711, <em class="underline">Frustra ad exemplum Actorum Lipsiensium</em> [Keilius] <a id="l465"></a><em class="underline">provocat ut sua dicta excuset; in illis enim circa hanc rem <a id="l466"></a>quicquam detractum non reperio sed potius passim suum cuique <a id="l467"></a>tributum</em>. In the same Letter he refused to contend with D<sup>r</sup> Keill <a id="l468"></a>because the Doctor was not authorised by me, &amp; desired that I would <a id="l469"></a>give my opinion in this matter, that is, that I would either condemn <a id="l470"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Keill &amp; retract what D<sup>r</sup> Wallis M<sup>r</sup> Fatio &amp; I had published some <a id="l471"></a>years before &amp; what I had written in the year 1676 &amp; before, or enter <a id="l472"></a>into the lists with him as he expresses  himself in his last Letter. <a id="l473"></a>And by this attaque he is  the Aggressor. He is very angry at the inter<a id="l474"></a>pretation of the words <em class="underline">adhibet semperque adhibuit</em> by the word <em class="underline">substituit</em>. <a id="l475"></a>And yet the Author himself by the words <em class="underline">igitur</em> &amp; <em class="underline">quemadmodum</em> has <a id="l476"></a> interpreted them in that manner.</p>
<p id="par36">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz insinuates that my complaint of his accusing me of <a id="l477"></a>plagiary might be to attribute to my self the invention of the new <a id="l478"></a>calculus contrary to my knowledge avowed to the contrary in my Book <a id="l479"></a>of Principles pag 253 of the first edition. And a little after he saith <a id="l480"></a>that in the first Edition of my Principles p. 253, 254 I allowed him <a id="l481"></a>the invention of the calculus of differences independently of my own <a id="l482"></a>But he accuses me falsly. My words were these. In Litteris quæ mihi <a id="l483"></a>cum Geometra peritissimo G. G. Leibnitio annis abhinc decem intercede<a id="l484"></a>bant [i.e. anno 1676,] cum significarem me compotem esse methodi deter<a id="l485"></a>minandi maximas &amp; minimas, ducendi Tangentes, &amp; similia peragendi <a id="l486"></a>quæ in terminis surdis æque ac in rationalibus procederet, &amp; literis <a id="l487"></a>transpositis hanc sententiam involventibus [Data æquatione quotcunque <a id="l488"></a>fluentes quantitates involvente, fluxiones invenire, &amp; vice versa] <a id="l489"></a>eandem celarem: rescripsit vir clarissimus se quoque in ejusmodi metho<a id="l490"></a>dum incidisse, &amp; methodum suam communicavit a mea vix abluden<a id="l491"></a>tem præterquam in verborum  et notarum formulis. This was re<a id="l492"></a>printed in the second edition of my Principles &amp; is still allowed by me <a id="l493"></a>But I never allowed that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was the first inventor or found <a id="l494"></a>this method without receiving some light from me. M<sup>r</sup> Craige is witness <a id="l495"></a>that in those days I looked upon the method as mine. In Iuly 1676 M<sup>r</sup> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p425r"> &lt;425r&gt; </span> Leibnitz received copies of my Letters dated 10 Decem. 1672 &amp; 13 Iune <a id="l496"></a>1676,  &amp; a copy of M<sup>r</sup> Gregories Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Collins dated <a id="l497"></a>5 Sept. 1670. In October following he came to London &amp; saw some others <a id="l498"></a>of my Letters in the hand of M<sup>r</sup> Collins, &amp; particularly my Letter of 24 <a id="l499"></a>Octob 1676 then newly arrived at London but not yet copied. In March follow<a id="l500"></a>ing a copy of this Letter  upon notice of his being arrived at Hannover <a id="l501"></a>was sent to him. And after all this, in a Letter dated 21 Iune 1677, <a id="l502"></a>he sent me back his method  representing that it was like the <a id="l503"></a>method of which I had given him notice. And what he sent back was nothing <a id="l504"></a> more then what he had sufficient notice of  from my Letters <a id="l505"></a>compared with M<sup>r</sup> Gregories Letter &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Barrows method of tangents.</p>
<p id="par37">This method was published by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in the year 1670, &amp; <a id="l506"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Gregory the same year in his Letter above mentioned gave notice <a id="l507"></a>that from  this method compared with his own he had de<a id="l508"></a>duced a general method of drawing tangents without any calculation <a id="l509"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Slusius also in the year 1672 wrote to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg that he had <a id="l510"></a>such a ready method of Tangents. And thereupon M<sup>r</sup> Collins gave me <a id="l511"></a>notice of these methods &amp; desired that I would send them mine &amp; I <a id="l512"></a>did so in my Letter of 10 Decem 1672, representing that I took it <a id="l513"></a>to be same with that of Slusius &amp; Gregory, &amp; I added that it was a <a id="l514"></a>branch or rather a Corollary of a general method which without any <a id="l515"></a>troublesome calculation extended not only to tangents of all sorts of <a id="l516"></a>Curves but also to other abstruser sorts of Problemes concerning the <a id="l517"></a>curvatures, areas, lengths, centers of gravity of Curves &amp;c and was not <a id="l518"></a>(like  Hudde's method of maxima &amp; <a id="l519"></a>minima) restrained to equations free from surdes; &amp; that I had <a id="l520"></a>interwoven this method with that of infinite series; meaning in the <a id="l521"></a>Tract which I wrote the year before. And M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz a year <a id="l522"></a>after he had received copies of these Letters &amp; eight months after he had <a id="l523"></a>seen my other Letters in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins (amongst which I reccon <a id="l524"></a>my Analysis per æquationes numero terminorum infinitas) sent back D<sup>r</sup> <a id="l525"></a>Barrow's method of tangents with the characteristick changed &amp; explained <a id="l526"></a>how this method readily gave the method of tangents of Gregory &amp; Slusius <a id="l527"></a>&amp; might be improved so as not to stop at  surds &amp; faciliated qua<a id="l528"></a>dratures, &amp; from these characters he concluded that this method was <a id="l529"></a>like that which I had described in my Letters. And this is the differential <a id="l530"></a>method which was mentioned in my book of Principles pag 253 &amp; 254, &amp; <a id="l531"></a>is now claimed by M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz as the first inventor thereof, notwith<a id="l532"></a>standing that he had notice of all this by my Letters of earlier date &amp; <a id="l533"></a>&amp; was told that I had  written a Treatise of this method &amp; of the <a id="l534"></a>method of  series together in the year 1671.</p>

<p id="par38">Sir</p>
<p id="par39">When the Postscript to M<sup>r</sup>  Leibnitz's first Letter  to M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbe Conti was shewed to me, I  did not <a id="l536"></a>think my self concerned to meddle with it, partly because the Letter <a id="l537"></a>was not directed to me, &amp; principally because I observed that his <a id="l538"></a>designe was to lay aside the Records in the Commercium Epistolicum <a id="l539"></a>&amp; engage me in a squabble about Questions nothing to the purpose <a id="l540"></a>such as were: whether  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz found the Differential method proprio <a id="l541"></a>Marte, whether all bodies be heavy, whether I make gravity to be an occult <a id="l542"></a>Scholastic quality  Whether I make it a Miracle Whe<a id="l543"></a>ther God be intelligentia supramundana. Whether  I make him <a id="l544"></a>to be the Soul of the world, whether  I say that he has need of a <a id="l545"></a>sensorium. Whether I have demonstrated a Vacuum. Whether space <a id="l546"></a>be the order of things coexisting &amp; time the order of things suc<a id="l547"></a>cessive. Whether God has made the world so perfect as to last from <a id="l548"></a>all eternity to all eternity by the mere laws of nature. Whether there <a id="l549"></a>be atoms, &amp; whether any body in England can solve the problems of <a id="l550"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Iohn Bernoulli. However at length being pressed by M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé <a id="l551"></a>Conti to  write an Answer that the Postscript with my answer <a id="l552"></a>might be shewed to the King I wrote an Answer dated 26 Febr. 1716. <a id="l553"></a>But when my Answer was sent to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; he sent it with his <a id="l554"></a>answer to M<sup>r</sup> Remond at Paris &amp; his Answer was sent open from Paris <a id="l555"></a>to M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti; I refused to write any thing more to be sent <a id="l556"></a>to him; &amp; only wrote a paper of Remarks upon his Answer &amp; shewed <a id="l557"></a>them privately to some of my friends to satisfy them that it was easy to <a id="l558"></a>have answered his Letter had it come hither directly. And because he had <a id="l559"></a>sent them to be communicated to his friends at Paris, I caused them <a id="l560"></a>to be published as soon as I heard that he was dead, &amp; you may <a id="l561"></a>reprint them with such other Letters as are fallen into your hands <a id="l562"></a>but I see no necessity of writing an Answer to those other Letters. <a id="l563"></a>The Remarks may serve for an Answer to the whole</p>
<p id="par40">I wrote the book of Quadratures in the year 1676 except <a id="l564"></a>the Introduction &amp; Conclusion, extracting most of it out of old <a id="l565"></a>Papers; &amp; when I had finished it &amp; the 7<sup>th</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> 9<sup>th</sup> &amp; 10<sup>th</sup> Propositi<a id="l566"></a>ons with their Corollaries were fresh in memory I wrote upon them to M<sup>r</sup> Collins that <a id="l567"></a>Letter which was dated 8 Novem 1676 &amp; published by M<sup>r</sup> Iones. <a id="l568"></a>He that compares that Letter with those Propositions &amp; particularly <a id="l569"></a>with the second Corollary of the 10<sup>th</sup> Proposition, will easily see <a id="l570"></a>that I had composed those Propositions before I wrote that Letter. <a id="l571"></a>The Tables at the end of the tenth Proposition for squaring of <a id="l572"></a>some Curves &amp; comparing others with the Conic Sections were invented <a id="l573"></a>by the inverse method of fluxions before the year 1671, as may be <a id="l574"></a>understood by my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676. And in the same Letter <a id="l575"></a>where I represented that the general Theoremes there mentioned <a id="l576"></a>for squaring of Curves were invented by the method of fluxions <a id="l577"></a>I meant the direct &amp; inverse method described in the first six <a id="l578"></a>Propositions of the Book of Quadratures. For I know of no other <a id="l579"></a>Method by which those Theorems could be invented. The Book of <a id="l580"></a>Quadratures was therefore composed before M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz understood <a id="l581"></a>the Differential Method.

<p id="par41">M<sup>r</sup> Iames Gregory died  in the end of the year 1675 &amp;  at the <a id="l591"></a>request of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz his  Letters were collected &amp; the Collection sent to <a id="l592"></a>Paris  in Iune following &amp; among them were copies of M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l593"></a>Gregories Letter of 5 Sept 1670 &amp; mine of 10 Decem 1672, &amp; by those <a id="l594"></a>Letters M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had notice that M<sup>r</sup> Barrow's method of Tangents <a id="l595"></a>was capable of improvement so as to give the method of Tangents of <a id="l596"></a>Gregory &amp; that the method of Tangents of Gregory  &amp; Slusius <a id="l597"></a>was capable of improvement so as to give  my general Me<a id="l598"></a>thod of Analysis, &amp; that this Analysis proceeded without sticking at <a id="l599"></a>surds, &amp; that I had interwoven it with the method of Series, viz<sup>t</sup> <a id="l600"></a>in a Tract which I wrote upon this subject in the year 1671. M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l601"></a>Leibnitz wrote also to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg for the Demonstration of some of <a id="l602"></a>my Series, that is for the Method of finding them &amp; promised him a <a id="l603"></a>Reward &amp; told him that M<sup>r</sup> Collins could help him to it, &amp; therefore <a id="l604"></a>he had heard that M<sup>r</sup> Collins had my Method, that is my Analysis <a id="l605"></a>per serires numero terminorum infinitas. For I had sent my Method to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l606"></a>Collins in no other paper then that. M<sup>r</sup> Collins instead of sending <a id="l607"></a>what M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz desired, joyned with Oldenburg  in solliciting <a id="l608"></a>me to answer M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz's Letter. And thereupon I wrote my <a id="l609"></a>Letter of 13 Iune 1676, &amp; after I had described my method of Series <a id="l610"></a>&amp; some other Methods (meaning principally the Method of fluxions) <a id="l611"></a>became so general as to extend to almost all Problemes except perhaps <a id="l612"></a>some numeral ones like those of Diophantus. And M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Letter <a id="l613"></a>of 27 Aug. 1676 replied that he did not belive that the Method was so gene<a id="l614"></a>ral, there being many Problems &amp; particularly the inverse Problems of <a id="l615"></a>Tangents not reducible to equations. And this is another argument that <a id="l616"></a>he had not yet found the differential method.</p>
<p id="par42">In October following he came to London &amp; there met with D<sup>r</sup> <a id="l617"></a>Barrows Lectures &amp; saw my  Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 &amp; therin <a id="l618"></a>had fresh notice of the said method &amp; of my Compendium of series sent by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l619"></a>Collins in the year 1669, under the title of Analysis per series &amp;c. &amp; con<a id="l620"></a>sulting M<sup>r</sup> Collins, saw in his hands several of mine &amp; Gregories Letters <a id="l621"></a>especially those relating to series; &amp; in his way home from London was <a id="l622"></a>meditating how to improve the Method of Tangents of Slusius as appears <a id="l623"></a>by his Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg dated from Amsterdam <span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>18</mn><mn>28</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-6" style="width: 1.099em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 1.095em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.338em, 1001.1em, 3.059em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-7"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-8"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.827em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.68em, 4.204em, -1000em); top: -4.441em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.354em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-9" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">18</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.68em, 4.204em, -1000em); top: -3.593em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.354em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-10" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">28</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1000.83em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 0.827em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.467em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.42em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>18</mn><mn>28</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-2"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>18</mn><mn>28</mn></mfrac></math></script> Novem. 1676. <a id="l624"></a>And the next year in a Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg dated 21 Iune, he sent <a id="l625"></a>us his new Method with this Introduction: <em class="underline">Clarissimi Slusij methodum tan<a id="l626"></a>gentium nondum esse absolutam celeberrimo Newtono assentior</em>.

<p id="par44">At the end of the Remarks – – – – – – – – top of his skill at <a id="l655"></a>that time.</p>
<p id="par45">The Book of Quadratures was written in the year 1676 being <a id="l656"></a>for the most part extracted out of  a Tract which I wrote in <a id="l657"></a>the year 1671 but did not finish &amp; out of some other older Papers. The <a id="l658"></a> first Proposition  <em class="underline">Data æquatione quotcunque fluentes <a id="l659"></a>quantitates involvente invenire fluxiones</em> is comprehended verbatim in <a id="l660"></a>the AEnigma which I set down in my Letter of the 24<sup>th</sup> of October <a id="l661"></a>1676. In that Letter I set down a Series for squaring of figures which in <a id="l662"></a>some cases breaks of &amp; becomes finite, &amp; illustrated it with examples &amp; <a id="l663"></a>said that I found  that &amp; some others of the same kind by the Method  comprised in that Enigma <a id="l664"></a>that is by the Method of fluxions; &amp; how I found them I explained in the first six Propositions of the book <a id="l665"></a>of Quadratures &amp; I do not know of any other method whereby they <a id="l666"></a>could be found; &amp; therefore when I wrote that Letter I understood <a id="l667"></a>the Method of fluxions so far as it is comprehended in those six Propositi<a id="l668"></a>ons. When I had finished the book &amp; the 7<sup>th</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> 9<sup>th</sup> &amp; 10<sup>th</sup> Propositions <a id="l669"></a>were fresh in memory I wrote upon them to M<sup>r</sup> I. Collins that Letter <a id="l670"></a>which was dated 8 Novem. 1676, &amp; printed by M<sup>r</sup> Iones. The Theorems <a id="l671"></a>at the end of the tenth Proposition for compoaring curvilinear figures with <a id="l672"></a>the Conic Sections were  known to me when I wrote the said <a id="l673"></a>Letter of 24 Octob 1676, the Ordinates of the  Figures being there set down. <a id="l674"></a>They were copied from the Tract which I wrote in the year 1671. <a id="l675"></a>To understand these two Letters &amp; how to find those Theoremes <a id="l676"></a>requires skill in the Method of fluxions so far as it is compre<a id="l677"></a>hended in all the first ten Propositions of the Book. And the Book conteins <a id="l678"></a>but one Proposition more.</p>

<p id="par47">The first Proposition of this Book  with the solution &amp; examples were printed <a id="l681"></a>almost verbatim in the second Volume of the works of D<sup>r</sup> Wallis A.C. <a id="l682"></a>1692 &amp; came abroad the next year. And thus the Rule for finding <a id="l683"></a>second third &amp; fourth fluxions  was published some  years <a id="l684"></a>before the Rule for finding second third &amp; fourth differences, &amp; was <a id="l685"></a>long before in manuscript. In the Introduction to this Book the <a id="l686"></a>method of fluxions is taught without the use of prickt letters; for <a id="l687"></a>I seldome used prickt letters when I considered only first fluxions: <a id="l688"></a>but when I considered also second third &amp; fourth fluxions I distin<a id="l689"></a>guished them by the number of pricks. And this notation is not only the <a id="l690"></a>oldest but is also the most  expedite tho it was not known <a id="l691"></a>to the Marquess de l'Hospital when he recommended the differen<a id="l692"></a>tial Notation.</p>
<p id="par48">M<sup>r</sup> Collins in his Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Berte  dated 26 Iuly 1672 <a id="l693"></a>wrote thus of what I communicated to D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in the year 1669 &amp; before.  <em class="underline">Mense Septembri 1668 – – – – haud integrum  <a id="l694"></a>ducit</em>. Gregory found the Method of series proprio Marte but did not claim <a id="l695"></a>it because he knew that he was not the first inventor. By the testimony <a id="l696"></a>of  Barrow grounded upon papers communicated to him from time to <a id="l697"></a>time,  M<sup>r</sup> Collins  in this Letter  wrote that it appeared that I had the Method <a id="l698"></a>conteined in the <em class="underline">Analysis per  æquationes numero terminorum infinitas</em> <a id="l699"></a>some years before the Doctor sent this <em class="underline">Analysis</em> to   <a id="l700"></a>part of this Method is to square figures accurately when it may be <a id="l701"></a>done or else by perpetuall approximation: &amp; this requires skill in the method of <a id="l702"></a>fluxions so far at least as it  is conteined in the first six Propositi<a id="l703"></a>ons of the Book of Quadratures as was said above.  Nothing has been said to prove that M<sup>r</sup> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p429r"> &lt;429r&gt; </span> Leibnitz had the method before he came to London the second time. Then <a id="l704"></a>he met with D<sup>r</sup> Barrows Lectures &amp; the Marquess de l'Hospital has <a id="l705"></a>said that where the Doctor left off M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz proceeded,  &amp; that the improve<a id="l706"></a>ment which he made to the Doctors methods  consisted in shewing <a id="l707"></a>how to   exclude fractions &amp; <a id="l708"></a>radicals. But the Marquess did not know that by my Letters of 10 Decem <a id="l709"></a>1672 &amp; 24 Octob 1676  he had notice from me that this improvement was to <a id="l710"></a>be <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">done.</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">made.</span></span> He might afterwards find it proprio Marte, but by that no<a id="l711"></a>tice knew that I had it before him.  For in his letter of 21 Iune 1677 <a id="l712"></a>wherein he   first communicate his Method he  acknowledged that I knew it when I wrote my Letter of 24 Octob. <a id="l713"></a>1676.  And a copy <a id="l726"></a>of my Letter of  10 Decem 1672 was sent to him (amongst Gregories papers) <a id="l727"></a>in Iune preceding. And in the Scholium upon the second Lemma of the second Book of Principles I put him in mind of this in a friendly manner And yet in his Letter of 29 Decem 1711 he  claimed <a id="l728"></a>a right to the method as Inventor &amp; justified what was published in the Acta Eruditorum <a id="l729"></a>for Ianuary  1705, where he is called the Inventor, &amp;  from his being so is drawn <a id="l730"></a>this Conclusion: <em class="underline">Pro differentijs igitur Leibnitianis Newtonus adhibet, semperque</em> <a id="l731"></a>[pro ijsdem] <em class="underline">adhibuit, fluxiones — ijsque tum in Principijs Naturæ Mahtemati<a id="l732"></a>cis, tum in alijs postea editis</em> [pro differentijs illis] <em class="underline">eleganter est usus, <a id="l733"></a>quemadmodum et Honoratus Fabrius in sua Synopsi Geometrica, <a id="l734"></a>motuum progressus Cavallerianæ methodo substituit.</em></p>

And when I had finished it &amp; the 7<sup>th</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> 9<sup>th</sup> &amp; 10<sup>th</sup> Pro<a id="l756"></a>positions were fresh in memory I wrote upon them to M<sup>r</sup> Collins <a id="l757"></a>that Letter which was dated 8 Novem. 1676 &amp; published by M<sup>r</sup> Iones <a id="l758"></a>The Table in the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> Proposition for comparing Curvilinear Areas with the Conic Sections is mentioned in my Letter <a id="l759"></a>of 24 Octob. 1676 &amp; the very words of the first Proposition of the Book are also there set down enigmatically; and the contents of these two Letters require skill <a id="l760"></a>in the whole book   to understand them.</p>
<p id="par52">At the request of D<sup>r</sup> Wallis I sent to him in two Letters dated <a id="l767"></a>27 Aug. &amp; 17 Sept 1692 the first Proposition of the book of Quadra<a id="l768"></a>tures copied almost verbatim from the Book &amp; also the Method <a id="l769"></a>of extracting fluents out of equations involving fluxions mention<a id="l770"></a>ed in my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 &amp; copied from an older paper; <a id="l771"></a>&amp; an explication of the method direct &amp; inverse comprehended in <a id="l772"></a>the sentence Data æquatione quotcunque fluentes quantitates in<a id="l773"></a>volvente invenire fluxiones, &amp; vice versa: &amp; the Doctor printed <a id="l774"></a>them all the same year in the second Volume of his works which <a id="l775"></a>was then in the Press &amp; came abroad the next year (A.C. 1693) <a id="l776"></a>two years before the first Volume was printed off.

<p id="par63">When M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz wrote his Letter  dated 27 Aug. 1676, he <a id="l890"></a>placed the perfection of Analysis  not in the Differential Method but in <a id="l891"></a>another Method founded on Analytical Tables of Tangents &amp; the Combi<a id="l892"></a>natory Art. Nihil est, saith he, – – – – – cogitationum humanarum.  When he was in London the second time viz<sup>t</sup> in October 1676 he <a id="l894"></a>met with D<sup>r</sup> Barrows Lectures, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Iames Bernoulli in a Paper printed <a id="l895"></a>in the Acta Eruditorum for Ianuary 1691 wrote thus: Qui calculum <a id="l896"></a>Barrovianum  (quem decennio ante [i.e. ante editionem Ele<a id="l897"></a>mentorum Calculi Leibnitiani] in Lectionibus suis Geometricis adumbravit <a id="l898"></a>auctor, cujusque specimina sunt tota illa Propositionum inibi contentarum farrago) intellexerit, alterum a <a id="l899"></a>Dn.

The Marquess de l'Hospital, in the Preface to the Analysis <a id="l902"></a>des Infinitement Petits published A.C. 1696, hath told us that the improve <a id="l903"></a>which  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz made to D<sup>r</sup> Barrows Methods consisted in excluding <a id="l904"></a>fractions &amp; surds from the calculation: but he did not then know that <a id="l905"></a>I had given  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz notice of this improvement in my Letters of 10 Decem <a id="l906"></a>1672 &amp; 24 Octob. 1676.</p>

<p id="par65">When the Marquess de l'Hospital wrote his book de infinite <a id="l907"></a>Petites &amp; affirmed that the Differential notation was more conve<a id="l908"></a>nient then mine, he meant my Notation in the second Lemma <a id="l909"></a>of the second Book of Principles: for he had then seen no <a id="l910"></a>other.

The method <a id="l912"></a>of extracting fluents out of Equations involving fluxions I <a id="l913"></a>invented in the end of the year 1671 or beginning of the <a id="l914"></a>year following &amp; at the request of D<sup>r</sup> Wallis sent it to him <a id="l915"></a> Septem. 17 1692 &amp; he inserted it into the second Volume of his <a id="l916"></a>works which were printed the next year  &amp; came abroad <a id="l917"></a>two years after.

However, when <a id="l944"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz by his Letter of 12 May 1676 had put me upon <a id="l945"></a>resuming the consideration of the methods of Series &amp; Fluxions I <a id="l946"></a>wrote the book of Quadratures  (excepting the <a id="l947"></a>Introduction &amp; Conclusion) extracting most of it out of old papers; <a id="l948"></a>&amp; when I had newly finished the tenth Proposition with it's Corol<a id="l949"></a>laries &amp; they were fresh in memory I wrote upon them that <a id="l950"></a>Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Collins which was dated 8 Novem. 1676 &amp; published <a id="l951"></a>by M<sup>r</sup> Iones. The Tables at the end of that Proposition for <a id="l952"></a>squaring of some Curves &amp; comparing others  with the <a id="l953"></a>Conic Sections were invented by the Inverse Method of fluxions <a id="l954"></a>before the year 1671 as may be understood by my Letter of 24 <a id="l955"></a>Octob 1676. And in the same Letter, where I  represented that the gene<a id="l956"></a>rall Theoremes there mentioned for squaring of Curves were <a id="l957"></a>founded on the Method of fluxions, I meant the method described in the first six Propositions of the Book of Quadratures.

And this Volume came abroad in the year 1693 two years before the first Volume was printed off. ① By the inverse method <a id="l968"></a>of fluxions I found in the year 1677 the Demonstration of Kepler's <a id="l969"></a>Astronomical Proposition which is the eleventh Proposition of the  first <a id="l970"></a>Book of Principles, &amp; in the year 1683 at the  importunity of D<sup>r</sup> Halley I <a id="l971"></a>resumed the consideration thereof &amp; added some more Propositions about <a id="l972"></a>the motions of the heavenly bodies which were by him communicated to the R. <a id="l973"></a>Society &amp; entred in their Books the winter following, &amp; upon their request <a id="l974"></a>that things might be published, I wrote the Book of Principles in <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p435r"> &lt;435r&gt; </span> the years 1684, 1685, 1686, &amp; in writing it made much use of the method <a id="l975"></a>of fluxions direct &amp; inverse, but did not set down the calculations in <a id="l976"></a>the Book it self because the Book was written by the Method of <a id="l977"></a>Composition as all Geometry ought to be.

<p id="par68">In the second part of his Postscript he tells you that if all <a id="l993"></a>bodies be heavy gravity must be a scholastick occult quality &amp; a miracle. <a id="l994"></a>notwithstanding that it may be supposed to act constantly by a certain <a id="l995"></a>law imprest by God upon the nature of things; that is to say it must <a id="l996"></a>a miracle tho it be no  miracle. For Miracles are so called <a id="l997"></a>because they happen seldome &amp;  for that reason create wonder. All qua<a id="l998"></a>lities are occult whose causes are not known, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz has not yet told <a id="l999"></a>us the cause of Gravity. But a Scholastick occult quality is that whose cause in <a id="l1000"></a>our opinion cannot be found out because it was unknown to Aristotle, &amp; no <a id="l1001"></a>body can go beyond him. M<sup>r</sup> Newton holds no such opinion, but leaves it <a id="l1002"></a>to  every man to find out the cause of gravity if he can.</p>
<p id="par69">But M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  insinuates that gravity must be caused by <a id="l1003"></a>the action or impulse of  some bodies or subtile matter <a id="l1004"></a> &amp; the matter which causes gravity cannot gravitate it self. He goes <a id="l1005"></a>upon the Hypothesis of the materialists viz that all the phænomena in <a id="l1006"></a>nature are caused by mere matter &amp; motion &amp; man himself is a mere machine <a id="l1007"></a> His body is not actuated by  any mind but moves by <a id="l1008"></a>mere mechanism.  And his zeale for this precarious hypothesis <a id="l1009"></a>makes him rail at M<sup>r</sup> Newton's universal gravity. He denys none of <a id="l1010"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newtons experiments. He denys not this third Rule of Philosophy. And yet <a id="l1011"></a>from  the Experiments &amp; that Rule  universal gravity necessarily <a id="l1012"></a>follows. But he  denys the conclusion. And <a id="l1013"></a>indeed he has a very good faculty at denying conclusions. That third Rule <a id="l1014"></a>is the Rule of Induction. And without it no Proposition can become <a id="l1015"></a>general in Naturall Philosophy. Without it we cannot affirm that <a id="l1016"></a>all bodies are impenetrable. And the argument by Induction for universal gravi<a id="l1017"></a>ty is as strong as the argument for universal impenetrability. Yet <a id="l1018"></a>Arguments from Induction are not Demonstrations. They are only <a id="l1019"></a>to take place till some experimental exception can be found. And if M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l1020"></a>out of  zeale for the Hypothesis of the Materialists will <a id="l1021"></a>except his subtile matter,  the exception will do M<sup>r</sup> Newton's <a id="l1022"></a>Philosophy no harm.  And by theh same liberty any body else may except the Impenetrability of the particles of his subtile matter.</p>
<p id="par70">He saith that God is Intelligentia supramundana because he <a id="l1023"></a>is not the soul of the world &amp; has no need of a Sensorium: as if the  soul of a man would <a id="l1024"></a>be the soul of the pictures of visible objects made in the sensorium <a id="l1025"></a>if it were in the  place where they are made, or as if any man (except the Antho<a id="l1026"></a>pomorphites  ever feigned <a id="l1027"></a>that God had a Sensiorium in a litteral sence. But what he means <a id="l1028"></a>by banishing God out of the  world wants an explication <a id="l1029"></a>Doth he mean that God is beyond  all space: a being that's nusquam, <a id="l1030"></a>And is he angry at M<sup>r</sup> Newton for saying that God is every where. <a id="l1031"></a>&amp; that he is not far from  every one of us: for in him we live <a id="l1032"></a>&amp; move &amp; have our being.</p>
<p id="par71">He saith that he is astonished that M<sup>r</sup> Newton should beleive that God hath made the world so <a id="l1033"></a>ill that  that like a watch it would at length <a id="l1034"></a>cease to go without the extraordinary hand of God;  &amp; that this is to have very narrow <a id="l1035"></a>Ideas of Gods wisdom &amp; power. And by the same Argument any man may  affirm that God was able to <a id="l1036"></a>endow matter with  an active &amp; self moving principle, &amp; enable it to think, &amp; therefore has <a id="l1037"></a>done it because he is wise &amp; good, &amp; that God created the world from all Eternity <a id="l1038"></a>&amp; made it a being absolutely perfect because he was able to do so,  &amp; that to deny <a id="l1039"></a>all this is to have narrow ideas of Gods power &amp; wisdome &amp; goodness.</p>

<p id="par72">He commends experimental Philosophy, but adds that when experiments are <a id="l1040"></a>wanting, it is allowed to imagin Hypotheses, &amp; expect till new experiments shall <a id="l1041"></a>determin which of them are true.  &amp; upon this account  thinks his phi<a id="l1042"></a>losophy may be justified. But he should consider that Hypotheses are nothing <a id="l1043"></a>more then imaginations, conjectures, &amp; suspicions &amp; ought not to be propounded <a id="l1044"></a>as  Truths or Opinions nor admitted into Philosophy as such untill they <a id="l1045"></a>are verified &amp; established by experiments. And if you consider his  <a id="l1046"></a>Philosophy you will find that it consists  generally in such Hypotheses as  <a id="l1047"></a>can never be established by experiments: Such as are That God is <a id="l1048"></a>intelligentia supramundana, that  the bodies of animals are moved not by the mind or will of the animal but mechanically by an Harmonia præstabilita <a id="l1049"></a>that all the Phænomena in Nature are purely mechanical. That <a id="l1050"></a>the world is so perfect that it can last for ever without running <a id="l1051"></a>into disorder, that the Planets revolve in Vortices, That God has never <a id="l1052"></a>intermedled with the frame of things since the first creation.</p>

<p id="par73">It's not impossible but that an exception may be found in time. But  <a id="l1053"></a>a mere hypothesis or supposition of an exception is no exception. The exception <a id="l1054"></a>out to be  experimental. The meaning of  Conclusion <a id="l1055"></a> made by Induction is that they are to be looked upon as general <a id="l1056"></a>till some reall exception appeare.  And in this sense gravity is to be looked upon <a id="l1057"></a>as universal  . To make an exception upon a mere <a id="l1058"></a>Hypothesis is to feign an exception. It is to reject the argument for Induction,  <a id="l1059"></a>&amp; turn Philosophy  into a heap of Hypotheses,  which are no better then a chimerical <a id="l1060"></a>Romance.</p>
