    <p id="par1" class="cent">To the Right Honourable the Lord High Treasurer <a id="l1"></a>of England. <br><br></p>
    
    <p id="par2" class="i0">May it please your Lordship <br><br></p>
    
    <p id="par3">In obedience to your Lordships Reference of 23 November last we 
        <a id="l2"></a>have enquired into the Case of M<sup>r</sup> Antony Redhead late Master &amp; 
        <a id="l3"></a>Worker of the Mint at Norwich &amp; find it truly stated in the annexed 
        <a id="l4"></a>paper on which the said Reference is endorsed. And particularly by the <a id="l5"></a>Daybooks of that Mint &amp; the Cash books of M<sup>r</sup> Redhead &amp; his Clerk and <a id="l6"></a>another book composed &amp; signed by the Warden of that Mint we find <a id="l7"></a>that M<sup>r</sup> Redhead upon the breaking up of that Mint was indebted <a id="l8"></a>2497<sup>li</sup>. 16<sup>s</sup>. 3<sup>d</sup> to M<sup>r</sup>  Blofeld for hammered money at 5<sup>s</sup> per ounce.</p>
    
    <p id="par4">In discharge of this Debt M<sup>r</sup> Redhead produces three Receipts <a id="l9"></a>for 2500<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> paid to M<sup>r</sup> Blofelds Order out of that Mint, the one dated <a id="l10"></a>Aug 26 1697 for 500<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> the other two dated Aug 30 &amp; Sept 1 1697 for 1000<sup>li</sup> <a id="l11"></a>each. To which M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld &amp; his friends answer that whatever summs were paid <a id="l12"></a>to him or his Order out of that Mint upon such private Receipts, were intended <a id="l13"></a>upon the next accounting to be brought to account &amp; set off upon the Printed <a id="l14"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>M<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>int Tickets then payable in course &amp; accordingly were all of them faithfully <a id="l15"></a> brought to account as he is ready to make oath. But the Receipts <a id="l16"></a>were not always taken up &amp; cancelled as they should have been, the <a id="l17"></a>endorsement on the printed Mint Tickets, as they conceived, imploying according <a id="l18"></a>to the order &amp; course of the Mint that all summs paid untill the <a id="l19"></a>day of the endorsement were then accounted for &amp; set off upon the <a id="l20"></a>printed Tickets &amp; thereby all private Receipts of such summs untill <a id="l21"></a>that day discharged &amp; made voyd, which made him &amp; his Agents less <a id="l22"></a>carefull to take them up.  They say also that about three weeks after the date <a id="l23"></a>of the said three Receipts viz<sup>t</sup> on 22<sup>th</sup> Sept 1697  M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld account with <a id="l24"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Redhead &amp; endorsed 14922<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> on two Mint tickets including all <a id="l25"></a>summs paid to him untill that time &amp; that is  so short a time as three weeks so great a summ as 2500<sup>l</sup> could not be forgot &amp; that  in December following <a id="l26"></a>he accounted again &amp; endorsed 6443<sup>li</sup>. 13<sup>s</sup>. 9<sup>d</sup> on two other Mint <a id="l27"></a>Tickets including all further summs paid untill that day. By which <a id="l28"></a>Accountings &amp; Endorsements the said three Receipts (if they be true <a id="l29"></a>ones) being   looked upon as discharged they were not mentioned any <a id="l30"></a>further by M<sup>r</sup> Redhead while that Mint stood nor for a long time <a id="l31"></a>after but lay neglected till he thought fit to produce them, as he did <a id="l32"></a>also some other Receipts of the same kind which the Importers neglected <a id="l33"></a>to take up &amp; cancell, &amp; which  are no allowed to be voyd. </p>
    
    <p id="par5">In examining this matter we find therefore that <sup>†</sup>
        
        
        
       
M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld did <a id="l34"></a>endorse 14922<sup>li</sup> on two Tickets 22 Sept 1697 &amp; 6443<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> 13<sup>s</sup> 9<sup>d</sup> mroe on two <a id="l35"></a>others in December following as is alleged &amp;

        <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p483v"> &lt;483v&gt; </span>
        
        representing that he then found them amongst his papers.  <a id="l37"></a>About the same time he found also &amp; produced  a Receipt of 1858<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> left in that <a id="l38"></a>Mint by M<sup>r</sup> Dashwood another Importer of publick money, but by <a id="l39"></a>an Affidavit of M<sup>r</sup> Tho. Allen Clerk to the Warden of that Mint <a id="l40"></a>made before my Lord Chief Baron Ward on the 3<sup>d</sup> of Iuly 1701 &amp; by other <a id="l41"></a>circumstances it appears to us that M<sup>r</sup> Dashwood did account for <a id="l42"></a>that money &amp; neglect to take up &amp; cancell the Receipt,  &amp; this is now acknowledged also by M<sup>r</sup> Redhead.  <a id="l44"></a>About the same time he the said M<sup>r</sup> Redhead produced also <a id="l45"></a>two other Receipts of the aforesaid M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld besides the three above menti<a id="l46"></a>oned both dated in the same month of August 1697 the one <a id="l47"></a>for 500<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> &amp; the other for 1000<sup>li</sup>, but by the aforesaid Affi<a id="l48"></a>davit of <sup>r</sup> Allen these summs were accounted for upon the <a id="l49"></a>same 22<sup>th</sup> of Sept. 1697 &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Redhead insists no further upon <a id="l50"></a>them. And the said M<sup>r</sup> Allen in the same Affidavit affirms <a id="l51"></a>further that he hath heard &amp; believes that M<sup>r</sup> Redhead hath <a id="l52"></a>another Note of M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld for 1000<sup>li</sup> &amp; believes that M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld <a id="l53"></a>forgot to take up that Note when he accompted for the money &amp; <a id="l54"></a>signed the printed Receipt or Ticket : which Note we take <a id="l55"></a>to be one of the three Receipts now produced by M<sup>r</sup> Redhead.   
        And M<sup>r</sup> Redhead himself affirms nothing further of the said three <a id="l61"></a>Receipts then that he found them amongst his papers sometime after <a id="l62"></a>that Mint broke up &amp; believes them to be truly signed by one M<sup>r</sup> Crowne <a id="l63"></a> who was impoyed by M<sup>r</sup> Demee the Agent of M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld <a id="l64"></a> 
        They are in the form of private <a id="l67"></a>receipts so that without M<sup>r</sup> Blofelds consent they cannot be allowed by the <a id="l68"></a>Auditors  eitehr in M<sup>r</sup> Redheads Account or in that of M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld which is now passing. And all things being considered we are
        <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 848r &gt; </span>humbly of opinion that they have already been accompted for &amp; ought not to be <a id="l69"></a>insisted upon any further &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Redhead  <a id="l70"></a>himself does not any loger insist peremptorily upon them but submits them to <a id="l71"></a>your Lordships wisdome.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 483v resumes &gt; </span></p>
    
    <p id="par6">We further lay before your Lordship that M<sup>r</sup> Redhead at the <a id="l72"></a>conclusion of the Mint at Norwich was indebted to one M<sup>r</sup> Chaplain <a id="l73"></a>a Receiver of the Land Tax for 2573<sup>oz</sup>. 5<sup>dwt</sup> of hammered money <a id="l74"></a>at 5<sup>s</sup> per ounce the summ of 642<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup>. 6<sup>s</sup>. 3<sup>d</sup>, &amp; that in M<sup>r</sup> Chaplains Accompt <a id="l75"></a>which is past &amp; declared &amp; Quietus obteined, M<sup>r</sup> Redhead is set insuper <a id="l76"></a>for this debt at 5<sup>s</sup> 8<sup>d</sup> per ounce. </p>
    
    <p id="par7">The said M<sup>r</sup> Redhead was also indebted to M<sup>r</sup> Briggs a Receiver <a id="l79"></a>of <span class="hspac-n" title="16 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> for 3529<sup>oz</sup> 10<sup>dwt</sup> of hammered money at 5<sup>s</sup> per <a id="l80"></a>ounce the summ of 882<sup>li</sup>. 7<sup>s</sup>. 6<sup>d</sup>. But the Administrators of the said <a id="l81"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Briggs have passed his Accompts &amp; obteined a Quietus without <a id="l82"></a>charging M<sup>r</sup> Redhead with this debt &amp; thence it is presumed that they haev either mislaid or lost <a id="l83"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Redheads Tickets, &amp; thereby have been dammaged in the said summ 882<sup>li</sup>. 7<sup>s</sup>. 6<sup>d</sup></p>

<p id="par12" class="i0">seeing therefore that M<sup>r</sup> Bl upon accounting 22 Sept 97  did neglect to take <a id="l92"></a>up some of his  receipts then accounted for, it may be suspected that  <a id="l93"></a> he neglected to take up the rest amongst which are <a id="l94"></a>the three now produced.

    <p id="par25">In obedience to your Lordships Reference of 23 November last we have <a id="l160"></a>enquiredinto the Case of M<sup>r</sup> Antony Redhead late Master &amp; Worker of the <a id="l161"></a>Mint at Norwich &amp; find it truly stated in the annexed paper on which the <a id="l162"></a>said Reference is endorsed. And particularly we  the Day-books on that Mint <a id="l163"></a>&amp; the Cashbooks of M<sup>r</sup> Redhead &amp; his Clerk &amp; another book composed and <a id="l164"></a>signed by the Warden of that Mint we find that M<sup>r</sup> Redhead upon the breaking <a id="l165"></a>up of that Mint was indebted 2497<sup>li</sup>. 16<sup>s</sup>. 3<sup>d</sup> to M<sup>r</sup> Leonard Blofeld for ham<a id="l166"></a>mered money at 5<sup>s</sup> per ounce.</p>
    
    <p id="par26">In discharge of this debt M<sup>r</sup> Redhead produces three Receipts for 2500<sup>li</sup> 
        <a id="l167"></a>paid to M<sup>r</sup> Blofelds Order out of that Mint, the one dated Aug. 26 1697 for 500<sup>li</sup> 
        <a id="l168"></a>the other two dated Aug 30 &amp; Sept. 1 1697 for 1000<sup>li</sup> each. To which 
        <a id="l169"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld &amp; his friends answer that whatever summs were paid to him 
        <a id="l170"></a>or his Order out of that Mint upon such private Receipts were paid in course for silver imported &amp; intended upon 
        <a id="l171"></a>the next accounting to be brought to account &amp; set off upon the printed Mint 
        <a id="l172"></a>Tickets then payable in course &amp; accordingly were all of them faithfully 
        <a id="l173"></a>brought to account as he is ready to make oath: but the Receipts were 
        <a id="l174"></a>not always taken up &amp; cancelled as they should have been the endorsment 
        <a id="l175"></a>on the printed Mint Tickets, as they conceived, implying according to the order 
        <a id="l176"></a>&amp; course of the Mint that all summs paid untill the day of the endors<a id="l177"></a>ment were then accounted for &amp; set off upon the printed Tickets &amp; there<a id="l178"></a>by all private Receipts of such summs untill that day discharged and 
        <a id="l179"></a>made voyd which made him &amp; his Agents less carefull to take them up. 
        <a id="l180"></a>They say also that about three weeks after the date of the said three 
        <a id="l181"></a>Receipts viz<sup>t</sup> on 22<sup>th</sup> Sept 1697 M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld accounted with M<sup>r</sup> Redhead 
        <a id="l182"></a>&amp; endorsed 14922<sup>li</sup> on two Mint Tickets  including all 
        <a id="l183"></a>summs paid to him untill that time &amp; that in so short a time as three 
        <a id="l184"></a>weeks so great a summ as 2500 could not be forgot, &amp; that in December 
        <a id="l185"></a>following he accounted again &amp; endorsed 6443<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup>. 13<sup>s</sup>. 9<sup>d</sup> on two other Mint 
        <a id="l186"></a>Tickets including all further summs untill that day: By which Accountings 
        <a id="l187"></a>&amp; endorsements the said three Receipts (if they be true ones) being 
        <a id="l188"></a>looked upon as discharged they were not mentioned any further by 
        <a id="l189"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Redhead while that Mint stood nor for a long time after but 
        <a id="l190"></a>lay neglected till he thought fitt to produce them, as he did also some 
        <a id="l191"></a>other Receipts of the same kind which the Importers neglected to take 
        <a id="l192"></a>up &amp; cancel &amp; which are now allowed to be voyd.</p>
    
    <p id="par27">In examining this matter we find therefore that M<sup>r</sup> Redhead 
        <a id="l193"></a>did pay several summs of money to M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld &amp; some other Importers 
        <a id="l194"></a>upon private Receipts without endorsing the summs upon the printed Mint 
        <a id="l195"></a>Tickets untill they came to a general recconing upon the Ticket or Tickets 
        <a id="l196"></a>next payable in course, &amp; that the Importers did sometimes upon such a 
        <a id="l197"></a>recconing neglect to take up their Receipts. That M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld did endorse 14922<sup>li</sup>

        <a id="l198"></a>following as he alledged &amp; we humbly conceive those endorsements by the cou<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>rse<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> 
        <a id="l199"></a>of the Mint to be in full of all moneys paid upon those Tickets so as to 
        <a id="l200"></a>voyd the said three Receipts unless M<sup>r</sup> Redhead can positively prove the 
        <a id="l201"></a>payment of more money by 2500<sup>li</sup> upon the two first of those Tickets 
        <a id="l202"></a>then was Endorsed upon them, which proof is wanting &amp; would infer the cri<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>me<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> 
        <a id="l203"></a>of undue preference. The Officers of that Mint for preventing mis<a id="l204"></a>recconings took an account every two or three days &amp; sometimes dayly of 
        <a id="l205"></a>all the monies new coyned &amp; paid away &amp; of what remained in the 
        <a id="l206"></a>Treasury, whereby a misrecconing of 2500<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> might soon have been 
        <a id="l207"></a>discovered: whereas those three Receipts lay neglected till about Michael<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>mas<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> 
        <a id="l208"></a>1699  which was two years after the endorsement, M<sup>r</sup> Redhead repre<a id="l209"></a>senting that he then found the amongst his paper. About the same <a id="l210"></a>time he found also and produced a Receipt of 1858<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> left in that 
        <a id="l211"></a>Mint by M<sup>r</sup> Dashwood another  Importer of publick Hammered 
        <a id="l212"></a>money; but by an Affidavit of M<sup>r</sup> Tho Allen Clerk to the Warden 
        <a id="l213"></a>of that Mint made before my Lord Chief Baron Ward the 3<sup>d</sup> of Iuly 
        <a id="l214"></a>1701 &amp; by other circumstances it appears to us that M<sup>r</sup> Dashwood did 
        <a id="l215"></a>account for that money &amp; neglect to take up &amp; cancel the Receipt 
        <a id="l216"></a>&amp; this is now acknowledged also by M<sup>r</sup> Redhead. Add about the same time 
        <a id="l217"></a>the said M<sup>r</sup> Redhead produced also two other Receipts of the aforesa<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>id<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> 
        <a id="l218"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld besides the three above mentioned both dated in the same 
        <a id="l219"></a>month of August 1697 the one for 500<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> the other for 1000<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup>, but 
        <a id="l220"></a>by the aforesaid Affidavit of M<sup>r</sup> Allen these summs were accounted 
        <a id="l221"></a>for upon the same 22<sup>th</sup> of Sept. 1697 &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Redhead insists no
        <a id="l222"></a>further upon them. Seeing therefore that M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld upon accounting 
        <a id="l223"></a>22<sup>th</sup> Sept 1697 did neglect to take up &amp; cancel some of his Receipts then 
        <a id="l224"></a>accounted for, it may be suspected that he neglected to take up the rest <a id="l225"></a>amongst which are the three now produced. For the said M<sup>r</sup> Allen in 
        <a id="l226"></a>the Affidavit above mentioned affirms further that he hath heard &amp; 
        <a id="l227"></a>believes that  M<sup>r</sup> Redhead hath another Note of M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld for 1000<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> &amp; 
            <a id="l228"></a>believes that M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld forgot to take up that Note when he accompted 
            <a id="l229"></a>for the money &amp; signed the printed Receipt or Ticket: which Note we 
            <a id="l230"></a>take to be one of the three Receipts now produced by M<sup>r</sup> Redhead. And 
        <a id="l231"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Redhead himself affirms nothing further of the said three Receipts then 
        <a id="l232"></a>that he found them amongst his papers sometime after that Mint broke up 
        <a id="l233"></a>&amp; believes them to be truely signed by M<sup>r</sup> Crowne who was imployed by 
        <a id="l234"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Demee the Agent of M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld. They are in the form of private <a id="l235"></a>Receipts so that without M<sup>r</sup> Blofelds consent they cannot be allowed by <a id="l236"></a>an Auditor either in M<sup>r</sup> Redheads Accompt or in that of M<sup>r</sup> Blofeld which <a id="l237"></a>is now passing. All things being considered we are humbly of opinion that <a id="l238"></a>they have already been accompted for &amp; ought not to be insisted upon a <a id="l239"></a>further. And M<sup>r</sup> Redhead himself does not any longer insist peremptorily <a id="l240"></a>upon them but submits them to your Lordships wisdome.</p>
    
    <p id="par28">We further lay before your Lordship that M<sup>r</sup> Redhead at the conclusion of <a id="l241"></a>the Mint at Norwich was indebted to one M<sup>r</sup> Chaplain a Receiver of the <a id="l242"></a>Land Tax for 2573<sup>oz</sup> 5<sup>dwt</sup> of hammered money at 5<sup>s</sup> per ounce the summ of <a id="l243"></a>643<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup>. 6<sup>s</sup>. 3<sup>d</sup>, &amp; that in  M<sup>r</sup> Chaplains Accompt which is past &amp; declared &amp;
