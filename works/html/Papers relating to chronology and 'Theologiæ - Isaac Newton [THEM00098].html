And  the Amphictyons in their war against Cyrrha  by the  advice of Solon made this Alcmæon &amp; Clisthenes king <a id="l7"></a>&amp; Sicyon &amp; Eurolycus king of Thessaly commanders of their <a id="l8"></a>army.  And the Cyrrhæans were conquered Ann. 2 Olymp. <a id="l9"></a>47 according to the Marbles.  Megacles the son of this  Alcmæon <a id="l10"></a>Married Agarista the daughter of Clisthenes, &amp; by her had <a id="l11"></a>Clisthenes II &amp; a little before the tyranny of Pisistratus <a id="l12"></a>he &amp; Pisistratus &amp; Lycurgus commanded the three factions <a id="l13"></a>into which the Athenians were then divided.   When Pisistratus <a id="l14"></a>obteined the tyranny (viz<sup>t</sup> an 4 Olymp. 54)  Megacles &amp; his <a id="l15"></a>friends were banished but soon after ejected Pisistratus <a id="l16"></a>&amp; five years after  restored him &amp; gave him his daughter <a id="l18"></a>but a while after  ejected him again.  Afterwards Pisistratus <a id="l19"></a>recovered the tyranny again &amp; after the death of Megacles <a id="l20"></a>&amp; Pisistratus his sons were  ejected by Clisthenes the son of Megacles &amp; Agarista. <a id="l21"></a>an 1 Olymp 67, anno Darij 10<sup>mo</sup>.</p>

<p id="par2">The Amphictyons by the advice of Solon made Alcmæon the son of <a id="l22"></a>Megacles an Athenian &amp; Clsithenes king of Sicyon &amp; Eurolycus king <a id="l23"></a>of Thessaly commanders of their army in their war against Cyrrha <a id="l24"></a>&amp; the Cyrrhæans were conquered an 2 Olymp 47 according to the <a id="l25"></a>Marbles.  This Alcmæon entertained &amp; conducted the Messengers which <a id="l26"></a>Crœsus sent to consult the Oracle at Delphos &amp; for doing so was sent for <a id="l27"></a> by Crœsus &amp; rewarded with much riches.   Clisthenes  <a id="l28"></a>proclaiming that he would marry his daughter Agarista within a year to <a id="l29"></a>the most deserving, there came to court her Megacles the son of this <a id="l30"></a>Alcmæon, &amp; Leocides the son of Phidon the Argive &amp; several others &amp; Clisthenes <a id="l31"></a>gave his daughter to Megacles.  This was that Phidon king of Argos who <a id="l32"></a>appointed  weights &amp; measures &amp; coined silver money in Ægina, &amp; invading Clis presided in the Olympiads, as Herodotus sufficiently describes.   Phidon therefore was  contemporary to  Alcmæon both of them to Clisthenes &amp; Solon &amp; their sons Megacles  &amp; Leocides were contemporary to one another &amp; to Pisistratus.  ffor  Megacles, Pisistratus &amp; Lycurgus commanded the <a id="l36"></a>three factions into which the Athenians were divided a little before the tyranny of <a id="l37"></a>Pisistratus &amp; when Pisistratus obteined the tyrrany he married the daughter <a id="l38"></a>of Megacles &amp; he &amp; Megacles ejected one another by turns &amp; at length <a id="l39"></a>Clisthenes the son of Megacles &amp; Agarista expelled the  sons of Pisistratus An 1 <a id="l40"></a>Olymp 67 according to the Marble.  So then Phidon flourished in the 47<sup>th</sup> <a id="l41"></a>Olympiad, that is about 70 years before the  death of Cyrus or 240 <a id="l42"></a>years after  the return of the Heraclides:  [&amp; in this <a id="l43"></a>time there were 10 generations from Temenus to Phidon inclusively, or <a id="l44"></a>nine intervals, which is a reasonable proportion being after the rate of about 28 years to an  <a id="l45"></a>interval or generation.

<p id="par7">In the race of the Spartan <a id="l143"></a>kings descended from Eurythenes after   Polydorus reigned these kings Eurycrates I, <a id="l144"></a>Anaxander, Eurycrates II, Leon, Anaxandrides fil, Cleomenes fil, Leonides frat, &amp; <a id="l145"></a> in the other race after Theopompus reigned Zeuxidamus, Anaxidamus, Archidamus, Agasicles <a id="l146"></a>Ariston Demaratus Leotychides.   Polycrates king of Samus <a id="l153"></a>being slain about the 7<sup>th</sup> year of Cambyses was succeeded by Mæan<a id="l154"></a>drius  &amp; Darius Hystaspis in or neare the beginning of this reign  invading Samus <a id="l155"></a>Mæandrius fled to Cleomexes king of Sparta (Herod l. 3 prope finem) <a id="l156"></a> Some years after when  Darius proposed to conquer Greece he sent <a id="l157"></a>messengers to all Greece to demand  earth &amp; water &amp; the Islands <a id="l158"></a>submitted &amp; amongst the rest Ægina.  Whereupon Cleomenes king <a id="l159"></a>of Sparta to whom that Island belonged sailed to Ægina to com<a id="l160"></a>prehend the persons offending as if they  revolted to the <a id="l161"></a>Persians,  &amp; in his absence was accused by Demaratus  the <a id="l162"></a>other king of Sparta, but upon his return caused Demaratus to <a id="l163"></a>be deposed as a bastard, &amp; Leotychides to succeed him &amp; then <a id="l164"></a>about 3 or 4 years after slew himself &amp; was succeeded by his <a id="l165"></a>brother Leonidas who was slain by the Persians at Thermopylæ <a id="l166"></a>in the sixt year of Xerxes,  at which time Demaratus was alive being <a id="l169"></a>fled to the Persians. Vpon the death of Cleomines a war broke out between the Athenians &amp; inhabitants of Ægina &amp; the Athenians by the advice of Themistocles built ships as well against an expected invasion of the Persians as against the people of Ægina By all which it seems to me that Cleomenes <a id="l170"></a>began his reign about the same time with Darius or within 2 or 3 years after &amp;  reigned till <a id="l171"></a>about the  28<sup>th</sup> or <span class="hspac-n" title="Space left blank."></span> year of that king &amp; that Demaratus was deposed <a id="l172"></a>about the 29<sup>th</sup> year of Darius &amp; lived above 18 years longer. <a id="l173"></a>So then between the  end  of the first Messenian war &amp; <a id="l174"></a>the reign of Darius there were about five reigns in both races <a id="l175"></a>of the kings of Sparta which at 20 years apiece one reign <a id="l176"></a>with another make the space of about an hundred years.

He was the Lawmaker of Crete &amp; was so famous for justice <a id="l304"></a>as to be accounted the principall judge of  Hel &amp; justice was the <a id="l305"></a>distinguishing character of Iupiter.  Minos was a great warrior &amp; <a id="l306"></a>the most potent of all the Greeks of his age &amp; had the dominion of  the seas &amp; was the first of the Greeks <a id="l307"></a>who had that dominion &amp; Iupiter was the greatest of all the <a id="l308"></a>Gods &amp; had a scepter in one hand &amp; a thunderbolt in the other <a id="l309"></a>to shew that he was a warlike king.  [Asterius was grown up <a id="l310"></a>&amp; began to reign before Europa &amp; the Phenicians came into Crete &amp;] <a id="l311"></a>Minos was the first king of Crete who could be educated by <a id="l312"></a>the Curetes.  He was born soon after they came  into that <a id="l313"></a>Island &amp; its probable that his mother being a Phœnician would <a id="l314"></a>commit the care &amp; education of her child to her countrymen.  <a id="l315"></a>Mount Ida was  excavated throughout by art with walks &amp; many winding <a id="l316"></a>intricate passages which they called the Labyrinth.  There the Idæi <a id="l317"></a>Dactyli  &amp; their weomen might educate the child. There they <a id="l318"></a>might find out minerals &amp;  make armour first of copper &amp; then <a id="l319"></a>of iron &amp; by the help of this armour after Minos was grown up overcome <a id="l320"></a>the native Cretans  expell Asterius &amp; set Minos upon the throne. <a id="l321"></a>&amp; in memory of these things institute their mysteries &amp; compose the fable of <a id="l322"></a>Iupiter's education &amp; of his expelling his father by the assistance of the <a id="l323"></a>Curetes.

Cicero in numbering three Iupi<a id="l331"></a>ters saith that the third was the Cretan Iupiter Saturns son whose sepulchre was shown in Crete, &amp; the Scholiast <a id="l332"></a>upon Callimachus [Ode 1 in Iovem v. 8] lets us know that this was the Sepulchre of <a id="l333"></a>Minos.

<p id="par30">Ægypt like other nations being at first divided into many little kingdoms <a id="l521"></a>&amp; those kingdoms growing bigger &amp; bigger till they  all united  into one <a id="l522"></a>monarchy, the  chief kingdoms which flourished next before the rise of that monarchy (suppose  <a id="l523"></a>in the days of Eli &amp; the Iudges seem to have been  those of Misraim Thebes &amp; Coptus,  that is the lower Ægypt called Mizraim from the old  capital Mizraim as <a id="l525"></a>above &amp; Aeria from the capital of the shepherds Abaris or Αὀυαρις; Thebes with its <a id="l526"></a>territory called  Æthiopia  [Αἰα Θήβων] by Homer: &amp; Coptus with its <a id="l527"></a>territory called  Αἰα Κόπτου   whence comes the name of Egypt.  </p>
<p id="par31">And these three spake different  languages originally, the language of Thebes being <a id="l536"></a>Æthiopic, that of  Coptus the Coptic  <a id="l537"></a>&amp; that of the lower Egypt a dialect of the shepherds.  But the Coptic prevailed &amp; became <a id="l538"></a>the language of all Egypt till the times of the Greek &amp; Latine Empires &amp; therefore <a id="l539"></a>the kings of Coptus conquered all Egypt.  They first conquered Thebes &amp; thereby <a id="l540"></a>extended the name of  Ægypt to  all The<a id="l541"></a>bais,  &amp; then by expelling the shepherds they extended the same name <a id="l542"></a>to all  the lower Egypt.  For Herodotus tells us that Thebais was anciently <a id="l543"></a>called Ægypt &amp; therefore this name was given to all the upper parts of Egypt before <a id="l544"></a>it was given to the lower.  When the Coptites conquered Thebes they might <a id="l545"></a>also conquer This &amp; Elephantis unless those cities were conquered before by <a id="l546"></a> Thebes.  But there is no distinct account now remaining of the actions &amp; fate of those <a id="l547"></a>kingdoms.  Mephramathosis or his predecessors reduced all the upper Ægypt <a id="l548"></a>into one kingdom.  He &amp; his successor Amosis expelled the shepherds, <a id="l549"></a>Ammon &amp; Sesac extended the monarchy westward to the lesser Syrtes &amp; even to the mouth of the <a id="l550"></a>straits, southward  in to Æthiopia  above the Cataracts &amp; to Arabia felix <a id="l551"></a>eastward into India &amp; northward to Caucasus the black sea &amp; Thrace.</p>

The city is said to have been built by Semiramis the widdow of the first king of Assyria a woman five generations  older then Nitocris the widdow of Nebuchadnezzar.

<p id="par58">Of all the kings of the Medes Cyaxeres was the greatest warrior.  <a id="l772"></a>Herodotus tells us<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> that he was much more warlike then his ancestors &amp; that <a id="l773"></a>he was the first who reduced the irregular &amp; undisciplined forces of the <a id="l774"></a>Medes into discipline &amp; order &amp; divided the kingdom into Provinces, which is as <a id="l775"></a>much as to say that he was the first who by conquering made the kingdom <a id="l776"></a>big enough to be divided into Provinces.   Æschylus who flourished <a id="l777"></a>in the reign of Darius Hystaspis &amp; died in the reign of Xerxes &amp; is the oldest <a id="l778"></a>Greek author who mentions these things, introduces this Darius reciting <a id="l779"></a>his ancestors the kings of the Medo-Persian Monarchy in this order.</p>

<p id="par59" class="i0">Whence it appears that before the reign of Cyrus there were but two kings in <a id="l780"></a>the Empire of the Medes &amp; Persians &amp; those were both Medes, the second <a id="l781"></a>being the son of the first.   And who those were is discovered by Daniel who <a id="l782"></a>lets us know that Darius the son of Ahsuerus  of the seed of the <a id="l783"></a>Medes reigned over Babylon before Cyrus.  For this Darius reigned  by <a id="l784"></a>the laws of the Medes &amp; Persians (Dan 6 <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) &amp; therefore he reigned <a id="l785"></a>over the Medes &amp; Persians as well as over Babylon, &amp; the Medes being <a id="l786"></a>set first, were uppermost in his reign.  You may know also by the <a id="l787"></a>number of Provinces in his kingdom that he reigned over all these nations.  For <a id="l788"></a>he set over the whole kingdom 120 Princes &amp; afterwards in the reign of  <a id="l789"></a>Ahsuerus (that Ahsuerus whom the Greeks call Xerxes,) when the Provinces of Egypt <a id="l790"></a>Thebais &amp; Libya were added to the kingdom, the whole conteined but 127 Pro<a id="l791"></a>vinces.  So then Darius reigned over the Empire of the Medes Persians &amp; Ba<a id="l792"></a>bylonians before Cyrus &amp; by consequence his father Ahsuerus  was the first <a id="l793"></a>king of this Empire.  He first led the army  expelling the <a id="l794"></a>Scythians who had invaded his kingdom &amp; conquering the Assyrians &amp; Persians eastward &amp; Armenians westward <a id="l795"></a>as far as the river Halys &amp; his son Darius finished the work by subduing the <a id="l796"></a>kingdoms of the Lydians &amp; Babylonians.</p>

Diodo<a id="l822"></a>rus L. 1. p 59. Plutarch de Iside p. 354.   And accordingly Alexis  tells <a id="l823"></a>us that Boccharis &amp; his father Neochabis used a moderate diet.  (Apud Athenæum <a id="l824"></a>Dipn. l 10. p. 418e.) Boccharis was  a little man of an infirm body but for prudence &amp; justice <a id="l825"></a>he was famous to a proverb.  He was very  piercing &amp; quicksignted in judgment <a id="l826"></a>&amp; is recconed  amongst  the lawmakers of Egypt.

By which means  he raised them  much higher then Sesostris had done before.  These two kings Anysis &amp; Sabacus are by Diodorus called Amotis &amp; Actisanes.  Amosis   was cruel &amp; put many <a id="l839"></a>to death for which reason his subjects  upon the invasion of Actisanes revolted <a id="l840"></a>from him so that he was easily conquered.

<p id="par66">While the kings of Egypt isntead of imploying their wealth &amp; people <a id="l844"></a>in their wars abroad imployed them at home in building Pyramids,  the Egyptians by degrees lost <a id="l845"></a>their dominion abroad  &amp; became divided at home into severall <a id="l846"></a>kingdoms untill Sabacon  invaded them.  ffor there reigned at Thebes  <a id="l847"></a>Gnephachthus &amp; his son Bocharis.  at Sais  Stephanates, Nechepsos <a id="l849"></a>&amp; Nechus successively &amp;  at Tanis &amp; Pelusium Anytis </p>

<p id="par72">These various kingdoms are  pointed at by Isaiah where he saith I willl <a id="l883"></a>set the Egyptians against the Egyptians &amp; they shall fight every one against <a id="l884"></a>his brother &amp; every one against his neighbour city against city &amp; kingdom against <a id="l885"></a>kingdom – And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord <a id="l886"></a>&amp; a fierce king shall rule over them. – The princes of Zoan are fools <a id="l887"></a>– how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of ancient kings – The Princes of <a id="l888"></a>Noph are deceived. they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of <a id="l889"></a>the Tribes thererof.

<p id="par81">Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> in giving an account of the ancient state of <a id="l922"></a>Egypt tells us that the Priests of Egypt affirming Menes to be their <a id="l923"></a>first king, read to him out of a Book the names of 330 following <a id="l924"></a>kings of Egypt who all reigned before Sesostris, &amp; amongst whom <a id="l925"></a>were 18 Ethiopians &amp; a forreign woman named Nitocris who ac<a id="l926"></a>quired the kingdom by a memorable revenge of her brothers death, &amp; <a id="l927"></a>that the Priests affirmed nothing done by any of the rest except <a id="l928"></a>one who was the last of them &amp; was called Mæris.  But Mæris as <a id="l929"></a>we shall presently shew reigned after Sesostris, &amp; so did Nitocris <a id="l930"></a>if she reigned over both Egypt &amp; Ethiopia as Iosephus mentions <a id="l931"></a>&amp; built the third Pyramid at Memphis as affirmed by Manetho. <a id="l932"></a>Herodotus therefore justly passes over in a few words all the ages <a id="l933"></a>of Egypt before Sesostris as obscure &amp; conteining nothing me<a id="l934"></a>morable, &amp; begins his history of the kings of Egypt with this king <a id="l935"></a>the former kings (except two or three of his immediate pre<a id="l936"></a>decessors) reigning not over all Egypt successively but divers of <a id="l937"></a>them at once in several parts of Egypt, which renders them the <a id="l938"></a>less memorable.  In the time of the Monarchy of Egypt He<a id="l939"></a>rodotus who has given the best account of this kingdom sets down <a id="l940"></a>their kings in this order, if Memnon &amp; Mœris be duly inserted.  <a id="l941"></a>Sesostris, Pheron, [Memnon &amp; his Viceroy] Proteus, Rhampsinitus, <a id="l942"></a>[Mœris,] Cheops, Cephren, Mycerinus, Asychis, Anysis, Sabba<a id="l943"></a>chus the Ethiopian, Anysis again, Sethon Priest of Vulcan, <a id="l944"></a>Twelve contemporary kings, Psammiticus, Necho, Psammis, Apries, <a id="l945"></a>Amasis, Psammenitus.  Before Sesostris is to be placed his father Belus or Ammon, &amp; before Ammon may be set Tethmosis Thmosis or <a id="l946"></a>Amosis the successor of Misphragmuthosis &amp; founder of the E<a id="l947"></a>gyptian Monarchy</p>
<p id="par82">Iosephus<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> tells us out of Manetho that after the Shepherds <a id="l948"></a>went out of Egypt into Iudea, Tethmois or Thummosis who expelled them reigned <a id="l949"></a>25 years &amp; 4 months &amp; then was succeeded by his son Chebron, <a id="l950"></a>after whom reigned Amenothis with his sister.  Then returning back  <a id="l951"></a>he names  Mephres, Mephramuthosis , Thmosis ,  Amenophis &amp; Orus  as reigning in order <a id="l952"></a>  with some other Princes of Egypt contemporary to Orus, one of which was Armais or Danaus.  And then again returning back he names Armesses Miamun &amp; <a id="l954"></a> his son &amp; successor Amenophis &amp; his son &amp; successor <a id="l955"></a>Sethosis the brother of Armais or Danaus.  The same <a id="l956"></a>kings are recited out of Manetho by Africanus &amp; Eusebius <a id="l957"></a>with a little variation of the names as  in the following <a id="l958"></a>Table</p>

<p id="par83" class="i0">Manetho in his 11<sup>th</sup> &amp; 12 Dynasties as he is cited by Africanus &amp; Eusebius  names these kings of Thebes  as reigning in order <a id="l959"></a>Ammenemes,  Gesongoses his son, Ammenemes  ab Euneuchis suis sublatus &amp; <a id="l960"></a> Sesostris.  Gesongoses is by Eusebius called Sesonchoris <a id="l961"></a> The word should be Sesonchosis.

<p id="par84">So again  Manetho in his 18 Dynasty  naming   the kings  which reigned  at Thebes from the expulsion of the Shepherds down to Orus repeats the same kings <a id="l968"></a>several times.   ffirst he tells us that after the shepherds went out of <a id="l969"></a>Egypt into Iudea Tethmosis who expelled them reigned 25 years &amp; 4 months <a id="l970"></a>&amp; then was succeeded by his son Chebron, after whom reigned Amenophis &amp; <a id="l971"></a>his sister.

These kings are <a id="l976"></a>recited out of Manetho by Iosephus, Africanus &amp; Eusebius with a little variation <a id="l977"></a>of the names as in the following Table.</p>
<p id="par85">From him the city Thebes was called No-Ammon &amp; the Ox there worshipped was  called Mnevis</p>

<p id="par88">To him the city No-Ammon  &amp; the Ox Mnevis  were dedicated.</p>


<p id="par91"> As Osiris built temples  in Thebes to his father Ammon  who had reigned in that city before  him, so the Egyptians dedicated <a id="l984"></a>the city it self to Ammon calling it No-Ammon &amp; Ammon-No that is the city <a id="l985"></a>of Ammon, or as the Greeks render the word, Diospolis, the city of Iupiter <a id="l986"></a> Ammon.

<p id="par114">Alexander the Great died at Babylon in  May a month before the summer solstice in the year of Nabonassar 425 <a id="l1118"></a>an 1 Olymp. 114, &amp; his captains gave the Monarchy to his bastard brother <a id="l1119"></a>Philip Aridæus  a man disturbed in his understanding &amp; made Perdiccas <a id="l1120"></a>administrator of the kingdom, &amp; Perdiccas with their consent made Meleager commander of <a id="l1121"></a>the army, Seleucus master of the horse, Craterus Treasurer of the kingdom, <a id="l1122"></a>Antipater governor of Macedon &amp; Greece, Ptolomy governor of Egypt Antigonus  governor of Pamphilia Lycia Lycaonia &amp; Phrygia major &amp; the other captains governors of other Provinces.  And the Babylonians began <a id="l1123"></a>now to count by a new aera which they called the Æra of Philip &amp; used it <a id="l1124"></a>instead of the Æra of Nabonassar recconing the 425 year of Nabonassar <a id="l1125"></a>to be the first year of Philip.  And Roxane the wife of Alexander being <a id="l1126"></a>left big with child &amp; about 3 or 4 months after his death brought to <a id="l1127"></a>bed of a son, they called him Alexander &amp; saluted him king joyning him with Philip in the throne of the kingdom.</p>
<p id="par115">Philip reigned three years under the adminstratorship of Perdiccas <a id="l1128"></a>two years more under the administratorship of Antipater &amp; above a year  more under the administratorship of Polysperechon, in all six years <a id="l1130"></a>&amp; four months, &amp; then was slain with his Queen Eurydice in  September <a id="l1131"></a>by the command of Olympias the mother of Alexander the great an 4. Olymp. <a id="l1132"></a>115.  And the Greeks being disgusted at the cruelties of Olympias  <a id="l1133"></a>revolted to Cassander the son of Antipater.</p>
<p id="par116">Cassander affecting the dominion of Greece slew Olympias &amp; soon after <a id="l1134"></a>shut up the young king Alexander with his mother Rhoxane in the <a id="l1135"></a>castle of Amphipolis under the charge of Glaucias An. 1. Olymp 116.</p>
<p id="par117">The next year Ptolomy Cassander &amp; Lysimachus by the means of Seleucus made a league  <a id="l1136"></a>against Antigonus  &amp; after  certain wars made <a id="l1138"></a>peace with him  an 2 Olymp 117 upon these conditions that Cassander <a id="l1139"></a>should  command the forces of Europe till Alexander the son of Roxana <a id="l1140"></a>came to age, &amp; that Lysimachus should govern Thrace, Ptolomy Ægypt &amp; <a id="l1141"></a>Libya &amp; Antigonus all Asia.  Seleucus had possest <a id="l1147"></a>himself of Mesopotamia Babylonia Susiana &amp; Media the year  before. <a id="l1148"></a>About 3 years after Alexanders death he was made governour of Babylon <a id="l1149"></a>by Antipater, then expelled by Antigonus &amp; now recovered &amp; enlarged <a id="l1150"></a>his government over a great part of the east, which gave occasion to a new Æra called Æra Seleucidarum.  This Æra according to the Iewish account began in Spring An. Philip. 12. An. 4 Olymp. 116 but according to the Chaldean account it began the next spring &amp; according to the Antiochian &amp; Alexandr account it began in Autumn between</p>
<p id="par118">Not long after this peace (Diodorus saith the same Olympic year) <a id="l1151"></a>Cassander, seing that Alexander the son of Rhoxanæ grew up, &amp; that <a id="l1152"></a>it was discoursed thoughout Macedonia that it was fit he should be <a id="l1153"></a>set at liberty &amp; take upon him the government of his fathers kingdom <a id="l1154"></a>commanded Glaucias the governour of the Castle to kill Rhoxanæ &amp; the <a id="l1155"></a>young king Alexander &amp; conceale their deaths.   Then Polysperchon set up Hercules <a id="l1156"></a>the  son of Alexander the great by Barsine to be king,  &amp; <a id="l1157"></a>soon after at the  sollicitation of Cassander caused him to be slain.   And soon <a id="l1158"></a>after that upon a great victory at sea got by Demetrius the son of Antigonus <a id="l1159"></a>over Ptolomy, Antigonus took upon himself the title of king &amp; gave the <a id="l1160"></a>same title to his son  An 2 Olymp. 118.  And after his example Seleucus <a id="l1161"></a>Cassander Lysimachus &amp; Ptolomy  took upon themselves the title &amp; dignity of kings, having <a id="l1163"></a>absteined from this honour while there remained any of Alexanders race <a id="l1164"></a>to inherit the crown.  And thus the monarchy of the Greeks for want of an <a id="l1165"></a>heir was broken into  several kingdoms, four of which seated to the four winds of heaven were <a id="l1166"></a>very eminent. For Ptolomus</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p021r"> &lt;21r&gt; </span>
<p id="par119">Iustin represents that Hercules was slain before Alexander, &amp; the Canon produces <a id="l1167"></a>the reign of Alexander to the 19<sup>th</sup> year after the death of his father Alexander <a id="l1168"></a>the great, &amp; makes the 20<sup>th</sup> year of Philip to be the first of Ptolomy.  Whether the <a id="l1169"></a>Monarchy  was dissolved &amp; became divided into several kingdoms this year or a year or two <a id="l1170"></a>before is of no consequence.</p>
<p id="par120">At the time of this division Ptolomy reigned over  Egypt  Libya &amp; Æthiopia,  Antigonus over Asia &amp; Syria, Seleucus over Babylonia &amp; all the east from Euphrates to <a id="l1172"></a>India &amp; Cassander  over Macedon Greece &amp; Epire.  And thus was the Monarchy <a id="l1173"></a>of the Greeks at its first dissolution divided into four great kingdoms to the four <a id="l1174"></a>winds of heaven.  Thrace was not  absolutely a part of Alexanders  kingdom: Lysi<a id="l1175"></a>machus with a small body of Alexanders forces made war upon the king of the Thracians &amp; subdued them after Alexanders death.</p>
<p id="par121">Cassander being afraid of the power of Antigonus combined with Lysimachus <a id="l1176"></a>Ptolomy &amp; Seleucus against him.   Lysimachus invaded  the <a id="l1177"></a>parts of Asia next the Helespont, Ptolomy  subdued  Cœbyria &amp;  Phœnicia &amp; Selecus <a id="l1178"></a>having newly made peace with Sandrocottus king of India came down with a power<a id="l1179"></a>full army into Cappadocia, &amp; joyning the confederate forces fought Antigonus <a id="l1180"></a>in Phrygia, &amp; slew him &amp;  seized his kingdom an 4 Olymp 119.  After which <a id="l1181"></a>Seleucus built Antioch  Seleucia &amp; many other cities in Syria &amp; Asia.</p>
<p id="par122">Yet Demetrius the son of Antigonus retained  a small part of his fathers <a id="l1182"></a>dominions &amp; at length lost Cyprus to Ptolomy but killing Alexander  the son of Cassander king of Macedon seized his <a id="l1183"></a>kingdom An 3 Olymp. 121 &amp; sometime after preparing a very great army <a id="l1184"></a>to  recover his fathers dominions in Asia, Seleucus,  Ptolomy  Lysimachus <a id="l1185"></a>&amp; Pyrrhus king of Epire combined against him, &amp; Pyrrhus invading Macedonia <a id="l1186"></a> corrupted the army of Demetrius, put him to flight seized his kingdom <a id="l1187"></a>&amp; shared it with Lysimachus, &amp; after seven months Lysimachus beating <a id="l1188"></a>Pyrrhus took Macedonia  from him &amp; held it five years &amp; an half, <a id="l1189"></a>uniting the kingdoms of Macedon &amp; Thrace.</p>
<p id="par123"> Lysimachus in  his wars with Antigonus &amp; Demetrius, had  <a id="l1190"></a>taken from them Cana,  Lydia  &amp; Phrygia &amp;  had a Treasury in <a id="l1193"></a>Pergamus a castle on the top of a conical hill in Phrygia by the river <a id="l1194"></a>Caicus &amp; had committed the custody thereof to one Philetærus who was at <a id="l1195"></a>first faithfull to Lysimachus but in the last year of Lysimachus his reign revolted.  ffor <a id="l1196"></a>Lysimachus by the instigation of his wife Arsinoe slew first his son Agatho<a id="l1197"></a>cles &amp; then those who lamented him.  Vpon which the wife of Agathocles <a id="l1198"></a>fled with her children &amp; brothers &amp; some others of their friends &amp; sollici<a id="l1199"></a>ted Seleucus to make war upon Lysimachus.  And  Philetærus also grieving <a id="l1200"></a>at the death of Agathocles &amp; being accused thereof by Arsinoe, revolted <a id="l1201"></a>&amp; sided with Seleucus.  On this occasion Seleucus <a id="l1203"></a>&amp; Lysimachus met &amp; fought in Phrygia &amp; Lysimachus being slain in the battel lost <a id="l1204"></a> his kingdom to Seleucus an 4. Olymp 124.  Thus the  Empire of the Greeks which at first brake into 4 great kingdoms became <a id="l1205"></a> now reduced into two   notable ones henceforward called by Daniel the kings of the south &amp; north.  For Ptolomy now reigned over Ægypt Libya Æthiopia Arabia Phœnicia Cœlosyria Cyprus, &amp; the kingdom of Seleucus was  mighty &amp;   Seleucus was  scarce inferior to the Monarchy of the Medes &amp; Persians.  And all this is thus described by Daniel The fourth king of Persia [Xerxes] <em class="underline">shall <a id="l1209"></a>stir up all against the realm of Greece.  And as a mighty King</em> [Alexander] <em class="underline">shall stand up &amp; <a id="l1210"></a>that shall rule with great dominion &amp; do according to his will.  And when he <a id="l1211"></a>shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken</em>  <em class="underline">&amp; shall be divided towards the <a id="l1212"></a>four winds of heaven,</em>  <em class="underline">, but not to his posterity</em> [ this division not commencing till they were all dead] <em class="underline">nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled: for his kingdom <a id="l1214"></a>shall be</em>  <em class="underline">pluckt up <a id="l1215"></a>even for others besides those</em>.  <em class="underline">And the king of the south</em> [Ptolomy] <em class="underline">shall become strong, &amp; <a id="l1216"></a>one of his Princes</em> [Seleucus one of Alexanders Princes] <em class="underline">shall become strong above</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020v-b"> &lt;20v&gt; </span> <em class="underline">and have dominion: his dominion shall be a great dominion</em>. </p>
<p id="par124">After Seleucus had reigned seven months over Macedon Greece Thrace Asia <a id="l1217"></a>Syria &amp; all the east as far as India,  Ptolomæus <a id="l1218"></a>Ceraunus  the brother of Ptolomeus Phila<a id="l1219"></a>delphus slew him treacherously &amp; seized his dominions in Europe <a id="l1220"></a>&amp; Antiochus Soter the son of Seleucus succeeded his father in Asia Syria <a id="l1221"></a>&amp; most of the east, &amp; after 19  or 20 years was succeeded by his son Antiochus Theos who having <a id="l1222"></a>a  lasting war with Ptolomæus Philadelphus composed the same by marrying <a id="l1223"></a>Berenice the daughter of Philadelphus &amp; after a reign of 15 years   his other wife Laodice poisoned him &amp; set her son Seleuus Callinicus upon the throne.

In this way I conceive it was that Phidon presided <a id="l1288"></a>in the Olympic games, suppose in the 49<sup>th</sup> Olympiad.  ffor we are told that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022v"> &lt;22v&gt; </span> he presided; &amp; in the 50<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, for putting an end to the <a id="l1289"></a>contentions between the kings about presiding, two men were chosen <a id="l1290"></a>by lot out of the city of Elis to preside, &amp; their number in the <a id="l1291"></a>65<sup>th</sup> Olympiad was increased to nine &amp; afterwards to ten, &amp; those <a id="l1292"></a>judges were called Hellenodicæ.  Pausanias tells us that the Eleans <a id="l1293"></a>called in Phidon &amp; together with him celebrated the eighth [he <a id="l1294"></a>should have said, the 49<sup>th</sup>] Olympiad, but Herodotus that Phidon <a id="l1295"></a>removed the Eleans.  And both might be true.  The Eleans <a id="l1296"></a>might call in Phidon against the Pisæans &amp; upon overcoming <a id="l1297"></a>them claim the presiding in the games &amp; be refused by Phidon <a id="l1298"></a>&amp; then confederate with the Spartans &amp; by their assistance <a id="l1299"></a>overthrow the kingdom of Phidon &amp; recover from the Pisæans <a id="l1300"></a>their ancient right of presiding &amp; set up the Hellenodicæ So <a id="l1301"></a>then Phidon  overcame his kinsmen who reigned as Princes in <a id="l1302"></a>several parts of the kingdom of  Tisamenus &amp; reunited their <a id="l1303"></a>Principalities into one Monarchy under himself a little before <a id="l1304"></a>the 48<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, suppose in the 43<sup>th</sup> or 44<sup>th</sup> Olympiad or thereabouts. <a id="l1305"></a>And at that time  the conquered  Princes Caranus his brother &amp; <a id="l1306"></a>Perdiccas his  kinsman &amp; others fled from Argos with Colonies into <a id="l1307"></a> Emathia &amp; there founded the kingdom of Macedon.  ffor Iustin <a id="l1308"></a>tells us that Caranus  with a great multitude of Greeks sought new <a id="l1309"></a>seats in  Emathia afterwards called Macedon &amp; by the command <a id="l1310"></a>of the Oracle following a flock of Goats took the city Aedessa <a id="l1311"></a>made it the seat of  a new kingdom &amp; from the Goats called the city <a id="l1312"></a>Aegeas, &amp; subdued the neighbouring Princes Midas &amp; others &amp; was succeeded in the kingdom by Perdiccas</p>
<p id="par128">4. Herodotus tells us that three brothers who were of the posterity <a id="l1313"></a>of Temenus &amp; whose names were Gauanes, Æropus, &amp; Perdiccas fled <a id="l1314"></a>from Argos into Illyricum &amp; thence into the upper Macedonia to the city Lebæa <a id="l1315"></a>where they served the king of that city some time &amp; then retired <a id="l1316"></a>into another part of Macedonia neare the Gardens of Midas <a id="l1317"></a>the son of Gordius, &amp; there made war upon the neighbouring people <a id="l1318"></a>&amp; thereby  Perdiccas came to the kingdom of Macedon &amp; was succeeded <a id="l1319"></a>therin by Argæus,  Philippus, Æropus, Alcætas, Amyntas, Alexander, <a id="l1320"></a>the last of which was contemporary to Xerxes.  Now the reign of Carneus &amp; these  seven kings <a id="l1321"></a>at about 18 years a piece amounts to 144 years which counted back<a id="l1322"></a>ward from the death of Xerxes will place the beginning of the <a id="l1323"></a>kingdom of Macedon upon the 43<sup>th</sup> Olympiad or thereabouts as <a id="l1324"></a>above.  After Alexander reigned Perdiccas Archelaus Orestes &amp; others <a id="l1325"></a>unto Philip the father of Alexander the great.</p>
<p id="par129">2. The kingdom of Macedon was founded by Caranus the brother <a id="l1326"></a>of Phidon  &amp; some make Phidon as  ancient as Iphitus &amp; tell us that <a id="l1328"></a>the kingdom of Macedon was founded before the Olympiads: but <a id="l1329"></a>Phidon was not so ancient by 200 years.

<p id="par144">Antæus who governed Libya had his  royal seat at  Hirassa or Irasa a  city of Pentapolis  neare  the  haven Apollonia   For Pindar tells us that Hirassa was the <a id="l1356"></a>city of Antæus.   There Battus <a id="l1357"></a>afterwards built the city Cirene the Metropolis of the Province.  In all the <a id="l1358"></a> sea coasts of Egypt from Ioppa in Palestine to Parætonium in Libya <a id="l1359"></a>for the space of above 600 miles there was not one safe harbor <a id="l1360"></a>to be found except Pharus, but from Parætonium along the <a id="l1361"></a>sea coasts of Marmarica &amp; Cyrene were several good ones &amp; <a id="l1362"></a> And therefore the Egyptians  before the con<a id="l1364"></a>quest of Libya  could not be potent at sea for want of Ports but  <a id="l1365"></a>upon the conquest of Libya meeting there with convenient ports &amp; <a id="l1366"></a> plenty of  timber they set out a  potent fleet of long &amp; tall <a id="l1367"></a>ships &amp; this  region being at that time under the government of Antæus he was the Neptune <a id="l1368"></a>of the ancients.  For Neptune was first worshipped in Africa &amp; from thence his worship was propagated into other countries &amp; therefore he reigned in Afric &amp; the Cretans affirmed <em class="underline">that Neptune was the first <a id="l1369"></a>that set out a fleet having obteined this Prefecture of Saturn, whence <a id="l1370"></a>posterity recconed things done in the sea to be under his government &amp; <a id="l1371"></a>Mariners honoured him with sacrifices</em>.  By Saturn I understand here <a id="l1372"></a>the father of Iupiter Belus  Neptune &amp; Pluto &amp; shall presently <a id="l1373"></a>shew that Iupiter Belus was Sesostris.  Whence it follows that  <a id="l1374"></a>Neptune was  the brother of Osiris &amp; <a id="l1375"></a>by consequence the Typhon of the Egyptians  <a id="l1377"></a>&amp; therefor Ammon their father was the first king of Egypt who set out a fleet in the <a id="l1378"></a>Mediterranean.  
ffor Typhon was the husband of Nephtys &amp; was  inter<a id="l1379"></a>preted by the Egyptians to signify the sea &amp; the Priests of Egypt abomi<a id="l1380"></a>nated the sea &amp; had Neptune in no honour. They said that Osiris signified the Nile which in overflowing copulated with the land of Egypt signified by Isis &amp; in running into the sea &amp; being dissipated therein perished by Typhon. And in telling the story of the <a id="l1381"></a>war between the Gods of Egypt &amp; the Giants they sometimes put Neptune <a id="l1382"></a>for Typhon,  where Lucian saith that Corinth being full of fables tells <a id="l1383"></a>the fight of Sol &amp; Neptune &amp; where Agotharcides  relates how the  <a id="l1384"></a>gods of Egypt fled from the Giants till the Titans came in &amp; saved them <a id="l1385"></a>by putting Neptune to flight.  The  outmost parts of the earth &amp; promontories <a id="l1387"></a>&amp; whatsoever borders upon the sea the Egyptians called Nephtys.  And in the <a id="l1388"></a>sea coasts of  Marmarica &amp; Cyrene Bochart &amp; Arius Montanus place the <a id="l1389"></a>Naphtuim a people sprung from Misraim Gen. 10.13.  And therefore Neptune &amp; <a id="l1390"></a>his wife Nephtys are also to be placed there the words Neptune Nephtys &amp; <a id="l1391"></a>Naphtuim signifying in the language of the Egyptians the King &amp; Queen &amp; <a id="l1392"></a>people of the sea coasts.   Certainly Neptune was contemporary to Sesostris <a id="l1393"></a>&amp; <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Anc<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>æus; for  in the reign of Laomedon king of Troy he  &amp;  Orus assisted in <a id="l1394"></a>building the walls of Troy that is fortifyed  that city for Sesostris.  His son Glaucus <a id="l1395"></a>took Ariane from Theseus in the Island Dia &amp; lay with her.  Others of his sons as <a id="l1396"></a>Euphemus Erginus Nauplius &amp; Ancæus were in the Argonautic expedition, &amp; his <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025v"> &lt;25v&gt; </span>
son Atlas was contemporary to the Argonauts being the father of Calypso who <a id="l1397"></a>flourished in the time of the Trojan war &amp; after that war convened with Vlisses. Neptune therefore being two <a id="l1398"></a>generations older then the warriers at Troy  &amp; one generation older then the Argo<a id="l1399"></a>nauts was contemporary to Sesostris &amp; therefore was his Admiral &amp; he &amp; <a id="l1400"></a>Antæus reigned  at once over the kingdom of   Libya &amp; so must be one &amp; the same <a id="l1401"></a>king, &amp; his son Atlas must be his successor in the kingdom.  For the gardens <a id="l1402"></a>of the Hesperides were in the kingdom of Atlas &amp; are placed by Ptolomy, Pliny, &amp; Strabo neare <a id="l1403"></a>Cyrene.

And in the war between the Gods of Egypt &amp; the  Titans Atlas <a id="l1409"></a> was  captain of the Titans  &amp; in <a id="l1410"></a>the end of the war had the  heavens placed upon his sholders, that is he assisted <a id="l1411"></a>his father Typhon or Neptune in that war &amp; then succeeded him in the  kingdom <a id="l1412"></a>of Afric.  ffor the Ancients represented a kingdom by the  frame of the world putting the sun <a id="l1414"></a>moon &amp; Stars for the king the people &amp; the princes of the kingdom.   <a id="l1415"></a>The country of Cyrene was famous for the breed &amp; management of good <a id="l1416"></a>horses &amp; Egypt was supplied with horses from thence,  especially after the conquest of Libya by Ammon.  And thence Neptune Pallas &amp; the Amazons were called eques <a id="l1417"></a> <a id="l1418"></a>And Pamphus who is reputed the author of the oldest hymns amongst the <a id="l1419"></a>Athenians calls Neptune</p>

Atlas was eminent <a id="l1424"></a>for  his skill in this science, Antæus observed the course of the <a id="l1425"></a>Moon which was the hardest part of Astronomy,  was Tutor to Bacchus  in Libya &amp; came from thence into Greece &amp;  in the reign of Ammon, Aristæus who married <a id="l1427"></a>the daughter of Cadmus, carried Astronomy  from Libya into Greece <a id="l1428"></a>The Atlantides a people of Libya say<sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup> that Vranus was their first king <a id="l1429"></a>who reduced them from a salvage course of life &amp; taught them to live <a id="l1430"></a>in towns &amp; cities &amp; that he reigned over a great part of the world &amp; measured the  year by the course <a id="l1431"></a>of the Sun &amp; the Months by the course of the Moon &amp; divided <a id="l1432"></a>the days into hours &amp; was familiarly acquainted with the rising <a id="l1433"></a>&amp; setting of the stars, &amp; after death for his merits &amp; skill <a id="l1434"></a>in Astronomy was honoured as a God.   They say also that he  married his sister Titæa or <a id="l1436"></a>Terra &amp; by her had  many children called Titans two of which  called Hyperion <a id="l1437"></a>&amp; Bisilea were the parents of Helio &amp; Selene, &amp; that the <a id="l1438"></a>Titans asassinated Hyperion &amp; drowned Helio in Eridanus (not in the Po but in the river Nile) &amp; there<a id="l1439"></a>upon Selene threw herself from a house top &amp;  her mother <a id="l1440"></a>Basilea went distracted &amp; disappeared,  &amp; all <a id="l1441"></a>of them were deified.

is he  assisted his father in these matters for advancing navigation being instructed by Aristæus.   And hence it appears that he was the Iupiter <a id="l1448"></a>Belus of the Chaldeans.  ffor Pausanias tells us <em class="underline">that Iupiter <a id="l1449"></a>Belus in Babylon had his name from Belus an Egyptian the <a id="l1450"></a>son of Libya</em> (as he is reputed) <em class="underline">who built the temple in Babylon</em> <a id="l1451"></a>&amp; Strabo: <em class="underline">Durat ibi</em> (Babylon) <em class="underline">Iovis Beli templum: inventor <a id="l1452"></a>hic fuit sideralis scientiæ</em>. And Diodorus: <em class="underline">the Egyptians report <a id="l1453"></a>that many colonies out of Egypt were disperst over all parts <a id="l1454"></a>of the world</em> (viz<sup>t</sup> by the wars  of Sesostris) <em class="underline">&amp; that Belus <a id="l1455"></a>the son of Neptune &amp; Libya led a colony into the Province of <a id="l1456"></a>Babylon &amp; fixing his seat at the river Euphrates consecrated <a id="l1457"></a>Priests &amp; according to the custome of the Egyptians freed them <a id="l1458"></a>from all public taxes &amp; impositions.

For <a id="l1519"></a>these were the ages of the great Gods of Egypt these seem to be the four ages of the Gods of Egypt, in imitation <a id="l1520"></a>of which the Greeks formed the four ages of their Gods.</p>
<p id="par155">In those days the Egyptians using to write in Hieroglyphick <a id="l1521"></a>affected to represent all things by symbols as by putting a trident  in the hand of an Admiral to represent the three squadrons of his fleet, a rod writhen about with two serpents <a id="l1522"></a>for the symbol of an Embassador reconciling two nations, a man  with a syth for a king of a corn-country, a man with rams horns for a king a country abounding with sheep a man <a id="l1523"></a>riding upon an eagle with a thunderbolt in his hand for a great warri<a id="l1524"></a>or soaring high in dominion,  the world for a kingdom, a giant for a  man great in power a man with many heads &amp; hands for a king with his kingdom or  a Captain with his army water for people a flood for an invasion, &amp;c <a id="l1526"></a>a new world after a flood for a new kingdom  after an invasion,  golden apples for <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>scar<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ce &amp; precious &amp; valuable fruit, a Dragon keeping the gardens of the Hesperides for an army keeping a country abounding with fruit-bearing trees, a horn of the sea for a river, the horn of Amalthea for a  river with  fertile meadows on both sides given  by Ammon to his Queen for her  maintenance.  And So when  Hercules took the Globe from Atlas it is to be understood <a id="l1527"></a>that he took his kingdom from him, &amp;  by  Deucalion are to be understood the <a id="l1529"></a> ages of a kingdom erected by an invasion.  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from between the lines &gt; </span>a golden age for a happy age <a id="l1544"></a>golden apples for pretious apples. <a id="l1545"></a>a man or Beast with two or more  faces or heads for a king with two or more kingdoms <a id="l1546"></a>collateral or successive.

<p id="par156">And from these &amp; such like symbols truly interpreted the history of the mystical ages may <a id="l1547"></a>receive some light.    ffor Saturn has a sith to signify that he conquered  the lower Egypt, a country <a id="l1548"></a>abounding with corn.   The Egyptians painted him with two faces becausse he  reigned over <a id="l1549"></a>two kingdoms an old one &amp; a new.  Iupiter Ammon has ram's horns because he conquered Libya a coun<a id="l1550"></a>try abounding with sheep.  Iupiter Belus has a thunderbolt in his hand to signify that he was a great <a id="l1551"></a>warrior.  He rides upon an egle to signify his soaring high in dominion. Mercury has an Embassadors rod <a id="l1552"></a>writhen about with two serpents in memory of his  composing the wars between the nations of Egypt &amp; <a id="l1553"></a>Libya.  Hercules has a club  because he was of the nation of the Megabar Ethiopians next <a id="l1554"></a>above Egypt who fought with clubs.  He took the sphere from Atlas, that is the kingdom of Libya <a id="l1555"></a>A dragon kept the gardens of the Hesperides, that is, an army kept the kingdom of Libya.  Amal<a id="l1556"></a>thea the mother of Bacchus had a horn filled with flowers &amp; fruit, that is a river with fertil meadows on each side given her <a id="l1557"></a>by Ammon for her maintenance.

<p id="par181">Herodotus who travelled into Egypt &amp; is the oldest author who <a id="l1715"></a>has given us an account of the kings of that place, tells us that the Priests <a id="l1716"></a>of Egypt  read to him out of a book the names of 330 kings who <a id="l1717"></a>reigned after Menes, amongst which was Nitocris a famous Queen &amp; that <a id="l1718"></a>nothing memorable was told him of any of the rest except the last of them <a id="l1719"></a>called Mœris,  &amp; that after Mœris reigned Sesostris, Pheron, <a id="l1720"></a>Proteus, Rhampsinitus, Cheops, Cephren, Mycerinus, Asychis, Anysis, Saba<a id="l1721"></a>cus,  Anysis, Sethon, twelve contemporary kings, Psammiticus <a id="l1722"></a>Nechus, Psammis, Apries, Amasis.   This is the best account of the kings of Ægypt now extant, but not without <a id="l1724"></a> some faults.  Menes Nitocris &amp; Mœris were later then the Gods &amp; reigned at Memphis,  &amp; there <a id="l1725"></a> did great works &amp; therefore are to be placed after Sesostris &amp; his son <a id="l1726"></a>Pheron  who reigned at Thebes &amp; were two of the Gods.   Menes <a id="l1727"></a>built the magnificent temple of Vulcan at Memphis &amp; Mœris  built the northern Portico <a id="l1728"></a>of that Temple &amp; therefore reigned soon after Menes so that there is not room <a id="l1729"></a>for  330 kings between them.  For it is not to be imagined that the temple <a id="l1730"></a>of Vulcan could be 5 or 6 thousand years in building.   The last of the three great Pyramids was <a id="l1732"></a>built some say by Nitocris others by Rhodope others by Mycerinus. Mycerinus died before it was finished &amp; therefore she is to be <a id="l1733"></a> placed after him. Proteus  reigned in the time of the <a id="l1734"></a>Trojan war &amp; therefore was contemporary to Memnon.  <a id="l1735"></a>Proteus is not an Egyptian name but a Greek word translated  from the language <a id="l1736"></a>of Egypt as Herodotus tells us.  It signifies a Prince &amp; so may be either Mem<a id="l1737"></a>non himself or his deputy governour of Egypt.   Proteus reigned at Memphis &amp; if he was the father <a id="l1738"></a>of Remphis as Diodorus affirms, he must be Memnon himself.   As Mem<a id="l1739"></a>non built the temple of Vulcan so Proteus  on the south side of that <a id="l1740"></a>temple built the Temple of Venus Kospita  the wife of Vulcan <a id="l1741"></a>&amp; the relation between those Temples &amp; time of their building import that they were works of <a id="l1742"></a>the same king, but Memnon might imploy his Vice-roy to  see the <a id="l1743"></a>buildings erected.   Instead of Sabacus Anysis &amp; Sethon  <a id="l1744"></a>Manetho has Sabacon, Sevechus &amp; Taracus which names agree  better with <a id="l1745"></a>Scripture.  ffor when Senancherib  lost his army  Sethon reigned <a id="l1746"></a>over Egypt according to Herodotus &amp; Tirhakah according to scripture &amp;  <a id="l1747"></a>the predecessor of Tirhakah was So or Sua according to Scripture that is  Sevechus.  Let all these corrections be made, &amp; the Canon of the kings of Egypt <a id="l1749"></a>set down by Herodotus will be as follows.  Sesostris, Pheron, Menes,  Rhampsinitus, Mœris <a id="l1750"></a>Cheops, Cephren, Mycerinus, Nitocris, Asychis, Anysis, Sabacon, Seoschus, <a id="l1751"></a>Taracus, twelve contemporary kings, Psammiticus, Nechus, Psammis, Apries, <a id="l1752"></a>Amasis.

So ready was the ambition <a id="l1931"></a>vanity &amp; superstition of Princes to introduce their predecessor <a id="l1932"></a>into the divine worship of the people to secure to themselves the <a id="l1933"></a>greater veneration from their subjects as descended from the Gods <a id="l1934"></a>&amp; erect such a worship &amp; such a  Priesthood as might awe <a id="l1935"></a>the blinded &amp; seduced people into such an obedience as they  <a id="l1936"></a>desired.  Here then we have the true original of the corruption <a id="l1937"></a>of the religion of Noah &amp; the true cause of its spreading so early &amp; so generally.  ffor this policy of the kings of Egypt <a id="l1938"></a> soon  took with the kings of other nations.</p>
<p id="par202">Was not the great God of the Eastern nations Baal or Iupiter Belus <a id="l1939"></a>the  first king of <a id="l1940"></a>Assyria? And which I pray is more likely that the Court should <a id="l1941"></a>promote the honour of  Kings among the people or the people <a id="l1942"></a>find out these refined ways of doing it &amp; introduce them into <a id="l1943"></a>Courts?  Was it the  interest  of the  people to cheat themselves <a id="l1944"></a>into slavery by  such kinds of state policies or was it not <a id="l1945"></a> rather the  business of the court to do it?   Diodorus<sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> <a id="l1946"></a>tells us that  Belus brought colonies out of Egypt &amp; instituted <a id="l1947"></a>Priests there after the manner of the Egyptians.  And  will you say <a id="l1948"></a>that he &amp; his successors did not by these Priests introuce the Egyptian superstitions  <a id="l1949"></a>&amp;  apply them to their own family for establishing their kingdom?</p>

<p id="par209" class="i0">God &amp; altars for offering oyle &amp; drink offering. For as we build temples &amp; set apart the places so its reasonable to beleive <a id="l1989"></a>that the Ancients before they began to build such temples set apart certain places <a id="l1990"></a>for Gods worship &amp; marked the places by erecting only stones or altars.  For when <a id="l1991"></a>God had appeared to Iacob in  his way to Haran  Iacob said <em class="underline">surely the lord is in this place <a id="l1992"></a>&amp; I knew it not. How dreadful is this place. This is none other but the house of God &amp; this is the gate <a id="l1993"></a>of heaven</em>.  And then to mark the place he took the stone he had slept upon &amp; <a id="l1994"></a>set it up for a pillar &amp; poured oyle upon it &amp; called not only the stone but <a id="l1995"></a>the whole place  &amp; the adjacent city Bethel, that is the house of God &amp; <a id="l1996"></a>vowed that if he returned in peace <em class="underline">that stone should be Gods house &amp; <a id="l1997"></a>he would there give the tenth of all he had to God</em>. This offering of tenths <a id="l1998"></a>shews that he set the place apart   for Gods worship by continual sacrifices  as in the prytaneum or temples of those days.  ffor after <a id="l1999"></a>his return he went &amp; dwelt there &amp; built an altar to God that is he built a prytaneum. And indeed the pillar <a id="l2000"></a>it self was nothing else then an altar for such things as could be offered <a id="l2001"></a>upon it.  ffor when Iacob was returned thither &amp; God appeared again to him, he <a id="l2002"></a>set up another pillar of stone &amp; poured a drink offering &amp; oyle upon it, &amp; called the <a id="l2003"></a>place Bethel as before.  Now  the heathen Betyls  or Bethels were no doubt originally of the same kind with Iacobs <a id="l2005"></a>as the name imports &amp; therefore they were at first nothing else then  marks of places <a id="l2006"></a>set apart for  the worship of the true God &amp; altars set up for  drink offerings &amp; oyle  offerings to him And the erecting such altars seems to have been in use from the beginning. ffor such no doubt were the pillars  erected by Hercules &amp; Bacchus &amp; from this practise the name Bætylus was given to Canaan &amp;  to the stone which Rhea gave  Saturn instead of her son Iupiter.  But when the heathens began to worship fals Gods they abused <a id="l2008"></a>these Bethels &amp;  feigned them to be the houses  of their fals Gods  <a id="l2009"></a> animated by them <a id="l2010"></a> λίθους ἐμχύχους <em class="underline">animated stones</em> as Sanchoniatho calls them that is animated by the souls of their Gods dwelling in them, &amp;  on this  account they made them the objects of their  worship. These  Bethels were at first  such rude stones <a id="l2011"></a>as Iacob found in the feild but afterwards they gave them regular <a id="l2012"></a>Geometrical figures forming them either <sup>a</sup> conically or <sup>b</sup> square or <sup>c</sup> Oval &amp; <a id="l2013"></a>at length &amp; when men grew still better artists they shaped them like <a id="l2014"></a>men &amp; weomen &amp; sometimes like bruit beasts.  And this I take to be <a id="l2015"></a>the true original of the worship of Idols.  For Porphyrius tells us <span class="ns">☉</span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the left margin of f 34v &gt; </span> <span class="ns">☉</span> Porphyrius tells us that Damascans a people of Arabia did every  sacrifice a boy &amp; bury him  υπὸ βομὸν <a id="l2016"></a>χρωνται ὡς ξοάνης  under the altar, which they  used  as a statue.  This altar was therefore a Betyl.  ffor<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 34r resumes &gt; </span> And because the nations turned <a id="l2017"></a>this sort of Altars into Idols  Moses commands that the great Altar <a id="l2018"></a>should be made of unhewn <a id="l2019"></a>stones.</p>

<p id="par210">Now whilest the  Nations <a id="l2020"></a>feigned the stars &amp; elements <a id="l2021"></a>&amp; columns &amp; statues &amp; certain Beasts &amp; Birds &amp; other things to <a id="l2022"></a>be inhabited by the souls of their <a id="l2023"></a>Gods &amp; by means of those souls to be Gods &amp; govern the world, they recconed <a id="l2024"></a>that these things by their motions <a id="l2025"></a>&amp;   operations were significative <a id="l2026"></a>of things to come &amp; thence invented <a id="l2027"></a>divers divinatory arts (as Astrology <a id="l2028"></a>Augury Haruspicine Necromancy,  conjuring Southsaying) <a id="l2029"></a>by which &amp; the crafty artifice of  <a id="l2030"></a> Oracles &amp; figments of statues &amp; columns fallen from heaven &amp; such like tricks the <a id="l2031"></a>superstition of the people toward these Gods <a id="l2032"></a>was extreamly increased &amp; the whole <a id="l2033"></a>world deceived.

<p id="par221" class="i0">the fables of the Gods, have feigned that Apis the son of Phoroneus &amp; <a id="l2149"></a>Io his sister went into Ægypt &amp; became the Apis &amp; Isis of the Egyptians <a id="l2150"></a>that is their Osiris &amp; Isis.  ffor the Egyptians worshipped Osiris in the Ox <a id="l2151"></a>Apis &amp; feigned that his soul resided in the Ox.  So then Osiris, Isis, Apis <a id="l2152"></a>&amp; Bacchus of the Egyptians in the opinion of the ancient  Greeks were not above two <a id="l2153"></a>generations older then Sesostris or Sesac, &amp; by consequence they could <a id="l2154"></a>not be older then the reign of David. And if their wars &amp; conquests suit not with his reign nor with Solomons they must be those of Sesac in the reign of Rehoboam. //9. And yet the fabling Egyptians have <a id="l2155"></a>made them older then the world, feigning that  their Gods 9000 years before the  days of Solon shared the earth  &amp; that in the history of the wars of those Gods mention was made of many Greeks as Cecrops Erechtheus Erechtho<a id="l2159"></a>nius Eripichthon &amp; others whose names  resembled theirs who flourished long <a id="l2160"></a>after  in the times next before Theseus, &amp; that  the habit &amp; statue <a id="l2161"></a>of Pallas (the foundress of Sais &amp; Athens) was also there described  the weomen in those days warring with the men &amp; in the <a id="l2162"></a>division of the earth between the Gods the Island Atlantes (a part of which seated at the straits mouth was called Gador)  fell to the lot of Neptune  who left it to his son Atlas.  But <a id="l2164"></a>Homer lets us know that  Calypso the daughter of Atlas reigned there in the <a id="l2165"></a>times of the Trojan war; &amp; therefore the wars of the Gods of Egypt <a id="l2166"></a>in the days of her grandfather  being but two generations  <a id="l2167"></a>older, must fall in with the wars  which Sesostris &amp; his Princes made upon <a id="l2168"></a>the earth.  Homer places Calypso in the  Ogygian island 18 or 20 <a id="l2169"></a>days sail westward from the island Pheacia or Coryra.  And so many <a id="l2170"></a>days sail Gades or Gadin is from Corcyra, recconing with the ancients a thousand <a id="l2171"></a>stadia to a days sail.  Her grandfather Neptune had several children who <a id="l2172"></a>were either Argonauts or contemporary to them &amp; he with Apollo ( or Orus the son of Osiris) built the walls of <a id="l2173"></a>Troy in the days of Laomedon the father of Priamus.<br><br></p>
<p id="par222">10 The great Bacchus loved two weomen Venus &amp; Ariadne.  Venus was the mistress of Anchises  and mother of Æneas both which lived till the destruction of Troy, &amp; two of the sons of Bacchus &amp; Ariadne were <a id="l2174"></a>Argonauts.  This Bacchus was potent at sea, conquered eastward as far <a id="l2175"></a>as India, brought his army over the Hellespont, conquered Thrace &amp; <a id="l2176"></a> killed Lycurgus the king thereof &amp; killed also Pentheus the son of Echion  the contemporary of Cadmus <a id="l2177"></a>&amp; gave the kingdom of Lycurgus to Tharops, &amp; one of his minstrells <a id="l2178"></a>called by the Greeks Calliope to Oeagrus the son of Tharops &amp; of <a id="l2179"></a>Oeagrus &amp; Calliope was born Orpheus who sailed with the Argonauts <a id="l2180"></a>in his youth.  And by all these arguments this Bacchus was but one generation <a id="l2181"></a>older then the Argonauts &amp; so was contemporary to Sesostris or Sesak; &amp; <a id="l2182"></a>both being kings of Egypt &amp; potent at sea &amp; great conquerors &amp; carrying <a id="l2183"></a>their conquests into India &amp; Thrace they must be one &amp; the same <a id="l2184"></a>man.  And the same thing is to be said of Osiris.   The Egyptians <a id="l2185"></a>relate that he was king of all Egypt &amp; a great conquerour &amp; subdued Thrace <a id="l2186"></a>&amp; there killed Lycurgus &amp; therefore his expedition falls in with that of <a id="l2187"></a>Bacchus. Osiris Bacchus &amp; Sesostris were all of them by the relation of historians kings of all Egypt  &amp; reigned about the <a id="l2188"></a>same time &amp; were very potent by land &amp; sea: All three were great <a id="l2189"></a>conquerors, &amp; conquered the same regions, &amp; carried on their conquests <a id="l2190"></a>by land thro' Asia as far as India. All three came over the Hellespont &amp; were <a id="l2191"></a>there in danger of losing their army: All three conquered Thrace &amp; <a id="l2192"></a>there put a stop to their victories &amp; returned back from thence <a id="l2193"></a>into  Egypt: &amp; all three left pillars with inscriptions in their <a id="l2194"></a>conquests: &amp; therefore they must be one &amp; the same king of  Egypt, <a id="l2195"></a>&amp; this king can be no other then Sesak.  All Egypt including Thebais, <a id="l2196"></a>Æthiopia &amp; Libya had no common king before the expulsion of the <a id="l2197"></a>Shepherds, no conqueror of Syria India Asia &amp; Europe before <a id="l2198"></a>Sesak.  The sacred history admits of no Egyptian conqueror of  Palestine before this king.</p>

<p id="par258">Cyrus therefore took Sardes &amp; Babylon  during the reign of the Medes <a id="l2362"></a> ffor Babylon was destroyed by a nation out of the North (Ier 50.3, 9, 41) <a id="l2363"></a> by the kingdoms of Ararat <a id="l2364"></a>Minni &amp; Ashchenaz (Ier 51.27) by the Medes (Isa 13.17, 19) by the Kings of the Medes &amp; the captains <a id="l2365"></a>&amp; rulers thereof &amp; all the land of his Dominion (Ier. 51.11, 28) And accordingly <a id="l2366"></a>Daniel (chap. 5) told Belshasser that his kingdom was  divided (from him) &amp; given to the <a id="l2367"></a>Medes &amp; Persians, first to the Medes under Darius  the Mede who after Belshazzer <a id="l2368"></a> was slain took the kingdom being about 62 years old, &amp; then to the Persians under <a id="l2369"></a>Cyrus &amp; his successors.  And the Angel  told Daniel (chap. 10.20 &amp; 11.1) that he  returned to <a id="l2370"></a>fight with the Prince of Persia, for when he was gone forth the Prince of Greece should <a id="l2371"></a>come &amp;  that in the first year of Darius the Mede he stood to confirm &amp; <a id="l2372"></a>to strengthen him, that is he stood to assist  Darius in conquering the kingdom of Babylon as he <a id="l2373"></a> should afterwards  assist Alexander the great in conquering the kingdom of Persia.  And <a id="l2374"></a>this is further confirmed by the laws by which Darius reigned over Babylonia.  ffor <a id="l2375"></a> he  preserved not the laws of the Babylonians but introduced the immutable laws of the conquering nations the Medes <a id="l2376"></a>&amp; Persians (Dan 6.8, 12 15) &amp; the Medes in his reign are set before the Persians (Dan. ib. &amp; 5.28) as the <a id="l2377"></a> Persians were afterwards set before the Medes (Esther 1.3, 14, 18, 19) which shews <a id="l2378"></a>that Cyrus &amp; the Persians  reigned not over the Medes till after  the death  <a id="l2379"></a>of Darius but warred under him at the taking of Babylon. And therefore Xenophon (who <a id="l2380"></a> <a id="l2381"></a>having learnt some things concerning Cyrus  feigned all the <a id="l2382"></a>rest so as to write his life as particularly as if he had lived in his court) was not mistaken in producing <a id="l2383"></a>the reign of the Kings of the Medes till after the  conquest of Babylon by Cyrus, &amp; making <a id="l2384"></a>Cyrus king of neither Media nor Persia till after that conquest but only the Commander <a id="l2385"></a>of the armies of those nations under their kings.  And if many of the Greeks  <a id="l2387"></a> have recconed him king of those nations  before, it was because <a id="l2388"></a> he was most known to them &amp; in those early ages  the name of King was usually given   to every head Commander of an army.</p>
<p id="par259">This Darius the Mede (not the father of Xerxes but another earlier <a id="l2389"></a>king)  coyned a great number of four  square pieces of pure gold called Darics or Stateres Darici <a id="l2390"></a> each worth  twenty Attic drachms of silver  &amp; five of them worth a pound of silver. &amp; he was the first King of the Medes <a id="l2391"></a>or Persians who coyned such money.  They had the Effigies of Darius on one side &amp; an <a id="l2392"></a>Archer on the other.  The following kings of Persia coyned only silver money.  See <a id="l2393"></a>Brissonius de Regn. Pers. Lib 11. pag 277, 278. The occasion of this coynage seems to have <a id="l2394"></a>been the  example of the Kings of Lydia conquered by the Medes &amp; Persians.  ffor <a id="l2395"></a> the Lydians coyned money before the Medes invaded them, &amp; being very rich might not only teach <a id="l2396"></a>their conquerers the art &amp; use of money but also supply them with gold.

<p id="par264" class="i0">– the beginning of his reign.</p>
<p id="par265">Astyages married his daughter Mandanes to Cambyses a Persian &amp; of them was born <a id="l2407"></a>Cyrus who leading the armies of the Medes &amp; Persians conquered the Kingdoms of  Sardes <a id="l2408"></a>&amp; Babylon.  By the first conquest he added – large &amp; potent.</p>
<p id="par266">About 40 or 50 years before the overthrow of Crœsus the Medes had invaded this kingdom &amp; after five <a id="l2409"></a>years warr uppon a great eclips of the Sun which was predicted by Thales &amp;   <a id="l2410"></a>turned day into night in the time of a battel, they made peace by the meanes of Laby<a id="l2411"></a>nitus king of Babylon as Herodotus relates.  This Labynitus was the great Nebuchadnezzar as is manifest by the <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ti<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>me of the action. And in the <a id="l2412"></a>reign of another Labynitus the son of this Labynitus &amp; Nitocris an eminent Queen of <a id="l2413"></a>Babylon,  (as Herodotus also relates) in the 17<sup>th</sup> year of his reign Cyrus invaded Babylonia <a id="l2414"></a>routed the army of Labynitus beseiged Babylon &amp; took it – execution.  This Labynitus is by Iosephus called Nabonidus &amp; Naboandel &amp;  Balthazar  Some reccon Laboasardach the predecessor of Labynitus to have been Belhassar but he was a child when he reigned whereas Balhasar was born before the 5<sup>t</sup> year of Zedekiah (Baruch 1.11, 12) &amp; therefore was above 33 years old at the death of   Nebuchadnezzer.</p>

<p id="par268">Herodotus Ctesias &amp; the author of Bel &amp; the Dragon  &amp; most of the Greeks make Cyrus the immediate successor <a id="l2415"></a>of his Grandfather Astyages: according to which recconing the dominion of the Medes must <a id="l2416"></a>have ceased before the taking of Sardes &amp; Babylon. And yet by the scriptures tis certain <a id="l2417"></a>that the Medes reigned till after the taking of Babylon as Xenophon also writes. ffor Babylon was destroyed by a <a id="l2418"></a>nation out of the north (Ier 50.3, 9, 41) by the kingdoms of Ararat Minni &amp; Ashchenaz, <a id="l2419"></a>(Ier. 51.27) by the Medes (Isa 13.17, 19) by the kings of the Medes &amp; the captains &amp; <a id="l2420"></a>Rulers thereof &amp; all the land of his dominion (Ier 51.11, 28) &amp; Darius the Mede reigned <a id="l2421"></a> over Babylon before the kingdom came to Cyrus the Persian (Dan. <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>)  The kingdom <a id="l2422"></a>of Belthasar was  broken &amp; given to the Medes &amp; Persians (Dan <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) first <a id="l2423"></a>to the Medes under Darius &amp; then to the Persians under Cyrus &amp; his successors.  ffor <a id="l2424"></a>Belthasar making a great feast was slain that night &amp; Darius the Mede took the <a id="l2425"></a>Kingdom (Dan 5.31 &amp; 6.28)  &amp; reigned like a conqueror for he  observed not the <a id="l2426"></a>laws of the Babylonians but like a conqueror introduced the forreign laws of the  reigning nations the Medes <a id="l2427"></a>&amp; Persians (Dan 6.8, 12, 15) &amp; the Medes in his reign are set before the Persians (Dan <a id="l2428"></a>ib &amp; 5.28 &amp; 8.20) as the Persians were afterwards in the reign of Cyrus &amp; his successors set before <a id="l2429"></a>the Medes (Dan 10.1, 20 &amp; 11.2 &amp; Esther 1.3, 14, 18, 19)</p>
<p id="par269">Darius was therefore king of the Medes &amp; by the assistance of Cyrus conquered <a id="l2430"></a>Babylon &amp; this is further confirmed by the Angel who told Daniel that he would return to <a id="l2431"></a>fight with the Prince of Persia for when he was gone forth the Prince of Greece should <a id="l2432"></a>come, &amp; that  in the first year of Darius the Mede he stood to confirm &amp; to strengthen <a id="l2433"></a>him (Dan. 10.20 &amp; 11.1) that is to say he assisted  &amp; strengthened Darius in the conquest of Babylon <a id="l2434"></a>as he  was afterwards to assist Alexander the great in the conquest of Persia.</p>
<p id="par270">  Vpon the overthrow of the Kingdom of Babylon Daniel  in the first year of <a id="l2435"></a>Darius understood by books the number of years whereof the word of the Lord came to Ieremiah that <a id="l2436"></a>he would acomplish 70 years in the desolations of Ierusalem Dan 9.2. ffor upon the overthrow <a id="l2437"></a>of that kingdom the Iews were to be released Ier 24.12.</p>
<p id="par271">Iosephus tells us that Cyrus king of the  Persians &amp; Darius king of the Medes made <a id="l2438"></a>war upon Belthasar in the 17<sup>th</sup> year of his reign &amp;  that  while Babylon was beseiged  Belthasar <a id="l2439"></a>made a great feast &amp; saw the hand-writing upon the wall which Daniel interpreted to <a id="l2440"></a>him, &amp; then the city was taken.  Ioseph. Antiq. l 10. c 12.</p>

<p id="par273">Xenophon writes that Astyages left  the kingdom <a id="l2442"></a>of the Medes to his son Cyaxares &amp; that Cyrus only led the Armies of Media &amp; Persia a<a id="l2443"></a>gainst Babylon &amp; was not king of either nation till after the taking of Babylon &amp; that he <a id="l2444"></a>entred Babylon through the river in the night of a great feast when the Babylonians <a id="l2445"></a>were in drink &amp; slew the king of Babylon the same night.  Xenophon produces the <a id="l2446"></a>reign of Cayxires to the taking of Babylon, but Daniel tells us that the king of the Medes who then reigned was Darius the son of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p044r-b"> &lt;44r&gt; </span> <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>Achswerus<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> that is of Oxyares  or Cy-Axeres. So that there were six kings of the <a id="l2447"></a>Medes before Cyrus namely Dejoces, Pharaortes, Cy-Achswerus, Astyages Cy-Achswerus <a id="l2448"></a>&amp; Darius.  ffor Darius might well be the grandson of Astyages being contemporary <a id="l2449"></a>to Cyrus.</p>
<p id="par274">This is that Darius who coyned a great number of square pieces of pure <a id="l2450"></a>gold called Daricts  or stares Darici.  ffor these were coyned not by <a id="l2452"></a>the father of Xerxis but by an earlier Darius, the first king of the Medes or <a id="l2453"></a>Persians who coyned such money.  They had the Effigies of Darius on one side &amp; an <a id="l2454"></a>Archer on the other &amp; were of the same value with the Attic stater or piece of gold money <a id="l2455"></a>weighing 2 Attic drachms or with 20 Attic drachms of silver.  Its probable that  he learnt the <a id="l2456"></a>art &amp; use of money from  the conquered kingdom of the Lydians,  &amp; coyned their gold.  ffor they were exceeding rich. <a id="l2458"></a>See Brissonius de Regn. Pers. Lib. 11. pag. 277, 278.</p>
<p id="par275">In those early ages the name of Kings was  more common then <a id="l2459"></a>at present being given to commanders of armies &amp;  inferior Princes.   The King of Persia stiled himself King of Kings  &amp; the great King. <a id="l2460"></a> In this sence  Cyrus might be recconed a king from the time that <a id="l2461"></a>he first began to command the army of the Medes &amp; Persians.  And this might <a id="l2462"></a> give occasion to many of the Greeks to reccon him the  <a id="l2463"></a>successor of Astyages  tho he  reigned not till after the  taking of Babylon &amp; death of Darius.  Then he <a id="l2465"></a>succeeded in the throne of the kingdom &amp; set the Persians above the Medes &amp; from that time <a id="l2466"></a>(saith Xenophon) spending the seven winter months at Babylon the three spring months at <a id="l2467"></a>Susa &amp; the two winter months at Ecbatane he came the seventh time <a id="l2468"></a>into Persia &amp; there died.  Xenophon Cyrop. l. 8.</p>
<p id="par276">By the Canon &amp; consent of all Chronologers  Cyrus died in  the year of Nabonassar <a id="l2469"></a>218 &amp; therefore since he reigned seven years he succeeded Darius in the year 211.  And  thereby it may be under<a id="l2470"></a>stood how Daniel continued (or lived) to the first year of Cyrus (Dan 1.21) &amp; yet prophesied in the 3<sup>d</sup> <a id="l2471"></a>year of the same king, Dan 10.1.  ffor the year 212 was the first year of Cyrus alone &amp; <a id="l2472"></a>his third year in common with Darius.  ffor as the Iews recconed the reign of Nebu<a id="l2473"></a>chadnezzar from his conquest of Iudea in the life time of his father, so they might <a id="l2474"></a>sometimes reccon the reign of Cyrus from his conquest of Babylon in the life time of <a id="l2475"></a> Darius, &amp; so Ptolomy reccons it in his Canon.</p>

<p id="par279">By Belus  I understand  Ammon. For</p>
<p id="par280">Whom the Phœnicians Syrians &amp; Babylonians call Belus &amp; the Europeans  Iupiter &amp; the Egyptians call <a id="l2485"></a>Ammon.  And thence I seem to gather that  Ammon was king of Egypt <a id="l2486"></a>when Cadmus  came into Europe.</p>
<p id="par281"> Ægyptus &amp; Danaus are by the Greeks recconed among the sons of this Belus <a id="l2487"></a>&amp; therefore they flourished after the coming of Cadmus into Europe. Manetho tells us that Ægyptus &amp; Danaus were  Sethosis &amp; Armais <a id="l2488"></a>&amp; that Sethosis having forces by sea &amp; land left the government of Egypt <a id="l2489"></a>to his brother Armais while he invaded &amp; conquered Cyprus Phenicia <a id="l2490"></a>Media, Persia &amp; other Nations. Whence its plain that Sethosis was <a id="l2492"></a>the same conqueror with Sesostris.   The Greeks <a id="l2493"></a>have  transmitted to posterity many things concerning the wars &amp; actions of Sesostris, <a id="l2494"></a> all which must have been forgotten had those warrs been ancienter then <a id="l2495"></a>the use of letters brought in by Cadmus.

For Herodotus saw some of Sesostris his Pillars erected in <a id="l2499"></a>Palestine in memory of his conquering that country, &amp;  such a conquest cannot agree to the war<a id="l2500"></a>like &amp; victorious reign of David nor to the peaceable &amp; flourishing reign of <a id="l2501"></a>Solomon, nor is there any mention of an invasion of Iudea by the Egyptians <a id="l2502"></a>in the days of the Iudges or at any time before the fift year of Rehoboam. <a id="l2503"></a> Nor could  it be long after: for all antiquity make Sesostris older <a id="l2504"></a>then the Trojan war; &amp;  I reccon him a little oder then <a id="l2505"></a>Argonautic expedition because the Greeks built the Ship Argo  in imitation of the <a id="l2506"></a>long ship in which Danaus  upon the return of Egyptus or Sethosis into Egypt <a id="l2507"></a>sailed with his 50 daughters to Greece.  Sethosis therefore returned into <a id="l2508"></a>Egypt about 10 or 20 years before the Argonautic Expedition  &amp; by consequence invaded the nations in the reign of <a id="l2510"></a>Rehoboam, &amp; so can be no other king then Sesak.</p>
<p id="par282">Well therefore doth Iosephus<sup class="note" id="n46-ref">[46]</sup> affirm that Herodotus ascribes to Sesostris <a id="l2511"></a>the actions of Sesak &amp; particularly his invasion &amp; conquest of Iudea erring <a id="l2512"></a>only in the name of the King.  Which is all one as to say that Sesak was that con<a id="l2513"></a>queror whom Herodotus calls Sesostris.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 45r resumes &gt; </span>
the coming of Cadmus  into Europe ✝. All Antiquity make him older than the Trojan war &amp; I reccon him  a little older then the Argonautic expedition because the Greeks  built the ship Argo <a id="l2515"></a>in imitation of the long ship in which Danaus  upon the <a id="l2516"></a>return of Ægyptus or Sethosis into Ægypt sailed with his 50 daughters to Greece.  <a id="l2517"></a>So then Sethosis or Sesostris lived in the age of Solomon &amp; Rehoboam <a id="l2518"></a>&amp; therefore can be no other king then Sesak.</p>
<p id="par283">We are told in Scripture that Sesak – – – – answers to it.  Sesostris in <a id="l2519"></a>memory of his victories set up pillars in the conquered countries with <a id="l2520"></a>the genitalls of a man if the conquered people  resisted &amp; behaved <a id="l2521"></a>themselves valiantly, otherwise with the genitals of a woman &amp; Hero<a id="l2522"></a>dotus tells us that he saw  pillars in  Iudea with the genitals of a woman. <a id="l2523"></a> Iudea therefore submitted with little or no resistance &amp; this cannot <a id="l2524"></a>agree to the warlike &amp; victorious reign of David nor to the flourishing <a id="l2525"></a>&amp; peaceable reign of Solomon.   Nor is there any mention of <a id="l2526"></a>an invasion of  Iudea by the Egyptians in the times of the <a id="l2527"></a>Iudges  or at any time before the 5<sup>t</sup> year of  Rehoboam <a id="l2528"></a> but in that year Sesak came out of Egypt with an army of Libyans <a id="l2529"></a>Troglodites &amp; Ethiopians which had been subdued before &amp; subdued Iudea &amp; the <a id="l2530"></a>kingdoms of the earth the Iews submitting &amp; thereby preserving their king &amp; govern<a id="l2531"></a>ment.

<p id="par327">1. The histories of the Persians  now extant in the <a id="l2783"></a> East represent that the  two oldest  Dynasties of the kings of Persia  were those <a id="l2784"></a>whom they call Pischdadians, &amp;  <a id="l2785"></a>Kaianides, &amp; say that the Dynasty of the Kaianides imemediately succeeded <a id="l2786"></a>that of the Pischdadians.  And the three last kings of the  second Dynas<a id="l2787"></a>ty they  name Ardschir Diraz, Darab his bastard son &amp; Darab who <a id="l2788"></a>was conquered by Ascander Roumi, that Artaxeres Longimanus, Darius Nothus <a id="l2789"></a>&amp; Darius who was conquered <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>by<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Alexander the Greek.  They omit the kings be<a id="l2790"></a>tween these two  Darius's which shews that their history of this king<a id="l2791"></a>dom is imperfect: but by the names of the kings here mentioned tis certain <a id="l2792"></a>that by the second Dynasty they mean that of the kings of Media &amp; Per<a id="l2793"></a>sia mentioned in scripture: &amp; by consequence by the first Dynasty they <a id="l2794"></a>mean either the kings of the Assyrian Empire or  others who were contemporary to them <a id="l2796"></a>&amp; reigned in Persia beyond Assyria.  And perhaps this might be the kingdom which <a id="l2797"></a>carried the Assyrians captive to Kir.  Amos 9.7.</p>
<p id="par328">2. The  Saracen historians  who write of the Persian affairs call Ardschir <a id="l2798"></a>Diraz by the name also of Bahaman &amp; ascribe to Bahaman the actions of <a id="l2799"></a>Darius Hystaspis &amp; Darius Medus taking perhaps Diraz &amp; Darius for one <a id="l2800"></a>&amp; the same name.  For they say that Bahaman went westward into Mesopo<a id="l2801"></a>tamia &amp; Syria &amp; conquered Balthazar the son of Nebuchadnezzar &amp; gave <a id="l2802"></a>the kingdom of Babylon to Cyrus his Lieutenant general over Media &amp; Assyria <a id="l2803"></a>&amp;  Chaldea: &amp; there they take Bahaman for Darius Medus.  They say <a id="l2804"></a>also that Bahaman was the grandson of Kishtasp or Hystaspes &amp; that Kish<a id="l2805"></a>tasp was contemporary to Zaradust or Zoroaster the legislator of the Ghebers <a id="l2806"></a>or fire-worshippers &amp; established his doctrines throughout all Persia &amp; that <a id="l2807"></a>father of this Bahaman was not a king: &amp; here they take Bahaman for Darius Hystas<a id="l2808"></a>pis.  And this confusion of persons makes it further appear that the <a id="l2809"></a>oriental histories of those ancient kingdoms are very  <a id="l2810"></a>imperfect &amp; uncertain.</p>
<p id="par329">3. And the same is further confirmed by the long reigns which the Oriental historians <a id="l2811"></a>ascribe  to the kings  of these two Dynasties.  For they tell us that <a id="l2812"></a>some of the Pischdadian kings lived a thousand years a piece &amp; that they <a id="l2813"></a>reigned  all together above three thousand years.  And to the first <a id="l2814"></a>king of the second Dynasty they assign a reign of 120 years; to the second <a id="l2815"></a>a reign of 150 years; to the third a reign of 60 years; to the 4<sup>th</sup> a reign <a id="l2816"></a>of 120 years, to the fift as much, &amp; to the sixt called Artaxerxes <a id="l2817"></a>Longimanus a reign of 112 years.   So then as the Egyptians have <a id="l2825"></a>made the two first Dynastys of the kings of their Empire (those who reigned at Thebes &amp; Memphis) much ancienter <a id="l2826"></a>then the truth, so the Persians have done the like to the two first Dynasties of <a id="l2827"></a>their kings.  And we are to expect as little of certainty from the  records of <a id="l2828"></a>Persia concerning their two first Dynasties of kings as from the records of <a id="l2829"></a>Egypt  concerning theirs.</p>
<p id="par330">5 The Oriental historians tell us also  that in those days  <a id="l2830"></a>the Scythians on the north side of the river Oxus  having erected a potent kingdom which they call the <a id="l2832"></a>kingdom of Touran or Turquestan,  invaded Persia <a id="l2833"></a>several times under their king Afrasiab, &amp; that in the reign of the eighth king of the Pischdadians Afra<a id="l2834"></a>siab invaded &amp; conquered Persia &amp; reigned over it twelve years together, &amp; then <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p049v"> &lt;49v&gt; </span> was repulsed  by the tenth king of the Pischdadians &amp; invaded it again in <a id="l2835"></a>the reign of the 11<sup>th</sup> &amp; last king of the Pischdadians &amp; was at length slain <a id="l2836"></a>in the mountains of Media by the third king of the second Dynasty.  If for <a id="l2837"></a>reducing the reign of Afrasiab to  such a  length as exceeds not <a id="l2838"></a>the course of nature, we may suppose that  the Scythians by their first invasion  of Persia <a id="l2839"></a>gave occasion to that revolt of the  Medes &amp; other nations from the Assyrians  which is mentioned by Herodotus: there will be but seven kings of the Pischdadians <a id="l2841"></a>before the  reign of Afrasiab &amp; the revolt of the Medes &amp; three <a id="l2842"></a>more of the Caianides before the reign of Lohorasp  or Cyaxeres &amp; the <a id="l2843"></a> taking of Nineveh by him &amp; Nebuchadnezzar.  And these ten reigns  <a id="l2844"></a>being recconed at about 18 or 20 years a piece will place the beginning of the <a id="l2845"></a> Dynasty of the Pischdadians about 180 or 200 years before the fall <a id="l2846"></a>of Nineveh.  So then the Persians have no memory of any thing done in <a id="l2847"></a>Persia above  200 years before the fall of Nineveh &amp; the reigns of Cyaxeres <a id="l2848"></a>&amp; Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p id="par331">4 The Oriental historians say that the fourth king of their second Dynasty <a id="l2849"></a>whom they call Lohorasp, was the father of Kischtasp &amp; the grandfather of Cyrus <a id="l2850"></a>&amp; great grandfather of that  Bahaman who was the grandson of Kischtasp  that <a id="l2851"></a> is, of Darius Hystaspis: &amp; by these recconings they make Lohorasp as old <a id="l2852"></a>as Cyaxes.  They say also that Lohorasp was the first of their kings who <a id="l2853"></a>reduced their armies to good order &amp; discipline &amp; Herodotus affirms the same <a id="l2854"></a>thing of Cyaxeres.  And they say further that Lohorasp went eastward &amp; <a id="l2855"></a>conquered many Provinces of Persia &amp; had wars with the kings of Touran <a id="l2856"></a>or Scythia beyond the river Oxus which runs westward into the Caspian Sea &amp; that one of his Generals whom the <a id="l2857"></a>Hebrews call Nebuchadnezzar &amp; others call Rahan &amp; Gudarz went <a id="l2858"></a>westward &amp; conquered all Syria &amp; Iudea &amp; took the city Ierusalem <a id="l2859"></a>&amp; destroyed it.  And by these circumstances they  take Lohorasp for one <a id="l2860"></a>&amp; the same king with Cyaxeres, calling Nebuchadnezzar his Generall <a id="l2861"></a>because he assisted him in the taking of Nineveh before they separated <a id="l2862"></a>&amp; went, the one eastward against the Provinces of Persia &amp; the other <a id="l2863"></a>westward against Syria &amp; Phœnicia.  The second Dynasty of the kings of <a id="l2864"></a>Persia began therefore about three reigns or sixty years before the <a id="l2865"></a>fall of Nineveh &amp; by consequence at that time when the Medes &amp; <a id="l2866"></a>other nations revolted from the Assyrians.</p>
<p id="par332">6 I have hitherto taken a view of the times reputed fabulous by the <a id="l2867"></a>Greeks &amp; Latines &amp; shewed that before the reign of Pul  <a id="l2868"></a>&amp; the beginning of the Olympiads – – –</p>

<p id="par342">The Greeks have made the kingdom of Sicyon as old as the flood within 200 <a id="l2969"></a>years &amp; above seven hundred years older then Cadmus, whereas  letters were first brought into Europe by Cadmus  &amp; it is not likely that the actions or names of kings or any thing done in <a id="l2972"></a>Europe could be remembred  one hundred years before the use of letters.  <a id="l2973"></a>‡ [ffor making this kingdom ancient the Greks have  divided Apis the son of Phoroneus into two kings taking his two names Apis &amp; Epopeus for two men &amp; between them have inserted  12  feigned names <a id="l2975"></a>of kings  who did nothing memorable &amp; made them reign 620 years which is above 50 years a piece one <a id="l2976"></a>with another: whereas kings according to the course of nature reigne  <a id="l2977"></a>one with another at a medium but about 18 or 20 years a piece; &amp; there <a id="l2978"></a>is  scarce an instance to be found in any kingdom where the reign of 12 kings taken <a id="l2979"></a>together has equalled 300 years.  So instead of one Minos &amp; one Ariadne some <a id="l2980"></a>of the Greeks have made two Minoses &amp; two Ariadnes, &amp; instead of one Pandion <a id="l2981"></a>one Erechtheus kings of Athens they have made two, giving the name of Erechtho<a id="l2982"></a>nius to the first Erechtheus. And whereas Inachus had seveal sons  Phoroneus <a id="l2983"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="40 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> reigning in several parts of <a id="l2984"></a>Argos &amp; these again divided their dominions amongst their sons, the Greeks  <a id="l2985"></a>to make the kingdom of Argos look ancient have reduced several of these collateral <a id="l2986"></a>into one race of kings reigning successively at Argos.</p>
<p id="par343"> in the latter end <a id="l2987"></a>of Davids</p>

<p id="par345">2 The kingdom of the Syrians of Damascus was founded  in the end of Davids <a id="l2993"></a>reign,  &amp; grew great under its kings Benhadad  &amp; Hazael in the reign of Iehosaphat &amp; <a id="l2994"></a> Ioas &amp;  Iosephus tells<sup class="note" id="n52-ref">[52]</sup> that they worshipped these two kings <a id="l2995"></a>as Gods for their benefactions  boasting <a id="l2996"></a>their antiquity &amp; not knowing that they were novel &amp; lived not above 1100 <a id="l2997"></a>years before his days. And Iustin tells us<sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> that the Syrians worshipped also Arathes <a id="l2998"></a>(the wife of the  founder of the city as a Goddes</p>
<p id="par346">In like manner the Ægyptians made their deified kings  very <a id="l2999"></a>ancient, though they were no older then the days of David Solomon &amp; Rehoboam. <a id="l3000"></a>These Gods reigned at Thebes &amp; were the first kings who reigned over all Egypt <a id="l3001"></a>including Thebais.  And the next race of kings reigned at Memphys &amp; adorned <a id="l3002"></a>that city.   Homer celebrates Thebes but makes no mention <a id="l3003"></a>of Memphys &amp; therefore the Gods of Egypt  had  adorned Thebes before Homers <a id="l3004"></a>days  but Memphys by the reign of her kings grew splendid &amp; famous afterwards. The Egyptians reccon <a id="l3006"></a> that Meres reigned next after their Gods &amp;  built Memphys &amp;  the <a id="l3007"></a>magnificent Temple of Vulcan therein: &amp;  that one of his sons built his <a id="l3008"></a>palace in that city.  Menes was therefore the founder of the Dynasty of kings who <a id="l3009"></a>reigned at Memphys &amp; so could not be much earlier then Homers days.  four <a id="l3010"></a>of his successors Rhampsinitus, Mœris, Asychis &amp; Psammiticus built four sumptuous <a id="l3011"></a>Porticos to that Temple, &amp; Psammiticus reigned above 300 years later then Sesak <a id="l3012"></a>&amp; it is not likely that that Temple could be  above 300 years in building. <a id="l3013"></a>&amp; therefore Menes was not so old as Sesak.   But the Egyptians for magnifying <a id="l3014"></a>the antiquity of their Gods &amp; Kingdom have made him older then the  world <a id="l3015"></a>&amp; for making out this recconing have multiplied the names of their kings &amp; given <a id="l3016"></a>us a very confused account of their antiquities.  Herodotus tells us that the Egyptians <a id="l3017"></a>read out of their books the names of 330 kings who reigned between Menes &amp; <a id="l3018"></a>Sesostris who is Sesak, &amp; yet Sesostris reigned at Thebes &amp; Menes  <a id="l3019"></a>&amp; his successors reigned afterwards at Memphis. <span class="ns">☉</span></p>
<p id="par347">In the days of the patriarchs kingdoms were but small &amp; almost every city <a id="l3020"></a>had its king.  The lower Egypt – – – &amp; made the great lake of Mœris with two <a id="l3021"></a>Pyramids in it.  In the reigns of Asychis &amp; Anyses, Egypt became divided into several <a id="l3022"></a>kingdoms.  Gnephactus – – – – – – – – &amp; then Egypt &amp; Ethiopia were invaded &amp; conquered by the <a id="l3023"></a>Assyrians.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p052r"> &lt;52r&gt; </span>
<p id="par348">4 Inachus had several sons who reigned in several parts of Peloponnesus,  <a id="l3024"></a>&amp; there built towns as Phoroneus who built Phoronicum afterwards called Argos from Argus <a id="l3025"></a>his grandson,  Ægialeus who built Ægialea afterwards called Sicyon from Sicyon <a id="l3026"></a>the grandson of Erechtheus, Phegeus who built Phegea afterward called Psophis from Psophis <a id="l3027"></a>the daughter of Lycaon.  And these were the oldest towns in Peloponnesus.  Phoroneus had <a id="l3028"></a>also several children &amp; grandchildren who  reigned in several places &amp; <a id="l3029"></a> as  Car Spartus Apis.  And this division &amp; subdivision of territories <a id="l3030"></a>has made great confusion in the  history of the kingdoms of Peloponnesus.  But the <a id="l3031"></a>later Greeks to make the kingdom of Argos look ancient have collected several <a id="l3032"></a> collateral  Princes into one series of kings pretended to reign successively at Argos.</p>
<p id="par349">5B Apis was the grandson of Ægyaleus by the fathers side &amp; the grandson of Phoro<a id="l3033"></a>neus  by the mothers  side, being the son of Niobe <a id="l3034"></a>the daughter of Phoroneus &amp; Herodotus tells us that Apis in the Greek tongue is Epaphus. <a id="l3035"></a>But the later Greeks to make the kingdom of Sicyon look ancient have made two men of these two names  Apis &amp; Epopeus &amp; between <a id="l3036"></a>them <a id="l3037"></a>inserted 12 feigned names of kings  who did nothing, making those kings  reign 620 years which is <a id="l3038"></a>above 50 years a piece one with another: whereas kings according to the course of <a id="l3039"></a>nature reigne one with another at a medium but 18 or 20 years a piece, &amp; there <a id="l3040"></a>is scarce an instance to be found in any kingdom where the reign of 12 Kings taken <a id="l3041"></a>together has equalled  one half of 620 years.</p>
<p id="par350">6. And as of one Apis or Epaphus the Greeks have made two kings so of one Minos &amp; one <a id="l3042"></a>Ariadne some of the Greeks have made two Minoses &amp; two Ariadnes, &amp; of one Pandion &amp; <a id="l3043"></a>one Erichtheus king of Athens they have made two, giving the name of Erechthonius to the first <a id="l3044"></a>Erechtheus, &amp; of one Inachus &amp; one Io his daughter they have made two, corruptly writing Iasus <a id="l3045"></a>for the second Inachus.</p>
<p id="par351">3  The Greeks before the times of the seven wise men wrote only in <a id="l3046"></a>verse &amp; had no history or Chronology in prose but recconed times only by genealogies &amp; <a id="l3047"></a> by the  number of kings reigning successively in any Kingdom &amp; the number of Priests <a id="l3048"></a>succeeding one another in any Temple; &amp; the Greeks who first wrote of these things <a id="l3049"></a>in prose made it their busines to collect the  genealogies of men  <a id="l3050"></a>&amp; the successions of Kings &amp; Priests &amp;  Olympic victors:  Then <a id="l3051"></a>they conjectured  the number of years  by the number of generations <a id="l3052"></a>or reigns between things done, &amp; at length Timæus Siculus sixty years after the <a id="l3053"></a>death of Alexander the great adapted these recconings to the Olympiads, &amp; so framed <a id="l3054"></a>a chronology  which with very little alteration has been ever since <a id="l3055"></a>followed by the Greeks.  But in doing these things the Greeks have multiplied the  <a id="l3056"></a>number of reigns beyond the truth &amp; made the reigns of single kings very much too long <a id="l3057"></a>for the course of nature</p>
<p id="par352">5 The kingdom of Sicyon founded by Ægialeus the brother of Phoroneus, the Greeks <a id="l3058"></a>have made as old as the flood within 200 years &amp; above 700 years older then Cadmus <a id="l3059"></a>whereas letters were first bought into Europe by Cadmus &amp; it is not likely that <a id="l3060"></a> the actions or names of kings or any thing done in Europe could be remembred one <a id="l3061"></a>hundred years without the use of letters.  Apis was the grandson of Ægialeus – – – – one <a id="l3062"></a>half of 620 years.</p>
<p id="par353">7 The intervall between the  return of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus <a id="l3063"></a>&amp; the invasions of Greece by the Persians, the Greeks have  stated by the reigns <a id="l3064"></a>of the kings of Sparta in that interval . There were two races of these kings &amp; <a id="l3065"></a>seventeen successive kings in each race.  And recconing a reign equall to a <a id="l3066"></a>generation, they have made these kings reign one with another about 36 <a id="l3067"></a>years a piece, &amp; thereby they have made this interval about 370 years too  great. <a id="l3068"></a> ffor kings according to the course of <a id="l3069"></a>nature reign but about 18 or 20 years a piece one with another at a <a id="l3070"></a>medium.  And by this means all things done in Greece before the return of the <a id="l3071"></a>Heraclides  were represented 270 years older then they  would otherwise have been</p>

<p id="par354">As the churches both Greek &amp; Latin in the days of Tertullian accounted  <a id="l3072"></a>the Montanists guilty of polytheism: so here the Bishops of the Greek Church declare <a id="l3073"></a>the opinions of Montanus about the Deity to be blasphemous &amp;  with relation to the opinions <a id="l3074"></a>of Sabellius Paul of Samosat &amp; Marcellus &amp; such like heresies call him the  ringleader of all the hereticks, that is of all which flourished after him.   <a id="l3076"></a>And this  continued to be the opinion of the Greek church concerning Montanism till the middle <a id="l3077"></a>of the fourth Century.</p>

He conquered the kingdom of the Persians called Elam in scripture &amp; therein set up the Medo Persian Empire which makes it probable that the Dynasty of the Pischdadians was this Kingdom of Elam.

And when Ioshua <a id="l3209"></a>conquered the land of Canaan every city of the Canaanites had it's own <a id="l3210"></a>king like the cities of Europe before the Olympiads: which is an argument that towns began to be built  in Canaan not many ages before <a id="l3211"></a>For  the Patriarchs  wandred in Tents  through Canaan &amp; fed their flocks wherever they pleased, the  <a id="l3212"></a>fields of Phœnicia being not yet appropriated.

<p id="par389">Hesiod reciting the fable of the four first ages of the world calls <a id="l3330"></a>his own age the fift,  &amp; describes these ages to be so many generations each of which ended  when the <a id="l3331"></a>men then living  grew old &amp; drop into the <a id="l3332"></a>grave, &amp; that the fourth age was that of the Demi-Gods &amp; ended with the warrs of Thebes &amp; Troy <a id="l3333"></a>The last man of the brazen age was Talus the son of Minos a <a id="l3334"></a>brazen man who was slain in Crete by the Argonauts &amp; therefore this age ended with <a id="l3335"></a>the Argonautic expedition.  Minos is called the son of Iupiter, but <a id="l3336"></a>this phrase among the ancients signified nothing more then that he was <a id="l3337"></a>the son of a king.  Echemenes an ancient author cited by Athanæus (lib. 13 p. 601) tells <a id="l3338"></a>us that he was that Iupiter who committed the rape upon Ganimede.  <a id="l3339"></a> He was also that Iupiter who was educated in mount Ida by the Idæi Dactyli &amp; whose <a id="l3340"></a>Sepulcher was shewn in Crete.

So then this fable seem to <a id="l3347"></a>have been a Cretan invention &amp; signifies nothing more then the four <a id="l3348"></a>first ages   of the Phœnician colonies which came with Cadmus &amp; <a id="l3349"></a>Europa into  Europe, the first age comprehnding the reign of <a id="l3350"></a>Asterius &amp; Europa in Crete, the second that of Minos, the third the <a id="l3351"></a>survivorship of  the children of Minos till <a id="l3352"></a>the Argonautic expedition &amp; death of Talus, &amp; the fourth the age <a id="l3353"></a>of his grandsons till the end of the Trojan war,  &amp; Hesiod wrote <a id="l3354"></a>in the fift.

[This Iupiter the Greeks called the Theban Iupiter <a id="l3486"></a>meaning Iupiter Ammon.  ffor the Egyptian name of Thebes <a id="l3487"></a>was Ammon-no, which the Greeks translated Διόσπολις. Dio<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p057v-01"> &lt;57v&gt; </span>dorus tells us that the  Temple of Iupiter Ammon in Libya, where <a id="l3488"></a>Alexander the great consulted the Oracle of that God, was built by <a id="l3489"></a>Danaus, &amp; no doubt he built it in the reign of his brother Sesak for governing the Libyans &amp; bringing <a id="l3490"></a>them under the laws of Egypt. The Pelasgians erected the temple  &amp; Oracle of Iupiter Dodonæus, &amp; this Temple was common to the whole <a id="l3492"></a>nation, that is, the Deputies of their cities met at set times of the year <a id="l3493"></a>to sacrifice &amp;   consider of the common welfare of the cities <a id="l3494"></a>&amp; consult the Oracle  or cause it to be consulted  for giving authority to their  resolutions Before this Oracle was erected, the  Grecians had no <a id="l3496"></a>particular names of several Gods but called them all by the gene<a id="l3497"></a>ral name of Gods.  By the dictates of this Oracle of Dodona the Pelas<a id="l3498"></a>gians received the names of the Gods of Egypt &amp; propagated them into <a id="l3499"></a>all Greece.</p>
<p id="par408">One of the most famous Oracles of Greece was the Delphic – – – – Re<a id="l3500"></a>hoboams when Sesostris  was invading the nations but had not yet begun to invade Greece.

And these examples were soon followed by erecting several other Oracles both in Egypt &amp; Greece</p>
<p id="par409">One of the most famous Oracles of Greece was the Delphic. <a id="l3510"></a>Acrisius founding an Amphictyonic Council of about twelve neigh<a id="l3511"></a>bouring cities to meet every spring &amp; autumn at Delphos, built <a id="l3512"></a>the Temple of Delphus for them to meet  &amp; sacrifice  &amp; make laws for the cities &amp; set up this Oracle in it  &amp; committed the temple to their care.  And the first Priestess was Phe<a id="l3514"></a>monoe or Phanothea the wife of Icarius.  She invented <a id="l3515"></a>hexameter verses &amp; gave her Oracles in them.  Clemens <a id="l3516"></a>saith that she began to give Oracles to Acrisius seven <a id="l3517"></a>&amp; twenty years before the days of Orpheus Musæus <a id="l3518"></a>&amp; Linus.<sup class="note" id="n59-ref">[59]</sup> She  predicted that the God Bacchus should come <a id="l3519"></a>in the days of Icarius, &amp; when  he came he presented Icarius with wine &amp; lay with his daughter Erigona.

For if the weomen    who delivered the <a id="l3547"></a>Oracles should have given other laws to Pelasgia &amp; to the Cities  under the Amphictyonic <a id="l3548"></a>council, then such as were agreeable to the mind of the Councils  which met &amp; presided in those Temples, <a id="l3550"></a>the Counsellours would have met to no purpose.  The Councils had the govern<a id="l3551"></a>ment of the Temples in their hands &amp; were able to inquire into every thing done <a id="l3552"></a>therin &amp; to put in &amp; turn out any of the Priestesses &amp; therefore could not be <a id="l3553"></a>imposed upon by them, but knew how by their means to impose upon the people  who had <a id="l3554"></a>it not in their power to inquire into what was done in the Temples. And the <a id="l3555"></a>same is to be understood of the Oracles  in Egypt &amp; Libya from whence the Greeks had the use of them <a id="l3557"></a> The king of Egypt who built the <a id="l3559"></a>Temple of Iupiter in his royal city Thebes, &amp; his viceroy Danaus who built the <a id="l3560"></a>Temple of Iupiter Ammon in Libya, would never have permitted weomen to give <a id="l3561"></a>laws to all Egypt &amp; Libya by delivering Oracles in their Temples, had they <a id="l3562"></a>not known how to give laws to the weomen. Ammon &amp;  Osiris being great <a id="l3563"></a>conquerors gave laws to their people  &amp; so did Isis after the death of her husband by the assistance of Mercury <a id="l3565"></a>&amp; these Oracles shew what method  was used to establish their laws. //Osiris <a id="l3566"></a>divided all Egypt into 36 Nomes or Provinces &amp; built a Temple for every <a id="l3567"></a>Nome &amp; ordered the Temples in such manner that  the people of <a id="l3568"></a>every Nome met in their own Temple  at set times of the year to  worship <a id="l3569"></a>to their own God with sacrifices &amp; feasting &amp; to buy &amp; sell &amp; consult for the <a id="l3570"></a>welfare of the Nome &amp; several  Nomes worshipped several Gods after several <a id="l3571"></a>manners: &amp; for Osiris to set up such a constitution of many  religions in Egypt required the autho<a id="l3572"></a>rity of an Oracle.  Or, if you please, it required the authority of an Ora<a id="l3573"></a>cle in every Nome.  And therefore he erected Oracles  to the several Gods of the Nomes some of which continued <a id="l3577"></a>in  vogue till the days of  Herodotus,<sup class="note" id="n62-ref">[62]</sup> as the Oracle of Hercules,  <a id="l3578"></a>that of Apollo, that of Minerva, that of Diana, that of Mars, that of <a id="l3579"></a>Iupiter.  But of all the Oracles that  of Latona in the city Buti <a id="l3580"></a>remained most in credit.  These Oracles were not all alike, but delivered <a id="l3581"></a>themselves after different manners.   Whence it seems to me that as every <a id="l3582"></a>Nome had its own  God &amp; its own Temple &amp; its own  way of worship <a id="l3583"></a>&amp; its own Council which met in the Temple of its God, so it had an Oracle of <a id="l3584"></a>its own God  by which the  Council gave laws to the Nome till the religion of <a id="l3585"></a> the Nome was established.  And these were the means by which Osiris <a id="l3586"></a> Isis  Orus  <a id="l3587"></a>&amp; Mercury set up the worship of their  friends in Egypt as fast as <a id="l3588"></a>they died.</p>
<p id="par416">And after the example of the Ægyptians  the kings <a id="l3589"></a>of Greece did the like in their kingdoms.  Before Oracles began to be <a id="l3590"></a>erected in Greece, the Greeks had not several names for several Gods <a id="l3591"></a>but called them all by the general names of Gods.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p058r"> &lt;58r&gt; </span>
<p id="par417" class="i0">And for the same reason the principal temples of Egypt &amp; Greece which were in <a id="l3592"></a>the hands of lawmakers had Oracles in them, as the Temples of Delphos where <a id="l3593"></a>the Amphictyonic Council met to make laws for Greece: the Temple at Dodona <a id="l3594"></a> built by the Pelasgians for all their nation, the <a id="l3595"></a>Tem</p>

When Acrisius erected the Amphictyonic council <a id="l3599"></a>&amp; built a Temple  at Delphos for them to meet <a id="l3600"></a>in, to give credit to the Council he  set up an Oracle in the Temple to give credit to the laws of that Council [not for the woman who <a id="l3601"></a>delivered the Oracles to give laws to the Council, but for the Council by the <a id="l3602"></a> Oracles to give laws to all the Cities.   <a id="l3603"></a>ffor the Amphictyons or Elders of the Cities who met &amp; composed the Coun<a id="l3604"></a>cil  had the management of the affairs of the Temple in their <a id="l3605"></a>hands  with authority to  put in examin &amp; turn out the Priestesses <a id="l3606"></a>who delivered the Oracles.]  And the same is to be understood of all the Oracles <a id="l3607"></a> in  Temples built by public authority such as were the <a id="l3608"></a>Temple of Iupiter  at Dodona built by the Pelasgians for all  <a id="l3609"></a>their cities, the temple of Iupiter Olympus in Olympia neare Elis, the Temple of Iupiter at Thebes  built <a id="l3610"></a>by the king of Egypt, the temple of Iupiter Ammon in Libya built by <a id="l3611"></a>Danaus in the reign of his brother Sesostris, &amp; as many of the Temples of <a id="l3612"></a>the Nomes or Provinces of Egypt as had Oracles in them.  For Sesostris divided Egypt into 36 Nomes &amp; built a Temple for every Nome and all these <a id="l3613"></a>Temples  had their Councils of Elders who met <a id="l3614"></a>at set times of the year to consult of the  affairs of the  Nome &amp;   government <a id="l3615"></a> the people of the Nome also comming together to <a id="l3616"></a>sacrifice &amp; feast &amp; buy &amp; sell.  ffor the severall Nomes had their several <a id="l3617"></a>Gods &amp; several ways of worshipping their Gods &amp; these Gods had their <a id="l3618"></a>Oracles,  some of which <a id="l3619"></a>continued in vogue till the days of Herodotus as the Oracles of Hercules <a id="l3620"></a>Apollo in their cities, that of Minerva in the City Sais Diana in the city Bubaste, that of Mars in the city <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Pamuretonis<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> that of Iupiter – <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> that in the <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> Iupiter: but of all the Oracles that <a id="l3621"></a>of Latona in the City Buti remained most in repute.

<p id="par419"><span class="hspac-n" title="Space left blank."></span> tells us that Before the Greeks began to set up Oracles they had no variety <a id="l3627"></a>of names for various Gods, but called them  only by the common name <a id="l3628"></a>of Gods.  By the dictates of the Oracle of Dodona  – – – history of the ages <a id="l3629"></a>of the Gods.</p>
<p id="par420">When Bacchus invaded Greece he was entertained by Amphictyon <a id="l3630"></a> the son of Deucalion, &amp; in memory thereof there were  <a id="l3631"></a>set up at Athens in a cell consecrated to Bacchus many earthen statues &amp; amongst them <a id="l3632"></a>the statue of  Amphictyon enterteining Bacchus <a id="l3633"></a>&amp; the <a id="l3634"></a>Gods . And  that of Pegasus of Eleutheris who first <a id="l3635"></a>introduced the worship of Bacchus amongst the Athenians, &amp; did it by the autho<a id="l3636"></a>rity of the Delphic Oracle.  This is that Amphictyon who by the advice of <a id="l3637"></a>Acrisius erected the Amphictyonic Council, appointing it to meet every <a id="l3638"></a>spring &amp; autumn both at Delphos in the Temple of Apollo &amp; at <a id="l3639"></a>Thermopylæ in the temple of Ceres or at  one of those places in spring &amp; at the other in autumn.  They tell us that when the rain <a id="l3640"></a>fell which overflowed Thessaly   where he reigned &amp; caused his flood, he fled from <a id="l3641"></a>the rain to Athens &amp; in memory of his escape built there a Temple <a id="l3642"></a>to Iupiter  Phixius. This cannot be understood litterally  without <a id="l3643"></a>a miracle, for Athens where the Temple of Iupiter Phyxius stood was <a id="l3644"></a>lower then Thessaly  &amp; no man without a divine admonition would <a id="l3645"></a>fly from rain before  he was in danger by the rising of the water &amp; then the water would   <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p057v-b"> &lt;57v&gt; </span>  hinder his flight.  Iupiter Phyxius signifies  the Iupiter  <a id="l3646"></a>of them that fly, [that is of them that fly from  danger] And the <a id="l3647"></a> flood from which Deucalion fled I take to be the invasion of his kingdom by Bacchus .  He fled with his son Amphictyon to Athens <a id="l3649"></a>&amp; there  they made their peace with Bacchus.  For there Amphictyon entertained <a id="l3650"></a> Bacchus &amp; his  great men at a feast &amp; erected an altar to him &amp; there Deucalion erected an altar <a id="l3651"></a>to the 12 Gods of Egypt &amp; in memory of his escape instituted an annual ffestival to [  Iupiter Phyxius ] <a id="l3652"></a>And by these &amp; such like practises the worship of the Dij magni majorum <a id="l3653"></a>gentium was set on foot in Greece.  Deucalion is reputed a scythian &amp;  <a id="l3654"></a>probably  with  a body of Scythians invaded Thessaly &amp; erected a kingdom there a little before <a id="l3655"></a>the expedition of Sesostris.  Some tell us that Hellen the father of  Æolus Zathus <a id="l3656"></a>&amp; Dorus  (from whom the Greeks were called Hellens) was the son of Deucalion <a id="l3657"></a>others that he was the son of Iupiter.  Certainly he was  not the son of Deucalion <a id="l3658"></a> the father of that Amphictyon who enterteined Bacchus.</p>

<p id="par421">Herodotus tells us<sup class="note" id="n63-ref">[63]</sup> that the Phœnicians who came with Cadmus <a id="l3659"></a>brought many doctrines into Greece.  ffor amongst those Phenicians were a <a id="l3660"></a>sort of men called Curetes<sup class="note" id="n64-ref">[64]</sup> who were skilled in arts &amp; sciences above other men &amp; setled some in Phrygia where they were <a id="l3661"></a>called also Corybantes, some in Crete where  <a id="l3662"></a>from the mountain Ida &amp; the use of their hands in manual arts they <a id="l3663"></a>were called Idæi Dactyli, some setled in Samothrace where they were <a id="l3664"></a>called Cabyri, some in Rhodes where they were called Telchines, <a id="l3665"></a>some in Eubæa where before the invention of iron they wrought first in Copper in a city  thence <a id="l3666"></a>called Chalcis, &amp; some in Lemnos, Imbrus &amp; other places.  And a con<a id="l3667"></a>siderable body of them setled in Ætolia which was thence called the <a id="l3668"></a>country of the Curetes untill Ætolus the son of Endymion invaded it &amp; <a id="l3669"></a>called it by his own name. Where they setled they wrought first in copper &amp; <a id="l3670"></a>then in iron, &amp; when they had made themselves armour they danced in <a id="l3671"></a>it at the sacrifices  with tumult <a id="l3672"></a>&amp; clamour &amp; bells &amp; pipes &amp; drumms &amp; wepaons with which they struck <a id="l3673"></a>upon one anothers armour in musical time, appearing seized with a <a id="l3674"></a>divine fury.  And this is recconed the original of music in Greece. <a id="l3675"></a><em class="underline">Studium musicum inde cœptum cum Idæi Dactyli modulos crepitu &amp; <a id="l3676"></a>tinnitu æris deprehensos in versificum ordinem transtulissent</em>: Solinus <a id="l3677"></a>Polyhist. c. 11. <em class="underline">Studium musicum ab Idæis Dactylis cœptum</em>.

It seems that when the Phenician letters ascribed to Cadmus <a id="l3682"></a>were bought into Greece they were at the same time brought also into Phrygia  &amp; <a id="l3683"></a>Crete by the Curetes who setled in those countries.  <a id="l3685"></a>&amp; called Ephesian from the city Ephesus where they were first taught. <a id="l3686"></a><sup class="note" id="n66-ref">[66]</sup>For the Curetes &amp; particularly the Idæi Dactyli who found out iron, <a id="l3687"></a>invented  &amp; taught many other things usefull to life &amp; for their <a id="l3688"></a>skill &amp; knowledge &amp; mystical actions were accounted wise men &amp; conjurers.  In Phrygia their mysteries <a id="l3689"></a>were about Rhea called Cybele &amp; Magna mater: in Crete they were <a id="l3690"></a>about her son Iupiter.  They represented that when Iupiter was born <a id="l3691"></a>in Crete  his mother Rhea caused him to be educated in a cave in <a id="l3692"></a>mount Ida under their care &amp; tuition &amp; that they danced about him <a id="l3693"></a>in armour with a great noise that his father Saturn might not hear <a id="l3694"></a>him cry &amp; when he was grown up assisted him in conquering his <a id="l3695"></a>father Saturn, &amp; in memory of these things instituted their mysteries <a id="l3696"></a></p>
<p id="par422">And hence I conclude that the Iupiter of the Idæi Dactyli was <a id="l3697"></a>Minos.  For they came into Crete with Europa &amp; her brother Atymaus <a id="l3698"></a>just before Minos was born, attended on him all his life &amp;  went with him into Sicily &amp; were left  there at his death. <a id="l3700"></a>Asterius &amp; Minos were the two first kings of all Crete mentioned in <a id="l3701"></a>history &amp; on that account the Saturn &amp; Iupiter of the kingdom.  Minos <a id="l3702"></a>was the most potent &amp;  famous of all the kings of Crete &amp;  so deserves the name of the Cretan Iupiter above them all.   He was the greatest warrior &amp;  most potent <a id="l3707"></a> of all the kings of Greece in his time &amp; the first who gained the dominion of the seas  &amp; therefore deserves above them <a id="l3708"></a>all to be painted with a scepter in one hand &amp; a thunderbolt in the <a id="l3709"></a>other.  He was the Law maker of Crete &amp; was so famous for justice as <a id="l3710"></a>to be accounted the judge of hell &amp; hence justice became the  chracter of Iupiter.  Europa being a Phenician would be apt to com<a id="l3712"></a>mit the care of her child to her countriemen the Curetes who came with <a id="l3713"></a>her into the Island &amp; by their instructions he became so wise &amp; just. Mount Ida was excavated by art with many walks &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p059v"> &lt;59v&gt; </span> 
intricate passages which they called the Labyrinth &amp; there they might secure <a id="l3714"></a>&amp; educate the child.  There they might dig  minerals &amp; make armour <a id="l3715"></a>first of  copper &amp; then of iron &amp; by the help of this <a id="l3716"></a>armour after Minos was grown up they might overcome the native Cretans expell <a id="l3717"></a>Asterius &amp; set Minos on the throne, &amp; then celebrate these actions by <a id="l3718"></a> dancing in armour at the sacrifices.  He was buried in the same  cave <a id="l3719"></a>where he was educated: for <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n67-ref">[67]</sup> Pythagoras went down into the Idæan cave <a id="l3720"></a>to see his sepulchre. Whence Lucian <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n68-ref">[68]</sup> tells us that the Cretans do not only <a id="l3721"></a>relate that Iupiter was born &amp; buried among them but also shew his <a id="l3722"></a>sepulchre.  And Cicero <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n69-ref">[69]</sup> in numbring three Iupiters saith that the third was <a id="l3723"></a>the Cretan Iupiter Saturn's son whose sepulchre was shown in Crete <a id="l3724"></a>&amp; the Scholiast upon Callimachus <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n70-ref">[70]</sup> lets us know that this was the sepul<a id="l3725"></a>chre of Minos.  By Saturn Cicero who was a Latine understands the <a id="l3726"></a>Saturn of the Latines: for when Saturn was expelled his kingdom he <a id="l3727"></a>fled from Crete by sea into Italy.  In those days the Greeks called all <a id="l3728"></a>kings Iupiters &amp; all their  bastard sons the sons of Iupiter &amp; in that sense <a id="l3729"></a>Minos was called the son of Iupiter.    Minos was absolutely the greatest king of  the Cretans &amp; their lawgiver they worshipped him above all other kings  &amp; his worship under the name of <span class="ns">♃</span> remained after their other  kings were forgotten.  And because his father fled into Italy &amp; there lay hid the Latines called hm  Saturn &amp; their country Saturnia Latium <a id="l3731"></a>&amp; themselves Latines. //About the same time, some other Greeks carried <a id="l3732"></a>colonies into Italy as Oenotrus the younger son of Lycaon &amp; Ianus who <a id="l3733"></a>received Saturn into part of his kingdom.  And this was the first memory <a id="l3734"></a>of things done in Italy.  For the reign of this Saturn was the golden age of the Latines.</p>
<p id="par423">The Saturn who according to the Latine Poets reigned in the golden <a id="l3735"></a>age &amp; was expelled by his father was the Saturn of the Latines, &amp; therefore the Iupiter who reigned <a id="l3736"></a>in the silver age was Minos.  For Deucalion's flood which preceded the <a id="l3737"></a>four ages, was, according to the Marble, about 10 years before the com<a id="l3738"></a>ing of Cadmus into Europe that is, just before the reign of Asterius or in the beginning thereof. And Apollonius tells us<sup class="note" id="n71-ref">[71]</sup> that Chiron was <a id="l3739"></a>begot of Phylira by Saturn in the golden age when Iupiter was <a id="l3740"></a>educated among the Idæi Dactyli, <sup class="note" id="n72-ref">[72]</sup>&amp; that Talus who was the son of Minos <a id="l3741"></a>&amp; guarded the Island Crete in copper armour was the last man of the brazen age &amp; <a id="l3742"></a>died when the Argonauts in returning home arrived at that Island. <a id="l3743"></a>These three ages therefore had a particular respect to the kingdom of Crete <a id="l3744"></a>in the days of Asterius, Minos &amp; the sons of Minos,  &amp; by consequence the fourth age was the age in which the grandsons of <a id="l3747"></a>Minos flourished: for Hesiod tells us expresly<sup class="note" id="n73-ref">[73]</sup> that the fourth age <a id="l3748"></a>ended with the wars of Thebes &amp; Troy.</p>
<p id="par424">Hesiod describes these four ages to be four generations of men <a id="l3749"></a>every one of which ended when the men of the generation dropt into the <a id="l3750"></a>earth &amp; were deified &amp; a new generation arose, &amp; saith that he himself lived in the fift age <a id="l3751"></a>which should  be destroyed by Iupiter when the men of that age should grow hoary <a id="l3752"></a>headed; &amp; describing every age to be worse then the former he translates <a id="l3753"></a>the name of the iron age from the fourth to his own as being the <a id="l3754"></a>worst of the five.  And since Chiron was born in the golden age &amp; <a id="l3755"></a>lived till the Argonautic expedition or a little longer, the silver age &amp; <a id="l3756"></a>copper age could not exceed the length of ordinary generations. <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ffrom<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3757"></a>the coming of Europa  &amp; Cadmus  &amp; the Curetes into Crete &amp; <a id="l3758"></a>Greece to the destruction of Troy was about 134 years which being divi<a id="l3759"></a>ded into four equal  ages  allows about 33 or 34 years <a id="l3760"></a>to  an age or an hundred years to three ages &amp; of this <a id="l3761"></a>length were the two first ages together extending to the death of Minos the third  age extending fom the death of Minos to the <a id="l3762"></a>end of the Argonautic expedition &amp; the fourth extending from thence <a id="l3763"></a>to the taking of Troy. I begin these ages with the coming of the Idæi Dactyli into Crete because by what has been said above that  seems to be a parable <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>feigned<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> by them in Crete in honour of their Iupiter.</p>
<p id="par425">In the first of these four ages men lived on  roots, hearbs, berries <a id="l3764"></a>apples, peares, acorns &amp;  &amp; other spontaneus fruits <a id="l3765"></a>of the earth without the labour of plowing &amp; sowing. In the second  the Greeks began to plow &amp; sow &amp; make bread &amp; grow potent at <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p060r"> &lt;60r&gt; </span> sea &amp; by the invention of iron to multiply arts.  In the third they <a id="l3767"></a>grew more warlike but used armour &amp; weapons &amp; utensils of <a id="l3768"></a>copper,  the use of iron, as Hesiod lets us know, being not <a id="l3769"></a>yet spread abroad.  In the end of the third &amp; beginning of the fourth <a id="l3770"></a>they invented the constellations &amp; built a long ship &amp; began to make long voyages at sea.  In <a id="l3771"></a>the fourth they increased their riches in metalls, improved navigation <a id="l3772"></a>&amp; grew more injurious &amp; violent then before.  And these are the <a id="l3773"></a>characters of the four ages  according to the Poets.</p>
<p id="par426">Before the first age men worshipped the supreme <a id="l3774"></a> Iove.  In the end of the first age,  out of flattery, <a id="l3775"></a>they began to call all kings by the name of  Iupiters, &amp; continued <a id="l3776"></a>to do so till the beginning of the third: whence  Niobe the <a id="l3777"></a>daughter of  Phoroneus is  accounted the first woman &amp; Alcmena <a id="l3778"></a>the last with whom Iupiter lay.

<p id="par428">And because they brought the celebration of the Olympic <a id="l3793"></a>games into Greece, it may be  concluded that they came from Phœ<a id="l3794"></a>nicia.

And indeed the names Menes,  &amp; Memnon <a id="l3851"></a>are but several names of one &amp; the same king corruptly  <a id="l3852"></a>formed by the Greeks from his Egyptian name Amenoph.  From <a id="l3853"></a>Amenophor (with the Greek termination) Amenophis,  <a id="l3854"></a>were formed Menoph, Moph, Noph, Menphis Memphis, the names of <a id="l3855"></a>his royal city, &amp; Menes, Memnon his own names.  The name Menes <a id="l3856"></a>is by Eratosthenes interpreted  Διόνιος Iovius &amp; therefore came from <a id="l3857"></a>the word Ammon or Amenoph the Egyptian name of Iupiter. <a id="l3858"></a>This king is also called Amenephthes by Eusebius, Imandes, Ismandes <a id="l3859"></a>Isimander by Strabo, Osimandes by Hecatæus, Osimandues  &amp; Mendes <a id="l3860"></a>by Diodorus.</p>
<p id="par434">Iosephus tells us out of Manetho that this Amenophis was a contem<a id="l3861"></a>plator of the Gods as was Orus a former king – – – – –  <a id="l3862"></a>the mistake that Osursiphus was Moses, &amp; it will  amount to <a id="l3863"></a>this, that when the army of Zerah the Ethiopian was beaten at Mareseh by <a id="l3864"></a>the Iews, the remainder of the shepherds in the lower Egypt <a id="l3865"></a> (who being originally Phenicians were inclined to the leprousy) revolted <a id="l3866"></a>from the Ethiopians,  were forced by them to retire to Pelusium, <a id="l3867"></a>called in the victorious Iews to their assistance &amp; under the conduct <a id="l3868"></a>Of Osarsiphus forced  the Ethiopian army then <a id="l3869"></a>commanded by Amenophis, to retire to Memphis,   &amp; that after Amenophis had fortified <a id="l3870"></a>that pass,  &amp; built a Palace there  for his Queen &amp; son  he left them there &amp; went up into Thebais &amp; Ethiopia  <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>w<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>here he reigned 13 years. That India or some part thereof being in subjection to <a id="l3872"></a>Egypt he sent for a body of Ethiopians from thence to strengthen him <a id="l3873"></a>self &amp; gave them seats above Egypt: for Eusebius tells us, <em class="underline">sub <a id="l3874"></a>Amenophe Æthiopes ab Indo flumine consurgentes juxta Ægyptum <a id="l3875"></a>consederunt</em>.  And that after 13 years he returned with what force <a id="l3876"></a>he &amp; his young son Ramesses could make &amp; conquered Osarsiphus &amp; <a id="l3877"></a>drove out the Iews   with as many of the shepherds as were in <a id="l3878"></a>arms against him.  And to this action Ramesses seems to relate when <a id="l3879"></a>he inscribed on his Obelisk (as Hermapion interpreted it) that he had <a id="l3880"></a>saved Egypt by expelling forreiners.</p>
<p id="par435">Manetho saith that the shepherds obteined Egypt 511 years.  If <a id="l3881"></a> 5 or 6 years may be allowed between <a id="l3883"></a>the victory of Asa &amp; the retiring of Amenophis into Ethiopia  for opposing the shepherds &amp; Iews under Osarsiphus &amp;  for building &amp; <a id="l3885"></a>fortifying Memphis &amp; 13 years more till the expulsion of the shepherds &amp; Iews, <a id="l3886"></a>their expulsion will be about the 33<sup>th</sup> year of Asa.  Count backwards 511 years <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p061v"> &lt;61v&gt; </span> and – – – – – by Ioshuah.</p>
<p id="par436">Amenophis having recovered – – – – – regulation of the year.</p>
<p id="par437"> Before men began  by astronomical <a id="l3887"></a>observations to reduce the courses of the sun &amp; Moon to a rule <a id="l3888"></a>they kept time only by the returns of the Moon &amp; seasons of the <a id="l3889"></a>year, &amp; this made the  years of nations at first to be Luni<a id="l3890"></a>solar.  But after they began to keep festivals upon certain days <a id="l3891"></a>of the month &amp; to distinguish days into fasti &amp; nefasti, &amp; by consequence <a id="l3892"></a>to make Calendars for knowing what those days were, it became <a id="l3893"></a>necessary to reduce the Calendar year to  some certain form &amp; <a id="l3894"></a>this could not be done without  putting a certain number of days <a id="l3895"></a>for a month &amp; a certain number of months for a year.  And  <a id="l3896"></a>hence they framed a Kalendar year of 30 days to a month &amp; <a id="l3897"></a>12 months to a year, reserving to the Priests of every nation a <a id="l3898"></a>liberty of correcting this year by the courses of the sun &amp; Moon <a id="l3899"></a>so as to omit a day in the month whenever they found 30 days <a id="l3900"></a>too long for the course of the Moon or to add a month to the year whenever they found 12 <a id="l3901"></a>months too short for the return of the seasons of the year. <a id="l3902"></a>And this Kalendar year seems to have occasioned the division of the Zodiac into 12 signes &amp; of every signe into 30 degrees.  Then finding by long observation that there were three  months to <a id="l3903"></a>be added in every eight years, they  made the years to consist <a id="l3904"></a>of 12 &amp; 13 Lunary months alternately,  omitting the <a id="l3905"></a>intercalary month once in eight years &amp; thence came the Octae<a id="l3906"></a>teris teraeteris &amp; dieteris of the ancients.   Afterwards the Greeks found <a id="l3907"></a>out  exacter rules of intercaling . But the Luni-solar years consisting of no certain number of days <a id="l3909"></a>&amp; so being unfit for Astronomical uses, the Egyptians after they <a id="l3910"></a>began to apply themselves to Astronomy, tryed to reduce the year to <a id="l3911"></a>certain length &amp; for that end first took the Calendar year of 360 <a id="l3912"></a>days, but soon finding that too short, they added five days to the end <a id="l3913"></a>of it &amp; so composed a year  of 12 Kalendar months <a id="l3914"></a>&amp; five days, &amp; the Romans added a day more once in four years <a id="l3915"></a>to make this year answer more exactly to the course of the Sun.</p>
<p id="par438">For the Israelites brought a Lunisolar year out of Egypt, &amp;  Ammon used this year as above, but in the holy Isle of Nile neare Phylas was a sepulchre built <a id="l3916"></a>to Osiris religiously reverenced by all the Priests of Egypt wherein <a id="l3917"></a>they laid up 360  bowles – – – time by such a year.  And the <a id="l3918"></a>golden  border or circle in the tumb of Memnon being divided <a id="l3919"></a>into 365 days with the risings &amp; settings of the stars in every day <a id="l3920"></a>shews that they  added 5 days to the 360 either in his <a id="l3921"></a>reign or upon his death or consecration.  For the Egyptians dedicated <a id="l3922"></a>those five  days to Osiris, Isis, Orus, Typhon &amp; Nephthe the wife of <a id="l3923"></a>Typhon &amp; therefore  these  days were added to the year after the  reign of those <a id="l3924"></a>five  Kings &amp; Queens.</p>
<p id="par439">Tis agreed that this regulation of the year was first made by the <a id="l3925"></a>Egyptians. So Herodotus: The Egyptians – – – – <em class="underline">&amp; 12 months &amp; 5 days to a</em> <a id="l3926"></a>year.</p>
<p id="par440">The Lunisolar year  of the Israelites in Egypt &amp; by consequence of the Egyptians began in Autumn <a id="l3927"></a>If  upon forming a new year they began it <a id="l3928"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>in<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Spring, as Moses did the new year of the Iews,  the Æra there<a id="l3929"></a>of will commence about the time that Amenophis died.  For this Ægyptian year was the same with the year of Nabonassar <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p062r"> &lt;62r&gt; </span> and began always on the same day, &amp; therefore in the year <a id="l3930"></a>of the Iulian Period 3821, &amp; for three years after, it began on <a id="l3931"></a>the third of April which was then the first day after the <a id="l3932"></a>vernal Equinox according to the suns mean motion, &amp; that <a id="l3933"></a>year of the Iulian Period was 55 years after the victory <a id="l3934"></a>of Asa over the Ethiopians, &amp; so long Amenophis might <a id="l3935"></a>reign.  For his reign in Ethiopia – – – – – reigned 62 years.</p>
<p id="par441">Censorinus tells us: Novissime Arminon ad tridecim <a id="l3936"></a>menses &amp; dies quinque annum Ægyptium produxisse.  Here <a id="l3937"></a>13 months should be 12 (as Scaliger &amp; Salmasius note) and <a id="l3938"></a>Arminon should be Ammonem or Amenoph, that is Memnonem.</p>
<p id="par442">Next after Amenophis reigned his son Ramesses Rameses <a id="l3939"></a>or Rhampses above mentioned.  He is called Rhampsinitus by Hero<a id="l3940"></a>dotus &amp; Remphis by Diodorus, &amp; Pliny tells us that in his reign <a id="l3941"></a>Troy was taken,  – – – –  of a thousand thousand</p>
<p id="par443">Pliny tells us that the first Obelisk was made by Mires who reigned in Heliopolis, &amp; afterwards other kings – – – – – – – – one of 80.</p>
<p id="par444">Between Osimanduas &amp; Miris (i.e. Memnon &amp; Mœris) Diodorus <a id="l3944"></a>places one Vchoreus – – – – – – By these works I take Vchoreus <a id="l3945"></a>to be either Memnon himself or the successor of his son Ramesses.</p>
<p id="par445">Among the stupendious works of  the kings of Egypt <a id="l3946"></a>is to be recconed that vast lake of Mœris with two Pyramids – – – <a id="l3947"></a>– – – – added porticos.  He is called – – – – mistakes.</p>

<p id="par449">Sabacon invaded Egypt about the time that the Æra of <a id="l3950"></a>Nabonassar began, &amp; its probable that that Æra was set on foot <a id="l3951"></a>by some Egyptians who fled from  Sabacon.  For that <a id="l3952"></a>year is one &amp; the same with the Egyptian &amp; Astrology invented a little before by Nicepsos, was propagated to Babylon with that year &amp; put the Chaldeans upon observing the heavens.</p>
<p id="par450">The reign of the Ethiopians over Egypt according to Herodotus – – – – Nabonassar <a id="l3953"></a>as above.</p>
<p id="par451">The dominion of the Assyrians over Egypt lasted two or three <a id="l3954"></a>years.   Diodorus calls it an  anarchy of two years.  Isaias represents <a id="l3955"></a>it by going naked &amp; barefoot thee years.  The Lord said, Like as my servant Isaiah <a id="l3956"></a>hath walked naked &amp; barefoot three years for a sign &amp; wonder upon <a id="l3957"></a>Egypt &amp; upon Ethiopia: so shall the king of Assyria lead away the <a id="l3958"></a>Egyptians prisoners &amp; the Ethiopians captives young &amp; old naked &amp; barefoot <a id="l3959"></a>Isa. 20.3.  And now the Monarchy of Assyria was in its height for in the <a id="l3960"></a>end of these three years upon   a great incursion first of the Cyrreneans &amp;   &amp; then of the Scythians into Asia several nations fell <a id="l3962"></a>off from the Assyrians,  Manasses returned from captivity &amp;  <a id="l3964"></a> twelve Princes of Egypt by consent shared that kingdom amongst <a id="l3965"></a>themselves &amp; reigned 15 years.  One of these Princes – – – – – – – became <a id="l3966"></a>King of Egypt.  He beseiged Azot – – – – – ever since in servitude.</p>
<p id="par452">In the 12 year of Darius Nothus the Egyptians revolted from the Persians &amp; continued <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p062v"> &lt;62v&gt; </span> under their own kings Amyrtæus, Nepherites, Achoris, Psammites, Nepherites II, Nectarebis, Tyos, Nectanebos untill Artaxerxes Ochus king of Persia in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of his reign conquered the last of them &amp; reduced Egypt to obedience.

<p id="par467">Herodotus the oldest historian of the Greeks affirms that Homer &amp; Hesiod <a id="l4090"></a>were not above 400 years before himself.  Homer was the scholar of Demodocus <a id="l4091"></a>who sung to the woers of Penelope the wife of Vlysses.

<p id="par468">The Greeks wrote only in verse till the days of the 7 wise men &amp; when they began <a id="l4097"></a>to write history in prose, they recconed time only by generations of men  &amp; after <a id="l4098"></a> the  days of Herodotus they began by degrees to <a id="l4099"></a> conjecture at  numbers of years, &amp; at length framed the Chronology now extant  by <a id="l4100"></a>the years of the Olympiads.  This Chronology since the  invasion of Greece by the <a id="l4101"></a>persians &amp; the battel of Marathon is ascertained by the chronology of the Persians <a id="l4102"></a>but before the times of the Persian Empire there is nothing certain but the number <a id="l4103"></a>of genealogies &amp; of the kings which reigned in the several cities of  Greece.</p>
<p id="par469">In framing the Chronology now extant the Greeks have recconed the ancient <a id="l4104"></a>genealogies &amp; the reigns of kings at about 34 years a piece one with another <a id="l4105"></a>whereas genealogies by the eldest sons take up but about 27 years a piece &amp; the <a id="l4106"></a>reigns of kings but about 18 or 20 years apiece one with another according to the course of Nature.  Hence it comes <a id="l4107"></a>to pass that the Greeks have made the times of the expedition of Sesostris, the Argonautic <a id="l4108"></a>expedition &amp; the Trojan war much too ancient.  Let  the genealogies by the eldest sons be <a id="l4109"></a>recconed at about 27 years apiece &amp; the reigns of kings at about 18 or 20 years <a id="l4110"></a>a piece &amp; <sup>3</sup> the expedition of Sesostris  with that of Sesac, &amp; the  <sup>2</sup> the Argonautic expedition  with the fall of the Empire <a id="l4112"></a>of Egypt &amp; <sup>1</sup> the Trojan war will fall in with the reign of Memnon,  <sup>4</sup> the colonies <a id="l4113"></a>of Phenicians in the days of Cecrops &amp; Lelex with the flight of the <a id="l4114"></a>shepherds in Egypt from the Cophtites.</p>

And the coming of many colonies <a id="l4143"></a>of Phœnicians  into Greece &amp; Libya in the days of Cadmus will <a id="l4144"></a>fall in with the flight of the nations from David.

And the  Egyptian Thebes will be in its prime in the days of Homer, &amp; the city Memphys not then grown considerable enough to be celebrated by him nor its Pyramids or labyrinth yet built.</p>

<p id="par475">Before the times of these four ages, the  nations <a id="l4193"></a>of Egypt Syria &amp;  Mesopotamia worshipped their kings &amp; benefactors. The Egyptians <a id="l4194"></a>worshipped theirs in the shapes of Birds Beasts &amp; ffishes as appears by the  prohi<a id="l4195"></a>bition in the 4<sup>th</sup> Commandment.   The  Syrians of Mesopotamia had their Images Teraphims or household Gods before <a id="l4197"></a>Abraham went from thence Gen 31 &amp; Ios 24.14, 15 The Midianites had their Baal <a id="l4198"></a>Peor, The Philistims their Dagon, the Zidonians their Asteroth, the Ammonites their <a id="l4199"></a>Moloch &amp; Milcom, the Moabites their Chemosh, &amp; the several nations of Canaan their several <a id="l4200"></a>Baals.   But these Gods had not yet spread into Europe. As <a id="l4201"></a>they  were kings of small kingdoms so their worship was of small extent.  &amp; the Dij magni majorum gentium were not yet in being.   In the times <a id="l4203"></a>of the four Ages the Phœnicians   brought Idolatry into Europe &amp; the Egypti<a id="l4204"></a>ans by their conquests  spread the worship of the Egyptian Gods into all <a id="l4205"></a>their conquests.

At first the Egyptians had but eight celestial <a id="l4225"></a>Gods,  seven of which were the seven Planets , but soon afterwards adding the four Elements <a id="l4226"></a>they made up the number 12.   Without the Elements they  <a id="l4227"></a>recconed the Planets in this order Saturn, Iupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus Mercury <a id="l4228"></a>Luna, &amp; with the Elements in this; Saturn, Iupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury Sol, <a id="l4229"></a>Luna, Ignis Aer, Aqua, Terra, putting the sun always in the middle &amp; concealing the earth. The <a id="l4230"></a>twelve signes they dedicated to the twelve Gods  making them <a id="l4232"></a>their houses.   Whence Homer<sup class="note" id="n86-ref">[86]</sup> makes all the celestial Gods go to feast with <a id="l4233"></a>the Ethiopians &amp; after 12 days to return  to heaven &amp; sleep in  <a id="l4234"></a>their several houses built for them by Vulcan.

<p id="par480">Macrisi an Arabian historian cited by Vansleb represents that Ischemun, Atrib, Sa &amp; <a id="l4267"></a>Coptus, four sons of Mizraim reigned over four equal parts of Egypt: Coptus <a id="l4268"></a>over the upper part of Egypt from Isvan (or Siene) to the City Coptus, Ischemun <a id="l4269"></a> over all the country below  Coptus to the city Menuf (or <a id="l4270"></a>Memphis, Atrib over the lower Ægypt now called Delta, &amp; Sa over the continent <a id="l4271"></a>of Libya between the Delta &amp; Barbary.   And that Coptus overcame all his brethren &amp; <a id="l4272"></a>Chose the city Menuf or Memphis for his royal seat, &amp; that from him the race <a id="l4273"></a>of the ancient Egyptians have been ever since called Coptites, &amp; their country <a id="l4274"></a> Ægypt or the  land of the Coptites the Greeks giving it that name by <a id="l4275"></a>changing K into G.  And that Coptus continued the royal seat of the kings of <a id="l4276"></a>Egypt untill Nebuchadnezzar sackt it   If by the four sons of Mizraim you understand not four <a id="l4286"></a>single men but four nations sprung from Mizraim whose kings reigned <a id="l4287"></a>over  the aforesaid four regions, there may be much of truth in this history.  The people <a id="l4288"></a>of Coptus might  reign over all the uppper Egypt from Isnan or Siene to <a id="l4289"></a>Coptus &amp;    afterwards conquer the <a id="l4290"></a>middle part of Egypt down from Coptus to Menuf or Memphis,  &amp; afterwards the <a id="l4291"></a>lower Egypt expelling the Shepherds &amp; lastly the  people of Libya as <a id="l4292"></a>far  as Barbary &amp; give the name of Coptites to all their conquests.  And in the time of these warrs the Coptites might remove <a id="l4293"></a>their royall seat to Thebes suppose in the reign of their king Ammon, thence calling <a id="l4294"></a>that city No-Ammon, the people of Ammon; &amp; in the reign of Menes or Amenophis <a id="l4295"></a>they might remove their royal seat to Memphis thence calling that city  Amenoph <a id="l4296"></a>or Menuf,  as above, &amp; continue to reign in that city till first the Ethiopians <a id="l4297"></a>under Sabacon, then the Assyrians under Asserhadon &amp; lastly the Babyloni<a id="l4298"></a>ans under Nebuchadnezzar invaded them.  And  the Greeks might give the <a id="l4299"></a>name of  Αἰα Κόφτος Ægypt to all the  Kingdom of the Coptites &amp; that <a id="l4300"></a>of αἰα Θεοφι, Æthiopia &amp; Thebais to  the kingdom of Thebes  before the Coptites <a id="l4301"></a>conquered it.

<p id="par484">The kingdom of Macedon was founded by Caranus &amp; Perdiccas who being <a id="l4326"></a>of the race of Temenus king of Argos fled from Argos in the reign of Phidon <a id="l4327"></a>the brother of Caranus.  Temenus entred Peloponnesus with the He<a id="l4329"></a>raclides &amp;  after him &amp; his son Cysus the kingdom of Argos ceased &amp; became divided <a id="l4330"></a>amongst the  posterity  of Temenus untill Phidon reunited it, expelling his kindred.  He grew <a id="l4331"></a>potent, appointed weights &amp; measures in Peloponnesus, &amp; removing the Eleans presi<a id="l4332"></a>ded in the Olympic games but was soon after subdued by the Eleans &amp; Spartans <a id="l4333"></a>Herodotus &amp; Thucydides reccon Perdiccas the first king of Macedon   Later writers as Livy Pausanias, Suidas make Caranus the first king Iustin <a id="l4338"></a>calls Perdiccas the successor of  Caranus &amp; Solinus saith that  Perdiccas <a id="l4339"></a>succeeded  Caranus &amp; was the first that obteined the name of king. <a id="l4340"></a>Its probable that Caranus &amp; Perdiccas were contemporaries &amp; fled at the same time from  Argos &amp; at first erected <a id="l4341"></a>small principalities which after the death of Caranus became one under Per<a id="l4342"></a>diccas.  Herodotus tells us that after Perdiccas reigned Aræus (or Argæus) Philip <a id="l4343"></a>Aeropus, Alcetas, Amyntas, &amp; Alexander.  Alexander was contemporary to <a id="l4344"></a>Xerxes &amp; after  Alexander reigned Perdiccas; &amp; Pausanias tells us that there were <a id="l4345"></a>eight kings before Archelaus the son of Perdiccas.  Now by recconing  above 40 years apiece to these kings Chronologers have made Cara<a id="l4347"></a>nus older then the Olympiads.  Whereas if we should reccon their reigns <a id="l4348"></a>at about 18 or 20 years a piece, the first seven  reigns counted <a id="l4349"></a>backward from the death of Xerxes will place the beginning of the kingdom <a id="l4350"></a>of Macedon under Perdiccas &amp; Caranus, upon the 45 Olympiad or therea<a id="l4351"></a>bouts. It could not be older because Leocides the son of Phidon, &amp; Megacle the <a id="l4352"></a>son  <a id="l4354"></a>of Alcmæon an Athenian at one &amp; the same time courted Agarista the daughter of <a id="l4355"></a>Clisthenes king of Sicyon (as Herodotus tells us) &amp; the Amphictyons by the advice of <a id="l4356"></a>Solon made Alcmæon  &amp; Clisthenes &amp; Eurolycus king of <a id="l4357"></a>Thessaly commanders of their army in their war against Cyrrha &amp; the Cyrrhæans <a id="l4358"></a>were conquered an. 2 Olymp. 47, according to the Marbles. ② <sup class="note" id="n87-ref">[87]</sup>This Alcmæon <a id="l4359"></a>enterteined &amp; conducted the messengers which Crœsus sent to consult the Oracle <a id="l4360"></a>at Delphos &amp; for so doing was sent for by Crœsus &amp; rewarded with much riches. <a id="l4361"></a>① Phidon therefore &amp; his brother Caranus were contemporary to Alcmæon, &amp; all <a id="l4362"></a>of them to Clisthenes &amp; Solon.

The same Priests of Egypt recconed to Herodotus from the reign of Pul <a id="l4376"></a>to that of Amasis 15000 years &amp; from that of Hercules  to that of Amasis <a id="l4377"></a>17000 years &amp; in recconing 341 generations from Menes to Sethon Herodotus <a id="l4378"></a>put three generations equal to an hundred years, at which rate Menes will have <a id="l4379"></a>reigned above 11300 years before Sethon  repulsed Sennacherib  &amp; above 11500 <a id="l4380"></a>years before Cambyses conquered Egypt.  But we meddle not with the state of <a id="l4381"></a>Egypt before  it was reduced into <a id="l4383"></a>a monarchy.  Its probable that  when the memory of the many little <a id="l4384"></a>kingdoms into which Egypt (like all other nations) was at first  divided began <a id="l4385"></a>to be lost they collated into one list the names of as many of the old kings as they <a id="l4386"></a>could meet with in the Archives of the head cities of those little kingdoms <a id="l4387"></a>&amp; perhaps inserted into the list the names of some famous men who reigned <a id="l4388"></a>not, &amp; repeated the names of some of the kings with a little variation till <a id="l4389"></a> they had a list of 330 kings who reigned before  Sesostris  but did nothing memorable except Nitocris &amp; Mœris &amp; then in honour of their Gods prefixed their names to this list. But the kings <a id="l4392"></a>who reigned before  the Monarchy of Egypt was  erected by Misphragmuthosis Amosis Ammon &amp; Sesac  <a id="l4393"></a>we do not meddle with.  Sesostris reigned in the age of the Gods being <a id="l4394"></a>deified by the names of Osiris Bacchus &amp; Hercules as above: &amp; therefore  Menes, Nitocris &amp; Mœris are to be placed after him.  They  reigned over All Egypt &amp; therefore are to be placed amongst  <a id="l4397"></a>the kings of that Monarchy.  And being added to the rest will make up the number of 22 kings counted from Amosis inclusively. Mœris is set down –  – – Amasis Psammiticus.</p>
<p id="par518">While the Shepherds reigned at Abaris over the lower AEgypt, that <a id="l4398"></a>part of Ægypt anciently called Misraim was called also Aeria I think from the capi<a id="l4399"></a>tal city Abaris or  (Αούαρις) by a small corruption of the name,   <a id="l4401"></a> And Herodotus tells us that Thebais was anciently called <a id="l4402"></a> Ægypt. But after the <a id="l4403"></a>expulsion of the shepherds the name of Ægypt (Aiam Copti) was extended to the whole.  Whence <a id="l4404"></a>its probable that the kings of Coptos conquered all  Thebais <a id="l4405"></a></p>

<p id="par538">But  about the end of that Monarchy [when the argument <a id="l4507"></a>about genealogies &amp; successions of kings was pretty well exhausted] the <a id="l4508"></a>Greeks began to affect a more artificial sort of Chronology.   ffor <a id="l4509"></a>hitherto they  computed by no Æra but now began to  <a id="l4510"></a>use the Olympiads &amp; set down the lengh of every kings reign.

It seems the  Greeks had no ancient Æra, for this author uses none but reccons upwards <a id="l4517"></a>from his own  He sets down but a few of the more principal periods of time. And in the next Olympiad Timæus a very learned <a id="l4518"></a> author wrote a History in several books   down to his own time according to the Olympiads comparing <a id="l4519"></a>the Ephori the Kings of  Sparta, the Archons of Athens &amp; the <a id="l4520"></a>Priestesses of Argos with the Olympic victors,  so as to make all things suit with <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> according <a id="l4521"></a>to the best of his judgment &amp; where he left off Polybius began &amp; carri<a id="l4522"></a>ed on the History.

Euphemus was one of the Argonauts &amp; his  17 successors seem to be reconed by the reign of so many kings. ffor some cities of Greece preserved  <a id="l4552"></a>the names of their kings for many successions,  as in the instances abovementioned And the Greeks in the days of Pindar,  in recconing times <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p074r"> &lt;74r&gt; </span>  past took such successions for so many generations the fathers being usually succeeded by their sons.

Now Herodotus tells us <a id="l4612"></a>that  Homer &amp; Hesiod lived not above 400 years before <a id="l4613"></a>him.  Herodotus flourished in the 84<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. Count 400 years <a id="l4614"></a>backwards &amp; Homer will flourish not above 67 years before the <a id="l4615"></a>Olympiads, that is about  140 years after the death of <a id="l4616"></a>Solomon or about 60 or 70 years after the Trojan war.</p>

For Hercules is Chus,  <a id="l4711"></a>Osiris is Misraim,  Antæus is Phut &amp; Busiris is Canaan as <a id="l4712"></a>I find by other records compared with this.  So then with this division begins the brazen age.</p>
<p id="par565"> Now this was an age of discord  &amp; war, as Hesiod <a id="l4715"></a>&amp; Ovid  write, tho not  with so much <a id="l4716"></a>injury &amp; cruelty  as  the next.  For in this  age arose the <a id="l4717"></a>war between the Gods &amp; Gyants.  The manner was as follows.  Misraim <a id="l4718"></a> had vitiated  Maia the daughter of Phut &amp; on her begotten Thoth. <a id="l4719"></a>To revenge this injury Phut  treacher<a id="l4720"></a>ously drowns Misraim in the river Nile &amp; invades the <a id="l4721"></a>possessions of his posterity, &amp; thereupon they flee &amp; call Chus to <a id="l4722"></a>their assistance &amp; the two parties fight with clubs with <a id="l4723"></a>various success. ffor this is that war of which <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n96-ref">[96]</sup> Hyginus thus speaks:  Afri et Ægyptij primum fustibus dimicaverunt, postea Belus Neptuni filius gladio belligeratus est: unde bellum dictum. And from this flight of the Egyptians arose the fable of the flight of the Gods . ffor Phut &amp; his sons Otus Ophialtes &amp; the rest,  are sometimes represented  severally by Giants, sometimes collectively by one Gyant with 50 heads &amp; an hundred hands.   At length Thoth on whose account this war <a id="l4724"></a>arose  acting the part of  a mediator or embassa<a id="l4725"></a>dor between them composed the  difference by an agree<a id="l4726"></a>ment that Phut should live at a distance.  And hence <a id="l4727"></a>Thoth, whom we call Mercury is said to reconcile two <a id="l4728"></a>fighting serpents by casting his rod between them.  Chus <a id="l4729"></a>therefore carried Phut  as far as the western <a id="l4730"></a>Ocean &amp;  there in memory of this journey  <a id="l4731"></a>erected the pillars called Hercules's pillars. //And now <a id="l4732"></a>the war being ended, Isis the wife of Misraim  by <a id="l4733"></a>the advice of Mercury governed  the whole family <a id="l4734"></a>as Queen &amp; instituted  an annual commemoration of <a id="l4735"></a>the death of her husband by certain rites  of seeking his scattered limbs with lamentations &amp; drowning an ox, which rites at length <a id="l4736"></a> became a part of the religion of the Egyptians. <a id="l4737"></a>And this kind of worship being at  length propagated <a id="l4738"></a>into some other countries was applied by the Assyrians <a id="l4739"></a>to their Gods Venus &amp; Adonis with some alteration of <a id="l4740"></a>the   fable to suit it to those Gods.</p>

<p id="par654"> (which is according to the course of nature) the  fourten reigns of <a id="l5238"></a> the kings   of Alba which preceded the building of Troy  may amount to about 280 <a id="l5239"></a>years &amp; these years  counted from the  taking of Troy  end in the 37<sup>th</sup> Olymp. <a id="l5240"></a>And the seven kings of Rome, , at about  17 years <a id="l5241"></a> a piece (for five of these seven kings were slain &amp; one deposed) may amount to <a id="l5242"></a> 119 years which counted backwards fom the Regifuge &amp; the beginning <a id="l5243"></a>of the Consuls will end in the same 37<sup>th</sup> Olympiad &amp; there place the building of Rome</p>
<p id="par655" class="i0">– by ages they meant Reigns of the kings of the Latines at Alba, &amp; recconed the first <a id="l5244"></a>fourteen reigns at about 432 years &amp; the following reigns of – – – – too long for <a id="l5245"></a>the course of nature.   And by this recconing they placed  the building of Rome upon  the sixt or seventh Olympiad.  Varro placed it in the first <a id="l5247"></a>year of the seventh Olympiad &amp; was therein generally followed by the Romans.  But <a id="l5248"></a>this can scarce be true.  ffor I do not meet with any instance in all  history since <a id="l5249"></a>Chronology was certain, wherein seven kings (most of which were slain) reigned  244 <a id="l5250"></a>years in continual succession.   The fourteen reigns of the kings of the Latines at 20 years a piece one with <a id="l5251"></a>another amount unto 280 years, &amp; these years counted from the taking of Troy end in <a id="l5252"></a>the 38<sup>th</sup> Olympiad.  And the seven Reigns of the kings of Rome, five of them being <a id="l5253"></a> slain &amp; a sixt deposed, may at a moderate recconing  amount to 14 or 16 <a id="l5254"></a>years a piece one with another.  Let them be recconed at 17 years a piece &amp; they <a id="l5255"></a>will amount to 119 years  which counted backward from the Regifuge will end in the <a id="l5256"></a>38 Olympiad.  And by these two recconings Rome was built  in the 38 Olym<a id="l5257"></a>piad or thereabout.  The whole time of one &amp; twenty reigns <a id="l5258"></a>at 19 years a piece amounts to 399 years.  And these years  counted backward from the Regifuge  places <a id="l5260"></a>the taking of Troy 74 years after the death of Solomon. / The 280 &amp; the <a id="l5261"></a> 119 years together make up 399 years <a id="l5262"></a> the whole time between the taking of Troy &amp; the  regifuge. And the same number of years arises by computing the 21 reigns at 19 years a piece. Let these years be <a id="l5263"></a>counted backwards from the regifuge  &amp; they will place the taking of Troy about 74 years <a id="l5264"></a>after the death of Solomon. And</p>
<p id="par656">The five reigns following viz<sup>t</sup> those of Samedon, Sicyon, Polybus, Ianiscus, Phæstus <a id="l5265"></a>Adrastus, after the rate of 18 years  a piece take up 90 years &amp; end 65 years after the <a id="l5266"></a> death of Solomon, &amp; then reigned /  <a id="l5267"></a>And the next king Lamedon was contemporary to Pelops. / Ac/ Sicyon was the son of Pelops <a id="l5268"></a>as Pausanias reports from Ibicus, Adrastus reigned at  Sicyon in the time of the first <a id="l5269"></a> warr against Thebes</p>

<p id="par690"> Bochart shews [that the Curetes were a colony <a id="l5320"></a>of the Philistim  &amp;] that the Philistims were called Crethim by the <a id="l5321"></a>Hebrews &amp; their country Creth, &amp; that the Curetes were a colony of <a id="l5322"></a>  the Philistims &amp; had their name from thence.  And Eusebius <a id="l5323"></a>tells us that Crete had its name from Cres one of the Curetes who nursed <a id="l5324"></a>up Iupiter.  Whence  its probable that when the Edomites fled from <a id="l5325"></a>David  &amp; mixed with the Philistims, &amp; the Philistims by their assistance &amp; skill in sea <a id="l5326"></a>affairs took Sidon, &amp;  some of them went  thence to Crete with Europa &amp; her brother Atymnus  to seek new seats its probable I say that many of the Philistims were mixed <a id="l5328"></a>with this colony;  &amp; that thence came the name of the Curetes &amp; of the Island <a id="l5329"></a>Crete.  Some Egyptians might come to Crete in the days of Eli or Samuel; but <a id="l5330"></a>I meet with no account of them.</p>
<p id="par691">This fable of the four ages seems to have been formed by the Curetes in <a id="l5331"></a> the time of the fourth age.  These Curetes according to Bochart were Philistims. <a id="l5332"></a>He shews that the Philistims were by the Heberws Called Crethim or Cerethim <a id="l5333"></a>&amp; their country Creth, &amp; thinks that the Curetes &amp; the Island Crete had  <a id="l5334"></a>their names from thence.  And Eusebius saith that Crete had its name from <a id="l5335"></a>Cres, one of the Curetes who nursed up Iupiter.   Whatever was their original <a id="l5340"></a>they came into Asia minor &amp; Europe with the Phenicians of Sidon &amp; particular<a id="l5341"></a>ly into Crete with Europa &amp; her brother Atymnus   &amp; they measured  the first <a id="l5342"></a>four ages of their new world  by the reigns of the <a id="l5343"></a>first four kings of Crete, Asterius, Minos, Deucalion &amp; Idomeneus, giving the name of <a id="l5344"></a>the iron age to the age in which they lived, as Hesiod called the fift age the <a id="l5345"></a>iron age because he lived <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>in<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> it. And because they came into Europe about the time of <a id="l5346"></a>Deucalions flood, they seem to have feigned that the world perished by that flood, &amp;  was restored <a id="l5347"></a>by Deucalion &amp; Pyrrha throwing stones over their heads  to produce new men &amp; weomen <a id="l5348"></a> in the beginning of their <a id="l5349"></a>golden age.  This age therefore began about the 16<sup>th</sup> or 18<sup>th</sup> year of David.  And <a id="l5350"></a>about thirty years after when Minos was grown up  began the silver age <a id="l5351"></a>[&amp; upon his death began the  brazen age which lasted till the Argonautic expedition: for <a id="l5352"></a>Deucalion the son of Minos was in that expedition.] His son Deucalion was in the Argonautic expedition <a id="l5353"></a>&amp; his grandson Idomeneus warred at Troy.] Whatever was their original they came with the Phenicians <a id="l5354"></a>from Sidon into   Asia minor &amp; Europe  &amp; particular<a id="l5355"></a>ly into Crete  under Europa &amp; her brother Atymnus about the time of <a id="l5356"></a>Deucalions flood, &amp; measured the first four ages of their new world by the <a id="l5357"></a>reigns of their first four kings of Crete, Asterius the husband of Europa <a id="l5358"></a>the Saturn of the Latines; Minos her son  the Iupiter nursed up by the Curetes, who was celebrated for justice &amp; in whose days the Greeks began to plow &amp; sow &amp; whose sepulchre <a id="l5359"></a>they shewed as the sepulchre of Iupiter, Deucalion his son who reigned till <a id="l5360"></a>the Argonautic expedition &amp; Idomeneus his grandson who warred at Troy.  So then <a id="l5361"></a>Deucalions flood was about the 16<sup>th</sup> year of  David. [At that time Lycaon died <a id="l5362"></a>&amp; [his youngest son Oenotrus went soon after into Italy.] &amp; Hellen the son of Deu<a id="l5363"></a>calion began his reign in Thessaly] At that time the reign of Hellen the son of <a id="l5364"></a>Deucalion began in Thessaly, &amp; that of Lycaon ended in Arcadia, Canaus then reigned in Attica &amp; soon after was succeeded by Amphictyon the predecessor of <a id="l5366"></a>Erechtheus.</p>
<p id="par692">– till the birth of his grandson Arcas &amp; some years after.</p>
<p id="par693">Herodotus tells us that the Phœnicians who came with Cadmus – &amp; Idome<a id="l5367"></a>neus his grandson warred at Troy.

<p id="par708">Asserhadon corruptly called Sarchedon by Tobit (ch. I.21) <a id="l5503"></a>&amp; Assardin by the Seventy reigned at Nineveh in the year of Nabonassar 34 &amp; at Babylon in the year of Nabonassar 68, &amp; then peopled Samaria with captives <a id="l5504"></a>brought from several parts of Assyria, the Dinaites, the <a id="l5505"></a>Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, <a id="l5506"></a>the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, the Elamites <a id="l5507"></a>(Ezra IV.2, 9) &amp; therefore reigned over all these nations.  Pekah <a id="l5508"></a>&amp; Rezin kings of Samaria &amp; Damascus invaded Iudea in <a id="l5509"></a>the first or second year of Ahaz, &amp; within 65 years after, <a id="l5510"></a>that is in the 21<sup>th</sup> or 22<sup>th</sup> of Manasseh, Samaria ceased to be <a id="l5511"></a>a people,  (Isa. VII.8) viz<sup>t</sup> by carrying the remainder of  <a id="l5512"></a>Samaria into captivity &amp; placing these nations in their room.  <a id="l5513"></a>Then he invaded Iudea, took Azot, carried Manasses captive to Ba<a id="l5514"></a>bylon, &amp; captivated also Egypt Thebais &amp; Ethiopia above Thebais, <a id="l5515"></a>&amp; by this war he seems to have put an end to the reign of the <a id="l5516"></a>Ethiopians over Egypt, anno Nabonass.  77 or 78.</p>
<p id="par709">In the reigns of Sennacherib &amp; Asserhadon the Assyrian <a id="l5517"></a>Empire seems arrived at its greatness, being united under one <a id="l5518"></a>Monarch &amp; conteining  Assyria, Media, Apolloniatis, Susiana, <a id="l5519"></a>Chaldæa, Mesopotamia, Cilicia, Syria, Phœnicia, Egypt, Ethiopia <a id="l5520"></a>&amp; part of Arabia, &amp; reaching eastward into Elymais &amp; Paræ<a id="l5521"></a>tacene.  For Strabo reccons these two among the Provinces to <a id="l5522"></a>which the Monarchy had given the name of Assyria, &amp; <a id="l5523"></a>Herodotus makes Parætacene a Province of the Medes. And <a id="l5524"></a>if Chalach &amp; Habor where Salmanasser placed part of the <a id="l5525"></a>ten Tribes be Colchos &amp; Iberia (as some think &amp; as is probable from the circumcision  used in these nations in the days of Herodotus) we are also to <a id="l5526"></a>add these two Provinces with the two Armenias Pontus &amp; Cap<a id="l5527"></a>padocia, as far as the river Halys. For Herodotus tells us that <a id="l5528"></a>the people of Cappadocia as far as to that river were called <a id="l5529"></a>Syrians by the Greeks both before &amp; after the days of Cyrus.</p>
<p id="par710">Yet the Medes revolted from the Assyrians in the <a id="l5530"></a>latter end of the reign of the reign of Sennacherib, I think upon the slaughter <a id="l5531"></a>of his army neare Egypt &amp; his flight to Nineveh. ffor at <a id="l5532"></a>that time the estate of Sennacherib was troubled so that <a id="l5533"></a>Tobit could not go into Media as he had done before (Tobit I <a id="l5534"></a>15) And sometime after Tobit advised his Son to go into Media <a id="l5535"></a>where he might expect peace while Nineveh, according to the prophesy <a id="l5536"></a>of Ionah, should be destroyed. Ctesias wrote that Arbaces a <a id="l5537"></a>Mede being admitted to see Sardanapalus in his palace, &amp; ob<a id="l5538"></a>serving his voluptuous life amongst weomen, revolted with the <a id="l5539"></a>Medes &amp; in conjunction with Belesis a Babylonian overcame <a id="l5540"></a>him &amp; caused him to set fire to his Palace &amp; burn himself: <a id="l5541"></a>But he is contradicted by other Authors of better credit. For <a id="l5542"></a> Duris <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n121-ref">[121]</sup> &amp; many others wrote that Arbaces <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p095r"> &lt;95r&gt; </span> upon being admitted into the Palace of Sardanapalus &amp; <a id="l5543"></a>seing his effeminate life slew himself, or perhaps was slain.  <a id="l5544"></a>And Cleitarchus<sup class="note" id="n122-ref">[122]</sup> that Sardanapalus died of old age after he had <a id="l5545"></a>lost his dominion over Syria, suppose by the revolt of the western nations. And Herodotus that <a id="l5546"></a>the Medes revolted first &amp; defended their liberty by force of <a id="l5547"></a>arms against the Assyrians without conquering them, &amp; <a id="l5548"></a>at their first revolting had no king but after some <a id="l5549"></a>time set up Dejoces over them &amp; built Ecbatane for his <a id="l5550"></a>residence &amp; that Dejoces reigned only over Media &amp; had <a id="l5551"></a>a peaceable reign, but his son &amp; successor Phraortes made <a id="l5552"></a>war upon his neighbours &amp; invaded the Assyrians but was slain <a id="l5553"></a>by them in that war, &amp; that the Syrians also &amp; other western <a id="l5554"></a>nations at length revolted from the Assyrians being encou<a id="l5555"></a>raged thereunto by the example of the Medes, who ac<a id="l5556"></a>cording to Herodotus were the first of the conquered nations <a id="l5557"></a>that revolted.</p>
<p id="par711">Now Asserhadon seems to be the Sardanapalus who died <a id="l5558"></a>of old age after the revolt of Syria, the name Sardanapalus <a id="l5559"></a>being derived from Asser-hadon-pul, &amp; his fathers  Anacyndaraxis, Cyndaraxis or Anabaxaris being corruptly written  for Sennacherib.  Sardanap.  built Tarsus &amp; Anchiale in <a id="l5562"></a>one day &amp; therefore reigned over Cilicia before the <a id="l5563"></a>revolt of the western nations. And if he be Asserhadon <a id="l5564"></a>he was succeeded  by Saosduchinus in the year of <a id="l5565"></a>Nabonassar 81. And by this revolution Manasses was <a id="l5566"></a>set at liberty to return home &amp; fortify Ierusalem. <a id="l5567"></a>And the Egyptians also after the Assyrians had  reigned <a id="l5568"></a>three years over them (Isa. XX.3, 4) were set at liberty <a id="l5569"></a>&amp; created twelve contemporary kings over themselves as <a id="l5570"></a>above.  The Scythians of Touron or Turquestan beyond the river Oxus began in those days to infest Persia, &amp; by one of their inrodes might give occasion to the revolt of the western nations.</p>
<p id="par712">In the year of Nabonassar 101  Saosduchinus was succeeded at Babylon <a id="l5571"></a>by Chyniladan &amp; I think at Nineveh by that Nebuchadonosor who <a id="l5572"></a>is mentioned in the book of Iudith.  For the history of that king suits <a id="l5573"></a>best with these times. For there it is said that Nebuchadonosor king of <a id="l5574"></a>the Assyrians who reigned at Nineveh that great city, in the twelft <a id="l5575"></a>year of his reign, made war upon Arphaxad king of the Medes <a id="l5576"></a>&amp; was then left alone by a defection of the auxiliary nations <a id="l5577"></a>of Cilicia, Damascus, Syria,  Phœnicia, Moab Ammon &amp; Egypt, &amp; with<a id="l5578"></a>out their help routed the army of the Medes &amp; slew Arphaxad. And <a id="l5579"></a>Arphaxad is there said to have built Ecbatane &amp; therefore <a id="l5580"></a>was either Dejoces or his son Phraortes who might finish the <a id="l5581"></a>city founded by his father. And Herodotus tells  the same story <a id="l5582"></a>of a king of Assyria who routed the Medes &amp; slew their king <a id="l5583"></a>Phraortes, &amp; saith that in the time of this war the Assyrians <a id="l5584"></a>were left alone by the defection of the auxiliary nations being <a id="l5585"></a>otherwise in good condition.  Arphaxad was therefore the Phraortes <a id="l5586"></a>of Herodotus, &amp; by consequence was slain neare the beginning of the <a id="l5587"></a>reign of Iosiah – For this war was made after  Phœnicia, Moab, Ammon &amp; Egypt had been conquered &amp; <a id="l5589"></a>revolted (Iudeth I.7, 8, 9.) &amp; by consequence after the reign of Asser<a id="l5590"></a>hadon who conquered them.

This was in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l5603"></a>Hezekiah &amp; therefore  the king of Egypt on whom Hezekiah trusted <a id="l5604"></a>(<span class="hspac-n" title="10 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) was Sethon, &amp; Senacherib  made war upon them both <a id="l5605"></a>as confederates against him &amp; besieged Libnah that is Pelusium at the same time <a id="l5606"></a>that he sent Rashakeh against Hezekiah, &amp; Tirhakah the successor <a id="l5607"></a>of Sabacon in the kingdom of Ethiopia came down with an army <a id="l5608"></a>of Ethiopians  to assist  Sethon &amp; in conjunction with the Egypti<a id="l5609"></a>ans slew 185000 Assyrians &amp; put the king of Assyria to flight. <a id="l5610"></a>This victory being in the 33<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonassar makes it probable <a id="l5611"></a>that Sabacon invaded Egypt  about the beginning of the reign of <a id="l5612"></a>Nabonassar &amp; that some Egyptians flying then from  Sabacon carried the Egyp<a id="l5613"></a>tian year to Babylon &amp; founded that Æra.  ffor the <a id="l5614"></a>years of Nabonassar are Ægyptian.</p>
<p id="par714">In the  4<sup>th</sup> <a id="l5615"></a>year of Hezekiah, Salmanassar beseiged Samaria becau<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>se<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l5616"></a>Hoshea had conspired with Sua king of Egypt &amp;  paid no tribute <a id="l5617"></a>the year before as he used to do year by year, &amp; therefore Sua <a id="l5618"></a>was king of Egypt in the 3<sup>d</sup> year of Hezekiah. Sabacon, Sabachus, <a id="l5619"></a>Sabah, Sua are the same. Africanus places Sevechus   after Sabacus but these are also <a id="l5621"></a>the same.</p>
<p id="par715">Tirhakah after this victory over the Assyrians became a conside<a id="l5622"></a>rable conqueror. Strabo calling him Tearco, saith that he went <a id="l5623"></a>into Europe &amp; as far as the straits mouth.</p>
<p id="par716">After these kings reigned Stephinates Niecepsos &amp; Nechus the <a id="l5624"></a> father of Psammiticus. Herodotus saith that Sabacon slew Nechus &amp; put his son Psammiticus to flight. But this was done rather by the Assyrians the  invasion of Egypt by Sabacon being long before <a id="l5627"></a>the days of Psammiticus. Nicepsos with one Petosiris is reputed the <a id="l5628"></a>inventor of Iudicial Astrology &amp; the first that wrote the art of <a id="l5629"></a>predicting by the starrs. And from Ægypt the study of Astrology went into Chaldæa. Iulius Firmicus calls him Ægypti potentissi<a id="l5630"></a>mum Imperatorem.</p>
<p id="par717">At this time Ægypt was divided into two or more kingdomes.  <a id="l5631"></a>One kingdom was at Memphys another at Tanis or Zoan &amp; perhaps a <a id="l5632"></a>third at Sais.   the two first are mentioned by Isaias <a id="l5633"></a>I will set, saith he, the Egyptians – – – – – shall serve the Assyrians.</p>
<p id="par718">In the days of these kingdoms Asserhadon king of Assyria <a id="l5634"></a>invaded Iudea &amp; carried Manasses captive to Babylon 2 Chron. 33.11 &amp; Isa 19.24, 25. This conquest was therefore after Asserhadon became king of <a id="l5635"></a>Babylon, that is, after the year of Nabonassar 67. The Iews say <a id="l5636"></a>that Manasseh was captivated in the 22<sup>th</sup> year of his reign, that is <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p096v"> &lt;96v&gt; </span> in the year of Nabonassar 71. Then  Asserhadon sent Tartan <a id="l5637"></a>against Ashdod or  Azot a town of Palestine neare Egypt &amp; he <a id="l5638"></a>took it &amp; afterwards the Assyrians invaded  conquered &amp; capti<a id="l5639"></a>vated Egypt &amp; Ethiopia, Isa 20.  But the dominion of the Assyri<a id="l5640"></a>ans over Egypt lasted only two or three years.  Diodorus calls it an <a id="l5641"></a>anarchy of two years. Isaias represents it by his going naked &amp; bare<a id="l5642"></a>foot three years.  The Lord said – – – – – – almost ever since in servitude</p>
<p id="par719">In the 12<sup>t</sup> year of Darius Nothus – – – – – At that time Artaxer<a id="l5643"></a>xes Ochus carried away all the records – – – – – years in that interval.</p>

<p id="par720">The first great kingdom in the world seems to have been that of <a id="l5644"></a>Egypt.  For Pliny – – – – Nineveh &amp; Ecbatane.</p>
<p id="par721">Ægypt is a long &amp; narrow tract of land – – – Lord of both <a id="l5645"></a>Thebais &amp; Egypt.  This was the original of that <a id="l5646"></a>monarchy out of four smaller kingdoms, but how those arose <a id="l5647"></a>out of smaller is harde to relate by reason of the great antiquity of <a id="l5648"></a> the kingdoms. Yet some footsteps there are of their first   original.</p>
<p id="par722">For in the seven years of plenty – – –  Δήμοι of Greece. </p>
<p id="par723">Now these cities were at first free  absolute &amp; independent</p>
<p id="par724">The manner how the first  cities of Egypt grew <a id="l5649"></a>into kingdoms will be best understood by the constitution of  <a id="l5650"></a>the kingdom of Athens.  ffor the Athenians were a colony of Egypt <a id="l5651"></a>– – – – – – – – – &amp; by consequence that the Egyptian  Cities <a id="l5652"></a>in time of war convened in common councils to consult of their common <a id="l5653"></a>safety &amp; solemnized those councils with great sacrifices &amp; festivals for <a id="l5654"></a> assembling the people &amp; by means of those Councils grew into king<a id="l5655"></a>doms the captains of their armies becoming their kings much after <a id="l5656"></a>the manner of the Cities of Attica in the reigns of Cecrops Amphictyon &amp; <a id="l5657"></a>Theseus.</p>
<p id="par725">The occasion of the Egyptians growing from free cities into <a id="l5658"></a>kingdoms so early seems to be the incursions of the Sheepherds or <a id="l5659"></a>Arabians – – – – – – before the days of Iacob. For to these <a id="l5660"></a>enemies the new king of Egypt  who <a id="l5661"></a>rose after the death of Ioseph &amp; his brethren seems to have had <a id="l5662"></a>respect when he said Behold &amp;c – – – – for a long time together.</p>
<p id="par726">Artaphanus tells us that Palmonothes king of Egypt was the <a id="l5663"></a>first that built a Temple in the lower Egypt &amp; that he built <a id="l5664"></a>one at Heliopolis the Metropolis of that kingdom. Also that his <a id="l5665"></a>daughter Merrhis was married to one Chenephres king of a region <a id="l5666"></a>above Memphis.  <em class="underline">For then</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">Egypt had many kings</em>. He adds <a id="l5667"></a>that this daughter was shee that educated Moses &amp; that Moses found <a id="l5668"></a>out the arts &amp; philosophy of the Egyptians &amp; divided the kingdom into <a id="l5669"></a>36 Nomi or  governments &amp; assigned to each their rites of worshipping <a id="l5670"></a>the deity &amp; the sacred letters. <em class="underline">Which he did to that end that he <a id="l5671"></a>might render the Monarchy firm to Chenephres: because before that <a id="l5672"></a>time the multitude not being reduced into distinct order did sometimes <a id="l5673"></a>eject &amp; sometimes create kings &amp; often the same but sometimes others</em> <a id="l5674"></a>By all which he got the love of the people &amp; was honoured by the <a id="l5675"></a>Priests with the name of Hermes or Mercury. Here Artaphanus being <a id="l5676"></a>a Christian ascribes some things to Moses which do not well agree to <a id="l5677"></a>him, but yet he lets us understand that the kingdoms of Egypt were <a id="l5678"></a>at first like those of Greece, many in number &amp; free fom Tyranny, <a id="l5679"></a>the people placing &amp; displacing their kings that is the captains <a id="l5680"></a>of their armies till the government was  new modelled &amp; <a id="l5681"></a>reduced into the 36 Nomi &amp; that this regulation was as old as the <a id="l5682"></a>first Temple in the lower Egypt  Whence I gather that it was older then the <a id="l5683"></a>Pyramids whose very accurate &amp; magnificent structures shew that  architecture <a id="l5684"></a>was then grown to a good degree of perfection,  &amp; that the first <a id="l5685"></a>Egyptians worshipped only on Altars without Temples like the Patriarchs <a id="l5686"></a>&amp; the Persians in their Prytanea, untill their cities began to assemble in <a id="l5687"></a>common councils &amp; at their common charges for the use of those councils  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p097v"> &lt;97v&gt; </span> 
erected Temples.  where the Councills met as the Greeks  did after<a id="l5688"></a>wards in  imitation <a id="l5689"></a>of the Egyptians, &amp; the Latines in imitation of the Greeks. He lets <a id="l5690"></a>us understand also that the Egyptians attributed this regulation of <a id="l5691"></a>their government to  him whom they accounted the author of <a id="l5692"></a>their arts &amp; sacred rites &amp; letters &amp; whom their Priests honoured <a id="l5693"></a>by the name of Mercury or Hermes,  that is to Thoth <a id="l5695"></a>whom some would have to be Moses or Ioseph, but who was really <a id="l5696"></a>an Egyptian &amp; reigned in Egypt soon after the days of Osiris &amp; Isis.  <a id="l5697"></a>And indeed it is not at all improbable that Thoth who had seen Egypt <a id="l5698"></a> afflicted &amp; almost oppressed by two great &amp; very danger<a id="l5699"></a>ous wars  &amp; by whose council they were saved from  ruin <a id="l5700"></a>in them both, should consult how to strengthen his Egyptians against <a id="l5701"></a>their enemies for the future. He who by his policy had armed their last enemies <a id="l5702"></a>with iron weapons &amp; sent them against the eastern people to <a id="l5703"></a>divert them from Egypt, would scarce fail afterwards to arm his own <a id="l5704"></a>Egyptians &amp; take care that they should be trained up in the use <a id="l5705"></a>of their arms, for which end it would be requisite that they should <a id="l5706"></a>meet together at times appointed. While he saw Egypt divided <a id="l5707"></a> amongst the families of the Sons of Misraim &amp; every <a id="l5708"></a>family daily dividing &amp; subdividing into several cities it was obvious <a id="l5709"></a>for so great a politician to consider how to unite &amp; strengthen <a id="l5710"></a>them by common councils.  He that was  by all <a id="l5711"></a>antiquity reputed the author of merchandise  <a id="l5712"></a>was most probably the author of conventions for merchandising <a id="l5713"></a>ffor what else means his being reputed the God of publick ways <a id="l5714"></a>but that he was the first who contrived the free communication between <a id="l5715"></a>the cities of Egypt for uniting them in a good corespondence with <a id="l5716"></a>one another, &amp; assembling them upon set occasions.  And to whom <a id="l5717"></a>can we better ascribe the  sacred rites &amp; solemnities of the several  Nomi of Egypt in their solemn feasts then to him who contrived the figures <a id="l5719"></a>&amp; solemnities of their Gods &amp; in particular instituted the sacred rites &amp; ffestivals of Osiris &amp; Isis which <a id="l5720"></a>were observed  all the Egyptians? ffor he was their great legislator <a id="l5721"></a>both in things civil &amp; sacred, &amp; no man ever had a greater <a id="l5722"></a>authority among them. Isis is indeed recconed their first  Law-maker, but shee  governed them by his counsil, &amp; the Egyptians were so <a id="l5724"></a>retentive of his institutions that it was difficult for  following kings <a id="l5725"></a>to alter them. [Every Nomus had its proper God [&amp; every God his <a id="l5726"></a> proper worship &amp; therefore  <a id="l5727"></a>the division of Egypt into Nomi was as ancient as the worship of those Gods] &amp; worshipped]</p>

<p id="par727">And whilst in the first ages they placed &amp; displaced their kings <a id="l5728"></a>at pleasure which could not well be done without  assembling together, it is to be conceived that they were originally free &amp; <a id="l5729"></a>absolute cities &amp;  upon the rise of wars whether <a id="l5730"></a>among one another or against the shepherds their common enemy  <a id="l5731"></a> convened in common Councils to raise armies &amp;  place or displace captains <a id="l5732"></a>over them as they saw occasion, untill their Captains  grew potent over <a id="l5734"></a>the people after the manner of the ancient kings of Greece &amp; <a id="l5735"></a>this was before the days of Ioseph.  ffor  the King of Egypt <a id="l5736"></a>was then grown so potent as to  say to Ioseph. <em class="underline">According to thy word shall all my <a id="l5737"></a>people be ruled – I am Pharaoh &amp; without thee shall no man lift <a id="l5738"></a>up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt</em>.

That is he new modelled <a id="l5742"></a>the government for  establishing the dominion of Pharaoh &amp; for that <a id="l5743"></a>end  either formed or  new regulated the  division of the Land into  the Provinces called the Nomi &amp; removed  the  people from <a id="l5746"></a> one city <a id="l5747"></a>to another for breaking their interests peopling the head cities of the Nomi &amp; bring the <a id="l5748"></a>whole land into  a more regular subjection then before.</p>
<p id="par728" class="i0">– &amp; reduced into Nomi,  that the Egyptians attributed this  regulation of their <a id="l5749"></a>government to him whom they accounted the author of their  arts &amp; <a id="l5750"></a>sacred rites &amp; letters  &amp; whom the Priests honoured by the name of Mer<a id="l5751"></a>cury, &amp; that this regulation  began with the building of  the first Temples in the head cities of the Nomi. From whence I seem to gather these two things. ffirst, that this regulation <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>was<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> ancienter then the Pyramids;   whose very accurate <a id="l5753"></a>&amp; magnificent structures  argue that architecture was grown  in Egypt <a id="l5754"></a>to  a great degree of perfection before they were built.  And secondly that the  Egyptians originally worship<a id="l5756"></a>ped  on altars only without Temples such as were <a id="l5757"></a>the Prytanea of the Persians &amp;  built their first Temples at the common charge <a id="l5758"></a>&amp; for the common worship of  several cities when &amp; where they <a id="l5759"></a>first began to convene in common Councils, as  the Greeks &amp; Latines also did. <a id="l5760"></a></p>
<p id="par729">Plutarch tells us that One of the Kings of Egypt for establishing <a id="l5761"></a>his dominion divided the land into  various religions according to <a id="l5762"></a> the number of the Nomi,  so that by their differences of religion <a id="l5763"></a>they might be hindred from conspiring against their kings. But whilst <a id="l5764"></a>I meet not with any instances of a king setting up more religions than <a id="l5765"></a>one in his  kingdom,  it seems more probable that the  diversity of <a id="l5766"></a>religions in Egypt arose from the diversity of kingdoms there in the first <a id="l5767"></a>ages,  as it did in all other places. ffor in Syria &amp; the <a id="l5768"></a>neighbouring regions  several kingdoms had their several Gods &amp; every kingdom <a id="l5769"></a>trusted in his own God  in opposition to the Gods of the neighbouring  kingdoms as we shewed above.</p>

<p id="par749">By all these things it may be understood that when David conquered <a id="l5944"></a>the Edomites &amp; made them &amp; their neighbours upon the red sea fly to <a id="l5945"></a>other places, some fled into Ægypt &amp; there set on foot Navigation Astronomy &amp; <a id="l5946"></a>Letters.

And when Zidon was taken &amp; the <a id="l5952"></a>Zidonians fled from the Philistims, some of them fled to Tyre,  Ara<a id="l5953"></a>dus, &amp; the sea coasts of Cilicia Asia minor Crete &amp; Greece under Abibalus <a id="l5954"></a>Cadmus, Cilix, Theseus <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> other Captains &amp; carried thither Letters, navigation &amp; the working <a id="l5955"></a>in minerals &amp; gave the name of Phanice to Cana. But the Tyrians were not yet heard of in Europe. They <a id="l5956"></a>being chiefly such as had fled from Sidon were enemies to the <a id="l5957"></a>Philistims &amp; friends to David For Hiram <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n123-ref">[123]</sup> was always a lover of David. And  by their skill in navigation &amp; <a id="l5958"></a>their mixture with Edomites &amp; Midianites who had knowledge of the red sea they assisted Solomon &amp; his successors &amp; perhaps David also in <a id="l5959"></a>setting on foot &amp; carrying on their trade on that sea untill the revolt of the Edomites <a id="l5960"></a>from Ioram king of Iudah.

And at the same time Dido  fled from her brother <a id="l5964"></a>Pigmaleon to the coast of Afric &amp; built Carthage. And this was <a id="l5965"></a>  presently <a id="l5966"></a>after the taking of Troy while Æneas  &amp; Teucere were yet alive, <a id="l5967"></a>Carthage (according to the records of that city) being built <a id="l5968"></a>737 before the Romans destroyed it. And by these things you <a id="l5969"></a>may understand the meaning of the tradition which Herodotus ascri<a id="l5970"></a>bes in the beginning of his first book to the Persians &amp; in the middle of his 7<sup>th</sup> book to the <a id="l5971"></a>Phenicians themselves:  viz<sup>t</sup> that <a id="l5974"></a>the Phenicians came from the red sea to the sea coasts of  Phœnicia &amp;  presently undertook long voiages upon the mediterranean viz<sup>t</sup> first under the Zidonians who went as far as Greece &amp; Libya &amp; then under the Tyrians who went to the  mouth of the straits &amp; beyond. And these <a id="l5976"></a>things being setled, it remains now that I touch upon the anti<a id="l5977"></a>quities of Greece contemporary to these  things, that the  chronology of <a id="l5978"></a>the whole may appear.</p>
<p id="par750">When Sesostris returned into Egypt – – – one generation <a id="l5979"></a>earlier.</p>
<p id="par751">I have now carried up the Chronology of Greece as high <a id="l5980"></a>as to the four first ages of the Gods of Greece &amp; the flood of <a id="l5981"></a>Deucalion which immediatly preceded them. The flood of Ogyges <a id="l5982"></a>might be two or three generations earlier, but the things done in <a id="l5983"></a>that interval are very obscure</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p103r"> &lt;103r&gt; </span>
<p id="par752" class="i0"> And such an occa<a id="l5992"></a>sion there was in Davids reign in an  extraordinary manner. ffor David <a id="l5993"></a>beat the Philistims in many battels &amp; conquered his neighbours round about &amp;  brought the monar<a id="l5994"></a>chy of Israel to  its height before the <a id="l5995"></a>birth of Solomon &amp; made his enemies fly from their seats as appears <a id="l5996"></a>by the flight of the Edomites into Egypt. Rehoboam the eldest son of Solomon was 41 years old when he began to reign &amp; therefore he was born a year before the death of David. If at that time Solomon may be supposed  above 20  &amp; under 26 years old he will have been born  after the 13<sup>th</sup> &amp; before the 19<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign &amp; at a middle recconin</p>
<p id="par753">Altho the Greeks &amp; Latines had no certain Chronology ancienter <a id="l5997"></a>then the Persian Monarchy, yet the Phenicians had Annals as ancient as <a id="l5998"></a>the days of David. And Tatian an Assyrian, in his book against the <a id="l5999"></a>Greeks relates that amongst the Phœnicians flourished three ancient <a id="l6000"></a>historians Theodotus Hypsicrates &amp; Mochus &amp;c – – – – should record it <a id="l6001"></a>but Agenors losing his daughter &amp; sending his sons with a great body <a id="l6002"></a>of people to  find her or return no more <a id="l6003"></a>affected them. For Lucian tells us that the Sidonians built a <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible because the manuscript is faded">{illeg}</span> <a id="l6004"></a>&amp; thence we may be certain that the rapture of Europa  &amp; expedition of Cadmus could not happen  260 <a id="l6007"></a>years before the building of  Solomons Temple  as Chronologers <a id="l6008"></a>reccon,  but suits perfectly with the reign of David where we have placed it. Thus by the authority of the <a id="l6011"></a>Phenician Annals &amp; Histories which were much older then any  annals &amp; <a id="l6012"></a>histories of the Greeks,  <a id="l6016"></a>the age of Cadmus &amp; Europa is fixed, &amp; thereby the times of the <a id="l6017"></a>Argonautic expedition, Trojan war &amp; Return of the Heraclides <a id="l6018"></a>are also fixed, the intervals being limited by the  genealogies of Cadmus <a id="l6019"></a>Europa &amp; Hercules.  And having thus by the genealogies &amp; reigns <a id="l6020"></a>of Kings, by the Precession of the Equinox by the  synchronisms of the actions of the Greeks &amp; Oriental nations &amp; by the authority of the <a id="l6021"></a>oldest &amp; surest  records fixed these times:  we cannot err <a id="l6023"></a>much in determining the rest.  ffor Cadmus was the first who <a id="l6024"></a>brought letters into Europe &amp;  things done in Europe <a id="l6025"></a>could not be remembered  above three or four generations before <a id="l6026"></a>the use of Letters, &amp; therefore we have already brought chronology almost as <a id="l6027"></a>high as the first memory of things.</p>
<p id="par754">Polydorus the son of Cadmus – –  – – – under age to succeed him.</p>
<p id="par755">Erechtheus an eminent king of Athens had several sons Cecrops, Pandion – – <a id="l6028"></a>– – &amp; in the beginning of Solomons.  Homer ✝<sup class="note" id="n124-ref">[124]</sup> calls him the son of the <a id="l6029"></a>earth nurst up by Pallas &amp; Diodorus saith he was an Egyptian, &amp; that in a time of famin he procured a great <a id="l6030"></a>quantity of corn from Egypt, &amp; for this benefaction the people of Athens <a id="l6031"></a>made him their king &amp; therefore he did not inherit his fathers kingdom <a id="l6032"></a>but succeeded  by right of Election.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p103v"> &lt;103v&gt; </span>
<p id="par756">Cecrops   who led a colony of Egyptians into Attica,  was expelled the kingdom by Cranaus his son in law &amp; Cranaus was the father of Rharus the father of Celeus king of Eleusis in the reign of <a id="l6035"></a>Erechtheus &amp; therefore Cecrops was almost three generations  or about <a id="l6036"></a>75 years older then Erechtheus, or  55 years older then David. He is <a id="l6037"></a>recconed one of the first Egyptians who led colonies into Greece. He was the first <a id="l6038"></a>that civilized the people of Attica &amp; gathered them into towns &amp; cities. <a id="l6039"></a>He joyned one man &amp; one woman &amp; first called Iupiter God &amp; set up an <a id="l6040"></a>altar at Athens &amp; after him came in  the whole genealogy of the Gods <a id="l6041"></a>of Greece.</p>


<p id="par759">When the Phenicians began to trade with Greece &amp; bring corn thither <a id="l6043"></a>out of  Egypt, they would be apt to bring weomen  out of Egypt to <a id="l6044"></a>teach the Greeks how to grind it &amp; make it into bread. And this I find done <a id="l6045"></a>in the days of Erechtheus. ffor at time Ceres is said to Athens. She pretended <a id="l6046"></a>to come in quest of her daughter – – – – – &amp; therefor Car was contempo<a id="l6047"></a>rary to Solomon &amp; Phoroneus to David. </p>
<p id="par760">Perseus was the father of Alcæus – – – – to grind corn.</p>

<p id="par762">After Lamedon above mentioned had reigned some years at Ægyale – <a id="l6048"></a> – – – – Danaus  &amp; his son Longinus &amp; daughters were younger then Perseus the grandson of Acrisius.  <a id="l6051"></a>being  scarce one generation older then the Argonauts as was shewed above. <a id="l6052"></a>And there</p>
<p id="par763" class="i0">Egyptians any more. Zerah is called an Ethiopian  <a id="l6053"></a>but that's no objection against his being king of Egypt for his successor Memnon <a id="l6054"></a>was also an Ethiopian. Libya was in those days a province of Egypt</p>
<p id="par764">They seem to have received it from the Phenicians &amp; in the beginning to have used the same Octaeteris in all Greece <a id="l6055"></a>&amp; Italy &amp; their Islands, allowing only a liberty to the Priests of  omitting a day  in the month <a id="l6056"></a>or a month in the Octaeteris as often as it should be found  requisite to make the months agree with the Moon &amp; the years with the sun,</p>
<p id="par765" class="i0">And if the Athenæa &amp; games of Minos were celebrated upon the first year of the Octaeteris  as is most <a id="l6057"></a>probable, the expedition of Theseus will be 24 years after the death of  Androgeus. ffor the <a id="l6058"></a>Athenians paid a tribute of Children three times, &amp; in the third payment Theseus put an end to this tribute. <a id="l6059"></a>Now supposing that  Androgeus &amp; the  children  paid for him by way of recompence were of about the  <a id="l6060"></a>same age  or that Androgeus &amp; Theseus were  beardles young men of about 20 years <a id="l6061"></a>of Age, &amp; since Theseus was born about 9 years before the death of Solomon the expedition of Theseus will happen about  11 years after the death of Solomon <a id="l6062"></a>&amp; the birth of Androgeus about the  7<sup>th </sup> year  of Solomons reign &amp; by con<a id="l6063"></a>sequence the birth of Minos  about the midle of <a id="l6064"></a>Davids reign, or within two or three years after.

But <a id="l6471"></a>he  inheritance For Nimrod being two generations older then Peleg, flourished at the division of the Earth into languages being a mighty hunter &amp; by making war upon wild Beasts  being enabled &amp; inclined to make war upon men,  &amp; by the goodness of <a id="l6473"></a>the soil invited to invade the lands of  Shinar &amp; Assyria, he erected a kingdom <a id="l6474"></a>there.  And this was at or presently after the division of the earth &amp; confusion of languages: ffor he was two <a id="l6475"></a>generations older then Peleg in whose days the earth was divided, &amp;  <a id="l6476"></a>this division &amp; confusion  was made by the hand of God  in opposition <a id="l6477"></a>to the designes of men.  Till then they lived together &amp; by conversing <a id="l6478"></a>with one another <em class="underline">the whole earth was of one language &amp; one speech <a id="l6479"></a>&amp; as they journied together</em> (suppose in tents) <em class="underline">they found a plane in the land of Shinar <a id="l6480"></a>&amp; they dwelt there &amp; built the city Babylon &amp; a Tower whose top <a id="l6481"></a>might reach unto heaven, to make themselves a name &amp; prevent their <a id="l6482"></a>being scattered abroad upon the face of the earth</em>; that is, they built a <a id="l6483"></a>tower so high that  in seeking <a id="l6484"></a>for food for themselves &amp; their  cattel they might see the <a id="l6485"></a>same from all parts of the great plane of the land of Shinar &amp; know <a id="l6486"></a>whether to resort least they should be scattered fom their main body. <a id="l6487"></a><em class="underline">But  the Lord came down to see the city &amp; tower &amp; said, The people is one <a id="l6488"></a>&amp; they have all one language; &amp; this they have begun to do: &amp; now <a id="l6489"></a>nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do. Go to, <a id="l6490"></a>let us go down &amp; there confound their language that they may not understand <a id="l6491"></a>one  anothers speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all  the earth: &amp; they left off to build the city</em>. That is, by the  counsel of God they were forced to <a id="l6494"></a>leave the City Babel &amp; the fruitful land of Shinar to Nimrod &amp; were scattered from <a id="l6495"></a>thence abroad to seek new seats going in several bodies to several parts of <a id="l6496"></a>the earth according to their tribes &amp; families, &amp;  there building new cities <a id="l6497"></a>&amp; becoming various nations tongues &amp; langauges, ffor <em class="underline">the beginning of Nimrod's kingdom was Babel</em>.

And while he seated himself in this land his brethren the other <a id="l6500"></a>sons of Chus seated themselves in all the coasts of the Persian Gulf &amp; in Arabia  <a id="l6501"></a>The other sons of Ham went towards Egypt &amp; Canaan &amp; Afric. The sons of Iaphet toward Asia <a id="l6502"></a>minor &amp; the sons of Sem  (viz<sup>t</sup> Elam &amp; Asshur &amp; Arphaxad &amp; Lud &amp; Aram &amp; his sons) seated <a id="l6503"></a>themselves in  Elymais &amp; Assyria &amp; Araphachitis above Assyria &amp;  Mesopotamia Syria <a id="l6504"></a>&amp; Armenia. But Nimrod invaded Assyria &amp; there built Nineve &amp; Rehoboth <a id="l6505"></a>&amp; Calah the metropolis of Calachene &amp; Resen (le Resen, Larissam) <a id="l6506"></a>between Nineveh &amp; Calah.

<p id="par840">For before the days of Peleg the grandfather of Serug the whole <a id="l6508"></a>earth was of one language &amp; of one speech, &amp; as they journeyed from <a id="l6509"></a>the east (suppose in Tents) they found a plane in the land of Shinar &amp; they <a id="l6510"></a>dwelt there &amp;  made bricks &amp; built the city Babel with its tower <a id="l6511"></a>to make to themselves a name least they should be scattered abroad upon <a id="l6512"></a>the face of the whole earth (Gen 10.25 &amp; 11.1, 2, 3, 4.) that is the sons of <a id="l6513"></a>Noah hitherto lived together as one society  &amp; one body  politick &amp; by conversing <a id="l6514"></a>together  had but one language &amp; built the city Babel as the seat &amp; habitation of their society from which they would not wander, <a id="l6516"></a>&amp; there also they built a high Tower whose top might reach unto  <a id="l6517"></a>heaven that while they wandred in the fields seeking for food for them <a id="l6518"></a>selves &amp; their cattel they might  see the tower from all parts <a id="l6519"></a>&amp; thereby know whether to resort.</p>
<p id="par841">And while they thus lived together or were but newly divided Nimrod the grandson of Noah <a id="l6520"></a>being two generations older then Peleg,  began to <a id="l6521"></a>be a mighty one in the earth, Gen 10.8 that is he  began to reign over them. <a id="l6522"></a>ffor he was a mighty hunter before the Lord &amp; by conquering wild beasts became able to conquer men  And the beginning of his kingdom was <a id="l6525"></a>Babel (the city which they first built for the seat of their society) &amp; Erech or <a id="l6526"></a>Arecca &amp; Accad or Archad &amp; Calneh, cities built afterwards in the land of Shinar  when  men began to spread abroad upon the face of the earth. And when <a id="l6528"></a>he had built these cities he went out of the land of Shinar into Assyria <a id="l6529"></a>&amp; built the cities Nineveh &amp; Rehoboth &amp; Calah (the metropolis of Cala<a id="l6530"></a>cene) &amp; Resen ( le Resen, Larissam)  a great city between <a id="l6531"></a>Nineveh &amp; Calah. Thus makind began to spread upon the face of the <a id="l6532"></a>earth  building cities in such places as were  well watered <a id="l6533"></a>&amp; fertil. And after the death of Nimrod his sons &amp; grandsons <a id="l6534"></a>&amp;  other great men  reigning  under him in the <a id="l6535"></a>several cities which he had built  inherited the cities in which they reigned.  it being the custom in the first ages for all the <a id="l6538"></a>children to share the fathers territories as we explained above. And <a id="l6539"></a>this division  of his kingdom might give a beginning to the variety of languages <a id="l6540"></a>mankind from thence forward spreading more  &amp;more upon the face of <a id="l6541"></a>the earth &amp; remote kingdoms for want of  conversation varying from one <a id="l6542"></a>another  in their modes of speaking.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p112r"> &lt;112r&gt; </span>
<p id="par842">As the first kings of the Greeks who founded or greatly enlarged <a id="l6543"></a>their cities &amp; kingdoms were honoured after death  by their  <a id="l6544"></a>successors &amp; friends as benefactors &amp; had  sepulchres erected to them in <a id="l6545"></a>the form of  magnificent houses or Temples with  statues over their <a id="l6546"></a>graves or tumbs to represent them &amp; Altars &amp; Priests to perform pious <a id="l6547"></a>ceremonies anually &amp; sometimes monthly weekly or daily upon the Altars for perpetuating their <a id="l6548"></a>memory; all which gave a beginning to the Idolatrous religion of the <a id="l6549"></a>Nations of Greece: so it is to be conceived that the Idolatry of the <a id="l6550"></a>Egyptians,  Phœnicians Assyrians &amp; Chaldeans had its rise from the like honour <a id="l6551"></a>paid after death to the  founders of the cities &amp; kingdoms  of those countries; &amp; by consequence that the <a id="l6554"></a>building of towns began in those countries  a little before the rise of idolatry <a id="l6556"></a> And therefore since  the <a id="l6558"></a>Chaldeans were idolaters before the days of Abraham &amp; <a id="l6559"></a>drove out Abraham because he would not worship <a id="l6560"></a>their Gods (Iosh. 24.2. Iudith. 5.6, 7) &amp; since Laban the grand<a id="l6561"></a>son of Nahor the brother of  Abraham worshipped images (Gen 31.30) <a id="l6562"></a>&amp;  Nahor  &amp; his father Terah were Idolaters (Ios. 24.2) &amp; Terah,  made Images or statues of Earth  &amp; proposed <a id="l6564"></a>them to be worshipped as Gods (<span class="hspac-n" title="15 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) that <a id="l6565"></a> is, to be set up in the Temples over the Tumbs of the <a id="l6566"></a>dead where the people worshipped them.  Some say that <a id="l6567"></a>Idolatry began in the days of Serug the grandfather <a id="l6568"></a>of Terah. <span class="hspac-n" title="20 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whence the building of cities &amp; erecting of Kingdoms might begin two or three generations before For In the days of <a id="l6569"></a> Peleg the grandfather of  Serug the earth was <a id="l6570"></a>divided,  &amp; scattered abroad that is separated into several  <a id="l6573"></a>nations languages &amp; kingdoms,  &amp; began to build <a id="l6574"></a>several cities,  the people having  built Babel <a id="l6575"></a>&amp; its tower for their common seat  before they became divided <a id="l6576"></a>into more  languages &amp; kingdoms then one &amp; by that means having learnt the manner of building cities.</p>
<p id="par843">By this recconing  mankind began to be scattered over the <a id="l6577"></a>face of the earth &amp; build cities in several places of N almost two hundred years <a id="l6578"></a>before the birth of Abraham. At that time the thirteen sons <a id="l6579"></a>of Ioctan the brother of Peleg began to dwell from Mesha as thou <a id="l6580"></a>goest unto Sephar a mountain of the east ( Gen. 10.26)  which is to <a id="l6581"></a>be understood of their dwelling  in cities. And at that <a id="l6582"></a>time also Nimrod seems to have erected a kingdom at Babel <a id="l6583"></a>supose by conquering the kingdom which built Babel for a Metropolis &amp; reigned there till the division <a id="l6584"></a>of languages.  For he reigned first over Babel &amp; Erech &amp; Accad <a id="l6585"></a>&amp; Calneh  principal cities in the land of  Shinar, &amp; <a id="l6586"></a>went into Assyria &amp; there built Nineveh &amp; Rehoboth &amp; Calah &amp; <a id="l6587"></a>Resen principal cities of Assyria, &amp; therefore he reigned presently after <a id="l6588"></a>the division of  the kingdom of Babel into various cities nations &amp; languages.</p>

And first I shall <a id="l6702"></a>state the history of the Iews under Zerubbabel in the reign of <a id="l6703"></a>Cyrus Cambyses &amp; Darius Hystaspis.</p>
<p id="par866">This History as conteined partly in the three first chapters <a id="l6704"></a>of the book of Ezra &amp; first five verses of the fourth &amp;c – –<br><br></p>
<p id="par867" class="i0">Darius began his reign in spring An I.P. 4193 &amp; reigned 36 years by the unanimous consent <a id="l6705"></a>of all Chronologers.  In the 2<sup>d</sup> year of his reign the Iews  began to build the tem<a id="l6706"></a>ple by the prophesying of Haggai &amp; Zech. &amp; finished it in the sixt year.  Darius fought the Greeks at Marathon in Octob an. I.P. 4224 <a id="l6708"></a>ten years before the battel of Salamis &amp; died in the 5<sup>t</sup> year following. The years of Cambyses &amp; Darius are determined by three  eclipses of the Moon so that they cannot be disputed, &amp; by those eclipses &amp; the Prohesies of Hag. &amp; Zech compared together its manifest that his years began after the 24<sup>th</sup> day of the 11<sup>th</sup> Iewish month &amp; before the 25<sup>t</sup> day of April  &amp; by consequence in March or April.</p>
<p id="par868">Xerxes spent the first five years of his reign &amp; something more in preparations <a id="l6709"></a>for his expedition against the Greeks &amp; this expedition was in the time of the Olympic <a id="l6710"></a>games an 1 Olymp 75 Calliade Athenis Archonte [28 years after the Regifuge &amp; <a id="l6711"></a>Consulship of the first Consul Iunius Brut ann] as all Chronologers agree. The passage <a id="l6712"></a>of his army  over the Hellespont began in the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> year of the 74<sup>th</sup> Olympi<a id="l6713"></a>ad (that is in Iune an I.P. 4234 &amp; took up a month &amp; in autumn after 3 months <a id="l6714"></a>more die Munichionis 16 Plenilunio was the battel at Salamis &amp; a little after that an Eclips of the Moon which by <a id="l6715"></a>the calculation fell on Octob. 2. His first year therefore began in spring an I.P. <a id="l6716"></a>4229.  He reigned almost 21 years by the  consent of all writers <a id="l6717"></a>[&amp;  to his reign agrees the story of Hester &amp; Mordecay.] &amp; was succeeded by Ar</p>
<p id="par869">Artabanus reigned seven months &amp; upon suspicion of treason against Xerxes was <a id="l6718"></a>slain  by Artaxerxes Longimanus the son of Xerxes an. I.P. 4250. <a id="l6719"></a>He &amp;  Xerxes together reigned some months above 21 years &amp; by consequence <a id="l6720"></a>he was slain an I.P. 4250 in the autumnal half year </p>
<p id="par870">Artaxerxes reigned – – – – year following, &amp; therefore began his reign in Autumn an I.<a id="l6721"></a>P. 4250 <br><br></p>
<p id="par871">I have now stated the history of the Iews in the reign of Cyrus <a id="l6722"></a>Cambyses &amp; Darius Hystaspis. It remains that I state their history in <a id="l6723"></a>the reigns of Xerxes &amp; Artaxerxes Longimanus. For I place the <a id="l6724"></a>histories of Ezra &amp; Nehemiah</p>

<p id="par873">Troy was taken about 80 years before the return of <a id="l6735"></a>the Heraclides into Peloponnesus, &amp; by consequence about <a id="l6736"></a>131 years before the first Olympiad, or 75 years <a id="l6737"></a>after the death of Solomon; And the Argonautic expe<a id="l6738"></a>dition being one generation earlier was about 43 years <a id="l6739"></a>after the death of that king: as was collected above <a id="l6740"></a>by arguments taken from Astronomy.

<p id="par874">And the truth of these things will be further confirmed when it shall appear <a id="l6755"></a>that the Greeks  collected the time of the return of the <a id="l6756"></a>Heraclides into Peloponesus, from the number of kings reigning in Sparta  <a id="l6757"></a>after that return  by recconing the reigns of kings  at about <a id="l6758"></a>35 or 45 years a piece one with another, which is  double to their length by the course of nature <a id="l6759"></a>[;  And they will  be still further confirmed when it shall apear that   Sesostris was Sesac &amp; <a id="l6760"></a>invaded Greece one generation before the Argonauic expedition, &amp; returned out of <a id="l6761"></a>Greece into Egypt in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam; &amp; that upon his return his brother Danaus <a id="l6762"></a>immediately fled from him into Greece with his 50 daughters  in a long ship  after the pattern of which the  ship Argo was built by his grandson;  And that the <a id="l6768"></a>distraction of Egypt by the invasion of the Ethiopians &amp; victory of Asa  &amp; insurrection of Osarsiphus gave occasion to the Argonautic expedition: And that Cadmus fled <a id="l6770"></a>from Sidon to Greece upon the taking of Sidon by the Philistims &amp; Edomites in the reign of David. </p>

<div class="lg"><p class="l">The third from him was Cyrus a happy man.</p></div>
<p id="par911" class="i0">The Poet here attributes the founding of the Medo-Persian Empire to the two  <a id="l6978"></a> Predecessors of Cyrus,  the first of which was a Mede <a id="l6979"></a>&amp; the second was his son. The second was Darius the Mede the immediate <a id="l6980"></a>predecessor of Cyrus according to Daniel &amp; therefore the first was  Assuerus, Oxyares, Axeres or Cy-Axeres.  ffor Daniel tells us that Darius was the son <a id="l6982"></a>of Achsuerus (or Ahasuerus as the Masorets called him) of the seed (or royal family) of the Medes.  This is that <a id="l6983"></a>Assuerus who together with Nebuchadnezzar took &amp; destroyed Nineve according to Tobit, which action is by the Greeks ascribed to Cyaxeres. By <a id="l6984"></a>this victory over  the Assyrians at Nineveh &amp; subversion of their kingdom <a id="l6985"></a>he began to erect the Medo-Persian  Empire &amp; his son Darius the Mede <a id="l6986"></a>finished the work by conquering the kingdoms of Lydia &amp; Babylon, &amp; the <a id="l6987"></a>third king was Cyrus a happy man for his great successes under Darius &amp; large <a id="l6988"></a>dominion in his own reign.   <a id="l6992"></a> This Cyaxeres  according to Xenophon was the son of Astyages king of the Medes &amp;   Astyages according to both Xenophon &amp; Herodotus gave his daughter <a id="l6997"></a>Mandane to Cambyses a Prince of Persia &amp;  <a id="l6999"></a>  Cyaxeres the son of Astyages &amp; brother of Mandane according to Xenophon gave his daughter to Cyrus the son of Cambyses &amp; Mandane.  Xenophon tells us that she was reported to be very handsome &amp; that Cyrus used to play with <a id="l7001"></a>her in his childhood  &amp; that she then used to say that she would marry Cyrus: whence I <a id="l7002"></a>gather that Cyrus was of the same age with the Children of Cyaxeres  &amp; married  his daughter not after <a id="l7004"></a>the taking of Babylon when she would have been an old woman but  long before while she was  young &amp; beautiful &amp; Cyrus a young man, &amp; that she was  of a just age <a id="l7006"></a>to be the sister of Darius the Mede.  For Cyrus lived 70 years (according to Tully) &amp; took Babylon nine years before his death (according to Ptolomys Canon)  that is, at the age of 61 years: at which time Darius was 62 years old acording to Daniel.  From all which compared together <a id="l7007"></a> we may certainly conclude that these four kings Astyages, Cyaxeres, Darius <a id="l7008"></a>&amp; Cyrus reigned successively over the Medes. Herodotus seems to invert the order <a id="l7009"></a>of the kings  Astyages &amp; Cyaxeres,  for he tells us that <a id="l7010"></a>Cyaxeres the father  of Astyages was  more warlike then his predecessors <a id="l7011"></a>&amp; brought the army  of the Medes into better order &amp; discipline  <a id="l7012"></a>&amp; subdued the Scythians &amp; Assyrians: all which answers the character which Æschylus <a id="l7013"></a>gives to that king of the Medes who reigned next but one before Cyrus, <a id="l7014"></a> &amp; so confirms my opinion that the kings of the Medes reigned in this <a id="l7015"></a>order Dejoces, Phraortes, Astyages, Cyaxeres, Darius, Cyrus &amp;c, </p>
<p id="par912">How Dejoces  the first king built Ecbatane &amp;  extended the kingdom <a id="l7016"></a>westward through Armenia into Cappadocia as far as the river Halys &amp; how Phraortes <a id="l7017"></a>conquered the Persians (not all the nations now called Persia but a Province thereof) &amp; invaded the Assyrians &amp; was slain by them we have told <a id="l7018"></a>you above. Astyages did nothing memorable. In his reign a great body of <a id="l7019"></a>Scythians commanded by Madyes invaded Media, beat the Medes in <a id="l7020"></a>battel &amp; brought them into subjection &amp; going thence towards Egypt <a id="l7021"></a>were met in Phœnicia &amp; bought off by Psammiticus,</p>
<p id="par913">When therefore the Angel told Daniel that he would return to fight with the king of Persia <a id="l7022"></a>for when he was gone out the Prince of Greece should come &amp; that in the first year of Darius <a id="l7023"></a>he stood to confirm &amp; to strengthen him: the meaning is that he was to assist the king of Greece in warring against the Persians as he had assisted Darius in  warring <a id="l7024"></a>against the Chaldeans,  .</p>
<p id="par914">The Persians being conquered by the Medes about the middle of the reign of Zedekiah being conquered by the Medes, <a id="l7025"></a>continued still in subjection under them , &amp; Cyrus who was of the royal family of the Persians <a id="l7026"></a>was not yet an absolute &amp; independant king. But after the taking of Babylon when <a id="l7027"></a>he had  a victorious army at his devotion, it was easy for him to revolt.</p>
<p id="par915">This victory was about 2 years after the taking of  Babylon. ffor the reign of Novo<a id="l7028"></a>nidus the last king of the Chaldees whom Daniel calls Belshazzar ended in the year <a id="l7029"></a>of Nabonassar 210, nine years before the death of Cyrus; according to the Canon, <a id="l7030"></a>but after the  translation of the kingdom of the Medes to the Persians, Cyrus reigned <a id="l7031"></a>only seven years according to Xenophon, &amp; spending  –– – – 212, An.

<p id="par918" class="i0">The predecessor of Cyrus (according to Daniel) was Darius the son of Achsuerus <a id="l7037"></a>(or Ahasuerus as the Masorets call him) of the seed of the Medes that  is of the <a id="l7038"></a> seed royal: &amp; therefore his father Achsuerus that is Oxyares <a id="l7039"></a>Astibares, Axeres,  or Cy-Axeres) was that Mede who first had the <a id="l7040"></a>army of the Medes &amp; by  conquering founded the Empire.  Cyrus lived 70 years according to Cicero <a id="l7053"></a>&amp; reigned nine years over Babylon according to Ptolomy's Canon &amp; therefore <a id="l7054"></a>was 61 years old at the taking of Babylon, at which time Darius the Mede <a id="l7055"></a>was 62 years old according to Daniel &amp; therefore Darius was two generations <a id="l7056"></a>younger then Astyages. ffor Astyages by the common consent of Herodotus <a id="l7057"></a>&amp; Xenophon gave his daughter Mandane to Cambyses a Prince of Persia <a id="l7058"></a>&amp; by them became the grandfather of Cyrus. And  Cyaxeres the <a id="l7059"></a>son of Astyages (according to Xenophon) gave his daughter to Cyrus. This <a id="l7060"></a>daughter saith Xenophon was reported to be very handsome &amp; used to play with Cyrus <a id="l7061"></a>when they were both Children &amp; to say that she would marry him: &amp; <a id="l7062"></a>therefore Cyrus &amp; Darius were one generation younger then Cyaxeres. So <a id="l7063"></a>then these kings reigned in order Astyages Cyaxeres Darius &amp;  Cyrus. Astyages did nothing glorius. Cyaxeres (as Herodotus tells us)    was more warlike then any of his Predecessors &amp;  was the first who  brought the confused army of <a id="l7065"></a>the Medes into  order &amp; discipline.  He slew the Scythians who <a id="l7066"></a>had invaded Media. He conquered westward as far as the river Halys &amp; <a id="l7067"></a>after a war of five years with Alyattes king of Lydia he fought the Lydians <a id="l7068"></a>in the time of a total Eclips  of the Sun predicted by Thales, &amp; after<a id="l7069"></a>wards he &amp; Nebuchadnezzar overthrew the Assyrian monarchy  seated <a id="l7070"></a>at Nineveh.  He was therefore the first who led the army in setting up <a id="l7071"></a>the Monarchy of the Medes as Æschylus describes.  The next,  his son Darius,  by conquering <a id="l7072"></a>the kingdoms of Lydia &amp; Babylon, finished the work.  The third from him was Cyrus a <a id="l7073"></a>happy man for his victories both under Darius &amp; in his own reign.</p>

Amos 9.7.

The meaning seems to be that for his skill in minerals &amp; <a id="l7118"></a>excocting metals out of them he was sent by Sesostris to preside over <a id="l7119"></a>the Ægyptians &amp; Philistims  who were placed in Captor at the foot of Mount <a id="l7120"></a>Caucasus, &amp; there  to imploy the  Philistims as slaves in digging those mountains for gold &amp; silver. <a id="l7121"></a> For that country  was  in those days <a id="l7122"></a>celebrated for its riches in gold &amp; silver dug out of those mountains.

He placed on his mothers statue <a id="l7138"></a>three Crowns to signify that she was the daughter wife &amp; mother <a id="l7139"></a>of a king.  Manetho saith that he was the son &amp; successor of Rhampses who <a id="l7140"></a>was the eldest son &amp; successor of Sethos or Sesostris.  And perhaps Rhampses (if that was the name of the father of Amenophis) was the son of  Sesostris by an Ethiopian woman. ffor the Greeks always recconed Memnon an Ethiopian. Iosephus tells us <a id="l7143"></a>out of Manetho that this Amenophis  was a contemplator of <a id="l7144"></a>the Gods as was Orus  a former king &amp; was perswaded <a id="l7145"></a>by one of the Priests to purge Egypt from leprous &amp; impure men &amp; <a id="l7146"></a>for that end gathered them out of all Egypt &amp; granted them <a id="l7147"></a> Abaris the city of Typhon to inhabit. <a id="l7148"></a>Whereupon they conceiving this a fit place to make a rebellion <a id="l7149"></a>made Osarsiphus Priest of Heliopolis their captain &amp; fortified <a id="l7150"></a>their cities &amp; prepared for war against Amenophis, &amp; called <a id="l7151"></a>in the Iews from Ierusalem who came to Pelusium with an army of 200000 <a id="l7152"></a>to their assistance.

But after 13 years Amenophis <a id="l7161"></a>came out of Ethiopia with a great army &amp; his son Ramesses <a id="l7162"></a>joyned him with another great army &amp; they fought the shepherds <a id="l7163"></a>&amp; polluted people &amp;  drove them out of Egypt pursuing them as <a id="l7164"></a>far as the borders of Syria. And the same story is told by Cheræmon <a id="l7165"></a>with some variation of circumstances. Let the story be purged from the <a id="l7166"></a> mistake that Osarsiphus was Moses &amp; from the calumny that the Egypti<a id="l7167"></a>ans who called in the Iews were leaprous &amp; it will run thus: that <a id="l7168"></a>Memnon being an Ethiopian  was either the same man with Zerah or his king or warred  under him in the army of  Ethiopians &amp; Libyans  who  <a id="l7170"></a> invaded Iudea; <a id="l7172"></a>that this army being beaten  by the Iews at Maresah, a body of Egyptians <a id="l7173"></a>soon after revolted from the Ethiopians at Pelusium &amp;  made Osarsiphus their captain <a id="l7174"></a>&amp;  called in the victorious Iews to <a id="l7175"></a>their assistance; that Memnon led the Ethiopians against Osarsi<a id="l7176"></a>phus   He <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>retired<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> into Thebais &amp; Ethiopia  &amp; <a id="l7178"></a> &amp; in the mean time built &amp; fortified Memphys to stop the progress of the Enemy &amp; then returned back to that city without venturing  a second battel against the Iews &amp; from thence retired  sent for a body of Ethiopians from  Indiæ by sea to strengthen himself &amp; gave them seats above Egypt. For this Eusebius insinuates in telling us: Sub Amenophe Æiopes ab Indo flumine consurgentes juxta Ægyptum consederunt. That after thirteen years he returned with what force he &amp; his young son  Ramesses could make &amp; conquering Osarsiphus drave <a id="l7180"></a> out the Iews.  And to this action Ramesses seems to <a id="l7181"></a>relate when he inscribed on his Obelisk (as Hermapion interpreted <a id="l7182"></a>it) that he had saved Egypt by expelling forreigners. </p>
<p id="par929">Manetho  says that the shepherds obteined Egypt 511 <a id="l7186"></a>years.  If the Iews  (whom Manetho takes to be the Shepherds) entered Egypt a year or two after <a id="l7187"></a>the battel at Maresah &amp;  Amenophis after another year or two retired into Thebais &amp; Ethiopia &amp; reigned there 13 years before he returned back against Osarsiphus the last <a id="l7188"></a>expulsion of the shepherds will be about the 30<sup>th</sup> or 33<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l7189"></a>Asa.

<p id="par935">It was the general opinion of  antiquity that Sesostris  lived before <a id="l7211"></a>Memnon &amp; before the times of the Trojan war &amp; that Memnon lived in the times of that <a id="l7212"></a>war  ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 128v &gt; </span> ✝ Homer speaks of Thebes as in its glory &amp; greatness with 100 Gates &amp; 20000 Chariots <a id="l7213"></a>&amp; immense riches in the time of the Trojan war &amp; this description could not agree <a id="l7214"></a>to Thebes before the days of Sesostris.  Hesiod makes Memnon to be the son of Tithonus &amp; <a id="l7216"></a>Aurora; which Tithonus, saith Diodorus, <em class="underline">was the son of Laomedon &amp; brother of <a id="l7217"></a>Priamus, &amp; warring in the eastern parts went as far as Ethiopia</em> (that is <a id="l7218"></a>was carried captive by Sesostris into Thebais) <em class="underline">whence came the fable of <a id="l7219"></a>Memnon's being born of Aurora</em>. Memnon was therefore one generation <a id="l7220"></a>younger then Tithonus &amp; Priamus, &amp; by consequence contemporary to the  <a id="l7221"></a>children of Priam &amp; to the Trojan war. And this synchronism is confirmed by <a id="l7222"></a>its giving occasion to a story related by Pindar Pausanias  Diodorus &amp; other ancients of Memnons being at the war of Troy &amp; there slain by Achilles <a id="l7224"></a>the Greeks taking occasion from the Synchronism to frame this story in honour of <a id="l7225"></a>their nation. And thus far the story seems to be true that about the time of that <a id="l7226"></a>war or  a very little before he came into Phrygia, not to assist the Trojans, but in carrying on his conquests, <a id="l7227"></a>Pausanias relates that in a publick building at Delphos – – – then made their weapons <a id="l7228"></a>  From all these things  compared it seems that  Sesostris invaded  Asia &amp; Grece in the days of Laomedon king <a id="l7230"></a>of Troy &amp;  amongst a great multitude of captives carried away his son Tithonus a beautiful youth, Priamus  being not yet <a id="l7231"></a>grown up. That  Memnon was born soon after  (that is soon after the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam) &amp; therefore feigned by the <a id="l7232"></a>Greeks to be the son of Tithonus.

<p id="par936">And by this recconing the dstruction of Troy was about 60 or 65 <a id="l7235"></a>years after the death of Solomon, counting about 15 years to the birth <a id="l7236"></a>of Memnon &amp; 45 or 50 more to the taking of that city.</p>
<p id="par937">If in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam when Tithonus was captivated he <a id="l7237"></a>&amp; Priam may be supposed about 20 years old, &amp; when Troy was taken <a id="l7238"></a>Priam being an old man, may be supposed about 70 years old the difference <a id="l7239"></a>of about 50 years  added to 14 will make 64 years.</p>

<p id="par950">ffor in the</p>
<p id="par951">At first the nations  destitute of Astronomy &amp; Arithmetic determined the lengths of months <a id="l7343"></a>&amp; years not by any certain number of days or other astronomical rules but by the visible returns of the sun <a id="l7344"></a>Moon &amp; stars &amp; seasons of the year, afterwards – – – – – &amp; therefore it may be <a id="l7345"></a>accounted as old as those religions &amp; festivals &amp; by consequence brought into Greece <a id="l7346"></a>by  the first Phenicians &amp; Egyptians who sailed  thither, such as were <a id="l7347"></a>Cadmus &amp; Cecrops.

But in doing these things the Greeks <a id="l7352"></a>received light from the Egyptians ffor Strabo tells us that Eudoxus – – – Chaldeans.</p>
<p id="par953">The Egyptians were therefore the first who  found out the  true length <a id="l7353"></a>of the year.

<p id="par954" class="i0">The filling 360 milk-bowles in the sepulchre of Osiris are a plain indication that the solar year at the time of that <a id="l7359"></a>institution was reputed  to consist of no more then 360 days. The five additional <a id="l7360"></a>days were  reputed the birth days of Osiris Isis <a id="l7361"></a>&amp; while they tell us that  when Rhea was with <a id="l7362"></a>child by Saturn or  according to Diodorus, when Iupiter was with <a id="l7363"></a>child by Iuno  these 5 days were added that their children  might be born in  no part of the old year <a id="l7365"></a>&amp; then Iuno brought forth Osiris Isis Typhon &amp;c on these five days:  <a id="l7366"></a>this emendation of the year is ascribed to Ammon the father of Osiris &amp; Isis. But I had rather trust the <a id="l7367"></a>monuments of the milk bowls &amp; the golden  border  circle &amp; ascribe it to  the younger  Ammon or Amenophis whom the <a id="l7368"></a>Greeks call Memnon, &amp; the year it self of 365 days points at him for the author.</p>

Thus far <a id="l7433"></a>Hesiod. By the ages its plain that he means  ages of mans life  <a id="l7434"></a>&amp; therefore he himself lived  <a id="l7435"></a>within 30 or 40 or at most 50 or 60 years after the war of Troy.

There were four ages of the Gods of Egypt ~ ~ reigning at Thebes, the first was of Saturn who expelled the shepherds <a id="l7438"></a>&amp; whom Mercury painted with two faces &amp; four wings doing this with respect to the times before &amp; after the expulsion of the shepherds, the second of Iupiter Ammon <a id="l7439"></a>the third of Osiris  &amp; the fourth of Orus  &amp; the  surviving  Gods. <a id="l7440"></a>The first was peaceable, the second  unquiet, the third very warlike the fourth <a id="l7441"></a>warlike troublesome &amp; miserable.

For the Sidonians built it for that purpose.  And this seems to have been <a id="l7532"></a>in the days of Hiram &amp; his father Abibalus  the first kings of Tyre named in history. Not later because Tyre grew great &amp; was built in their days as above nor much <a id="l7534"></a>sooner because Solomon in the beginning of his reign calls the servants of Hiram Zidonians:  <em class="underline">My servants shall be with thy servants &amp; unto thee I will give hire <a id="l7535"></a>for  thy servants according to all that thou desirest for thou knowest that <a id="l7536"></a>there is not  amongst us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the <a id="l7537"></a>Zidonians</em> 1 King. 5.6.

We may reccon therefore that the king of Ascalon <a id="l7541"></a> took Sidon in the reign of David or not long before. ffor then were the <a id="l7542"></a>Philistims  most  potent &amp; active in  invading their neighbours &amp; from the hostility between the Philistims <a id="l7543"></a>&amp; Sidonians it seems to have happened that David had friendship with the <a id="l7544"></a>king of Tyre while he made warr upon the Philistims. </p>

<p id="par1018">Pheron is by Herodotus called the son &amp; successor of Sesostris &amp; so sems <a id="l7756"></a>to be the same king with Orus, called Pharaoh or Pheron after his fathers <a id="l7757"></a>death. Pliny calls him Nuncorcus.</p>
<p id="par1019">Zerah reigned before the death of the Gods Isis Bubaste &amp; Thoth</p>
<p id="par1020">Proteus reigned in the lower Egypt when Paris sailed thither with Helena <a id="l7758"></a>that is 20 years before the taking of Troy &amp; so might be either Osarsiphus or a Viceroy. The <a id="l7759"></a>name Proteus signifies a Prince or President &amp; Herodotus tells us that it was the kings <a id="l7760"></a>name translated into Greek, &amp; that he rose up from among the common people <a id="l7761"></a>Conon calls him an Egyptian Prophet, that is, a Priest, &amp; Iosephus tells us <a id="l7762"></a>that Osarsiphus was Priest of Heliopolis. He revolted from Amenophis &amp; was <a id="l7763"></a>conquered by him.</p>
<p id="par1021">Amenophis reigned next after the Gods &amp; by conquering  Osarsiphus became <a id="l7764"></a>king of all Egypt &amp; built a palace at Abidus &amp; the Memnonia &amp; Susa By corruption of his name he is <a id="l7765"></a>called Masni Menes, Exephnes, Nenephes, Osimandes, Memnon, Arminon. After he had built <a id="l7766"></a> Memphys &amp; the Temple of Vulcan he was <a id="l7767"></a>succeeded by his son called by Herodotus Rhampsinitus &amp; by others Ramses, Rameses <a id="l7768"></a>Ramesses, Remphis, Rhampses. This king built the western portico of the <a id="l7769"></a>Temple of Vulcan, &amp; Mœris built the northern Portico thereof more sumptuously &amp; <a id="l7770"></a>therefore reigned after them both. He also made – – – – – Thuoris &amp;c.</p>
<p id="par1022">Diodorus places Vchoreus between Osimanduas &amp; Myris or <a id="l7771"></a>Memnon &amp; Mœris, &amp; says that – – – – corruption of the name. <a id="l7772"></a>We may reccon therefore that  Vchoreus translated the seat of the <a id="l7773"></a>kingdom from Thebes to Memphys, &amp; that he was either Mœris or his imme<a id="l7774"></a>diate predecessor.</p>
<p id="par1023">After the example of the two brick Pyramids made by Mœris <a id="l7775"></a>the next Kings Cheops, Chephren &amp; Mycerinus built three great Pyra<a id="l7776"></a>mids of Marble. Cheops is also called Chembis, Chemnis, Phiops, Phius, Suphis <a id="l7777"></a>Sanphis, Sipphoas, Siphaosis, Soiphis, Siphuris, Anoiphes, Anoysis, Apappus maximus. And Myce<a id="l7778"></a>rinus is called also Bicheres, Cervinus, Chœres, Moscheres, Mencheres. This king died <a id="l7779"></a>before the third Pyramid was finished &amp; his sister &amp; successor Nitocris finished it. <a id="l7780"></a>Then reigned Asychis who built the eastern Portico of the Temple of Vulcan <a id="l7781"></a>very splendidly, &amp; a large Pyramid of brick made of the mud dug out of the <a id="l7782"></a>Lake of Mœris. And these are the kings who reigned at Memphys &amp; spent <a id="l7783"></a>their time in adorning that city untill Egypt became again divided into many <a id="l7784"></a>small kingdoms. ffor Nitocris &amp; Asychis were succeeded at Thebes &amp; Memphys <a id="l7785"></a>by Gnephactus (otherwise called Neochabis, Nectabis &amp; Technates) &amp; his son <a id="l7786"></a>Boccharis, at Sais by Stephanates Nicepsus &amp; Nechus, at Tanis by Petu<a id="l7787"></a>bastes Osorchon Psammis &amp; Zet or Sethon &amp; at Anysis or Hanes (Isa. 30.4) by <a id="l7788"></a> Anysis or Amosis a blind man of that city. Herod. l. 2. And Egypt being weakened by this division was again invaded &amp; conquered by the Ethiopians under <a id="l7789"></a>Sabacon or Sabacus who slew Boccharis &amp; Nechus &amp; made Anysis fly.</p>
<p id="par1024">Isaias speaking of – – – – serve the Assyrians.</p>
<p id="par1025">Among the great works of the kings of Egypt were their Obelisks <a id="l7790"></a>And Pliny tells us that the first Obelisk was made by Mitres (that is Mephres) <a id="l7791"></a>who reigned in Heliopolis, &amp; afterwards other kings in the same city made <a id="l7792"></a>others, Sachis (that is, Sesochis or Sesak) four, each of 48 cubits in length <a id="l7793"></a>Ramises two, Smarres (that is Manus or Mœris one of 48, Eraphius <a id="l7794"></a>(or Hophara) one of 48 &amp; Nectabis one of 80.</p>

<p id="par1026"> And perhaps the conjecture is not  improbable that the names of Æthiopia &amp; Ægypt Αἰα Θηβων &amp; Αἰα Κοπτου might come <a id="l7795"></a>from the cities Thebes &amp; Coptus being once the royal  seats of two kingdoms,  ffor Αἰα-Θήβον &amp; Αἰα  Κόπτου signify the land of Thebes &amp; the land of Coptus. <a id="l7797"></a></p>
<p id="par1027">And perhaps the conjecture is not improbable that the names of <a id="l7804"></a>Æthiopia &amp; Ægyptus came originally from the cities Thebes &amp; Coptus being once the <a id="l7805"></a>royal seats of two kingdoms, the Hebrew word AI or Greek word Αἰα being <a id="l7806"></a>prefixed to signify the land of those cities, &amp; the name Æthiopia being after<a id="l7807"></a>ward extended to all the country upon the Nile above  Coptus &amp; that of <a id="l7808"></a>Egypt to all the country upon the Nile below Syene. For Herodotus tells us that Egypt was anciently the name of Thebais. And so [the land of <a id="l7809"></a>Pathros might at first signify only the land under the dominion of the <a id="l7810"></a>city Pathros, &amp;] Mizraim might at first signify only the land on both <a id="l7811"></a>sides the Nile under the dominion of the city Mesir &amp; afterwards be <a id="l7812"></a>extended to all the lower Egypt peopled from  thence upon the invention <a id="l7813"></a>of corn.  And the land of Pathros might originally signify the <a id="l7814"></a>land under the dominion of the city Pathros As Homer places Thebes in Ethiopia so Herodotus tells us that Ægypt was anciently the name of Thebais that is of the upper Egypt including Coptus &amp; to this day the Egyptians  call themselves Coptites <a id="l7815"></a>whence its probable – that  Æthiopia &amp; Egypt were originally the names of two kingdoms under the dominion of <a id="l7816"></a>Coptus &amp; Thebes, the hebrew word Ai or Greek word Αἰα which signifies a land, being <a id="l7817"></a>prefixed to denote the Land of  Thebes &amp; the land of  Coptus &amp; that the names were <a id="l7818"></a>afterwards extended by conquest,  Æthiopia to all the people upon the Nile  above <a id="l7819"></a>Thebes  &amp; Egypt to all the people upon the Nile below  Syene.   And so <a id="l7820"></a>Mizraim might at first signify only the people  on both sides the Nile subject to <a id="l7821"></a>the city Mesir next above the Delta, &amp; afterwards be extended to all the lower Egypt peopled from <a id="l7822"></a> thence by the invention of corn.</p>

<p id="par1083">Pliny <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n138-ref">[138]</sup> tells us <em class="underline">Nave primus in Græciam ex Ægypto Danaus <a id="l8170"></a>advenit: inter ratibus navigabatur inventis in mare rubro inter <a id="l8171"></a>insulas a rege Erythra</em>. Navigation therefore began first in the Red Sea <a id="l8172"></a>&amp; was thence propagated into the mediterranean. ffor the Red sea  being <a id="l8173"></a>very  shallow &amp;  for that reason calmer then the Mediterranean,  it was easier to sail there <a id="l8174"></a>from Island to Island in such small vessels as were at first found out. The invention of  such <a id="l8175"></a>vessels on that sea is attributed to king Erythra, that is to the king of Edom <a id="l8176"></a>ffor Esau Edom &amp; Erythra are words of  the same signification &amp; signify <em class="underline">red</em> <a id="l8177"></a>whence that sea was called mare Erythræum, the red sea or Sea of Edom. <a id="l8178"></a> From these Edomites the Phœnicians seem to have had their rise for <a id="l8179"></a>the Phœnicians traded first upon the red sea &amp; went from thence to the <a id="l8180"></a>mediterranean as they themselves &amp; the Persians related to Herodotus <a id="l8181"></a>&amp; so Pliny (l. 4 <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) <em class="underline">Tyrij orti ab Erythræo mari ferebantur</em> &amp; Solinus <a id="l8182"></a><em class="underline">Tyrij a mari rubro profeti</em>. Hence Dionysius Afer calls the inhabitants of <a id="l8183"></a>Phœnicia Erythræans &amp; his old Interpreter thinks the name taken from the <a id="l8184"></a>red sea.  And Strabo tells us that <em class="underline">some report that the Phœnicians &amp; <a id="l8186"></a>Sidonians were colonies of the inhabitants of the Ocean &amp; that they were <a id="l8187"></a>called Phœnicians [Punici] because the sea is red</em>. According to which opinion  Phœnician (Punicus, red) is a word of the same signification with Erythræan or Edomite <a id="l8188"></a>How &amp; when the Phœnicians came from the red sea may be gathered from <a id="l8189"></a>the History of David. ffor when David smote Edom, Ioab stayed there with all <a id="l8190"></a>Israel six months untill he had smitten every male in Edom 1 King. 11.15, 16. <a id="l8191"></a>This made  Hadad the young king of Edom fly  into Egypt with certain Edomites his fathers servants, <a id="l8192"></a>&amp; as many of the Edomites as could escape fled to the Philistims &amp; to Sidon <a id="l8193"></a> &amp; other places where they could be protected. So Stephanus in Azot tells us τατην – – – – – – – – Israelites – – – – – – –  By this  victory  over the Edomites Ezion Geber &amp; Eloth  sea-ports <a id="l8196"></a>of the Edomites on the Red Sea) came into the hands of David, &amp; his son Solo<a id="l8197"></a>mon built a Navy – – – – a Navy on the Red Sea. Thus the trade <a id="l8198"></a>of the Edomites on the Red Sea came into the hands of Solomon &amp; Hyram. <a id="l8199"></a> And David having put garrisons in all Edom whereby the Edomites were kept from returning home &amp; therefore they begun a new trade upon the Mediterranean in such <a id="l8200"></a>vessels as they had used before on the Red sea. In these vessels they sailed <a id="l8201"></a>by the shoar till they came as far as Grece, &amp; this sort of navigation <a id="l8202"></a>continued in use till the Egyptians invented long ships in one of which with <a id="l8203"></a>50 oars Danaus came into Greece. In imitation of this ship the Greeks built <a id="l8204"></a>the ship Argo Then Dædalus invented Sails &amp; Masts &amp; navigation still improving the Phenicians soon after the <a id="l8205"></a>Trojan war (as Strabo relates<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>)<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> sailed to the middle of the coast of Afric where they built cities &amp; <a id="l8206"></a>went out beyond the Pillars of Hercules into the Atlantic  Sea. These Phenicians <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p145v"> &lt;145r&gt; </span> 
seem to be chiefly  Zidonians the Edomites flying to the ene Israel ffor in those days the Zidonians grew famous <a id="l8207"></a>among the Greeks while Tyre was scarce known to them.  Homer <a id="l8208"></a>often names Zidon <a id="l8209"></a>&amp; Zidonians but makes no mention of Tyre</p>
<p id="par1084">Now this new  trafick upon the mediterranean soon gave <a id="l8210"></a>occasion to new discords by the rapture of weomen. For Herodotus <a id="l8211"></a>tells us – – – driven from the Red sea by the wars of David.</p>
<p id="par1085">The expulsion of the shepherds out of Egypt Polemo places <a id="l8212"></a>in the time of Apis the son of Phoroneus as above, but this Apis was <a id="l8213"></a>a little later being supposed by the Greeks to be the Egyptian Osiris who <a id="l8214"></a>was Sesostris as we shall shew hereafter. Iustin Martyr (in Cohortatione ad <a id="l8215"></a>Græcos) tells us that Apion the son of Possidonius in his Commentary against <a id="l8216"></a>the Iews &amp; in his 4<sup>th</sup> book of Histories saith that when Inachus  <a id="l8217"></a>reigned at Argos the Iews under the conduct of Moses departed from <a id="l8218"></a>Amasis King of Egypt: &amp; that the same thing is reported by Ptolomy the <a id="l8219"></a>Mendesian an Egyptian Priest who wrote the affairs of Egypt &amp; by Hella<a id="l8220"></a>nicus &amp; Philocorus who wrote the Acts of the Athenians, &amp; by Castor &amp; <a id="l8221"></a>Thallus &amp; Alexander Polyhistor. The shepherds were therefore expelled <a id="l8222"></a>Egypt &amp; the Monarchy of Egypt was erected in the days of Inachus the <a id="l8223"></a>father of Phoroneus &amp; Io &amp; this is confirmed by the rapture of Io which <a id="l8224"></a>Herodotus places – – – David over Edom. Its confirmed also by the <a id="l8225"></a>Acts of Phoroneus who is reported the first who made laws &amp; erected Courts <a id="l8226"></a>of Iustice at Argos &amp; reduced the people from a rude &amp; salvage way of life to <a id="l8227"></a>a civil one &amp; erected an Altar to Iuno. ffor these things the Greeks <a id="l8228"></a>learnt of the Egyptians &amp; Phenicians &amp; therefore Phoroneus reigned after the Phenicians <a id="l8229"></a>began to saile  into Greece &amp; by consequence after the expulsion of <a id="l8230"></a>the shepherds &amp; Edomites.</p>
<p id="par1086">Cecrops is recconed the first Egyptian who led a colony into Greece <a id="l8231"></a>He <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n139-ref">[139]</sup> first called Iupiter God &amp; set up an Altar at Athens &amp; erected a <a id="l8232"></a>Statue to Minerva &amp; after him came in the whole genealogy of the <a id="l8233"></a>Gods of Greece.

<p id="par1087">What we have hitherto said concerning the expulsion of the shepherds <a id="l8248"></a>&amp; their coming into Phœnicia &amp; Greece is confirmed by Diodorus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n141-ref">[141]</sup> who in <a id="l8249"></a>his 40<sup>th</sup> Book  saith that in Egypt there  were formerly multitudes of stran<a id="l8250"></a>gers of several nations who used forreign rites &amp; ceremonies in worshipping <a id="l8251"></a>the Gods for which  they were expelled Egypt – – – before the days of <a id="l8252"></a>Seostris</p>

<p id="par1093">Solon having travelled into Egypt &amp; conversed with the Priests of <a id="l8266"></a>Sais about their antiquities, wrote a Poem of what he had learnt <a id="l8267"></a>but did not finish it, &amp; this Poem fell into the hands of Plato, who <a id="l8268"></a>relates out of it that   at the straits mouth  near <a id="l8269"></a>hercules pillars,  there was an Island called Atlantis the people <a id="l8271"></a>of which 9000 years before the days of Solon reigned over  Libya as far as Egypt &amp; over Europe as <a id="l8272"></a>far as the Tyrrhene sea &amp; all this force collected into one body <a id="l8273"></a>  invaded Egypt<sup>2</sup> &amp; Greece<sup>1</sup> &amp; what ever was conteined within the <a id="l8274"></a>pillars of Hercules but was resisted &amp;  checked by the Athenians &amp; other <a id="l8275"></a>Greeks, &amp; thereby the rest of the nations not yet conquered were <a id="l8276"></a>preserved. He saith also that in those days the Gods by consent <a id="l8277"></a>divided the whole earth amongst themselves partly into larger <a id="l8278"></a>partly into smaller portions, &amp; instituted Temples &amp; sacred rites <a id="l8279"></a>to themselves &amp; that the Island Atlantis fell to the lot of <a id="l8280"></a>Neptune who made his Eldest Son Atlas king of the whole island  <a id="l8281"></a> a part of which  was called Gadir, &amp; that in the <a id="l8282"></a>history of the said wars mention was made of Cecrops Erechtheus <a id="l8283"></a>Erechthonius, Erisichthon &amp; others before Theseus, &amp; also of the <a id="l8284"></a>weomen who  warred with the men, &amp; of the habit &amp; statue of <a id="l8285"></a>Minerva,  the study of war in those days being common to <a id="l8286"></a>men &amp; weomen. By all which  circumstances it is manifest that the wars which <a id="l8287"></a>Sesostris  made upon the nations by land &amp; sea <a id="l8288"></a>&amp; the invasion of Egypt by Antæus are here described &amp; how after the death of  Sesostris his captains <a id="l8289"></a> shared his conquests  among them (as Alexanders captains did his  conquests long after) &amp; instituting Temples &amp; Priests <a id="l8290"></a>&amp; sacred rites to themselves caused themselves to be worshipped as Gods, &amp; <a id="l8291"></a> that the Island Gadir or Gades fell <a id="l8293"></a>to the lot of Neptune. For there  Vlysses being shipwrackt  was received by Calypso the <a id="l8294"></a>daughter of Atlas  as Homer relates. He calls it the Ogygian island,  &amp; places it 20  <a id="l8297"></a>days sail westward from the Island Pheacia, or Corcyra, And so far it  is now from Corcyra to <a id="l8298"></a>Gades, recconing with the ancients about 1000 stadia to a days saile.</p>
<p id="par1094"> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p148r"> &lt;148r&gt; </span> </p>
<p id="par1095" class="i0">And it is further observable that this island is by Homer described a small one  destitute of shipping <a id="l8310"></a>&amp; cities &amp; inhabited only by Calypso &amp; her weomen who dwelt in <a id="l8311"></a>a cave in the middle of a wood, there being no men in the <a id="l8312"></a>island to assist Vlysses in building a ship or to accompany him <a id="l8313"></a>from thence to Corcyra which description agrees well to the Island Gades.  And the time when the Gods made <a id="l8314"></a>war &amp; shared the earth &amp; caused themselves to be worshipped <a id="l8315"></a>as Gods is  by Solon limited to the age of Neptune the grand<a id="l8316"></a>father of Calypso &amp; so was but two generations before the <a id="l8317"></a>destruction of Troy or about 400 years before Solon went into Egypt. But the  Priests of Egypt  in those 400 <a id="l8319"></a>years  had magnified the stories &amp; antiquity of their Gods so exceed<a id="l8320"></a>ingly, as to make them  nine thousand years older then Solon, &amp; <a id="l8321"></a>to represent the Island Atlantis bigger then all Afric &amp; Asia <a id="l8322"></a>together &amp;  full of people. And because in the days <a id="l8323"></a>of Solon  this great  island did not appear they pretended that it <a id="l8324"></a>was sunk into the Sea with all its people.

<p id="par1100">So then the nations at first used  <a id="l8369"></a>Lunar months &amp; <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">solar</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">Lunisolar</span></span> years, but these months &amp; years being of no certain <a id="l8370"></a>length, were unfit for computation, &amp; therefore when the nations  <a id="l8371"></a>were to  reccon times past or to come   without seeing the Sun Moon, they took the next round numbers of 30 days to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p149v"> &lt;149v&gt; </span> a month &amp; 12 months to a year, &amp; so formed a year of 360 days &amp;  used this year as convenient for computations &amp; equipollent to <a id="l8373"></a>the Lunisolar year &amp; exact enough for such  purposes as they <a id="l8374"></a>applied it unto. This was their Kalendar And according to this way of recconing they  divided the Zodiac into 12 signes &amp; every Signe into <a id="l8376"></a>30 parts or degrees, so that a degree might answer to  the Sun's motion <a id="l8377"></a>in a day. And this seems to have been the original of dividing a <a id="l8378"></a>circle into 360  degrees, the  first Astronomers recconing that in <a id="l8379"></a>360 days the Sun ran round the whole Zodiac. ffor  before the use <a id="l8380"></a>of letters &amp; invention of Astronomy, it is not to be supposed that <a id="l8381"></a>men knew the just length of the solar year. This year of 360 days <a id="l8382"></a>they used without correction in recconing time past or to come where they <a id="l8383"></a>could have no assistance from the courses of the Sun &amp; Moon to correct it <a id="l8384"></a>but in recconing time present they always corected it by the courses <a id="l8385"></a>of the sun &amp; moon omitting a day or two in the month as often as <a id="l8386"></a>they found  30 days too long for the course  <a id="l8387"></a>of the Moon &amp; adding a  month to the year as <a id="l8388"></a>often as they  found twelve  months too short for the <a id="l8389"></a> course of the Sun &amp; return of the seasons. ffor Cicero tells us<sup class="note" id="n149-ref">[149]</sup> that the Sicilians &amp; <a id="l8390"></a>other Greeks to make their days &amp; months agree with the courses of <a id="l8391"></a>the sun &amp; moon sometimes took away a day or two from the month <a id="l8392"></a>&amp; sometimes made the month longer by one or two days. And Herodo<a id="l8393"></a>tus in speaking of the year of 12 months or 360 days tells us that the Greeks  added a <a id="l8394"></a>thirteenth month every other year  to make the seasons agree.</p>
<p id="par1101"> <a id="l8395"></a>And this  sort of yeare seems to have been gene<a id="l8396"></a>rally received by  the  ancient nations who used the Lunisolar year. ffor the Egyptians  <a id="l8397"></a>added five days to the end of it &amp; Moses in describing the flood puts five <a id="l8398"></a>months equal to 150 days, &amp; Daniel puts a time or artificiall year for 360 <a id="l8399"></a>days, every day being  taken for a   natural or Lunisolar year; </p>

<p id="par1103">   As the nations used this year of 360 days  in recconing time <a id="l8401"></a>past or to come as a convenient approach of the Lunisolar year &amp; in applying it to the time current corrected it perpetually by <a id="l8402"></a>the courses of the Sun &amp; Moon , so they  found out afterwards  other rules for determining the <a id="l8403"></a>Lunisolar year more exactly.  And the 1<sup>st</sup> <a id="l8404"></a>rule seems to have been of intercaling three months in eight years. ffor the old Greeks (Solinus c 3. Macrob l 1 c 13.<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>)<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> added a <a id="l8405"></a>13<sup>th</sup> month every other year  excepting once in eight years, forming their years of 12 &amp; 13 months alternately to make it agree with the seasons as Censorinus &amp; Herodotus inform us (Censorinus c. 18. Herod l. 1. 2) . And hence arose the  Octaeteris <a id="l8408"></a>of the Ancients consisting of 99 Lunar months &amp; the Tetraeteris <a id="l8409"></a>consisting alternately of 49 &amp; 50 Lunar months &amp; the Dieteris consisting <a id="l8410"></a>three times of 25 Lunar months &amp; once of 24. </p>
<p id="par1104"> The next rule seems to have been of recconing the Lunar months to <a id="l8415"></a>consist of 29 &amp; 30 days alternately.  For the Greeks at first recconed 30 days <a id="l8416"></a>to a Calender month  as above &amp; afterwards 30 &amp; 29 alternately, as Geminus c. 6 informs <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p150r"> &lt;150r&gt; </span> us, &amp; the custome of recconing 30 &amp; 29 alternately seemes to have been introduced <a id="l8417"></a>among the Athenians by Solon who for that end called the 30<sup>th</sup> day ενην  καὶ νεαν <a id="l8418"></a>the old &amp; the new. </p>
<p id="par1105">Afterwards the Greeks  to bring the years more nearely to an <a id="l8419"></a>equality added the intercalary month not every other year but in the 3<sup>d</sup> 5<sup>th</sup> &amp; <a id="l8420"></a>8<sup>th</sup> year of the Octaeteris as Geminus tells  us.

<p id="par1106">Thus the nations in reducing the Lunisolar year to rules formed various Calendars, first <a id="l8431"></a>that of 12 months to a year &amp; 30 days to a month, then the  <a id="l8432"></a>Dieteris, Tetraeteris, Octaeteris,  Hexcædecaeteris, Enneadecaeteris &amp;c  For as <a id="l8433"></a>often as they found their Calendars disagree from the  courses of the Sun &amp; Moon <a id="l8434"></a>they   corrected them by  adding or omitting a day or two in the month or a month in the year &amp; sought out new rules till they had made their Calendars as <a id="l8435"></a>exact as they could.  But the Egyptians neglecting the course of the Moon <a id="l8436"></a>added five days to the end of the 360 to make their year agree only with the course <a id="l8437"></a>of the sun: which correction was afterwards found too short by about six hours, &amp; <a id="l8438"></a>therefore Iulius Cæsar added a day in every four years.   which makes the year too long by a week in <a id="l8440"></a>900  years.</p>

<p id="par1128">The erecting of the Amphictyonic Councils is by some ascribed to <a id="l8585"></a>Acrisius by others to Amphictyon king of Athens. They both flourished at once in <a id="l8586"></a>the reign of David &amp; therefore that Council was erected in  his reign by <a id="l8587"></a>the joynt endeavours of these kings. And the time of erecting this Council <a id="l8588"></a>discovers the occasion of erecting it.  ffor in those days Greece  abounded <a id="l8589"></a>with many foreign nations.  Strabo tells us<sup class="note" id="n150-ref">[150]</sup> that almost all Greece was <a id="l8590"></a>anciently inhabited by barbarous nations   as the <a id="l8591"></a>Phrygians brought thither by Pelops, the Egyptians by Danaus, the Dryopes, Caucones, Pelasgians, Leleges, &amp; others within the Istmus, &amp; without it by <a id="l8592"></a>the Thracians who came with Eumolpus, the people of Tereus in Daulis <a id="l8593"></a>of Phocis, the Phœnicians in Cadmeia, the Aones, Tembices &amp; Hyantes in <a id="l8594"></a>Bœotia. And Thucydides saith that  a region called Acta neare mount Athos <a id="l8595"></a>conteined several cities, as the Andrean colony, &amp; Thyssus &amp; Cleonæ &amp; Acrothous &amp; Olophyxus &amp; Dion which were inhabited by promiscuous <a id="l8596"></a>barbarous nations speaking two languages &amp; by some of Calcidon but <a id="l8597"></a>chiefly by the Tyrrhenian Pelasgians who once inhabited Lemnos &amp; <a id="l8598"></a>Athens &amp; by the Bisaltes &amp; Crestones &amp; Edones living disperst in <a id="l8599"></a>villages. And among these nations were the Odomantes a people <a id="l8600"></a> who used circumcision &amp; loved onyons &amp; therefore came either from Egypt Idumæa or Palestine &amp; perhaps had the name of <a id="l8601"></a>Odomantes from Edom.<sup class="note" id="n151-ref">[151]</sup> The Iones who past into Asia minor were originally Petosirians &amp; so were the Æoles Now while Grece was in this  confusion a common <a id="l8602"></a>council was very necessary for preventing or composing wars &amp; commotions , doing justice  between the several nations,  granting or refusing seats to <a id="l8604"></a>newcomers &amp; consulting the common safety of Greece. And therefore its reasonable to believe that the Amphictionic Council <a id="l8605"></a>was  occasioned by the coming of Cadmus with many new colonies <a id="l8606"></a>&amp; seating them in several parts of Greece &amp; by consequence that it was erected about the middle of Davids reign.

<p id="par1129" class="i0">Celeus  was  the son of Rhearus the son of Cranaus the successor of Cecrops <a id="l8608"></a> was contemporary to Erechtheus &amp; therefore Cecrops was almost three generations <a id="l8609"></a>older then Erechtheus  for Celeus &amp; Erechtheus were contemporary &amp; flourished in the days of Eli.   Between Cranaus &amp; <a id="l8610"></a>Erectheus  Chronologers place Amphictyon Erechthonius &amp; Pandion supposing this Pandion  representing this Pandion to be the  son of Erechthonius &amp; father of Erechtheus. <a id="l8612"></a> whereas Erechthonius &amp; his son <a id="l8614"></a>Pandion are the same men with Erechtheus &amp; his son Pandion.  ffor Erechtheus is called the son of the earth by Homer &amp; therefore his father <a id="l8616"></a>was unknown to the Greeks. He did not inherit his fathers kingdom but was elected by the <a id="l8617"></a>people for his benefaction of corn. He was the first that called Athens by that name &amp; <a id="l8618"></a>therefore instituted the games  which were first called Athenæa &amp; then Panathe<a id="l8619"></a>næ &amp; are ascribed Erechthonius. And if there was an Erechthonius two generations older then <a id="l8620"></a>Erechtheus he would have been contemporary to Cranaus whereas he is represented to succeed Amphictyon the successor of Cranaus. Amphictyon therefore was the prede<a id="l8621"></a>cessor of Erechtheus &amp; reigned at that time when Erechtheus procured a great quanti<a id="l8622"></a>ty of corn from Egypt, &amp; Erechtheus was a forreigner who came into Greece  about the same time with  Cadmus.  By his sacrificing his daughter  he seems to be a Phœnician  but Diodorus <a id="l8625"></a>saith he was an Egyptian, &amp; he might be one of the Phenician Shepherds <a id="l8626"></a>who a little before were driven out of Egypt, &amp; now came with Proteus &amp; <a id="l8627"></a>Cadmus into Greece. For the colonies which came from Phenicia &amp; Egypt &amp; other places into <a id="l8628"></a>Greece were  more numerous then is described in history.  ffor instance <a id="l8629"></a>Thucydides tells us that a region called Acta neare mount Athos  conteined several <a id="l8630"></a>cities, as  The colony of the Andrians, &amp; Thyssus &amp; Cleonæ &amp; Acrothous &amp; Olophyxus &amp; Dion <a id="l8631"></a>which were inhabited by  promiscuous barbarous nations speaking two languages &amp; by some of <a id="l8632"></a>Chalcedon but chiefly by the Tyrrhenian Pelasgians who once inhabited Lemnos &amp; Athens <a id="l8633"></a>&amp; by the Bisaltes &amp; Crestones &amp; Edones living  disperst in villages. (Thucyd. l. 4 <a id="l8634"></a>p. 325.  And among these nations were the Odomantes a people who  used circumcision. We told you above that Cadmus placed a colony in <a id="l8635"></a>Calcis &amp; another in Bisaltia but  when &amp; how the rest of these barbarous nations  came hither I do not find mentioned in history.  Its probable that some of them came with <a id="l8638"></a>Cadmus, &amp; that the Odomantes were Edomites as some think.] And Strabo tells <a id="l8639"></a>us that almost all Greece was anciently  inhabited by barbarus nations as the Phrygians <a id="l8640"></a>brought thither by Pelops, the Egyptians by Danaus, the Dyopes, Caucones, Pelasgians <a id="l8641"></a> Leleges &amp; others within the Isthmus, &amp; without it the Thracians who came with <a id="l8642"></a>Eumolpus, the people of Terens  in Daulis of Phocis, the Phenicians in Cadmæia, the Aones &amp; Tembices  &amp;  Hyantes in Bœotia [whereof the Aones &amp; Tembices or <a id="l8643"></a>Tempices came from Sumium.] Strabo l 7. p 321 [&amp; l. 9, p. 401.]</p>

And Thymætes  a very old writer <a id="l8883"></a>saith that Rhea  stirred up the <a id="l8884"></a>Titans against Bacchus.

Perhaps the army of the Iews <a id="l8895"></a>was the Bætylus which this Saturn could not digest &amp; that being beaten at Maresah <a id="l8896"></a> the people revolted &amp; set up his son.

<p id="par1154">Herodotus tells us from the Priests of Egypt that from Menes to Mœris inclusively, there were 330 kings who reigned 11000 <a id="l8914"></a>years recconing 3 reigns to an hundred years &amp; from Menes to Sethon  inclusively to the beginning of the reign of twelve kings there <a id="l8915"></a>were  341 reigns. And this is all one as to tell us that from the  beginning of the reign of Mœris to <a id="l8916"></a>the beginning of the reign of the twelve kings there were twelve reigns of kings that is  <a id="l8917"></a>two hundred &amp; forty years .   &amp; whether Sethon or <a id="l8919"></a>Tirhaca was the last of the kings of Egypt  who reigned before the twelve kings <a id="l8920"></a> Egypt was conquered by Asserhadon &amp; an end put to the reign of those kings <a id="l8921"></a>in the year of Nabonassar 69. Count backwards 240 years &amp; they will place <a id="l8922"></a>the beginning of the reign of Mœris  seventy and one years after the death of Solomon <a id="l8923"></a>or in the time of the Trojan warr. So then the Egyptians in the days of Herodotus <a id="l8924"></a>had not much raised the antiquities of their kings who reigned at Memphys from the <a id="l8925"></a>days of Mœris.  <a id="l8926"></a> Herodotus tells us that the eleven kings who reigned after Mœris,  were <a id="l8927"></a>Sesostris Peron Proteus Rhampsinitus Cheops Cepren Minerinus Asychis Amysis Sabachus <a id="l8928"></a>&amp; Sethon. But Sesostris Pheron Proteus &amp; Rhampsinitus reigned   at Thebes &amp; are to be omitted &amp; Nitocris <a id="l8929"></a>reigned after him &amp; is to be added. And thus nine kings will reign at Memphis before <a id="l8930"></a>the conquest of Egypt by Asserhadon,  And if Tirhacah be added, he will make a tenth <a id="l8931"></a>And these nine or ten reigns at about 20 years a piece amount to about 180 or 200 years <a id="l8932"></a>which counted back from the year of Nabonassar 69 place the beginning of the <a id="l8933"></a>reign of Mœris about  121 years after the death of Solomon <a id="l8934"></a>And thereabout we have placed it. It could not be earlier because Homer celebrates Thebes as in glory in his days &amp; makes no mention of Memphys. Whence it may be understood that the Chronology <a id="l8935"></a>of the kings of Egypt  who reigned at Memphis,  hath not been much corrupted. The corruption lay in inserting 330 kings <a id="l8937"></a>of Thebes between Menes &amp; Mœris  the last of them. <br><br></p>

And these reigns at the rate of 20 <a id="l8947"></a>years to a reign  amount unto 240 years, which counted back from the <a id="l8948"></a>year of Nabonassar 78 place the beginning of the reign of Mœris  <a id="l8949"></a>71 years after the death of Solomon, or in the time of the Trojan warr. The <a id="l8950"></a>Egyptians therefore in the days of Herodotus had not much  augmented the <a id="l8951"></a>antiquity of their kings who reigned at Memphis.  For <a id="l8952"></a>they reignd at Thebes till Mœris translated the seat of the empire from Thebes to <a id="l8953"></a> Memphis.  Thebes was the seat of the Empire during <a id="l8955"></a>the reign of Sesostris Pheron Proteus &amp; Rhampsinitus &amp; therefore Mœris should <a id="l8956"></a>have been placed after them. And Nitocris reigned at Memphis &amp; therefore should <a id="l8957"></a>have been placed after him. And Sethon  &amp; Tirhakah vanquished the army of the <a id="l8958"></a>Assyrians in the  14<sup>th</sup> year of Hezekiah  that is in the year of Nabonassar 34.

For Ramesses was the son &amp; successor of Mœris: Now Menes built the body of the temple of Vulcan, Ramesses the first portico <a id="l8972"></a>thereof &amp;  Mœris the  second portico. But the Egyptians for making their Gods &amp; <a id="l8973"></a>kingdom look ancient have inserted 330 kings  of Thebes  between the builders of the first &amp; second Portico of this temple  &amp; supposed that these kings reigned  <a id="l8976"></a>eleven thousand years, as if  if any temple could stand so long.

<p id="par1170">Iosephus relates out of the Phœnician records that  in the reign of Ithobalus King of Tyre that city was beseiged by <a id="l9044"></a>Nebuchadnezzar thirteen years together.   In the <a id="l9045"></a>end of that siege Ithobalus their king was slain (Ezek. 28.8, 9, 10) &amp; after him accord<a id="l9046"></a>ing to the Tyrian records reigned Baal  ten years, Ecnibalus &amp; Chelbes one year <a id="l9047"></a>Abbarus three months Mytgonus &amp; Gerestratus six years, Balatorus one year, Merba<a id="l9048"></a>lus four years &amp; Iromus twenty years &amp; in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Iromus say the Tyrian <a id="l9049"></a>records the reign of Cyrus began in Babylonia. Therefore the siege of Tyre  began 48 years before the  reign of Cyrus in Babylonia <a id="l9051"></a> It began  when Ierusalem had been newly taken &amp; burnt <a id="l9053"></a>with the Temple (Ezek 26)  &amp; by consequence after the eleventh year of Iehojakins captivity or 159<sup>th</sup> year year of Nabonassar &amp; therefore the reign of Cyrus in Bab. began after the year of Nabonassar 207. and it ended  before the  eight <a id="l9055"></a>&amp; twentieth year of Iehojakins captivity  or 176<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l9056"></a>Nabonassar (Ezek 29.27) And therefore the reign of Cyrus in Babylonia began   before the year  of Nabonassar 211. By this argument the first year of <a id="l9057"></a>Cyrus was one of the 3 intermediate years 208, 209 &amp; 210. And this  agrees <a id="l9058"></a>well with the Canon which makes it the year of Nabonassar 210.  It <a id="l9059"></a>shews also that as the Iews  dated the reign of Nebuchadnezzar from his invading &amp; conquering Iudea  in  the life time of his father so the Phœnicians <a id="l9061"></a> dated the reign of Cyrus from his invading &amp; conquering Babylonia in the <a id="l9062"></a>life time of Darius. And whilst the author of the Canon uses the same reccon<a id="l9063"></a>ing, its probable that this was the most usual recconing of the oriental nati<a id="l9064"></a>ons, &amp; that according to the same recconing the Iews were released from captivity in the first year of Cyrus <a id="l9065"></a> while Darius was yet  alive, that is  in the  Iewish year which began with the Month Nisan in the year of Nabonassar 210.  <a id="l9067"></a> &amp; was the  seventieth year of Nebuchad<a id="l9068"></a>nezzars reign over Iudea. ffor  if it was the first year after the death of Darius there will be two years between the <a id="l9069"></a>fall of Babylon &amp; the release of the Captivity, &amp; 72 years  between the <a id="l9070"></a>conquest of Iudea in the  third year of Iehojakim &amp; the release of the Captivity in <a id="l9071"></a>the first of Cyrus.</p>
<p id="par1171">And yet I do not find that any nation ever kept an account  in their civil <a id="l9072"></a>affairs by such an artificial year. In all antiquity there is no mention of any æra of such years.  <a id="l9073"></a>Nor is it probable that such an Æra could have been lasting because in the space of 35 years it would turn winter into summer &amp; summer into winter. Moses tells  us that at the Creation God appointed the Sun &amp; Moon for signes &amp; for seasons <a id="l9074"></a>&amp; for days &amp; for years,  And therefore the first ages measured times &amp; seasons by the visible revolutions of the sun &amp; moon, that is by lunar months &amp; solar years. No other years were fit for determining the  returns of summer &amp; winter seed time &amp; harvest which are the seasons here spoken of. Ioseph interprets  seven  fat kine &amp; seven ears of corn to signify <a id="l9076"></a>seven Egyptian years, a fat  or lean ox being  put for a plentifull or barren year of grass <a id="l9077"></a>&amp;  a good or bad ear of corn for a good or bad harvest , as in the Poet <em class="underline">post septem aristas</em>. And this shews <a id="l9078"></a>that the years of the Egyptians then in use were  numbred according to the returns of summer &amp; harvest <a id="l9079"></a>Such was the year which the Iews brought out of Egypt. It was lunisolar &amp; <a id="l9080"></a>began always in autumn till Moses changed the beginning. Whence it came to pass that the Iews had <a id="l9081"></a>a double year, one for civil affairs which began always in autumn  &amp; which they  brought out of Egypt <a id="l9082"></a>the other for sacred use which was the same with the former excepting that it began always in spring according to the appointment of Moses <a id="l9083"></a> In like manner the other oldest  Nations used a  year which consisted of <a id="l9084"></a>Lunar months &amp; began with that  Lunar month which happened at a certain season <a id="l9085"></a>of the year, as the Olympic years &amp;  Macedonic years with the Lunar months which hap<a id="l9086"></a>pened  in  the summer solstice, the Attic, Bœotic, Laconic &amp; Syracusan years <a id="l9087"></a>with the Lunar month which happened in the winter solstice, the ancient year <a id="l9088"></a>of the Chaldeans &amp; Arabians with the Lunar month  which happened in the autumnal <a id="l9089"></a>æquinox. And so in Italy, Alium Ferentini, alium Lavinij, itemque Albani vel Romani <a id="l9090"></a>haubuerunt annum: ita et aliæ gentes.

<p id="par1189">Egypt (called in scripture Misor &amp; Mizraim &amp; the land <a id="l9249"></a>of Ham) is a long &amp; broad valley or meadow on both sides the Nile between mountains <a id="l9250"></a>&amp; Desarts running north &amp; south  from <a id="l9251"></a>Syene to the Mediterranean. It consists of two regions called Mizraim that is the two lands of Misor: viz<sup>t</sup>, the <a id="l9252"></a>upper lying on both sides the single streame of the Nile &amp; the <a id="l9253"></a>  lower lying upon the mouths of the Nile in <a id="l9254"></a>form of a triangle about 3600 furlongs in compass.  This <a id="l9255"></a>lower was called Delta by the Greeks &amp; Rahab in scripture. <a id="l9256"></a>The upper was again divided into two parts, the  southern <a id="l9257"></a>called Thebais &amp; in scripture the land of Pathros, &amp; the <a id="l9258"></a> northern called Heptanomis. The Metropolis of Thebais was Thebes <a id="l9259"></a>called in scripture Ammon No (now Minio)  that is the city of Ammon or Iupiter <a id="l9260"></a> (or as the 70  interpret) Diospolis It stood on both  banks of the Nile at the distance of about 480 stadia  below the lesser cataract &amp; is now corruptly called Minio. Neare it on the western side of the Nile was the city This anciently the metropolis of a kingdome which at length came under the dominion of Thebes. The Metropolis of <a id="l9261"></a> Heptanomis was  Noph Moph or Memphis a city <a id="l9262"></a>on the west side of the Nile  just above the Delta &amp; about 1000 stadia from the mediterranean. <a id="l9264"></a>Not far from Memphys  were the fields where the Egyptians <a id="l9265"></a>buried their dead &amp; built Pyramids to their memory.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p164v"> &lt;164v&gt; </span>

<p id="par1191">About a mile below Memphys or less the Nile  begins to divide it <a id="l9267"></a>self into several streams to water the Delta. The  direct stream which <a id="l9268"></a>runs  through the middle of the Delta  is called the Thermusiac <a id="l9269"></a>River or Sebennic Ostium. The first stream which parts from it  <a id="l9270"></a>runs on the eastern side of the Delta &amp; is called the Bubastic river <a id="l9271"></a> or Pelusian Ostium. The next stream which separates from the <a id="l9272"></a> direct channel runs on the western side of the Delta &amp; is called the <a id="l9273"></a>Canobic Ostium. These are the three biggest streams &amp; between <a id="l9274"></a>them run several others</p>
<p id="par1192">In the way from Syria into Egypt at the entrance of Egypt <a id="l9275"></a>about three miles from the sea &amp; at some distance from the Pelusiac Ostium of the Nile eastward stood Pelusium called also Sin <a id="l9276"></a>Abaris Sethron &amp; Pithon &amp; westward from it upon the  bank of the  same Pelusiac ostium stood  Ramesses. These <a id="l9278"></a>were the two cities which the Israelites built for Pharaoh &amp; <a id="l9279"></a>between them lay the land of Goshen where Israel was in <a id="l9280"></a>bondage &amp; on the other side of this river was the field &amp; city <a id="l9281"></a>of Zoan or Tanis &amp; higher upon the eastern bank of the same stream was  the city Bubastis called in scripture Phibesneth. On the eastern border of Egypt about <a id="l9282"></a>1500 furlongs  above Pelusium stood the city On Aven <a id="l9283"></a>or Heliopolis whose Priest Potiphera married his daughter Ase<a id="l9284"></a>nath to Ioseph. The way between these two cities was <a id="l9285"></a>through a Desart  <a id="l9286"></a>over which there was an open access from the east into Egypt <a id="l9287"></a>untill Sesac fenced Egypt on that side with a  great <a id="l9288"></a>ditch of water carried from Pelusium to Heliopolis.</p>
<p id="par1193">Between Egypt &amp; the Red sea were several sorts of Arabians <a id="l9289"></a>called Trogloditæ &amp; in scripture Sukkijm. And in Thebais between the <a id="l9290"></a>Nile &amp; the red sea not far from Thebes was  Coptus a common city of the Egyptians &amp; Arabians <a id="l9292"></a>&amp; the Metropolis of the Nome Coptites. This people gave the <a id="l9293"></a>name of Coptites to all the Egyptians &amp; thence the Greeks <a id="l9294"></a>formed ἀια Copti, Ægyptus. Probably the Coptites founded <a id="l9295"></a>Thebes &amp; thereby spread their name with their dominion. <a id="l9296"></a> Yet Egypt is often taken by writers  only for Delta &amp; Heptanomis <a id="l9297"></a>&amp; sometimes only for Delta.</p>

<p id="par1195">Manetho  an Egyptian Priest has given us the names of <a id="l9298"></a>many kings reigning in several parts of Egypt as at Elepantine <a id="l9299"></a>at Diospolis or Thebes, at This, at Memphys, at Heracleapolis at Bubastis at Sais at Xois at Tanis &amp; Eratosthenes has also given us a list <a id="l9300"></a>of the kings of Thebes. Whence  it may be concluded that there have been <a id="l9301"></a> many kingdoms in Egypt at once. But  a certain account <a id="l9302"></a>of their rise magnitude duration &amp; fall is now  not to be had. Yet <a id="l9303"></a>this is certain that before the reign of  Sesac they were all <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p165r"> &lt;165r&gt; </span> <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>swallowed<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> up by the kingdome of Thebes.  In the days of Iacob &amp; Moses there <a id="l9304"></a>was a kingdom in the lower Egypt of a considerable bigness whose <a id="l9305"></a>kings  resided at Ramesses.  For in the City where Pharaoh &amp; his daughter &amp; servants resided there <a id="l9308"></a>the Iews were in bondage  Exod 2.5, 7, 8 &amp; there  Moses did his miracles <a id="l9309"></a>Gen 7.15, 20 &amp; 8.3 &amp; 9.33. And when the first born were smitten which was <a id="l9310"></a>at Midnight Pharaoh rose up in the night &amp; called for Moses &amp; Aaron <a id="l9311"></a>&amp;  ordered them &amp; the people of Israel to get them out of the land &amp; the same <a id="l9312"></a>night the  Egyptians lent the <a id="l9313"></a>Israelites Iewels &amp; rayment &amp; urged them to be gone &amp; the next morning <a id="l9314"></a>Moses &amp; Aaron led the Children of Israel from Ramesses out of Egypt &amp; they journeyed that day with their flocks &amp; herds to Succoth a <a id="l9315"></a>town in the wilderness between Egypt &amp; the red Sea. Gen 11.8 &amp; 12.29, 30, 31,  37, 38 41. Num 33.3 <a id="l9316"></a>Ramesses was therefore the royal seat of this Kingdom, &amp;  under its dominion were the cities  On, Pithon &amp; Zoan with their Nomes  or countries,  so that this kingdom lay on both sides the Bubastic river.  By the  writings of Moses it seems to <a id="l9319"></a>have comprehended but a part of the Delta &amp; to have been as old as the days of <a id="l9320"></a>Abraham.  The kings of Ramesses are not mentioned by Manetho except <a id="l9321"></a>Timaus the last king whom the Shepherds conquered. Nor did  Manetho know any thing <a id="l9322"></a>of the peregrination &amp; servitude of Israel in Egypt but takes the Shepherd Kingdom for the Israelites, which makes me sus<a id="l9323"></a>pect that the kings in his Dynasties are  almost all of them later then the days of Moses. <a id="l9324"></a>ffor he being a Priest of Heliopolis which was under the dominion of Ramessis <a id="l9325"></a>it may be presumed that he would be most diligent &amp; particular in the <a id="l9326"></a>story of his own country.  </p>

<p id="par1200">According to the same Dynasties of Manetho the 15 kings of This  who preceded Sesach reigned 487 years. The  17 of <a id="l9353"></a>Memphys  who preceded him reigned   498 years.

So that in all these <a id="l9356"></a>Dynasties of Manetho there is not one king who reigned above  498 <a id="l9357"></a>years before Sesac, &amp; therefore they are all later then the servitude <a id="l9358"></a>of Israel in Egypt. And yet by adding all the years of these &amp; other <a id="l9359"></a>Dynasties together the Egyptians made their kingdome much older then  Adam. Which shews that the Egyptian  Priests knew not when their own kings reigned.</p>
<p id="par1201">Eratosthenes has given us another Dynasty of 38 kings of Thebes <a id="l9361"></a>the first  of which was Menes &amp; first 19 of which reigned 574 years &amp; the <a id="l9362"></a>20<sup>th</sup> 21<sup>th</sup> &amp; 22<sup>th</sup> called Apappus Echeseos &amp; Nitocris  seem to be the same with the 3 last kings of Memphys Phiops  Methesuphis &amp; Nitocris in the <a id="l9363"></a>sixt Dynasty .  ffor Apappus &amp; Phiops reigned <a id="l9366"></a>each one hundred years &amp; therefore are but two names of one king, Echeseos &amp; Methesuphis reigned each one year <a id="l9367"></a>&amp; Nitocris was a Queen of the same name in both canons. Now before these <a id="l9368"></a>3 kings in the sixt Dynasty reigned  20 other kings of Memphys whose <a id="l9369"></a>reign took up   586 years  according to the 3 4 &amp; 6 Dynasties of Manetho, &amp; therefore Menes the first king of Thebes in the <a id="l9370"></a>Dynasty of Eratosthenes   was not so old by 12 years as the first king of Memphys <a id="l9371"></a>in the Dynasties of Manetho. ffrom all which it seems to me that in all these <a id="l9372"></a>Dynasties of Manetho &amp; Eratosthenes there is nothing so ancient as the <a id="l9373"></a>coming of Israel out of Egypt.</p>
<p id="par1202">Africanus  dates the reign of  Menes the 1<sup>st</sup> king of  Thebes from the 10<sup>th</sup> <a id="l9374"></a>year of the reign of the shepherds mentioned  in the 15 16 &amp; 17 &amp; their reign began after the days <a id="l9375"></a>of Moses as I shall shew hereafter.</p>

<p id="par1214">For better understanding the ancient state of the nations &amp; how <a id="l9397"></a>the four Monarchies arose,  the Chronology <a id="l9398"></a>of those times is to be rectified.

<p id="par1215">And since the Octaeteris was in use in the days of Cadmus &amp; Minos as above, <a id="l9402"></a> we may reccon that this cycle also came in with the Phœnicians.</p>
<p id="par1216"> Stephanus tells us that the City Itanus in Crete was built by Itanus a Ph</p>
<p id="par1217">The Philistims were anciently called  Crethim or Cretans &amp; Gaza one of their five <a id="l9403"></a>head cities was anciently called Minoa whence came the names of Crete &amp; Minos &amp; Minoas the God of Gaza was the same God with <a id="l9404"></a>Iupiter Cretensis,  &amp; the city Itanus in Crete was built by Itanus a Phenician all which argues that the Island Crete was peopled principally from the <a id="l9405"></a>sea coasts of Palestine.</p>
<p id="par1218">The Iupiter of Crete whose worship the Idæi Dactyli introduced was a Phenician God For he was worshipped at <a id="l9406"></a>  Gaza in Palestine by the name of Marnas  which signifies the Lord of <a id="l9407"></a>Men.  In his worship the  Curetes danced about him in armour with drums &amp; <a id="l9408"></a>noisy &amp; warlike musick  to guard him from his father Saturn who fearing the loss of his kingdom would have devoured him <a id="l9409"></a>but in his  stead was presented with a stone  in a cloth resembling him <a id="l9410"></a>&amp; when he found himself deceived was melancholy &amp; sought in all places for <a id="l9411"></a>Iupiter    but Iupiter lay hid in caves &amp; secret places &amp; at length inherited the kingdom The  ceremony sems formed by some of the Philistims in memory <a id="l9413"></a>of Davids living among them when he fled from Saul. ffor Saul &amp; David were the two <a id="l9414"></a>first kings of Israel &amp; in that respect might be  considered as their Saturn <a id="l9415"></a>&amp; Iupiter; And when David was newly become the son in law of Saul  &amp; Saul sought Davids <a id="l9416"></a>life fearing least he should deprive him of the kingdom, &amp; sent for David in bed to slay him <a id="l9417"></a>his wife Michal cloathed an Image with a cloth or shirt &amp; laid it in the bed in the  <a id="l9418"></a>place of David &amp; let David escape &amp; then Saul searched in all places for David &amp; David <a id="l9419"></a>hid himself in caves &amp; secret places &amp; among the Philistims with an armed multitude about him  &amp; at length  succeeded in the kingdom expelling the house of Saul, &amp; became the greatest <a id="l9420"></a>king of that age as Iupiter was the greatest God. The stone which Saturn devoured was a <a id="l9421"></a>Bætylus or Beth-el  for so the Syrians called  the stones which they  supposed inhabited by their Gods. These Bætyls <a id="l9422"></a>were at first rude stones like  Iacob's pillow, then they  formed them square <a id="l9423"></a>or round &amp; at length (as art increased) carued them in the shape of men  Damascius  saw many round Bætyls lying on the top of mount <a id="l9425"></a>Libanus.  By the name  of the stones &amp; the place where they were worshipped &amp; the God of Gaza you <a id="l9426"></a>may know that the story came from Phœnicia.

You have heard also out of Diodorus  <a id="l9617"></a>that the family of   Cadmus came out of Egypt with the shepherds  Apollodorus l. 2 tells us that Cadmus (the father of Cadmus) came out of Egypt into Phœnicia &amp; there planted the seat of his kingdom, &amp; Eusebius &amp; others derive the family of Cadmus from the Egyptian Thebes &amp; there are several arguments that confirm it. ffor Cadmus being <a id="l9619"></a>sent in quest of his sister  &amp; coming – – – – Busiris had fled out of Egypt, <a id="l9620"></a>Proteus seems here to be not the proper name of a man but a title of honour <a id="l9621"></a>signifying Primus or Princeps, a Prince, &amp; he seemes to have been one of the Princes <a id="l9622"></a> of the Shepherds who fled from the King of <a id="l9623"></a>Egypt here called Busiris.

By the name of their  <a id="l9628"></a>city  Erethria, they seem to  be some <a id="l9629"></a>of those Phenicians who came from the Red Sea.</p>
<p id="par1243">Before letters began to be in use there  could be no standing laws in writing &amp;  therefore the  coming of Cadmus into Europe was ancienter <a id="l9631"></a>then the Amphictyonic Counsels &amp; even then  the reign of Phoroneus who <a id="l9632"></a>made laws &amp; erected judicatures.</p>

The Philistimes <a id="l9689"></a>in those days reigned long over Israel so as  to give the name of Palestina to the <a id="l9690"></a>whole land of Canaan.  ffrom the days of Sampson to the 20<sup>th</sup> year of Samuel <a id="l9691"></a>they reigned 40 years over Israel.

<p id="par1312" class="i0">③ From his digging channels from the Nile to the capital cities of Egypt to make <a id="l10271"></a>it usefull that river was consecrated to him &amp; he was called by its names Ægyptus, <a id="l10272"></a>Siris &amp; Nilus.

<p id="par1316">All nations at first  recconed months by the course of the <a id="l10333"></a>Moon &amp; years by the returns of winter &amp; summer spring &amp; autumn. <a id="l10334"></a>And in making Kalendars for their festivals they recconed 30 days <a id="l10335"></a>to a Lunar month &amp; twelve months to a year. So in the time of  <a id="l10336"></a>Noahs flood when the Moon could not be seen, Moses recconed 30 days <a id="l10337"></a>to a month. But if the Moon appeared upon the 30<sup>th</sup> day that day <a id="l10338"></a>was recconned both for the last day of the preceding month &amp; the <a id="l10339"></a>first day of the following.  Thales called the last day of the month the thirtieth Solon called it <a id="l10340"></a> ἔνην καὶ νέαν the old &amp; the new. And if twelve months were <a id="l10341"></a>found too short for the  return of the seasons of the year <a id="l10342"></a>they added a thirteenth. This the Greeks did in the days of Herodo<a id="l10343"></a>tus every other year except once in eight years: which made the Olcta<a id="l10344"></a>eteris or Annus magnus of the ancients. When the Egyptians applied <a id="l10345"></a>themselves to Astronomy they observed the course of the sun by <a id="l10346"></a>the heliacal risings &amp; settings of the stars, &amp; in the sepulcher of <a id="l10347"></a>Osiris counted the days of the Calendar by filling 360 bowles <a id="l10348"></a>with milk, one bowle every day. And finding this recconing too <a id="l10349"></a>short by  about five days, they made their year to consist <a id="l10350"></a>of twelve equal months &amp; five days &amp; in memory thereof  <a id="l10351"></a>placed in the sepulcher of Memnon a circle of 365 cubits in <a id="l10352"></a>compass plated over with gold &amp; divided into 365 equal parts to <a id="l10353"></a>represent all the days in the year &amp; noted upon each part the <a id="l10354"></a>heliacal risings &amp; settings of the stars on that day. And this Astronomical year <a id="l10355"></a>the Priests  of Egypt carried to Babylon. ffor the years of Nabo<a id="l10356"></a>nassar &amp; the year of Egypt began on one &amp; the same day. And <a id="l10357"></a>for determining the cardinal periods of the year the Astrono<a id="l10358"></a>mers of those days observed the Solstices. Aristæus the Astro<a id="l10359"></a>nomer  was born &amp; educated in Libya &amp; was  there <a id="l10360"></a>tutor to Bacchus &amp; brought from thence into Greece the skill <a id="l10361"></a>of observing &amp; determining the solstices by the risings &amp; settings <a id="l10362"></a>of the stars, &amp; married Autonoe the daughter of Cadmus &amp; <a id="l10363"></a>therefore was two or three generations older then the Argonauts. <a id="l10364"></a>Now the first year of Nabonassar began  with the 26<sup>th</sup> of February 747, <a id="l10365"></a>&amp; thirty &amp; thre days  before the vulgar Æra &amp;  five hours before the Equinox according  to the Suns mean <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p185r"> &lt;185r&gt; </span> motion. For it is not likely that the  æquation of the suns mean motion <a id="l10366"></a> should be known in the infancy of Astronomy. Now recconing that the Egyptian year <a id="l10367"></a>wants 5 hours 49′ of the Equinoctial year, the  beginning of this year <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>will<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l10368"></a>move backwards 33 days &amp; 5 hours in 137 years &amp; by consequence this <a id="l10369"></a>year began upon the  vernal equinox according to the suns mean mo<a id="l10370"></a>tion 137 years before the Æra of Nabonassar began , that is, in the year <a id="l10371"></a>of the Iulian Period 3830, or  ninety eight years after the <a id="l10372"></a>death of Solomon.  And if it began the day <a id="l10374"></a>next after the Vernal Equinox it might begin two or three years <a id="l10375"></a>sooner. And there the death of Amenophis may be placed. ffor he is <a id="l10376"></a>mentioned by Homer &amp; Hesiod as one generation younger then Tithonus the <a id="l10377"></a> brother of Priam.</p>
<p id="par1317">The first month of the Lunisolar year began sometimes a week <a id="l10378"></a>or a fortnight before the Equinox &amp; sometimes as much after it <a id="l10379"></a>And this gave occasion to the first Astronomers  who formed the <a id="l10380"></a>Asterisms, to  place the Equinoxes &amp; solstices in the middle of the <a id="l10381"></a>  Constellations of Aries  Cancer Chelæ &amp; Capricorn.  <a id="l10386"></a>Achilles Tatius tells us that some anciently placed the Solstice in the beginning of <a id="l10387"></a>Cancer, others in the eighth degree of Cancer, others about the twelft degree <a id="l10388"></a>&amp; others about the 15<sup>th</sup> degree. This variety of opinions proceeded from the <a id="l10389"></a>Precession of the Equinox then not known to the Greeks. When the  sphere was first <a id="l10390"></a>formed the equinox was in the 15<sup>th</sup> degree or middle of the Constellation of Cancer <a id="l10391"></a>Then it came into the 12<sup>th</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> &amp; 1<sup>st</sup> degree successively. Eudoxus in describing <a id="l10392"></a>the sphere of the ancients  placed the solstices <a id="l10393"></a>&amp; Equinoxes in the middle of the Constellations of Aries Chelæ Cancer &amp; <a id="l10394"></a>Capricorn as is affirmed by Hypparchus Bithynus, &amp; appears also by the description <a id="l10395"></a>of the Equinoctial &amp; Tropical circles in Aratus who copied after Eudoxus &amp; by the <a id="l10396"></a>position of the Colures of the equinoxes &amp; solstices  which in the sphere of <a id="l10397"></a>Eudoxus described by Hipparchus went through the middle of those constellations.  Now Chiron the <a id="l10398"></a>master of Iason the Argonaut delineated σχήματα ὀλύμπου the Asterisms <a id="l10399"></a>as  the ancient author of Gigantomachia cited by Clemens <a id="l10400"></a>Alexandrinus informs us.  [Strom 1. p 306, 332] And Musæus the master of <a id="l10401"></a>Orpheus  &amp; one of the Argonauts made a sphere &amp; is reputed <a id="l10402"></a>the first among the Greeks who made one [Laertius Proæm. l. 1.] And the <a id="l10403"></a>sphere it self shews that it was designed in the time of the Argonautic <a id="l10404"></a>expedition. ffor that expedition is delineated in the asterisms with several other <a id="l10405"></a>ancienter histories of the Greeks. But nothing later then that expedition is <a id="l10406"></a>delineated there. It seems therefore to have been formed by Chiron &amp; Musæus for the <a id="l10407"></a>use of the Argonauts. For the people of the Island Corcyra attributed the <a id="l10408"></a>invention of the sphere to Nausicae the daughter of Alcinous king of the <a id="l10409"></a>Pheaces in that Island, &amp; its most probable that she had it from the Argo<a id="l10410"></a>nauts who in their return home sailed to that island &amp; made some stay <a id="l10411"></a>there with her father. At that time therefore the solstice was reputed in <a id="l10412"></a>the middle of the constellation of Cancer. Afterwards when Thales  began to revive Astronomy &amp; wrote a book of the Tropicks &amp; Equi<a id="l10414"></a>noxes,  it was found in the 12<sup>th</sup> degree of that signe. And at length  in order to publish the Lunar cycle of 19 years Meton &amp; Euctemon <a id="l10416"></a>observed the solstice in the year of Nabonassar 316, &amp; Columella tells us <a id="l10417"></a>that they placed it in the eighth degree of Cancer, which is seven degrees <a id="l10418"></a>backwarder then at first. Now the Equinox goes backward one degree in <a id="l10419"></a>72 years &amp; seven degrees in 504 years. Subduct those years from the 316th year of Nabonassar &amp; the Argonautick expedition will fall upon the 45<sup>th</sup> <a id="l10420"></a>year after the death of Solomon, &amp; so the expedition of Sesostris which was one generation <a id="l10421"></a>earlier, will fall in with that of Sesak.</p>
<p id="par1318">Its probable that when Chiron &amp; Musæus formed the sphære they did not <a id="l10422"></a>observe the  solstice themselves, but placed it where it had been found a little before <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p185v"> &lt;185v&gt; </span> by Atlas who made the first sphere or by  <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Aristæus &amp; <a id="l10423"></a>by<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the Egyptians or Greeks of their days. For after they had once determined the  <a id="l10424"></a>solstice by the risings &amp; settings of the stars it is not likely that they would alter <a id="l10425"></a>the determination before the Equinox had moved sensibly from its first place. <a id="l10426"></a>Its probable also that in those days they divided the Equator only into 360 equal <a id="l10427"></a>parts taking a part for a days motion of the sun according to the Calendar <a id="l10428"></a>of the Lunisolar year, &amp; had not yet begun to divide a degree into  60 <a id="l10429"></a>minutes. And by consequence, when Meton found the  solstice in the 8<sup>th</sup> <a id="l10430"></a>degree of the signes, we may understand that he found it somewhere in the <a id="l10431"></a>eighth degree without determining precisely in what part of the eighth <a id="l10432"></a>degree, &amp;  that the solstice since the first determination of <a id="l10433"></a>its place by the Greeks had gone back between seven &amp; eight degrees:  &amp; therefore it was first determined between 504 &amp; 576 years before the <a id="l10434"></a>Observation of Meton, that is, not later then the 45<sup>th</sup> year after the death of Solomon nor earlier then the 13<sup>th</sup> year of his reign. And this interval of <a id="l10435"></a>time falls in with the days between Aristæus one of the  tutors of  Bacchus &amp; the <a id="l10436"></a>Argonautic expedition, &amp; so makes Bacchus or Sesostris contemporary to Sesak.</p>

This is the Iupiter so much <a id="l10568"></a>celebrated by the Atlantides for his vertuous qualifications,  &amp; large dominions  the son of Saturn <a id="l10570"></a>&amp; Rhea or Pandora.

He <a id="l10572"></a>made a bridge over the Nile – – – – – before the reign of Sesostris. <a id="l10573"></a>He was the first that instituted written laws – – – – letters &amp; was <a id="l10574"></a>Deified.</p>
<p id="par1329">Sanchoniatho tells us that Taauthus whom the Egyptians call Thoth was <a id="l10575"></a>the first that found out Letters &amp; the art of writing for the help of memory <a id="l10576"></a>&amp; Socrates that one of the ancient Gods to whom the bird Ibis was sacred &amp; whose <a id="l10577"></a>name was Theuth was the first who found out Numbers &amp; computation &amp; Geometry <a id="l10578"></a>&amp; Astronomy &amp; the playing at dice &amp; letters, &amp; distinguished vowels from consonants <a id="l10579"></a>&amp; mutes from liquids &amp; taught the art of Grammar. And Diodorus that Mercury <a id="l10580"></a>found out letters &amp; instituted the worship of the Gods &amp; observed the motion of the <a id="l10581"></a>stars &amp; invented Arithmetick &amp; the art of curious graving &amp; cutting of Statues. All <a id="l10582"></a>this is to be understood of  Thoth or Mercury Trismegist who was the secretary &amp; chief Coun<a id="l10583"></a>cellour to Osiris &amp; Isis.  // Manetho tells us of two Mercuries, the first <a id="l10584"></a>called Thoth, the second the son of Agathodæmon &amp; father of Tat – – – <a id="l10585"></a>Temples of Egypt. By the  inscriptions of Thoth &amp; the Obelisks made by Sesostris &amp; some of his successors <a id="l10586"></a>it appears that the Egyptians  used the Hieroglyphic writing  till the death of Sesostris &amp; a good while after.  Thoth formed the Egyptian letters but it  would be some time before <a id="l10588"></a>this way of writing  could come into use &amp; then the second Mercury translated <a id="l10589"></a> the Hieroglyphicall inscriptions into books &amp; laid up the books in the Temples. <a id="l10590"></a>Pliny tells us : Anticlides literas in Ægypto invenisse quendam nomine <a id="l10591"></a>Menona tradidit quindecim annis – – – –  into use. And when Menes began to set down laws in writing <a id="l10593"></a>then  did the Secretaries of the Kings of Egypt <a id="l10594"></a>begin to use writing &amp; then I conceive  did the  same secretaries  translate <a id="l10595"></a>the hieroglyphical inscriptions into Books.  And therefore as the  <a id="l10596"></a> secretary of Osiris was the 1<sup>st</sup> Mercury, so I take the  secretary of <a id="l10597"></a>Menes to be the second Mercury, that Mercury whom Manetho &amp; Era<a id="l10598"></a>tosthenes call Athothes &amp; make the successor of Menes &amp; of whom Manetho saith <a id="l10599"></a>that he built the royal palace in Memphys &amp; wrote books of Anatomy being a <a id="l10600"></a>Physitian.</p>
<p id="par1330">Menes   being the successor of Orus,   his reign falls in with that <a id="l10601"></a> of Memnon otherwise called Amenophis, [ffor Memnon  <a id="l10602"></a>being by the Greeks reputed the son of Tithonus was contemporary to the sons <a id="l10603"></a>of Priam.

<p id="par1339">As the antiquities of the Assyrians have been magnified, so have those of the Chaldeans. ffor Diodorus tells us <a id="l10668"></a>that  when Alexander was in Asia the Chaldeans recconed 470000 years since they first began to observe<a id="l10669"></a>the motions of the starrs.</p>
<p id="par1340" class="i0">For writing was in use among the Israelites in the days of Moses &amp; perhaps some ages before,  which consideration alone  is sufficient to give <a id="l10670"></a>a reputation to the sacred history  much above  the histories of Manetho, Berosus, Ctesias, Herodo<a id="l10671"></a>tus Megasthenes Diodorus Sanchoniatho or any other of the heathen historians.</p>
<p id="par1341" class="i0">We need not wonder therefore that Egypt made no great figure in the world before the expulsion of the shepherds; that the <a id="l10672"></a>kingdom  of Thebais which by expelling them extended it self over all Egypt , after it had conquered Libya &amp; Ethiopia  lastly <a id="l10673"></a>overcame the  nations from the straits mouth to India then divided  every where into small kingdoms &amp; destitute of <a id="l10674"></a>horses &amp; armour of iron;  &amp; that Pul, after the Assyrians  had been captivated (perhaps by the Egyptians) was the first king  who extended the dominion of Nineveh  over all the  Province of Assyria.

They were in use in Israel in the days of Moses &amp; perhaps some <a id="l10681"></a>ages before: for Moses wrote the words of the law upon tables of stone &amp; in books,   &amp; the Acts of the Iudges &amp; kings of Israel &amp; Iudah have been transmitted down to us <a id="l10683"></a>in writing. The Acts of the kings of Tyre were entred in writing from the days of Abibalus &amp; Hirom but are lost. <a id="l10684"></a>The Acts of the Persians were entred in books from the days of Cyrus but are lost.   What were the <a id="l10688"></a>genuine records of Egypt  Chaldea Media &amp; Persia before the Assyrians invaded them is unknown.

<p id="par1342">And while the world was but thinly peopled, &amp; kingdoms were small &amp; numerous &amp; letters were not yet in use <a id="l10691"></a>an exact account of  particular kingdoms is not to be expected for want of sufficient Records.

<p id="par1527">The city Sidon having its name from the  fishes taken on <a id="l11320"></a>it's coast,  it is to be conceived that the Sidonians had fishing boats  <a id="l11321"></a>long before they began to trade  with other nations  by sea &amp; that in these boats <a id="l11322"></a>they were able to go from town to town upon the sea coast of Phenicia &amp; <a id="l11323"></a>so the Egyptians had vessels made of their paper or flagg to  go upon the <a id="l11324"></a>Nile,  before any colonies came from thence to <a id="l11325"></a>Greece as may be gathered from the ark in which Moses was exposed compared with the paper vessels in which they afterward sailed  on the Mediterranean.  But whether Myles set up a mill – – – enquired.</p>
<p id="par1528"> Cepheus  lived  at Ioppa in Phenicia when <a id="l11326"></a>Perseus carried away his daughter, but was an Ethiopian that is an  Egyptian <a id="l11327"></a>of Thebais  or of Ethiopia next above Thebais on the Arabic side of the Nile.  They <a id="l11328"></a>tell us that he  was skilled in Astronomy &amp; for that reason translated by Astronomy into the heavens, &amp;  from his residing at Ioppa a seaport &amp; his skill in Astronomy (which was the study of Navigators<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>)<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> I <a id="l11330"></a>seem to gather that he was a Commander at Sea under the king of Egypt <a id="l11331"></a>&amp; by means of the friendship  between that king &amp; Solomon his son in law was permitted by Solomon to  use the port at Ioppa. Some say that <a id="l11334"></a>he built the city Ioppa &amp; reigned there &amp; perhaps he might build a pallace there <a id="l11335"></a>to reside in with his family.</p>
<p id="par1529">And besides, I do not find that the Greeks had any shipping <a id="l11336"></a>so early. The city Sidon having its name from the fishes taken on <a id="l11337"></a>the sea coast might have fishing boats long before &amp; the Egyptians <a id="l11338"></a>might have vessels of their papyr or flagg  but the <a id="l11339"></a>Greeks had none but such as came from abroad: for they had no  manual <a id="l11340"></a>arts they knew  not how to make ships or to repair those which came from other places. <a id="l11341"></a>They had  no Smiths or Masons or Carpenters to build either ships <a id="l11342"></a>or so much as houses to live in  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p200v"> &lt;200v&gt; </span> houses, no tools of iron or brass to work with, no  Steel  <a id="l11343"></a>iron  copper or brass to make tools of till  the Idæi Dactyli found out  iron in Mount Ida in Crete in the <a id="l11345"></a>days of Minos &amp; Cadmus found out Copper in the Pangæan Mountain <a id="l11346"></a>from which invention the Copperstone has ever since been called Cadmi<a id="l11347"></a>a. And this makes me of opinion that when Myles brought corn out <a id="l11348"></a>of Egypt he brought a Mill also to grind it, there being then no <a id="l11349"></a>artificers in Greece to make such an engin.</p>
<p id="par1530">And since Europa was not carried away by a Hero  but said <a id="l11350"></a>to be stole by Merchants of Crete &amp; yet the Cretans were neither <a id="l11351"></a>merchants nor could build ships  so early,  it inclines me to <a id="l11352"></a>beleive that Europa was not stole but came with a colony of Phenicians to Crete <a id="l11353"></a>about the same <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>time<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> that Cadmus came with other colonies of Phenicians to Greece &amp; <a id="l11354"></a>Asia minor, &amp; that the Idæi Dactyli who found out iron in <a id="l11355"></a>Crete were some of those Phenicians who came with Europa.</p>
<p id="par1531">The Greeks at first lived in caves &amp; dens &amp; were without  towns or houses &amp; without arts &amp; sciences like Salvages.

Pelasgus taught them to cloath themselves with skins  &amp; to eat acorns instead of roots Doxius the son of Cœlus taught them to <a id="l11360"></a>build houses of clay &amp; the brothers Euryalus &amp; Hyperbius taught them <a id="l11361"></a>to build them of brick &amp; thus gave a beginning to towns &amp; societies.  Then <a id="l11362"></a>came in the Phœnicians  in the days of David with many arts . Herodotus tells us that the Phenicians who came with Cadmus taught them letters &amp; the digging &amp; ex<a id="l11363"></a>cocting of Copper,  by which means they furnished <a id="l11365"></a>themselves with utensils &amp; weapons &amp; armour of copper.

<p id="par1532">When the Israelites – – – – by a treaty.</p>
<p id="par1533">Manetho tells us that Thummosis beseiged the shepherds in Abaris untill he despaired of <a id="l11378"></a>forcing them &amp; then covenanted that  upon condition that they would leave Egypt they should <a id="l11379"></a>go safely whether they pleased &amp; thereupon they went out of Egypt through the Desert into <a id="l11380"></a>Syria with all their  possessions &amp; family to the number of 240000. They were <a id="l11381"></a>not driven out of Egypt but retired quietly  with their heards &amp; flocks &amp; wives &amp; children &amp;  upon a compact  <a id="l11382"></a>that they should not be pursued  <a id="l11384"></a>or hurt in their retiring.  And since they did not retire till they had taken care of a safe <a id="l11386"></a>retreat, it may be presumed that they did not retire till they had taken care of a place into which <a id="l11387"></a>they might safely retreat &amp; for that end had treated with the Philistims  the nation <a id="l11388"></a>which lay next Egypt  in the way  towards Syria.</p>
<p id="par1534">The Philistims in those days reigned long over Israel so as to give the name of Palestine <a id="l11389"></a>to the whole land of Canaan. ffrom the days of Sampson to the 20<sup>th</sup> year – – – – &amp; David beat <a id="l11390"></a>them in many battels before they could be subdued. Now the very great numbers – – – – – – <a id="l11391"></a>recovered the liberty of the Hebrews.</p>
<p id="par1535">And all this is the more probable because if the Shepherds  went out of Egypt <a id="l11392"></a>into Palestine  just before Saul revolted from the Philistims, it was easy for Manetho &amp; <a id="l11393"></a>Diodorus to take the revolting Israelites for the shepherds  &amp; so to ascribe <a id="l11394"></a>the building of Ierusalem &amp; the Temple to them as if the wars which Saul &amp; David made upon the <a id="l11395"></a>Philistims had been those by which the shepherds seated themselves in Palestine.  For the heathen historians knew that the Israelites came out of Egypt, but <a id="l11397"></a>how &amp; when they came out they did not know nor that more nations then one came out of <a id="l11398"></a>Egypt &amp; invaded Palestine successively: &amp; therefore they took the two nations of the <a id="l11399"></a>Israelites &amp; Shepherds to be one &amp; the same nation, &amp; some historians hearing that Moses led <a id="l11400"></a>the Israelites out of Egypt took him to be the captain of the Shepherds.</p>
<p id="par1536">In the reign of Saul or immedately before or after when the Philistims  strengthened by the <a id="l11401"></a>access of the Shepherds were in their greatest power they beseiged &amp; took Zidon &amp; thereby gave occasion to the building of Tyre as Trogus in <a id="l11402"></a> his 18<sup>th</sup> book thus mentions: <em class="underline">A rege Ascaloniorum expugnati Sidonij navibus appulsi Tyrem <a id="l11403"></a>urbem ante annum Trojanæ cladis condiderunt.

<p id="par1538">The red sea being very shallow &amp; for that reason calmer then the Mediterranean  was navigable in <a id="l11409"></a>smaller vessels such as men could  make in the beginning.

There navigation <a id="l11412"></a>had its rise &amp; was propagated thence to the mediterranean.

<p id="par1540">Herodotus tells us that the Phenicians were the authors of dissention who coming from the red sea to the Medi<a id="l11422"></a>terranean &amp; seating themselves  on the sea coasts of Syria, quickly  undertook long <a id="l11423"></a>voyages &amp;  in carrying of Egyptian &amp; Assyrian  wares passed over to other coasts &amp;  chiefly <a id="l11424"></a>to Argos.

That the Phenicians coming hither exposed <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p201v"> &lt;201v&gt; </span> their merchandize &amp; after 5 or 6 days when they had sold almost all, certain weomen came to <a id="l11425"></a> the sea amongst which was Io the daughter of Inachus, &amp; whilst they bought what <a id="l11426"></a>they liked, the Phenicians set upon them &amp; seizing Io &amp; some others  carried <a id="l11427"></a>them into their ship &amp; sailed into Egypt, &amp; this was the beginning of injuries. That <a id="l11428"></a>in requital of this injury some Greeks  of the Island Crete afterwards coming to Tyre carried away Europa <a id="l11429"></a>&amp; a while after the Greeks committed also a second injury in carrying away Medea  from Colchos. And <a id="l11430"></a>when the King of Colchos sent an Embasador to demand his daughter back &amp; that the raptors <a id="l11431"></a>might be punished, the Greeks answered that as they (viz<sup>t</sup> the Egyptians of whom the kingdom <a id="l11432"></a>of Colchos was a colony) had not punished the raptors of Io so neither would the Greeks <a id="l11433"></a>punish  those of Medea. In the next age Paris stole Helena &amp; these things occasion<a id="l11434"></a>ed the ruin of Troy.  From this passage of Herodotus  <a id="l11435"></a>it appears that the navigation of the Phœnician merchants to Greece began upon <a id="l11436"></a>their coming from the red sea &amp; by consequence that the rapture of Io &amp; Europa <a id="l11437"></a>was not ancienter then the reign of David.  The Sidonians  might have ships before, but it doth not appear that they sailed as <a id="l11439"></a>far as Greece before the  merchants of Edom  were driven by <a id="l11440"></a>David from their  trade upon the red sea &amp; deprived of their estates &amp; country &amp; thereby necessitated  to  seek out a new trade <a id="l11441"></a>upon the Mediterranean for getting a livelyhood.</p>

And there  is the same reason to beleive that the solemnities of the rest of the Egyptian Gods observed in the severall parts of Egypt had their rise from his institutions &amp; by consequence the conventions for such solemnities were as old as his days. For we are told by  Sanchoniatho that he invented the figures of the <a id="l11502"></a>Gods of  Egypt &amp; by Diodorus that he  ordeined the worship <a id="l11503"></a>&amp;  sacrifices of these Gods &amp;   by Artaphanus that he divided  Ægypt into 36 <a id="l11504"></a>Nomi &amp; assigned to each their rites of worshipping the Deity.  ffor all Egypt did not worship all  Mercuries Gods <a id="l11508"></a> but  in one Convention they worshipped one God in another <a id="l11509"></a>another, each with his proper ceremonies &amp; worship. For Herodo<a id="l11510"></a>tus tells us they worshipped not the same Gods except Osiris &amp; <a id="l11511"></a>Isis. In the rest of their Gods they were divided, every Temple having <a id="l11512"></a>its territory of worshippers &amp; its proper God &amp; way of worship, [And <a id="l11513"></a>where Mercury instituted the  worship of his Gods <a id="l11514"></a>there no doubt that worship continued till the extirpation of heathenism <a id="l11515"></a>by Christianity.] Neare Thebes &amp; the Lake Mœris the Crocodile was account<a id="l11516"></a>ed sacred, in other places it was persecuted as  prophane &amp; hostile. <a id="l11517"></a>The Mendesians in their Temple worshipped a Goat &amp; the God Pan &amp; sacri<a id="l11518"></a>ficed Rams &amp; on the contrary the Thebans &amp; Ammonians in theirs <a id="l11519"></a>worshipped Rams &amp; sacrificed Goats. In Pamprem the people of the subordinate <a id="l11520"></a>cities celebrated the festival of Mars with a formal fight with clubs. In the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p202v"> &lt;202v&gt; </span> 
ffeast at Busiris after they had sacrificed they beat themselves &amp; some cut <a id="l11521"></a>their foreheads with swords. In Sais they celebrated the ffeast with  piping <a id="l11522"></a>&amp; singing  &amp; clapping of hands &amp; reviling the cities through <a id="l11523"></a>which they passed. In Heliopolis &amp; Buti they only sacrificed to their proper Gods. And what <a id="l11524"></a>ever Gods or solemnities  Mercury at first set on <a id="l11525"></a>foot among them no doubt they retained as obstinately  as the people <a id="l11526"></a>in our  age do the several religions they are bought up in</p>
<p id="par1545">Plutarch tells us of several conjectures about  the <a id="l11527"></a>occasion of this variety. Some say, saith he, that Osiris divided his army <a id="l11528"></a>into certain troop – – – – – fell upon them both. Thus far Plutarch. And <a id="l11529"></a>this confirms that there was such a variety of religions among them <a id="l11530"></a>as we speak of: but the occasion of it was doubtless the same as in <a id="l11531"></a>the neighbouring countries.

Its probable that after the death of Thoth <a id="l11541"></a>many common councils  for strengthening themselves might <a id="l11542"></a>agree to set up over the captains of their several forces a superior <a id="l11543"></a>captain who in time of danger might command them all  <a id="l11544"></a> after the manner that Cecrops &amp; his successors was Captain <a id="l11545"></a>of the forces of the 12 head cities of Attica.  And as Theseus afterwards united <a id="l11547"></a>these 12 cities in Athens, so might the Captains of Egypt unite their <a id="l11548"></a>head cities of their Nomi into greater  polities [in Thebes, This, Memphis &amp; Heliopolis] &amp; thereby reduce <a id="l11549"></a>all Egypt into four or five kingdoms before the days of Abraham. And that the lower Egypt was very early either by compact or by war reduced into one Kingdom seems to appear by the History of Ioseph</p>

<p id="par1605">Historians tell us that Agenor the father of Cadmus &amp; Europa <a id="l11777"></a>was brother to Belus the father of Ægyptus &amp; Danaus &amp; Manetho <a id="l11778"></a>tells us that Ægyptus &amp; Danaus were Sethosis &amp;  Armais:  <a id="l11780"></a>&amp; that Sethosis  having forces by land &amp; sea left the government of Egypt <a id="l11781"></a>to his brother Armais while he invaded &amp; conquered Cyprus Phœnicia  Media <a id="l11782"></a>Persia &amp; other oriental nations. Whence its plain that this Sethosis was the <a id="l11783"></a>same man with Sesostris &amp; that he &amp; Danaus were contemporaries to Cadmus <a id="l11784"></a>&amp; Europa &amp; by consequence to Solomon, &amp; therefore Sethosis or Sesostris can <a id="l11785"></a>be no other king of Egypt then that Sesac to whom Ieroboam fled in <a id="l11786"></a>the reign of Solomon &amp; who  presently after Solomons death invaded <a id="l11787"></a> Iudea &amp; spoiled the Temple. I do not affirm that <a id="l11788"></a>Cadmus &amp; Sesostris were so nearly related as this genealogy represents but I  <a id="l11789"></a>say that the genealogy be it true or false is very ancient &amp; is grounded upon the <a id="l11790"></a>synchronism of Cadmus &amp; Sesostris. And the same  synchronism may be also gathered <a id="l11791"></a>from hence that Memnon who  was two generations later then Sesostris <a id="l11792"></a>was contemporary to the war of Troy as shall be shewn hereafter.</p>
<p id="par1606">Diodorus tells us that the Egyptians had  these lawmakers <a id="l11793"></a>Mnevis, Sasyches, Sesostris,  Boccharis &amp; Amasis,  &amp; that Sasyches made excellent laws relating to the honour  &amp; worship of the Gods &amp; found out Geometry &amp; taught Astronomy.

Sasyches is the <a id="l11802"></a>same name with Sesach &amp; I take him to be the same   man with <a id="l11803"></a>Sesostris next named, because it was Sesostris who by dividing Egypt into equal squares gave a begin<a id="l11804"></a>ning to Geometry, &amp; if they be not the same  Sesostris by this record must be later then Sesac <a id="l11805"></a>, whereas all historians make him either the same or an earlier king.</p>

But however he lets us understand  that <a id="l11829"></a>when the shepherds were expelled Egypt they  returned into Phœnicia <a id="l11830"></a>their original country &amp; there seated themselves &amp; that this was done before <a id="l11831"></a>the seventh year of David.

<p id="par1609">And hence I seem to gather that the shepherds upon retiring out of <a id="l11834"></a>Egypt    mixed in great numbers   with the Philistims their next neighbours &amp; by this conjunction <a id="l11835"></a> inabled them  to invade &amp; conquere all Phœnicia, <a id="l11836"></a> ffor the Philistims in those <a id="l11837"></a>days grew very potent &amp; conquered the Israelites &amp; reigned long over them  even from the <a id="l11838"></a>days of Sampson  &amp; though Samuel obteined a victory over them  yet they  were  lords over Israel when Saul was annointed King 1 Sam 9.16 &amp; at that time they suffered not <a id="l11839"></a>a Smith to be in all the land of Israel least the Israelites should make them <a id="l11840"></a>swords &amp; spears, &amp; when Ionathan smote one of their Garrisons, they brought into the feild against Saul thirty thousand chariots <a id="l11841"></a>&amp; six thousand horsmen &amp; people as the sand on the sea shore in multitude <a id="l11842"></a>1 Sam. 13. And from this their dominion over  all the land of Canaan   the whole country acquired the names of Palestine &amp; Phœnicia that <a id="l11844"></a>is the land of the Philistims,  &amp; Phœnicians. For these w Bochart derives the name of Phœnicians from בני ענה  Bene Anak (that is children of Anak) &amp; by contraction Beank or Pheanac, &amp; the children of Anak remained only in the cities of the Philistims (Ios 11.22) &amp; growing into one people with them gave their name to the nation.  Their dominion lasted till David  beat them in many battels &amp; at the same time took Ierusalem from the Iebusites &amp; built it by the assistance <a id="l11852"></a>of Hiram king of Tyre.  Which might well give occasion <a id="l11854"></a>to Manetho to reccon Ierusalem built by the shepherds  he knowing no other originall of the Israelites then from this kingdom of the Phœnicians. ffor  some of the ancients recconed the Israelites to be a  <a id="l11856"></a> part  of the Phœnicians, as Herodotus where he  represents that in  Palestine some of the Phœnicians <a id="l11857"></a> were circumcised [ Euterpe c 104.]</p>

Probably it was when the  Philistims <a id="l11864"></a>by the accession of the Shepherds out of Egypt began to be potent. Sidon thus <a id="l11865"></a>coming into the hands of the Philistims  &amp; being in those days the principal <a id="l11866"></a>city trading by sea was by the Greeks celebrated as the head city of Phœnicia <a id="l11867"></a>so that the inhabitants of the sea coasts of Phœnicia were anciently called Sido<a id="l11868"></a>nians.

And this seems to have ben the original of dividing a circle into <a id="l11971"></a>360  degrees.// At length  the Ancients observed that the 13<sup>th</sup> month <a id="l11972"></a> was to be added thrice in eight years  or thereabouts &amp; by that  means they became <a id="l11974"></a>able to keep a recconning  by lunar months <a id="l11975"></a>without  correcting the year by the seasons <a id="l11976"></a>of  spring &amp; autumn summer &amp; winter above once in  8 years &amp; this  Octaeris <a id="l11977"></a>the Phœnicians seem to have brought out of Egypt into Greece it being <a id="l11978"></a> the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n199-ref">[199]</sup>

For Herodotus tells us that the Greeks had their <a id="l11982"></a> ffestivals &amp; Oracles from Egypt. </p>
<p id="par1624">At length the Egyptians began to   count the number of days in <a id="l11987"></a>the year &amp; because they were reputed to be 360, they  counted <a id="l11988"></a>them by filling  360 bowles with milk &amp; thus keeping a recconing by <a id="l11989"></a>years of 360 days they soon found this year too short by about 5 days. <a id="l11990"></a>This ceremony of counting the 360 days  being <a id="l11991"></a>performed  with mourning &amp; lamentation in the sepulchre of Osyris was doubtles a funeral rite in honour to his memory <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p213r"> &lt;213r&gt; </span> &amp;  signifies that he was the author of observing the revolutions of the sun &amp; counting the days in order to find the true length <a id="l11992"></a>of the year. And this gave a beginning to Astronomy. ffor while men recconed <a id="l11993"></a>only by summers &amp; winters &amp; lunar months or by years of 360 days &amp; months of 30 days &amp; knew not the just number of <a id="l11994"></a>days in the solar year, the motions of the Planets could not be compu<a id="l11995"></a>ted from Observations for want of knowing the just number of days <a id="l11996"></a>between the Observations. You heard that Sasyches or Sesostris here called Osiris taught <a id="l11997"></a>Astronomy &amp; that his sacred scribe Mercury was the first that observed the motion of the stars <a id="l11998"></a>&amp; invented Arithmetick (an Art necessary to Astronomy) &amp; instituted sacred funeral rites in memory of the great works of Osiris &amp; this monument <a id="l11999"></a>confirms it.</p>



<p id="par1628">This  form of the Octaeris among the Greeks seems to have been  by adding a month to <a id="l12014"></a>every other year except once in 8 years. ffor it appears out of Herodotus <a id="l12015"></a>Censorinus &amp; Geminus that  the old Greek years were <a id="l12016"></a>alternately of 12 &amp; 13 months.  Two of these years therefore made the Diete<a id="l12017"></a>ris of the Ancients consisting three times of 25 lunar months &amp; once of 24 &amp; four of <a id="l12018"></a>them made the Tetraeris consisting of 49 &amp; 50 lunar months alternately, &amp; the <a id="l12019"></a>Omission of the intercalary month every eighth year made the Octaeris con<a id="l12020"></a>sisting of 99 Lunar Months .  ffor the Months  were still defined <a id="l12021"></a> by the  returns of the Moon, [excepting that when they were to reccon  <a id="l12022"></a>times past or to come they took  the round number of 30 days <a id="l12023"></a>to a month as we find done by Herodotus.]  ffor  <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n202-ref">[202]</sup> Solon commanded the Athenians to count the days by the Moon &amp; called the  day of the new moon ενην καὶ νέαν the old &amp; the new, referring to the old month that part of the day which preceded the conjunction &amp; the rest of the day to the new. And Geminus tells us that  <a id="l12025"></a>all the Greeks by their laws &amp; the dictates of their Oracles made their years <a id="l12026"></a>agree with the course of the Sun &amp; their months &amp; days of the month with the course of the Moon <a id="l12027"></a>so that the same sacrifices might always fall upon the same seasons of the year. And <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n203-ref">[203]</sup> Cicero that the Sicilians &amp; other Greeks to make their days &amp; months agree which the courses of the Sun &amp; Moon sometimes tooke away a day or two from the month &amp; sometimes made the month longer by one or two days. And <a id="l12028"></a>this seems to have been the state of the year when the nations defined the length <a id="l12029"></a>of their years &amp; months  by the visible courses of the Sun &amp; Moon &amp; counted only <a id="l12030"></a>the days of the  Moon &amp; the  Moons in the year, &amp; took it for granted that <a id="l12031"></a>the year consisted of  360 days or thereabouts without counting all the days.</p>
<p id="par1629">But at length when the nations grew more curious &amp; began to count the days in the whole year in order <a id="l12032"></a>to find out its just length,  they soon made new regulations of the year for computing time <a id="l12033"></a>more exactly. X And first the Egyptians counted the revolutions of 360 days by filling so many bowls <a id="l12034"></a>with milk &amp; by this means  f<span class="overline">in</span>ding this year too short for the course of the Sun <a id="l12035"></a>by about 5 days they  soon  formed a year  of 365 days as shall be explained here<a id="l12036"></a>after.

<p id="par1630" class="i0">And because  before the invention of Astronomy the nations determined the beginning <a id="l12037"></a>of their Months by the first appearance of the new moon thence it came to pass that <a id="l12038"></a>the Israelites Arabians, Sabæans Egyptians Greeks, Latins &amp; other ancient nations celebrated the new Moons &amp; some of them the full Moons <a id="l12039"></a>with rejoycing &amp; festivals  (which gave occasion to  the worship of the Moon among the <a id="l12040"></a>Gentiles) &amp;  that  some nations as the Israelites, Arabians, &amp; Athenians  began their day in the evening <a id="l12041"></a>the time when the new moon first appeared.  And because the <a id="l12044"></a>year exceeded 12 lunar months thence it  became a custome with all nations in the first ages <a id="l12045"></a> (so far as we have any notice of their years  to  intercale a Month, &amp; on this custome is grownded the Law of Moses<sup class="note" id="n204-ref">[204]</sup> that the Israe<a id="l12046"></a>lites who upon the 14<sup>th</sup> day of the first Month were unclean or in a journey should <a id="l12047"></a>keep the Passover on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of the next Month Num 9.11.   David indeed appointed but 12 captains <a id="l12056"></a>for all the Months of the year a captain for a month, whence some think that the old civil <a id="l12057"></a>year of the Iews had but 12 months &amp; by consequence that the months were not lunar: but the intercalary month being called by the same name <a id="l12058"></a>with the 12<sup>th</sup> month might be looked upon as comprehended in the  twelve &amp; being an extraordi<a id="l12059"></a>nary month might have some extraordinary provision made for it not mentioned in scripture. <a id="l12060"></a></p>
<p id="par1631">Besides these Luni-solar years which the ancients used in their religious &amp; civil affairs they <a id="l12062"></a>had  another year  fitted for computation, which  may therefore be called their <a id="l12063"></a>arithmetical year. ffor as often as they were to reccon times past or to come or were to <a id="l12064"></a>summ up the days or months in any number of years, in doing  – – into 360 <a id="l12065"></a>degrees. But it is not to be suppposed that any nation used such  yeares  or months in reli<a id="l12066"></a>gious  or civil affairs. ffor  the beginning of such a year would in seventy years have run round the <a id="l12067"></a>  4 seasons of the solar year &amp; thereby have discovered  the difference between this &amp; the solar year  much sooner then it was known. And  Months of 30 days would in a  year or two have notoriously disagreed from the course of the Moon. When therefore Herodotus &amp; others reccon by months of <a id="l12072"></a>30 days  or Geminus tells  us that the months of the  ancients consisted of 30 <a id="l12073"></a>days, they are  to be understood  of the Arithmetical months,  which the <a id="l12074"></a>ancients in applying   them to civil uses   made  shorter or longer by a <a id="l12075"></a>day or two as often as the course of the Moon required so that their  <a id="l12076"></a>months &amp; years might constantly agree with the heavens.</p>

<p id="par1634">For the whole Assyrian Monarchy rose up out of such litle kingdoms <a id="l12087"></a>as these not long before the captivity of the ten tribes. Herodotus tells us it <a id="l12088"></a>stood 500 years:  according to which recconing it must have risen <a id="l12089"></a> about 390 years before that captivity. And perhaps  Nineveh <a id="l12090"></a>might then begin to flourish but was not yet very considerable.  For in the history of Sesostris or Sheshach  &amp; his successors who invaded all the east there is not one word of the Assyrian Monarchy The Prophet <a id="l12094"></a>Ionas – – – – – all its neighbours round about.  The King of Assyria till then <a id="l12095"></a> according to the ancient custome when cities were kingdoms is called only king of Nineveh (Ionas 3.6)  but after <a id="l12097"></a> wards when he had conquered all Assyria with the regions round about he is constantly called <a id="l12098"></a>King of Assyria. After this Monarchy was grown up  tis mentioned <a id="l12099"></a>in the scriptures in the reign of almost every King, in those of  Phul &amp; Tiglathpileser &amp;  <a id="l12100"></a>Salmanasser &amp;  Senacherib &amp; Assarhadon  Kings of Assyria &amp; afterwards in those of Manasses &amp; <a id="l12101"></a>Iosias kings of Iudah: but before the reign of Phul there is not one word <a id="l12102"></a>of  it in all the scriptures.  <a id="l12105"></a>Seing therefore Senacherib  threatned the Iews with those armies  which <a id="l12106"></a>in the days of his fathers had destroyed all nations &amp; both he &amp; the Prophets <a id="l12107"></a>speak of those  conquests as then fresh in mens memory,  we may reccon that they <a id="l12108"></a>were made in the days of those great warriors Pul Tiglathpileser &amp; Salmanasser,  the fathers of Senacherib. Ieroboam the second King of Israel having conquered the kingdoms of Damascus &amp; Hamath, when his successor  Manehen came to the crown he conquered Tiphsah or Tipsac a  City with its territory upon Eu<a id="l12111"></a>phrates  adjoyning to Carchemish.  Whence it seems that  the <a id="l12112"></a>kingdom of Assyria did not yet extend so far. But soon after Pul <a id="l12113"></a>made   war in those parts &amp; caused  Menahen to <a id="l12114"></a> buy his peace. If in that expedition  Pul conquered  <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> to Euphrates &amp; subdued Carchemish (for he seems to have gone no further<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>)<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> we may reccon that he be<a id="l12115"></a>gan about that time to grow great. ffor  Carchemish  lay chiefly if not wholy in Mesopotamia &amp;  was conquered  before that of Calneh  <a id="l12116"></a>(<span class="hspac-n" title="7 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) &amp;  the regions of Mesopotamia &amp; Calomitis  being  nearest to Assyria  may be recconed among the first conquests <a id="l12118"></a>of the Assyrians. For all these reasons therefore I begin this Monarchy <a id="l12119"></a>with the reign of Pul, there being no evidence of an earlier  <a id="l12120"></a>epocha.  For I pass by the writings of the fabulous Ctesias &amp;  his followers who make Ninus the founder of this Monarchy. Kir, Kirne Carine</p>

<p id="par1636" class="i0">All these nations  had till now  their  several Gods  &amp; each accounted his  God <a id="l12122"></a>God of his own land &amp; Nation &amp;  the defender thereof from the <a id="l12123"></a>Gods of the neighbouring countries (2 King. 26.29, 30, 31. &amp; 27.33, 34, 35 2 Chron <a id="l12124"></a>32.15) &amp;  therefore they were never  before  subject to one common <a id="l12125"></a>government: but now being small kingdoms, the king of Assyria easily  overflowed them <a id="l12126"></a>. Know ye not, saith Sennacherib to the Iews,  what I &amp; my fathers – <a id="l12127"></a>He &amp; his fathers therefore  Salmanasser, Tiglathpileser &amp; Phul were all <a id="l12128"></a>of them great conquerors &amp;  with a current of victories set <a id="l12129"></a>up this monarchy.

Had it been great <a id="l12148"></a>before  I see not why it should not <a id="l12149"></a>have been mentioned as often then as now.</p>
<p id="par1637">Another instance of this  kind we have in the 12 sons of Ishmael. <a id="l12150"></a>ffor when Moses had named them he subjoyns.

<p id="par1638">The  first of these conquerors we read of is Pul,   <a id="l12154"></a>In his days the Kings of Israel had conquered  the Kingdoms of Dan &amp; Ham &amp; extending <a id="l12155"></a>their victories to Euphrates destroyed Thipsac with its territories.

At Thipsac there was a fordable place of Euphrates &amp; Carchemish stood on the other side the river.    Whence   it seems that this <a id="l12160"></a>expedition of Pul was designed against  the Cities of Mesop. that by his victories  he was grown terri<a id="l12161"></a>ble to the King of Israel &amp; that he had newly conquered the Kingdom of Carchemish   when he <a id="l12162"></a>came over Euphrates.

Seing therefore Pul &amp; his  successors T.

<p id="par1643">In Greece Homer reccons up 29 several nations which sent their <a id="l12211"></a>armies against Troy each under the command of  its Prince &amp; some under the command of more then one.   One of these nations was the Kingdom of  <a id="l12214"></a>Athens  another that of the Argives or My<a id="l12215"></a>cenæ a third that of Arcadia. Their kings, who were Menestheus  &amp; Aga<a id="l12216"></a>memnon &amp; Agapenor, led their forces against Troy.  The rest were either Kingdoms or aggregates of free Cities or  small kingdoms <a id="l12219"></a>not yet well united into one government. For Pausanias [lib 9. p. 1] tells us that all Greece <a id="l12220"></a>was at first governed by Kings before common wealths were in<a id="l12221"></a>stituted. [And because every city was at first free &amp; absolute <a id="l12222"></a>thence it came to pass that the word πολιτεία <em class="underline">polity</em> which signifies <a id="l12223"></a>the government of a City was taken by the greeks for the government <a id="l12224"></a>of a kingdom or any other absolute government] By the original <a id="l12225"></a>&amp; ancient constitution of the kingdoms of Athens,  Mycens &amp; Arcadia you may under<a id="l12226"></a>stand that of the rest. That of Athens is thus set down by <a id="l12227"></a>Thucydides. Vnder Cecrops, saith he, &amp; the ancient K.</p>
<p id="par1644">One of the twelve nations were the Macedonians. They <a id="l12228"></a>were not of this council in the beginning but were admitted <a id="l12229"></a>afterwards in the room of the Phocians who were struck out <a id="l12230"></a>for  sacrilege.  Iustin tells us that the ancient Macedonia  was a small <a id="l12231"></a>region &amp; its People  a branch of the Pelasgi &amp; Pliny saith it  was composed of 150 <a id="l12232"></a>peoples; I suppose he means δήμοι towns. Out of these towns at length  <a id="l12233"></a>arose cities &amp; little kingdoms. ffor Iustin tells us that when Caranus <a id="l12234"></a>led a large colony of Greeks thither (which was about 90 years before the captivity of the 10 Tribes), he <em class="underline">first seized the  City AEdessa &amp; <a id="l12235"></a>then expelling  Midas the king of a certain part of Macedon &amp; afterwards <a id="l12236"></a>other kings he succeeded in the room of them all, &amp;  thus uniting the <a id="l12237"></a>nations of various peoples he first of all made one body of Macedonia</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p215v"> &lt;215v&gt; </span> <em class="underline">&amp; founded that kingdom which at length by subduing first its neighbours then other <a id="l12238"></a>nations propagated its dominion ot the  furthest parts of the east</em> &amp; became <a id="l12239"></a>the third great Monarchy. Herodotus makes  not Caranus but Perdiccas the son of <a id="l12240"></a>Caranus to be the founder of this  Kingdom, &amp; describes the Kings of <a id="l12241"></a> those times poore &amp; mean  below the degrees of subjects <a id="l12242"></a>in later ages so that their meat was cookt for their family by their own Queens.</p>
<p id="par1645">The rise of kingdoms in Italy was like that in other places. ffor <a id="l12243"></a>Dionysius – called Sicily. </p>
<p id="par1646">Out of  such walled towns as these arose afterwards divers kingdoms in Italy <a id="l12244"></a>amongst which the Aborigines or Latines for a long time  made but a small figure  They  had a king before the Trojan war, but without <a id="l12249"></a>an union under him. For about 32 years after that war Ascanius built the city Alba &amp; <a id="l12250"></a> instituted there a council of all the cities under him  with sacrifices to Iupiter: <a id="l12251"></a>in the time of which solemnity one of the  young men of best note governed <a id="l12252"></a>the city. This Council was no doubt for uniting the Cities.  The Vestal fire was also kept in  Alba. This kingdom <a id="l12253"></a>continued about 400 years, &amp; then Romulus  with a few Latines laid the foundations of Rome about 20 miles from <a id="l12254"></a>Alba,   Strabo l 5 p 229, 230 tells us that <em class="underline">The Æqui, Volsci,  &amp; some Aborigines  <a id="l12256"></a>&amp; the Rutili &amp;  other greater &amp; lesser cities dwelt about Rome when it <a id="l12257"></a>was first built, &amp; that they dwelt there freely  village by village without being subject to  any common  nation. – &amp; that  Romulus <a id="l12259"></a>built Rome in a place  assumed not by choice but by constraint <a id="l12260"></a> which was neither fortified by nature nor had ground <a id="l12261"></a>enough to supply the city nor men to inhabit it.  For  <a id="l12262"></a>the inhabitants of the Region lived each apart, &amp; reached to the very walls of <a id="l12263"></a>the city &amp; regarded not the Albani. Such were Collatia, Antemnæ, Fidenæ, <a id="l12264"></a>Lavinium &amp; other such like  small cities not above 4 or 5 miles from Rome</em>. <a id="l12265"></a>To get men therefore he built an Asylum which drew a conflux of <a id="l12266"></a>people,   &amp; with these he warred with the King of the <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">Sabines</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">Quirites</span></span> at Lavinium <a id="l12268"></a>&amp; by compact  inherited his kingdom &amp; being now grown strong it may be presumed <a id="l12269"></a>that other little free cities round about easily complied with him.

It <a id="l12384"></a>seems to me therefore that  Apis &amp; Epopeus are the same king.  Epopeus is <a id="l12385"></a>Epaphus &amp; Epaphus is Apis. ffor they tell us that Apis  went into Egypt <a id="l12386"></a>&amp; became the great God of the Egyptians  called Apis Epaphus Serapis &amp; Osiris. <a id="l12387"></a></p>

And the year <a id="l12669"></a>before this siege began, David vanquished the children of Ammon  &amp; their confederates the Syrians of Zobah &amp; Rehob &amp; Ishtob <a id="l12670"></a>&amp; Maacah &amp; Damascus extending his dominion over all those nations as far as to the <a id="l12671"></a>river of Euphrates &amp; the entring in of Hamath . And before this war began he  smote  <a id="l12673"></a>Moab &amp; Amaleck &amp; Edom &amp; made the Edomites fly, some of them into Egypt with their king then <a id="l12674"></a>a little child &amp;  others to the Philistims, &amp; to other places whether they could escape. <a id="l12675"></a>And before this he had several battels with the Philistims.

And thus  the coming of the Phenicians with Cadmus  into Asia <a id="l12687"></a>minor &amp; Europe  will fall upon the beginning of the reign <a id="l12688"></a>of Abibalus  For they came all of them from Sidon <a id="l12689"></a>to seek new seats, &amp; therefore were driven from thence by their ene<a id="l12690"></a>mies.

But <a id="l12774"></a>in the reign of Iehoram the son of Iehosaphat Edom revolted  <a id="l12775"></a>from under the Dominion of Iudah &amp; made themselves a king, &amp; the <a id="l12776"></a>trade of Iudah &amp; Tyre upon the red sea being interrupted, the Tyrians <a id="l12777"></a>began to make long voyages upon the Mediterranean to places not <a id="l12778"></a>yet frequented by the Sidonians, some of them going with Dido to the coasts of Afric beyonde <a id="l12779"></a>the Syrtes &amp; building Carthage, others going to the coasts of Spaine &amp;  even beyond the mouth of the <a id="l12781"></a>straits. And  from the flight of the Edomites from David &amp; of the Tyrians from   the new king of Edom arose the opinion of the ancients  that the Phenicians <a id="l12782"></a><sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n213-ref">[213]</sup> came originally from the red sea to the Mediterranean &amp; there presently <a id="l12783"></a>undertook long voyages.</p>
<p id="par1736">Strabo mentioning the first men who leaving the sea coasts <a id="l12784"></a>ventured out into the deep &amp; undertook long voiages – – – of the <a id="l12785"></a>Trojan war</p>

<p id="par1739" class="i0">Teucer the son of Telamon,  seven years after that war according to the Marbles, arrived at Troy, &amp; there <a id="l12790"></a> built Salamis &amp;  he &amp; his posterity reigned there till the days of Evagoras <a id="l12791"></a>who was  expelled by the Persians</p>
<p id="par1740">I have now carried up the antiquities of Greece as high as to the coming of Cadmus <a id="l12792"></a>with Colonies of Phœnicians into Greece &amp; to the first use of letters  in Europe &amp;  iron tools the foundation of manual arts &amp; to the <a id="l12793"></a>first plowing &amp; sowing &amp; the first building of temples. And before all this Greece &amp; all <a id="l12794"></a>Europe must have been in a very barbarous &amp; uncivilized condition; even more barbarous <a id="l12795"></a>&amp; rude then the Americans were when  we first discovered them.

<p id="par1741">In the time of the Argonautic expedition Castor &amp; Pollux were  very <a id="l12797"></a>young men &amp;  their sisters Helena &amp; Clytemnestra <a id="l12798"></a>were children &amp; their wives Phœbe &amp; Ilaira were also very young. <a id="l12799"></a>All these with the Argonauts Lynceus &amp; Idas were the grandchildren of Gorgo<a id="l12800"></a>phone the daughter of Perseus, the son of Danae the daughter of Acrisius &amp; Eurydice.

<p id="par1745">Ib. l. ult. scribe And  from these circumstances, it may be gathered that Cadmus &amp; Europa came <a id="l12828"></a>into Greece about three ordinary generations or an hundred years before the Argo<a id="l12829"></a>nautic expedition, that is, about the  middle of Davids <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>reign<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> or  a very litle before;  &amp; that Epopeus or Apis was slain &amp; Amphion &amp; Zetus born about the <a id="l12831"></a>end of Davids reign; [&amp; that Laius recovered this kingdom  of Thebes about the end of <a id="l12832"></a>the reign of Solomon.]</p>
<p id="par1746">Trogus in his 18<sup>th</sup> book tells us: <em class="underline">A rege Ascaloniorum expugnati Sidonij <a id="l12833"></a>navibus appulsi Tyrum urbe ante annum Trojanæ cladis  condiderunt</em>. And Strabo (l. 16) <em class="underline">Aradus was built by men who fled from Sidon</em> <a id="l12834"></a>Hence Isaiah calls <em class="underline">Tyre the daughter of Zidon, the inhabitants of the <a id="l12835"></a>isle whom the merchants of  Zidon have replenished</em>.

The new inhabitants of Tyre had not yet lost the <a id="l12841"></a>name of Zidonians nor had the old inhabitants (if there were any <a id="l12842"></a>considerable number of them) gained the reputation of the new ones <a id="l12843"></a>for skill in hewing of timber, as they would have done had shipping <a id="l12844"></a>been long in use at Tyre. This was the state of Tyre in the beginning of the reign of Solomon.  Hiram was then King of Tyre &amp;  his  reign began (according to Iosephus) in the 33<sup>th</sup> year of the reign of David.       And he much enlarged the <a id="l12849"></a>city &amp; adorned it with new Temples &amp; other structures (as uses to be done <a id="l12850"></a>in cities when they become the head cities of new kingdoms) &amp; his father Abibalus is the first king of Tyre mentioned in history, &amp; hence we may  reccon that the Sidonians built Tyre in the reign of these two kings &amp; by consequence in the reign of David &amp; Solomon, &amp; that Sidon was taken in the reign of David.   [the Sidonians fled from  the king <a id="l12853"></a>of Ascalon to Tyre  under   the conduct  of Abibalus, &amp; by consequence in <a id="l12854"></a>the reign of David. For Hiram began to reign (according to Iosephus) in the three &amp; thirtieth year of Davids reign] And when  some of the Zidonians fled by sea to Tyre &amp; others <a id="l12855"></a>to Aradus, it is reasonable to beleive that others fled by  sea to  such <a id="l12856"></a>other places  as they had been acquainted with by means of their <a id="l12857"></a>trafique, as to Asia Minor, Greece &amp; Libya. ffor when Cadmus &amp; other <a id="l12858"></a>Phenician commanders came with colonies into Asia Minor, Greece &amp; Libya. ffor when Cadmus &amp; other <a id="l12859"></a>Phenician commanders came with colonies into Asia minor &amp; Greece &amp; the  <a id="l12860"></a>neighbouring islands,  others fled with colonies to Libya &amp; there built <a id="l12861"></a>many cities, as Nonnus affirms.

<p id="par1802">I have now carried up the Chronology of the Greeks – caves of the earth.</p>
<p id="par1803">In the  second year of the reign of Saul the Philistims brought into the field against him <a id="l12901"></a>thirty thousand chariots &amp; six thousand horsmen &amp; foot without number, whereas in the days <a id="l12902"></a>of Moses al the chariots of Egypt with which Pharaoh pursued Israel were but six hundred Exod XIV.7.  ffrom the great army of the <a id="l12903"></a>Philistims I  seem to gather that the shepherds had newly relinquished <a id="l12904"></a>Egypt &amp;  joyned them . They might be beaten &amp; driven out of the greatest part of Egypt <a id="l12905"></a>&amp; shut up in Abaris by Mephramuthosis in the latter end of the days of Eli &amp; some of them then fly to <a id="l12906"></a>the Philistims &amp; strengthen them against Israel. And from the Philistims some of them <a id="l12907"></a>might escapte to Zidon &amp; from Zidon  by sea to  other places. And after<a id="l12908"></a>wards in the beginning of the reign  of Saul the shepherds which remained in Egypt might be forced by Thummosis or Amosis <a id="l12909"></a>the son of Misphramuthosis to leave Abaris &amp; retire also to the Philistims. And upon these <a id="l12910"></a> <a id="l12933"></a>occasions several of them, as Pelasgus, Cecrops, Inachus,  &amp; Lelex, might <a id="l12934"></a>come from Egypt by sea to Sidon,  &amp; Cyprus &amp; thence to  <a id="l12935"></a>Asia minor &amp; Greece in the days of Eli, Samuel &amp; Saul, &amp; thereby begin to <a id="l12936"></a>open a commerce between Greece &amp; Sidon before the coming of the Phenicians <a id="l12937"></a>from the red sea. Pelasgus reigned in Arcadia &amp; was the father of Lycaon (according to Pherecides <a id="l12938"></a>Atheniensis) &amp; Lycaon dyed  just before the flood of Deucalion. He sacrificed children &amp; therefore was one of the shepherds.

<p id="par1833">After the death of Sesostris the Æthiopians &amp; Lybians  rising from their <a id="l13216"></a>seats under Zara their king made an impresion upon the southern  Egypt &amp; thence with an army of  a thousand thousand <a id="l13217"></a>men &amp; three hundred Chariots invaded Iudea in the 15 year of the reign of Asa. But while they were <a id="l13218"></a>in Egypt, Asa having peace  on all sides  (which was for ten years together)  had prepared himself by abolishing Idolatry &amp; seeking the Lord &amp; fortifying all the cities of Iudah with walls &amp; towers &amp; arming his people &amp; then met them in the borders of Iudea &amp; then met them <a id="l13219"></a>with an army of five hundred &amp; eighty thousand men &amp;  smote them <a id="l13220"></a>with a great overthrow so that they could not recover themselves. (2 Chron. ch 14 <a id="l13221"></a>&amp; 16.8)  To this war Diodorus relates  (lib. 3 p <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) where speaking of the people of interior Afric he saith <em class="underline">Tis <a id="l13225"></a>reported that they  once making an impression into Egypt <a id="l13226"></a>made a great part of the land void of its inhabitants</em>. And Eusebius  where he saith that in the reign of Amenophis <em class="underline">the Ethiopians rising from the river Indus seated themselves <a id="l13228"></a>by Egypt</em>. (Euseb. n. 402.)  Yet Eusebius is mistaken in fetching these Æthiopians <a id="l13229"></a>from the river Indus. Those Ethiopians  had lank or straight haire, these above Egypt were <a id="l13230"></a>crisped above all men. (Herod l. 7. c. 70.) &amp; had Libyans mixed with them. The mistake seems to have risen from <a id="l13231"></a>the name of India  given by the ancients to remote unknown regions as well southward <a id="l13232"></a>as eastward. To the same war Manetho seems to relate in the following <a id="l13233"></a>passage recorded by Iosephus. – – – <br><br></p>
<p id="par1834">Here Manetho seems  out of  ill will to the Iews to have  <a id="l13234"></a>feigned some things, as that  Amenophis to purge Egypt <a id="l13235"></a>from an impure generation  confined them to the city Abaris  that their captain <a id="l13236"></a>Osarsiphus was Moses,  &amp; that they rebelled &amp; called <a id="l13237"></a>in the Sheepherds to their assistance. If allowance be made for  this misapplication of the history the <a id="l13238"></a>record seems to amount to this, that  Asa (here called  Osarsi<a id="l13239"></a>phus)  was assisted in this war  by the Arabians , &amp; that   Amenophis  to secure Egypt from the conquerors made towards  the entrance of Egypt with an army of 300000 men &amp;  upon the flight of the Ethiopians returned to  <a id="l13243"></a>drive them out of Egypt, yet granted them the region above Thebais upon con<a id="l13244"></a>dition that  their king should be subordinate to him, &amp; then <a id="l13245"></a>he &amp; his son Rampses returned again with a greater force drove the Iews from  what  they had invaded beyond their borders  <a id="l13247"></a> <a id="l13248"></a>And these things explain the inscription upon the famous Obelisk of Ramesses  expressing <em class="underline">that <a id="l13249"></a>he had Saved Egypt by overcoming forreigners</em>,  that is <a id="l13250"></a>the Ethiopians &amp; perhaps the Iews &amp; Arabians. </p>
<p id="par1835">Yet by this war of the Ethiopians the dominion of Egypt  over the nations <a id="l13252"></a>fell.  ffor Asa  adorned the temple with gold &amp; silver &amp; had no more war for 20 years after  these things &amp; his <a id="l13253"></a>son Iehosaphat placed forces in all the fenced cities of Iudah &amp; had riches &amp; honour in <a id="l13254"></a>abundance And God established the kingdom in his hand &amp; the fear of the lord fell upon <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p237v"> &lt;237v&gt; </span> all the lands round about Iudea so that they made no war with Iehosaphat &amp; <a id="l13255"></a>the Philistims &amp; Arabians brought him great presents &amp; tribute silver &amp; he waxed <a id="l13256"></a>great exceedingly &amp; built in Iudah castells &amp; cities of stone &amp; had an army <a id="l13257"></a>of eleven hundred &amp; sixty thousand men besides those whom he put in the <a id="l13258"></a>fenced cities &amp; reigned over the  Edomites  by a deputy till the reign of his son <a id="l13259"></a> in which they revolted &amp; made themselves a king.  (2 Chron ch 17 &amp; ch. 21.8.) So <a id="l13260"></a>then the kingdom of Iudah from the time of their victory over the Ethiopians continued free &amp; waxed great exceedingly so that Egypt had no  longer dominion  over  them &amp; much less over the <a id="l13261"></a>remoter regions of Asia. Nor  do I read of any more war <a id="l13262"></a>the  Egyptians made in Syria or any other part of Asia before the reign of Nebuchadnezz <a id="l13263"></a>Well therefore doth Herodotus tell us that  Sesostris was the only <a id="l13264"></a><em class="underline">King of Egypt who had the dominion</em> (Herod. lib. 3)  For <a id="l13266"></a>his successor  Amenophes quickly lost it,  <a id="l13267"></a>Iudea serving Egypt only from the 5<sup>t</sup> year of Rehoboam to the 5<sup>t</sup> year <a id="l13268"></a>of Asa,  which was but 19 years.</p>

<p id="par1839">Diodorus tells us that when Osiris undertook – – – – Libya to Antæus. <a id="l13277"></a> Hercules  therefore was General or Chief Captain of the  forces of Egypt by land,  Mercury was the Secretary of State, &amp; Antæus &amp; Busiris were governors of Provinces.  Sometimes Hercules is taken for Osiris himself <a id="l13288"></a>as where they call him the companion of the Muses &amp; Musagetes extend his conquests to India &amp; to the straits mouth, celebrate his pillars &amp; <a id="l13289"></a>say he was slain by Typhon &amp; make him the same God with Mars the God of war, calling the star of Mars the <a id="l13290"></a>star of Hercules. For  Osiris was the Hercules or chief Captain of Egypt during the reign of <a id="l13291"></a>his father Ammon.</p>
<p id="par1840"> And as Hercules was the General so Neptune was the Admiral or commander of the ffleet of Egypt – – – – – – – of tall <a id="l13293"></a>ships with sails. Riding on horsback – – – –  Neptune to flight.</p>

<p id="par1843">In the old coyns of Possidonium &amp; some other towns of Italy Neptune <a id="l13302"></a>vibrates his Trident as a weapon of war &amp;  on those of Tarentum a town on <a id="l13303"></a>the south east corner of Italy Taras the son of Neptune (from whom the town had its name) rides on a <a id="l13304"></a>Dolphin &amp;  is sometimes armed with a Trident  &amp; in some <a id="l13305"></a> coynes of Syracuse in Sicily there are Tritons with a Trident <a id="l13306"></a>From  all which  I seem to gather that Neptune &amp; his sons invaded those <a id="l13307"></a>regions by Sea, &amp; that the Trident was  their common symbol  as commanders at sea <a id="l13308"></a>&amp; signified their force &amp; strength in war, that is their fleet consisting <a id="l13309"></a>of three Squadrons; a man with a Trident in his hand being in the old Egyptian <a id="l13310"></a>writing the Hieroglyphic of an Admiral with his ffleet. ffor the Egyptian writing in those days <a id="l13311"></a> was by Hieroglyphicks </p>

<p id="par1845">Neptune was the same man with  <a id="l13313"></a>Typhon the brother <a id="l13314"></a>– – – – – Neptune to flight.</p>
<p id="par1846">Neptune had also  some other names taken from his qualities but his proper name seems <a id="l13315"></a>to have been Atlas. For Atlas was an Egyptian  – – name to the <a id="l13316"></a>Ocean. ffor all the Ocean was anciently called Atlantic   from the mouth of the <a id="l13317"></a>Mediterranean to the mouth of the red sea &amp; beyond. And Homer <a id="l13318"></a>tells us of an Island in the Ocean which was called  Atlantis &amp; inhabited by <a id="l13319"></a>Calypso the daughter of Atlas, &amp; saith that Atlas Θαλάσσης <a id="l13320"></a>πάσης βένθεα οἰδεν <em class="underline">knows all the depths of the sea</em>. So that in <a id="l13321"></a>the opinion of Homer Atlas sailed with his children into the great <a id="l13322"></a>Ocean &amp;  after his death became a God of the Sea. Clemens Alex<a id="l13323"></a>andrinus saith that Atlas was the first that built a ship &amp; <a id="l13324"></a>sailed upon the seas; he means the first that built a long ship <a id="l13325"></a>with sails &amp; commanded a fleet at sea.  Some tell us that Phor<a id="l13326"></a>cys who reigned over Sardinia &amp; Corsica was overcome by Atlas <a id="l13327"></a>in a Sea fight &amp; drowned, &amp; others that Sardus the son of Neptune <a id="l13328"></a>carried a colony of Libyans into Sardinia. And no doubt that  colony was occasioned by the victory of Atlas. Homer <a id="l13330"></a>saith (Odys. 1. v. 70) that Neptune begat Polyphemus of Theosa the daughter <a id="l13331"></a>of Phorcys.</p>

<p id="par1847" class="i0">– – – At that time Artaxerxes Ochus carried away all the records <a id="l13332"></a>of the Egyptians, &amp; Manetho about 80 years after wrote his history <a id="l13333"></a>of the kings of Egypt, which has since been altered by Africanus. And <a id="l13334"></a>therefore I have relied more upon the account which Herodotus received <a id="l13335"></a>from the records themselves kept in the Temples of Egypt &amp; recited <a id="l13336"></a>to him by the Priests an hundred years before those records were <a id="l13337"></a>carried away by Ochus.</p>
<p id="par1848">Concerning the Dynasties of Manetho it may be observed  <a id="l13338"></a>that there is nothing in them which appears to be so old as Moses.</p>
<p id="par1849">The first &amp; second Dynasties – – – so that they were the same king.</p>
<p id="par1850">It may be further observed that these Dynasties are set together <a id="l13339"></a>in wrong order of time. The 15<sup>th</sup> 16<sup>th</sup> &amp; 17<sup>th</sup> Dynasties are of the shepherds <a id="l13340"></a>&amp;  so should have been set down  before the 12 13 &amp; 14<sup>th</sup> Dynastys which are of the kings of Diospolis  or Thebes &amp; these Dynasties should have been set down before the 3<sup>d</sup> 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; 6<sup>t</sup> Dynasties which are of the kings of Memphys. For Thebes  was in its prime in Homers days &amp; Memphis was not  till afterwards. </p>
<p id="par1851">It is further to be observed that the kings are often set down in a <a id="l13347"></a>wrong order &amp; their names corrupted &amp; repeated again &amp; again &amp; inter<a id="l13348"></a>mixed with the names of other great men &amp; weomen who were only the <a id="l13349"></a>relations of kings or their viceroys or  secretaries of state. So the  <a id="l13350"></a>11<sup>th</sup> &amp; 12 Dynasties  have these kings  in  continuall order Ammene<a id="l13351"></a>mes,  Gesongeses, Ammenemi filius, Ammanemes qui a suis Eunuchis <a id="l13352"></a>interfectus est, Sesostris qui Asiam  subegit omnem intra annos novem <a id="l13353"></a>una cum parte Europæ ad fines usque Thraciæ excitatis ubique monumentis <a id="l13354"></a>gentium a se devictarum, Lachares qui Labyrinthum in Arsenoithide Præ<a id="l13355"></a>fectura construxit in sepulturam suam, Ammeres, Ammenemes, Scemi<a id="l13356"></a>ophris ejus soror.  But Gesongeses &amp; Lachares are here corruptly written for Sesonchoses <a id="l13357"></a>&amp; Mœris, &amp; the  third &amp; fourth kings are a repetition of the first &amp; second <a id="l13358"></a>&amp; Scemiophris is to be omitted as being only the sister of a king &amp; Ammeres <a id="l13359"></a>&amp; Amenomes the brother of Semiophris  may be also omitted <a id="l13360"></a> as coming erroneusly after Mœris, &amp; looking like a <a id="l13361"></a>repetition of the first king Ammenemes. And if these corrections be made <a id="l13362"></a>the  11<sup>th</sup> &amp; 12 Dynasties will be reduced to these kings  Ammane<a id="l13363"></a>mes or Ammon who was slain by his Eunuchs, Sesonchosis or Sesostris who <a id="l13364"></a>conquered Asia &amp; Mœris who made the  <a id="l13365"></a>lake of Mœris &amp; the Labyrinth.</p>
<p id="par1852">Again the 17<sup>th</sup> &amp; 18<sup>th</sup> Dynasties as they are recited by Iosephus &amp; Africanus out <a id="l13366"></a>of Manetho have these kings</p>

<p id="par1887">The lower part of Egypt  being yearly overflowed by the Nile was scarce inhabited <a id="l13492"></a>before the invention of corn which made it usefull. And the king who by this invention first <a id="l13493"></a>peopled it &amp; reigned over it &amp; taught his people the use of Oxen, (perhaps the king of Heliopolis or the king of  Mesir where Memphis was afterwards built, or both) seems to have been worshipped <a id="l13494"></a>in the Ox by his subjects after his death. And this I take to be the state of the lower part <a id="l13495"></a>of Egypt till the  shepherds or Phenicians who fled from Ioshua conquered it <a id="l13496"></a>While they reigned  in Egypt, the upper part of Egypt called in scripture the land of Pathros was under <a id="l13497"></a>other kings, reigning perhaps at Coptos &amp; Thebes &amp; This, &amp; Elephantis &amp;  Heracleopolis &amp; the other greater cities  till they <a id="l13498"></a>conquered one another. ffor cities grew great in those days by being the seats of kings. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p242v"> &lt;242v&gt; </span> At length  Kings of Thebais &amp; other parts of Egypt <a id="l13499"></a>, came down upon the shepherds, &amp; after a lasting war drove them <a id="l13500"></a>out &amp; the Cophtites prevailing over the other kings placed their royal seat at Thebes &amp; gave their name to all Egypt. These conquerors worshipped not <a id="l13501"></a>the kings of the conquered nations, but the founders of their own new Empire <a id="l13502"></a>beginning the reign of their kings with the reign of their Gods &amp; Heroes. <a id="l13503"></a>Whence Ammon, Osiris, Isis, Orus, Bubaste &amp; their Secretary Thoth &amp; <a id="l13504"></a>  General Hercules &amp; Admiral Iapetus or Neptune were Kophtites &amp; <a id="l13505"></a> flourished after the expulsion of the Shepherds. ffor Osiris &amp; <a id="l13506"></a>Isis built Thebes  sumptuously &amp; reigned over all Egypt including Thebais, which cannot <a id="l13507"></a>be said of any kings of Egypt before the expulsion of the Shepherds. And Osiris <a id="l13508"></a>was also a very great conqueror of forreign nations, &amp; therefore not older then <a id="l13509"></a>Sesak.</p>
<p id="par1888">The kings of the Cophtites or Egyptians when they drave the shepherds out of <a id="l13510"></a>the lower Egypt were Mephramuthosis &amp; Amosis. And many of these <a id="l13511"></a>Shepherds returned from Egypt into Phœnicia  whereby the army of the Philistims in their wars <a id="l13512"></a>against Israel in the days of Ely  Samuel Saul &amp; David became exceeding numerous, &amp; others fled as far as <a id="l13513"></a>Asia minor &amp; Greece &amp; others went westward into Libya. And when Saul &amp; David conquered the Philistims <a id="l13514"></a>Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites &amp; Syrians, many of them fled by sea with <a id="l13515"></a>Cadmus &amp; other Captains to Asia minor, Greece &amp; Libya  &amp; carried along with them their letters &amp; arts &amp; musick &amp; poetry &amp; the digging excocting &amp; manuafacturing of metals &amp; making of edged tools &amp;  armour &amp; Charriots, &amp; taught the Greeks horsmanship &amp; to build houses &amp; towns &amp; ships &amp; temples &amp; to worship their dead Heroes. For the Gods of <a id="l13517"></a> Greece lived between the times of Cadmus &amp; the Argonautic <a id="l13518"></a>expedition; the Curetes &amp; Idæi Dactyli &amp; Telchines  &amp; Corybantes &amp; other Phœnician Priests <a id="l13519"></a>&amp; Princes,  &amp; the Egyptians whom Sesostris left in Thrace, introducing <a id="l13520"></a>this worship.  The Chronology of the Greeks makes these things <a id="l13521"></a>older  then the days of David.  But this chronology <a id="l13522"></a>was framed after the days of Alexander the Great by putting the <a id="l13523"></a>reigns of kings for generations &amp; recconing 30 or 40 years to a <a id="l13524"></a>generation: whereas kings reign one with another but about 18 or <a id="l13525"></a>20 years a piece. If the chronology  of the Greeks be corrected by the course of nature, the expedition of Sesostris which was one generation older then the Argonautic expedition, will fall in with that of Sesak.</p>
<p id="par1889">When the Phenicians fled with Cadmus &amp; his Sister Europa &amp; <a id="l13526"></a>carried letters &amp; arts &amp; sciences into Crete &amp; Greece, some of the Edomites <a id="l13527"></a> fled from David into Egypt &amp; others seem to have fled from him by the red  sea s far as the Persian gulf <a id="l13528"></a> &amp; to have carried their letters &amp; arts ~ to the places whether they fled. ffor Letters came into Egypt about that time  &amp; Berosus tells us that the Chaldeans between Tigris &amp; Euphrates were at first rude &amp; lived <a id="l13530"></a>like  brutes without laws, &amp; fed on roots &amp; the spontaneus fruits of the earth till one Oannes came thither  from the red <a id="l13531"></a>sea &amp; taught them  letters &amp; arts  &amp; how to live  together in cities &amp; make <a id="l13532"></a>laws &amp;  build  temples:  &amp; to sow &amp; reap &amp; that he had a double <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>shape<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> with a humane voice &amp; that his statue remained in Chaldea till his days having a head &amp; leggs of a man <a id="l13534"></a> &amp; also a head  &amp; taile of a fish. ffor so it seems they painted a seaman.</p>
<p id="par1890">After Amosis reigned Ammenemes or Ammon over Egypt. He subdued <a id="l13535"></a>Arabia &amp; all  Libya <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n229-ref">[229]</sup> calling it Ammonia &amp; laid the foundation of <a id="l13536"></a>the empire of Egypt. In his days the Egyptians invented long ships <a id="l13537"></a>with sails &amp; began to study Astronomy  for enabling them to sail by the stars without <a id="l13538"></a>sight of the  shore being perhaps assisted in these things by the Edomites who were skilled in navigation upon the  sea. He prepared a fleet of such ships upon the <a id="l13539"></a>red sea &amp; another upon the mediterranean on the coast of Libya <a id="l13540"></a>where there were convenient sea-ports &amp; timber for shipping. I think in Greece at Irasa the city of Antæus. He <a id="l13541"></a>reigned at Thebes from him called No-Ammon, the city of Ammon <a id="l13542"></a>&amp; upon his death had Temples erected to him with Oracles in them <a id="l13543"></a>at Thebes &amp; in Ammonia. And these are the oldest Oracles mentio<a id="l13544"></a>ned in history, the Greeks therein imitating the Egyptians.

<p id="par1899">Amenoph built Memphys from him called Menoph &amp; by contraction <a id="l13616"></a>Moph &amp; Noph, &amp; there founded the magnificent temple of Vulcan &amp; <a id="l13617"></a>his successors Rhampses Mœris Asychis &amp; Psammiticus built the western <a id="l13618"></a>northern eastern &amp; southern Porticos thereof.  The Egyptian Priests say that <a id="l13619"></a>Menes who reigned next after the Gods built Memphys &amp; the Temple <a id="l13620"></a>of Vulcan. And thence I seem to gather that Menes was Menoph or Amenoph &amp; not an older king. ffor <a id="l13621"></a>Psammiticus who built the last Portico of this Temple reigned  three hundred years after the victory of Asa <a id="l13622"></a>over Zerah &amp; it is not likely that this Temple could be above two or <a id="l13623"></a>thre hundred years in building.</p>
<p id="par1900">In the reign of Asychis or soon after the kingdom of Egypt brake <a id="l13624"></a>into three or four kingdoms.  Gnephactus &amp; his Son <a id="l13625"></a>Bocchoris  reigned successively at Memphys, Stephanates Nicepsos <a id="l13626"></a>&amp; Nechus successively at Sais, &amp; Anysis &amp; some others in other places <a id="l13627"></a>And in the time of these kingdoms, Ægypt was again subdued by the <a id="l13628"></a>Ethiopians under Sabacon who slew Bocharis &amp; Nechus &amp; made Anysis <a id="l13629"></a>fly.  About that time some Egyptians fleeing to Babylon carried thither <a id="l13630"></a>the year of Egypt &amp; the study of Astronomy &amp; Astrology which gave <a id="l13631"></a>occasion to the Æra of Nabonassar. Sabacon was succeeded by So or Sua <a id="l13632"></a>&amp; he by Tirhaka or Tearco &amp; he by Merres or Ammeres the <a id="l13633"></a>last Ethiopian king of Egypt. Then the Assyrians conquered Egypt <a id="l13634"></a>&amp; reigned over it about two years &amp; left it divided into 12 kingdoms <a id="l13635"></a>which stood about 15 years &amp; then were conquered by Psamiticus.</p>
<p id="par1901">The kingdom of Nimrod was  more famous for its antiquity <a id="l13636"></a>then for its greatness.  That of David was <a id="l13637"></a>considerable in those days. That of Egypt seated at Thebes was the first great Empire, <a id="l13638"></a>but of very short continuance,  the Princes of Sesack upon his death <a id="l13639"></a>falling into civil wars &amp; sharing his dominions amongst them. This was about the time of the Argonautic expedition.  And <a id="l13640"></a>the next Empire of moment was the Assyrian. Thebes the seat of <a id="l13641"></a>the  Egyptian Empire was famous <a id="l13642"></a>in Homers days. Memphys &amp;  her <a id="l13643"></a>wonders  &amp; Nineve &amp; the Assyrian empire are not mentioned by him &amp; <a id="l13644"></a>therefore rose up later.</p>

<p id="par1905">These Idæi Dactyli  according to the <a id="l13656"></a>marble were contemporary to Minos.  <a id="l13657"></a>Clemens Alex. tells us that they were reputed the first wise men &amp;  Phrygians &amp; Barbarians &amp; <a id="l13658"></a>found out the Ephesian letters, &amp;  Rhymes in Music, whence  the Musitian <a id="l13659"></a>Musitians called them Dactyli. He places them between the inundation of Deucalion &amp; the <a id="l13660"></a>expedition of Perseus.  They used to dance in armour shaking their heads &amp; <a id="l13661"></a>  striking brass upon brass  in harmony. <a id="l13662"></a>Solinus Polyistor c XI tells  us: Studium musicum inde cœptum cum Idæi <a id="l13663"></a>Dactyli modulos crepitu &amp; tinnitu æris deprehensos in versificum ordinem trans<a id="l13664"></a>tulissent. By all which they lived about the time that Bacchus  brought music &amp; poetry into Europe &amp; derived their wisdom &amp; skill from Egypt. About the same time  <a id="l13665"></a>people began to make armour in Lemnos under the management of an Artificer, And Prometheus  who was contemporary to Osiris &amp; reigned  over a <a id="l13666"></a>colony of Egyptians at mount Caucasus, taught the people there Astronomy &amp; <a id="l13667"></a>letters &amp; to build houses in the room of caves &amp; dens in which they lived before <a id="l13668"></a>&amp; to yoke oxen &amp;  draw chariots with horses &amp; to saile in ships  &amp; to dig  iron &amp; brass &amp; silver &amp; gold out of the earth, &amp; work them in the fire <a id="l13670"></a>as Æschylus describes. So also the people of Libya were without weapons of iron <a id="l13671"></a>till the Egyptians invaded them. ffor Pliny tells us:  Prælium Afri <a id="l13672"></a>primum fecere contra Ægypti fustibus quos vocant Phalangas And Higynus: Afri <a id="l13673"></a>et Ægyptij primum fustibus dimicaverunt, postea Belus Neptuni filius gladio <a id="l13674"></a>belligeratus est a quo bellum dictum.  Belus  therefore was that con<a id="l13675"></a>queror who with swords &amp; speares invaded the unarmed nations <a id="l13676"></a>&amp; by that means carried his conquests over the  world, And by <a id="l13677"></a>Iupiter Belus of the East  for whom Vulcan <a id="l13678"></a>&amp; his workmen made thunderbolts that is weapons of war, &amp; who is figured <a id="l13679"></a>with a thunderbold in one hand to represent him a warrior &amp; a scepter in the <a id="l13680"></a>other to represent him a king &amp; rides on an eagle to represent the sublimity of <a id="l13681"></a>his dominion. He was feigned to be the son of Neptune &amp; Libya to signify his valour <a id="l13682"></a>&amp; that he  came from Libya to conquer the east. And to this  Iupiter Belus <a id="l13683"></a>was the famous temple erected at Babylon .</p>

<p id="par1910">Manetho tells us that the Shepherds being expelled Egypt  by Misphragmu<a id="l13743"></a>thosis &amp; his son Amosis &amp; their associates went with their families &amp; possessions <a id="l13744"></a>to the number of 240000 out of Egypt through the wildernes into Syria &amp; <a id="l13745"></a>seating themselves in Iudea built there a city which might be sufficient <a id="l13746"></a>for their number &amp; called it Ierusalem. Here Manetho takes these shepherds <a id="l13747"></a>to be the Israelites who built Ierusalem, but he tells us that some took <a id="l13748"></a>them for Arabians. Africanus  speaking of  the first <a id="l13749"></a>six kings of the Shepherds tells us more truly that they were Phenicians. <a id="l13750"></a>Herodotus  [l. 2. c. 112] tells us that a region in Memphys  was inhabited by Tyrian Phenicians  And Manetho [apud Porphyrium περὶ ἀποχης &amp; Eusebium Præp l 4. c. 16. p. 155 that in Helio<a id="l13752"></a>polis they sacrificed three men dayly to Iuno till Amosis having taken that <a id="l13753"></a>city from them abolished those sacrifices by substituting waxen images of <a id="l13754"></a>men. By their religion you may know that  the people <a id="l13755"></a>expelled by Amosis were Phenicians. Diodorus in his 40<sup>th</sup> book [apud Photium <a id="l13756"></a>in Bibl.] saith that in Egypt there were formerly multitudes of Strangers <a id="l13757"></a>of several nations who used forreign rites &amp; ceremonies in worshipping the <a id="l13758"></a>Gods, for which they were expelled Egypt &amp; under Danaus Cadmus &amp; other <a id="l13759"></a>skilfull commanders after great hardships came into Greece &amp; other <a id="l13760"></a>places but the greatest part of them came into Iudea not far from <a id="l13761"></a>Egypt a country then uninhabited &amp; desert, being conducted thither by one <a id="l13762"></a>Moses a wise &amp; valiant man who after he had possessed himself of the <a id="l13763"></a>country, among other cities built Ierusalem. In relating these things <a id="l13764"></a>the Egyptians &amp; Greeks have confounded the history of the departure of <a id="l13765"></a>Israel out of Egypt under the conduct of Moses with that of the expul<a id="l13766"></a>sion of the Phenicians by Amosis &amp; that of the expulsion of the Iews by <a id="l13767"></a>Amenophis in the reign of Asa,  &amp; by doing so have sometimes made <a id="l13768"></a>Moses contemporary to Amosis &amp; sometimes taken Osarsiphus for Moses <a id="l13769"></a>whereas Amosis was contemporary to Samuel &amp; Osarsiphus to Asa. If their <a id="l13770"></a>narrations be freed from this mistake they will amount to this, that a little <a id="l13771"></a>before the building of Ierusalem by David the shepherds were expelled <a id="l13772"></a>Egypt by Misphramuthosis &amp; Amosis &amp; the greatest part of them came into Phœicia &amp; by <a id="l13773"></a>consequence assisted the Philistims &amp; Edomites against  Eli Samuel &amp; David <a id="l13774"></a>&amp; some of them under the conduct of Lelex, Cecrops, Inachus, Phoroneus, Phorbas <a id="l13775"></a>Pelasgus,  Hellen, Æolus the father of Æthlius Ceres Cadmus, Erechtheus, Phineus Membliarius Peteos, Asterius,  Danaus &amp; civilized the Greeks <a id="l13776"></a>teaching them to leave of their way of living in caves &amp; woods like wild beasts <a id="l13777"></a>&amp; to assemble &amp; live together in towns &amp; cities &amp; to exercise manual arts &amp; <a id="l13778"></a>plow &amp; sow &amp; use letters &amp; to worship their dead kings &amp; Heroes &amp; erect Temples Statues &amp; Oracles to them. And these things were not so ancient by two or <a id="l13779"></a>three hundred years as they have been represented by the Greek Chronologers, who  lived about 40 years <a id="l13780"></a>after the reign of Alexander the great &amp; formed the Chronology of the <a id="l13781"></a>Greeks by the years of the Olympiads. </p>

In the 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad the Quinquertium was <a id="l13801"></a>restored &amp; the Disk was one of the games of the Quinquertium &amp; the name <a id="l13802"></a>Lycurgus was upon the Disk &amp; therefore he &amp; his young pupil Charilaus lived <a id="l13803"></a>at that time, but  the Chronologers make them almost 200 years older. <a id="l13804"></a>Lycurgus (according to Athenæus l 14 p. 625) was  contemporary to  Ter<a id="l13805"></a>pander  the Musitian &amp; that Terpander was the first man who got <a id="l13806"></a>the victory in the Carnea in a solemnity of music instituted in those festi<a id="l13807"></a>vals in the 26<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. Iphitus who restored the Olympic games was <a id="l13808"></a>descended from Oxylus the son of Hæmon the son of Thoas the son of <a id="l13809"></a>Andræmon. Hercules &amp; Andæmon married two sisters, Thoas warred at <a id="l13810"></a>Troy. Oxylus returned into Peloponnesus with the Heraclides. Iphitus is by <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p244v"> &lt;244v&gt; </span> some recconed the son of Hæmon, by  others the son of Praxonidas <a id="l13811"></a>the son of Hæmon. But Hæmon being the father of  Oxylus I <a id="l13812"></a>would reccon Iphitus the son of Praxonidas the son of Oxylus the <a id="l13813"></a>son of Hæmon. But the Chronologers  place the return of the Hera<a id="l13814"></a>clides into Peloponnesus 326 years before the restauration of the Olympiads <a id="l13815"></a>by Iphitus.  Hercules the Argonaut was one generation younger then Sesostris the <a id="l13817"></a>brother of Danaus &amp; the Hereclides returned into Peloponnesus  in the fourth generation  from Hercules, &amp; two generations <a id="l13819"></a>more to  Iphitus, makes seven generations from Sesostris to <a id="l13820"></a>Iphitus which  recconing about 28 or 30 years to a generation <a id="l13821"></a>amounts to about 200 years. And so many yeres there <a id="l13822"></a>were between the expedition of Sesak &amp; the first Olympiad. <a id="l13823"></a>And by  all these arguments Sesostris was contemporary <a id="l13824"></a>to Sesak.</p>
<p id="par1912">The  ancient Greeks in feigning that Io the  daughter <a id="l13825"></a>of  Inachus or as others say of Phoroneus went into Egypt &amp; became the Egyptian Isis &amp; that <a id="l13826"></a>Apis the son of Phoroneus after he had reigned in Greece became the Egyptian Epaphus or Osiris shews that <a id="l13827"></a>Osiris &amp; Isis reigned in Egypt (according to the opinion of the ancient <a id="l13828"></a>Greeks who made these fables) about two or three generations later <a id="l13829"></a>then Inachus reigned in Greece &amp; by consequence  that they were contemporary <a id="l13831"></a>to Sesostris &amp; his Queen or not above one generation earlier <a id="l13832"></a>&amp; by the unanimous consent of all antiquity Osiris was the great <a id="l13833"></a>Bacchus. The Egyptians (as Diodorus C. 1. p. 14 relates) make Osiris contemporary to  Triptolemus &amp; Lycurgus king of Thrace. And these two men lived but one or two generations before the Argonautic expedition, Lycurgus being contemporary to Tharops the grandfather of Orpheus. Sesostris Osiris &amp; Bacchus agree in all things &amp; therefore were one &amp; the same king. All three were <a id="l13834"></a>kings of Egypt &amp; great conquerors &amp; potent at sea &amp; lived in the same age. All three  carried on their conquests <a id="l13835"></a>through Persia as far as India. All three set up pillars where they <a id="l13836"></a>conquered. All three had an army of weomen as well as an army of men. All three came over the Hellespont  into Thrace &amp; were there in danger of losing their army. All three conquered <a id="l13837"></a>Thrace &amp; there put a stop to their conquests &amp; returned back from thence into Egypt. And their history agrees <a id="l13838"></a>also with so much  of the history of Sesak as is extant. He came out of <a id="l13839"></a>Egypt with a very great army &amp; God gave him the kingdoms of the <a id="l13840"></a>earth 2 Chron 12.8. And in those times till  Asa fortified Iudea &amp; overcame Zerah <a id="l13841"></a>, there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that <a id="l13842"></a>came in but great vexations wer upon all the inhabitants of the <a id="l13843"></a>countreys &amp; nation was destroyed of nation &amp; city of city for God <a id="l13844"></a>did vex them with all adversity 2 Chron 15.5, 6 Herodotus adds that where nations submitted without opposition Sesostris set up pillars with the genitals of a woman &amp; that there were such pillars in Iudea &amp; the scriptures tell us that Iudea submitted to Sesak without opposition. Well therefore did <a id="l13845"></a>Iosephus  say that Herodotus had ascribed to Sesostris the actions <a id="l13846"></a>of Sesak.  ffor there is no other king of Egypt besides <a id="l13848"></a>Sesak to which the great actions of Sesostris  Osiris &amp; Bacchus can <a id="l13849"></a>agree.</p>

<h2 id="hd34" class="cent">The Introduction</h2>
<p id="par1916">① The first recconing of time  among the Greeks was by generations &amp; reigns of kings,  &amp; this recconing was used by the Greeks <a id="l13879"></a>till the times of the Persian  Empire.   In the latter times of that Empire, &amp; Chiefly after the death of Alexander the great  the Greeks  <a id="l13882"></a>turned genealogies into numbers of years recconing the reigns of kings  one <a id="l13883"></a>with another for genealogies &amp;  three genealogies to about an hundred years <a id="l13884"></a>&amp; by such recconings they adjusted their ancient times to the Olympic years.  <a id="l13885"></a>  &amp; made the times before the Persian Empire <a id="l13886"></a>much too ancient. For kings reign one with another but about 18 or <a id="l13887"></a>20 years apiece, seldome above 24 years a piece in any kingdom or under 14 whereas in the chronology of the Greeks preceding the Persian Monarchy they reign <a id="l13888"></a>one with another about 34 years a piece. Let the times between the return of the <a id="l13889"></a>Heraclides into Peloponnesus &amp; the invasion of Greece by Darius Hystaspis <a id="l13890"></a>(whereby the Chronology of the Greeks  began to be connected with that of the  <a id="l13891"></a>Persians)  be shortened in the proportion of about 19 to 34: &amp; <a id="l13892"></a>the return of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus will be about the tenth year of Amaziah <a id="l13893"></a>king of Iudah.  ⑤ Hercules the Argonaut  flourished four generations earlier, which <a id="l13894"></a>recconing about 26 or 28 years to a generation by the eldest sons of a <a id="l13895"></a>family amount to about 110 years, &amp;  by this recconing the Argonautick expedition <a id="l13896"></a>was  in the middle of the reign of Asa about 40 years after the death of Solomon, &amp; the expedition of Sesostris  in the <a id="l13897"></a>middle of the reign of Rehoboam. ffor  the expedition of Sesostris was one gene<a id="l13898"></a>ration earlier then the Argonautic expedition, the ship Argo being the first long ship of the Greeks &amp; built in <a id="l13899"></a>imitation of the  ship in which Danaus  fled with his  daughters <a id="l13900"></a> from his brother  Ægyptus or Sesostris into Greece in the <a id="l13901"></a>end of that expedition, &amp; Nauplius the son of  Amymone one of the daughters of Danaus being an Argo<a id="l13902"></a>naut. Sesostris was contemporary to  Sesak  &amp; both were kings of Egypt &amp; therefore they were the same king  for their names &amp; actions agree, Sesostris being sometimes called Sethosis, Sesaosis Sesonchis &amp; Sesonchosis) <a id="l13904"></a>By this recconing also the Trojan war (which was one generation later then the Argonautic expedition) <a id="l13905"></a>fell in with the reign of the father of Dido as Virgil (not from the chronology of the Greeks but rather from that of the Carthaginians) relates, &amp; Homer &amp; Hesiod were <a id="l13906"></a>not above 400 years older then Herodotus, as Herodotus relates;// &amp; <span class="ns">☉</span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 246r &gt; </span> 
<span class="ns">☉</span> And these  recconings are confirmed by  Astronomy. For in the primitive Constellations, the histories of things done in Greece <a id="l13907"></a>are  described till the times of the Argonautic expedition &amp; that expedition <a id="l13908"></a>is delineated in the signes of Aries, Taurus, Gemini,  Argo. Hydra, Crater, <a id="l13909"></a>Corvus  &amp; Chiron, &amp; nothing  relating to the Trojan <a id="l13910"></a>war or to the war of the seven Captains  nothing later then the <a id="l13911"></a>Argonautic expedition is there represented. Which convinces me that the  <a id="l13912"></a>celestial globe was formed in the time of that expedition &amp; most probably <a id="l13913"></a>by Chiron &amp; Musæus  or one of them &amp; that for the use of the Argonauts.  For Laertius tells us <a id="l13914"></a>that Musæus made the first sphære &amp; he was the Master of Orpheus &amp; one of the Argonauts. And an ancient author cited by Clemens Alexandrinus saith that Chiron the master of Iason delineated σχηματα Ὀλύμπου the constellations. Now the Equinoctial &amp; solstial points <a id="l13915"></a>in the  oldest sphere of the ancients were placed in the middle of the signes or constellations of <a id="l13916"></a>Aries,  Cancer, Chelæ &amp; Capricorn that the Lunisolar year might begin when the sun was in the first signe. Afterwards those  points were found in the <a id="l13917"></a>twelft degree of those  constellations &amp; then in the eighth  &amp; at last in the <a id="l13918"></a>beginning of those  constellations. The motion of the Equinoxes  &amp; solstices are now well <a id="l13919"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>known &amp;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>  being counted <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>back<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>wards from the present times will  place those points upon the middle of <a id="l13920"></a>those constellations in the reign of Asa where we placed <a id="l13921"></a>the Argonautic expedition. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p246v-a"> &lt;246v&gt; </span> When Meton found out the Cycle of 19 years in order to publish it he &amp; Euctemon <a id="l13922"></a>observed the solstice in the year of Nabonassar 316 &amp; placed it in the eighth degree <a id="l13923"></a>of the constellation of Cancer. And recconing that the Equinox goes backward a degree in 72 years &amp; <a id="l13924"></a> seven degrees in 504 years, the summer solstice will fall upon the middle of <a id="l13925"></a>Cancer in the 45<sup>th</sup> year after the death of Solomon. And least you should <a id="l13926"></a>think that the solstices were not observed so long ago, the Greeks in those days <a id="l13927"></a>had many  Astronomers, Endymion, Aristæus, Chiron, Linus, Musæus, Atreus, <a id="l13928"></a>Ancæus, Orpheus, Palamedes. Aristæus  who married Autonoe the daughter of Cadmus brought Astro<a id="l13929"></a>nomy from Libya where he was educated: &amp; Iustin saith that he found or observed <a id="l13930"></a>the rising of the stars in the solstice.

<p id="par1930">Memnon reigned long,  recovered the dominion of Sesostris at Susa <a id="l13990"></a> raised some magnificent structures in Ægypt, <a id="l13991"></a>&amp; was by Homer  Pindar &amp; the ancient Greeks reputed  one generation later then Tithonus the  elder brother of Priam,  &amp; contemporary to the Trojan war. He was <a id="l13994"></a>succeeded by his son Ramesses Rhampsis or Rhampsinitus who built the western <a id="l13995"></a>portico of the  very magnificent Temple of Vulcan at Memphis. And Mœris built <a id="l13996"></a>the  northern Portico Asychis the eastern Portico &amp; Psammiticus the <a id="l13997"></a>southern Portico of the same Temple.  Whence I gather that Menes who <a id="l13998"></a>built the body of that Temple reigned after the expulsion of the Shepherds <a id="l13999"></a>ffor  Psammiticus reigned 300 years after Sesak, &amp; it <a id="l14000"></a>is not likely that a Temple could be above three or four hundred years in <a id="l14001"></a>building or that so magnificent a structure for architecture &amp; bigness could be <a id="l14002"></a>  founded before Ammon &amp; Sesack erected the monarchy of Egypt &amp; Amosis united the upper &amp; lower Ægypt under one king. Thebes was the <a id="l14003"></a>imperial seat of Ammon &amp; Sesak &amp; from Ammon had its name of Ammon-no or <a id="l14004"></a>No-ammon,  &amp; was famous in Homers days: but Memphis which <a id="l14005"></a>afterwards became the imperial seat of the kings of Egypt is not once mentioned <a id="l14006"></a>by Homer. That city  with its miracles rose up afterards  the kings of Egypt adorning it when it became their imperial seat. Mœris <a id="l14008"></a>made the Lake of Mœris with two great Pyramids in it  &amp; a <a id="l14009"></a>Labyrinth near it. His successors Suphis Cephrene  Mycerinus &amp; Nitocris followed his <a id="l14010"></a>example in building Pyramids. After them reigned Asychis who built a large brick Pyramid &amp; the eastern <a id="l14011"></a>Portico of the Temple of Vulcan &amp; then Egypt became divided into three or more <a id="l14012"></a>kingdoms. Gnephactus &amp; his son Bocchorus reigned at Memphis. Stephanates, Ni<a id="l14013"></a>cepsos &amp; Nechus reigned successively at Sais, &amp; others reigned at Tanis or Zoan</p>
<p id="par1931">In the days of Boccharis &amp; Nechus Egypt was again invaded &amp; <a id="l14014"></a>subdued by the Ethiopians under Sabacon &amp; continued in the hands of his <a id="l14015"></a>successors Sevechus,  So,  Tirhaka &amp;  Merres or Ameres till it was conquered by the Assyrians.</p>
<p id="par1932">It was the custome of the ancient heathens to consecrate &amp; worship <a id="l14016"></a>their dead kings as Gods &amp; sacrifice to them upon their tombs &amp; gravestones as <a id="l14017"></a>altars &amp; in their Sepulchers as Temples. The Latines worshipped their ancient <a id="l14018"></a>kings Saturn Ianus &amp; Quirinus &amp; continued to consecrate their dead Emperors till <a id="l14019"></a>the fall of the heathen Empire. The  Phenican colonies who came with Cadmus &amp; <a id="l14020"></a>Europa consecrated their dead Heroes  Ino the daughter of Cadmus  the son of his sister Iupiter Creticus,  Bacchus, Ladæmon  &amp; Hercules his grandchildren, &amp; other Heros to the fourth generation.

<p id="par1933">Oracles began in Ægypt in the days of Amon &amp; Sesostris, &amp; came thence into <a id="l14040"></a>Greece.  The first Oracle was at Thebes. Thence  went two Priestesses after the death of Ammon the one into  Libya where she set up the Oracle of Iupiter Ammon, &amp; the other into <a id="l14041"></a>Greece where she set up the Oracle of Iupiter Dodonæus at Dodonia. Herodotus tells us that this was the oldest Oracle in Greece &amp; resembled the Oracles of Ægypt  Sesostris after his wars dividing <a id="l14042"></a>Ægypt into  36 Nomes &amp; building Temples in the capital cities, set up Oracles <a id="l14043"></a>in most of them if not in all of them,  &amp; all the Temples and  their Councils of Senators or Princes of the Nome who  met at set times of the year to order <a id="l14045"></a>publick affairs, the people at the same time coming together to sacrifice &amp; feast &amp; <a id="l14046"></a>buy &amp; sell &amp; consult the Oracle &amp; the Oracle was inspired no doubt by the Priests &amp; they by the councillors or by the King of Egypt.  And in like manner the Greeks  <a id="l14047"></a> set up Oracles in  the Temple of Apollo at Delphos ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 247v &gt; </span> [✝ And in like manner the Greeks set up Oracles in the temple of Apollo at Delphos &amp; in that of Ceres at Patræ neare Thermopylæ in which two places the Amphictyonic <a id="l14048"></a>Council instituted by Acrisius met half yearely with the people to sacrifice &amp; feast &amp; buy &amp; sell <a id="l14049"></a>after the manner of  the Councils of Egypt.

<p id="par1940">3 Iphitus &amp; his successors præsided both in the temple of Iupiter Olympus &amp; <a id="l14231"></a>in the Olympic games till the  26<sup>th</sup>  Olympiad &amp; so long the victors <a id="l14232"></a>were rewarded with a Tripus. Then the Pisæns getting above the Eleans began <a id="l14233"></a>to preside &amp; rewarded the victors with a crown &amp; instituted the Carnea to <a id="l14234"></a>Apollo &amp; continued to preside till Phidon interrupted them which was in the 48<sup>th</sup> <a id="l14235"></a>Olympiad. ffor in that Olympiad the Eleans entred the country of the Pisæans <a id="l14236"></a>with an army but were  perswaded to return home quietly. Then the <a id="l14237"></a>Pisæans confederated with several other Greek nations (viz Phidon &amp; those <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>under<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l14238"></a>him) &amp; made war upon the Eleans &amp; in the end were beaten.  During these wars <a id="l14239"></a>I conceive it was that Phidon præsided suppose in the 48<sup>th</sup> or 49<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. ffor in the <a id="l14240"></a>50<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, for putting an end to the contentions between the kings about <a id="l14241"></a>presiding two men were chosen by lot out of the city of Elis to preside &amp; their <a id="l14242"></a>number in the 65 Olympiad was increased to 9, &amp; afterwards to ten &amp; these <a id="l14243"></a>judges were called Hellenodicæ, Iudges for or in the name of Greece. Strabo <a id="l14244"></a>tells us that Phidon was the tenth from Temenus, not the tenth king  <a id="l14245"></a>(for between Cisus &amp; Phidon they reigned not) but the tenth by generation from <a id="l14246"></a>father to son including Temenus &amp; the nine intervals taking up the 240 <a id="l14247"></a>years from Temenus to Phidon there were about 80 years to three gene<a id="l14248"></a>rations which is a moderate recconing.</p>
<p id="par1941">4 Herodotus tells us that Perdiccas founded the kingdom of Macedon &amp; that <a id="l14249"></a>the seven first kings were Perdiccas Argeus Philippus Aeropus Alcetas <a id="l14250"></a>Amyntas Alexander the last of which was contemporary to Xerxes. Let <a id="l14251"></a>their reigns be recconed at about 18 or 20 years apiece &amp; counted back<a id="l14252"></a>ward from the death of Xerxes &amp; they will place the founding of <a id="l14253"></a>that kingdom  in the days of Phidon the brother of Caranus <a id="l14254"></a>suppose in the 48<sup>th</sup> or 49<sup>th</sup> Olympiad. When the Eleans &amp; Spartans together conquered Phidon then Phidon &amp; <a id="l14255"></a>his brother Caranus &amp; kinsman Perdiccas being all of the posterity of Temenus fled <a id="l14256"></a>from Argos into Macedonia &amp; there seated themselves. ffor Thucydides tells <a id="l14257"></a>us that the progenitors of Alexander were of the posterity of Temenus &amp; <a id="l14258"></a>came from Argos &amp; obteined the sea coasts of Macedonia &amp; reigned there <a id="l14259"></a>expelling the inhabitants of Pieria by war, &amp; makes Archelaus the son of <a id="l14260"></a>Perdiccas the son of Alexander the ninth king of Macedon. And this seems to be the original <a id="l14261"></a>of the kingdom of Macedon. </p>
<p id="par1942">5. Hercules the Argonaut flourished one generation before the destruction of Troy &amp; four generations before the return <a id="l14262"></a>of the Heraclides into Peloponnesus: which recconing about 26 or 28 years to <a id="l14263"></a>a generation by the eldest sons of a family, place the  taking of Troy about 80 years &amp; the Argonautic expedition about 110 <a id="l14265"></a>years before the return of the Heraclides.

<p id="par1943">7 The Romans by conquering Carthage  grew acquainted with <a id="l14267"></a>the  records of the Carthaginians.

Virgil followed not the Chronology of the modern Greeks nor <a id="l14280"></a>perhaps was acquainted with it. If he followed that of the  Cartha<a id="l14281"></a>ginians, then Teucer after the destruction of Troy (the marble saith seven years <a id="l14282"></a>after)  sailed to Cyprus in the reign of  Belus  (otherwise called Methres &amp; <a id="l14283"></a>Matgenus) the father of Pygmaleon &amp; Dido &amp; there built the city Salamis. Iosephus calls Belus Matgenus &amp; tells us out <a id="l14284"></a>of the Tyrian Annals that he reigned nine years  &amp; that Carthage was built in the <a id="l14285"></a>seventh year of his son &amp; successor Pigmaleon, that is 90 years after the death of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p248v-b"> &lt;248v&gt; </span> Solomon.

When <a id="l14322"></a>Theseus was  50 years old he stole  Helena <a id="l14323"></a>she being seven or as some say ten years old &amp; when she was the <a id="l14324"></a>wife of Menelaus &amp; about 20 or 25 years old Paris stole her <a id="l14325"></a>&amp; Troy was destroyed 20 years after acording to Homer.  From <a id="l14326"></a>the time therefore that Bacchus  took Ariadne from Theseus to the <a id="l14327"></a>destruction of Troy were about 60 or 65 years. He took her from Theseus by the help of his fleet for Glaucus the son of Neptune lay with her.</p>

Polydorus the son of Cadmus was the <a id="l14335"></a>father of Labdacus the father of Laius the father of Ædipus the <a id="l14336"></a>father of Eteocles &amp; Polynices who in their youth slew one <a id="l14337"></a>another at the war of the seven captains against Thebes about ten <a id="l14338"></a>years after the argonautic expedition.   From the time therefore <a id="l14339"></a>that Cadmus came into Europe with his young son Polydorus, to the  <a id="l14340"></a>war of the seven Captains there were  four generations by the <a id="l14341"></a>eldest sons of the family &amp; so many years more as  Polydorus was younger <a id="l14342"></a>then Eteocles &amp; Polynice:  that is about 110 or 120 years, recconing about <a id="l14343"></a>27 years to a generation.

The war between the <a id="l14366"></a>Athenians &amp; Eleusinians in which Erechtheus was slain was presently after her <a id="l14367"></a>death.</p>
<p id="par1953">14.

<p id="par1954">15 That the kings of Argos may be no older  it is to be noted that the race of the kings of this city between Phoroneus &amp; Acrisius <a id="l14376"></a>(namely Apis Argus Pirasus Phorbas Triopas Iasus Crotonus Sthenelus Danaus Lynceus Abas) is very corrupt.  I suspect it was taken from the brazen table which Acusilaus <a id="l14377"></a>pretended to dig up in his fathers house.  ffor he  made Phoroneus the oldest king <a id="l14378"></a>of Greece &amp; therefore  feignd such an account  of the race of  his successor <a id="l14379"></a> as made him the oldest.   For some of the kings between Phoroneus <a id="l14380"></a>&amp; Acrisius as Sthenelus Danaus &amp; Lynceus were later then Perseus the grandson <a id="l14381"></a>of Acrisius, &amp; others as Pirasus Phorbas &amp; Triopas were contemporary to Ina<a id="l14382"></a>chus &amp; Phoroneus.  For Polycaon the youngest son of Lelex married Messene <a id="l14383"></a>the daughter of Triopas the son of Phorbas: &amp; therefore Phorbas &amp; his brother <a id="l14384"></a>Pirasus were as old as Lelex who was older then Inachus.  Clemnes makes Phorbas <a id="l14385"></a>as old as  Actæus the predecessor of Cecrops <a id="l14386"></a>&amp; Triopas as old as Cecrops.   Iasus was the father of that Io <a id="l14387"></a>who was carried into Egypt &amp; therefore is written corruptly for Inachus <a id="l14388"></a> Huginus (Fab 145) writes it not Iasus but Inachus.  One Inachus &amp; one <a id="l14389"></a>Io chronologers have made two, &amp; instead of the  second Inachus written <a id="l14390"></a>Iasus.  Apis is the Epaphus or Epopus mentioned above.   His son &amp; successor Argus  gave his name <a id="l14392"></a>to the city.  Whence I reccon the first four kings to be Inachus, Phoroneus, <a id="l14393"></a>Apis &amp; Argus.  The brothers Acrisus &amp; Prætus were  as old as Argus &amp; reigned in <a id="l14394"></a> two several places Acrisius with his successors Perseus,  Sthenelus, Danaus, <a id="l14395"></a>Lynceus Abas in one place &amp; Prætus Megapenthes Anaxagoras &amp;c in another place <a id="l14396"></a> &amp; Perseus changed kingdoms with <a id="l14397"></a>Megapenthes.   Inachus had several sons who reigned in several <a id="l14398"></a>parts of Peloponnesus &amp; there built towns as Phoroneus who built Phoropi<a id="l14399"></a>cum afterwards called Argos, Ægyaleus who built Ægyalea afterwards called <a id="l14400"></a>Sicyon, &amp; Phegeus who built Phegea afterwards called Psophis.  Phoroneus had <a id="l14401"></a>also several children as Apis Car &amp; Spartus who reigned in several places.  And <a id="l14402"></a>this division &amp; subdivision has made a great confusion in the history of the <a id="l14403"></a>kingdoms of Peloponnesus.  But <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n237-ref">[237]</sup> Pausanias tells us that in the reign of Car the <a id="l14404"></a>son of Phoroneus temples were first erected to Ceres in Megara &amp; that Car <a id="l14405"></a>erected a Temple to her there: &amp; therefore Car was contemporary <a id="l14406"></a>to Erectheus Celeus &amp; Cadmus &amp; Inachus but two gene<a id="l14407"></a>rations older, &amp; the rapture of his <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017r"> &lt;17r&gt; </span> daughter Io but one generation older then that of Europa.</p>
<p id="par1955">16. Herodotus tells us that the Phenicians were the authors of dissentions <a id="l14408"></a>who coming from the red sea to the Mediterranean ………. was committed soon after in <a id="l14409"></a>revenge of the rapture of Io.</p>
<p id="par1956">17 The red sea being shallow &amp; calm &amp; full of islands navigation <a id="l14410"></a>began there in small round vessels sufficient to pass from island to island.  When by <a id="l14411"></a> the shepherds of Egypt &amp;  soon after by the army of David  the Edomites were driven from the red sea they fled to the <a id="l14412"></a>coasts of the Mediterrannean then under the  communion of the Canaanites &amp; built  Azoth &amp; <a id="l14413"></a>began to coast the mediterranean in such vessels as they had used in the red <a id="l14414"></a>sea &amp;  seized Sidon &amp; went from thence as far as Greece  with Colonies &amp; merchandice &amp; <a id="l14415"></a>stole Io, &amp; sending colonies to several places upon the mediterranean built new <a id="l14416"></a>towns &amp; named some of them Erythra from their old King Erythra  the author of navigation &amp;  from <a id="l14417"></a> Erythrean sea so named after him.  And at length the Egyptians  found out long ships <a id="l14418"></a>with sails  in imitation of which the Greeks built the ship Argos &amp; presently after the Trojan war the Tyrheans sailed as far as Gades &amp;there bu. And in the <a id="l14419"></a>mean time the trafic of the  red sea came into the hands of David &amp; his son <a id="l14420"></a>Solomon.  So Stephanus in Azot tells us that <em class="underline">a fugitive from the  Ery<a id="l14421"></a>thræan sea built Azot or Ashdod</em> &amp; Pliny: <em class="underline">Nave primus, in Græciam ex Ægypto <a id="l14422"></a>Dinaus advenit vente ratibus navigabatur inventis in mare rubro  <a id="l14423"></a>inter insulas a rege Erythra</em>. Erytha is the king of Edom usually supposed to <a id="l14424"></a>be Esau.  ffor Esau Edom &amp; Erythra are words of the same signification <a id="l14425"></a>&amp; signify red.  So Pliny Solinus &amp; Isidorus tell us that Erythia at Gades had its <a id="l14426"></a>name from the Tyreans who came from the red sea – Erythia dicta est quoniam <a id="l14427"></a>Tyrij aborigines eorum orti a rubro mari ferebantur.  Plin. l. 4 c. 22. In capite <a id="l14428"></a>Bœticæ insula a continenti setpingentis memoratur quam Tyrij a mari rubro <a id="l14429"></a>profecti Erythiam Pœni sua lingua Gadir id est septum vocarunt.  Solin cap. 26. <a id="l14430"></a>Quare Tyrij a rubro mari profecti occupantes in lingua sua Gades id est septum <a id="l14431"></a>nominaverunt. Isidorus. And so Dionysius Afer tells us that the Phœnicians <a id="l14432"></a>sprang originally from those men who were native Erythræans &amp; invented <a id="l14433"></a>shipping &amp; merchandice by sea &amp; Astronomy &amp; that they inhabited Ioppa,  Gaza <a id="l14434"></a>Elais Tyre, Berytus Byblus Sidon Tripolis.  And his old interpreter Priscian:</p>
<div class="lg"><p class="l20">– littora juxta</p>
<p class="l">Phœnices vivunt veteri cognomine dicti</p>
<p class="l">Quos misit quondam mare rubrum</p></div>
<p id="par1957" class="i0">And the Phenicians themselves &amp; the Persians related to Herodotus that the Phenician <a id="l14435"></a>merchants traded first upon the red sea &amp; went from thence to the Mediterranean <a id="l14436"></a>just before the rapture of Io (Herod l. 1. c. 1 &amp; l 7. c 89.) And Herodotus tells us <a id="l14437"></a>also that the Gephureans were Phœnicians who came with Cadmus into Bœotia <a id="l14438"></a>&amp; affirmed of themselves that they were originally from Erethria.  And Stepha<a id="l14439"></a>nus that Erythra was the name of a city in Bœotia of another in Ionia, of another in Libya, of <a id="l14440"></a>another in Cyprus.  It was also the name of a city  in Ætolia &amp; of another in <a id="l14441"></a>Paphlagonia &amp; of another in Asia near Chius &amp; of a Promontory in Crete &amp; of <a id="l14442"></a>another in Libya.  And no doubt these names were imposed by the Erythræans in <a id="l14443"></a>memory of the country  &amp; Sea from whence they came.</p>
<p id="par1958">18. And that the Mediterranean began at this time to be navigated may <a id="l14444"></a>be gathered from the  first peopling of the Islands.  ffor Diodorus tells us that <a id="l14445"></a>the seven Islands called Æolides between Italy &amp; Sicily were desert &amp; unin<a id="l14446"></a>habited till Lipanus &amp; Æolus about the time of the Trojan war went <a id="l14447"></a>thither &amp; peopled them: that Malta &amp; Gaulus or Gaudus on the south side <a id="l14448"></a>of Sicily were first peopled by Phenicians &amp; so was Madera without the <a id="l14449"></a>straits: that the Cyclade Islands were at first desolate &amp; uninhabited <a id="l14450"></a>but Minos the Son of Europa king of Crete having a powerful <a id="l14451"></a>fleet sent many colonies out of Crete &amp; peopled many of those islands <a id="l14452"></a>&amp; particularly Carpathus.  Sime lay wast &amp; desolate till Treops <a id="l14453"></a>came thither with a colony under Cthonius.  Strongylæ or Naxus <a id="l14454"></a>was first inhabited by the Thracians in the days of Boreas the father <a id="l14455"></a>of Caluis &amp; Zethas &amp; husband of Orithia the daughter of Erechtheus.  Samus was <a id="l14456"></a>at first desolate &amp; inhabited only by a great multitude of terrible wild beasts <a id="l14457"></a>Aristæus who married Autonoe the daughter of Cadmus carried a colony from <a id="l14458"></a>Thebes into Cæa an island not inhabited before.  The island Rhodes was at <a id="l14459"></a>first called Ophiusa being full of serpents before Phorbas a Prince of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017v"> &lt;17v&gt; </span> Argos went thither &amp;  made it habitable by destroying the <a id="l14460"></a>srepents, in memory of which he is delineated in the heavens in the <a id="l14461"></a>constellation of Ophinchus.  Crete was first inhabited by the Idæi <a id="l14462"></a>Dactyli who lived in caves &amp; by their arts &amp; religious mysteries seem to have been <a id="l14463"></a> Priests either of Phenicia or Egypt.  And Cyprus which lay <a id="l14464"></a>near Phœnicia seems to have been peopled not long before the days <a id="l14465"></a>of Cadmus ffor Eratosthenes tells us that Cyprus was at first so <a id="l14466"></a>overgrown with wood that it could not be tilled, &amp; that they first <a id="l14467"></a>cut down the wood for melting of Copper &amp; silver, &amp; afterwards <a id="l14468"></a>when they began to sail safely upon the mediterranean they <a id="l14469"></a>built ships &amp; even navies of it, &amp; when by this means they <a id="l14470"></a>could not destroy the wood they gave every man leave to cut <a id="l14471"></a>down what wood he pleased &amp; to possess all the grownd which <a id="l14472"></a>he cleared of wood.  So Europe abounded at first very much <a id="l14473"></a>with woods, one of which called the Hercynian took up a great <a id="l14474"></a>part of Germany &amp; Sarmatia, being above nine days journeys <a id="l14475"></a>broad &amp; 40 long in Cæsars days: but now those woods are <a id="l14476"></a>almost cut down to make room for inhabitants.</p>
<p id="par1959">19.  Before the Greek seas began to be navigated its <a id="l14477"></a>reasonable to believe that Europe was peopled from the back<a id="l14478"></a>side of the  Euxine sea, &amp; lake Mœotis  &amp; that the <a id="l14479"></a>first people  lived without touns or houses like the old Scythians &amp; spake the <a id="l14480"></a>Scythian,  Sarmatan &amp; German languages,  And that the Greek <a id="l14481"></a>language was introduced afterwards by colonies which came by sea <a id="l14482"></a>from Ægypt &amp; Phenicia &amp; chiefly from Asia minor where <a id="l14483"></a>Moses places the posterity of  Iavan.  ffor there the <a id="l14484"></a>Greek language was first cultivated as is manifest by the <a id="l14485"></a>poem of Homer notwithstanding that the Greeks out of vanity would have <a id="l14486"></a>Ionia to be a colony of Greece.</p>
<p id="par1960">20.  The colonies which came with Cecrops, Lelex, Pelasgus, <a id="l14487"></a>Inachus Æolus &amp; their contemporaries being acquainted with the making of brick in Egypt began first to build  houses <a id="l14488"></a>&amp; towns with their villages &amp; to form themselves into governments with a Prytaneum <a id="l14489"></a> &amp; a perpetual fire for sacrifices in every town.  Those which <a id="l14490"></a>came with Cadmus &amp; his brothers &amp; sister Europa brought in <a id="l14491"></a>letters &amp; the digging excocting &amp; manufacturing of metals &amp; the fabric &amp; use of <a id="l14492"></a>edged tools  &amp; Minos thereby got up a fleet of  round ships, <a id="l14493"></a>&amp; Dædalus  &amp; Talus improved the art of working in wood for building <a id="l14494"></a>of houses &amp; Temples &amp; making statues. ffor they invented the Chip-ax &amp; saw &amp; wimble &amp; perpendicular &amp; compass &amp; turning-lath &amp; glew. Cadmus found gold &amp; copper in the Pangean <a id="l14495"></a>mountain &amp; from him the copper stone has ever since been called <a id="l14496"></a>Cadmia.  The Idæi Dactyli soon after found Iron in mount Ida <a id="l14497"></a>in Crete &amp; began to work it into  armour &amp; utensils, &amp; <a id="l14498"></a>brought in poetry &amp; musick by dancing  in ther armour &amp; <a id="l14499"></a>striking upon the armour with their weapons to keep time to the musick. And <a id="l14500"></a>Rhadamanthus carried Thoas one of those Phenician artificers  from  Crete &amp; <a id="l14501"></a>gave him the island Lemnos where he became famous for his skill <a id="l14502"></a>He invented the hammer &amp; anvil &amp; tongues &amp; laver &amp; the making of tiles. He  bought Calycope of her father Areus a king of some part <a id="l14503"></a>of Phrygia &amp; lived with her afterwards in Cyprus  &amp; Byblus &amp; grew exceeding rich even to a proverb, &amp; lived very long. ffrom his skill upon the harp <a id="l14505"></a>he was called Cinyras.  She had Æneas by Anchises &amp; lay also with <a id="l14506"></a>Sesostris the Mars of the Thracians just before he passed the Helespont <a id="l14507"></a>into Thrace &amp; by that means she obteined  Cyprus &amp; Byblus for her husband. <a id="l14508"></a>And he deified her after her death, &amp; built  a Temple to her in Cyprus &amp; institu<a id="l14509"></a>ted Priests to her with  sacred rites &amp; obscæne initiations &amp; became her chief Priest himself, &amp; was <a id="l14510"></a>buried in the same Temple &amp; became the  Baal of  the place &amp; the Baal-Canaan or Vulcan <a id="l14511"></a>of the Latins.  She lay with Gingris  the son of Cinyras &amp; deified him after <a id="l14512"></a>death by the name of Adonis, &amp; caused him to be worshipped after the manner of <a id="l14513"></a>Osiris &amp;Tammuz.</p>

<p id="par1962" class="i0">– – – long remembred.</p>
<p id="par1963"> Since the Phenicians who stole Io carried her into <a id="l14519"></a>Egypt, it is evident that they then traded between Egypt &amp; Greece.  Now <a id="l14520"></a>the principal trafic with Egypt has in all ages been for <a id="l14521"></a>corn. This was a commodity with which Ægypt allways abounded &amp; which <a id="l14522"></a>Greece then wanted. ffor plowing &amp; sowing was not yet in <a id="l14523"></a>use among the Greeks. When Solomon desired Hiram king <a id="l14524"></a>of Tyre to send him timeber for  his buildings he <a id="l14525"></a> gave Hiram for the timber, 20000 measures of wheat &amp; <a id="l14526"></a>20000 measures of barley &amp; 20000 baths of wine &amp; 20000 <a id="l14527"></a>baths of oyle.  Whence it seems that the people of Tyre <a id="l14528"></a>wanted corn in proportion to their people &amp; therefore  Egypt being neare them, they <a id="l14530"></a>would be apt to send Merchants thither for  what they wanted, &amp; this might occasion a trafic between Egypt &amp; Phenicia <a id="l14532"></a>some time before the Phenicians began to sail as far as <a id="l14533"></a>Greece. ffor when the Philistims took Sidon, some of Sidon <a id="l14534"></a>made their escape by sea to Tyre, which  without shipping <a id="l14535"></a>they could not have done. When therefore the Phenicians <a id="l14536"></a>began to sail as far as Greece &amp; to set on foot a trade between <a id="l14537"></a> Greece &amp; Egypt, it may justly be presumed that the principal <a id="l14538"></a>commodity with which they supplied the Greeks from Egypt was <a id="l14539"></a>corn. And this was first done in the days of Erectheus <a id="l14540"></a>king of Athens &amp; of Myles the son of Lelex king of Laconia</p>
<p id="par1964">Erechtheus had several sons – – – – –  From all which <a id="l14541"></a>compared together I conclude that Erechtheus was about <a id="l14542"></a>three generations (or an hundred years) older then the Argonauts &amp; so was contemporary <a id="l14543"></a>to Cadmus  &amp; might begin his reign about 20 or 30 years  before Solomon  Now  Erechtheus   in a time of famin  procured <a id="l14545"></a>a great quantity of corn from Egypt &amp; for this benefaction the people <a id="l14546"></a>of Athens made him their king: And therefore the trafic of carrying <a id="l14547"></a>corn from Egypt to Greece began before his reign.</p>

<p id="par1968">When the Phenicians brought corn from Egypt into Greece they <a id="l14568"></a>would be apt to bring weomen from Egypt to instruct &amp; assist the Greeks in <a id="l14569"></a>making of bread for promoting the merchandise of the corn, especially when <a id="l14570"></a>they brought a great quantity of corn out of Egypt for Erechtheus. ffor <a id="l14571"></a>at that time Ceres is said to have come to Athens. She pretended to <a id="l14572"></a>come in quest of her daughter who perhaps had been carried away by <a id="l14573"></a>the merchants, &amp; under that pretence travelled from Athens to Eleusis <a id="l14574"></a>&amp; being there enterteined by the daughters of Celeus king of Eleusis <a id="l14575"></a>nurst up &amp; instructed his young son Triptolemus &amp; taught him how to <a id="l14576"></a>sow corn.  He sowed it in a field of Eleusine  <a id="l14577"></a>called Rharia from Rharus the father of Celeus &amp; son of Cranaus. <a id="l14578"></a> &amp; as the corn increased he dispersed it <a id="l14579"></a>over the cities of Greece  &amp; this was the ori<a id="l14580"></a>ginal of  sowing corn in Greece.  Afterwards Osiris (who is Sesostris) coming into <a id="l14581"></a>Greece taught them how to till the grownd with Oxen whereas till then <a id="l14582"></a>they tilled it with their hand-labour.</p>
<p id="par1969"> Ceres lay with Iasion the brother of Harmonia the wife of Cadmus <a id="l14583"></a> &amp; Triptolemus lived till Sesostris or Osiris came into Greece. And therefore <a id="l14584"></a> Ceres came into Greece in the days of Cadmus &amp;  taught the sowing of corn  towards the end  of Davids reign. After <a id="l14586"></a>her  death  Celeus Eumolpus &amp; other Greeks  in memory of these things instituted the <a id="l14587"></a>Eleusina sacra with ceremonies brought from Egypt. And soon after was the <a id="l14588"></a>war between the Athenians &amp; Eleusinians in which Erechtheus on one <a id="l14589"></a>side &amp; Immaradus the son of Eumolpus on the other side were slain. This war therefore <a id="l14590"></a>putting an end to the reign of Erechtheus seems to have been about the middle of Solomons reign:  for Erechtheus  reigned long Then reigned Cecrops &amp; Pandion in the days of Solomon &amp; Ægeus <a id="l14593"></a>in the days of Rehoboam.

<p id="par1972"> Erechtheus was the son of Pandion the son of  Erichthonius, &amp; I take <a id="l14604"></a>Erichthonius to be an Egyptian.

But <a id="l14613"></a>I do not  take him  or his son Pandion to have been king of  <a id="l14614"></a>Athens. Erechtheus seems to be the first of the family who reigned <a id="l14615"></a>there.  For he  was elected king for  procuring a great quantity of corn from Egypt in a famin, <sup class="note" id="n243-ref">[243]</sup>&amp; then he changed the name of <a id="l14617"></a>the  <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>people<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> from  Cranaans to  Athenians.

<span class="pagenumber" id="p251r"> &lt;251r&gt; </span>

<p id="par1974" class="i0">and therefore I  reccon not Erechthonius but Erechtheus to be the successor of <a id="l14644"></a>Amphictyon, or if you please of Cranaus: for Amphictyon was  not so old the Amphictyonic council not being in<a id="l14645"></a>stituted till the reign of Theseus.  Cranaus  was the father of <a id="l14646"></a>Rharus the father of Celeus  &amp;  therefore  scarce  two <a id="l14647"></a>generations older then Erectheus. And if Cecrops was of about <a id="l14648"></a>the same age with  Cranaus or but a little older he <a id="l14649"></a>will be contemporary to Samuel &amp; Saul.</p>
<p id="par1975">So then Cecrops, Erechthonius, &amp; Lelex were contemporary to <a id="l14650"></a>Samuel &amp; in his reign  led colonies from Egypt into Greece. <a id="l14651"></a>Its probable that  when the Theban army under <a id="l14652"></a> Misphragmuthosis invaded &amp; subdued <a id="l14653"></a> the lower Egypt &amp;  a great body <a id="l14654"></a>of the Shepherds retred to Abaris &amp; were there shut up, others <a id="l14655"></a>amongst whom were Cecrops, Erechthonius &amp; Lelex &amp; perhaps Pelasgus) escaped out of the  Canobic ostium of the Nile in such vessels <a id="l14656"></a>as they could meet with upon that river &amp; fled to Libya, Phenicia, <a id="l14657"></a>Cyprus, Asia minor &amp; Greece,  ffor the Athenians were recconed a colony of Egyptians coming from Sais a Province of Egypt upon the Canobic ostium of the Nile. These lived for a while without  commerce <a id="l14659"></a>with Phenicia &amp; Egypt, &amp; only  endeavoured to reduce the <a id="l14660"></a>Greekes from a salvage way of life,  but in the next generation when a new king of <a id="l14662"></a>Egypt had driven the shepherds out of Abaris into Phœnicia <a id="l14663"></a>&amp; the Philistims took Sidon &amp; made the inhabitants fly by <a id="l14664"></a>sea to Tyre &amp; perhaps to some other remoter places &amp; Saul <a id="l14665"></a>&amp; David beat the Philistims &amp; Moabites &amp; Ammonites &amp; drove the  Edomites  from the red <a id="l14667"></a>sea to the mediterranean, these nations , partly to seek new seats &amp; partly to get <a id="l14669"></a>a livelyhood  by trafic sailed as far as Greece &amp; <a id="l14670"></a>supplied the Greeks with corn from Egypt. And then did Cadmus <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p251v"> &lt;251v&gt; </span> carry a colony into Greece&amp;  his brother <a id="l14671"></a>Thasus another into  Thasus &amp; Proteus another into an island neare Thrace &amp; Cilix <a id="l14672"></a>another &amp; Proteus another into  Bisaltia <a id="l14673"></a>in  Thrace.</p>
<p id="par1976">Cecrops is therefore justly recconed one of the first Egyptians <a id="l14674"></a>who led colonies into Greece He joyned one man &amp; one woman &amp; first called Iupiter God &amp; set up <a id="l14675"></a>an altar at Athens &amp; after him came in  the  whole genealogy <a id="l14676"></a>of the Gods of Greece.  He was the first <a id="l14678"></a>that  reduced the people of Attica into cities, Phoroneus the first that built cities about Argos  <a id="l14679"></a>Polycaon the son of Lelex the first that built cities in Messene <a id="l14680"></a> &amp; Lycaon the first that built cities in  Arcadia. Till then the <a id="l14681"></a>people lived disperst in villages: &amp; by this circumstance you may know <a id="l14682"></a>that these men lived much about the same time.  Cecrops in sailing from <a id="l14684"></a>Egypt by  these coasts came  to Phœnicia &amp;  <a id="l14685"></a>Cyprus &amp; then to Greece. He seems to be one of the shepherds because a <a id="l14686"></a>colony which he left in Cyprus sacrificed yearly a man to his daughter Agraulis, an <a id="l14687"></a>impiety which the genuine Egyptians were free from. By the like colonies <a id="l14688"></a>the sacrificing of men came also into Greece. For Erechtheus sacrificed his <a id="l14689"></a>daughter &amp; therefore   his  family was of  the race of the shepherds. <a id="l14690"></a>But circumcision (the religion of the genuine Egyptians) was not any <a id="l14691"></a>where in Greece introduced by any of the Colonies.</p>
<p id="par1977">Cadmus pretending to be sent  – – – – shepherds.  Strabo lets us know – –  king of their country.  Some think that the letters which <a id="l14695"></a>Cadmus brought  into Europe  came originally out <a id="l14696"></a>of Egypt: but  since Cecrops Erichthonius &amp; Lelex  came from <a id="l14697"></a>Egypt without letters, I take these letters to be Phenician as they have been <a id="l14698"></a>always  accounted.  Navigation  &amp; Merchandise occasioned the invention <a id="l14699"></a>of Astronomy &amp; Arithmetic &amp; letters were as necessary to a Merchant <a id="l14700"></a>&amp; therefore its reasonable to ascribe the invention of all these things to the Phenicians or  if you please <a id="l14701"></a>to the  inhabitants of the red sea who were the first Merchants. There <a id="l14702"></a>Moses might learn them when he dwelt in the land of Midian, &amp; from <a id="l14703"></a>thence the Erythreans might bring them into Phœnicia. </p>

He adds that <a id="l14708"></a>the Phœnicians who came with Cadmus  of whom the Gephyre<a id="l14709"></a>ans were a part, brought many doctrines into Greece &amp; particularly letters &amp; <a id="l14710"></a>that the Iones learnt letters of the Phœnicians &amp; called them Phœnician letters <a id="l14711"></a> Since these Gephyrans were originally Erythreans its probable that the city Erythræ  in Bœotia   was built by Erythreans who <a id="l14712"></a>came with Cadmus. </p>

<p id="par1995"> One fault of the  Chronology of  Manetho is that by <a id="l14849"></a>summing up all the dynasties  it makes the Monarchy of Egypt  <a id="l14850"></a>too  old. ffor  the  Dynasties  collected in several cities ought to be considered singly.</p>

<p id="par1997">Thus you see there is nothing in the Dynasties of Manetho <a id="l14853"></a>so old as Moses.

<p id="par1999" class="i0">At that time Artaxerxes Ochus king of Persia carried away all <a id="l14871"></a>the records of the Egyptians &amp; Manetho about 80 years after wrote <a id="l14872"></a>history of the kings of Egypt, which has since been  altered <a id="l14873"></a>by Africanus.

[And if <a id="l14926"></a>more kings are to be added they must be inserted  between  Menes &amp; Mœris.] Which makes <a id="l14928"></a>it probable that as the Greeks have inserted fourteen feigned kings of Sicyon <a id="l14929"></a>between  Apis &amp; Epopeus to make that kingdom look ancient, so the Egyptians <a id="l14930"></a>to make their  Monarchy &amp; their Gods look ancient have inserted above <a id="l14931"></a>three hundred feigned kings between  Menes &amp; Mœris. And this is the more probable <a id="l14932"></a>becaus Osiris in the opinion of the ancient Egyptians themselves was one &amp; the same <a id="l14933"></a>person with the great Bacchus &amp; this Bacchus was contemporary to Ariadne <a id="l14934"></a>&amp; Theseus &amp; was the same king of Egypt with Sesostris &amp; Sesac. And before the <a id="l14935"></a>Egyptians had corrupted their antiquities the Greeks deified Bacchus the son of Semele <a id="l14936"></a>with the sacred rites of Osiris &amp; feigned that Io the daughter of Inachus was carried <a id="l14937"></a>into Egypt &amp; became the Goddess Isis.

And the like has happened in <a id="l14951"></a>the region of Troy &amp; Phrygia. ffor Priamus king of Troy was the son of Laomedon the son of Ilus the son of <a id="l14952"></a>Tros the son of Erichthonius the son of Dardanus  the son in law of Teucer &amp; therefore Teucer was five generations or about 100 <a id="l14953"></a>years older then Priamus  &amp; so flourished <a id="l14954"></a> in the days of Eli &amp; Samuel.  Erichthonius had a  numerous breed of horses. Dardanus is said to be the brother of Iasion who lay with Ceres in the reign <a id="l14955"></a>of David. And his  wife's father Teucer is the first king of the Trojans mentioned in history. Let <a id="l14956"></a>this therefore remain a truth that  the antiquities of the several kingdoms of Greece &amp; Troy reach about 3 or 4 generations higher then the first use of letters &amp; that there is no memory now remaining of any <a id="l14957"></a>thing done in Euroe &amp; Asia minor before the High-priesthood of Eli. </p>

<p id="par2016">And indeed Europe was not peopled very long before.  ffor Diodorus tells us ② that the Cyclad Islands <a id="l14980"></a>were at first desolate &amp; uninhabited but Minos the son of Europa king of Crete having a powerfull fleet <a id="l14981"></a>sent many colonies out of Crete &amp; peopled many of the Cyclades &amp;  particularly that <a id="l14982"></a>Carpathus was first seized by the soldiers of Minos.

<p id="par2037" class="i0">The Poet here attributes the founding of the Medo-Persian <a id="l15073"></a>Empire to the two immediate predecessors of Cyrus, the first <a id="l15074"></a>of which was a Mede, &amp; the second was his son. The second <a id="l15075"></a>was Darius the Mede, the immediate predecessor of Cyrus, <a id="l15076"></a>according to Daniel; &amp; therefore the first was the father <a id="l15077"></a>of Darius, that is, Achsuerus, Assuerus, Oxyares, Axeres <a id="l15078"></a>or Cy-Axeres. For Daniel tells us that Darius was the <a id="l15079"></a>son of Achsuerus (or Ahasuerus, as the Masoretes erroneously <a id="l15080"></a>call him) of the seed of the Medes, that is, of the seed royal. <a id="l15081"></a>This is that Assuerus who together with Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l15082"></a>took &amp; destroyed Nineveh according to Tobit: which action <a id="l15083"></a>is by the Greeks ascribed to Cyaxeres &amp; by Eupolemus to <a id="l15084"></a>Astibares a name perhaps corruptly written for Assuerus. By this victory over the Asyrians, &amp; subver<a id="l15085"></a>sion of their kingdom seated at Nineveh, &amp; the ensuing <a id="l15086"></a>conquests of Armenia Cappadocia &amp; Persia, he began to <a id="l15087"></a>extend the reign of one man over all Asia; &amp; his son <a id="l15088"></a>Darius the Mede, by conquering the kingdoms of Lydia &amp; <a id="l15089"></a>Babylon finished the work: &amp; the third king was Cyrus <a id="l15090"></a>a happy man for his great successes under &amp; against Darius, <a id="l15091"></a>a large &amp; peaceable dominion in his own reign.</p>
<p id="par2038">Cyrus lived seventy years according to Cicero, &amp; <a id="l15092"></a>reigned nine years over Babylon according to Ptolomy's <a id="l15093"></a>Canon, &amp; therefore was 61 years old at the taking of <a id="l15094"></a>Babylon: at which time Darius the Mede was 62 years <a id="l15095"></a>old according to Daniel. And therefore Darius was two <a id="l15096"></a>generations younger then Astyages the grandfather of <a id="l15097"></a>Cyrus. For Astyages (according to Herodotus &amp; Xenophon<sup class="note" id="n248-ref">[248]</sup>) <a id="l15098"></a>gave his daughter Mandane to Cambyses a Prince of Persia, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p261r"> &lt;261r&gt; </span> and by them became the grandfather of Cyrus, &amp; Cyaxeres <a id="l15099"></a>was the son of Astyages (according to Xenophon<sup class="note" id="n249-ref">[249]</sup>) &amp; gave <a id="l15100"></a>his daughter to Cyrus. This daughter, saith Xenophon,<sup class="note" id="n250-ref">[250]</sup> <a id="l15101"></a>was reported to be very handsome &amp; used to play with <a id="l15102"></a>Cyrus when they were both children, &amp; to say that she <a id="l15103"></a>would marry him; &amp; therefore they were much of the <a id="l15104"></a>same age. Xenophon saith that Cyrus married her after <a id="l15105"></a>the taking of Babylon: but she was then an old woman. <a id="l15106"></a>Its more probable that he married her while she was <a id="l15107"></a>young &amp; handsom &amp; he a young man; &amp; that because he <a id="l15108"></a>was the brother in law of Darius the king, he led the armies <a id="l15109"></a>of the kingdom untill he revolted. So then Astyages, <a id="l15110"></a>Cyaxeres &amp; Darius reigned successively over the Medes; <a id="l15111"></a>&amp; Cyrus was the grandson of Astyages &amp; married the <a id="l15112"></a>sister of Darius &amp; succeeded him in the throne.</p>

<p id="par2040">Of all the kings of the Medes Cyaxeres was the greatest <a id="l15168"></a>warrior.

<p id="par2041">In the fourth year of Iehojakim, which the Iews reccon <a id="l15186"></a>to be the first of Nebuchadnezzar (dating his reign,  fom his being made king by his father , or <a id="l15189"></a>from the month Nisan preceding) when the Victors had newly <a id="l15190"></a>shared the Empire of the Assyrians, &amp; in prosecuting their <a id="l15191"></a>victory were invading Syria &amp; Phenicia &amp; were ready to <a id="l15192"></a>invade the nations round about: God threatned<sup class="note" id="n256-ref">[256]</sup> that he would <a id="l15193"></a>take all the families of the north (that is the Medes) and <a id="l15194"></a>Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, &amp; bring them against <a id="l15195"></a>Iudea &amp; against the nations round about, &amp; utterly destroy <a id="l15196"></a>those nations &amp; make them an astonishment &amp; lasting de<a id="l15197"></a>solations, &amp; cause them all to drink the wine-cup of his <a id="l15198"></a>fury: and in particular names the kings of Iudah &amp; E<a id="l15199"></a>gypt, &amp; those of Edom &amp; Moab &amp; Ammon &amp; Tyre &amp; Sidon, <a id="l15200"></a>&amp; the Isles of the sea, &amp; Arabia &amp; Zimri, &amp; all the kings of <a id="l15201"></a>Elam, &amp; all the kings of the Medes, &amp; all the kings of the <a id="l15202"></a>north, &amp; the king of Sesack: &amp; that after 70 years he <a id="l15203"></a>would also punish the king of Babylon.

<p id="par2042">After this, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, <a id="l15213"></a>that is, in the ninth year of Nebuchadnezzar, God threatned <a id="l15214"></a>that he would give the kingdoms of <em class="underline">Edom &amp; Moab &amp; Ammon <a id="l15215"></a>&amp; Tyre &amp; Zidon into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of <a id="l15216"></a>Babylon, &amp; that all the nations should serve him &amp; his son <a id="l15217"></a>&amp; his son's son untill the time of his land should come, <a id="l15218"></a>&amp; many nations &amp; great kings should serve themselves <a id="l15219"></a>of him</em> (Ier. XXVII.) And at the same time God thus predicted <a id="l15220"></a>the approaching conquest of the Persians by the Medes &amp; their <a id="l15221"></a>confederates. <em class="underline">Behold</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">I will break the bow of Elam <a id="l15222"></a>the chief of their might.

For I will cause Elam <a id="l15226"></a>to be dismayed before their enemies &amp; before them that seek <a id="l15227"></a>their life: &amp; I will bring evill upon them even my fierce <a id="l15228"></a>anger, saith the Lord, &amp; I will send the sword after them till <a id="l15229"></a>I have consumed them. And I will set my throne in Elam, &amp; <a id="l15230"></a>will destroy from thence the King &amp; the Prince, saith the <a id="l15231"></a>Lord. But it shalll come to pass in the latter days</em> (viz<sup>t</sup> in <a id="l15232"></a>the reign of Cyrus) <em class="underline">that I will bring again the captivity <a id="l15233"></a>of Elam saith the Lord</em>. Ier. XLIX.54. The Persians were <a id="l15234"></a>therefore hitherto a free nation under their own king, but <a id="l15235"></a>soon after this were invaded subdued captivated &amp; dispersed <a id="l15236"></a>into the nations round about, &amp; continued in servitude untill <a id="l15237"></a>the reign of Cyrus. And since the Medes &amp; Chaldeans did not <a id="l15238"></a>conquer the Persians till after the ninth year of Nebuchad<a id="l15239"></a>nezzar: it gives us occasion to enquire what that active warrior <a id="l15240"></a>Cyaxeres was doing in the ten years next after the taking of Nineveh.</p><span class="pagenumber" id="p263r"> &lt;263r&gt; </span>
<p id="par2043">Now Herodotus tells us that presently after that conquest <a id="l15241"></a>Cyaxeres drave out of his kingdom the remainder of the Scy<a id="l15242"></a>thians who had reigned in Asia 28 years, &amp; made them retire <a id="l15243"></a>through the regions between the Caspian &amp; Euxine seas into <a id="l15244"></a>the regions of Scythia neare the Lake Mœotis, &amp; warred with <a id="l15245"></a>Alyattes king of Lydia five years, conquering all the regions <a id="l15246"></a>between them as far as to the river Halys. For so far the <a id="l15247"></a>Empire of the Assyrians had extended. And that in the sixt <a id="l15248"></a>year of this war in the time of a battel, the two armies were <a id="l15249"></a>parted by a total Eclips of the Sun which was predicted by <a id="l15250"></a>Thales, &amp; then the two kings made peace by the mediation of <a id="l15251"></a>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon &amp; Syennesis king of Cilicia, <a id="l15252"></a>&amp; the peace was ratified by a marriage between Astyages <a id="l15253"></a>the son of Cyaxeres &amp; Ariene the daughter of Alyattes. <a id="l15254"></a>This total Eclips fell upon the year of Nabonassar 147 <a id="l15255"></a>Apr. 28 between 9 &amp; 10 of the clock in the morning, as the calculation <a id="l15256"></a>shews. And therefor the war with Alyattes began in the <a id="l15257"></a>year of Nabonassar 142 which was the fourth year of Ie<a id="l15258"></a>hojakim, the very same year in which Nebuchadnezzar <a id="l15259"></a>came against Pharaoh Nechaoh &amp; invaded Syria. These <a id="l15260"></a>two kings therefore as soon as they had taken &amp; destroyed <a id="l15261"></a>Nineveh, went westward &amp; expelled the Scythians in those <a id="l15262"></a>parts, &amp; seized all the western provinces of the Assyrians in <a id="l15263"></a>Armenia, Pontus, Cappadocia, Syria Palestine &amp; Arabia <a id="l15264"></a>Petrea: &amp; then making peace with Alyattes king of <a id="l15265"></a>Lydia, they went eastward, &amp; in the reign of Zedekiah <a id="l15266"></a>conquered the Persians.</p>
<p id="par2044">Afterwards, in the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign <a id="l15267"></a>or nineteenth of Nebuchadnezzar, Ezekiel comparing the <a id="l15268"></a>kingdoms of the east to trees in the garden of Eden, thus men<a id="l15269"></a>tions their being conquered by the kings of the Medes &amp; Chal<a id="l15270"></a>deans. <em class="underline">Behold</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">the Assyrian was a cedar in Leba<a id="l15271"></a>non with fair branches</em> – <em class="underline">his height was exalted above all <a id="l15272"></a>the trees of the field – &amp; under his shadow dwelt all great <a id="l15273"></a>nations</em> – <em class="underline">no tree in the garden of God was like unto him <a id="l15274"></a>in his beauty</em> – <em class="underline">but I have delivered him into the hand <a id="l15275"></a>of the mighty one of the heathen</em> – <em class="underline">I made the nations <a id="l15276"></a>to shake at the sound of his falll when I cast him down to <a id="l15277"></a> the grave with them that descend into the pit.

They also went down into the grave with <a id="l15281"></a>him, unto them that be slain with the sword, &amp; they <a id="l15282"></a>that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in <a id="l15283"></a>the midst of the heathen</em>. Ezek. XXXI.</p>
<p id="par2045">The next year Ezekiel in another Prophesy, thus <a id="l15284"></a>enumerates the principal nations who had been subdued <a id="l15285"></a>&amp; slaughtered by the conquering sword of Cyaxeres and <a id="l15286"></a>Nebuchadnezzar. <em class="underline">Ashur is there &amp; all her company</em> <a id="l15287"></a>[viz<sup>t</sup> in Hades or the lower parts of the earth where the <a id="l15288"></a>dead bodies lay buried] <em class="underline">his graves are about him, all of <a id="l15289"></a>them slain fallen by the sword</em> – <em class="underline">which caused their <a id="l15290"></a>terror in the land of the living.

Ezek. <a id="l15302"></a>XXXII. Here by the Princes of the north I understand those <a id="l15303"></a>on the north of Iudea, &amp; chiefly the Princes of Armenia <a id="l15304"></a>&amp; Cappadocia who fell in the warrs which Cyaxeres made <a id="l15305"></a>in conquering those countries. Elam or Persia was conquered <a id="l15306"></a>by the Medes &amp; Susiana by the Babylonians after the ninth <a id="l15307"></a>&amp; before the ninetheenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. And there<a id="l15308"></a>fore we cannot err much if we place these conquests in the <a id="l15309"></a>twelft or fourteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. In the nine<a id="l15310"></a>teenth twentith &amp; one &amp; twentith year of this king he invaded <a id="l15311"></a>&amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n257-ref">[257]</sup> conquered Iudea, Moab, Ammon, Edom, the Philistims, &amp; Zidon; <a id="l15312"></a>&amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n258-ref">[258]</sup> the next year he besieged Tyre &amp; after a siege of 13 <a id="l15313"></a>years he took it in the 35<sup>th</sup> year of his reign, &amp; then he <a id="l15314"></a><sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n259-ref">[259]</sup> invaded &amp; conquered  Egypt, Ethiopia &amp; Libya  <a id="l15316"></a>And about eighteen or twenty years after the death of this king, Darius <a id="l15317"></a>the Mede conquered the kingdom of Sardes, &amp; after five or <a id="l15318"></a>six years more he invaded &amp; conquered the Empire of Baby<a id="l15319"></a>lon &amp; thereby finished the work of propagating the Medo-<a id="l15320"></a>Persian Monarchy over all Asia, as Æschylus represents.</p>
<p id="par2046">Now this is that Darius who coined a great number <a id="l15321"></a>of pieces of pure gold called <em class="underline">Darics</em> or <em class="underline">Stateres Darici</em>. For <a id="l15322"></a>Suidas Harpocration &amp; the Scholiast of Aristophanes tell us <a id="l15323"></a>that these were coined not by the father of Xerxes but by <a id="l15324"></a>an earlier Darius, by Darius the first, by the first king of <a id="l15325"></a>the Medes &amp; Persians who coyned gold money.  They were <a id="l15326"></a>stamped on one side with the Effigies of an Archer crowned <a id="l15327"></a>who had a bow in his left hand &amp; an arrow in his right &amp; was <a id="l15328"></a>cloathed with a long robe. ffor I have seen one of them in gold <a id="l15329"></a>&amp; another in silver. They were of the same weight &amp; value <a id="l15330"></a>with the Attic stater or piece of gold money weighing two <a id="l15331"></a>Attic drachms. Darius seems to have learnt the art &amp; use <a id="l15332"></a>of money from the conquered kingdom of the Lydians, &amp; to have <a id="l15333"></a>recoined their gold. For the Medes before they conquered the <a id="l15334"></a>Lydians, had no money. Herodotus tells us<sup class="note" id="n260-ref">[260]</sup> that when Crœsus <a id="l15335"></a>was preparing to invade Cyrus, a certain Lydian called <a id="l15336"></a>Sandanis advised Crœsus that he was preparing an expedition <a id="l15337"></a>against a nation who were cloathed with leather breeches <a id="l15338"></a>&amp; made all their garments of leather, who eat not such <a id="l15339"></a>victuals as they would but such as their barren country <a id="l15340"></a>afforded, who drank no wine but water only, who eat no <a id="l15341"></a>figgs nor other good meat, who had nothing to lose but might <a id="l15342"></a>get much from the Lydians. For the Persians, saith Hero<a id="l15343"></a>dotus, before they conquered the Lydians had nothing rich or <a id="l15344"></a>valuable. And Isaias tells us<sup class="note" id="n261-ref">[261]</sup> that the Medes regarded not <a id="l15345"></a>silver nor desired gold. But the Lydians &amp; Phrygians were <a id="l15346"></a>exceeding rich even to a proverb. <sup class="note" id="n262-ref">[262]</sup><em class="underline">Midas &amp; Crœsus</em>, saith <a id="l15347"></a>Pliny, <em class="underline">in infinitum possederant.

Talentum autem Ægyptium pondo <a id="l15353"></a>ctoginta capere Varro tradit</em>. What the Conqueror did with <a id="l15354"></a>all this gold &amp; silver appears by the Daricks. The Lydians, ac<a id="l15355"></a>cording to Herodotus,<sup class="note" id="n263-ref">[263]</sup> were the first who coined gold &amp; silver, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p265r"> &lt;265r&gt; </span> and Crœsus coined gold moneys in plenty called Crœsei, &amp; it <a id="l15356"></a>was not reasonable that the money of the kings of Lydia should <a id="l15357"></a>continue current after the overthrow of their kingdom: &amp; <a id="l15358"></a>therefore Darius recoined it with his own effigies in form of <a id="l15359"></a>an archer, but without altering the current weight &amp; value. <a id="l15360"></a>So then he reigned from before the conquest of Sardes till <a id="l15361"></a>after the conquest of Babylon.</p>
<p id="par2047">The conquest of Asia minor put the Greeks into <a id="l15362"></a>fear of the Medes. For Theognis who lived at Megara in <a id="l15363"></a>the very times of these wars, writes thus</p>
<div class="lg"><p class="l">Πίνωμεν χαρίεντα μετ᾽ ἀλλήλοισι λεγοντες</p>
<p>Μηδὴν τὸν Μηδων δειδιότες πόλεμον.</p></div>
<div class="lg"><p class="l">Let us drink talking pleasant things with one another,</p>
<p>Not fearing the war of the Medes.</p></div>
<p id="par2048" class="i0">And again</p>
<div class="lg"><p class="l">Αὐτὸς δὲ στρατὸν ὑβριστὴν Μήδων ἀπέρυκε</p>

<div class="lg"><p class="l">Thou Apollo, drive away the injurious army of the Medes</p>

<p class="l">And choruses of Pæans, &amp; acclamations about thy Altar.</p>
<p>For truly I am afraid, beholding the folly</p>
<p class="l">And sedition of the Greeks which corrupts the people. But thou Apollo</p>

<p id="par2049" class="i0">The Poet tells us further that discord had destroyed Magnesia <a id="l15364"></a>Colophon &amp; Smyrna (cities of Ionia &amp; Phrygia) &amp; would de<a id="l15365"></a>stroy the Greeks: which is as much as to say that the Medes <a id="l15366"></a>had then conquered those cities.</p>
<p id="par2050">The Medes therefore reigned till the taking of Sardes. And <a id="l15367"></a>further, according to Xenophon &amp; the Scriptures, they reigned <a id="l15368"></a>till the taking of Babylon. For Xenophon tells us<sup class="note" id="n264-ref">[264]</sup> that after <a id="l15369"></a>the taking of Babylon Cyrus went to the king of the Medes <a id="l15370"></a>at Ecbatane &amp; succeeded him in the kingdom.  And Ierome<sup class="note" id="n265-ref">[265]</sup> <a id="l15371"></a>that Babylon was taken by Darius king of the Medes &amp; his <a id="l15372"></a>kinsman Cyrus. And the scriptures tell us that Babylon was <a id="l15373"></a>destroyed by a nation out of the north (Ier. 50.3, 9, 41) by <a id="l15374"></a>the kingdoms of Ararat Minni (or Armenia) &amp; Ashche<a id="l15375"></a>naz (or Phrygia minor. Ier LI.27) by the Medes (Isa. XIII.<a id="l15376"></a>17, 19) by the kings of the Medes &amp; the captains &amp; rulers <a id="l15377"></a>thereof &amp; all the land of his dominion (Ier LI.11, 28.) <a id="l15378"></a>The kingdom of Babylon was numbred &amp; finished &amp; broken <a id="l15379"></a>&amp; given to the Medes &amp; Persians (Dan. V.) first to the Medes <a id="l15380"></a>under Darius &amp; then to the Persians under Cyrus. ffor <a id="l15381"></a>Darius reigned over Babylon like a conqueror, not observing <a id="l15382"></a>the laws of the Babylonians, but introducing the immutable <a id="l15383"></a>laws of the conquering nations the Medes &amp; Persians (Dan. <a id="l15384"></a>VI.8, 12, 15:) &amp; the Medes in his reign are set before the <a id="l15385"></a>Persians (Dan ib. et V.28, &amp; VIII.20) as the Persians were <a id="l15386"></a>afterwards in the reign of Cyrus &amp; his successors set <a id="l15387"></a>before the Medes (Esther I.3, 14, 18, 19. Dan. X.1, 20 &amp; XI.2) <a id="l15388"></a>which shews that in the reign of Darius the Medes were <a id="l15389"></a>uppermost.</p>
<p id="par2051">You may know also by the great number of Provinces <a id="l15390"></a>in the kingdom of Darius that he was king of the Medes &amp; <a id="l15391"></a>Persians. For upon the conquest of Babylon he set over the <a id="l15392"></a>whole kingdom an hundred &amp; twenty Princes (Dan. VI.I) &amp; after<a id="l15393"></a>wards when Cambyses &amp; Darius Hystaspes had added some new <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p266r"> &lt;266r&gt; </span> territories, the whole conteined but 127 Provinces (Esther I.1.)</p>
<p id="par2052">The same thing is also confirmed by Iosephus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n266-ref">[266]</sup> who writes <a id="l15394"></a>that Cyrus king [or Satrapa] of the Persians &amp; Darius king of <a id="l15395"></a>the Medes made war upon Balthassar whom the Babylonians called <a id="l15396"></a>Naboandel, &amp; besiegd him in Babylon the handwriting appearing <a id="l15397"></a>on the wall the night on which the city was taken, &amp; that Darius <a id="l15398"></a>being 62 years old, overthrew the kingdom of Babylon by the <a id="l15399"></a>help of his kinsman Cyrus, &amp; carried back Daniel with him into <a id="l15400"></a>Media &amp; there had him in great honour, &amp; that Daniel built <a id="l15401"></a>at <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n267-ref">[267]</sup> Susa a very beautifull &amp; admirable Tower in which the <a id="l15402"></a>kings of the Medes Persians &amp; Parthians were afterwards <a id="l15403"></a>buried, &amp; which continued entire &amp; was kept by Priests of <a id="l15404"></a>the Iewish nation until the days of Iosephus.</p>

<p id="par2057" class="i0"> who is mentioned in the book of Iudeth: for <a id="l15458"></a>the history of that king suits with these times.

And Herodotus tells the same story of a king of Assyria <a id="l15465"></a>who routed the Medes &amp; slew their king whom he calls Phraortes, <a id="l15466"></a>&amp; saith that in the time of this war the Assyrians were left <a id="l15467"></a>alone by the defection of the auxiliary nations, being otherwise in good <a id="l15468"></a>condition. Arphaxad was therefore the Phraortes of Herodotus <a id="l15469"></a>&amp; by consequence was slain in or near the beginning of the <a id="l15470"></a>reign of Iosiah.

<p id="par2058">After this war, Nebuchadonosor king of Assyria in the <a id="l15481"></a>18<sup>th</sup> year of his reign sent his captain Olofernes with a great <a id="l15482"></a>army to avenge himself on all the west country because they <a id="l15483"></a>had disobeyed his commandment, &amp; Olofernes went forth with <a id="l15484"></a>an army of 12000 horse &amp; 120000 foot of Assyrians Medes <a id="l15485"></a>&amp; Persians &amp; reduced Cilicia &amp; Mesopotamia &amp; Syria &amp; Da<a id="l15486"></a>mascus &amp; part of Arabia &amp; Ammon &amp; Edom &amp; Madian &amp; <a id="l15487"></a>then came against Iudæa. And this was done when the <a id="l15488"></a>government was in the hands of the High Priest &amp; Ancients <a id="l15489"></a>of Israel (Iudeth IV.8 &amp; VII.23) &amp; by consequence when Io<a id="l15490"></a>siah was a child. In times of prosperity the children of <a id="l15491"></a>Israel were apt to go after false Gods &amp; in times of affliction <a id="l15492"></a>to repent &amp; turn to the Lord. So Manasses a very wicked king <a id="l15493"></a>being captivated by the Assyrians repented &amp; being released <a id="l15494"></a>from captivity restored the worship of the true God. And so <a id="l15495"></a>when we are told that Iosiah in the eighth year of his reign <a id="l15496"></a>while he was yet young began to seek after the God of David <a id="l15497"></a>his father (2 Chron. XXIV.3) &amp; in the twelft year of his reign <a id="l15498"></a>began to purge Iudah &amp; Ierusalem from Idolatry &amp; to destroy <a id="l15499"></a>the high places &amp; groves &amp; altars &amp; images of Baalim, we may <a id="l15500"></a>understand that these acts of religion were occasioned by im<a id="l15501"></a>pending dangers &amp; escapes from danger. When Olofernes <a id="l15502"></a>came against the western nations &amp; spoiled them, then were <a id="l15503"></a>the Iews terrified, &amp; they fortified Iudæa &amp; cried unto God <a id="l15504"></a>with great fervency &amp; humbled themselves in sackcloth &amp; put <a id="l15505"></a>ashes on their heads &amp; cried unto the God of Israel that he <a id="l15506"></a>would not give their wives &amp; their children &amp; cities for a prey <a id="l15507"></a>&amp; the Temple for a profanation: &amp; the High Priest &amp; all the <a id="l15508"></a>Priests put on sackcloth &amp; ashes &amp; offered daily burnt offerings with <a id="l15509"></a>vows &amp; free gifts of the people (Iudeth IV) &amp; then began Iosiah <a id="l15510"></a>to seek after the God of his father David. And after Iudeth had <a id="l15511"></a>slain Olofernes, &amp; the Assyrians were fled &amp; the Iews who pur<a id="l15512"></a>sued them were returned to Ierusalem, they worshipped the Lord <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p269r"> &lt;269r&gt; </span> and offered burnt offerings &amp; free offerings &amp; gifts &amp; continued <a id="l15513"></a>feasting before the sanctuary for the space of three months <a id="l15514"></a>(Iudeth XVI.18) &amp; then did Iosiah purge Iudah &amp; Ierusalem <a id="l15515"></a>from Idolatry. Whence it seems to me that the 18<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l15516"></a>Nebuchadonosor fell in with the 7<sup>th</sup> or 8<sup>th</sup> of Iosiah, &amp; by consequence <a id="l15517"></a>the twelft of Iosiah with the two or three &amp; twentith of <a id="l15518"></a>Nebuchadonosor.</p>
<p id="par2059"><sup class="note" id="n272-ref">[272]</sup>At that time the Scythians under Madyas or Medus having in<a id="l15519"></a>vaded Media &amp; beat the Medes in battel,  went thence towards <a id="l15520"></a>Egypt but were met in Phœnicia by Psammiticus &amp; bought off <a id="l15521"></a>&amp; returning reigned over a great part of Asia but in the end <a id="l15522"></a>of about 28 years were many of them slain in a feast by the <a id="l15523"></a>Medes under the conduct of Cyaxeres just before the destruction <a id="l15524"></a>of Nineveh &amp; the rest fled, I think to their brethren in Parthia.</p>
<p id="par2060">The last king of Assyria called Saracus by Polyhistor was contemporary to Nabo<a id="l15525"></a>polasser king of Babylon &amp; to Astyages king of the Medes <a id="l15526"></a>For Nabopolasser married his son Nebuchadnezzar to Amyite <a id="l15527"></a>the daughter of Astyages.

This victory the Iews refer to the <a id="l15532"></a>Chaldeans, the Greeks to the Medes, Tobit, Polyhistor, Iosephus <a id="l15533"></a>&amp; Ctesias to both.

And thence <a id="l15537"></a>the time of the fall of the Assyrian empire is determi<a id="l15538"></a>ned the conquerors being then in their youth. In the reign <a id="l15539"></a>of Iosiah when Zephany prophesied, Nineveh &amp; the kingdom <a id="l15540"></a>of Assyria were standing &amp; their fall was predicted by <a id="l15541"></a>that prophet (Zeph.

XXIII.29. 2 Chron. XXXV.20.) But <a id="l15546"></a>in the third &amp; fourth year of Iehojakim the successor of <a id="l15547"></a>Iosiah, the two conquerors, having taken Nineveh &amp; finished <a id="l15548"></a>their war in Assyria, prosecuted the conquest westwards, &amp; <a id="l15549"></a>leading their victorious forces against the king of Egypt <a id="l15550"></a>as an invader of their right of conquest, they beat him <a id="l15551"></a>at Carchemish, &amp; took from him whatever he had newly <a id="l15552"></a>taken from the Assyrians (2 King. XXIV.7. Ier. XLVI.2. Eupo<a id="l15553"></a>lemus apud Euseb. Præp. l. 9. c. 39.) &amp; therefore we cannot err <a id="l15554"></a>above a year or two if we referr the destruction of Nineveh &amp; <a id="l15555"></a>fall of the Assyrian empire to the second year of Iehojakim, <a id="l15556"></a>Anno Nabonass. 140.</p>
<p id="par2061">While the Assyrians reigned at Nineveh Persia was divided <a id="l15557"></a>into several kingdoms.

<p id="par2067">And now the Assyrian Empire seems arrived at its <a id="l15640"></a>greatness, being united under one Monarch, &amp; conteining <a id="l15641"></a>Assyria, Media, Apolloniatis, Susiana, Chaldæa, Mesopotamia, <a id="l15642"></a> Cilicia, Syria, Phœnicia, Egypt, Ethiopia, &amp; part of Arabia, <a id="l15643"></a>&amp; reaching eastward into Elymais &amp; Parætacene. For <a id="l15644"></a>Strabo reccons these two among the Provinces to which the Mo<a id="l15645"></a>narchy had given the name of Assyria, &amp; Herodotus makes <a id="l15646"></a>Parætacene a province of the Medes. And if Chalach &amp; Habor <a id="l15647"></a>where Salmanasser placed part of the ten Tribes be Colchos <a id="l15648"></a>&amp; Iberia (as some think) we are also to add these two Pro<a id="l15649"></a>vinces with the two Armenias Pontus &amp; Cappadocia as far as the river Halys.</p>
<p id="par2068">Asserhadon seems to be the Sardanapalus who reigned over <a id="l15650"></a>Media &amp; Babylonia till those nations revolted, the name Sar<a id="l15651"></a>danapalus being derived from Asser-hadon-pul. Cleitarchus <a id="l15652"></a><sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n281-ref">[281]</sup> saith that he died of old age after he had lost his dominion <a id="l15653"></a>over Syria; others say that he slew himself. The Scythians <a id="l15654"></a>of Turan or Turquestan beyond the river Oxus, began in those <a id="l15655"></a>days to infest Persia. And perhaps by one of their inrodes might <a id="l15656"></a>give occasion to the revolt &amp; by another to the interregnum at Babylon <a id="l15657"></a>above mentioned. Herodotus represents that the Medes revolted first <a id="l15658"></a>&amp; by force of arms defended their liberty &amp; gave occasion to  other <a id="l15659"></a>nations to revolt, &amp; elected Dejoces their king &amp; built Ecbatane. And <a id="l15660"></a>perhaps they might revolt oftener then once. For others say that <a id="l15661"></a>they revolted under the conduct of  Arbaces who was a Mede &amp; one <a id="l15662"></a>of the general commanders of the forces of Sardanapalus.  <a id="l15663"></a>In the book of Iudeth (if I mistake not) he is called Arphaxad. For Ar<a id="l15664"></a>phaxad is there said to have built Ecbatane &amp; therefore reigned soon after the revolt. Arbaces was encouraged <a id="l15665"></a>to revolt by the luxurious &amp; effeminate life of his king, &amp; conspired <a id="l15666"></a>with Belisis another commander of the Assyrian forces. And Eusebius <a id="l15667"></a>tells us that the writers of the Babylonian affairs say that Arbaces <a id="l15668"></a>made Belisis king of the Assyrians. I suppose he meanes, king of so <a id="l15669"></a>much of the Assyrian Empire as after the revolt of the nations <a id="l15670"></a>remained in subjection to Nineveh. This revolution happened in the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p273r"> &lt;273r&gt; </span> year of Nabonassar 81. For at <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>that<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> time Asserhadon was succeeded at <a id="l15671"></a>Babylon by Saosduchinus. And by this revolution Manasses was set at<a id="l15672"></a>liberty to return home &amp; fortify Ierusalem. And the Egyptians <a id="l15673"></a>also, after the Assyrians had reigned three years over them <a id="l15674"></a>(Isa. XX.3, 4) were set at liberty &amp; created twelve contemporary <a id="l15675"></a>kings over themselves as above. </p>
<p id="par2069">Sardanapalus is said to have built Tarsus &amp; Anchiale in <a id="l15681"></a>one day &amp; to have been the son of Anacyndaraxes or Cyndaraxis or as others <a id="l15682"></a>name him, Anabaxaris. I suppose they mean Sennacherib. The <a id="l15683"></a>kings who reigned after him in Media were Dejoces, Phraortes, <a id="l15684"></a>Astyages, Cyaxeres &amp; Darius; those at Babylon were Saosdu<a id="l15685"></a>chinus, Chiniladon, Nabopolasser &amp; Nebuchadnezzar with his <a id="l15686"></a>sons: &amp; those at <a id="l15687"></a>Nineveh, I think, were  Saosduchinus, Nebuchado<a id="l15688"></a>nosor &amp; Saracus. By Nebuchadonosor I understand that <a id="l15689"></a> king of Assyria who is mentioned in the book of Iudeth. <a id="l15690"></a>For the history of that king suits with these times. For there it is said that Nebu<a id="l15691"></a>chadonosor in the twelft year of his reign made war upon <a id="l15692"></a>Arphaxad king of the Medes &amp;  was then left alone <a id="l15693"></a>by a defection of the auxiliary nations of Cilicia, Damascus, <a id="l15694"></a>Syria, Phœnicia, Moab, &amp; Ammon, &amp; Egypt, &amp; without their help <a id="l15695"></a>routed the army of the Medes &amp; slew Arphaxad;  &amp; Arphaxad is there said to have built Ecbatane &amp; therefore was either Dejoces or his son Praortes who might finish the City founded by Dejoces. And <a id="l15697"></a>Herodotus tells the same story of a king of Assyria who routed the <a id="l15698"></a>Medes &amp; slew their king  Phraortes, &amp; saith that in the <a id="l15699"></a>time of this war the Assyrians were left alone by the defection of the <a id="l15700"></a>auxiliary nations, being otherwise in good condition. Arphaxad was <a id="l15701"></a>therefore the Phraortes of Herodotus, &amp; by consequence was slain  neare the beginning of the reign of Iosiah. For this war was <a id="l15703"></a>made  after Phœnicia <a id="l15704"></a>Moab Ammon &amp; Egypt had been conquered &amp; revolted (Iudeth I.<a id="l15705"></a>7, 8, 9) &amp; by consequence after the reign of Asserhadon who con<a id="l15706"></a>quered them. It was made when the Iews were newly returned <a id="l15707"></a>from captivity, &amp; the vessels &amp; altar &amp; temple were sanctified <a id="l15708"></a>after the profanation (Iudeth IV.3) that is, soon after Manasseh their king <a id="l15709"></a>had been carried captive to Babylon by Asserhadon, &amp; upon the <a id="l15710"></a>death of that king or some other change in the Assyrian Empire <a id="l15711"></a>had been released with the Iews from that captivity, &amp; had re<a id="l15712"></a>paired the altar &amp; restored the sacrifices &amp; worship of the Temple <a id="l15713"></a>(2 Chron. XXXII.11, 13, 16.) In the greek version of the book of Iudeth (ch. V:18) it is said that the Temple of God was then cast to the grownd, but this is not said in Ierom's version, &amp; in  the Greek version (ch. IV.3 &amp; XVI.20)  it is said that the vessels &amp; the altar &amp; the house were then sanctified after the prophanation, &amp; in both Versions (ch. IV.11) the Temple is represented standing. </p>
<p id="par2070">After this war, Nebuchadonosor king of Assyria in the <a id="l15714"></a>13<sup>th</sup> year of his reign (according to the Version of Ierome) sent his captain Olofernes with a great <a id="l15715"></a>army to avenge himself on all the west country because they had <a id="l15716"></a>disobeyed his commandment, &amp; Olofernes went forth with an <a id="l15717"></a>army of 12000 horse &amp; 120000 foot of Assyrians Medes &amp; Per<a id="l15718"></a>sians &amp; reduced Cilicia &amp; Mesopotamia &amp; Syria &amp; Damascus &amp; part <a id="l15719"></a>of Arabia &amp; Ammon &amp; Edom &amp; Madian &amp; then came against <a id="l15720"></a>Iudæa. And this was done when the government was in the hands <a id="l15721"></a>of the High Priest &amp; Ancients of Israel (Iudeth IV.8 &amp; VII.23) &amp; by <a id="l15722"></a>consequence not in the reign of Manasses or Amon but when Iosiah was a child. In times of prosperity the <a id="l15723"></a>children of Israel were apt to go after false Gods, &amp; in times of <a id="l15724"></a>affliction to repent &amp; turn to the Lord. So Manasses a very wicked <a id="l15725"></a>king, being captivated by the Assyrians, repented, &amp; being released <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p274r"> &lt;274r&gt; </span> from captivity restored the worship of the true God. And so <a id="l15726"></a>when we are told that Iosiah in the eighth year of his reign <a id="l15727"></a>while he was yet young began to seek after the God of David <a id="l15728"></a>his father (2 Chron XXXIV.3) &amp; in the twelft year of his reign <a id="l15729"></a>began to purge Iudah &amp; Ierusalem from Idolatry &amp; to destroy <a id="l15730"></a>the High Places &amp; Groves &amp; Altars &amp; Images of Baalim, we <a id="l15731"></a>may understand that these acts of religion were occasioned <a id="l15732"></a>by impending dangers &amp; escapes from danger. When Olofernes <a id="l15733"></a>came against the western nations &amp; spoiled them, then were <a id="l15734"></a>the Iews terrified, &amp; they fortified Iudæa &amp; cried unto  <a id="l15735"></a>God with great fervency, &amp; humbled themselves in sackcloth &amp; put <a id="l15736"></a>ashes on their heads, &amp; cried unto the God of Israel that he <a id="l15737"></a>would not give their wives &amp; their children &amp; cities for a prey <a id="l15738"></a>&amp; the Temple for a profanation: &amp; the High Priest &amp; all the <a id="l15739"></a>Priests put on sackcloth &amp; ashes &amp; offered daily burnt offerings <a id="l15740"></a>with vows &amp; free gifts of the people (Iudeth IV) &amp; then <a id="l15741"></a>began Iosiah to seek after the God of his father David. And <a id="l15742"></a>after Iudeth had slain Olofernes, &amp; the Assyrians were fled <a id="l15743"></a>&amp; the Iews who pursued them were returned to Ierusalem <a id="l15744"></a>they worshipped the Lord and offered burnt offerings &amp; gifts <a id="l15745"></a>&amp; continued feasting before the sanctuary for the space <a id="l15746"></a>of <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">three</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">2</span></span> months (Iudeth XVI.18) &amp; then did Iosiah purge <a id="l15747"></a>Iudah &amp; Ierusalem from idolatry. ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 273v &gt; </span>✝ Whence it seems to me that the eighth year of Iosiah fell in with <a id="l15748"></a>the fourteenth or fifteenth of Nebuchadonosor, &amp; <sup><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>b<span class="nb-n">}</span></span></sup> that the twelft year <a id="l15749"></a>of Nebuchadonosor in which Phraortes was slain, was the 5<sup>th</sup> or6<sup>th</sup> of <a id="l15750"></a>Iosiah.

For in the book of Iudeth I do not find the Baby<a id="l15758"></a>lonians among the revolting nations.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 274r resumes &gt; </span>  <a id="l15762"></a></p>
<p id="par2071"><sup class="note" id="n282-ref">[282]</sup> Soon after the death of Phraortes, the Scythians under Madyes or <a id="l15768"></a>Medus, having invaded Media &amp; beat the Medes in battel <a id="l15769"></a>went thence towards Egypt but were met in Phœnicia by <a id="l15770"></a>Psammiticus &amp; bought off, &amp; returning reigned over a great <a id="l15771"></a>part of Asia: but in the end of about 28 years were <a id="l15772"></a>many of them slain in a feast by the Medes under the <a id="l15773"></a>conduct of Cyaxeres just before the destruction of Nineveh, <a id="l15774"></a>&amp; the rest fled I think to their brethren in Parthia.</p>
<p id="par2072">The last king of Assyria, called Saracus by Polyhistor, <a id="l15775"></a>was contemporary to Nabopolasser king of Babylon, &amp; to <a id="l15776"></a>Astyages  the successor of Phroartes in the kingdom of the Medes. For Nebuchadnezzar the son <a id="l15777"></a>of Nabopolasser married Amyite the daughter of Astyages. <a id="l15778"></a>And by this marriage the two kings having contracted affinity <a id="l15779"></a>they conspired against the Assyrians, &amp; being old, their sons Nebuchadnezzar &amp; Cyaxeres led the armies of the two <a id="l15780"></a>nations against Nineveh,  slew Saracus,  destroyed the city &amp; shared <a id="l15782"></a>the kingdom of the Assyrians. This victory the Iews refer <a id="l15783"></a>to the Chaldeans, the Greeks to the Medes, Tobit, Polyhistor <a id="l15784"></a>Iosephus &amp; Ctesias to both. It gave a beginning to the <a id="l15785"></a>great successes of Nebuchadnezzar &amp; Cyaxeres, &amp; laid the <a id="l15786"></a>foundation of the two collateral Empires of the Babylonians <a id="l15787"></a>&amp; Medes, these being branches of the Assyrian Empire. And <a id="l15788"></a>thence the time of the fall of the Assyrian Empire is deter<a id="l15789"></a>mined, the conquerors being then in their youth. In the reign of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p275r"> &lt;275r&gt; </span> Iosiah when Zephany prophesied, Nineveh &amp; the kingdom <a id="l15790"></a>of Assyria were standing, &amp; their fall was predicted <a id="l15791"></a>by that Prophet (Zeph. I.1 &amp; II.13) &amp; in the end of his <a id="l15792"></a>reign Pharaoh Nechoh king of Egypt the successor of <a id="l15793"></a>Psammiticus went up against the king of Assyria to the <a id="l15794"></a>river Euphrates to fight against Carchemish or Circutium, <a id="l15795"></a>&amp; in his way thither slew Iosiah (2 King XXIII.29. <a id="l15796"></a>2 Chron. XXXV.20.) &amp; therefore the last king of Assyria was not yet slain. But in the third &amp; fourth year of <a id="l15797"></a>Iehojakim the successor of Iosiah, the two conquerors <a id="l15798"></a>having taken Nineveh &amp; finished their war in Assyria <a id="l15799"></a>prosecuted the conquest westward &amp; leading their forces <a id="l15800"></a>against the king of Egypt as an invader of their right <a id="l15801"></a>of conquest, they beat him at Carchemish &amp; took from him <a id="l15802"></a>what ever he had newly taken from the Assyrians, <a id="l15803"></a>(2 King. XXIV.7. Ier. XLVI.2. Eupolemus apud  Euseb. <a id="l15804"></a>Præp. l. 9. c. 39) &amp; therefore we cannot err above a year <a id="l15805"></a>or two if we refer the destruction of Nineveh &amp; fall of <a id="l15806"></a>the Asyrian Empire to the second year of Iehojakim <a id="l15807"></a>Anno Nabonass. 140.</p>
<p id="par2073">Wile the Assyrians reigned at Nineveh Persia <a id="l15808"></a>was divided into several kingdoms. And amongst others <a id="l15809"></a>there was a kingdom of Elam which flourished in the <a id="l15810"></a>days of Hezekiah, Manasses, Iosiah &amp; Iehojakim kings <a id="l15811"></a>of Iudah &amp; fell in the days of Zedekiah (Ier XXV.25 <a id="l15812"></a>&amp;  XLIX.34. &amp; Ezek.

This kingdom seems to <a id="l15813"></a>have been potent, &amp; to have had wars with the kings of <a id="l15814"></a>Touran or Scythia beyond the river Oxus with various <a id="l15815"></a>success, &amp; at length to have been subdued by the Medes &amp; Babylonians, or some of them. <a id="l15816"></a>ffor while Nebuchadnezzar warred in the west Cyaxeres <a id="l15817"></a>recovered the Assyrian Provinces of Armenia Pontus &amp; Cappadocia &amp; then they went eastward against the Provinces of Persia &amp; Parthia.
