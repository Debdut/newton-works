On these accounts <a id="l9"></a>the Officers of the Mint (M<sup>r</sup> Neale, M<sup>r</sup> Hall mentioned <a id="l10"></a>in the Petition &amp; my self) then recommended him earn<a id="l11"></a>estly to the Lords Commissioners of his Majesties Treasury <a id="l12"></a>as a very fit person to execute the Office of Comp<a id="l13"></a>troller under the two late Comptrollers in that time <a id="l14"></a>of great business, and when the Comptrollers in that time <a id="l15"></a>of great business and when the Comptrollers insisted <a id="l16"></a>on M<sup>r</sup> Beresford a stranger.

After the recoynage <a id="l19"></a>of the hammered money was ended M<sup>r</sup> Haynes was <a id="l20"></a>imployed  in the Excise Office by M<sup>r</sup> Hall <a id="l21"></a>above mentioned who is able to give a further character <a id="l22"></a>of his abilities &amp; behaviour in both Offices.

    <p id="par8">Vpon your Lordships Reference of the 7<sup>th</sup> of August last concerning <a id="l30"></a>the qualifications of the Petitioners for the Weigher &amp; Teller's place <a id="l31"></a> I humbly conceive it not remote  from our  business as Officers of the Mint to give your Lordships what <a id="l32"></a>light we can into the matter by laying before your Lordships faithfully &amp; <a id="l33"></a>according to the best of our knowledge or information the qualifications &amp; services <a id="l34"></a>of the Petitioners in Mint affairs: in which respect one of them at least deserves <a id="l35"></a>in  justice a particular character. M<sup>r</sup> Haynes has been in <a id="l36"></a>the Mint about 14 yeares except two short intermissions &amp; while <a id="l37"></a>he acted there had a general reputation amongst us for integrity, <a id="l38"></a>sobriety good humour &amp; readiness in business. He has a steady hand, <a id="l39"></a>writes very fairly, is a very good Accomptant &amp;skilled in all the <a id="l40"></a>business of the Mint, &amp; in the Recoynage instructed the Officers and <a id="l41"></a>Clerks of the five country Mints, &amp; did other great service. For <a id="l42"></a>these reasons the Officers of the Mint (M<sup>r</sup> Neale M<sup>r</sup> Hall &amp; my self) <a id="l43"></a>then recommended him earnestly to the Lords Commissioners of his Majesties <a id="l44"></a>Treasury as a fit person to execute the Office of Comptroller under the <a id="l45"></a>two late Comptrollers in that time of great business, &amp; when the Comp<a id="l46"></a>trollers insisted on M<sup>r</sup> Berisford a stranger, M<sup>r</sup> Haynes was appointed <a id="l47"></a>to take care of the Comptrollers business till M<sup>r</sup> Berisford could <a id="l48"></a>qualify himself. Since the Recoynage M<sup>r</sup> Haynes has been imployed <a id="l49"></a>in the Excise Office about two years by M<sup>r</sup> Hall above mentioned who <a id="l50"></a>is able to give a further character of his abilities &amp; behaviour in <a id="l51"></a>both Offices. Yet M<sup>r</sup> Neale in  recompence of his services <a id="l52"></a>&amp; of his examining &amp; setling the Accompts of the five country Mints <a id="l53"></a>continued him his Clerk with a salary of 100<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> per annum duly paid till <a id="l54"></a>his death December 99: which salary being now ceased M<sup>r</sup> Haynes <a id="l55"></a>has nothing remaining  in lieu of a setled business <a id="l56"></a>which as he represents was of more profit &amp; which at the instance of <a id="l57"></a>some of the principal Officers of the Mint he quitted to serve the <a id="l58"></a>Publick in the Recoynage in hopes of being further considered <a id="l59"></a>when there should be an opportunity, so that at present he accounts himself  <a id="l60"></a>a loser by that service <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>and<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> his Clerk's place  in the Excise Office should be recconed into the bargain.

    back, as he has been once already when we could not be without him, <a id="l62"></a>he may be so engaged in other business that we cannot have him <a id="l63"></a>when we may want him. If any of the principal Officers or their <a id="l64"></a>Clerks or Deputies should at any time dye or leave the Mint, M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l65"></a>Haynes is qualified to assist till the place can be supplied anew that <a id="l66"></a>the business of the Mint receive no stop, &amp; upon any extraordinary <a id="l67"></a>occasion to help in our accompts or other business of the Office of <a id="l68"></a>Receipt: For we want men of skill.

    <p id="par31"><span class="large">V</span>pon your Lordships Reference of the 7<sup>th</sup> of August last <a id="l190"></a>concerning the qualifications of the Petitioners for the Weigher &amp; Tellers <a id="l191"></a>place I humbly conceive it  not remove from  our business as Officers of the Mint to give <a id="l193"></a>your Lordships what light we can into the matter by laying before your Lordships <a id="l194"></a>faithfully &amp; according to the best of our knowledge or information the <a id="l195"></a>qualifications &amp; services of the Petitioners in Mint affairs: in which <a id="l196"></a>respect one of them at least  deserves in justice a particular cha<a id="l197"></a>racter. M<sup>r</sup> Haynes has been in the Mint about fourteen years except <a id="l198"></a>two short intermissions &amp; while he acted there had a general reputati<a id="l199"></a>on amongst us for integrity sobriety good humour &amp; readiness in <a id="l200"></a>business. He has a steady hand, writes very fairly, is a very good <a id="l201"></a>Accomptant &amp; skilled in all the business of the Mint, and in the <a id="l202"></a>Recoynage, instructed the Officers &amp; Clerks of the five Country Mints <a id="l203"></a>and did other great service. For these reasons the Officers of the <a id="l204"></a>Mint (M<sup>r</sup> Neale, M<sup>r</sup> Hall &amp; my self) then recommended him <a id="l205"></a>earnestly to the Lords Commissioners of his Majesties Treasury as a fit <a id="l206"></a>person to execute the Office of Comptroller under the two late <a id="l207"></a>Comptrollers in that time of great buisiness &amp; when the Comptrollers <a id="l208"></a>insisted on M<sup>r</sup> Berisford a stranger. M<sup>r</sup> Haynes was appointed to <a id="l209"></a>take care of the Comptroller's business till M<sup>r</sup> Berisford could qualify <a id="l210"></a>himself. Since the Recoynage M<sup>r</sup> Haynes has been imployed in <a id="l211"></a>the Excise Office about two years by M<sup>r</sup> Hall above mentioned <a id="l212"></a>who is able to give a further character of his abilities &amp; behaviour <a id="l213"></a>in both Offices. Yet M<sup>r</sup> Neale in recompence of his services &amp; <a id="l214"></a>of his examining &amp; setling the Accompts fo the five Country Mints <a id="l215"></a>continued him his Clerk with a salary of 100<sup><span class="overline">li</span></sup> per annum duely paid <a id="l216"></a>till his death December 99: which salary being now ceased <a id="l217"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Haynes has nothing remaining in lieu of a setled business <a id="l218"></a>which as he represents was of more profit &amp; which at the instance <a id="l219"></a>of some of the principall Officers of the Mint he quitted to <a id="l220"></a>serve the public in the Recoynage in hopes of being further

        considered when there should be an opportunity; so that at present <a id="l221"></a>he accounts himself a loser by that service, even tho his Clerk's place <a id="l222"></a>in the Excise Office should be recconed into the bargain. By reason <a id="l223"></a>of his abilities I have ever since wished for him back into the Mint <a id="l224"></a>and if he be not now brought back as he has been once already when <a id="l225"></a>we could not be without him, he may be so ingaged in other busi<a id="l226"></a>ness that we cannot have him when we may want him. If any <a id="l227"></a>of the principal Officers or their Clerks or Deputies should at any <a id="l228"></a>time dye or leave the Mint, M<sup>r</sup> Haynes is qualified to assist till <a id="l229"></a>the place can be supplied anew that the business of the Mint <a id="l230"></a>receive no stop, &amp; upon any extraordinary occasion to help in <a id="l231"></a>our Accompts or other business of the Office of Receipt: for <a id="l232"></a>we want men of skill. I came to the Mint a stranger to him <a id="l233"></a>&amp; exact weighing, the credit of the Mint &amp; good dispatch of <a id="l234"></a>business is my interest.</p>
