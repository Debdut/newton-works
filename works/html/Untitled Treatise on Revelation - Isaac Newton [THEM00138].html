<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">PROP. I. <a id="l1"></a><br>The Seales &amp; within the seventh Seale <a id="l2"></a>the Trumpets are distributions of <a id="l3"></a>time which succeed one another orderly <a id="l4"></a>without any interruption or interfering.</h2>
<p id="par1">This Proposition follows from the <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Rule because <a id="l5"></a>in the vision as it appeared to Saint Iohn the seales were <a id="l6"></a>opened &amp; the Trumpets sounded one after another in <a id="l7"></a>order &amp; the contents of every seale &amp; Trumpet are in this book de<a id="l8"></a>scribed in the same order without any interfering or  interruption. And farther as an indication of the<a id="l10"></a> <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002"> &lt;2&gt; </span> <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> immediate consequences of opening that seale. ffor <a id="l11"></a>as soon as it is opened the Trumpets are given to the se<a id="l12"></a>ven Angels in order to their sounding.</p>
<p id="par2">I said that the Seales &amp; Trumpets are described after one <a id="l13"></a>another without any real interruption: but this is to be un<a id="l14"></a>derstood with this limitation that the seventh chapter be <a id="l15"></a>esteemed as a Parenthesis between the sixt &amp; seventh Seal; <a id="l16"></a>&amp; the tenth chapter   &amp; 13 first verses of the Eleventh also <a id="l17"></a>a Parenthesis between the sixt &amp; seventh Trumpet. ffor <a id="l18"></a>these were inserted into the continued narration of the Seals <a id="l19"></a>&amp; Trumpets for a singular reason to be explained <a id="l20"></a>hereafter, &amp;  make no more then a verball interruption <a id="l21"></a>of their continuity.  For it is manifest that the things de<a id="l25"></a>clared from ch 10.1 to ch 11.13  end together with the sixt <a id="l26"></a>Trumpet  becaus at the end of them is added: The <a id="l27"></a>second <em class="underline">wo</em> is past &amp; behold the third wo cometh quickly. <a id="l28"></a>And so the  seventh seale manifestly begins together with those things described in the seventh chapter becaus the hurting of the Earth <a id="l30"></a>&amp; the Sea &amp; the Trees which was immediately to follow <a id="l31"></a>the sealing of the saints ch 7.3 was put in execution at the <a id="l32"></a>sounding of the Trumpets; the Earth &amp; the Trees being <a id="l33"></a>hurt in the first Trumpet &amp; the Sea in the second:  &amp; <a id="l34"></a>therefore the sealing of the saints must immediately precede <a id="l35"></a>the first Trumpet &amp; so be coincident with the time of in<a id="l36"></a>cense. And indeed the stilness of the winds during the sealing, <a id="l37"></a>&amp; the silence in heaven during the incense, what els <a id="l38"></a>should they signify by their mutuall resemblance but <a id="l39"></a>the coincidence of these times? For by the silence is to be <a id="l40"></a>understood a suspension of those noises which followed the time <a id="l41"></a>of incense, that is of the voices &amp; thundrings &amp; Trumpets <a id="l42"></a>which is as much as to say a suspension of wars (see Prop 4) &amp; <a id="l43"></a>the stillnes of the winds <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>signify<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the same thing Def 52.

<h2 id="hd3" class="cent">PROP IV. <a id="l50"></a><br>The Calamities which follow upon sounding the <a id="l51"></a>Trumpets, are all by War.</h2>
<p id="par5">This the very soundings of the Trumpets imply, as being so <a id="l52"></a>many Alarms to war. But I shall run over the particulars.</p>
<p id="par6">At the first Trumpet the  <em class="underline">Blood</em> mingled with the <a id="l53"></a>Hail &amp; Fire, at the second Vial the sea becoming <em class="underline">blood</em> as of a dead <a id="l54"></a>man &amp; every thing dying in it, &amp; at the third Vial the <a id="l55"></a>ffountains becoming <em class="underline">blood</em> &amp; god's giving them <em class="underline">blood</em> to drink <a id="l56"></a>because they had shed the blood of his saints, are  manifest <a id="l57"></a>indications of war. For none of this bloodshed can be by <a id="l58"></a>persecution of the saints becaus these plagues are termed the <a id="l59"></a>Vials of the <em class="underline">wrath</em> of God &amp; so to be inflicted upon evill <a id="l60"></a>men, as is also exprest in the pouring out of the first &amp; <a id="l61"></a>third.</p>
<p id="par7"> Also at the fourth Trumpet or Vial the smiting of the Sun <a id="l62"></a>Moon &amp; stars, signifies the overthrow of some King or King<a id="l63"></a>dom by Def 44 &amp; 45, &amp; so implies war.</p>
<p id="par8">And in all these four Trumpets there is also an <a id="l64"></a>impression of war by fire &amp; burning. In the first there <a id="l65"></a>is <em class="underline">fire</em> mixed with the hail &amp; blood, in the second a moun<a id="l66"></a>tain <em class="underline">burning with fire</em>, in the third a Star <em class="underline">burning <a id="l67"></a>as it were a Lamp</em>, &amp; in the fourth power is given to <a id="l68"></a>the sun to <em class="underline">scorch men with fire</em>: &amp; this figure of <a id="l69"></a>fire &amp; burning signifies war by Def 48 &amp; 49</p>
<p id="par9">The wars of these four trumpets are also signifi<a id="l70"></a>ed by the four winds in chap 7.1, of which we shall have <a id="l71"></a>occasion to speak in Prop 15.</p>
<p id="par10">Moreover at the fift Trumpet there arose Locusts <a id="l72"></a>like horses prepared to <em class="underline">battel</em> with faces like men (i.e <a id="l73"></a>Horsmen) &amp; <em class="underline">Breastplates</em> as of Iron. And the sound of <a id="l74"></a>their wings was as of Chariots &amp; Horses running to <a id="l75"></a><em class="underline">Battel</em>.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p005"> &lt;5&gt; </span>
<p id="par11">At the sixt there were let loos four Kings with an Army <a id="l76"></a>of horsmen with Breastplates &amp; license to kill men.</p>
<p id="par12">And at the seventh the Beast with the Kings of the Earth <a id="l77"></a>were gathered together against him that sate on the hors <a id="l78"></a>&amp; against his Army.  And there followed a great Hail with thundrings &amp; lightnings &amp; a great shaking:  which are <a id="l79"></a>the singular impressions of a great Battel by Def 51 &amp; 53</p>

<h2 id="hd5" class="cent">PROP. III. <a id="l277"></a><br>The seven Thunders also  (ch. 10.3) most <a id="l278"></a>probably denote the same thing with the <a id="l279"></a>seven Trumpets.</h2>
<p id="par24">That they are not a series of things conteined in the <a id="l280"></a>sixt Trumpet is probable, as well because they are omitted <a id="l281"></a>in the sixt Vial, as becaus the little book &amp; other circum<a id="l282"></a>stances of the tenth chapter denote a regress of Prophesy. <a id="l283"></a>And if there be a regress, then there is no Epocha so <a id="l284"></a>proper for them as that of the Trumpets: especially if <a id="l285"></a>it be considered, that, as the Censer is a Type of the <a id="l286"></a>Vials of wrath, so the ensuing voices &amp; thunderings (ch 8.5) <a id="l287"></a>may be a type of the voices of these seven thunders.</p>
<p id="par25">And perhaps the reason why the things which the thun<a id="l288"></a>ders uttered are not declared, is because they are sufficiently <a id="l289"></a>declared in the Trumpets &amp; Vials. And that these Thunders <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012"> &lt;12&gt; </span> are notwithstanding introduced may probably be to make <a id="l290"></a>the description of the Beast harmonize with his number <a id="l291"></a>666. For 'tis not probable that they should be introduced <a id="l292"></a>for no end, &amp; I cannot yet see any unless to make up <a id="l293"></a>this harmony, which consists in the tripple repetition of his <a id="l294"></a>description by the Trumpets Vials &amp; Thunders, under <a id="l295"></a>the first six of which his reign is comprehended.</p>

<h2 id="hd6" class="cent">PROP.  V <a id="l296"></a><br>The fals Prophet mentioned in chap 16 <a id="l297"></a>&amp; 19, is the same with the two horned <a id="l298"></a>Beast in chap 13.</h2>
<p id="par26">This is evident by the agreement of their descriptions. ffor <a id="l299"></a>ch 13.14, the two horned Beast is said to <em class="underline">deceive</em> them that <a id="l300"></a>dwell on the earth by means of the <em class="underline">miracles</em> which he had <a id="l301"></a>power to do in the <em class="underline">sight of the beast</em>, saying that they <a id="l302"></a>should make an <em class="underline">Image</em> to the Beast which had the wound <a id="l303"></a>by a sword &amp; did live. And ch 19.20, the fals Prophet <a id="l304"></a>is said to have wrought <em class="underline">miracles before the Beast</em>, with <a id="l305"></a>which he <em class="underline">deceived</em> them that – worshipped his <em class="underline">Image</em>. Which <a id="l306"></a>descriptions sufficiently convince their sameness.</p>
<p id="par27">But further, as in ch 12 &amp; 13 the two horned Beast <a id="l307"></a>is described together with the Dragon &amp; ten horned Beast, <a id="l308"></a>so ch 16.13, instead of the two horned Beast, the fals <a id="l309"></a>Prophet is recconed with the Dragon &amp; ten horned Beast. <a id="l310"></a>Which argues it to be but another name of the same <a id="l311"></a>thing given upon the account of its lying wonders, to <a id="l312"></a>distinguish it from the ten horned Beast which in the <a id="l313"></a>14<sup>th</sup> &amp; following chapters is eminently stiled the Beast. <a id="l314"></a>And hence it appeares why Saint Iohn never speaks of <a id="l315"></a>Beasts in the plural number, as in some places he should <a id="l316"></a>have done had not one of the Beasts been signified <a id="l317"></a>by the name of the fals Prophet.</p>

<p id="par32">To make this appear I shall lay down the follwing par<a id="l427"></a>ticulars. 1 That the Dragon &amp;  Beast represent <a id="l428"></a>Kingdoms  For besides that this is their usuall signification <a id="l431"></a>in Dreames &amp; Visions Def 31 &amp; 32; the Dragon is said to have <a id="l432"></a>seven crowns upon his heads ch 12.3 &amp; to give his power <a id="l433"></a>&amp; seat &amp; great authority to the Beast ch 13.2; And the <a id="l434"></a>Beast to have power over all Kindreds &amp; Tongues &amp; Nations <a id="l435"></a>ch 13.7, &amp; with the Kings of the Earth &amp; their armies to <a id="l436"></a>make war against him that sate on the hors &amp; against his <a id="l437"></a>army ch 19.19, &amp; to have 10 crowns upon his horns ch 13.1 <a id="l438"></a>&amp; his heads &amp; horns to be  Kings ch 17.10, 12. All which <a id="l439"></a>circumstances are sufficient indications of their being  King<a id="l440"></a>doms.</p>

<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; insertion from the right margin &gt; </span>
<p id="par34">2. The Beast is a kingdom derived out of the Dragon &amp; coextended to the latter part of him. For the Dragon gave power to the Beast ch 13.2. He gave him his power &amp; his seat &amp; great authority.</p>
<p id="par35">2. But yet the Dragon did not give <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019"> &lt;19&gt; </span> cease himself: for the Beast &amp; Dragon are worshipped together ch. 13.4 &amp; coexist at their <a id="l451"></a>latter end ch 16.13. And in ch 17.11 the Beast is recconned the eigth King &amp; of the seven <a id="l452"></a>that is of the seven Kings or Heads of the Dragon, &amp; therefore not after them all so as <a id="l453"></a>to be a quite different head, but coincident with the last.</p>
<p id="par36">3 The Beast is coextended – – –<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from p 18 resumes &gt; </span> 3. The Beast is coextended to all the Trumpets. For at <a id="l454"></a>the pouring out of the first Vial there fell a grievous sore <a id="l455"></a>upon them that had the mark of the Beast; &amp; therefore he was <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020"> &lt;20&gt; </span>flicted. ffor we have shown that the Beast is overthrown <a id="l456"></a>at the beginning of the <em class="underline">seventh</em> Trumpet or Vial. And <a id="l457"></a>at the pouring out of the <em class="underline">first</em> Vial, there fell a <a id="l458"></a>grievous sore upon them that had the mark of the Beast <a id="l459"></a>&amp; worshipped his Image. And so the wo of the fift Trum<a id="l460"></a>pet is inflicted on the men that have not the seale of <a id="l461"></a>God in their foreheads ch 9.4. Who those are will appear <a id="l462"></a>by comparing it with the fift Vial which is said to be <a id="l463"></a>poured out upon the seat of the <em class="underline">Beast</em>. So that all men <a id="l464"></a>which have not the seale of God in their foreheads, that <a id="l465"></a>is all those for whose wickedness &amp; on whome God in<a id="l466"></a>flicts the punishments of these trumpets, are recconed <a id="l467"></a>for members of the Beast.</p>
<p id="par37">4. The Dragon is that part of the Kingdom whose symp<a id="l468"></a>tomes are described at the opening of the seales. ffor since the <a id="l469"></a>Beast was in being at the first Vial, the Dragon which preced<a id="l470"></a>ed him must also precede the Vials &amp; syncronise with the seales <a id="l471"></a>&amp; so be that part of the Kingdom whose Kings &amp; other symp<a id="l472"></a>tomes are described at their opening.</p>
<p id="par38">5. The common period of the  Dragon &amp; Beast <a id="l473"></a>is coincident with the common period of the Seales &amp; Trumpets. <a id="l474"></a>I think this is reasonable because the parts of the Prophesy will <a id="l475"></a>thereby best agree with one another. ffor as of the whole series <a id="l476"></a>of Prophesy exhibited by the seales &amp; Trumpets, the most <a id="l477"></a>eminent distribution is into two parts, the Seales &amp; the Trum<a id="l478"></a>pets; &amp; of the series of Prophesy exhibited by the Dragon &amp; <a id="l479"></a>Beast, the most eminent distribution is also into two parts, the <a id="l480"></a>Dragon &amp; Beast: so the most eminent distribution of the <a id="l481"></a>subjects of those prophesies must be into two parts or un<a id="l482"></a>like successions of things answering to the parts of the <a id="l483"></a>prophesies. And therefore since both Prophesies relate <a id="l484"></a>to one common subject or kingdom as was newly shown, <a id="l485"></a>their parts by agreeing to the same parts of that  kingdom must synchronise with one another.</p>
<p id="par39">** <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from p 22 &gt; </span>** The next action is the persecution of the Woman by the Dragon, &amp; <a id="l487"></a>her flight into the wilderness, &amp; this must begin with the next seale. <a id="l488"></a>If it begin sooner it will interfere with the Sixt seale <a id="l489"></a>wherewith it is utterly inconsistent. ffor during that seale, the <a id="l490"></a>Church is represented in  a victorious &amp; triumphant <a id="l491"></a>state,  over the Dragon. And <a id="l492"></a>she cannot be at the same time both triumphant over her <a id="l493"></a>enemies &amp;  persecuted by them so as to fly into the Wilderness <a id="l494"></a>It cannot begin therefore sooner then the seventh seale, &amp; <a id="l495"></a>there is no  room for it to begin later becaus the Beast is <a id="l496"></a>in being at the first  Vial ch 16.2. &amp; consequently <a id="l497"></a>at the first Trumpet, &amp; his rise is later then the beginning <a id="l498"></a>of this Persecution. Wherefore it must begin with the se<a id="l499"></a>venth seale. And with the contents of that it suits most <a id="l500"></a>punctually. For the prayers of the saints offered up to God, <a id="l501"></a>&amp; the contemporary sealing of the servants of God (Prop 17) &amp; <a id="l502"></a>the commission of the four Angels to hurt the earth &amp; the Sea <a id="l503"></a>so sooon as they were sealed, are all arguments of evil <a id="l504"></a>times then beginning, wherein the saints are oppressed, &amp; <a id="l505"></a>Gods judgments shortly to ensue upon their enemies for <a id="l506"></a>oppressing them. And this alone  might be enough to manifest that <a id="l507"></a>the triumph of the Church ends with the sixt seale &amp; conse<a id="l508"></a>quently that the persecution of the Dragon begins with the <a id="l509"></a>seventh.</p>
<p id="par40">Wherefore since the Beast was in being at the first Trumpet <a id="l510"></a>&amp; the Dragon persecuted the Woman  in the space between <a id="l511"></a>that &amp; the beginning of the seventh seale it remains that their com<a id="l512"></a>mon period be coincident with the common period of the seales &amp; Trum<a id="l513"></a>pets: I mean the period of the Dragon so far as he precedes the Beast <a id="l514"></a>&amp; of the seales so far as they precede the Trumpets. For the Trum<a id="l515"></a>pets are conteined within the seventh seale, &amp; the Dragon does not wholly <a id="l516"></a>perish at the rise of the Beast, but becomes a member of him as shall <a id="l517"></a>be shewed hereafter.</p>
<p id="par41">I suppose it will not now be doubted whither the Dragon be <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023"> &lt;23&gt; </span> then in being; that is, at the time of the first Trumpet. <a id="l518"></a>And I have shown above that he is overthrown at the sounding <a id="l519"></a>of the seventh Trumpet. See the 5<sup>t</sup> particular following.</p>
<p id="par42">4 The Dragon is coextended to all the seales. For the <a id="l520"></a>latter part of him because coincident with the Beast must fall <a id="l521"></a>in with the Trumpets &amp; consequently with the seventh seale. And <a id="l522"></a>therefore the former part of him which precedes the Beast must <a id="l523"></a>also precede that Seale &amp; so fall in with the other six</p>
<p id="par43">But for fuller manifestation of this particular, &amp; that it may <a id="l524"></a>appear how the Dragon is that Kingdom whose symptomes are <a id="l525"></a>described in the seales, it will not be amiss to compare <a id="l526"></a>particularly the Prophesy of the Dragon with the contents of <a id="l527"></a>the seales.</p>
<p id="par44">And first concerning the war which the Dragon made with <a id="l528"></a>Michael &amp; his Angels it is said that they overcame him by <a id="l529"></a>the blood of the Lamb, &amp; by the word of their testimony, &amp; they loved not their lives unto the death ch 12.11. Whereby <a id="l530"></a>it appears that the Angels or souldiers that warred with him were <a id="l531"></a>the saints, &amp; their weapons the blood of the Lamb &amp; word of <a id="l532"></a>their testimony, &amp; their courage that they loved not their lives <a id="l533"></a>unto the death, or that they exposed their lives freely for <a id="l534"></a>the sake of the gospel. And so this war was managed on the <a id="l535"></a>saints part by testifying the truth of the gospell, &amp; on the Dra<a id="l536"></a>gons part by persecuting &amp; killing them for their testimony: <a id="l537"></a>whence he is called the accuser of the brethren which accused <a id="l538"></a>them before God day &amp; night vers 10. And that this was no <a id="l539"></a>slight skirmish but a very earnest conflict is further exprest <a id="l540"></a>by the emphaticall repetition that Michael &amp; his angels fought <a id="l541"></a>against the Dragon, &amp; the Dragon fought &amp; his Angels. Now <a id="l542"></a>if we take a view of the seales to see where this persecution <a id="l543"></a>is described, we shall not find it before the fift seale, but <a id="l544"></a>there it is exprest most lively by the soules under the Altar <a id="l545"></a>of them that were slain for the word of God &amp; for the <em class="underline">testi<a id="l546"></a>mony</em> which they held, who cryed with a loud voice saying: How <a id="l547"></a>long, O Lord, holy &amp; true dost thou not judg &amp; avenge our <a id="l548"></a>blood on them that dwell on the earth &amp;c.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from p 20 resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par45"> And first concerning the war which the Dragon made <a id="l551"></a>with Michael &amp; his angels, it is said that they overcame him <a id="l552"></a>by the blood of the Lamb, &amp; by the word of their testimony <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021"> &lt;21&gt; </span> &amp; they loved not their lives unto the death, ch 12.11. Where<a id="l553"></a>by it appeares that the Angels or souldiers that warred <a id="l554"></a>with him were the saints, &amp; their weapons the blood of <a id="l555"></a>the Lamb &amp; word of their testimony, &amp; their courage that <a id="l556"></a>they loved not their lives unto the death, or that they ex<a id="l557"></a>posed their lives freely for the sake of the Gospel. And <a id="l558"></a>so this war was managed on the saints' part by testifying <a id="l559"></a>the truth of the Gospel, &amp; on the Dragon's part by persecut<a id="l560"></a>ing &amp; killing them for their testimony: whence he is <a id="l561"></a>called the accuser of the Brethren which accused them before <a id="l562"></a>God day &amp; night vers 10.

Now if we take a view of the seales to <a id="l567"></a>see where this persecution is described, wee shal not find <a id="l568"></a>it before the fift seale, but there it is exprest most <a id="l569"></a>lively by the soules under the Altar of them that were <a id="l570"></a>slain for the word of God &amp; for the <em class="underline">testimony</em> which they <a id="l571"></a>held, who cryed with a loud voice saying how long o <a id="l572"></a>Lord holy &amp; true dost thou not judg &amp; avenge our <a id="l573"></a>blood on them that dwel on the earth, &amp;c And in the <a id="l574"></a>next  seale we have the event of this war as lively <a id="l575"></a>described by the smiting of the luminaries &amp; powers <a id="l576"></a>of heaven &amp; earth. ffor heaven in visions represents <a id="l577"></a>the throne or court of a King or other supreme Au<a id="l578"></a>thority, the clouds his splendor &amp; glory, the earth the inferior <a id="l579"></a>sort of people, the starrs the nobles, the Sun the supreme <a id="l580"></a>authority &amp; the Moon the next in dignity. Thus in Ioseph's <a id="l581"></a>dreame the sun moon &amp; stars signify his Father Mother <a id="l582"></a>&amp; Brethren. And accordingly the  Earthquake &amp; smit<a id="l583"></a>ing of the Sun Moon Stars &amp; heaven at the opening of the <a id="l584"></a>sixt seale will signify the terror of the people &amp; overthrow<a id="l585"></a>ing  or subduing of that Kingdom which the Prophe<a id="l586"></a>sy relates to. Which interpretation is not onely agreable to the use </p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p024"> &lt;24&gt; </span>
<p id="par46">The next thing is the event of the war which was that <a id="l587"></a>the Dragon &amp; his angels were not able to withstand,  <a id="l588"></a>neither was their place found any more in heaven. But the <a id="l589"></a>great Dragon was cast out that old Serpent called the Devil <a id="l590"></a>&amp; Sathan which deceived the whole world, he was cast out into <a id="l591"></a>the earth &amp; his angels were cast out with him. Now by <a id="l592"></a>this victory we are not to understand the subversion of <a id="l593"></a>any temporal dominion but a victory of Christianity over <a id="l594"></a>heathenism, as is manifest because it was obteined by the <a id="l595"></a>blood of the Lamb &amp; by testimony of his Martyrs, &amp; also be<a id="l596"></a>cause the Dragon which was cast out  is called that <a id="l597"></a>old serpent the Devil &amp; Sathan which deceiveth the whole <a id="l598"></a>world, &amp; immediately after his being cast out a voice <a id="l599"></a>was heard in heaven saying: Now is come salvation &amp; <a id="l600"></a>strength &amp; the kingdom of our God &amp; the power of his Christ <a id="l601"></a>for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused <a id="l602"></a>them before our God day &amp; night.</p>
<p id="par47">And this agrees to the next seale, where this great <a id="l603"></a>overthrow of the kingdom of Sathan is represented by <a id="l604"></a>the smiting of the Sun Moon &amp; Stars, the great shaking, <a id="l605"></a>&amp; the departure of the heavens. For these expressions uni<a id="l606"></a>versally signify the overthrow of kingdoms Def 44, 45, 51 &amp; 3 <a id="l607"></a>And least this should seem to respect the overthrow of <a id="l608"></a>any other kingdom then that of Sathan the whole <a id="l609"></a>Seale is spent in describing the ruin of Idolatry. For <a id="l610"></a>the stars of heaven falling unto the earth as figgs from a <a id="l611"></a>figg tree signify Idols falling down by Def 65 The <a id="l612"></a>Heavens departing as a scroll when it is rolled together sig<a id="l613"></a>nify the roofs &amp; glory of  their Temples cast down by Def 65 <a id="l614"></a>The moving of mountains &amp; Islands out of their places <a id="l615"></a>signify the demolishing of their Temples &amp; Altars by Def  8 &amp; 19 <a id="l616"></a>And the kings of the earth &amp; great men &amp; rich men &amp; <a id="l617"></a>chief captains &amp;  mighty men, &amp; every bond <a id="l618"></a>man &amp; every free man hiding themselves in the Dens &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025"> &lt;25&gt; </span> in the rocks of the Mountains &amp; saying to the mountains &amp; rocks <a id="l619"></a>Fall on us &amp; hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the <a id="l620"></a>throne; these signify Idols of every degree &amp; sort (whether<a id="l621"></a> they be worshipped by Kings or great men or rich men <a id="l622"></a>or  captains or mighty men or bond or free) to be first hid  <a id="l623"></a>or shut up in their temples &amp; then buried in the ruins  thereof. Def 63 &amp; 64. And lastly as a <a id="l624"></a>further indication that this Seale is to be interpreted of a victory of <a id="l625"></a> christianity over the kingdom of Sathan it is added that they <a id="l626"></a>said: Hide us <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>from<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the face of *<sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup>  him that sitteth on the throne &amp; <a id="l627"></a>from the wrath of the Lamb for the great day of his wrath <a id="l628"></a>is come &amp; who shall be able to stand. Which expressions <a id="l629"></a>seem borrowed from Isa 2.21 where in like manner speak<a id="l630"></a>ing of Idols, he saith that they shall cast them to the Moles <a id="l631"></a>&amp; to the Bats to go into the clefts of the rocks &amp; into the <a id="l632"></a>holes of the ragged rocks for <em class="underline">fear of the Lord</em> &amp; for the <a id="l633"></a>glory of his Majesty when he arriseth to shake terribly <a id="l634"></a>the earth.</p>
<p id="par48">But that the analogy between the contents of this Seale &amp; <a id="l635"></a>the overthrow of the Kingdom of the Dragon may appear more <a id="l636"></a>fully: let the Dragon be compared to the sun which became <a id="l637"></a>black as sackcloth of hair Def 2 &amp; his angels which toge<a id="l638"></a>ther with him were cast out of heaven into the earth, to the <a id="l639"></a>stars which fell from heaven to the earth as figgs from a <a id="l640"></a>figtree Def 2 <span class="hspac-n" title="4 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; their being cast  ἐις την γην into the earth, to the hiding of men in Dens &amp; Rocks of mountains &amp; saying <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>to the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Mountains &amp; <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>to the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Rocks fall on <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>us<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; the Heathen Church (if I may so call <a id="l641"></a>the zelous worshippers &amp; defenders of Idolatry) to the <a id="l642"></a>Moon which became as blood Def 45 ffor the Dragon &amp; <a id="l643"></a>his Church are related to one another as the church of christ <a id="l644"></a>to Christ that is as a woman to her husband, &amp; so may <a id="l645"></a>be signified by the Sun &amp; Moon like Iacob &amp; Rachel. Gen <a id="l646"></a>37.10.</p>
<p id="par49">The next action is the persecution of the woman by the <a id="l647"></a>Dragon &amp; her flight into the Wilderness. And this must begin with <a id="l648"></a>the next seale. ffor it cannot begin sooner because the sixt seale <a id="l649"></a>is wholly taken up in casting down the Dragon &amp; it begins not till <a id="l650"></a>after his casting down is fully accomplished ch 12.13. Nor can it <a id="l651"></a> begin later: ffor the <em class="underline">Wo</em> which in ch 12.12 was proclaimed against <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026"> &lt;26&gt; </span> the inhabitants of the earth &amp; of the sea because the Devil was come <a id="l652"></a>down unto them to persecute the woman, began to be executed on the earth <a id="l653"></a>in the first Trumpet &amp; on the Sea in the second. And therefore since God's <a id="l654"></a>judgments follow the sins of men, the persecution of the woman which caused these judg<a id="l655"></a>ments must begin some little time at least before the Trumpets &amp; <a id="l656"></a>so fall in with the time of incence. And with that it suits most punctu<a id="l657"></a>ally: For the prayers of the saints offered up together with the incense <a id="l658"></a>to God, &amp; the contemporary sealing of the servants of God, &amp; the comissi<a id="l659"></a>on of the four Angels to hurt the earth &amp; the Sea so soon as they <a id="l660"></a>were sealed are all arguments of evill times then beginning wherein <a id="l661"></a>the saints are oppressed &amp; Gods judgments shortly to ensue upon their <a id="l662"></a>enemies for oppressing them.</p>
<p id="par50">And hence we may understand why the narration of the seales is inter<a id="l663"></a>rupted between the sixt &amp; seventh seale by the interposition of the seventh <a id="l664"></a>chapter. For the designe of such an interruption must be to signify an <a id="l665"></a>end of the former state of things &amp; the beginning of a new one by <a id="l666"></a>some grand revolution, &amp; so it will most fitly agree to that car<a id="l667"></a>dinall period of time which concluded the reign of the Dragon in heaven <a id="l668"></a>&amp; began the flight of the Woman into the wilderness. But of this more hereafter</p>
<p id="par51">The next action is that as the Woman fled into the Wilderness the <a id="l669"></a>Dragon cast out of his mouth water as a flood after her that he might cause her <a id="l670"></a>to be carried away of the flood, and the Earth helped her &amp; swallowed <a id="l671"></a>up the waters. Now for understanding this it must be considered ffirst <a id="l672"></a>that by the Earth is meant inhabitants of the Earth Def 4 namely <a id="l673"></a>of that earth which was mentioned a little before with the Sea to whome <a id="l674"></a>the Devil came down vers 12. Secondly that by the waters are meant <a id="l675"></a>multitudes of people Def 5 &amp; those inhabitants of the sea afforesaid <a id="l676"></a>ffor since they are cast out of the Dragons mouth they must be of his king<a id="l677"></a>dom &amp; consequently of the inhabitants of the earth &amp; Sea. But not of <a id="l678"></a>the earth since that swallowed up these waters &amp; besides it is inconsistent <a id="l679"></a>with the analogy of the Vision where two sorts of people are distinguisht by <a id="l680"></a>the  names of Earth &amp; sea, to represent those of the earth by water. <a id="l681"></a>These waters are therefore of the sea They are indeed compared onely to a flood  but that is in respect of their being cast out of the Dragons <a id="l682"></a>mouth  &amp; hinders not that they should be inhabi<a id="l683"></a>tants of the sea since all waters originally proceed from thence. Thirdly <a id="l684"></a>whereas the woman was persecuted by the waters, &amp; the earth helped her <a id="l685"></a>&amp; swallowed up the waters, there is opposition &amp; war signified between the <a id="l686"></a>earth &amp; waters with victory to the earth.</p>
<p id="par52">Now compare all this with the Trumpets &amp; you will find the <a id="l687"></a>Analogy very full. For by Prop 4 the Trumpets are so many sucessive <a id="l688"></a>degrees of war which break out after the short peace during the stilness of <a id="l689"></a>the winds in the time of incense, &amp; these wars falling heavy upon the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p028"> &lt;28&gt; </span> Earth in the first Trumpet &amp; upon the waters in the second <a id="l690"></a>&amp; third, the Earth &amp; Waters will therefore be the parties con<a id="l691"></a>cerned in these wars &amp; so may well be supposed the two enemies <a id="l692"></a>at war with one another whereof the earth is worsted in the first <a id="l693"></a>attempt but afterwards in the second &amp; third Trumpet prevailes <a id="l694"></a>over the waters &amp;, as it were, swallows them up in victory drying  them  up so much that although they were a sea in the <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span>.  <a id="l695"></a></p>
<p id="par53">The last action of the Dragon mentioned in this 12<sup>th</sup> chapter is that after <a id="l698"></a>this he was wrath with the woman &amp; went to make war with the <a id="l699"></a>remnant of her seed which kept the commandments of God &amp; have <a id="l700"></a>the testimony of Iesus Christ. And this being when there was left <a id="l701"></a>but a remnant of the seed of the woman, it must be understood of the times <a id="l702"></a>of greatest desolation, that is of the 42 Months when the woman <a id="l703"></a>was fully arrived into the wilderness &amp; the witnesses prophesied in <a id="l704"></a>sackcloth: which  in Prop 16 I shall show to be in the <a id="l705"></a>5<sup>t</sup> &amp; 6<sup>t</sup> Trumpets.</p>
<p id="par54">And lastly at the end of this time it is recorded of the Dragon in <a id="l706"></a>chap 16 that out of his mouth &amp; out of the mouth of the Beast &amp; of <a id="l707"></a>the fals Prophet  there went three unclean  spirits like <a id="l708"></a>ffroggs unto the kings of the earth &amp; of the whole world to gather <a id="l709"></a>them to the battel of the great day of God Almighty. And this is <a id="l710"></a>that great battel at the seventh Vial or  Trumpet at which the <a id="l711"></a>Beast &amp; fals Prophet are taken &amp; cast into the lake of fire, &amp; the Dra<a id="l712"></a>gon bound &amp; cast into the bottomless pit ch 19.20 &amp; 20.2.</p>
<p id="par55">Thus we have deduced the reign of the Dragon from the fift <a id="l713"></a>Seale to the last Trumpet. And I suppose it will not now be doubted <a id="l714"></a>whither he be also synchronall to the four first seales, since it is not <a id="l715"></a>likely that the wars &amp; other things there described (especially in the 2<sup>d</sup> <a id="l716"></a>&amp; 4<sup>th</sup> seale) should relate to any other kingdom then that which   before the battel with Michael, &amp; consequently   before the fift seale, drew <a id="l718"></a>the third part of the stars of heaven with his tayle &amp; cast them to the <a id="l719"></a>earth, that is which (by Def 2 &amp; 39) had then subdued the third part of the kings &amp; <a id="l720"></a>Princes of the world with his Armies. He is indeed represented as if he had ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from p 27 &gt; </span> ✝ had but newly done casting them down when he began that battel; but he is not introdu<a id="l721"></a>ced rising out of the earth or sea like the two Beasts, but as preexistent with the woman <a id="l722"></a>&amp; Michael: which is intimation enough that he as well as the Woman &amp; Michael was <a id="l723"></a>in being even before the writing of this  Prophesy.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from p 28 resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par56">Having run through the Analogy of the Prophesy of the Dragon to that <a id="l724"></a>of the seales &amp; Trumpets: it will not be amis to take notice of an <a id="l725"></a>objection that may arise about the signification of the Dragon, in that I <a id="l726"></a>understand it one while of a kingdom &amp; another while of that old Ser<a id="l727"></a>pent the Devil. For the circumstances do manifestly require that it be <a id="l728"></a>taken in both these significations, &amp; yet to understand it in both will be <a id="l729"></a>no inconstancy if it be done with mutuall respect to one another, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030"> &lt;30&gt; </span> that is, if it be understood indifferently either of such a Kingdom which <a id="l730"></a>doth the works of the Devil &amp; is of a religion instituted by him, <a id="l731"></a>or of the Devil &amp; his works with respect to such a Kingdom as doth <a id="l732"></a>them. For this is nothing more then when a King is sometimes <a id="l733"></a>put for the person of a king &amp; sometimes for his Kingdom; which in <a id="l734"></a>the sacred prophesies is not unusuall.</p>
<p id="par57">* <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from p 29 &gt; </span> <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> Beast is more especially the Kingdom on which the plagues of the Trumpets &amp; Vialls are <a id="l735"></a><span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> For thus much is exprest in the first Vial where there fell a grievous <a id="l736"></a>sore on the men which had the mark of the Beast &amp; worshipped his Image; &amp; in <a id="l737"></a>the fift Vial which was poured upon the seat of the beast, so that his Kingdom <a id="l738"></a>became full of darknes; &amp; in the sixt &amp; seventh Vial where there came <a id="l739"></a>out of the Mouth of the Beast &amp; Dragon &amp; fals Prophet thre unclean spirits <a id="l740"></a>to gather the world to the battel of the great day wherein the Beast perished &amp; <a id="l741"></a>Babylon (the whore which sate upon him) came in remembrance before God <a id="l742"></a>to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. Also in the <a id="l743"></a>preface to the Vials the Prophet first introduces the seven Angels having these <a id="l744"></a>seven plagues ch 15.1, &amp; then  the Victors over the Beast ver 2, 3, 4, <a id="l745"></a>&amp; then returns to the description of the Plagues: as if by thus interweaving <a id="l746"></a>them he intended to point at the Beast as the subject thereof. So in the Pre<a id="l747"></a>face to the Trumpets the Angels are forbid to hurt the earth &amp; the Sea until <a id="l748"></a>the searvants of God be sealed, as if it were to signify that those hurts were <a id="l749"></a>to be inflicted on the men which have not the seale of God in their fforeheads <a id="l750"></a>ffor so it is exprest in the fift Trumpet. And who those are you may <a id="l751"></a>learn by comparing that Trumpet with the fift Vial; namely them that <a id="l752"></a>have the mark of the Beast. In a word, the wickednes &amp; universality <a id="l753"></a>of the Kingdom of the Beast with the Dragon, which by Prop 14 is included in <a id="l754"></a>him, is so great as leaves no room for these plagues to fall beside him.</p>
<p id="par58">6. The Beast  rose —<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from p 30 resumes &gt; </span>  **   Lastly the rise of the Beast is one of the most <a id="l761"></a>cardinal revolutions in all the prophesy &amp; so can fall in with no <a id="l762"></a>time so well as with that cardinal period between the sixt &amp; seventh <a id="l763"></a> Seale where both by the beginning of the Trumpets &amp; by the <a id="l764"></a>interposition of the seventh chapter is signified an end of the former <a id="l765"></a>state of things &amp; the beginning of a new one.

<p id="par59">The Beast rose out of the Sea either at or  after the opening of the sixt <a id="l788"></a><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>seale and<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> according to the tenour &amp; order of the visions that rise must be after the war of the Dragon <a id="l789"></a><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>with<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Michael, the Dragon being  introduced but newly before &amp; in that war represented with his full power which he gave (some <a id="l790"></a>of it at least) to the Beast at his rise. This rise therefore could not be before the opening of the sixt seale. Nor could it be long after becaus</p>
<p id="par60">7. The Beast ascended out of the bottomless pit at the opening of the seventh <a id="l791"></a>seale. He had a double rise whereof the second (after a deliquium) was out of the <a id="l792"></a>bottomles pit as is manifest from hence that he is called the beast which was &amp; is <a id="l793"></a>not &amp; shall ascend out of the bottomless pit. His rise out of the Sea signifies only <a id="l794"></a><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>his<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> beginning to be a temporal kingdom, but his ascention  out of the bottomles <a id="l795"></a>pit expresses moreover his bringing up with him a fals infernall religion. Def. <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <a id="l796"></a>The first preceded his mortal wound with a sword, the second was at his reviving, <a id="l797"></a>for then or rather immediately after was set up his new religion as is plain from hence <a id="l798"></a>that when the two hornd beast caused men to set up the worshipping of him &amp; make <a id="l799"></a>an image to him, he is not called the Beast which  rose out of the sea but the beast <a id="l800"></a>whose mortal wound was healed vers 12, &amp; the wounded beast which lived or revived vers 14.</p>
<p id="par61">Now that this second rise fals in with the beginning of the seventh seal may <a id="l801"></a>appear by these reasons. 1 It could not  be much later becaus the plague of the first <a id="l802"></a>Vial was inflicted on the men which had received the mark of the beast &amp; worshipped <a id="l803"></a>his Image, &amp; therefore the Beast &amp; his Image with their religion were in being before the pouring <a id="l804"></a>out of that Vial &amp; consequently before the sounding of the first Trumpet. <a id="l805"></a>Nor could it be much sooner because it followed the deliquium of the beast which together <a id="l806"></a>with his continuance before that deliquium could not but take up some considerable <a id="l807"></a>time, &amp; both which were after the Opening of the sixt seale. It must therefore be about the opening of the 7<sup>th</sup> seale.  Secondly although <a id="l808"></a>the rising of the beast out of the sea, becaus it expresses only the rise of a temporal <a id="l809"></a>kingdom without respect to religion be not inconsistent with the things described in <a id="l810"></a>that seal, nor with those in chap 12.10 coincident to it; yet his ascention out of <a id="l811"></a>the pit implying the rise of a new infernal religion must needs so soon as that religion is grown to any considerable degree of maturity put an end <a id="l812"></a>to those things &amp; with them to that seale &amp; so begin the next.  Thirdly the <a id="l813"></a>interweaving —— <img title="Symbol (2 asterisks in a box) in text" src="/resources/images/texts/symbol.gif" alt="Symbol (2 asterisks in a box) in text"> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from p 29 &gt; </span> <img title="Symbol (2 asterisks in a box) in text" src="/resources/images/texts/symbol.gif" alt="Symbol (2 asterisks in a box) in text"> –  Thirdly the interweaving the vision of the victors over the Beast with the <a id="l814"></a>first appearance of the seven angels of the Vials ch 15.1, 2, 6, is intimation <a id="l815"></a>enough that those victors begin then to get the victory, &amp; consequently that <a id="l816"></a>the beast begins then to be. ffor it is necessary that he be adequately syn<a id="l817"></a>chronall to those that get the victory over him because there  is no cessa<a id="l818"></a>tion of the church militant. Now the first appearance of these Angels, <a id="l819"></a>according to the analogy of this vision of the Vials with that of the Trumpets, <a id="l820"></a>must be at the same time with the first appearance of the seven Angels <a id="l821"></a>of the Trumpets. That is, at the opening of the seventh Seal.  Fourthly <a id="l822"></a>by the opposite relation of the seal of God to the mark of the Beast, <a id="l823"></a>it is most naturall to suppose that the vision of sealing the saints is <a id="l824"></a><span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>but<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> a mystical indication of the time when men began to receive the <a id="l825"></a>mark of the Beast; that is, of the time when the Beast arose, which therefore <a id="l826"></a>must be immediately after the sixt seal.  Lastly the rise of the Beast —<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from p 31 resumes &gt; </span> – adjusted to one another by Rule <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p id="par62">8. Notwithstanding this the reexistence of the beast began a little before the 7<sup>th</sup> <a id="l827"></a>seale. For the time of his death by the wound preceding the setting up of his worship &amp; the making of his <a id="l828"></a>Image (chap 13.12,14) &amp; consequently not only the first Vial ch 16 but also his ascention <a id="l829"></a>out of the pit, must fall in with his other deliquium or non existence in the sixt seale, as we signi<a id="l830"></a>fied above &amp; even the resemblance of the Parables  may evince. His reex<a id="l831"></a>istence therefore begins at the healing of his wound. But his wound was <a id="l832"></a>healed before the end of the sixt seale:<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup>  for this seale, as I shall show <a id="l833"></a><span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>hereafter<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>, was the Head in which the  Beast was  wounded; &amp; therefore  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p032"> &lt;32&gt; </span> be also synchronall to the four first seales, &amp; hence it is <a id="l835"></a>not likely that the warrs &amp; other  things there described <a id="l836"></a>should relate to any other Kingdom; &amp; the Prophesy <a id="l837"></a>after the narration of the seales &amp; Trumpets beginning <a id="l838"></a>anew at the Woman &amp; Dragon ch 12, there is no reason why <a id="l839"></a>it should not return to the first Epocha.</p>
<p id="par63">Object: j. Since the Beast was immediately to succeed the <a id="l840"></a>Dragon, his reign ought to be dated from the overthrow <a id="l841"></a>of the Dragon by Michael, which overthrow may be suppo<a id="l842"></a>sed at the beginning of the sixt seale, &amp; so the Beast will <a id="l843"></a>begin his reign before the Trumpets.</p>
<p id="par64">Resp. It is not likely that the direct &amp; immediate <a id="l844"></a>effects of Michael's victory should be the setting up of the <a id="l845"></a>Beast who seems to have equald if not transcended the <a id="l846"></a>Dragon in wickedness.  This is inconsistent with the triumph of the church in the sixt seale &amp;  much more with the following actions  <a id="l848"></a>of the Dragon. For his persecuting the woman into <a id="l849"></a>the wilderness, &amp; casting out of his mouth water as a <a id="l850"></a>flood after her, do infer not onely his after-existence <a id="l851"></a>but continuance in  power, &amp; it is said afterward that <a id="l852"></a>the Dragon gave the Beast his power &amp; his seat &amp; <a id="l853"></a>great Authority which he could not have done if he had <a id="l854"></a>lost it  in the Battel with Michael. For his <a id="l855"></a>overthrow appears by the description of it to have been <a id="l856"></a>in religious &amp; spiritual rather then temporal matters <a id="l857"></a>&amp; therefore the Dragon notwithstanding might still retain <a id="l858"></a>his temporal Dominion</p>
<p id="par65">The expressions indeed that the Dragon with his an<a id="l859"></a>gels was cast out of heaven into the earth do imply his <a id="l860"></a>casting out of the throne into a vulgar state &amp; conse<a id="l861"></a>quently the ruin of his kingdom, but this as I said is to be <a id="l862"></a>understood of the spiritual state &amp; not the temporal power <a id="l863"></a>of that kingdom called the Dragon. For the fuller under<a id="l864"></a>standing of which we must know that the Dragon has here <a id="l865"></a>a double signification, representing primarily that old ser<a id="l866"></a>pent the Devil, &amp; thence by a trope the kingdom which <a id="l867"></a>does the works of the Devil &amp; is of a religion instituted <a id="l868"></a>by him. And where it is said that the Dragon was cast out <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p033"> &lt;33&gt; </span> of heaven into the Earth it is to be taken in the first sense <a id="l870"></a>for the Devil with his worship, &amp; not in the second for <a id="l871"></a>the temporal state of the Kingdom which exerciseth that wor<a id="l872"></a>ship. ffor the words are, That the great Dragon was <a id="l873"></a>cast out, that old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan, <a id="l874"></a>which deceiveth the whole world; he was cast out into <a id="l875"></a>the earth &amp; his angels were cast out with him. ch. 12.9. <a id="l876"></a>Which is as much as to say that the worship of the Devil was <a id="l877"></a>cast out of the Throne or Court, &amp; remained onely <a id="l878"></a>among the inferiour people. But where it is said that <a id="l879"></a>the Dragon had seven heads &amp; ten hornes &amp; seven crowns <a id="l880"></a>upon his heads, &amp; his tayle drew the third part of the <a id="l881"></a>stars of heaven &amp;c And that he persecuted the woman &amp; gave the Beast his <a id="l882"></a>power &amp; seat &amp; great Authority, it must be rather <a id="l883"></a>taken in the second sence for the temporary Kingdom. <a id="l884"></a>And so comparing these two senses the result will be <a id="l885"></a>that after the worship of the Dragon was cast out, the <a id="l886"></a>Kingdom denominated from thence still continued &amp; retained <a id="l887"></a>its former power &amp; name until it gave the Beast its <a id="l888"></a>power &amp; seat &amp; great Authority; [that is untill by <a id="l889"></a>reason of some further notable alteration it exchanged <a id="l890"></a>its name for that of the Beast.]</p>
<p id="par66">Nor need it seem strange that the Kingdom retained <a id="l891"></a>the name of Dragon after the Dragon was cast out, [since <a id="l892"></a>he was not thereby quite destroyed but onely cast out <a id="l893"></a>of heaven into the Earth, &amp; so stil preserved his worship <a id="l894"></a>among the vulgar. And from them the whole kingdom <a id="l895"></a>might be properly denominated, so long at least as they <a id="l896"></a>continued the major part.  And after that] For the ancient <a id="l897"></a>worship of the Dragon might  be a sufficient reason to continue <a id="l898"></a>that name to the Kingdom  to distinguish it from the Beast.</p>
<p id="par67">Object 2. Before the pouring out of the Vials Saint Iohn <a id="l900"></a>saw them that had gotten the victory over the Beast ch 15.2, <a id="l901"></a>And therefore the Beast existed before the first Vial <a id="l902"></a>&amp; consequently before the first Trumpet.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p034"> &lt;34&gt; </span>
<p id="par68">Resp. This vision of the Victors over the Beast doubtless <a id="l904"></a>respects all those that were at any time to get the victory <a id="l905"></a>over him, &amp; therefore must necessarily extend to the time <a id="l906"></a>within the Vials, becaus although the Beast should have begun <a id="l907"></a>his reign before them, yet within them was to be the great<a id="l908"></a>est part of his reign wherein those Victors were to get the <a id="l909"></a>Victory. And if it extend to the time within the vials, there <a id="l910"></a> can be no necessity of referring it to any time before them.</p>
<p id="par69">Nor need the tense exprest in the translation, <em class="underline">I saw <a id="l911"></a>them that</em> had <em class="underline">gotten the victory over the Beast</em>, breed any <a id="l912"></a>difficulty, since it may be as well translated thus. I saw them <a id="l913"></a>that get the Victory, or I saw the Victors over the Beast, <a id="l914"></a>νικωντας ἐκ του θηρίου. But how ever it be rendered it need <a id="l915"></a>not be understood as relating to the time but onely to the form <a id="l916"></a>of the Vision wherein future things were represented as present: <a id="l917"></a>much after the same manner that before the prophesy of the Trumpets <a id="l918"></a>it is said of the Palm-bearing multitude; These are they <a id="l919"></a>which came out of great tribulation &amp; have washed their <a id="l920"></a>robes, ἔπλυναν τὰς στολὰς  And yet they were <a id="l921"></a>not come out of that tribulation before the sounding of <a id="l922"></a>the seventh Trumpet: Or that the Lamb was said to be <a id="l923"></a>slain from the foundation of the world, becaus it was so in the <a id="l924"></a>foresight &amp; decree of God who beholds futurities as if actually <a id="l925"></a>present.</p>
<p id="par70">And this interpretation is confirmed by the interweaving <a id="l926"></a>of the visions. ffor that of the <em class="underline">Vials</em> is first introduced by <a id="l927"></a>the appearance of the seven Angels with the seven last plagues <a id="l928"></a>vers 1, &amp; then that of the Victors over the <em class="underline">Beast</em> inserted <a id="l929"></a>vers 2, 3, &amp; 4, &amp; afterwards the narration of the former <a id="l930"></a>vision of the Angels continued vers 5, 6 &amp;c. And this inter<a id="l931"></a>weaving implies that they are collateral, &amp; consequently, that <a id="l932"></a>the Beast &amp; victors over him are to live in the time of the <a id="l933"></a>Vials.</p>

<p id="par73">This I prove in the following particulars. 1 The same <a id="l952"></a>kingdoms are represented  in both those Visions of Daniel: as <a id="l953"></a>might appear by the analogy between them, were it not generally <a id="l954"></a>granted. ffor they both began in Daniel's days, agree in number, <a id="l955"></a>&amp; end into the same fift kingdom. The fift Kingdom is mani<a id="l956"></a>festly the same in both visions; for it is described in one vision <a id="l957"></a>to be a kingdom which God should set up which shall never be destroyed <a id="l958"></a>nor left to other people but shall break in pieces &amp; consume <a id="l959"></a>the four precedent kingdoms &amp; shall stand for ever, Dan 2.44. <a id="l960"></a>And in the other Vision it is said that after the fourth <a id="l961"></a>Beast the kingdom &amp; Dominion &amp; greatness of the kingdom under <a id="l962"></a>the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the <a id="l963"></a>most high whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom – which shall <a id="l964"></a> not pass away nor be destroyed.

<h2 id="hd11" class="cent">PROP. XI. <a id="l974"></a><br>The Kingdom represented by the  Beast <a id="l975"></a>is the same with the fourth Kingdom in Daniel repre<a id="l976"></a>sented by the dreadfull Beast with great iron teeth, <a id="l977"></a>as also by the iron leggs of Nebuchadnezzar's image. <a id="l978"></a>And the  Whore of Babylon is the same with the little horn <a id="l979"></a>of that dreadfull Beast.</h2>
<p id="par76">This I prove in the following particulars. j The same <a id="l980"></a>Kingdoms are represented in both those visions of Daniel; as <a id="l981"></a>might appear by the analogy between them were it not ge<a id="l982"></a>nerally granted. For they both began in Daniel's days, agree in <a id="l983"></a>number &amp; end in the same fift Kingdom. The fift Kingdom is <a id="l984"></a>manifestly the same in both  visions; for it is described in one <a id="l985"></a>vision to be a kingdom which God should set up which shall never <a id="l986"></a>be destroyed nor left to other people but shall break in pieces <a id="l987"></a>&amp; consume the four precedent Kingdoms &amp; shall stand for ever <a id="l988"></a>Dan 2.44. And in the other vision it is said that after the fourth <a id="l989"></a>Beast the Kingdom &amp; Dominion &amp; greatness of the Kingdom under the <a id="l990"></a>whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the <a id="l991"></a>most high whose kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom – which shall <a id="l992"></a>not pass away nor be destroyed Dan 7.14, 26, 27. And so the des<a id="l993"></a>criptions of the fourth Kingdom agree the <em class="underline">iron</em> leggs answer<a id="l994"></a>ing to the <em class="underline">iron</em> teeth &amp; the ten toes to the ten horns, &amp; the <a id="l995"></a>strength &amp; dominion of this Kingdom in both places  is <a id="l996"></a>described exceeding great above that of the other <a id="l997"></a>three.</p>
<p id="par77">2. The Kingdom represented by the  Apocalyptic Beast is <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p037"> &lt;37&gt; </span> <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>of<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the wound cannot continue further then to the  end of this seale, no nor so far, for if it do it will not be a <a id="l998"></a><span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>wound<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> made in the head but one side of the head chopt of. The wound <a id="l999"></a>therefore is healed, that is the beast  revives or reexists before the <a id="l1000"></a>opening of the 7<sup>th</sup> seale.</p>
<p id="par78">Nor does this contradict what was said above: for this beast was healed <a id="l1001"></a>&amp; revived before the other beast caused men to worship him &amp; make his Image <a id="l1002"></a>&amp; therefore must have drawn up his religion after him either at some little <a id="l1003"></a>distance or gradually from his reviving. And if so, then we must by virtue of the <a id="l1004"></a>arguments in the foregoing section assigne the ascention of his religion or the <a id="l1005"></a>most notable period of it to the opening of the 7<sup>th</sup> seale, &amp; his reviving or <a id="l1006"></a>the politicall part of his ascention to some little time before.</p>
<p id="par79">9 Although the Dragon continue to the end a kingdome distinct from the beast yet that is in <a id="l1007"></a>respect of civile dominion, only,  For even his subjects embrace the religion which the beast brought <a id="l1008"></a>out of the bottomless pit &amp; so far may be accounted subjects of the Beast also. For <a id="l1009"></a>all the world wondred after him &amp; worshipped him &amp; the Dragon together ch 13.3, 4. <a id="l1010"></a>And power was given him over all kindreds &amp; tongues &amp; nations. And all that dwell <a id="l1011"></a>upon the earth were to worship him whose names were not written in the book of life. <a id="l1012"></a>vers 7, 8; that is all nations within the compass of this Prophesy: so that the Beast in respect <a id="l1013"></a>of his religion is the universal kingdome beyond whose bounds this Prophesy considers <a id="l1014"></a>nothing. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p038"> &lt;38&gt; </span> the same with that in Daniel represented by the Beast with <a id="l1015"></a>Iron teeth. For both kingdoms have one comon period <a id="l1016"></a>ending into the kingdom of the saints which shall never be <a id="l1017"></a>destroyed, Dan 7, &amp; Rev 11.15, &amp; so at least they are synchro<a id="l1018"></a>nall. And since both were revealed by the council of <a id="l1019"></a>the same God for the same end, (the benefit &amp; establish<a id="l1020"></a>ment of his Church) it is not to be doubted but that one <a id="l1021"></a>was intended to be a key to the other &amp; therefore that <a id="l1022"></a>both relate to the same subject.</p>
<p id="par80">But to put the matter out of controversy, Saint Iohn <a id="l1023"></a>hath <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">signifed this</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp; <span class="sub">very elegantly expressed their</span></span> correspondence by describing the <em class="underline">Beast</em> <a id="l1024"></a>which he saw, to be like a <em class="underline">Leopard</em>, &amp; his feet as the <a id="l1025"></a>feet of a <em class="underline">Bear</em> &amp; his mouth as the mouth of a <em class="underline">Lyon</em>, <a id="l1026"></a>ch 13.2. ffor these three being the Beasts by which the <a id="l1027"></a>three first Kingdoms were represented in Daniel, the <a id="l1028"></a>naming of them all in this description of the Beast by <a id="l1029"></a>Saint Iohn seems to be on purpose to point at the vision <a id="l1030"></a>of Daniel &amp; insinuate the correspondence between the <a id="l1031"></a>two Prophesies.</p>
<p id="par81">And in that onely three of those Beasts, the Leopard <a id="l1032"></a>Beare &amp; Lyon are named, it implies that the Beast <a id="l1033"></a>described must supply the place of the fourth to make up <a id="l1034"></a>the quaternary. Which he doth the more fitly because <a id="l1035"></a>they are set down in order backward &amp; he is put <a id="l1036"></a>in the first place, &amp; also becaus of his shape, he being <a id="l1037"></a>neither Leopard Beare nor Lyon but a strange Monster <a id="l1038"></a>as was that other dreadful &amp; terrible Beast with Iron <a id="l1039"></a>teeth, &amp; having <em class="underline">ten horns</em> as the other had.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p039"> &lt;39&gt; </span> </p>
<p id="par82">3. The Kingdom therefore represented in the Apocalyps <a id="l1048"></a>by the  Beast is the same with that represented by <a id="l1049"></a>Daniel's fourth Beast, &amp; consequently the same with that <a id="l1050"></a>represented by the Leggs of Nebuchadnezzar's Image.</p>
<p id="par83">4. The  whore of Babylon is the same with  <a id="l1051"></a>the little horn of Daniel's fourth Beast. ffor the  Whore hath the same relation to the kings signified by the <a id="l1053"></a>ten horns of his fellow beast that the little horn hath <a id="l1054"></a>to the horns of his Beast. Both of them are mem<a id="l1055"></a>bers of the same fourth Kingdom, &amp; both rise up after <a id="l1056"></a>their fellows &amp; exalt themselves above them. ffor of the <a id="l1057"></a>little horn it is said that his look was stouter then his <a id="l1058"></a>fellows Dan 7.26, &amp; that he had eyes &amp; a mouth to represent him as a head set over them &amp; of the two horned Beast that he <a id="l1059"></a>exercised al the power of the first Beast before him <a id="l1060"></a>&amp; (in form of a whore) sat upon the Beast &amp; ruled over <a id="l1061"></a>the kings of the earth Rev 13.12 &amp; 17.3, 18. The little <a id="l1062"></a>horn spake great words against the most high &amp; wore out <a id="l1063"></a>the saints of the most high &amp; thought to change times <a id="l1064"></a>&amp; laws Dan 7.25; And the two horned Beast spake <a id="l1065"></a>like the Dragon &amp; gave life to the Image that it could speak <a id="l1066"></a>&amp; cause that as many as would not worship it should be <a id="l1067"></a>killed. [He also did great wonders &amp; made fire come down <a id="l1068"></a>from Heaven on the earth in the sight of men whereby <a id="l1069"></a>he deceived them &amp; so prevailing with them to observe his <a id="l1070"></a>dictates for laws, caused them to worship the Beast &amp; to <a id="l1071"></a>make an image to him &amp; worship it also.] The little horn <a id="l1072"></a>had eyes as wel as a mouth to show that he  should reign by sharp-sighted policy &amp; subtilty ; &amp; the <a id="l1074"></a>two horned beast is called a fals Prophet, a deceiver, &amp; a <a id="l1075"></a>Whore with <em class="underline">mystery</em> written upon her forehead. The <a id="l1076"></a>little horn made war with the saints &amp; prevailed against <a id="l1077"></a>them Dan 7.21: &amp; the Whore of Babylon was drunken with <a id="l1078"></a>the blood of the saints &amp; of the martyrs of Iesus; – &amp; in her <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p041"> &lt;41&gt; </span> was found the blood of Prophets &amp; of Saints &amp; of all <a id="l1079"></a>that were slain upon the earth. The Dominion of both <a id="l1080"></a>lasted untill the time that the saints possessed the King<a id="l1081"></a>dom Dan 7.21, 22. Rev  16.19 compared with ch 11.15., &amp; was of equal conti<a id="l1082"></a>nuance, namely a time &amp; times &amp; the dividing of time, <a id="l1083"></a>that is, three times or yeares &amp; a half, or two &amp; fourty <a id="l1084"></a>months Dan 7.25. Rev 12.14 &amp; 13.5. And the end of both <a id="l1085"></a>was to be cast into the burning flame Dan 7.11.

<p id="par84">These therefore being members of the same general <a id="l1093"></a>Kingdom &amp; alike related to that kingdom &amp; to their fellow members &amp; through<a id="l1094"></a>out synchronal &amp;  agreeing in their qualities &amp; <a id="l1095"></a>fate must necessarily be allowed the same.</p>

<p id="par94">The same thing appeares also from hence that what<a id="l1158"></a>soever power the two horned Beast exerciseth it is over the <a id="l1159"></a> worshippers of the first Beast . <a id="l1160"></a>ffor he caused the earth &amp; them that dwell therein to worship <a id="l1161"></a>that beast ch 13.12.

It is some kind of Authority &amp; not an Image of wood <a id="l1228"></a>or stone or metal, because it received life from the two <a id="l1229"></a>hornd beast so that it could both speak &amp; cause that as many <a id="l1230"></a>as would not worship it should be killed, &amp; because it was <a id="l1231"></a>not onely worshipped but made by them that dwel on the <a id="l1232"></a>earth, that is, not by an artificer but a multitude. Nor <a id="l1233"></a>is it so likely that a material Image should be made to <a id="l1234"></a>represent a body politique whose form consists not in any <a id="l1235"></a>external shape but in Authority &amp; Dominion.</p>
<p id="par101">4. This Authority is derived from the two horned <a id="l1236"></a>Beast. ffor it was this Beast that injoyned men to make the <a id="l1237"></a>Image, &amp; had power to give life unto it.</p>
<p id="par102">5. It is distinct from the Authority of either Beast, <a id="l1238"></a>being neither the Authority of the ten horned Beast, be<a id="l1239"></a>caus but his Image; nor of the two horned Beast because <a id="l1240"></a>derived from him, and enlivened by his power, nor of both <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p046"> &lt;46&gt; </span> together becaus mentioned together with them both as a <a id="l1241"></a>third thing distinct from both, ch 13 &amp; 19.</p>
<p id="par103">6. It is placed rather in a body politique then in a <a id="l1242"></a>single person. For so it will more truly represent <a id="l1243"></a>the Beast who is not a single person but the most <a id="l1244"></a>universal body politique.</p>
<p id="par104">7. This Image is contemporary with the Beast; <a id="l1245"></a>because wherever it is mentioned, the Beast is menti<a id="l1246"></a>oned with it, as in ch 14.9, 11. ch 15.2. ch 16.2. ch 19.20 <a id="l1247"></a>&amp; ch 20.4: And because it was injoyned to be made <a id="l1248"></a>by the two horned Beast who was contemporary with <a id="l1249"></a>the other Beast, &amp; was made even in the first Vial, <a id="l1250"></a>that is, almost as early as the Beast began his reign.</p>
<p id="par105">8. It is also internal to him, that is, not a forreign kingdome but a Body politique <a id="l1251"></a>comprehended within  those nations which worship the Beast . For this Image is made by them  <a id="l1253"></a>that worshipped the Beast,  as may appear by comparing ch 13. vers 8 <a id="l1255"></a>&amp; 12 with vers 14. Whereas were it a forreign King<a id="l1256"></a>dom it would not be so much an Image of the <a id="l1257"></a>Beast as a distinct Beast it self, having its proper <a id="l1258"></a>subjects. Also it is further observable that where the Beast &amp; fals Prophet are cast into the Lake of <a id="l1259"></a>fire ch 19.20, &amp; 20.10, the Image is omitted, which <a id="l1260"></a>ought not to have been done were it not included <a id="l1261"></a>in the other two. In a word; the Beast, as was <a id="l1262"></a>said above, is the universal Kingdom, beyond which <a id="l1263"></a>nothing is considered in this Prophesy.</p>

<h2 id="hd16" class="cent">PROP. XII. <a id="l1264"></a><br>The seven Heads of the Dragon &amp; Beast <a id="l1265"></a>are the distributions of the Kingdom into <a id="l1266"></a>so many successive parts by the opening <a id="l1267"></a>of the seales in order: every part or <a id="l1268"></a>head being continued from the opening <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p048"> &lt;48&gt; </span> of one seale to the opening of the next <a id="l1269"></a>&amp; the seventh head from the opening of <a id="l1270"></a>the seventh seale to the beginning of the <a id="l1271"></a>seventh Trumpet to sound.</h2>
<p id="par106">And 1 the heads are so many successive parts of the <a id="l1272"></a>Kingdom. For the heads are stiled Kings &amp; those suc<a id="l1273"></a>cessive ch 17.10: Where by Kings you must not un<a id="l1274"></a>derstand single persons, for the Beast which is said to <a id="l1275"></a>be but one of the kings or rather but a part of one, being <a id="l1276"></a>called the eighth &amp; of the seven, is yet said to have ten horns <a id="l1277"></a>&amp; ten  crowns upon his horns to denote so many Kings <a id="l1278"></a>at once comprehended in that part of one. And <a id="l1279"></a>besides, what single Kings reign could be long enough <a id="l1280"></a>for the seventh under which is comprehended all <a id="l1281"></a>that variety of events during the sounding of the <a id="l1282"></a>seven Trumpets, which we shall hereafter show <a id="l1283"></a>to be above a thousand yeares. By a King therefore <a id="l1284"></a>is to be understood an   aggregate of kings whether  collaterall or successive unto some <a id="l1285"></a>determinate period; &amp; not onely  <a id="l1286"></a>Kings, but the whole Kingdom also during that   intervall: for the beast which is said to be the eighth <a id="l1288"></a>King &amp; of the seven, signifies the whole kingdom. <a id="l1289"></a>And  therefore the seven successive Kings are so <a id="l1290"></a>many successive distributions of the Kingdom.</p>
<p id="par107">*<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from p 47 &gt; </span> * 2. The heads are to be recconed in common to the Dragon &amp; Beast, so that <a id="l1291"></a>the first six of them belong to the Dragon alone &amp; the seventh to the Dra<a id="l1292"></a>gon &amp; Beast together. For this is implyed by the saying that the Beast <a id="l1293"></a>is the eighth King &amp; of the seven ch 17.10, 11. Which is as much as to say <a id="l1294"></a>that the Dragon hath seven heads of his own without the Beast &amp; in that <a id="l1295"></a>respect the Beast is but the eighth, &amp; yet he is to be recconed of the <a id="l1296"></a>seven because he does not succeed all the seven heads of the Dragon <a id="l1297"></a>but fall in with the seventh. For by Prop 10 the  Beast falls <a id="l1298"></a>in with the latter part of the Dragon; &amp; he cannot fall in with more <a id="l1299"></a>then the  last of his heads because he is called but the eighth head: <a id="l1300"></a>whereas he would have constituted also a ninth &amp; tenth head &amp;c, had <a id="l1301"></a>he fallen in with more heads then the last</p>
<p id="par108">And hence it is that the Dragon hath seven crowns upon his heads <a id="l1302"></a>to denote his reign in all the seven —</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from p 48 resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par109">2.  And hence the Dragon hath <a id="l1309"></a>seven crowns upon his heads to denote his reign in <a id="l1310"></a>all the seven, but the heads of the Beast are without <a id="l1311"></a>crowns becaus his reign takes  up   no more then the last head. But yet to discriminate his last head <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p049"> &lt;49&gt; </span> from the rest, the ten horns on which are ten <a id="l1313"></a>crowns must be imagined to stand upon that.  For in ch 17.12,  <a id="l1318"></a>in the time of the sixt head (defined in vers 10) it is <a id="l1319"></a>said, The ten Kings have received no kingdom as <a id="l1320"></a>yet but receive power as kings  the same hower <a id="l1321"></a>with the Beast. And therefore the kings with the <a id="l1322"></a>Beast begin not their actual reign untill the next or last <a id="l1323"></a>head, &amp; by consequence the ten horns with the crowns <a id="l1324"></a>upon them must all stand upon that: For the better <a id="l1325"></a>conception of which it may be convenient to ima<a id="l1326"></a>gin the heads in order one above another, &amp; the <a id="l1327"></a>crowned horns upon the uppermost head.</p>
<p id="par110">Nor need it seem strange that the Beast should <a id="l1328"></a>have seven heads attributed to him &amp; yet be but <a id="l1329"></a>the  seventh; for it was fit that <a id="l1330"></a>the symptomes of the whole Kingdom should be <a id="l1331"></a>recconed in common to both parts to denote their <a id="l1332"></a>connexion, &amp; it is limitation enough of the order <a id="l1333"></a>of their reigning, that onely the heads of the one <a id="l1334"></a>&amp; the horns on the last head of the other are <a id="l1335"></a>crowned. The which will not onely appear not im<a id="l1336"></a>proper but very significant if we further consider <a id="l1337"></a>the relation of this vision to that of Daniel where <a id="l1338"></a>the whole Kingdom, signified here by the Beast &amp; <a id="l1339"></a>Dragon together, is represented by the dreadful Beast <a id="l1340"></a>with iron teeth. For although Saint Iohn's Beast in <a id="l1341"></a>a strict sense be taken onely for  the last part of the <a id="l1342"></a>Kingdom , &amp; therefore his heads <a id="l1343"></a>are without crowns, yet his having the same heads <a id="l1344"></a>with the Dragon may imply that in some respect <a id="l1345"></a>he is to be taken in a larger sense &amp; extended through <a id="l1346"></a>the whole kingdom; namely in respect of Daniel's <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p050"> &lt;50&gt; </span> vision to make this Beast adæquate to that, &amp; thereby <a id="l1347"></a>to signify that they are the same. For this is agreeable <a id="l1348"></a>to the precedent Proposition.; Yea &amp;  Saint Iohn doth some<a id="l1349"></a>times consider this Beast though perhaps not in the same latitude with <a id="l1350"></a>Daniel, so as to extend it through all the heads,  yet in a greater latitude then the seventh head, as is manifest by his calling it in the time of the sixt <a id="l1353"></a>head, The Beast which was &amp; is not &amp; shall ascend <a id="l1354"></a>out of the bottomles pit, &amp; a little after, The Beast that <a id="l1355"></a>was &amp; is not &amp; yet is.</p>
<p id="par111">3. The heads of the Dragon &amp; Beast are the dis<a id="l1356"></a>tributions of the Kingdom according to the seven seales.<a id="l1357"></a> For since Saint Iohn no where distributes it into such parts <a id="l1358"></a>but by the seales &amp; trumpets, &amp; the Beast or  seventh head takes up  the seventh Seale by Prop 10 <a id="l1360"></a>it remains that the first six heads  <a id="l1361"></a> be coincident with the first six seales. And indeed  what els should be meant by calling these heads Kings in ch 17.10 but to point at the four horsmen in the 4 first Seales as being the <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>four<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> of the Kings introduced as a specimen of the rest. </p>
<p id="par112">Object. If the Heads of the Beast be distributions <a id="l1369"></a>of him according to the seales, then six of those seales <a id="l1370"></a>were opened in Saint Iohn's time, which is to make him pro<a id="l1371"></a>phesy of things past. For when he wrote the Apo<a id="l1372"></a>calyps he said of the heads that five are fallen &amp; <a id="l1373"></a>one is ch 17.10</p>
<p id="par113">Resp. This expression is not to be  referred <a id="l1374"></a>to the time of writing the Apocalyps but to the time <a id="l1375"></a>which was looked upon as present in the vision: For thus <a id="l1376"></a>in many other places things are spoken of as past or <a id="l1377"></a>present becaus past or present in the visions though to <a id="l1378"></a>come in Saint Iohn's time. As for the time of this <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p051"> &lt;51&gt; </span> expression it was when one of the seven Angels which had <a id="l1379"></a>the seven Vials, talked with Saint Iohn, showing him the <a id="l1380"></a>judgment of the great Whore &amp; expounding that Vision <a id="l1381"></a>to him ch 17.1, 7, 10. &amp; therefore it could not precede the <a id="l1382"></a>vision of those Angels. Now their first appeareance was <a id="l1383"></a>when they came out of the temple to pour out the seven <a id="l1384"></a>vials, &amp; therefore that must be the highest time. And it is <a id="l1385"></a>most proper to refer it to that time as being the common <a id="l1386"></a>Epocha of these collaterall visions of the Vials &amp; Whore. <a id="l1387"></a>And so since the Vials take up almost all the seventh <a id="l1388"></a>head, this vision of the Angels which immediately precedes <a id="l1389"></a>them may fall into the sixt: which agrees with the ex<a id="l1390"></a>pression at that time that five are fallen &amp; one is</p>
<p id="par114">And this is confirmed by comparing it with another <a id="l1391"></a>saying of the Angel at the same time, viz: that the <a id="l1392"></a>Beast was &amp; is not &amp; shall ascend out of the bottomless <a id="l1393"></a>pit. For it will be difficult to refer that to any <a id="l1394"></a>other time then that of the sixt seale.  For it is not likely that the non existence of the beast should be of any great duration or fall in with any other time then that or at least some part of that wherein came the kingdome of God &amp; power of his Christ after the Dragon was cast out.</p>

<h2 id="hd17" class="cent">PROP. XIII. <a id="l1398"></a><br>The ten hornes of the Beast are ten con<a id="l1399"></a>temporary Kingdoms voluntarily uniting <a id="l1400"></a>&amp; conspiring into one Body politique called <a id="l1401"></a>the Beast.</h2>
<p id="par115">And 1 that the ten horns are so many Kings is implyed <a id="l1402"></a>by the crowns upon them &amp; also expresly affirmed ch 17.12 <a id="l1403"></a>And not onely Kings but successions of them with their Kingdoms, for so  a horn is <a id="l1404"></a> used to signify  Def <span class="hspac-n" title="Space left blank."></span>.</p>
<p id="par116">2 They are contemporary &amp; not successive Kings <a id="l1405"></a>ffor this also the horns of a Beast imply when they appear <a id="l1406"></a>together, as is evident by Daniel's vision of the Ram &amp; <a id="l1407"></a>Goat. And much more ought it to be so in this Beast <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p052"> &lt;52&gt; </span> because the other kings which are successive have a different repre<a id="l1408"></a>sentation, being signified each by one crown upon a head. For as one <a id="l1409"></a>crown upon a head is made the emblem of monarchichal government <a id="l1410"></a>in the Dragon, so the ten crowns upon one head must according to the <a id="l1411"></a>analogy signify so many kings at once in the Beast. And if it <a id="l1412"></a>were not so, the little horn in Daniel which rose up after the other <a id="l1413"></a>ten could not well be said to rise up <em class="underline">among them</em> ביגיהן Dan 7.8: nor to root up three of them vers 8, &amp; 20, &amp; much less after that <a id="l1414"></a>have <em class="underline">fellows</em> סבדחהּ vers 20. The ten toes also of Nebuchadnezzar's Image <a id="l1415"></a>imply so many collaterall kingdoms into which the fourth <a id="l1416"></a>Kingdom was to be rent Yea Daniel expresly affirms that it should be divided, &amp; that its parts should not stick to one <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>another<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>. And the same may be collected <a id="l1417"></a>from severall expressions in the Apocalyps, as that those <a id="l1418"></a>Kings are said to receive power as Kings about the same <a id="l1419"></a>time with the Beast, &amp; to agree &amp; give their  kingdom <a id="l1420"></a>unto the Beast untill the words of God shall be fulfilled: <a id="l1421"></a>which cannot be understood of successive kings. Again, <a id="l1422"></a>the Whore is said to sit upon peoples &amp; multitudes &amp; <a id="l1423"></a>nations &amp; tongues &amp; to reign over the kings of the <a id="l1424"></a>earth ch 17.1, 15, 18. And that all nations have drunk <a id="l1425"></a>of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, &amp; the Kings <a id="l1426"></a>of the earth have committed fornication with her <a id="l1427"></a>ch 18.3: where by kings of the earth must be under<a id="l1428"></a>stood Kings of the several nations which she sits upon <a id="l1429"></a>&amp; makes drunk. So ch 18.9, 10 it is said that the Kings <a id="l1430"></a>of the earth who have committed fornication &amp; lived <a id="l1431"></a>deliciously with her shall bewail her &amp; lament her <a id="l1432"></a>when they shall see the smoak of her burning – <a id="l1433"></a>saying, Alas, alas, that great City Babylon, — for in <em class="underline">one <a id="l1434"></a>hower</em> is thy judgment come. And in ch 17.16, 17, that <a id="l1435"></a>the ten horns (after the time is fulfilled that God <a id="l1436"></a>shall put in their hearts to agree &amp; give their king<a id="l1437"></a>dom to the Beast) shall hate the whore &amp; shall make <a id="l1438"></a>her desolate &amp; naked, &amp; shall eat her flesh &amp; burn <a id="l1439"></a>her with fire. Which places must necessarily be inter<a id="l1440"></a>preted of several kings at once. [And lastly in the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p053"> &lt;53&gt; </span> Battel of the great day of God Almighty, the Beast with <a id="l1441"></a>the Kings of the earth &amp; their armies, are gathered together <a id="l1442"></a>against him (the word of God) that sate upon the hors &amp; <a id="l1443"></a>against his army ch 19.19 &amp; 16.14, &amp; therefore the kings <a id="l1444"></a>which untill that time give their power &amp; strength unto the <a id="l1445"></a>Beast are many together, &amp; the expression, <em class="underline">Kings of the <a id="l1446"></a>earth</em>, in this Prophesy is to be understood of collateral Kings.]</p>
<p id="par117">3. These Kings give their power &amp; strength &amp; kingdom to <a id="l1447"></a>the Beast voluntarily, &amp; not by compulsion. ffor it is said <a id="l1448"></a>that they have <em class="underline">one mind</em>, &amp; that God hath <em class="underline">put in their</em> <a id="l1449"></a>hearts to fulfill his will &amp; to <em class="underline">agree</em> &amp; <em class="underline">give</em> their kingdom <a id="l1450"></a>unto the Beast. And the Whore is said to commit forni<a id="l1451"></a>cation with them, &amp; make all nations drunk with the wine <a id="l1452"></a>of her fornication &amp; to deceive them with her sorceries <a id="l1453"></a>Ch 18.3, 24. And so the two hornd Beast is said to deceive <a id="l1454"></a>them by his miracles &amp; by making fire come down from <a id="l1455"></a>heaven. So that they are perswaded into an unani<a id="l1456"></a>mous subjection by Sophistry &amp; subtile delusions, but not <a id="l1457"></a>conquered by the sword.</p>
<p id="par118">4 These Kings thus conspiring into one body poli<a id="l1458"></a>tique are the very Beast. ffor the horns of a Beast are <a id="l1459"></a>used to signify the number of particular kingdoms or Dynasties of <a id="l1460"></a>which the universal Kingdom represented by the whole Beast <a id="l1461"></a>is composed: as may be seen in Daniel where the two <a id="l1462"></a>horns of the Ram were the Kings or Kingdoms of the <a id="l1463"></a>Medes &amp; Persians which composed that general Kingdom <a id="l1464"></a>&amp; the four horns of the Goat were the four princi <a id="l1465"></a>pall Kingdoms of which the Greecian universal Kingdom <a id="l1466"></a>after the death of Alexander consisted. And in <a id="l1467"></a>like manner the ten horns of this Beast must denote <a id="l1468"></a>so many Kings or Kingdoms all which together make up <a id="l1469"></a>the universal Kingdom signified by the whole Beast. <a id="l1470"></a>ffor these Kings which  in the sixt head had received <a id="l1471"></a>no Kingdoms whence could they receive them but  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p054"> &lt;54&gt; </span> from the Dragon, by sharing his body among them in the <a id="l1472"></a>time of the last head? Which if it be supposed, yet <a id="l1473"></a>the universal Kingdom will be still continued in the ag<a id="l1474"></a>gregate of those Kingdoms, as well as the Græcian King<a id="l1475"></a>dom after the death of Alexander was, according to <a id="l1476"></a>Daniel's representation of it by one Beast with four <a id="l1477"></a>horns, continued in the aggregate of his sucessors; &amp; <a id="l1478"></a>on this account more properly that they have one <a id="l1479"></a>mind, &amp; that god shall put in their hearts – to agree <a id="l1480"></a>&amp; give their kingdom unto the Beast, that is, to  constitute the Beast, or so <a id="l1482"></a>to agree &amp; combine together that their kingdoms <a id="l1483"></a>shall be, as it were, but  one Kingdom , &amp; by consequence the  very Beast. <a id="l1485"></a>For in the expression of giving their <em class="underline">Kingdom</em> to <a id="l1486"></a>the Beast, it is to be observed that all their Kingdoms <a id="l1487"></a>together are called their Kingdom in the singular <a id="l1488"></a>number &amp; so esteemed as if but one Kingdom, which may <a id="l1489"></a>therefore be well represented by one Beast notwithstand<a id="l1490"></a>ing the subdivisions.</p>
<p id="par119">And unless this be allowed, the Beast must have more <a id="l1491"></a>horns then ten; for there are ten horns in the Kingdom <a id="l1492"></a>which the kings give unto him, &amp; if he have any other <a id="l1493"></a>Kingdom distinct from the Whore or little horn, there must be one more horn at least in that</p>
<p id="par120">But for further confirmation of this particular, it is <a id="l1494"></a>to be observed that the Whore in one place is said to <a id="l1495"></a>sit upon the Beast, in another place to sit upon many <a id="l1496"></a>waters, which are peoples &amp; multitudes &amp; nations &amp; <a id="l1497"></a>tongues, &amp; in another place to be the great city which <a id="l1498"></a>ruleth over the Kings of the earth, ch 17.1, 3, 15, 18. And <a id="l1499"></a>by consequence, the Beast, the many waters or Nations <a id="l1500"></a>&amp; the Kings of the Earth must signify the same thing <a id="l1501"></a>since they are indifferently used for one another.</p>
<p id="par121">And this is further signified by Nebuchadnezzar's Image <a id="l1502"></a>whose feet &amp; toes were described to be part of iron &amp; part <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p055"> &lt;55&gt; </span> of clay to signify the aptness of the Kingdom to be rent into <a id="l1503"></a>less Dynasties toward the latter end of it. And the <a id="l1504"></a>distributions of the leggs into ten toes imply the rending <a id="l1505"></a>of it into so many kingdoms, the aggregate of which is still <a id="l1506"></a>to be esteemed the same universal kingdom as before the <a id="l1507"></a>division because they are represented by the toes which to<a id="l1508"></a>gether with the feet &amp; leggs in Daniel's estimation <a id="l1509"></a>constituted but one &amp; the same fourth kingdom.</p>
<p id="par122">[And lastly this is evident by the universality of <a id="l1510"></a>the Beast, whom all the earth was to wonder after <a id="l1511"></a>&amp; to worship &amp; to receive his mark.</p>

<span class="pagenumber" id="p056"> &lt;56&gt; </span>
<p id="par124">1. The horns were kingdoms  derived from the Dragon. For <a id="l1534"></a>since the horns which  upon the Beast's head have their <a id="l1535"></a>proper crowns, are upon the Dragon's head also, &amp; that without <a id="l1536"></a>any other crowns then the common one of the Head; they must <a id="l1537"></a>represent the same kingdoms or nations subject to one common King <a id="l1538"></a>in the reign of the Dragon which were afterwards in the reign <a id="l1539"></a>of the Beast to obtein their proper Kings. For that this is the <a id="l1540"></a>proper interpretation of these circumstances is manifest by the saying <a id="l1541"></a>in the  time of the sixt seale. That the kings had not then <a id="l1542"></a>received their kingdoms but were to receive them about the same <a id="l1543"></a>time with the Beast. So Dan 7.24 The ten horns out of this <a id="l1544"></a>Kingdom are ten Kings that shall arise, i.e. that shall <a id="l1545"></a>arise out of this Kingdom: The force of which place will <a id="l1546"></a>appear more fully by considering that since they arise <a id="l1547"></a>in the middle of his reign, if they did not arise out of him <a id="l1548"></a>his preceding &amp; following parts could not make one &amp; the <a id="l1549"></a>same beast. This dividing of the kingdom is also signified <a id="l1550"></a>by the toes &amp; by the mixture of Iron &amp; clay in the feet <a id="l1551"></a>of Nebuchadnezzar's Image, compared with Daniel's expli<a id="l1552"></a>cation thereof, as was signified in the precedent Propo<a id="l1553"></a>sition where this assertion was occasionally touched on.</p>

<p id="par126">2. The Dragon amongst the Kingdoms  divided from him <a id="l1566"></a>became one of the horns of the beast. For since the Dragon <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p057"> &lt;57&gt; </span> survived the rise of the Beast &amp; consequently the  dividing <a id="l1567"></a>of the other kingdoms from him, he must either be <a id="l1568"></a>recconed among those other kingdoms to make up the <a id="l1569"></a>number of the horns or remain a kingdom external <a id="l1570"></a>to the Beast. But not external, for that is repugnant to <a id="l1571"></a>the universality of the Beast described by Saint Iohn, &amp; much <a id="l1572"></a>more to the Vision of Daniel whose Beast comprehends <a id="l1573"></a>the Dragon even before the rise of Saint Iohn's Beast. <a id="l1574"></a>He is therefore comprehended within the Beast &amp; by con<a id="l1575"></a>sequence one of his horns. ffor in that he is a kingdom <a id="l1576"></a>a crown must belong to him, &amp; the Beast hath no other <a id="l1577"></a>crowns but those upon his horns.</p>
<p id="par127">Yea this is expresly declared in ch 13.2, 4, where it <a id="l1578"></a>is said that the Dragon <em class="underline">gave</em> the Beast <em class="underline">his power</em> &amp; his <a id="l1579"></a>seat &amp; great authority: Which is not to be interpreted <a id="l1580"></a>as if he parted with all his power, for so he would have ceased <a id="l1581"></a>to be; But the sense is that having parted with some he gave him the remainder by assisting him <a id="l1582"></a>therewith, as will  appear by comparing this place <a id="l1583"></a>with ch 17.13 where the ten kings are in like manner <a id="l1584"></a>said to give their power &amp; strength to the Beast, that <a id="l1585"></a>is to give him their kingdom v 17, which is the same thing <a id="l1586"></a>with their becoming his horns. And therefore  <a id="l1587"></a>according to the analogy of these two places, the Dra<a id="l1588"></a>gon with the rest of the Kings do all contribute to in<a id="l1589"></a>large the power &amp; dominion of the Beast by the <a id="l1590"></a>access of their power &amp; strength &amp; territories, &amp; so all <a id="l1591"></a>become his horns: yea the Dragon more eminently then <a id="l1592"></a>the rest, since from him, according to ch 17, the Beast borrowed <a id="l1593"></a>the greatest of his power.</p>

<p id="par128">This the very soundings of the Trumpets imply, as <a id="l1596"></a>being so many Alarms to War. But I shall run over the <a id="l1597"></a>particulars.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p059"> &lt;59&gt; </span>
<p id="par129">At the first Trumpet the Hail &amp; fire mingled with <a id="l1598"></a><em class="underline">blood</em>; at the second Vial the sea becoming <em class="underline">blood</em> <a id="l1599"></a>as of a dead man, &amp; every thing dying in it, &amp; at the <a id="l1600"></a>third Vial the fountains becoming <em class="underline">blood</em>, &amp; God's giving <a id="l1601"></a>them blood to drink because they had shed the blood of <a id="l1602"></a>his saints; are sufficient indications of war.

<p id="par130">Also at the fourth Trumpet or Vial the smiting of the <a id="l1608"></a>Sun Moon &amp; Stars, signifies the overthrow of some <a id="l1609"></a>King or kingdom,  by Def <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>: &amp; so most probably <a id="l1610"></a>implies war.</p>
<p id="par131">***<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from p 58 &gt; </span> *** And in all these four there is also an impression of war by <a id="l1611"></a>fire &amp; burning.

<p id="par132">The wars of these four Trumpets are also signified by <a id="l1616"></a>the four winds in chap 7.1, of which we shall have occasion to <a id="l1617"></a>speak in Prop <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p id="par133">Moreover at the fift Trumpet —<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from p 59 resumes &gt; </span> At the fift Trumpet there arose Locusts like <a id="l1618"></a>horses prepared to battel, with faces like men (i.e. <a id="l1619"></a>Horsmen) &amp; <em class="underline">Breastplates</em> as of Iron.

<p id="par134">At the sixt there were let loos four Kings with <a id="l1622"></a>an Army of horsmen with Breastplates &amp; license to kill <a id="l1623"></a>men.</p>
<p id="par135">And at the seventh the Beast with the Kings of the <a id="l1624"></a>Earth were gathered together against him that sat on the <a id="l1625"></a>hors &amp; against his Army, &amp; there followed a great Hail **<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from p 58 &gt; </span>** with thundrings &amp; lightnings &amp; a great shaking; which are the singular im<a id="l1626"></a>pressions of a great battel by Def <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p id="par143">  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p063"> &lt;63&gt; </span> </p>
<p id="par144">But to make this limitation yet more firm it may be <a id="l1710"></a>further considered that as the first four seales in ch 6 <a id="l1711"></a>were ushered in by the four Beasts, so the first four <a id="l1712"></a>Trumpets are ushered in apart by their four Angels <a id="l1713"></a>standing on the corners of the Earth ch 7.1. For that <a id="l1714"></a>these were the Angels, not which sounded, but which exe<a id="l1715"></a>cuted the consequent effects is manifest becaus to them <a id="l1716"></a>it was given to hurt the <em class="underline">earth</em> &amp; the <em class="underline">sea</em>, &amp; another <a id="l1717"></a>Angel cryed to them saying, Hurt not the <em class="underline">Earth</em> neither <a id="l1718"></a>the <em class="underline">Sea</em> nor the <em class="underline">Trees</em> till we have sealed the ser<a id="l1719"></a>vants of our God in their foreheads.

For the winds wherewith the Angels were to hurt the earth &amp; the Sea &amp;c: are so many wars by Def. <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; therefore we are to suppose that the Angels let go these winds successively as being the 4 first of the 7 successive woes of the Trumpets. And from <a id="l1724"></a>this combination of these four Trumpets may be argued <a id="l1725"></a>that they relate to things of the same nature with one <a id="l1726"></a>another, &amp; of a different nature from the contents of <a id="l1727"></a>the three last which by the want of Angels are distinguish<a id="l1728"></a>ed from them. For otherwise the introduction of the <a id="l1729"></a>four Angels &amp; their limitation to that number would <a id="l1730"></a>be an insignificant circumstance.</p>
<p id="par145">But to put the matter out of doubt, the holy ghost <a id="l1731"></a>has again signified the combination of the four first <a id="l1732"></a>Trumpets by parting them as it were from the three <a id="l1733"></a>last by the interposition of an Angel flying through <a id="l1734"></a>the midst of heaven &amp; saying with a loud voice, Wo, <a id="l1735"></a>Wo wo to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p065"> &lt;65&gt; </span> the other voices of the Trumpet of the three Angels <a id="l1736"></a>which are yet to sound. </p>

<p id="par154">But to comprehend them all together: they are all necessarily implied in the times <a id="l1836"></a>immediately before the death of the witnesses because till then the enemies of the Church pre<a id="l1837"></a>vailed more &amp; more over her, &amp; they are inconsistent with the times after their <a id="l1838"></a>resurrection becaus  from that time she prevailes over her enemies untill first the <a id="l1839"></a>great City &amp; soon after the whole Kingdom of the Beast be overthrown. For at the very re<a id="l1840"></a>surrection of the witnesses she frighted her enemies &amp; was no longer hid in the wilderness <a id="l1841"></a>but became visible to all the world who beheld her as a cloud for multitude, Def <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p068"> &lt;68&gt; </span> The numbers therefore since they all express the time of the churches desolation &amp; her <a id="l1842"></a>enemies prevailing over her, must end between these two periods.

The killing of the witness<a id="l1847"></a>es therefore puts an absolute end to all things to which the 1260 days are applied <a id="l1848"></a>&amp;  so must be the common period of those days. I say an end: for if <a id="l1849"></a>any one tell me that Christ has promised that the gates of hell shall not prevail against the <a id="l1850"></a>Church &amp; therefore she cannot be interrupted, I return that other saying of his: when the <a id="l1851"></a>Son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth. As there was intermission of the Iew<a id="l1852"></a>ish Kingdom for 70 years in the  Babylonian Capitivity notwithstanding the promis that the Scripture should <a id="l1853"></a>not depart from Iudah till Shiloh came, so  in our Saviour's promis a short intermission of the Ch may not be ac<a id="l1854"></a>counted a prævailing against her becaus not a final nor durable prevailing, nor  yet so absolute but that her <a id="l1855"></a>works  may continue in the earth, some men remaining well disposed to receive the truth though at present carried away <a id="l1856"></a>with the streame,  others seeking after it &amp; perhaps discerning &amp;  believing it but yet imperfectly like those Pharissees that <a id="l1857"></a>feared to confess it least they should be put out of the Synagogue or at least some believing one truth, others another so as among them all to retain the whole, &amp; if you will go farther &amp; suppose <a id="l1858"></a>some few true believers in all that is necessary, I shall not  gainsay it so you will but suppose 'em so few as  here not to <a id="l1859"></a>come into compute.</p>
<p id="par155"> Some I know will  say that the witnesses are two single persons, &amp; so their slaying <a id="l1860"></a>infers not any such deliquium of the Church. But they that will not be pervers may easily <a id="l1861"></a>discern that they  are something diffused through the whole Beast's dominion since  it was not <a id="l1862"></a>a few men but the Beast that made war with them &amp; killed them,  not a single City or nation but <a id="l1863"></a> peoples kindreds tongues &amp; nations that rejoyced over them &amp; saw them rise again &amp; <a id="l1864"></a>ascend to heaven in a cloud.

<p id="par161">3. These  Synchronals begin with the Wo-trumpets, <a id="l1901"></a> This is a  conclusion of main importance &amp; therefore I shall be the more particular in the proof of it, urging for that end the following arguments.</p>
<p id="par162">Arg: 1. The wound of the Beast was healed at the <a id="l1902"></a>end of the fourth Trumpet by Prop 14. And this Syn<a id="l1903"></a>chronism is dated from the healing of that wound.  <a id="l1904"></a>Now that this synchronism is dated from the healing of that wound I prove by these reasons.</p>
<p id="par163">ffirst the 42 Months of the Beast must either be <a id="l1905"></a>dated from the healing of his wound or from his first <a id="l1906"></a>rise, for there is no other remarkable Epocha within <a id="l1907"></a>his reign. But it cannot be dated from his first rise be<a id="l1908"></a>cause it is synchronal to the reign of Daniel's little horn, &amp; <a id="l1909"></a>this arose not till after the other ten horns which constitute <a id="l1910"></a>the Beast. The same may be argued from the Whore <a id="l1911"></a>for it was shown above in Prop: 7, that she arrived not to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p070"> &lt;70&gt; </span> her dominion so as to sit upon the Beast untill some <a id="l1912"></a>time after he was risen.</p>



<p id="par167"><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p071"> &lt;71&gt; </span></p>
<p id="par168">ffourthly this 42 Months of the Beast is  not <a id="l1958"></a>called the time of his continuance but the time of his <a id="l1959"></a>making war. Ἐδόθη ἀυτω ἐξουσία πόλεμον πόιησαι <a id="l1960"></a>μηνας τεσσαράκοντα δύο. There was given unto him <a id="l1961"></a>power to make war forty &amp; two months. And con<a id="l1962"></a>cerning this his Worshippers, in the vers before, proclaim <a id="l1963"></a>saying, Who is like unto the Beast? who is able to <a id="l1964"></a>make war with him? So that these two &amp; forty <a id="l1965"></a>Months are not spoken of his whole continuance but <a id="l1966"></a>of the time onely wherein he had power to make <a id="l1967"></a>war, or made war powerfully in so much that none <a id="l1968"></a>were able to make war with him: &amp; therefore must <a id="l1969"></a>necessarily exclude the time of his being wounded to <a id="l1970"></a>death by war, &amp; begin but at his resurrection.</p>
<p id="par169">Conclude we therefore that this synchronism of the 42 months <a id="l1971"></a>is dated from the healing of the wound that is from the <a id="l1972"></a>end of the fourth Trumpet, &amp; so begins with the wo-trum<a id="l1973"></a>pets.</p>

The care taken by the  Holy Ghost to se<a id="l1974"></a>parate the three last Trumpets from the four first, <a id="l1975"></a>both by interposition of an Angel crying Wo, wo, wo, &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p072"> &lt;72&gt; </span> by introducing the four Trumpets first apart by their <a id="l1976"></a>four Angels, must needs imply some considerable difference <a id="l1977"></a>in the nature of the times which they relate unto, &amp; so that <a id="l1978"></a>the Wo-trumpets begin with some new scene of things, as <a id="l1979"></a>was signified above. And therefore it will be more <a id="l1980"></a>naturall to make them begin with this Synchronism then <a id="l1981"></a>to combine all the seven Trumpets therein by ex<a id="l1982"></a>tending it through them all.</p>

<p id="par172">Arg: 3. This Synchronism is of all times the most <a id="l1991"></a>wicked, as is notoriously manifest  by <a id="l1992"></a>the description of the Whore of Babylon  in ch 17 &amp; 18 <a id="l1993"></a>&amp; of the little horn in Daniel so many ages before. &amp; of the latter times both by the Apostles &amp; by Daniel in his other visions <a id="l1994"></a>In like manner the Wo-trumpets are represented as <a id="l1995"></a>conteining the greatest judgments of God for wickedness, <a id="l1996"></a>as is manifest by the proclamation of <em class="underline">Wo</em> at the begin<a id="l1997"></a>ning of them. And therefore since it is usuall <a id="l1998"></a>with God to proportion his judgments to wickedness, this <a id="l1999"></a>Synchronism will best agree to these Trumpets.  At least the <a id="l2000"></a>denunciation of <em class="underline">Wo</em> at the beginning of them is    a de<a id="l2001"></a>claration of God's anger at the aggravation of the wick<a id="l2002"></a>edness commencing at that time: &amp;  I see not  what wickedness that can bee  besides the beginning of this Synchronism.</p>
<p id="par173">Arg: 4. This Synchronism is generally acknowledged <a id="l2003"></a>to be the famous reign of Antichrist or man of Sin of <a id="l2004"></a>whome Saint Paul to the Thessalonians ch: 2, said, Ye know <a id="l2005"></a>what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time: <a id="l2006"></a>For the mystery of iniquity doth already work onely <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p073"> &lt;73&gt; </span> he who now letteth will let untill he be taken out <a id="l2007"></a>of the way. Now he who letteth is  by the tradition of the Ancients, the Roman Empire, that Kingdom <a id="l2009"></a>whose fate is described in the Seales &amp; Trumpets. And <a id="l2010"></a>therefore the man of Sin cannot be taken out of the way <a id="l2011"></a>nor this Synchronism begin before that Kingdom be taken <a id="l2012"></a>out of the way. Search now the Apocalyps from the <a id="l2013"></a>first  seale to the last Trumpet, <a id="l2014"></a>&amp; you will find nothing that can signify this taking <a id="l2015"></a>away beside the sixt Seale &amp; fourth Trumpet; for in <a id="l2016"></a>them onely is the smiting of the Luminaries which is the <a id="l2017"></a>proper  Emblem of the overthrow of a kingdom <a id="l2018"></a>But I shewed in  Prop  10 that the sixt seale was <a id="l2019"></a>to be interpreted of spirituall matters without diminish<a id="l2020"></a>ing the temporall power of the Kingdom, &amp; therefore <a id="l2021"></a>it is onely in the fourth Trumpet that this taking <a id="l2022"></a>away can happen. And that then it does happen <a id="l2023"></a> will appear in the application of this Prophesy to history</p>

<p id="par175"><span class="large">These Arguments</span> might suffice to evince <a id="l2034"></a>this important part of the Proposition, but yet I shall <a id="l2035"></a>add one more, because, beside the strength it hath <a id="l2036"></a>for this end, it conteins a notable determination <a id="l2037"></a>of something more then is to be found in the Apo<a id="l2038"></a>calyps.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p074"> &lt;74&gt; </span>
<p id="par176">Arg: 5. The Whore of Babylon was to be forgotten <a id="l2039"></a>or left desolate seventy yeares immediately before her <a id="l2040"></a>reign. But this cannot happen at any other time then in <a id="l2041"></a>the fourth Trumpet, &amp; therefore her reign begins with <a id="l2042"></a>the fift.</p>
<p id="par177">The major Proposition I prove out of Isa. 23.15, 16, 17, 18 <a id="l2043"></a>where it is thus written.</p>
<p id="par178">"And it shall come to pass in that day that Tyre shall be for<a id="l2044"></a>gotten seventy years according to the days of one King: After <a id="l2045"></a>seventy years shall Tyre sing  as an Harlot. Take an <a id="l2046"></a>harp, go about the City thou Harlot that hast been forgotten, <a id="l2047"></a>make sweet melody, sing many songs that thou mayest be <a id="l2048"></a>remembered. And it shall come to pass after the end of <a id="l2049"></a>seventy yeares that the Lord will visit Tyre, &amp; she shall <a id="l2050"></a>turn to her hire, &amp; shall commit fornication with all <a id="l2051"></a>the Kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. <a id="l2052"></a>And her merchandise &amp; her hire shall be holiness to the <a id="l2053"></a>Lord. It shall not be treasured  nor laid up; for her <a id="l2054"></a>merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the <a id="l2055"></a>Lord, to eat sufficiently, &amp; for durable cloathing."</p>
<p id="par179">The circumstances of this Prophesy do in all respects <a id="l2056"></a>suit with the whore of Babylon but not with the City of <a id="l2057"></a>Tyre, &amp; therefore I shall not doubt here by Tyre to <a id="l2058"></a>understand this whore.</p>
<p id="par180">In the name there can be no difficulty becaus the Holy <a id="l2059"></a>Ghost altogether calls the Whore by names borrowed from <a id="l2060"></a>forreign places, as  Babylon, Sodom, Egypt, &amp; (as some <a id="l2061"></a>think) Idumea Isa 34, &amp; there is no reason why he may <a id="l2062"></a>not as well call her Tyre, especially if Tyre in any <a id="l2063"></a>respects besides wickedness (as in bordering upon the Sea. See <a id="l2064"></a>Rev 18.17, 19) do more advantageously then other places <a id="l2065"></a>resemble her. Yea, if I am not mistaken, the holy Ghost <a id="l2066"></a>hath confirmed this name to her in Ezekiel 28. But at <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p075"> &lt;75&gt; </span> least that this place of Isaiah is to be understood of her will <a id="l2067"></a>appear by the following considerations.</p>
<p id="par181">And first whereas Tyre is here called a Harlot &amp; said to commit <a id="l2068"></a>fornication with all the Kingdoms of the world upon the face of the <a id="l2069"></a>Earth: this is the exact description of the whore of Babylon, but can <a id="l2070"></a>in no wise agree to the City Tyre. For none but the Church of God <a id="l2071"></a>can be an Harlot &amp; commit fornication. This is a crime peculiar to <a id="l2072"></a>God's people when they forsake him &amp; go a whoring after other <a id="l2073"></a>Gods or Idols. And therefore although Heathens were universally <a id="l2074"></a>Idolaters yet the holy Ghost never reproves any nation under the notion <a id="l2075"></a>of committing fornication beside the revolting Iews in the old Testament &amp; revolting Christians in the new. But were it otherwise <a id="l2077"></a>so that Tyre be called a Harlot for her Idolatry yet I see not how <a id="l2078"></a>shee should be accused for committing fornication with other nations <a id="l2079"></a>since her dealing with other nations was onely in matters of trade <a id="l2080"></a>&amp; merchandise. Nor does the universality of the expression that Tyre <a id="l2081"></a>should commit fornication with all the Kingdoms of the  <a id="l2082"></a>world upon the face of the earth agree so well to that city as <a id="l2083"></a>to the Whore.</p>
<p id="par182">Secondly I see not how the seventy years of desolation can be <a id="l2084"></a>accommodated to the City of Tyre. ffor from Isaiah's days to Nebu<a id="l2085"></a>chadnezzar's  it continued in prosperity excepting onely five or <a id="l2086"></a>six year's siege &amp; that in vain by Salmanasser, &amp; by Nebuchad<a id="l2087"></a>nezzar it was not onely ruined for seventy years but for ever <a id="l2088"></a>as was prophesied by Ezekiel ch 26. Yet not far from this City <a id="l2089"></a>there was another incompassed by the sea &amp; called by the same name <a id="l2090"></a>but this was not ruined with the other,<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup>  but from that very time governed <a id="l2091"></a>first by Baal their king  for about 10 years &amp; then by Iudges for about seven yeares &amp; three months, &amp; then again by <a id="l2092"></a>Kings (Balator, Merbal Hirom, &amp;c)  untill the reign of Cyrus &amp; from thence for any thing that appears to the contrary flourished till it was utterly destroyed by Alexander the <a id="l2094"></a>great under <span class="hspac-n" title="9 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> its last King.</p>
<p id="par183">Thirdly in that these seventy yeares are said to be accord<a id="l2095"></a>ing to the days of one King, is plainly signified that this pro<a id="l2096"></a>phesy is not to be interpreted litterally of Tyre, but hath some <a id="l2097"></a>mystical meaning in it. For what King since Isaiah's days <a id="l2098"></a>hath reigned 70 yeares? But if we refer it to the Whore <a id="l2099"></a>of Babylon, &amp; make the 70 yeares to be the duration of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p076"> &lt;76&gt; </span> fourth Trumpet the interpretation is obvious. Namely that as the <a id="l2100"></a>holy Ghost calls the seven Heads of the Dragon seven Kings <a id="l2101"></a>&amp; these, as I shewed, are the successive parts of the Kingdom <a id="l2102"></a>divided according to the seales: So the like divisions of the <a id="l2103"></a>Beast by the Trumpets may be also called Heads or Kings, <a id="l2104"></a>of which the seventy yeares is the duration of the fourth.</p>
<p id="par184">ffourthly, whereas it is said that Her merchandise &amp; her <a id="l2105"></a>hire shall be holiness to the Lord – &amp; that her merchandise <a id="l2106"></a>shall be for them that dwell before the Lord: it is here in <a id="l2107"></a>so many words declared that by Tyre is meant a people <a id="l2108"></a>whose merchandise &amp; hire, that is, whose possessions are holiness <a id="l2109"></a>unto the Lord, &amp; that the people for whom this merchandise <a id="l2110"></a>is, that is the people of Tyre are they that dwell before <a id="l2111"></a>the Lord. And this is as much as to say that by Tyre is <a id="l2112"></a>meant a people whose possessions are consecrate &amp; set apart <a id="l2113"></a>to the true God, so that they cannot be alienated without <a id="l2114"></a>sacrilege, &amp; a people also that are themselves set apart <a id="l2115"></a>&amp; consecrate to the service of that God. That is in plain <a id="l2116"></a>words, a people whose possessions are the revenues of the <a id="l2117"></a>Church, &amp; which themselves are ecclesiastical persons like <a id="l2118"></a>the Tribe of Levi. And this can in no wise be understood <a id="l2119"></a>of the  City of Tyre; but of the Whore of Baby<a id="l2120"></a>lon it is a most apposite description, according to the charac<a id="l2121"></a>ter of Saint Paul, that the Man of Sin should sit in the <a id="l2122"></a>Temple of God.</p>
<p id="par185">And whereas it is further added, that her merchandise <a id="l2123"></a>shall not be treasured nor laid up – but shal be for them that dwell <a id="l2124"></a>before the Lord to eat sufficiently, &amp; for durable cloathing; <a id="l2125"></a>That is, they shall spend it upon their backs &amp; bellies in <a id="l2126"></a>pride &amp; luxury: this also suits justly with the description <a id="l2127"></a>of the Whore. For of her it is said that the merchants of <a id="l2128"></a>the earth waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies, <a id="l2129"></a>Rev 18.3. And that all  were made rich that had <a id="l2130"></a>ships in the sea by reason of her costliness vers 18. And that <a id="l2131"></a>she was clothed in fine linnen &amp; purple &amp; scarlet &amp; decked <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p077"> &lt;77&gt; </span> with gold &amp; pretious stones &amp; Pearles vers 16. And the mer<a id="l2132"></a>chandise she bought was Gold, Silver, pretious stones, Pearls, fine <a id="l2133"></a>Linnen, Purple, Silk, Scarlet, Sweet Wood, all manner of <a id="l2134"></a>pretious Vessels, — Cinnamon, Odours, Ointments, Frankincens <a id="l2135"></a>Wine, Oyle, fine Flower, Wheat, Beasts, Sheep &amp;c. vers 12, 13.</p>
<p id="par186">These are the reasons by which I here understand <a id="l2136"></a>the Whore of Babylon by Tyre: Which being granted <a id="l2137"></a>&amp; consequently that this Whore was to be forgotten 70 <a id="l2138"></a>yeares &amp; then to sing as an Harlot, &amp; return to her <a id="l2139"></a>hire &amp; commit fornication with all the kings of the <a id="l2140"></a>earth, that is to begin her reign at the end of the 70 <a id="l2141"></a>yeares, which was the Major Proposition; I prove the <a id="l2142"></a>Minor by this consideration that the Whore must have <a id="l2143"></a>began to be (though not to reign) before the 70 years <a id="l2144"></a>ffor otherwise she could not  bee said to have been <a id="l2145"></a>forgotten, nor afterward to return to her hire. But there is no <a id="l2146"></a>signe of her being before the rise of the two horned <a id="l2147"></a>Beast or at the soonest not before the Dragon began <a id="l2148"></a>to chase the Woman into the Wilderness: &amp; therefore <a id="l2149"></a>these seventy yeares must fall within the seventh <a id="l2150"></a>seale. And within that there is no time so suitable <a id="l2151"></a>to this desolation as the fourth Trumpet. Yea it  seems ne<a id="l2152"></a>cessary that she be desolate during the death of her <a id="l2153"></a>Beast therein, &amp; therefore that must be the time since <a id="l2154"></a>there is no mention of her being desolate oftener <a id="l2155"></a>then once.</p>

<h2 id="hd22" class="cent">PROP XVI. <a id="l2156"></a><br>The Temple within the holy City troden <a id="l2157"></a>under foot by the Gentiles, denotes the <a id="l2158"></a>same thing with the Woman in the Wilderness <a id="l2159"></a>persecuted by the Dragon &amp; Beast: the  </h2>

<p id="par187"> </p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p078"> &lt;78&gt; </span>
<h2 id="hd23" class="cent">Temple answering to the Woman, the city <a id="l2160"></a>to the Wildernes, &amp; the Gentiles to the   <a id="l2161"></a>seventh head of the Dragon </h2>
<p id="par188">1 The Gentiles are the same with the Beast becaus by <a id="l2162"></a>Prop 16 they are contemporary to him, &amp; all Kindreds &amp; <a id="l2163"></a>tongues &amp; nations, ch 13.7, 16, that is all Gentiles are his Sub<a id="l2164"></a>jects. Also in prosecuting the description of the Gentiles &amp; <a id="l2165"></a>Witnesses, the Beast ch 11.7, &amp; they of the Peoples &amp; kindreds <a id="l2166"></a>&amp; tongues &amp; nations in vers 9 are put in stead of the Gentiles.</p>
<p id="par189">2 The Temple of God with the Altar &amp; them that <a id="l2167"></a>worship therein is the same with the Woman, becaus they <a id="l2168"></a>also by Prop 16 are synchronal, &amp; both signify the true <a id="l2169"></a>church of Christ: the Temple as being dedicated to <a id="l2170"></a>God's worship &amp; inhabited by him, as Saint Paul saith to the <a id="l2171"></a>Corinthians, Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God <a id="l2172"></a>— the Temple of God is holy which Temple ye are, 1 Cor <a id="l2173"></a>3.16, 17; And the Woman as being the Mother of beleevers <a id="l2174"></a>Rev 12.17, &amp; Spouse of Christ, ch 19.7. And therefore <a id="l2175"></a>since there is but one true Church, they must both be the same.</p>
<p id="par190">The Temple indeed may seem to be distinguished from <a id="l2176"></a>the Church by the further mentioning of them that worship <a id="l2177"></a>in the Temple But I take this to be done but by way <a id="l2178"></a>of explanation, , much after the same manner that in the vision of the <a id="l2180"></a>woman it is added that the Dragon went to make war with the <a id="l2181"></a>remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of God, not to <a id="l2182"></a>distinguish the seed from the Woman but to explain the signi<a id="l2183"></a>fication of the Woman thereby. Let therefore the paral<a id="l2184"></a>lel be put between the worshippers in the Temple &amp; the <a id="l2185"></a>seed of the woman, &amp; then the Temple will answer to the <a id="l2186"></a>Woman &amp; so differ from the worshippers in it no otherwise <a id="l2187"></a>then the Woman from her seed, or then the whole from some of its <a id="l2188"></a>members. The same may be argued from the common <a id="l2189"></a>affection of being measured with a reed, which would be impro<a id="l2190"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p079"> &lt;79&gt; </span>per were the things measured of a different kind.</p>
<p id="par191">And as the Temple is a representatve of the living worshippers <a id="l2191"></a>so the Altar therein is of the Martyrs,  concerning whome <a id="l2192"></a>it is said that the former Martyrs represented by the Altar in the <a id="l2193"></a>fift Seale should rest yet for a little season untill their fellow <a id="l2194"></a>servants also that should be killed as they were should be <a id="l2195"></a>fulfilled.</p>
<p id="par192">3 The outward Court &amp; holy City is the same with the wil<a id="l2196"></a>derness, becaus alike related both to the Nations signified by the <a id="l2197"></a>Gentiles &amp; Beast &amp; to the Church signified by the Temple &amp; <a id="l2198"></a>Woman, being inhabited by the one ch. 11.2 &amp; 17.3, &amp; contein<a id="l2199"></a>ing the other; that is, being their common Dition.</p>
<p id="par193">4 This Vision of the Temple &amp; holy City troden under <a id="l2200"></a>foot by the Gentiles begins with the seventh seale &amp; so <a id="l2201"></a>comprehends the last head of the Dragon. In the three for<a id="l2202"></a>mer particulars I considered onely the Synchronism of the 42 <a id="l2203"></a>Months, to which this Vision chiefly relates. But as that Syn<a id="l2204"></a>chronism is dated from a later period then the first rise <a id="l2205"></a>of the Beast or first flight of the woman into the Wilder<a id="l2206"></a>ness: so it must be of a later date then the first appear<a id="l2207"></a>ance of the Temple &amp; Court troden under foot by the <a id="l2208"></a>Gentiles. For since these two visions are of the same signification <a id="l2209"></a>all their parts must correspond to one another &amp; be coextended, <a id="l2210"></a>&amp; consequently the Gentiles must begin to tread underfoot the holy <a id="l2211"></a>city when the Dragon begins to persecute the Woman into the Wilder<a id="l2212"></a>ness: which as I shewed in Prop 10 is at the beginning of the seventh <a id="l2213"></a>seale.</p>
<p id="par194">And for further confirmation of this it may be also considered that <a id="l2214"></a>the measuring of the Temple &amp; Altar &amp; them that worship therein <a id="l2215"></a>with a reed in this vision signifies the same thing with sealing the <a id="l2216"></a>servants of God in their foreheads with the seale of God in <a id="l2217"></a>chap 7 &amp; with the numbering those  by Tribes that were sealed, 12000 of each tribe. ffor sealing or numbring or measuring them are but divers modes <a id="l2218"></a>of expressing God's care for his elect, not much unlike that of <a id="l2219"></a>our Saviour's telling his disciples that the very haires of their <a id="l2220"></a>head are all numbred. Or as Saint Paul saith that they are sealed <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p080"> &lt;80&gt; </span> to the day of redemption: And therefore it is not to be doubted <a id="l2221"></a>but that these circumstances were intended to connect the beginning <a id="l2222"></a>of this vision  of the Temple with that of sealing &amp; numbring the <a id="l2223"></a>servants of God, &amp; so to fix it at the beginning of the seventh Trum<a id="l2224"></a>pet.</p>
<p id="par195">M<sup>r</sup> Mede extends this vision yet higher, even to the be<a id="l2225"></a>ginning of the first seale, supposing that it ought to re<a id="l2226"></a>turn to the highest Epocha becaus it is a regress of Pro<a id="l2227"></a>phesy. That it is a regress of Prophesy  was proved  above Posit 2. 3. But I see no reason why it should return higher then <a id="l2233"></a>to the beginning of the last seale, since the book contein<a id="l2234"></a>ing it is but a little one, &amp; the seven Thunders which <a id="l2235"></a>are also a distinct Prophesy introduced together with this book, <a id="l2236"></a>do yet return no higher. Yea to extend it upward to that <a id="l2237"></a>period &amp; no higher is altogether agreeable to the method <a id="l2238"></a>of the narration, as will appear by considering the reason <a id="l2239"></a>&amp; design of this regression, which doubtles was to insert <a id="l2240"></a>such things as were proper for connecting the vision of <a id="l2241"></a>the seales &amp; Trumpets with that of the Dragon &amp; Beast, <a id="l2242"></a>which things although contemporary with the Trumpets <a id="l2243"></a>yet could not be declared together with them, becaus <a id="l2244"></a>continued through them all without being interrupted and <a id="l2245"></a>distinguished into parts answering to each Trumpet. And <a id="l2246"></a>therefore as Historians when they have two contempo<a id="l2247"></a>rary subjects which cannot be conveniently related together, discours <a id="l2248"></a>first of one till they come to some remarkable period <a id="l2249"></a>common to them both &amp; then return to bring down the other <a id="l2250"></a>to the same period before they proceed; so here Saint Iohn <a id="l2251"></a>having related the fate of the church &amp; Empire together <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p081"> &lt;81&gt; </span> under the first six seales, when he comes at the seventh <a id="l2252"></a>he makes a notable breach by interposing the seventh <a id="l2253"></a>chapter conteining the vision of the sealed saints, as if it <a id="l2254"></a>were to cut of the following visions from those of the six <a id="l2255"></a>preceding Seales, &amp; there divides the narration, &amp; first <a id="l2256"></a>declares the fate of the Empire unto the common period <a id="l2257"></a>of that &amp; the obscured Church &amp; then returns to declare <a id="l2258"></a>the fate of the Church to the same period: after which <a id="l2259"></a>he proceeds in the joint description of both together shew<a id="l2260"></a>ing the downfall of the one &amp; victory of the other at <a id="l2261"></a>the sounding of the seventh Trumpet.</p>
<p id="par196">And that this is the scope of the Prophesy of the little <a id="l2262"></a>Book is evident in that it is introduced before that of the <a id="l2263"></a>sealed Book is ended, &amp; so is interwoven with it. ffor <a id="l2264"></a>although the narration of the first six Trumpets was <a id="l2265"></a>fully completed, as appears by ch 10.6, 7, where it is <a id="l2266"></a>said that there  should be time no longer but in the days <a id="l2267"></a>of the voice of the seventh  Angel when he shall <a id="l2268"></a>begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished: yet <a id="l2269"></a>the narration of the sounding of that Angel was deferred <a id="l2270"></a>untill Saint Iohn had related this Prophesy of the little <a id="l2271"></a>Book, ch 11.14, 15. So that this prophesy is inserted into <a id="l2272"></a>that of the sealed book, like a Parenthesis within a <a id="l2273"></a>sentence.</p>
<p id="par197">And for this reason I extend this of the little Book <a id="l2274"></a>onely to the first thirteen verses of chap 11, &amp; not with M<sup>r</sup> Mede to the <a id="l2275"></a>end of the Apocalyps; considering that the sounding of the 7<sup>th</sup> Trumpet is a return to the contents of the sealed Book &amp; so must break off the Prophesy of the other Book, &amp; that that other book  is called but a <a id="l2276"></a>little book, that is a book conteining but a little Prophesy <a id="l2277"></a>&amp; that it is said to be sweet in Saint Iohn's mouth &amp; <a id="l2278"></a>bitter in his belly, that is, to begin  with the comfortable <a id="l2280"></a>description of measuring the Temple &amp; Altar &amp; them that <a id="l2281"></a>worship therein, signifying God's care for his elect; but <a id="l2282"></a>from thence to the end to contein a description of the <a id="l2283"></a>worst of times during the 42 Months: whereas if it be extend<a id="l2284"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p082"> &lt;82&gt; </span>ed beyond that to the end of the Apocalyps, it would on <a id="l2285"></a>the contrary be most sweet in his belly by reason of the <a id="l2286"></a>joyfull times described in the seventh Trumpet, &amp; more at <a id="l2287"></a>large in the three last chapters, &amp; in comparison thereof <a id="l2288"></a>bitter in his mouth as beginning with the afflicted state of <a id="l2289"></a>the Church militant under the Seales &amp; first six Trumpets.</p>

<h2 id="hd24" class="cent">PROP.  XI. <a id="l2290"></a><br>The hundred &amp; forty four thousand sealed <a id="l2291"></a>Servants of God are extended from the be<a id="l2292"></a>ginning of the seventh seale to the  death of the Witnesses; &amp;  the Palm-bearing multitude <a id="l2295"></a>from  their resurrection to the utter ruin of the Beast.</h2>
<p id="par198">And 1 the 144000 begin with the seventh seale. ffor al<a id="l2296"></a>though they are set before it, yet as I signified above they are referred to it <a id="l2297"></a>by being introduced with the vision of the four Angels which <a id="l2298"></a>were to hurt the earth &amp; the sea at the sounding of the <a id="l2299"></a>Trumpets. For in these Prophesies it is the Method of the <a id="l2300"></a>holy Ghost when two contemporary subjects are to be <a id="l2301"></a>related successively, thus to interweave them least they <a id="l2302"></a>should be taken for successive things. And were it not <a id="l2303"></a>for this end, the vision of the four Angels ought to have <a id="l2304"></a>been separate from that of the sealed saints &amp; inserted into the seventh seale to which it belongs.</p>
<p id="par199">But for the  distincter understanding the connexion of <a id="l2305"></a>these visions,  you may consider the following particulars. <a id="l2306"></a>ffirst that the silence in heaven for about the space of half an hower is <a id="l2307"></a>the intervall between the beginning of the seventh seale &amp; the <a id="l2308"></a>beginning of the first Trumpet wherein the Angel offered in<a id="l2309"></a>cens with the prayers of the saints upon the golden Altar. <a id="l2310"></a>For I extend this time of silence through all that inter<a id="l2311"></a>vall, becaus the circumstances of this vision are taken from the <a id="l2312"></a>service of the Iews, &amp; it was their custome to be silent <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p083"> &lt;83&gt; </span> <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>during<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the time of Incense. Secondly the first appearance of <a id="l2313"></a>the seven Angels which were to sound is at the very opening <a id="l2314"></a>of the seventh seale becaus it precedes the time of incens <a id="l2315"></a>&amp; consequently is at the beginning of the half hower's si<a id="l2316"></a>lence. Thirdly the first appearance of the four Angels <a id="l2317"></a>is contemporary with that of the seven. ffor to suppose this <a id="l2318"></a>is most natural becaus they  belong collaterally to <a id="l2319"></a>the  same vision of the Trumpets. It is also contrary to the order of the <a id="l2320"></a>narration to put them later, &amp; were they earlier they <a id="l2321"></a>would interfere with the sixt seale. ffourthly the for<a id="l2322"></a>bidding of these Angels to hurt the earth &amp; the sea till <a id="l2323"></a>the servants of God were sealed implies that they were <a id="l2324"></a>to hurt the earth &amp; the sea immediately after, &amp; con<a id="l2325"></a>sequently the time of sealing must be extended to the <a id="l2326"></a>first Trumpet wherein they begin to hurt the earth; that <a id="l2327"></a>is, coextended to the half hower's silence. ffiftly whereas <a id="l2328"></a>the four Angels hold the four winds of the earth that the <a id="l2329"></a>wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor <a id="l2330"></a>on any tree, that  is during the time of sealing: <a id="l2331"></a>the serenity &amp; stilness of that time is a further argument of <a id="l2332"></a>its coincidence with the half howers silence **.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the right margin &gt; </span> ** &amp; that not onely by the similitude of the things, but also by the agreement of their signification ffor both signify a suspension of the following war: the stilness of the winds by Def <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; the silence in heaven as being a suspension of the noises, that is, of the voices &amp; thunders &amp; trumpets which introduced that war.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from p 83 resumes &gt; </span> And <a id="l2333"></a>lastly the blessing of being sealed suits best with the time <a id="l2334"></a>wherein the sacrifice of their prayers is mutually offer<a id="l2335"></a>ed to God. For this passage is like that in Ezekiel: And the Lord said unto the Angel: Go through the midst of Ierusalem &amp; set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh &amp; cry for the abominations that are done in the midst thereof. Ezek 9.4.</p>
<p id="par200">2 The sealed saints are extended downward into the <a id="l2336"></a>Trumpets. ffor by forbidding the four Angels  to <a id="l2337"></a> hurt the earth &amp; the sea till the servants of <a id="l2338"></a>God were sealed, this sealing is represented as a pro<a id="l2339"></a>tection of them from the evil of the following times. <a id="l2340"></a>And afterward in the fift Trumpet by calling the <a id="l2341"></a>Worshippers of the Beast the men that have not the seale <a id="l2342"></a>of God in their foreheads to distinguish them from the saints <a id="l2343"></a>which are their contemporaries, it is plainly signified that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p084"> &lt;84&gt; </span> those saints are of the numbers of the sealed ones. So in that the 144000 are called Virgins &amp; said not to be defiled with women ch 14 it is as much as to say that they have escaped committing fornication with the Whore. And therefore they must have been her contemporaries.</p>
<p id="par201">3 The sealed saints are the true church extended <a id="l2344"></a>downward even to the  death of the witnesses. <a id="l2345"></a>That they are the true Church is evident by their <a id="l2346"></a>being sealed in opposition to them that receive the mark <a id="l2347"></a>of the Beast, &amp; called the servants of God &amp; the twelve <a id="l2348"></a>tribes of the children of Israel. And that they are for some time at least con<a id="l2349"></a>temporary to the  <a id="l2350"></a>measured Temple &amp; to the woman in the Wildernes is <a id="l2351"></a>evident by Prop 17 partic 4 &amp; Prop 10 partic 4; &amp; also by Prop <a id="l2352"></a>16, considering that they are extended downward at least <a id="l2353"></a>to the fift trumpet as was newly shown. And therefore <a id="l2354"></a>since there is but one true church these sealed saints <a id="l2355"></a>must be the same with the Temple &amp; Woman, &amp; by <a id="l2356"></a>consequence equally extended downward with them, that <a id="l2357"></a>is to the  death of the witnesses. For till then the <a id="l2358"></a>woman is in the wilderness &amp; the holy City troden under <a id="l2359"></a>foot. Prop 16.</p>

<span class="pagenumber" id="p085"> &lt;85&gt; </span>
<p id="par203">4. The Palm-bearing multitude are extended from the <a id="l2375"></a>resurrection of the witnesses to the utter ruin of the Beast. For <a id="l2376"></a>these immediately follow the sealed saints as is manifest by the <a id="l2377"></a>order of the visions &amp; therefore begin at the resurrection of the <a id="l2378"></a>Witnesses. And beyond the utter ruin of the Beast they ex<a id="l2379"></a>tend not becaus after that there is no more time for them <a id="l2380"></a>to be in, ch 10.6, 7. &amp; 1 Thes: 2.8. Their number ch. 7.9 is greater <a id="l2381"></a>then can consist with the reign of the Beast whilst prosper<a id="l2382"></a>ous, &amp; their great tribulation (ch 7.14) is less consistent with <a id="l2383"></a>the times after his ruin when the kingdoms of the world are <a id="l2384"></a>become the kingdoms of Christ for ever. But in the inter<a id="l2385"></a>mediate time the great prevailing of true religion signi<a id="l2386"></a>fied by the ascention of the witnesses up to heaven who be<a id="l2387"></a>fore prophesied onely in sackcloth, &amp; by the cloud in which they ascended, that is by a great multitude of beleivers, Def 29 &amp; 42 &amp; by the preaching of the <a id="l2388"></a>everlasting gospel to every nation &amp; tongue &amp; Kindred &amp; <a id="l2389"></a>people ch 14.6,<sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup>  &amp; interdicting the worship of the Beast &amp; <a id="l2390"></a>his Image vers 9; does argue the  great multi<a id="l2391"></a>tude of its Professors: And at that time also is to be <a id="l2392"></a>the greatest tribulation that ever was in the world or ever <a id="l2393"></a>shal be. Mat 24.29, 30.<sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup>  Dan 12.1, insomuch that Saint Iohn <a id="l2394"></a>saith of that time: Here is the patience of the saints here <a id="l2395"></a>are they that keep the commandments of  God &amp; the faith <a id="l2396"></a>of Iesus. And both this great number of true Christians <a id="l2397"></a>&amp; great tribulation  are necessarily conjoyned <a id="l2398"></a>with the times of the ruin of the Beast, the one to cause his ruin <a id="l2399"></a>&amp; the other to be caused by him in the conflict before he <a id="l2400"></a>be ruined. And therefore the Palm-bearing multitude <a id="l2401"></a>by reason of the greatness of their number &amp; tribula<a id="l2402"></a>tion, &amp; they onely can suit with these times.</p>
<p id="par204">The same may be further argued from the contents <a id="l2403"></a>of the 19<sup>th</sup> Chapter. For in vers 1 &amp; 6 there is described <a id="l2404"></a>such another great multitude preceding the ruin of the <a id="l2405"></a>Beast &amp; singing Allelujah at the judgment of the Whore <a id="l2406"></a>which doubtless are the same with the Palm-bearing multitude. <a id="l2407"></a>For they agree in the greatness of the multitude, the one <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p086"> &lt;86&gt; </span> being termed a great multitude which no man could number <a id="l2408"></a>of all nations &amp; kindreds &amp; peoples &amp; tongues ch 7.9, &amp; the other <a id="l2409"></a>much people, &amp; many  waters, that is Nations <a id="l2410"></a>ch 19.1, 6. They agree also in their manner of worship<a id="l2411"></a>ing, the one standing before the Throne &amp; saying Salvation to our God &amp;c. And the other in heaven saying Sal<a id="l2412"></a>vation &amp; glory &amp; honour &amp; power unto the lord our God, <a id="l2413"></a>&amp; when they thus sang praises the heavenly Host also that <a id="l2414"></a>was about the Throne fell down &amp; worshipped God, ch <a id="l2415"></a>7.10, 11 &amp; ch 19.1, 4. And lastly they agree in their white <a id="l2416"></a>clothing. ffor the palm-bearing Multitude were clothed <a id="l2417"></a>in <em class="underline">white</em> ch 7.9, &amp; the other multitude sang that the mar<a id="l2418"></a>riage of the Lamb was come &amp; his wife (i.e. the present <a id="l2419"></a>Church or multitude that sang) hath made her self ready, <a id="l2420"></a>&amp; to her was granted that shee should be arrayed in <a id="l2421"></a>fine linnen clean &amp; <em class="underline">white</em> ch 19.8. And so it is <a id="l2422"></a>said that the Armies which were in heaven following the <a id="l2423"></a>King upon <em class="underline">white</em> horses clothed in fine linnen <em class="underline">white</em> &amp; <a id="l2424"></a>cleane ch 19.14: which armies doubtless belong to the same <a id="l2425"></a>multitude because the one conquered the Beast vers 19; <a id="l2426"></a>&amp; the other rejoyced at the judgment of the whore, <a id="l2427"></a>vers 2. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from inline &gt; </span>These are therefore the Palmbearing multitude, &amp; these fall in with the times wherein the Whore &amp; Beast are overthrown.</p>
<p id="par205">To conclude, the death of the Witnesses is a breach &amp; the onely breach made in the continuity of the Church, &amp; this distinguishes her into two such parts as are represented by the sealed Saints &amp; Palm-bearing multitude, &amp; therefore these must fall in with one another.</p>

<h2 id="hd25" class="cent">PROP.  XII. <a id="l2428"></a><br>The time from the beginning of the seventh <a id="l2429"></a>seale to the beginning of the seventh <a id="l2430"></a>Trumpet is but one &amp; the same continued <a id="l2431"></a>Apostacy which arrives to a greater height <a id="l2432"></a>at the beginning of the fift  Trumpet, &amp; at the <a id="l2433"></a> greatest height at the death of the Witnesses <a id="l2434"></a>&amp; after their resurrection declines gradu<a id="l2435"></a>ally untill first the great City Babylon be <a id="l2436"></a>ruined &amp; a while after all the Nations which <a id="l2437"></a>gave their Kingdom to it be overthrown <a id="l2438"></a>with an exceeding great slaughter.</h2>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p087"> &lt;87&gt; </span>
<p id="par206">1. There is no Apostacy nor Eclips of the Church before the <a id="l2439"></a>Seventh Seale. ffor in the four first seales there is nothing <a id="l2440"></a>which respects the Church unless it be the victoriousness of her head <a id="l2441"></a>in the first. In the fift seale indeed she suffers a great persecution <a id="l2442"></a>but that is the greatest preservative against an Apostacy &amp; produced <a id="l2443"></a>her triumph over Gentilism with the description of which the sixt seal <a id="l2444"></a>is taken up. So in the contemporary Prophesy of Chap 12 the Wo<a id="l2445"></a>man appeares gloriously adorned with the Sun Moon &amp; Stars &amp; <a id="l2446"></a>suffers no obscuration or detriment by the Dragon till after he <a id="l2447"></a>was cast out of heaven into the earth which was not complet<a id="l2448"></a>ed till the end of the sixt Trumpet. This is all in the Apo<a id="l2449"></a>calyps which precedes the seventh Trumpet, &amp; in all this there <a id="l2450"></a>is nothing of Apostacy or obscuration of the Church, but directly <a id="l2451"></a>the contrary.</p>
<p id="par207">2. There begins an Apostacy at the seventh seale. For <a id="l2452"></a>then the saints sending up their prayers are sealed against the evill times to come (see Ezek 9.4), then <a id="l2453"></a>the Dragon begins to persecute the woman &amp; she to fly into the <a id="l2454"></a>Wilderness, then the Beast  her grand enemy rises up &amp; men <a id="l2455"></a>begin to worship his Image &amp; receive his mark, &amp; for this <a id="l2456"></a>overspreading of wickedness God prepares the judgments of the <a id="l2457"></a>Trumpets &amp; Vials &amp; inflicts them on the Beast &amp; his Worshippers, </p>
<p id="par208">3 The Apostacy ceases at the beginning of the seventh Trumpet. <a id="l2458"></a>ffor then the Beast &amp; ffals Prophet are destroyed &amp; the Dragon shut up, &amp; <a id="l2459"></a>the Kingdoms of the world become the Kingdoms of God &amp; of his Christ <a id="l2460"></a>&amp; he reigns for ever &amp; ever.</p>
<p id="par209">4 The time from the beginning of the seventh Seal to the <a id="l2461"></a>end of the sixt Trumpet is but one &amp; the same continued Apostacy. <a id="l2462"></a>For the better understanding of  this you may consider these things. <a id="l2463"></a>ffirst that this is the adequate time of the existence of the beast <a id="l2464"></a>from his beginning to ascend out of the bottomles pit &amp; in all this time his Image is worshipped &amp; his mark received <a id="l2465"></a>secondly that at the beginning of this time the woman begins <a id="l2466"></a>her flight into the wilderness &amp; comes not out again till the <a id="l2467"></a>end of it. It is but one &amp; the same continued persecution of <a id="l2468"></a>her by the same Dragon from the beginning to the end. Tis <a id="l2469"></a>true the earth helps her for some time against the Dragon <a id="l2470"></a>but this is not so as to rescue her out of the Wilderness but <a id="l2471"></a>onely to preserve her from being quite overwhelmed &amp; car<a id="l2472"></a>ried away of the flood: not to better her condition but only <a id="l2473"></a>to save her from perishing. ffor after this she is in a wors <a id="l2474"></a>condition then before, having left but a remnant of her seed <a id="l2475"></a>&amp; those too still persecuted by the Dragon till the end. Thirdly <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p088"> &lt;88&gt; </span> the sealed Saints who stand in opposition to those that receive <a id="l2476"></a>the mark of the Beast &amp; were sealed all together at the very <a id="l2477"></a>beginning of the seventh seale, are extended through all this <a id="l2478"></a>time to the death of the witnesses. ffourthly this time is as it were <a id="l2479"></a>cut out of the continued series of the seales &amp; Trumpets <a id="l2480"></a>by the two notable breaches made at the beginning &amp; end of <a id="l2481"></a>it, I meane the seventh chapter which intercedes the sixt &amp; seventh seale &amp; the tenth &amp;  13 first verses of the <a id="l2482"></a>eleventh chapter which intercede the sixt &amp; seventh Trumpet. <a id="l2483"></a>These are a fence on both sides to inclose, &amp; to separate <a id="l2484"></a>this intermediate time from the times before &amp; after, &amp; may <a id="l2485"></a>be compared to the two terms of a Parenthesis which bound <a id="l2486"></a>&amp; include the words between them to distinguish them from <a id="l2487"></a>the rest. Nor do they onely include but like two bands <a id="l2488"></a>ty all the intermediate parts together; ffor they both run through <a id="l2489"></a>the whole &amp; so close with one another throughout; the palm-<a id="l2490"></a>bearing multitude falling in with the times after the resurrection <a id="l2491"></a>of the witnesses &amp; the measuring of the Temple with the sealing <a id="l2492"></a>of the saints. And it is yet a further  band of these <a id="l2493"></a>times that they are all allotted to the same seale &amp; to the <a id="l2494"></a>same head of the Dragon. And  further as if all this were <a id="l2495"></a>not enough to distinguish &amp; characterise them the Prophet <a id="l2496"></a>has described them by themselves in the vision of the Vials.</p>
<p id="par210">And indeed so notable are the times of this Apostacy <a id="l2497"></a>that the whole Apocalyps from the fourth chapter seems to have been written for the <a id="l2498"></a>sake of it. ffor the first six seales are but like an introduction <a id="l2499"></a>to give warning of these times approaching &amp; the 13 follow<a id="l2500"></a>ing chapters do all of them concern these times, some part <a id="l2501"></a>of the 12<sup>th</sup> chapter onely excepted. And these are the times <a id="l2502"></a>also which Daniel in no less then three of his visions (chap 7, 8, <a id="l2503"></a>11) has so long before described to be above all others exceed<a id="l2504"></a>ingly wicked.</p>
<p id="par211">He that hath ears to hear let him hear.</p>
<p id="par212">5. This Apostacy arrives to a greater height at the <a id="l2505"></a>beginning of the first Wo-trumpet. For then has the Earth  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p089"> &lt;89&gt; </span> done helping the Woman, &amp; she is fully hidden in the wilderness <a id="l2506"></a>having left but a remnant of her seed. Then the Gentiles take <a id="l2507"></a>full possession of the outward Court, &amp; the  two Witnesses <a id="l2508"></a>begin to prophesy in sackcloth, &amp; then Babylon gets upon her <a id="l2509"></a>Beast  &amp; begins to sing as an Harlot. <a id="l2510"></a>This is the beginning of the notable synchronism of the <a id="l2511"></a>1260 days wherein wickednes is at the height, the next <a id="l2512"></a>period only excepted.</p>
<p id="par213">6. This Apostacy arrives to the greatest height <a id="l2513"></a>at the killing of the Witnesses. ffor the warring with <a id="l2514"></a>the Witnesses toward the end of their prophesy argues wors <a id="l2515"></a>times then before the Beast began that  war with them, <a id="l2516"></a>&amp; the killing of them argues times still wors by the prosper<a id="l2517"></a>ing of wickedness; &amp; their enemies rejoicing over their dead <a id="l2518"></a>bodies, &amp; making merry &amp; sending gifts to one another <a id="l2519"></a>becaus of the ceasing of these two  Witnesses which torment<a id="l2520"></a>ed them,  is such a triumph as argues that they <a id="l2521"></a>are absolute &amp; universal victors over the truth, having <a id="l2522"></a>no more enemies left to torment them by standing up <a id="l2523"></a>for it.</p>
<p id="par214">I should now proceed to describe the fall of this Baby<a id="l2524"></a>lonian Kingdom as it is  graduated by these three <a id="l2525"></a>periods; the resurrection of the witnesses, the fall of Ba<a id="l2526"></a>bylon, &amp; the battel of the great day. But these things be<a id="l2527"></a>ing described at large in the 14<sup>th</sup> &amp; 19<sup>th</sup> Chapters, I shall <a id="l2528"></a>instead thereof show the connexion of those chapters with this <a id="l2529"></a>interval.</p>
<p id="par215">7. The 14<sup>th</sup> chapter is a description of the times between <a id="l2530"></a>the death of the witnesses &amp; the beginning of the seventh Trump<a id="l2531"></a>et. This will appear by comparing their contemporary parts <a id="l2532"></a>whereof the first is the vision of the Lamb with 144000 saints <a id="l2533"></a>on mount Sion,<sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup>  &amp; this suits best with the time of the death of the <a id="l2534"></a>Witnesses.<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup>  ffor these 144000 are the same with the sealed Saints <a id="l2535"></a>as may appear both by their equal number, &amp; by the seal in  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p090"> &lt;90&gt; </span> their foreheads which is here called the name of God, &amp; by the <a id="l2536"></a>coincidence of the times which they were to live in: ffor those <a id="l2537"></a>were to live in the times of the Beast untill the death of <a id="l2538"></a>the Witnesses, &amp; these are they that have lived in those <a id="l2539"></a>times; for they are called those which were redeemed from <a id="l2540"></a>the earth &amp; said to be virgins not defiled with Women, that <a id="l2541"></a>is not polluted with the abominations of the Whore of Babylon <a id="l2542"></a>These were therefore the Virgin Church represented by <a id="l2543"></a>the woman in the wilderness, but they are here represented as no longer <a id="l2544"></a>in the Wilderness but on Mount Sion,  as men that <a id="l2545"></a>are now redeemed from the earth &amp; for the future in fru<a id="l2546"></a>ition of the presence of the Lamb. This Vision is therefore <a id="l2547"></a>a representation of the accomplishment of the time of those <a id="l2548"></a>saints on earth &amp; so must fall in with the end of that <a id="l2549"></a>time.</p>
<p id="par216">There is also another character of this period. ffor in that <a id="l2550"></a>this chapter immediately succeeds the vision of the Beast who <a id="l2551"></a>is said to make war 42 Months; it falls in very fitly <a id="l2552"></a>with the end of those Months.</p>
<p id="par217">The next thing<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup>  is the vision of an Angel flying in the <a id="l2553"></a>midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto <a id="l2554"></a>them that dwell on the earth  even to every nation &amp; kindred <a id="l2555"></a>&amp; tongue &amp; people. And this preceding the fall of Babylon <a id="l2556"></a>must fall in with the resurrection of the Witnesses.<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup>  And indeed <a id="l2557"></a>they are the same thing: the two Witnesses being the two <a id="l2558"></a>Testaments  by which the will of God is testified to the world; their death the universal neglect <a id="l2560"></a>of them to rely upon humane authorities; their resurrection <a id="l2561"></a>&amp; ascention the reviving spreading &amp; great exaltation of their <a id="l2562"></a>authority; &amp; the cloud in which they ascended the great mul<a id="l2563"></a>titude of people (the Palm-bearing multitude which no man <a id="l2564"></a>could number) to be converted all the world over by this <a id="l2565"></a>reviving &amp; universal preaching of the Gospel. This is that <a id="l2566"></a>of which our Saviour said; This Gospel of the Kingdom shall <a id="l2567"></a>be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p092"> &lt;92&gt; </span> and then shall the end come. Matt 24.14.</p>
<p id="par218">After this Angel had preached saying Fear God &amp; give glory <a id="l2568"></a>to him, ffor the hower of his judgment is come, &amp;c. that is the hower <a id="l2569"></a>in which he will judg Babylon: there follows another Angel<sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup>  <a id="l2570"></a>proclaiming that  Babylon is fallen. And this answers <a id="l2571"></a>to the fall of the 10<sup>th</sup> part of the City,<sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup>  that is of the whole <a id="l2572"></a>city Babylon then standing, for it was thrown down by a shaking. <a id="l2573"></a>Not by an earthquake onely as it is usually translated, <a id="l2574"></a>but by a shaking of heaven &amp; earth, for so the word σεισμὸς <a id="l2575"></a> must be understood in these prophesies.  And this by Def <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> signifies <a id="l2576"></a>a political commotion so great as to overthrow a Kingdom &amp; <a id="l2577"></a>so can import nothing less then the fall of Babylon. And indeed what <a id="l2578"></a>els signify the next words [The remnant were affrighted &amp; gave glory <a id="l2579"></a>to God] but their glorifying God for judging Babylon.</p>
<p id="par219">Immediately after this<sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup>  there followed a third Angel prohibiting <a id="l2580"></a>the worship of the Beast &amp; his Image for the future: from whence <a id="l2581"></a>we may gather that the Beast was still in being &amp; had his wor<a id="l2582"></a>shippers. Though the City &amp; dominion of Babylon was at an end <a id="l2583"></a>the religion still continued among many. And this informs <a id="l2584"></a>us who those are that cause the further troubles of the <a id="l2585"></a>saints, concerning which Saint Iohn cries out in the next <a id="l2586"></a>words, <em class="underline">Here is the patience of the saints, here are they that <a id="l2587"></a>keep the commandments of God &amp; the faith of Iesus; &amp; who</em> <a id="l2588"></a>the ffroggs are which come out of the mouth of the Dragon<sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup>  <a id="l2589"></a>&amp; out of the mouth of the Beast &amp; out of the mouth of the <a id="l2590"></a>fals Prophet &amp; gather the whole world to the battel of the <a id="l2591"></a>great day.</p>
<p id="par220">The last thing is the harvest &amp; Vintage<sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup>  &amp; these fall <a id="l2592"></a>in with that battel of the great day.<sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup>  ffor the Winepress is an <a id="l2593"></a>emblem of slaughter by Def <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; the quantity of blood <a id="l2594"></a>which came out of the winepress even to the horsbridles by the <a id="l2595"></a>space of 1600 ffurlongs is an  indication of the exceed<a id="l2596"></a>ing greatness of the slaughter, &amp; that in Battel: ffor <a id="l2597"></a>what hors bridles are those but of horsmen in the battel. <a id="l2598"></a>**<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from p 91 &gt; </span> ** Yea that there may be no room for doubting you have in the nineteenth <a id="l2599"></a>chapter this treading of the winepress &amp; the great battel joyned together. ffor <a id="l2600"></a>when the Word of God upon the white hors led the armies of heaven to that <a id="l2601"></a>great battel, it is said of him that out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword <a id="l2602"></a>that with it he should smite the nations, &amp; that he treadeth the winepres of <a id="l2603"></a>the fiercenes &amp; wrath of God; &amp; then the battel is immediately described: <a id="l2604"></a>ffor further elucidation of the place you may compare it with Isa 63.2, 3. <a id="l2605"></a>which is a description of the same battel by the like treading of a winepress &amp;c. <a id="l2606"></a>which this place of Saint Iohn relates.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from p 92 resumes &gt; </span> This 14<sup>th</sup> chapter of the Apocalyps therefore ends with the great battel &amp; conse<a id="l2607"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p093"> &lt;93&gt; </span>quently with the  very beginning of the seventh Trumpet. ffor <a id="l2608"></a>immediately before the seventh Vial the armies of the whole <a id="l2609"></a>world are gathered together against this battel, &amp; at it's pouring <a id="l2610"></a>out their overthrow is described first by the expression <a id="l2611"></a><em class="underline">It is done</em> to signify the suddenness of it, &amp; then by the voices, <a id="l2612"></a>thunders, lightnings, shaking, hail, &amp; falling of the Cities of the <a id="l2613"></a>Nations, to express the action. And therefore since the 7<sup>th</sup> <a id="l2614"></a>Trumpet is coincident with this Vial it must begin at the <a id="l2615"></a>very battel, &amp; be as it were a sounding to the onset.</p>
<p id="par221">8. The 19<sup>th</sup> Chapter is a description of the times <a id="l2616"></a>between the falling of the 10<sup>th</sup> part of the City &amp; the be<a id="l2617"></a>ginning of the seventh Trumpet.  For The great battel <a id="l2618"></a>shows that it ends at the very beginning of the seventh <a id="l2619"></a>Trumpet; &amp; that it succeeds the fall of Babylon is manifest by <a id="l2620"></a>its beginning which runs thus. After these things (i.e. After the <a id="l2621"></a>fall of Babylon described at large in the former Chapter) I <a id="l2622"></a>heard a great voice of much people in heaven (i.e. the <a id="l2623"></a>Church) saying: Allelujah; salvation – to God – for he hath <a id="l2624"></a>judged the great Whore which did corrupt the earth with her <a id="l2625"></a>fornication, &amp; hath avenged the blood of his servants at her <a id="l2626"></a>hand, &amp; again they said Allelujah: &amp; her smoke ascendeth <a id="l2627"></a>up for ever &amp; ever. This Chapter therefore  <a id="l2628"></a>begins at the fall of Babylon &amp; so must fall in with the <a id="l2629"></a>time between that &amp; the seventh Trumpet.</p>
<p id="par222">And indeed the middle of the Chapter is also such as <a id="l2630"></a>can agree to no other time. ffor (not to repeat the consent of the great multitude with the Palm-bearing multitude) that multitude crying <a id="l2631"></a>the Lord omnipotent reigneth, argues it to be after <a id="l2632"></a>the reign of the Whore; &amp; the Lamb's wife being not <a id="l2633"></a>yet married but prepared against the day of marriage <a id="l2634"></a>argues it to be before the seventh Trumpet when the <a id="l2635"></a>Lamb, (as is described in the next words,) comes to vanquish <a id="l2636"></a>all her enemies &amp; marry her.</p>

<p id="par230">3 After the greatest decay of religion there is to be an <a id="l2664"></a>universal preaching of the Gospel immediately before the seventh <a id="l2665"></a>Trumpet Prop. <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.

<p id="par231">4 At the end of the sixt Trumpet the Angel sware that <em class="underline">there <a id="l2667"></a>should be time no longer, but at the voice of the seventh <a id="l2668"></a>Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God <a id="l2669"></a>should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the Prophets</em>. <a id="l2670"></a>Now here is a direct assertion of the end of the world in <a id="l2671"></a>these words that <em class="underline">there shall be time no longer</em>, &amp; this <a id="l2672"></a>further character of it, that the Mystery of God shall then <a id="l2673"></a>be finished: By which mystery  I see not what can <a id="l2674"></a>well be meant if not the resurrection of the saints &amp; <a id="l2675"></a>accomplishment of their happiness in Christ's Kingdom, <a id="l2676"></a>which according to the Prophets is to commence at his <a id="l2677"></a>second coming.</p>
