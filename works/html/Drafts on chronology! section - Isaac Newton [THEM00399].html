<p id="par1">The Egyptians seem to have been called Coptites <a id="l3"></a>from the Citizens of Coptus growing potent &amp; by degrees <a id="l4"></a>conquering all Egypt; &amp; of ἆια Κόφτι the Greeks <a id="l5"></a>formed the word Ægypt. For nations had their names <a id="l6"></a>originally from the Kings Cities &amp; Provinces which at first <a id="l7"></a>subdued &amp; reigned over them. While the shepherds reigned <a id="l8"></a>in the lower Egypt, the Coptites grew potent in Theba<a id="l9"></a>is, &amp; then conquering &amp; expelling the Shepherds  <a id="l10"></a>reduced all Egypt into one Monarchy; &amp; this was done by <a id="l11"></a>Thmosis or Amosis king of the Coptites about the same <a id="l12"></a>time that Saul began to reign over Israel as was shewed <a id="l13"></a>above, &amp; laid the foundation of a very great Empire, <a id="l14"></a>the successors of Thmosis conquering all the nations <a id="l15"></a>round about. Thomosis may be therefore recconed the <a id="l16"></a>founder of the Monarchy of Egypt, he being the first <a id="l17"></a>king in history who reigned over the whole. He reigned <a id="l18"></a>after the expulsion of the shepherds 25 years &amp; 4 months <a id="l19"></a>according to Manetho, &amp; by consequence died about the <a id="l20"></a>12<sup>th</sup> or 15<sup>th</sup> year of David.</p>
<p id="par2">When David smote Edom<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>(which was about the 16<sup>th</sup> <a id="l21"></a>year of his reign as above) the king of Edom's servants <a id="l22"></a>fled into Egypt with Hadad a little child of the kings <a id="l23"></a>seed, &amp; Pharaoh gave Hadad a house &amp; victuals &amp; land &amp; <a id="l24"></a>Hadad found great favour in the sight of the Pharaoh so <a id="l25"></a>that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife <a id="l26"></a>Taphenes the Queen. And the sister of Taphenes bare <a id="l27"></a>him Genubath, &amp; Genubath was in Pharaohs' house among <a id="l28"></a>the sons of Pharaoh untill the death of David. Whence <a id="l29"></a>it appears that this King of Egypt was of about the <a id="l30"></a>same age with Hadad &amp; began his reign before Hadad <a id="l31"></a>fled from David being then very young &amp; therefore suc<a id="l32"></a>ceeded Thmosis, &amp; that at the death of David he had <a id="l33"></a>a family of young children contemporary to Genubath. <a id="l34"></a>Amongst these children I reccon Solomons young Spouse<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> <a id="l35"></a>the chief (or first born) of her mothers children, &amp; her <a id="l36"></a>little sister who by reason of her childhood had no <a id="l37"></a>breasts, &amp; her brother who sucked the breasts of her <a id="l38"></a>mother, &amp; to whom she wishes Solomon were like <a id="l39"></a>that she might kiss him whenever she finds him, <a id="l40"></a>&amp; lead him &amp; bring him to her mothers house. And <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> of about the same age with these children was Se<a id="l41"></a>sak, so that he may be recconed among the sons of <a id="l42"></a>this king. For he led the armies of his father before <a id="l43"></a>his own reigne &amp; reigned in the days of Solomon &amp; Reho<a id="l44"></a>boam. And therefore the King of Egypt who succeeded <a id="l45"></a>Thmosis  was the father <a id="l46"></a>of Sesostris.</p>
<p id="par3">✝Manetho in his 11<sup>th</sup> &amp; 12<sup>th</sup> Dynasties &amp;c
<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 1v &gt; </span><sup>✝</sup>Manetho in his 11<sup>th</sup> &amp; 12<sup>th</sup> Dynasties, as he is cited by Africanus &amp; Eusebius <a id="l47"></a>names these four kings of Thebes as reigning in order. Ammenemes, <a id="l48"></a>Gesongoses or Sesonchoris the son of Ammenemes, Ammenemes who <a id="l49"></a>was slain by his Eunuchs &amp; Sesotris who subdued all Asia &amp; part of <a id="l50"></a>Europe. Gesongoses &amp; Sesonchoris are corruptly written for Sesonchosis <a id="l51"></a>&amp; the two first of these four kings Ammenemes &amp; Sesonchosis are <a id="l52"></a>the same with the two last Ammenemes &amp; Sesostris, that is with <a id="l53"></a>Ammon &amp; Sesak. For we have shewed that Sesonchosis Sesostris &amp; <a id="l54"></a>Sesak are the same. So then the three first Monarchs of Egypt <a id="l55"></a>were Thomosis Ammon &amp; Sesak.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 2r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par4"> Diodorus tells us<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> that the father of Sesostris <a id="l56"></a>gathered together out of all Egypt the male children <a id="l57"></a>who were born the same day with Sesostris &amp; placed <a id="l58"></a>them with nurses &amp; governours &amp; prescribed to them <a id="l59"></a>all the same form of education &amp; discipline being <a id="l60"></a>perswaded that they who were so brought up with <a id="l61"></a>his son would be most faithfull &amp; usefull to him <a id="l62"></a>in his wars. These children he brought up with exer<a id="l63"></a>cises of daily labours, commanding that none of them <a id="l64"></a>should eat till he had run 180 furlongs. By which means <a id="l65"></a>they became endued with strong &amp; active bodies &amp; <a id="l66"></a>great aspiring minds. Hence I gather that Ammon <a id="l67"></a>the father of Sesostris began his reign in Egypt before <a id="l68"></a> Sesostris (or Sesak) was born, &amp; by consequence <a id="l69"></a>in the reign of David as above, &amp; therefore he was <a id="l70"></a>that Pharaoh king of Egypt who married hos wifes <a id="l71"></a>sister to Hadad &amp; his daughter to Solomon &amp; took <a id="l72"></a>Gezar from the Canaanites &amp; gave it to his daugh<a id="l73"></a>ter for a present &amp; whose reign began a little <a id="l74"></a>before Hadad fled from David. And considering the <a id="l75"></a>age of his children he seems to have been about <a id="l76"></a>35 or 40 years old at the death of David.</p>
<p id="par5"><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup>After the shepherds were expelled by Thomosis or <a id="l77"></a>Amosis &amp; the Monarchy of Egypt was established at <a id="l78"></a>home, Ammon send an army under the command of his <a id="l79"></a>son Sesostris into Arabia (perhaps that Arabia which <a id="l80"></a>lyes between Egypt &amp; the red Sea) &amp; Sesostris accom<a id="l81"></a>panied with those who were brought up with him, <a id="l82"></a>destroyed the serpents, &amp; overcoming the want of water <a id="l83"></a>&amp; food conquered all that barbarous nation which till <a id="l84"></a>then had been unconquered. Then being sent against <a id="l85"></a>the nations which lay westward &amp; were not yet conquered by Ammon he subdued the greatest <a id="l86"></a>part of Libya altho hitherto a very youth. By the <a id="l87"></a>first of these conquests the Troglodytes &amp; some of <a id="l88"></a>the Arabic Ethiopians, by the latter  all Lybia as far as the <a id="l90"></a>river Triton or Capes, came under the dominion of Egypt. <a id="l91"></a>And this seems to have given occasion to the trafic of Solo<a id="l92"></a>mon into Egypt for horses. For Egypt was supplied with <a id="l93"></a>horses from Cyrene, a country famous for  breeding a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> multitude of good horses. Herodotus tells us<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> that the <a id="l94"></a>Ammonians being colonies of the Egyptians &amp; Ethiopi<a id="l95"></a>ans spake a language between them both, &amp; that the <a id="l96"></a>inhabitants as far as the river Triton used the Egyp<a id="l97"></a>tian manners but beyond that river lived much other <a id="l98"></a>wise. Ammon therefor  upon conquering this <a id="l99"></a>large region peopled it with colonies from Egypt &amp; called <a id="l100"></a>it Ammonia. For in those days it was very usuall to <a id="l101"></a>call peoples &amp; regions by the names of their first <a id="l102"></a>kings; &amp; Stephanus tell us<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> that the Mediterranean <a id="l103"></a>part of Libya &amp; even all Libya was called Ammo<a id="l104"></a>nia from Ammon. And tho Egypt kept its dominion <a id="l105"></a>only to the river Triton yet Sesostris seems to have <a id="l106"></a>gone westward to the furthest parts of Afric &amp; there <a id="l107"></a>to have erected pillars as he did in all his conquests<a id="l108"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="underline">Venit ad occasum, mundique extrema Sesostris.</em> Lucan. lib. 1.</p>

Strabo <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> speaking of <a id="l113"></a>the straits of the red sea at Dira a promontory of <a id="l114"></a>Ethiopia tells us that <em class="underline">a pillar of Sesostris the Egyptian <a id="l115"></a>was standing there, which in the sacred letters signified his <a id="l116"></a>passing over.

Dio<a id="l134"></a>dorus relates these conquests of Ethiopia &amp; Arabia fælix <a id="l135"></a>as made in the reign of Sesostris. But I suspect that <a id="l136"></a>they were made in the reign of his father Ammon <a id="l137"></a>because Ammon was worshipped as a God in all these <a id="l138"></a>countries <a id="l139"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="underline">Quamvis Æthiopum populis Arabumque beatis</em> <a id="l140"></a><br><span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="underline">Gentibus atque Indis unus sit Iupiter Ammon</em>.

<p id="par7">After these conquests &amp; the invasion of the sea <a id="l141"></a>coasts on both sides the mediterranean as fas as <a id="l142"></a>the straits mouth,<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup><em class="underline">Sesak in the fift year of Rehobo<a id="l143"></a>am came out of Egypt with 1200 chariots &amp; 60000 <a id="l144"></a>horsmen &amp; foot without number of Libyans Tro<a id="l145"></a>glodytes &amp; Ethiopians &amp; took the fenced cities of <a id="l146"></a>Iudah &amp; came to Ierusalem.

For Dionysius<sup class="note" id="n83-ref">[83]</sup> speaking <a id="l700"></a>of the Amazons who were seated at Thermodon tells <a id="l701"></a>us that they dwelt originally in Libya &amp; there reigned <a id="l702"></a>over the Atlantides a potent nation &amp; invading their <a id="l703"></a>neighbours conquered as far as Europe &amp; built many <a id="l704"></a>cities there.

<p id="par48">In the time of this Empire of the Gods of Egypt, the <a id="l1309"></a>Oracles of the heathens had their rise. The oldest Oracle <a id="l1310"></a>in history was that in the royal city of Thebes, the next <a id="l1311"></a>was erected in Libya, the third at Dodona in Greece: all three of Iupiter. Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n175-ref">[175]</sup> was told by the Priests of the <a id="l1312"></a>Theban Iupiter that two weomen Priestesses were carried <a id="l1313"></a>from thence, the one into Libya the other into Greece <a id="l1314"></a>&amp; erected the first Oracles in those countries. These <a id="l1315"></a>were the Oracles of Iupiter Ammon &amp; Iupiter Do<a id="l1316"></a>donæus. He was told also by the chief Priestesses of Dodo<a id="l1317"></a>na that two black Doves flew from the Egyptian Thebes <a id="l1318"></a>the one to them which sitting upon a beach tree spake <a id="l1319"></a>with a humane voice that an Oracle should be erected <a id="l1320"></a>there to Iupiter, &amp; the other to the Libyans which com<a id="l1321"></a>manded them to erect an Oracle to Iupiter Ammon. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p031r"> &lt;31r&gt; </span> Doves in the ancient  fables of the Greeks are put for Priestesses, <a id="l1322"></a>as Bochart, Marsham &amp; Potter have shewed.<sup class="note" id="n176-ref">[176]</sup> And, saith Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n177-ref">[177]</sup>, <a id="l1323"></a>the Oracle at Dodona is the oldest in Greece &amp; is very like that <a id="l1324"></a>at the Egyptian Thebes, &amp; the way of divining in Temples came <a id="l1325"></a>from Egypt. Oracles were set up by Politicians for giving divinity <a id="l1326"></a>to dead men &amp; laws to the living. Zaleucus pretended to receive <a id="l1327"></a>his laws from the Goddess Vesta, Nuna his from the Goddess Ege<a id="l1328"></a>ria, Minos his from the Cretan Iupiter, Lycurgus backt his<sup class="note" id="n178-ref">[178]</sup> <a id="l1329"></a>by the authority of the Delphic Oracle. When Acrisius erected <a id="l1330"></a>the Amphictyonic Council &amp; a Temple was built at Delphos for <a id="l1331"></a>them to meet in, the Temple was furnished with an Oracle not <a id="l1332"></a>for governing the Council but for influencing the people &amp; <a id="l1333"></a>for bringing wealth to the Temple &amp; credit to the God. And the <a id="l1334"></a>same is to be understood of all the Oracles in temples built by <a id="l1335"></a>publick authority, such as were the temple of Iupiter  Ammon in Libya, built by Dariaus in the reign of his <a id="l1337"></a>brother Sesostris or by Sesostris himself &amp; as many of the temples of the Nomes or <a id="l1338"></a>Provinces of Egypt as had Oracles in them. For Sesostris divided Egypt into <a id="l1339"></a>36 Nomes &amp; built a temple for every Nome or Church &amp; all <a id="l1340"></a>these  Temples had their Councils of Senators or Elders who <a id="l1341"></a>met at set times of the year to consult of &amp; regulate the <a id="l1342"></a>affairs of the Nome &amp; Temple; the people of the Nome also <a id="l1343"></a>coming together to sacrifice &amp; feast &amp; buy &amp; sell. For the <a id="l1344"></a>several Nomes had their several Gods &amp; several ways of <a id="l1345"></a>worshipping their Gods &amp; these Gods had their Oracles some of <a id="l1346"></a>which continued in vogue till the days of Herodotus, as the <a id="l1347"></a>Oracles of Hercules &amp; Apollo in their cities, that of Minerva <a id="l1348"></a>in the city Sais, that of Diana in the city Bubastis, that <a id="l1349"></a>of Mars in the city Pampremis, that of Iupiter in Thebes &amp; <a id="l1350"></a>those of Apis &amp; Serapis in their temples; but of all the <a id="l1351"></a>Oracles that of Latona in the city Buti remained most <a id="l1352"></a>in repute. And these Oracles were not all alike, but delivered <a id="l1353"></a>themselves in different manners. And indeed I do not see how <a id="l1354"></a>Sesostris could have set up so many Gods &amp; so many religions <a id="l1355"></a>in Egypt as there were Nomes &amp; Temples, if he had not furnished <a id="l1356"></a>the temple of every Nome with an Oracle in the beginning.</p>

By all these circumstances it is manifest <a id="l1453"></a>that these Gods lived in the ages between Cecrops &amp; <a id="l1454"></a>Theseus &amp; that the wars which Sesostris made upon the <a id="l1455"></a>nations by land &amp; sea &amp; the conquest of all the coasts of the mediterranean by his fleet except Greece  &amp; the invasion <a id="l1456"></a>of Egypt by   Neptune are here described &amp; how afer <a id="l1457"></a>the death of Sesostris his captains shared his con<a id="l1458"></a>quests among themselves (as the captains of Alexander <a id="l1459"></a>the great did his conquests long after) &amp; instituting <a id="l1460"></a>Temples &amp; Priests &amp; sacred rites to themselves caused them<a id="l1461"></a>selves to be worshipped as Gods, &amp; that the island <a id="l1462"></a>Gadir or Gades was a part of the lot of Neptune. <a id="l1463"></a>For there Homer<sup class="note" id="n195-ref">[195]</sup> places Calypso the daughter of Atlas <a id="l1464"></a>a little after the Trojan war when Vlysses being ship<a id="l1465"></a>wrackt escaped thither. Homer calls it the Ogygian <a id="l1466"></a>island &amp; places it 18 or 20 days sail westward from the <a id="l1467"></a>island  Pheacia or Corcyra. And so many <a id="l1468"></a>days sail Gades is from Corcyra, recconing with the <a id="l1469"></a>ancients about a thousand stadia to a days sail. <a id="l1470"></a>This Island is by Homes described a small one destitute of <a id="l1471"></a>shipping &amp; cities &amp; inhabited only by Calypso &amp; her <a id="l1472"></a>weomen who dwelt in a cave in the middle of a wood, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p034r"> &lt;34r&gt; </span> there being no men in the island to assist Vlysses in building <a id="l1473"></a>a new ship or to accompany him from thence to Corcyra: <a id="l1474"></a>which description of the island agrees to Gades. And the time <a id="l1475"></a>when the Gods made war &amp; shared the earth &amp; caused <a id="l1476"></a>themselves to be worshipped as Gods is by Solon limited <a id="l1477"></a>to the age of Neptune the brother of Sesostris &amp; grand<a id="l1478"></a>father of Calypso &amp; so was but two generations before <a id="l1479"></a>the destruction of Troy or about 400 years before <a id="l1480"></a>Solon went into Egypt. But the Priests of Egypt in <a id="l1481"></a>those 400 years had magnified the stories &amp; antiquity <a id="l1482"></a>of their Gods so exceedingly as to make them nine <a id="l1483"></a>thousand years older then Solon &amp; the island Atlantis <a id="l1484"></a>bigger then all Afric &amp; Asia together &amp; full of <a id="l1485"></a>people. And because in the days of Solon this great <a id="l1486"></a>island did not appear they pretended that it was <a id="l1487"></a>sunk into the sea with all its people. Thus great <a id="l1488"></a>was the vanity of the Priests of Egypt in magnifying their antiquities.</p>
