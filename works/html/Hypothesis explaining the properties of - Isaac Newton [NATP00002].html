<h2 id="hd1" class="left"><em>December</em> 9. There was produced a manuscript of Mr. NEWTON, touching <a id="l1"></a>his theory of light and colors, containing partly an hypothesis to explain the <a id="l2"></a>properties of light discoursed of by him in his former papers, partly the principal <a id="l3"></a>phænomena of the various colours exhibited by thin plates or bubbles, esteemed <a id="l4"></a>by him to be of a more difficult consideration; yet to depend also on the said <a id="l5"></a>properties of light.</h2>
<h2 id="hd2" class="left">Of the hypothesis only the first part was read, giving an account of refraction, <a id="l6"></a>reflection, transparency, and opacity; the second part explaining colours being <a id="l7"></a>referred to the next meeting.</h2>
<p id="par1">The first was as follows<sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> :</p>
<p id="par2">Sir,</p>
<p id="par3">I have sent you the papers I mentioned, by JOHN STILES. Upon reviewing <a id="l8"></a>them, I find some things so obscure, as might have deserved a further explication <a id="l9"></a>by schemes; and some other things, I guess, will not be new to you, though al<a id="l10"></a>most all was new to me when I wrote them. But as they are, I hope you will accept <a id="l11"></a>of them, though not worth the ample thanks you sent. I remember, in some <a id="l12"></a>discourse with Mr. HOOKE, I happened to say, that I thought light was re<a id="l13"></a>flected, not by the parts of glass, water, air, or other sensible bodies; but by <a id="l14"></a>the same confine or superficies of the æthereal mediums, which refracts it, the <a id="l15"></a>rays finding some difficulty to get through it in passing out of the denser into <a id="l16"></a>the rarer medium, and a greater difficulty in passing out of the rarer into the <a id="l17"></a>denser; and so being either refracted or reflected by that superficies, as the <a id="l18"></a>circumstances they happened to be in at their incidence make them able or <a id="l19"></a>unable to get through it. And, for confirmation of this, I said further, that <a id="l20"></a>I thought the reflection of light, as its tending out of glass into air, would not <a id="l21"></a>be diminished or weakened by drawing away the air in an air-pump, as it ought <a id="l22"></a>to be, if they were the parts of air that reflected: and added, that I had not <a id="l23"></a>tried this experiment, but though he was not unacquainted with notions of <a id="l24"></a>this kind. To which he replied, that the notion was not new, and he would the <a id="l25"></a>first opportunity try the experiment I propounded. But upon reviewing the <a id="l26"></a>papers I send you, I found it there set down for tried; which makes me recol<a id="l27"></a>lect, that about the time I was writing these papers, I had occasionally observed <a id="l28"></a>in an air-pump here at Christ's College, that I could not perceive the reflection <a id="l29"></a>of the inside of the glass diminished in drawing out the air. This I thought <a id="l30"></a>fit to mention, least my former forgetfulness, through having long laid aside <a id="l31"></a>my thoughts on these things, should make me seem to have set down for cer<a id="l32"></a>tain what I never tried.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p248"> &lt;248&gt; </span>
<p id="par4">Sir, I had formerly purposed never to write any hypothesis of light and <a id="l33"></a>colours, fearing it might be a means to engage me in vain disputes: but I hope <a id="l34"></a>a declared resolution to answer nothing, that looks like a controversy, unless <a id="l35"></a>possibly at my own time upon some by-occasion, may defend me from that <a id="l36"></a>fear. And therefore considering, that such an hypothesis would much illustrate <a id="l37"></a>the papers I promised to send you; and having a little time this last week to <a id="l38"></a>spare, I have not scrupled to describe one, so far as I could on a sudden recol<a id="l39"></a>lect my thoughts about it; not concerning myself, whether it shall be thought <a id="l40"></a>probable or improbable, so it do but render the papers I send you, and others <a id="l41"></a>sent formerly, more intelligible. You may see, by the scratching and inter<a id="l42"></a>lining, it was done in haste; and I have not had time to get it transcribed, <a id="l43"></a>which makes me say I reserve a liberty of adding it; and desire, that you would <a id="l44"></a>return those and the other papers when you have done with them. I doubt <a id="l45"></a>there is too much to be read at one time, but you will soon know how to <a id="l46"></a>order that. At the end of the hypothesis you will see a paragraph to be in<a id="l47"></a>serted as is there directed: I should have added another or two, but I had not <a id="l48"></a>time, but such as it is, I hope you will accept it.</p>

<p id="par8">In my answer to Mr. HOOKE, you may remember, I had occasion to say <a id="l49"></a>something of hypotheses, where I gave a reason, why all allowable hypotheses <a id="l50"></a>in their genuine constitution should be conformable to my theories; and said <a id="l51"></a>of Mr. HOOKE'S hypothesis, that I took the most free and natural application <a id="l52"></a>of it to phænomena to be this<sup>i</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> : that the agitated parts of bodies, according <a id="l53"></a>to their several sizes, figure, and motions, do excite vibrations in the æther of <a id="l54"></a>various depths or bignesses, which being promiscuously propagated through that <a id="l55"></a>medium to our eyes, effect in us a sensation of light of a white colour; but, <a id="l56"></a>if by any means those of unequal bignesses be separated from one another, the <a id="l57"></a>largest beget a sensation of a red colour; the least, or shortest, of a deep <a id="l58"></a>violet; and the intermediate ones, of intermediate colours: much after the <a id="l59"></a>manner that bodies, according to their several sizes, shapes, and motions, ex<a id="l60"></a>cite vibrations in the air of various bignesses, which, according to those big<a id="l61"></a>nesses, make several tones in sound, &amp;c. I was glad to understand, as I ap<a id="l62"></a>prehend, from Mr. HOOKE'S discourse at my last being at one of your assem<a id="l63"></a>blies, that he had changed his former notion of all colours being compounded <a id="l64"></a>of only two original ones, made by the two sides of an oblique pulse; and <a id="l65"></a>accommodated his hypothesis to this my suggestion of colours, like sounds, <a id="l66"></a>being various, according to the various bigness of the pulses. For this I take <a id="l67"></a>to be a more plausible hypothesis than any other described by former authors, <a id="l68"></a>because I see not how the colours of thin transparent plates or skins can be <a id="l69"></a>handsomely explained, without having recourse to æthereal pulses: but yet I <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p249"> &lt;249&gt; </span> like another hypothesis better, which I had occasion to hint something of in the <a id="l70"></a>same letter in these words<sup>k</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> :</p>
<p id="par9"><em>The hypothesis of light's being a body, had I propounded it, has a much greater <a id="l71"></a>affinity with the objector's own hypothesis, than he seems to be aware of; the vibra<a id="l72"></a>tions of the æther being as useful and necessary in this as in his. For, assuming the <a id="l73"></a>rays of light to be small bodies emitted every way from shining substances, those, <a id="l74"></a>when they impinge on any refracting or reflecting superficies, must as necessarily ex<a id="l75"></a>cite vibrations in the æther, as stones do in water when thrown into it. And, sup<a id="l76"></a>posing these vibrations to be of several depths or thicknesses, accordingly as they are <a id="l77"></a>excited by the said corpuscular rays of various sizes and velocities; of what use <a id="l78"></a>they will be for explicating the manner of reflexion and refraction; the production of <a id="l79"></a>heat by the sun-beams; the emission of light from burning, putrifying, or other sub<a id="l80"></a>stances, whose parts are vehemently agitated; the phænomena of thin transparent <a id="l81"></a>plates, and bubbles, and of all natural bodies; the manner of vision, and the dif<a id="l82"></a>ference of colours; as also their harmony and discord; I shall leave to their consi<a id="l83"></a>deration, who may think it worth their endeavour to apply this hypothesis to the <a id="l84"></a>solution of phænomena</em>.</p>
<p id="par10">Were I to assume an hypothesis, it should be this, if propounded more ge<a id="l85"></a>nerally, so as not to determine what light is, farther than that it is something <a id="l86"></a>or other capable of exciting vibrations in the æther: for thus it will become <a id="l87"></a>so genreal and comprehensive of other hypotheses, as to leave little room for <a id="l88"></a>new ones to be invented. And therefore, because I have observed the heads <a id="l89"></a>of some great virtuosos to run much upon hypotheses, as if my discourses want<a id="l90"></a>ed an hypothesis to explain them by, and found, that some, when I could not <a id="l91"></a>make them take my meaning, when I spake of the nature of light and colours <a id="l92"></a>abstractedly, have readily apprehended it, when I illustrated my discourse by <a id="l93"></a>an hypothesis; for this reason I have here thought fit to send you a descrip<a id="l94"></a>tion of the circumstances of this hypothesis as much tending to the illustration <a id="l95"></a>of the papers I herewith send you. And though I shall not assume either this or <a id="l96"></a>any other hypothesis, not thinking it necessary to concern myself, whether the <a id="l97"></a>properties of light, discovered by me, be explained by this, or Mr. HOOKE'S, <a id="l98"></a>or any other hypothesis capable of explaining them; yet while I am describ<a id="l99"></a>ing this, I shall sometimes, to avoid circumlocution, and to represent it more <a id="l100"></a>conveniently, speak of it, as if I assumed it, and propounded it to be believed. <a id="l101"></a>This I though fit to express, that no man may confound this with my other <a id="l102"></a>discourses, or measure the certainty of one by the other, or think me obliged <a id="l103"></a>to answer objections against this script: for I desire to decline being involved <a id="l104"></a>in such troublesome and insignificant disputes.</p>
<p id="par11">But to proceed to the hypothesis: First, it is to be supposed therein, that <a id="l105"></a>there is an æthereal medium much of the same constitution with air, but far <a id="l106"></a>rarer, subtler, and more strongly elastic. Of the existence of this medium <a id="l107"></a>the motion of a pendulum in a glass exhausted of air almost as quickly as in <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p250"> &lt;250&gt; </span> the open air, is no inconsiderable argument. But it is not to be supposed, <a id="l108"></a>that this medium is one uniform matter, but compounded, partly of the main <a id="l109"></a>phlegmatic body of æther, partly of other various æthereal spirits, much after <a id="l110"></a>the manner, that air is compounded of the phlegmatic body of air intermixed <a id="l111"></a>with various vapours and exhalations: for the electric and magnetic effluvia, <a id="l112"></a>and gravitating principle, seem to argue such variety. Perhaps the whole <a id="l113"></a>frame of nature may be nothing but various contextures of some certain æthe<a id="l114"></a>real spirits, or vapours, condensed as it were by precipitation, much after the <a id="l115"></a>manner, that vapours are condensed into water, or exhalations into grosser sub<a id="l116"></a>stances, though not so easliy condensible; and after condensation wrought into <a id="l117"></a>various forms; at first by the immediate hand of the Creator; and ever since <a id="l118"></a>by the power of nature; which, by virtue of the command, increase and <a id="l119"></a>multiply, become a complete imitator of the copies set her by the protoplast. <a id="l120"></a>Thus perhaps may all things be originated from æther.</p>
<p id="par12">At least, the elastic effluvia seem to instruct us, that there is something of <a id="l121"></a>an æthereal nature condensed in bodies. I have sometimes laid upon a table <a id="l122"></a>a round piece of glass about two inches broad set in a brass ring, so that the <a id="l123"></a>glass might be about one eighth or one sixth of an inch from the table, and <a id="l124"></a>the air between them inclosed on all sides by the ring, after the manner as if <a id="l125"></a>I had whelmed a little sieve upon the table; and then rubbing a pretty while <a id="l126"></a>the glass briskly with some rough and raking stuff, till some very little fragments <a id="l127"></a>of very thin paper, laid on the table under the glass, began to be attracted and <a id="l128"></a>move nimbly to and fro; after I had done rubbing the glass, the papers would <a id="l129"></a>continue a pretty while in various motions; sometimes leaping up to the glass <a id="l130"></a>and resting there a while; then leaping down and resting there; then leaping <a id="l131"></a>up, and perhaps down and up again, and this sometimes in lines seeming per<a id="l132"></a>pendicular to the table; sometimes in oblique ones; sometimes also they would <a id="l133"></a>leap up in one arch and down in another, divers times together, without <a id="l134"></a>sensibly resting between; sometimes skip in a bow from one part of the glass <a id="l135"></a>to another without touching the table, and sometimes hang by a corner, and <a id="l136"></a>turn often about very nimbly, as if they had been carried about in the midst <a id="l137"></a>of a whirlwind, and be otherwise variously moved, every paper with a diverse <a id="l138"></a>motion. And upon sliding my finger on the upper side of the glass, though <a id="l139"></a>neither the glass, nor inclosed air below, were moved thereby, yet would the <a id="l140"></a>papers, as they hung under the glass, receive some new motion, inclining this <a id="l141"></a>way or that way, accordingly as I moved my finger. Now, whence all these <a id="l142"></a>irregular motions should spring, I cannot imagine, unless from some kind of <a id="l143"></a>subtil matter lying condensed in the glass, and rarefied by rubbing, as water is <a id="l144"></a>rarefied into vapour by heat, and in that refraction diffused through the space <a id="l145"></a>round the glass to a great distance, and made to move and circulate variously, <a id="l146"></a>and accordingly to actuate the papers till it return into the glass again, and be <a id="l147"></a>recondensed there. And as this condensed matter by rarefaction into an æthe<a id="l148"></a>real wind (for by its easy penetrating and circulating through glass I esteem it <a id="l149"></a>æthereal) may cause these odd motions, and by condensing again may cause <a id="l150"></a>electrical attraction with its returning to the glass to succeed in the place of <a id="l151"></a>what is there continually recondensed; so may the gravitating attraction of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p251"> &lt;251&gt; </span> earth be caused by the continual condensation of some other such like æthereal <a id="l152"></a>spirit, not of the main body of phlegmatic æther, but of something very <a id="l153"></a>thinly and subtilly difused through it, perhaps of an unctuous or gummy, <a id="l154"></a>tenacious, and springy nature, and bearing much the same relation to æther, <a id="l155"></a>which the vital aereal spirit, requisite for the conservation of flame and vital <a id="l156"></a>motions, does to air. For, if such an æthereal spirit may be condensed in <a id="l157"></a>fermenting or burning bodies, or otherwise coagulated in the pores of the earth <a id="l158"></a>and water into some kind of humid active matter, for the continual uses of <a id="l159"></a>nature, adhering to the sides of those pores, after the manner that vapours <a id="l160"></a>condense on the sides of a vessel; the vast body of the earth, which may be <a id="l161"></a>every where to the very center in perpetual working, may continually condense <a id="l162"></a>so much of this spirit, as to cause it from above to descend with great celerity <a id="l163"></a>for a supply; in which descent it may bear down with it the bodies it pervades <a id="l164"></a>with force proportional to the superficies of all their parts it acts upon; nature <a id="l165"></a>making a circulation by the slow ascent of as much matter out of the bowels <a id="l166"></a>of the earth in an aereal form, which, for a time, constitues the atmosphere; <a id="l167"></a>but being continually buoyed up by the new air; exhalations and vapours rising <a id="l168"></a>underneath, at length (some parts of the vapours, which return in rain, excepted) <a id="l169"></a>vanishes again into the æthereal spaces, and there perhaps in time relents, and is <a id="l170"></a>attenuated into its first principle: for nature is a perpetual worker, generating <a id="l171"></a>fluids out of solids, and solids out of fluids, fixed things out of volatile, and <a id="l172"></a>volatile out of fixed, subtil out of gross and gross out of subtil; some things <a id="l173"></a>to ascend, and make the upper terrestrial juices, rivers, and the atmosphere; and <a id="l174"></a>by consequence, others to descend for a requital to the former. And, as the <a id="l175"></a>earth, so perhaps may the sun imbibe this spirit copiously, to conserve his shin<a id="l176"></a>ing, and keep the planets from receding further from him. And they, that <a id="l177"></a>will, may also suppose, that this spirit affords or carries with it thither the solary <a id="l178"></a>fewel and material principle of light: and that the vast æthereal spaces between <a id="l179"></a>us and the stars are for a sufficient repository for this food of the sun and <a id="l180"></a>planets. But this of the constitution of æthereal natures by the by.</p>
<p id="par13">In the <em>second</em> place, it is to be supposed, that the æther is a vibrating medium <a id="l181"></a>like air, only the vibrations far more swift and minute; those of air, made by <a id="l182"></a>a man's ordinary voice, succeeding one another at more than half a foot or a <a id="l183"></a>foot distance; but those of æther at a less distance than the hundred thousandth <a id="l184"></a>part of an inch. And, as in air the vibrations are some larger than others, <a id="l185"></a>but yet all equally swift (for in a ring of bells the sound of every tone is heard <a id="l186"></a>at two or three miles distance, in the same order that the bells are struck;) so, <a id="l187"></a>I suppose, the æthereal vibrations differ in bigness, but not in swiftness. Now, <a id="l188"></a>these vibrations, beside their use in reflexion and refraction, may be supposed <a id="l189"></a>the chief means, by which the parts of fermenting or putrifying substances, <a id="l190"></a>fluid liquors, or melted, burning, or other hot bodies, continue in motion, are <a id="l191"></a>shaken asunder like a ship by waves, and dissipated into vapours, exhalations, <a id="l192"></a>or smoke, and light loosed or excited in those bodies, and consequently by <a id="l193"></a>which a body becomes a burning coal, and smoke, flame; and, I suppose, <a id="l194"></a>flame is nothing but the particles of smoke turned by the access of light and <a id="l195"></a>heat to burning coals, little and innumerable.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p252"> &lt;252&gt; </span>
<p id="par14"><em>Thirdly</em>, as the air can pervade the bores of small glass pipes, but yet not so <a id="l196"></a>easily as if they were wider; and therefore stands at a greater degree of rarity <a id="l197"></a>than in the free aereal spaces, and at so much a greater degree of rarity as the <a id="l198"></a>pipe is smaller, as is known by the rising of water in such pipes to a much <a id="l199"></a>greater hight than the surface of the stagnating water, into which they are <a id="l200"></a>dipped; so I suppose æther, though it pervades the pores of crystal, glass, <a id="l201"></a>water, and other natural bodies, yet it stands at a greater degree of rarity in <a id="l202"></a>those pores, than in the free æthereal spaces, and at so much a greater degree of <a id="l203"></a>rarity, as the pores of the body are smaller. Whence it may be, that the spirit <a id="l204"></a>of wine, for instance, though a lighter body, yet having subtiler parts, and <a id="l205"></a>consequently smaller pores, than water, is the more strongly refracting liquor. <a id="l206"></a>This also may be the principal cause of the cohesion of the parts of solids and <a id="l207"></a>fluids, of the springiness of glass, and bodies, whose parts slide not one upon <a id="l208"></a>another in bending, and of the standing of the mercury in the Torricellian <a id="l209"></a>experiment, sometimes to the top of the glass, though a much greater hight <a id="l210"></a>than twenty-nine inches. For the denser æther, which surrounds these bodies, <a id="l211"></a>must croud and press their parts together, much after the manner that air <a id="l212"></a>surrounding two marbles presses them together, if there be little or no air be<a id="l213"></a>tween them. Yea, and that puzzling problem; <em>By what means the muscles are <a id="l214"></a>contracted and dilated to cause animal motion, may receive greater light from hence <a id="l215"></a>than from any means men have hitherto been thinking on</em>. For, if there be any <a id="l216"></a>power in man to condense and dilate at will the æther, that pervades the <a id="l217"></a>muscle, that condensation or dilation must vary the compression of the muscle, <a id="l218"></a>made by the ambient æther, and cause it to swell or shrink accordingly. For <a id="l219"></a>though common water will scarce shrink by compression, and swell by relax<a id="l220"></a>ation, yet (so far as my observation reaches) spirit of wine and oil will; and <a id="l221"></a>Mr. BOYLE'S experiment of a tadpole shrinking very much by hard compres<a id="l222"></a>sing the water, in which it swam, is an argument, that animal juices do the <a id="l223"></a>same. And as for their various pression by the ambient æther, it is plain, <a id="l224"></a>that that must be more or less accordingly as there is more or less æther with<a id="l225"></a>in, to sustain and counterpoise the pressure of that without. If both æthers <a id="l226"></a>were equally dense, the muscle would be at liberty, as if pressed by neither: <a id="l227"></a>if there were no æther within, the ambient would compress it with the whole <a id="l228"></a>force of its spring. If the æther within were twice as much dilated as that <a id="l229"></a>without, so as to have but half as much springiness, the ambient would have <a id="l230"></a>half the force of its springiness counterpoised thereby, and exercise but the <a id="l231"></a>other half upon the muscle; and so in all other cases the ambient compresses <a id="l232"></a>the muscle by the excess of the force of its springiness above that of the spring<a id="l233"></a>iness of the included. To vary the compression of the muscle therefore, and <a id="l234"></a>so to swell and shrink it, there needs nothing but to change the consistence <a id="l235"></a>of the included æther; and a very little change may suffice, if the spring of <a id="l236"></a>æther be supposed very strong, as I take it to be many degrees stronger <a id="l237"></a>than that of air.</p>
<p id="par15">Now for the changing the consistence of the æther; some may be ready to <a id="l238"></a>grant, that the soul may have an immediate power over the whole æther in <a id="l239"></a>any part of the body, to swell or shrink it at will: but then how depends the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p253"> &lt;253&gt; </span>muscular motion on the nerves? Others therefore may be more apt to think <a id="l240"></a>it done by some certain æthereal spirit included within the <em>dura mater</em>, which <a id="l241"></a>the soul may have power to contract or dilate at will in any muscle, and so <a id="l242"></a>cause it to flow thither through the nerves. But still there is a difficulty, why <a id="l243"></a>this force of the soul upon it does not take off the power of its springiness, <a id="l244"></a>whereby it should sustain, more or less, the force of the outward æther. A <a id="l245"></a>third supposition may be, that the soul has a power to inspire any muscle with <a id="l246"></a>this spirit, by impelling it thither through the nerves. But this too has its <a id="l247"></a>difficulties, for it requires a forcible intending the spring of the æther in the <a id="l248"></a>muscles, by pressure exerted from the parts of the brain: and it is hard to <a id="l249"></a>conceive, how so great force can be exercised amidst so tender matter as the <a id="l250"></a>brain is. And besides, why does not this æthereal spirit, being subtil enough, <a id="l251"></a>and urged with so great force, go away through the dura mater and skins of <a id="l252"></a>the muscle; or at least so much of the other æther to go out to make way for <a id="l253"></a>this, which is crouded in? To take away these difficulties is a digression; but <a id="l254"></a>seeing the subject is a deserving one, I shall not stick to tell you how I think <a id="l255"></a>it may be done.</p>
<p id="par16">First then, I suppose, there is such a spirit; that is, that the animal spirits <a id="l256"></a>are neither like the liquor, vapour, or gas of spirit of wine; but of an æthereal <a id="l257"></a>nature, subtil enough to pervade the animal juices, as freely as the electric, or <a id="l258"></a>perhaps magnetic, effluvia do glass. And to know, how the coats of the <a id="l259"></a>brain, nerves, and muscles, may become a convenient vessel to hold so subtil <a id="l260"></a>a spirit, you may consider, how liquors and spirits are disposed to pervade or <a id="l261"></a>not pervade things on other accounts than their subtilty. Water and oil per<a id="l262"></a>vade wood and stone, which quicksilver does not; and quicksilver metals, <a id="l263"></a>which water and oil do not: water and acid spirits pervade salts, which oil <a id="l264"></a>and spirit of wine do not; and oil and spirit of wine pervade sulphur, which <a id="l265"></a>water and acid spirits do not. So some fluids, as oil and water, though their <a id="l266"></a>parts are in freedom enough to mix with one another, yet by some secret <a id="l267"></a>principle of unsociableness they keep asunder; and some, that are sociable, may <a id="l268"></a>become unsociable, by adding a third thing to one of them, as water to spirit <a id="l269"></a>of wine, by dissolving salt of tartar in it. The like unsociableness may be in <a id="l270"></a>æthereal natures, as perhaps between the æthers in the vortices of the sun and <a id="l271"></a>planets; and the reson, why air stands rarer in the boxes of small glass-pipes, <a id="l272"></a>and æther in the pores of bodies, than elsewhere, may be, not want of sub<a id="l273"></a>tilty, but sociableness. And on this ground, if the æthereal vital spirit in a <a id="l274"></a>man be very sociable to the marrow and juices, and unsociable to the coats of <a id="l275"></a>the brain, nerves, and muscles, or any thing lodged in the pores of those <a id="l276"></a>we suppose no great violence done to it to squeeze it out; and that it may not <a id="l277"></a>be altogether so subtil as the main body of æther, though subtil enough to <a id="l278"></a>pervade readily the animal juices, and that, as any of it is spent, it is continu<a id="l279"></a>ally supplied by new spirit from the heart.</p>
<p id="par17">In the next place, for knowing how this spirit may be used for animal mo<a id="l280"></a>tion, you may consider, how some things unsociable are made sociable by the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p254"> &lt;254&gt; </span>mediation of a third. Water, which will not disolve copper, will do it, if <a id="l281"></a>the copper be melted with sulphur: aqua fortis, which will not pervade gold, <a id="l282"></a>will do it by addition of a little sal armoniac, or spirit of salt: lead will not <a id="l283"></a>mix in melting with copper, but if a little tin or antimony be added, they mix <a id="l284"></a>readily, and part again of their own accord, if the antimony be wasted by <a id="l285"></a>throwing saltpeter or otherwise: and so lead melted with silver quickly per<a id="l286"></a>vades and liquefies the silver in a much less heat than is requsite to melt the <a id="l287"></a>silver alone; but, if they be kept in the test till that little substance, that re<a id="l288"></a>conciled them, be wasted or altered, they part again of their own accord. And, <a id="l289"></a>in like manner, the æthereal animal spirit in a man may be a mediator between <a id="l290"></a>the common æther and the muscular juices, to make them mix more freely; <a id="l291"></a>and so, by sending a little of this spirit into any muscle, though so little as to <a id="l292"></a>cause no sensible tension of the muscle by its own force; yet, by rendering the <a id="l293"></a>juices more sociable to the common external æther, it may cause that æther to <a id="l294"></a>pervade the muscle of its own accord in a moment more freely and copiously <a id="l295"></a>than it would otherwise do, and to recede again as freely, so soon as this medi<a id="l296"></a>ator of sociableness is retracted. Whence, according to what I said above, <a id="l297"></a>will proceed the swelling or shrinking of the muscle, and consequently the ani<a id="l298"></a>mal motion depending thereon.</p>
<p id="par18">Thus may therefore the soul, by determining this æthereal animal spirit or <a id="l299"></a>wind into this or that nerve, perhaps with as much ease as air is moved in open <a id="l300"></a>spaces, cause all the motions we see in animals: for the making which motions <a id="l301"></a>strong, it is not necessary, that we should suppose the æther within the muscle <a id="l302"></a>very much condensed or rarified by this means, but only that its spring is so <a id="l303"></a>very great, that a little alteration of its density shall cause a great alteration in <a id="l304"></a>the pressure, And what is said of muscular motion, may be applied to the mo<a id="l305"></a>tion of the heart, only with this difference, that the spirit is not sent thither, <a id="l306"></a>as into other muscles, but continually generated there by the fermentation of <a id="l307"></a>the juices, with which its flesh is replenished, and as it is generated, let out by <a id="l308"></a>starts into the brain through some convenient ductus to perform those motions <a id="l309"></a>in other muscles by impression, which it did in the heart by its generation. <a id="l310"></a>For I see not, why the ferment in the heart may not raise as subtil a spirit out <a id="l311"></a>of its juices, to cause these motions, as rubbing does out of a glass, to cause <a id="l312"></a>electric attraction, or burning out of fewel, to penetrate glass, as Mr. BOYLE <a id="l313"></a>has shewn, and calcine by corrosion metals melted therein.</p>
<p id="par19">Hitherto I have been contemplating the nature of æther and æthereal sub<a id="l314"></a>stances by their effects and uses; and now I come to join therewith the consi<a id="l315"></a>deration of light.</p>
<p id="par20">In the fourth place therefore, I suppose light is neither æther, nor its vibrating <a id="l316"></a>motion, but something of a different kind propagated from lucid bodies. They, <a id="l317"></a>that will, may suppose it an aggregate of various peripatetic qualities. Others <a id="l318"></a>may suppose it multitudes of unimaginable small and swift corpuscles of various <a id="l319"></a>sizes, springing from shining bodies at great distances one after another; but <a id="l320"></a>yet without any sensible interval of time, and continually urged forward by a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p255"> &lt;255&gt; </span>principle of motion, which in the beginning accelerates them, till the resistence <a id="l321"></a>of the æthereal medium equal the force of that principle, much after the <a id="l322"></a>manner that bodies let fall in water are accelerated till the resistance of the wa<a id="l323"></a>ter equals the force of gravity. God, who gave animals self-motion beyond <a id="l324"></a>our understanding, is, without doubt, able to implant other principles of mo<a id="l325"></a>tion in bodies, which we may understand as little. Some would readily grant <a id="l326"></a>this may be a spiritual one; yet a mechanical one might be shewn, did not I <a id="l327"></a>think it better to pass it by. But they, that like not this, may suppose light <a id="l328"></a>any other corporeal emanation, or any impulse or motion of any other medium <a id="l329"></a>or æthereal spirit diffused through the main body of æther, or what else they <a id="l330"></a>can imagine proper for this purpose. To avoid dispute, and make this hypo<a id="l331"></a>thesis general, let every man here take his fancy: only, whatever light be, I <a id="l332"></a>suppose, it consists of rays differing from one another in contingent circum<a id="l333"></a>stances, as bigness, form, or vigour; like as the sands on the shore, the waves <a id="l334"></a>of the sea, the faces of men, and all other natural things of the same kind <a id="l335"></a>differ; it being almost impossible for any sort of things to be found without <a id="l336"></a>some contingent variety. And further, I would suppose it diverse, from the <a id="l337"></a>vibrations of the æther, because (besides, that were it these vibrations, it <a id="l338"></a>ought always to verge copiously in crooked lines into the dark or quiescent <a id="l339"></a>medium, destroying all shadows; and to comply readily with any crooked pores <a id="l340"></a>or passages, as sounds do,) I see not how any superficies (as the side of a glass<a id="l341"></a>prism, on which the rays within are incident at an angle of above forty de<a id="l342"></a>grees) can be totally opake. For the vibrations beating against the refract<a id="l343"></a>ing confine of the rarer and denser æther must needs make that pliant super<a id="l344"></a>ficies undulate, and those undulations will stir up and propagate vibrations on <a id="l345"></a>the other side. And further, how light, incident on very thin skins or plates <a id="l346"></a>of any transparent body, should, for many successive thicknesses of the plate <a id="l347"></a>in arithmetical progression, be alternately reflected and transmitted, as I find <a id="l348"></a>it is, puzzles me as much. For, though the arithmetical progression of those <a id="l349"></a>thicknesses, which reflect and transmit the rays alternately, argues, that it de<a id="l350"></a>pends upon the number of vibrations between the two superficies of the plate, <a id="l351"></a>whether the ray shall be reflected or transmitted: yet I cannot see, how the <a id="l352"></a>number should vary the case, be it greater or less, whole or broken, unless <a id="l353"></a>light be supposed something else than these vibrations. Something indeed <a id="l354"></a>I could fancy towards helping the two last difficulties, but nothing which I see <a id="l355"></a>not insufficient.</p>
<p id="par21">Fifthly, it is to be supposed, that light and æther mutually act upon one <a id="l356"></a>another, æther in refracting light, and light in warming æther; and that the <a id="l357"></a>densest æther acts most strongly. When a ray therefore moves through æther <a id="l358"></a>of uneven density, I suppose it most pressed, urged, or acted upon by the me<a id="l359"></a>dium on that side towards the denser æther, and receives a continual impulse or <a id="l360"></a>ply from that side to recede towards the rarer, and so is accelerated, if it move <a id="l361"></a>that way, or retarded, if the contrary. On this ground, if a ray move <a id="l362"></a>obliquely through such an unevenly dense medium (that is, obliquely to those <a id="l363"></a>imaginary superficies, which run through the equally dense parts of the me<a id="l364"></a>dium, and may be called the refracting superficies) it must be incurved, as it <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p256"> &lt;256&gt; </span>is found to be, by observation in water<sup>1</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> , whose lower parts were made gradu<a id="l365"></a>ally more salt, and so more dense than the upper. And this may be the ground <a id="l366"></a>of all refraction and reflexion: for as the rarer air within a small glass-pipe, <a id="l367"></a>and the denser without, are not distinguished by a meer mathematical super<a id="l368"></a>ficies, but have air between them, at the orifice of the pipe, running through <a id="l369"></a>all intermediate degrees of density: so I suppose the refracting superficies of <a id="l370"></a>æther, between unequally dense mediums, to be not a mathematical one; but <a id="l371"></a>of some breadth, the æther therein, at the orifices of the pores of the solid body, <a id="l372"></a>being of all intermediate degrees of density between the rarer and denser æthe<a id="l373"></a>real mediums; and the refraction I conceive to proceed from the continual <a id="l374"></a>incurvation of the ray all the while it is passing the physical superficies. Now, <a id="l375"></a>if the motion of the ray be supposed in this passage to be increased or dimi<a id="l376"></a>nished in a certain proportion, according to the difference of the densities of the <a id="l377"></a>æthereal mediums, and the addition or detraction of the motion be reckoned <a id="l378"></a>in the perpendicular from the refracting superficies, as it ought to be, the sines <a id="l379"></a>of incidence and refraction will be proportional according to what DES CARTES <a id="l380"></a>has demonstrated.</p>
<p id="par22">The ray therefore, in passing out of the rarer medium into the denser, <a id="l381"></a>inclines continually more and more towards parallelism with the refracting su<a id="l382"></a>perficies; and if the differing densities of the mediums be not so great, nor the <a id="l383"></a>incidence of the ray so oblique, as to make it parallel to that superficies before <a id="l384"></a>it gets through, then it goes through and is refracted; but if, through the afore<a id="l385"></a>said causes, the ray become parallel to that superficies before it can get through, <a id="l386"></a>then it must turn back and be reflected. Thus, for instance, may be observed <a id="l387"></a>in a triangular glass-prism O E F, that the rays A <em>n</em>, <a id="l388"></a>that send out of the glass into the air, do, by inclining <a id="l389"></a>them more and more to the refracting superficies, emerge <a id="l390"></a>more and more obliquely till they be infinitely oblique; <a id="l391"></a>that is, in a manner parallel to the superficies, which hap<a id="l392"></a>pens when the angle of incidence is about forty degrees; <a id="l393"></a>and then, if they be a little more inclined are all reflected, <a id="l394"></a>as at A V <span class="greek">λ</span>, becoming, I suppose, parallel to the superficies before they can get <a id="l395"></a>through it. Let A B D C represent the rarer medium; E F H G the denser, <a id="l396"></a>C D F E the space between them, or re<a id="l397"></a>fracting physical superficies, in which the <a id="l398"></a>æther is of all intermediate degrees of <a id="l399"></a>density, from the rarest æther at C D, <a id="l400"></a>to the densest, at E F; A <em>m n</em> L a ray, <a id="l401"></a>A <em>m</em> its incident part, <em>m n</em> its incurvation <a id="l402"></a>by the refracting superficies, and <em>n</em> L its <a id="l403"></a>emergent part. Now, if the ray A <em>m</em> be <a id="l404"></a>so much incurved as to become at its <a id="l405"></a>emergence <em>n</em>, as nearly as may be, paral<a id="l406"></a>lel to C D, it is plain, that if that ray <a id="l407"></a>had been incident a little more obliquely, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p257"> &lt;257&gt; </span>it must have become parallel to C D, before it had arrived at E F,the further <a id="l408"></a>side of the refracting superficies; and so could have got no nearer to E F, but <a id="l409"></a>must have turned back by further incurvation, and been reflected, as it is re<a id="l410"></a>presented at A <span class="greek">μ</span> V <span class="greek">λ</span>. And the like would have happened, if the density <a id="l411"></a>of the æther had further increased from E F to P Q; so that P Q H G might <a id="l412"></a>be a denser medium than E F H G was supposed; for then the ray, in pass<a id="l413"></a>ing from <em>m</em> to <em>n</em>, being so much incurved, as at <em>n</em> to become parallel to C D <a id="l414"></a>or P Q, it is impossible it should ever get nearer to P Q, but must at <em>n</em> be<a id="l415"></a>gin by further incurvation to turn back, and so be reflected. And because, if <a id="l416"></a>a refracted ray, as <em>n</em> L, be made incident, the incident, A <em>m</em>, shall become the <a id="l417"></a>refracted; and therefore, if the ray A <span class="greek">μ</span> V, after it is arrived at V, where I <a id="l418"></a>suppose it parallel to the refracting superficies, should be refracted perpendicu<a id="l419"></a>larly back, it would return back in the line of incidence V <span class="greek">μ</span> A. Therefore <a id="l420"></a>going forward, it must go forward in such another line, V <span class="greek">π λ</span>, both cases be<a id="l421"></a>ing alike, and so be reflected at an angle, equal to that of incidence.</p>
<p id="par23">This may be the cause and manner of reflection, when light tends from the <a id="l422"></a>rarer towards the denser æther: but to know, how it should be reflected, <a id="l423"></a>when it stands from the denser towards the rarer, you are further to consider, <a id="l424"></a>how fluids near their superficies are less pliant and yielding than in their more <a id="l425"></a>inward parts; and, if formed into thin plates, or shells, they become much <a id="l426"></a>more stiff and tenacious than otherwise. Thus, things, which readily fall in <a id="l427"></a>water, if let fall upon a bubble of water, they do not easily break through it, <a id="l428"></a>but are apt to slide down by the sides of it, if they be not too big and heavy. <a id="l429"></a>So, if two well polished convex glasses, ground on very large spheres, be laid <a id="l430"></a>one upon another, the air between them easily recedes, till they almost touch; <a id="l431"></a>but then begins to resist so much, that the weight of the upper glass is too <a id="l432"></a>little to bring them together so as to make the black, mentioned in the other <a id="l433"></a>papers I send you, appear in the midst of the rings of colours: and, if the <a id="l434"></a>glasses be plain, though no broader than a two-pence, a man with his whole <a id="l435"></a>strength is not able to press all the air out from between them, so as to make <a id="l436"></a>them fully touch. You may observe also, that insects will walk upon water <a id="l437"></a>without wetting their feet, and the water bearing them up; also motes fal<a id="l438"></a>ling upon water will often lie long upon it without being wetted: and so, <a id="l439"></a>I suppose, æther in the confine of two mediums is less pliant and yielding <a id="l440"></a>than in other places, and so much the less pliant by how much the mediums <a id="l441"></a>differ in density: so that in passing out of denser æther into rarer, when there <a id="l442"></a>remains but a very little of the denser æther to be past through, a ray finds <a id="l443"></a>more than ordinary difficulty to get through; and so great difficulty, where the <a id="l444"></a>mediums are of very differing density, as to be reflected by incurvation, after <a id="l445"></a>the manner described above; the parts of æther on that side, where they are <a id="l446"></a>less pliant and yielding, acting upon the ray much after the manner that they <a id="l447"></a>would do were they denser there than on the other side: for the resistance of <a id="l448"></a>the medium ought to have the same effect on the ray, from what cause soever <a id="l449"></a>it arises. And this, I suppose, may be the cause of the reflection of quick<a id="l450"></a>silver, and other metalline bodies. It must also concur to increase the reflective <a id="l451"></a>virtue of the superficies, when rays tend out of the rarer medium into the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p258"> &lt;258&gt; </span>denser: and, in that case therefore, the reflection having a double cause, ought <a id="l452"></a>to be stronger than in the æther, as it is apparently. But in refraction, this ri<a id="l453"></a>gid tenacity or unpliableness of the superficies need not be considered, because <a id="l454"></a>so much as the ray is thereby bent in passing to the most tenacious and rigid <a id="l455"></a>part of the superficies, so much it is thereby unbent again in passing on from <a id="l456"></a>thence through the next parts gradually less tenacious.</p>
<p id="par24">Thus may rays be refracted by some superficies, and reflected by others, be <a id="l457"></a>the medium they tend into, denser or rarer. But it remains further to be ex<a id="l458"></a>plained, how rays alike incident on the same superficies (suppose of crystal, glass, <a id="l459"></a>or water) may be at the same time some refracted, others reflected. And for ex<a id="l460"></a>plaining this, I suppose, that the rays, when they impinge on the rigid resist<a id="l461"></a>ing æthereal superficies, as they are acted upon by it, so they react upon it and <a id="l462"></a>cause vibrations in it, as stones thrown into water do in its surface; and that <a id="l463"></a>these vibrations are propagated every way into both the rarer and the denser me<a id="l464"></a>diums; as the vibrations of air, which cause sound, are from a stroke, but yet <a id="l465"></a>continue strongest where they began, and alternately contract and dilate the æther <a id="l466"></a>in that physical superficies. For it is plain by the heat, which light produces in <a id="l467"></a>bodies, that it is able to put their parts in motion, and much more to heat and <a id="l468"></a>put in motion the more tender æther; and it is more probable, that it com<a id="l469"></a>municates motion to the gross parts of bodies by the mediation of æther than <a id="l470"></a>immediately; as for instance, in the inward parts of quicksilver, tin, silver, <a id="l471"></a>and other very opake bodies, by generating vibrations, that run through them, <a id="l472"></a>than by striking the outward parts only, without entering the body. The shock <a id="l473"></a>of every single ray may generate many thousand vibrations, and by sending <a id="l474"></a>them all over the body, move all the parts, and that perhaps with more mo<a id="l475"></a>tion than it could move one single part by an immediate stroke; for the vi<a id="l476"></a>brations, by shaking each particle backward and forward, may every time <a id="l477"></a>increase its motion, as a ringer does a bell by often pulling it, and so at length <a id="l478"></a>move the particles to a very great degree of agitation, which neither the simple <a id="l479"></a>shock of a ray, nor any other motion in the æther, besides a vibrating one could <a id="l480"></a>do. Thus in air shut up in a vessel, the motion of its parts caused by heat, <a id="l481"></a>how violent soever, is unable to move the bodies hung in it, with either a trem<a id="l482"></a>bling or progressive motion: but if air be put into a vibrating motion by beat<a id="l483"></a>ing a drum or two, it shakes glass-windows, the whole body of a man, and <a id="l484"></a>other massy things, especially those of a congruous tone: yea I have observed it <a id="l485"></a>manifestly shake under my feet a cellared free-stone floor of a large hall, so as, <a id="l486"></a>I believe, the immediate stroke of five hundred drumsticks could not have done, <a id="l487"></a>unless perhaps quicky succeeding one another at equal intervals of time. Æthe<a id="l488"></a>real vibrations are therefore the best means by which such a subtile agent as <a id="l489"></a>light can shake the gross particles of solid bodies to heat them: and so sup<a id="l490"></a>posing that light, impinging on a refracting or reflecting æthereal superficies, puts <a id="l491"></a>it into a vibrating motion, that physical superficies being by the perpetual ap<a id="l492"></a>pulse of rays always kept in a vibrating motion, and the æther therein conti<a id="l493"></a>nually expanded and compressed by turns; if a ray of light impinge upon it, <a id="l494"></a>while it is much compressed, I suppose it is then too dense and stiff to let the ray <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p259"> &lt;259&gt; </span>pass through, and so reflects it; but the rays, that impinge on it at other times, <a id="l495"></a>when it is either expanded by the interval of two vibrations, or not too much <a id="l496"></a>compressed and condensed, go through and are refracted.</p>
<p id="par25">These may be the causes of refractions and reflections in all cases; but, for <a id="l497"></a>understanding how they come to be so regular, it is further to be considered, <a id="l498"></a>that in a heap of sand, although the surface be rugged, yet if water be poured <a id="l499"></a>on it to fill its pores, the water, so soon as its pores are filled, will evenly over<a id="l500"></a>spread the surface, and so much the more evenly, as the sand is finer: so, al<a id="l501"></a>though the surface of all bodies, even the most polished, be rugged, as I con<a id="l502"></a>ceive, yet where that ruggedness is not too gross and coarse, the refracting æthe<a id="l503"></a>real superficies may evenly overspread it. In polishing glass or metal, it is not <a id="l504"></a>to be imagined, that sand, putty, or other fretting powders, should wear the <a id="l505"></a>surface so regularly, as to make the front of every particle exactly plain, and <a id="l506"></a>all those plains look the same way, as they ought to do in well polished bodies, <a id="l507"></a>were reflection performed by their parts: but that those fretting powders should <a id="l508"></a>wear the bodies first to a coarse ruggedness, such is sensible, and then to a finer <a id="l509"></a>and finer ruggedness, till it be so fine that the æthereal superficies evenly over<a id="l510"></a>spreads it, and so makes the body put on the appearance of a polish, is a very na<a id="l511"></a>tural and intelligible supposition. So in fluids, it is not well to be conceived, that <a id="l512"></a>the surfaces of their parts should be all plain, and the plains of the superficial parts <a id="l513"></a>always kept looking all the same way, notwithstanding that they are in perpetual <a id="l514"></a>motion. And yet without these two suppositions, the superficies of fluids could <a id="l515"></a>not be so regularly reflexive as they are, were the reflexion done by the parts them<a id="l516"></a>selves, and not by an æthereal superficies evenly overspreading the fluid.</p>
<p id="par26">Further, concerning the regular motion of light, it might be suspected, whe<a id="l517"></a>ther the various vibrations of the fluid, through which it passes, may not much <a id="l518"></a>disturb it: but that suspicion, I suppose, will vanish, by considering, that <a id="l519"></a>if at any time the foremost part of an oblique wave begin to turn it awry, <a id="l520"></a>the hindermost part, by a contrary action, must soon set it straight again.</p>
<p id="par27">Lastly, because without doubt there are, in every transparent body, pores of <a id="l521"></a>various sizes, and I said, that æther stands at the greatest rarity in the smallest <a id="l522"></a>pores; hence the æther in every pore should be of a differing rarity, and so <a id="l523"></a>light be refracted in its passage out of every pore into the next, which would <a id="l524"></a>cause a great confusion, and spoil the body's transparency. But considering that <a id="l525"></a>the æther, in all dense bodies, is agitated by continual vibrations, and these vi<a id="l526"></a>brations cannot be performed without forcing the parts of æther forward and <a id="l527"></a>backward, from one pore to another, by a kind of tremor, so that the æther, <a id="l528"></a>which one moment is in a greater pore, is the next moment forced into a less; <a id="l529"></a>and on the contrary, this must evenly spread the æther into all the pores not <a id="l530"></a>exceeding some certain bigness, suppose the breadth of a vibration, and so make <a id="l531"></a>it of an even density throughout the transparent body, agreeable to the middle <a id="l532"></a>sort of pores. But where the pores exceed a certain bigness, I suppose <a id="l533"></a>the æther suits its density to the bigness of the pore, or to the medium within <a id="l534"></a>it; and so being of a diverse density from the æther that surrounds it, refracts <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p260"> &lt;260&gt; </span>or reflects light in its superficies, and so make the body, where many such in<a id="l535"></a>terstices are, appear opake.</p>
<p id="par28">Some of the members taking particular notice, among other things, of an <a id="l536"></a>experiment mentioned in this hypothesis, desired, that it might be tried; viz. <a id="l537"></a>that having laid upon a table a round piece of glass, about two inches broad, in a <a id="l538"></a>brass ring; so that the glass might be one third part of an inch from the table; <a id="l539"></a>and then rubbing the glass briskly, till some little fragments of paper laid on the <a id="l540"></a>table under the glass began to be attracted, and move nimbly to and fro; after <a id="l541"></a>he had done rubbing the glass, the papers would continue a pretty while in va<a id="l542"></a>rious motions, sometimes leaping up to the glass, and resting there a while, then <a id="l543"></a>leaping down, and resting there, and then leaping up and down again, and this <a id="l544"></a>sometimes in lines seeming perpendicular to the table, sometimes in oblique <a id="l545"></a>ones; sometimes also leaping up in one arch, and leaping down in another divers <a id="l546"></a>times together, without sensibly resting between; sometimes skipping in a bow <a id="l547"></a>from one part of the glass to another, without touching the table, and sometimes <a id="l548"></a>hanging by a corner, and turning often about very nimbly, as if they had been <a id="l549"></a>carried about in the middle of a whirlwind; and being otherwise variously moved, <a id="l550"></a>every paper with a different motion. And upon sliding his finger upon the up<a id="l551"></a>per side of the glass, though neither the glass not the inclosed air below were moved <a id="l552"></a>thereby, yet would the papers, as they hung under the glass, receive some new <a id="l553"></a>motion, inclining this or that way, according as he moved his finger.</p>
<p id="par29">This experiment Mr. NEWTON proposed to be varied with a larger glass placed <a id="l554"></a>farther from the table, and to make use of bits of leaf gold instead of papers; <a id="l555"></a>thinking, that this would succeed much better, so as perhaps to make the leaf gold <a id="l556"></a>rise and fall in spiral lines, or whirl for a time in the air, without touching either <a id="l557"></a>the table or glass.</p>
<p id="par30">It was ordered, that this experiment should be tried at the next meeting; and <a id="l558"></a>Mr. HOOKE promised to prepare it for that meeting.</p>
<p id="par31">Mr. OLDENBURG was desired to enquire by letter of Mr. NEWTON, whether <a id="l559"></a>he would consent, that a copy might be taken of his papers, for the better consi<a id="l560"></a>deration of their contents.</p>

<p id="par33"><em>December</em> 16. Mr. NEWTON'S experiment of glass rubbed to cause various mo<a id="l562"></a>tions in bits of paper underneath, was tried, but did not succeed in those circum<a id="l563"></a>stances, with which it was tried. This trial was made upon the reading of a letter <a id="l564"></a>of his own to Mr. OLDENBURG, dated at Cambridge, 14th December, 1675<sup>m</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> , in <a id="l565"></a>which he gives some more particular directions about that experiment.</p>
<p id="par34">The letter was as follows:</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p261"> &lt;261&gt; </span>
<div>
<p id="par35">The notice you gave me of the Royal Society's intending to see the experi<a id="l566"></a>ment of glass rubbed, to cause various motions in bits of paper underneath, <a id="l567"></a>put me upon recollecting myself a little further about it; and then remembring, <a id="l568"></a>that, if one edge of the brass hoop was laid downward, the glass was as near <a id="l569"></a>again on the table as it was when the other edge was laid downward, and that <a id="l570"></a>the papers played best when the glass was nearest to the table; I began to sus<a id="l571"></a>pect, that I had set down a greater distance of the glass from the table than I <a id="l572"></a>should have done; for in setting down that experiment, I trusted to the idea I <a id="l573"></a>had of the bigness of the hoop, in which I might easily be mistaken, having <a id="l574"></a>not seen it of a long time. And this suspicion was increased by trying the ex<a id="l575"></a>periment with an object glass of a telescope, placed about the third part of an <a id="l576"></a>inch from the table; for I could not see the papers play any thing near so well <a id="l577"></a>as I had seen them formerly. Whereupon I looked for the old hoop with its <a id="l578"></a>glass, and at length found the hoop, the glass being gone; but by the hoop I <a id="l579"></a>perceived, that, when one edge was turned down, the glass was almost the <a id="l580"></a>third part of an inch from the table, and when the other edge was down, <a id="l581"></a>which made the papers play so well, the glass was scarce the eighth part of an <a id="l582"></a>inch from the table. This I thought fit to signify to you, that, if the expe<a id="l583"></a>riment succeed not well at the distance I set down, it may be tried at a less <a id="l584"></a>distance, and that you may alter my paper, and write in it the eighth part of an <a id="l585"></a>inch instead of <span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1" style="width: 0.712em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.709em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.353em, 1000.71em, 3.043em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-3"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.474em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.3em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -4.426em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-4" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">1</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.32em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -3.593em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-5" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">2</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1000.47em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 0.474em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.452em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.389em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-1"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></script> or <span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-6" style="width: 0.712em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.709em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.353em, 1000.71em, 3.058em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-7"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-8"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.474em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.3em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -4.426em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-9" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">1</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.32em, 4.204em, -1000em); top: -3.594em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-10" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">3</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1000.47em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 0.474em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.467em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.404em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-2"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math></script> of an inch.

<p id="par36">Pray present my humble service to Mr. BOYLE, when you see him, and thanks <a id="l591"></a>for the favour of the converse I had with him at Spring.

<p id="par37">As for registring the two discourses, you may do it; only I desire you would <a id="l597"></a>suspend till my next letter, in which I intend to set down something to be al<a id="l598"></a>tered, and something to be added in the hypothesis.</p>

<p id="par40">Thus much of refraction, reflection, transparency, and opacity; and now to <a id="l603"></a>explain colours; I suppose, that as bodies of various sizes, densities, or sensa<a id="l604"></a>tions, do by percussion or other action excite sounds of various tones, and <a id="l605"></a>consequently vibrations in the air of various bigness; so when the rays of <a id="l606"></a>light, by impinging on the stiff refracting superficies, excite vibrations in the <a id="l607"></a>æther, those rays, whatever they be, as they happen to differ in magnitude, <a id="l608"></a>strength or vigour, excite vibrations of various bigness; the biggest, strongest, <a id="l609"></a>or most potent rays, the largest vibrations; and others shorter, according to <a id="l610"></a>their bigness, strength, or power: and therefore the ends of the capillamenta of <a id="l611"></a>the optic nerve, which pave or face the retina, being such refracting superfi<a id="l612"></a>cies, when the rays impinge upon them, they must there excite these vibra<a id="l613"></a>tions, which vibrations (like those of sound in a trunk or trumpet) will run <a id="l614"></a>along the aqueous pores or crystalline pith of the capillamenta through the <a id="l615"></a>optic nerves into the sensorium (which light itself cannot do) and there, I sup<a id="l616"></a>pose, affect the sense with various colours, according to their bigness and mix<a id="l617"></a>ture; the biggest with the strongest colours, reds and yellows; the least with <a id="l618"></a>the weakest, blues and violets; the middle with green, and a confusion of <a id="l619"></a>all with white, much after the manner, that in the sense of hearing, nature <a id="l620"></a>makes use of aereal vibrations of several bignesses to generate sounds of divers <a id="l621"></a>tones; for the analogy of nature is to be observed. And further, as the <a id="l622"></a>harmony and discord of sounds proceed from the proportions of the aereal vi<a id="l623"></a>brations, so may the harmony of some colours, as of golden and blue, and the <a id="l624"></a>discord of others, as of red and blue, proceed from the proportions of the æthe<a id="l625"></a>real. And possibly colour may be distinguished into its principal degrees, red, <a id="l626"></a>orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and deep violet, on the same ground, <a id="l627"></a>that sound within an eighth is graduated into tones. For, some years past, the <a id="l628"></a>prismatic colours being in a well darkened room cast perpendicularly upon <a id="l629"></a>a paper about two and twenty foot distant from the prism, I desired a friend <a id="l630"></a>to draw with a pencil lines cross the image, or pillar of colours, where every <a id="l631"></a>one of the seven aforenamed colours was most full and brisk, and also where he <a id="l632"></a>judged the truest confines of them to be, whilst I held the paper so, that the said <a id="l633"></a>image might fall within a certain compass marked on it. And this I did, partly <a id="l634"></a>because my own eyes are not very critical in distinguishing colours, partly be<a id="l635"></a>cause another, to whom I had not communicated my thoughts about this mat<a id="l636"></a>ter, could have nothing but his eyes to determine his fancy in making those <a id="l637"></a>marks. This observation we repeated divers times, both in the same and di<a id="l638"></a>vers days, to see how the marks on several papers would agree; and comparing <a id="l639"></a>the observations, though the just confines of the colours are hard to be assigned, <a id="l640"></a>because they pass into one another by insensible gradation; yet the <em>differences</em> <a id="l641"></a>of the observations were but little, especially towards the red end, and taking <a id="l642"></a>means between those differences, that were, the length of the image (reckoned <a id="l643"></a>not by the distance of the verges of the semicircular ends, but by the distance of <a id="l644"></a>the centres of those semicircles, or length of the strait sides as it ought to be) <a id="l645"></a>was divided in about the same proportion that a string is, between the end and <a id="l646"></a>the middle, to sound the tones in the eighth. You will understand me best <a id="l647"></a>by viewing the annexed figure, in which A B and C D represent the strait <a id="l648"></a>sides, about ten inches long, A B C and B T D the semicircular ends, X and <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p263"> &lt;263&gt; </span>Y the centres of those semicicles, X Z the length of a musical string double to <a id="l649"></a>X Y, and divided between X and Y, so as to sound the tones expressed at the <a id="l650"></a>side (that is X H the half, X G and G I the third part, Y K the fifth part, <a id="l651"></a>Y M the eighth part, and G E the ninth part of X Y) and the intervals between <a id="l652"></a>these divisions express the spaces which the colours written there took up, every <a id="l653"></a>colour being the most briskly specific in the middle of those spaces.</p>
<p id="par41">Now for the cause of these and such like colours made by refraction, the <a id="l654"></a>biggest or strongest rays must penetrate the refracting superficies more freely <a id="l655"></a>and easily than the weaker, and so be less turned awry by it, that is, less re<a id="l656"></a>fracted; which is as much as to say, the rays, which make red, are least refran<a id="l657"></a>gible, those, which make blue and violet, most refrangible, and others otherwise <a id="l658"></a>refrangible according to their colour: whence, if the rays, which come promis<a id="l659"></a>cuously from the sun, be refracted by a prism, as in the aforesaid experiment, <a id="l660"></a>these of several sorts being variously refracted, must go to several places on an <a id="l661"></a>opposite paper or wall, and so parted, exhibit every one their own colours, <a id="l662"></a>which they could not do while blended together. And, because refraction only <a id="l663"></a>severs them, and changes not the bigness or strength of the ray, thence it is, <a id="l664"></a>that after they are once well severed, refraction cannot make any further changes <a id="l665"></a>in their colour.</p>
<p id="par42">On this ground may all the phænomena of refractions be understood: but to <a id="l666"></a>explain the colours made by reflections, I must further suppose, that, though <a id="l667"></a>light be unimaginably swift, yet the æthereal vibrations, excited by a ray, move <a id="l668"></a>faster than the ray itself, and so overtake and outrun it one after another. And <a id="l669"></a>this, I suppose, they will think an allowable supposition, who have been in<a id="l670"></a>clined to suspect, that these vibrations themselves might be light. But to make <a id="l671"></a>it the more allowable, it is possible light itself may not be so swift, as some are <a id="l672"></a>apt to think; for, notwithstanding any argument, that I know yet to the con<a id="l673"></a>trary, it may be an hour or two, if not more, in moving from the sun to us. <a id="l674"></a>This celerity of the vibrations therefore supposed, if light be incident on a thin <a id="l675"></a>skin or plate of any transparent body, the waves, excited by its passage through <a id="l676"></a>the first superficies, overtaking it one after another, till it arrive at the second <a id="l677"></a>superficies, will cause it to be there reflected or refracted accordingly as the con<a id="l678"></a>densed or expanded part of the wave overtakes it there. If the plate be of such <a id="l679"></a>a thickness, that the condensed part of the first wave overtake the ray at the se<a id="l680"></a>cond superficies, it must be reflected there; if double that thickness, that the <a id="l681"></a>following rarified part of the wave, that is, the space between that and the next <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p264"> &lt;264&gt; </span>wave, overtake it, there it must be transmitted; if triple the thickness, that the <a id="l682"></a>condensed part of the second wave overtake it, there it must be reflected, and <a id="l683"></a>so where the plate is five, seven, or nine times that thickness, it must be <em>reflected</em> <a id="l684"></a>by reason of the third, fourth, or fifth wave, overtaking it at the second super<a id="l685"></a>ficies; but when it is four, six, or eight times that thickness, so that the ray <a id="l686"></a>may be overtaken there by the dilated interval of those waves, it shall be <em>trans<a id="l687"></a>mitted</em>, and so on; the second superficies being made able or unable to reflect <a id="l688"></a>accordingly as it is condensed or expanded by the waves. For instance, let <a id="l689"></a>A H Q represent the superficies of a spherically convex glass laid upon a plain <a id="l690"></a>glass A I R, and A I R Q H the thin plane-concave plate of air between them, <a id="l691"></a>and B C, D E, F G, H I, &amp;c. thicknesses of that plate, or distances of the <a id="l692"></a>glasses in the arithmetical progression of the numbers 1. 2. 3. 4. &amp;c. whereof <a id="l693"></a>B C is the distance, at which the ray is over<a id="l694"></a>taken by the most condensed part of the first <a id="l695"></a>wave: I say, the rays incident at B, F, K, <a id="l696"></a>and O, ought to be <em>reflected</em> at C, G, L, <a id="l697"></a>and P, and those incident at D, H, M, and <a id="l698"></a>Q, ought to be <em>transmitted</em> at E, I, N, and <a id="l699"></a>R; and this, because the ray B C arrives <a id="l700"></a>at the superficies A C, when it is condensed, <a id="l701"></a>by the first wave that overtakes it; D E, <a id="l702"></a>when rarified by the interval of the first and <a id="l703"></a>second; F G when condensed by the se<a id="l704"></a>cond wave; H I, when rarified by the in<a id="l705"></a>terval of the second and third; and so on <a id="l706"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="1 line space left blank.">&nbsp;</span>for an indeterminate number of successions; and at A, the center or contact of <a id="l707"></a>the glasses, the light must be <em>transmitted</em>, because there the æthereal mediums <a id="l708"></a>in both glasses are continued as if but one uniform medium. Whence, if the <a id="l709"></a>glasses in this posture be looked upon, there ought to appear at A, the contact <a id="l710"></a>of the glasses, a black spot, and about that many concentric circles of light and <a id="l711"></a>darkness, the squares of whose semidiameters are to sense and arithmetical pro<a id="l712"></a>gression. Yet all the rays, without exception, ought not to be thus reflected or <a id="l713"></a>transmitted: for sometimes a ray may be overtaken at the second superficies, <a id="l714"></a>by the vibrations raised by another collateral or immediately succeeding ray; <a id="l715"></a>which vibration, being as strong or stronger than its own, may cause it to be <a id="l716"></a>reflected or transmitted when its own vibration alone would do the contrary. <a id="l717"></a>And hence some little light will be reflected from the black rings, which makes <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p265"> &lt;265&gt; </span>them rather black than totally dark; and some transmitted at the lucid rings, <a id="l718"></a>which makes the black rings, appearing on the other side of the glasses, not so <a id="l719"></a>black as they would otherwise be. And so at the central black spot, where the <a id="l720"></a>glasses do not absolutely touch, a little light will be reflected, which makes the <a id="l721"></a>spot darkest in the middle, and only black at the verges. For thus I have ob<a id="l722"></a>served it to be, by tying very hard together two glass prisms, which were ac<a id="l723"></a>cidentally (one of them at least) a very little convex, and viewing by divers <a id="l724"></a>lights this black spot at their contact. If a white paper was placed at a litle <a id="l725"></a>distance behind a candle, and the candle and paper viewed alternately by re<a id="l726"></a>flection from the spot, the verges of the spot, which looked by the light of the <a id="l727"></a>paper as black as the middle part, appeared by the stronger light of the candle <a id="l728"></a>lucid enough, so as to make the spot seem less than before; but in the middle part <a id="l729"></a>continued as absolutely black in one case as in the other, some specks and streaks <a id="l730"></a>in it only excepted, where I suppose the glasses, through some unevenness in <a id="l731"></a>the polish, did not fully touch. The same I have observed by viewing the spot <a id="l732"></a>by the like reflection of the sun and clouds alternately.</p>
<p id="par43">But to return to the lucid and black rings, those rings ought always to ap<a id="l733"></a>pear after the manner described, were light uniform. And after that manner, <a id="l734"></a>when two contiguous glasses A Q and A R have been illustrated, in a dark <a id="l735"></a>room, by light of any uniform colour made by a prism, I have seen the lucid <a id="l736"></a>circles appear to about twenty in number, with many dark ones between them, <a id="l737"></a>the colour of the lucid ones being that of the light, with which the glasses were <a id="l738"></a>illustrated. And if the glasses were held between the eye and prismatic colours, <a id="l739"></a>cast on a sheet of white-paper, or if any prismatic colour was directly trajected <a id="l740"></a>through the glasses to a sheet of paper placed a little way behind, there would <a id="l741"></a>appear such other rings of colour and darkness (in the first case between the <a id="l742"></a>glasses, in the second, on the paper) oppositely corresponding to those, which <a id="l743"></a>appeared by reflection: I mean, that, whereas by reflected light there appeared <a id="l744"></a>a black spot in the middle, and then a coloured circle; on the contrary, by trans<a id="l745"></a>mitted light there appeared a coloured spot in the middle, and then a black circle, <a id="l746"></a>and so on; the diameters of the coloured circles, made by transmission, equall<a id="l747"></a>ing the diameters of the black ones made by reflection.</p>
<p id="par44">Thus, I say, the rings do and ought to appear when made by uniform light; <a id="l748"></a>but in compound light it is otherwise. For the rays, which exhibit red and <a id="l749"></a>yellow, exciting, as I said, larger pulses in the æther than those, which make <a id="l750"></a>blue and violet, and consequently making bigger circles in a certain propor<a id="l751"></a>tion, as I have manifestly found they do, by illuminating the glasses successively <a id="l752"></a>by the aforesaid colours of prism in a well darkened room, without changing <a id="l753"></a>the position of my eye or of the glasses; hence the circles, made by illustrating <a id="l754"></a>the glasses with white light, ought not to appear black and white by turns, as <a id="l755"></a>the circles made by illustrating the glasses; for instance, with red light, appear <a id="l756"></a>red and black; but the colours, which compound the white light, must display <a id="l757"></a>themselves by being reflected, the blue and violet nearer to the center than the <a id="l758"></a>red and yellow, whereby every lucid circle must become violet in the inward <a id="l759"></a>verge, red in the outward, and of intermediate colours in the intermediate  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p266"> &lt;266&gt; </span>parts, and be made broader than before, spreading the colours both ways into <a id="l760"></a>those spaces, which I call the black rings, and which would here appear black, <a id="l761"></a>were the red, yellow, blue, and violet, which make the verge of the rings, taken <a id="l762"></a>out of the incident white light, which illustrates the glasses, and the green only <a id="l763"></a>left to make the lucid rings. Suppose C B, G D, L F, P M, R N, S X, re<a id="l764"></a>present quadrants of the circles made in a dark room by the very deepest pris<a id="l765"></a>matic <em>red</em> alone; and Y <span class="greek">β, γ δ</span>, <a id="l766"></a><span class="greek">λ φ, π μ, ρ ν, σ ξ</span>, the qua<a id="l767"></a>drants of like circles made <a id="l768"></a>also in a dark room, by the <a id="l769"></a>very deepest prismatic <em>violet</em> <a id="l770"></a>alone: and then, if the glas<a id="l771"></a>ses be illuminated by open <a id="l772"></a>day light, in which all sorts <a id="l773"></a>of rays are blended, it is ma<a id="l774"></a>nifest, that the first lucid <a id="l775"></a>ring will be Y <span class="greek">β</span> B C; the se<a id="l776"></a>cond <span class="greek">γ δ</span> D G, the third, <a id="l777"></a><span class="greek">λ φ</span> F L, the fourth <span class="greek">π μ</span> M P, <a id="l778"></a>the fifth <span class="greek">ρ ν</span> N R, the sixth <a id="l779"></a><span class="greek">σ ξ</span> X S, &amp;c. in all which <a id="l780"></a>the deepest violet must be <a id="l781"></a>reflected at the inward edges <a id="l782"></a>represented by the pricked <a id="l783"></a>lines, where it would be re<a id="l784"></a>flected were it alone, and the deepest <em>red</em> at the outward edges represented by <a id="l785"></a>the black lines, where it would be reflected, were it alone; and all intermediate <a id="l786"></a>colours at those places, in order, between these edges, at which they would be re<a id="l787"></a>flected were they alone; each of them in a dark room, parted from all other <a id="l788"></a>colours by the refraction of a prism. And because the squares of the semidia<a id="l789"></a>meters of the outward verges AC, A G, A L, &amp;c. as also of A Y, A <span class="greek">γ</span>, A <span class="greek">λ</span>, <a id="l790"></a>&amp;c. the semidiameters of the inward are in arithmetical progression of the num<a id="l791"></a>bers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &amp;c. and the squares of the inward are to the squares <a id="l792"></a>of the outward (A Y<sup>9</sup> to A C<sup>9</sup>, A <span class="greek">γ</span><sup>9</sup> to A G<sup>9</sup>, A <span class="greek">λ</span><sup>9</sup> to A L<sup>9</sup>, &amp;c.) as 9 to 14, <a id="l793"></a>(as I have found by measuring them carefully and often, and comparing the <a id="l794"></a>observations:) therefore the outward <em>red</em> verge of the second ring, and inward <a id="l795"></a><em>violet</em> one of the third, shall border upon one another (as you may know by com<a id="l796"></a>putation, and see them represented in the figure) and the like edges of the third <a id="l797"></a>and fourth rings shall interfere, and those of the fourth and fifth interfere more, <a id="l798"></a>and so on. Yea, the colours of every ring must spread themselves something <a id="l799"></a>more both ways than is here represented, because the quadrantal arcs here de<a id="l800"></a>scribed represent not the verges, but the middle of the rings made in a dark <a id="l801"></a>room by the extreme violet and red; the <em>violet</em> falling on both sides the pricked <a id="l802"></a>arches, and <em>red</em> on both sides the black line arches. And hence it is, that <a id="l803"></a>these rings or circuits of colours succeed one another continually, without any <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p267"> &lt;267&gt; </span>intevening black, and that the colours are pure only in the three or four first <a id="l804"></a>rings, and then intervening and mixing more and more, dilute one another so <a id="l805"></a>much, that after eight of nine rings they are no more to be distinguished, but <a id="l806"></a>seem to constitute an even whiteness; whereas, when they were made in a dark <a id="l807"></a>room by one of the prismatic colours alone, I have, as I said, seen above twenty <a id="l808"></a>of them, and without doubt could have seen them to a greater number, had I <a id="l809"></a>taken the pains to make the primatic colours more uncompounded. For by <a id="l810"></a>unfolding these rings from one another, by certain refractions expressed in the <a id="l811"></a>other<sup>s</sup><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>  papers I send you, I have, even in day-light, discovered them to above <a id="l812"></a>an hundred; and perhaps they would have appeared innumerable, had the light <a id="l813"></a>or colour illustrating the glasses been absolutely uncompounded, and the pupil <a id="l814"></a>of my eye but a mathematical point; so that the rays, which came from <a id="l815"></a>the same point of the glass might have gone into my eye at the same obliquity <a id="l816"></a>to the glass.</p>
<p id="par45">What has been hitherto said of the rings, is to be understood of their appear<a id="l817"></a>ance to an unmoved eye: but if you vary the position of the eye, the more <a id="l818"></a>obliquely you look on the glass, the larger the rings appear. And of this the <a id="l819"></a>reason may be, partly that an oblique ray is longer in passing through the <a id="l820"></a>first superficies, and so there is more time between the waving forward and back<a id="l821"></a>ward of that superficies, and consequently a larger wave generated, and partly, <a id="l822"></a>that the wave in creeping along between the two superficies may be impeded and <a id="l823"></a>retarded by the rigidness of those superficies, bounding it at either end, and so <a id="l824"></a>not overtake the ray so soon as a wave, that moves perpendicularly cross.</p>
<p id="par46">The bigness of the circles made by every colour, and at all obliquities of the <a id="l825"></a>eye to the glass, and the thickness of the air, or intervals of the glasses, <a id="l826"></a>where each circle is made, you will find expressed in the other papers I send <a id="l827"></a>you; where also I have more at large described, how much these rings inter<a id="l828"></a>fere, or spread into one another; what colours appear in every ring, where <a id="l829"></a>they are most lively, where and how much diluted by mixing with the colours of <a id="l830"></a>other rings; and how the contrary colours appear on the back side of the glasses <a id="l831"></a>by the transmitted light, the glasses transmitting light of one colour at the same <a id="l832"></a>place, where they reflect that of another. Nor need I add any thing further of <a id="l833"></a>the colours of other thinly plated mediums, as of water between the aforesaid <a id="l834"></a>glasses, or formed into bubbles, and so encompassed with air, or of glass blown <a id="l835"></a>into very thin bubbles at a lamp furnace, &amp;c. the case being the same in all these, <a id="l836"></a>excepting that, where the thickness of the plate is not regular, the rings will not <a id="l837"></a>be so; that in plates of denser transparent bodies, the rings are made at a less <a id="l838"></a>thickness of the plate (the vibrations, I suppose, being shorter in rarer æther than <a id="l839"></a>in denser) and that in a denser plate, surrounded with a rarer body, the colours <a id="l840"></a>are more vivid than in the rarer surrounded with the denser; as, for instance, <a id="l841"></a>more vivid in a plate of glass surrounded with air, than in a plate of air sur<a id="l842"></a>rounded with glass; of which the reason is, that the reflection of the second su<a id="l843"></a>perficies, which causes the colours, is, as was said above, stronger in the for<a id="l844"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p268"> &lt;268&gt; </span>mer case than in the latter: for which reason also the colours are most vivid, <a id="l845"></a>when the difference of the density of the medium is greatest.</p>
<p id="par47">Of the colours of natural bodies also I have said enough in those papers, shew<a id="l846"></a>ing how the various sizes of the transparent particles, of which they consist, is <a id="l847"></a>sufficient to produce them all, those particles reflecting or transmitting this or <a id="l848"></a>that sort of rays, according to their thickness, like the aforesaid plates, as if they <a id="l849"></a>were fragments thereof. For, I suppose, if a plate of an even thickness, and <a id="l850"></a>consequently of an uniform colour, were broken into fragments of the same thick<a id="l851"></a>ness with the plate, a heap of those fragments would be a powder much of the <a id="l852"></a>same colour with the plates. And so, if the parts be of the thickness of the <a id="l853"></a>water in the black spot at the top of a bubble described in the seventeenth of <a id="l854"></a>the observations I send you, I suppose the body must be black. In the pro<a id="l855"></a>duction of which blackness, I suppose, that the particles of that size being dis<a id="l856"></a>posed to reflect almost no light outward, but to refract it continually in its pas<a id="l857"></a>sage from every part to the next; by this multitude of refractions, the rays <a id="l858"></a>are kept so long straggling to and fro within the body, till at last almost all <a id="l859"></a>impinge on the solid parts of the body, and so are stopped and stifled; those <a id="l860"></a>parts having no sufficient elasticity, or other disposition to return nimbly enough <a id="l861"></a>the smart shock of the ray back upon it.</p>
<p id="par48">I should here conclude, but that there is another strange phænomenon of <a id="l862"></a>colours, which may deserve to be taken notice of. Mr. HOOKE, you may re<a id="l863"></a>member, was speaking of an odd straying of light, caused in its passage near the <a id="l864"></a>edge of a razor, knife, or other opake body in a dark room; the rays, which <a id="l865"></a>pass very near the edge, being thereby made to stray at all angles into the <a id="l866"></a>shadow of the knife.</p>
<p id="par49">To this Sir WILLIAM PETTY, then president, returned a very pertinent query, <a id="l867"></a>Whether that straying was in curve lines? and that made me, having heard <a id="l868"></a>Mr. HOOKE some days before compare it to the straying of sound into the qui<a id="l869"></a>escent medium, say, that I took it to be only a new kind of refraction, caused <a id="l870"></a>perhaps by the external æther's beginning to grow rarer a little before it <a id="l871"></a>came at the opake body, than it was in free spaces; the denser æther without <a id="l872"></a>the body, and the rarer within it, being terminated not in a mathematical <a id="l873"></a>superficies, but passing into one another through all intermediate degrees of <a id="l874"></a>density: whence the rays, that pass so near the body, as to come within that <a id="l875"></a>compass, where the outward æther begins to grow rarer, must be refracted by <a id="l876"></a>the uneven denseness thereof, and blended inwards toward the rarer medium of <a id="l877"></a>the body. To this Mr. HOOKE was then pleased to answer, that though it <a id="l878"></a>should be but a new kind of refraction, yet it was a new one. What to make <a id="l879"></a>of this unexpected reply, I knew not; having no other thoughts, but that a <a id="l880"></a>new kind of refraction might be as noble an invention as any thing else about <a id="l881"></a>light; but it made me afterwards, I know not upon what occasion, happen to <a id="l882"></a>say, among some that were present to what passed before, that I thought I had <a id="l883"></a>seen the experiment before in some Italian author. And the author is HONO<a id="l884"></a>RATUS FABER, in his dialogue De Lumine, who had it from GRIMALDO; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p269"> &lt;269&gt; </span>whom I mention, because I am to describe something further out of him, which <a id="l885"></a>you will apprehend by this figure: supppose the sun shine through the little hole <a id="l886"></a>H K into a dark room upon the paper P Q, and with a wedge M N O intercept <a id="l887"></a>all but a little of that beam, and you will see <a id="l888"></a>upon the paper six rows of colours, R, S, T, <a id="l889"></a>V, X, Y, and beyond them a very faint light <a id="l890"></a>spreading either way, such as rays broken, like <a id="l891"></a>H N Z, must make. The author describes it <a id="l892"></a>more largely in divers schemes. I have time <a id="l893"></a>only to hint the sum of what he says.</p>
<p id="par50">Now for the breaking of the ray H N Z, sup<a id="l894"></a>pose, in the next figure M N O be the solid <a id="l895"></a>wedge, A B C the inward bound of the uniform <a id="l896"></a>rarer æther within, beween which bounds the <a id="l897"></a>æther runs through all the intermediate degrees; <a id="l898"></a>and it is manifest, that, if a ray come between <a id="l899"></a>B and N, it must in its passage there bend from <a id="l900"></a>the denser medium towards C, and that so much <a id="l901"></a>the more, by how much it comes nearer N. Fur<a id="l902"></a>ther, for the three rows of colours V X Y, those <a id="l903"></a>may perhaps proceed from the number of vibra<a id="l904"></a>tions (whether one, two, or three) which over<a id="l905"></a>take the ray in its passage from G, till it be about <a id="l906"></a>the mid-way between G and H; that is, at its <a id="l907"></a>nearest distance to N, so as to touch the circle <a id="l908"></a>described about N, with that distance; by the <a id="l909"></a>last of which vibrations, expanding or con<a id="l910"></a>tracting the medium there, the ray is licensed <a id="l911"></a>to recede again from N, and go on to make the <a id="l912"></a>colours; or further bent about N, till the inter<a id="l913"></a>val of the next wave overtake it, and give it li<a id="l914"></a>berty to go from N, very nearly in the line it is <a id="l915"></a>then moving, suppose toward Z, to cause the faint light spoken of above, you <a id="l916"></a>will understand me a little better, by comparing this with what was said of the <a id="l917"></a>colours of thin transparent plates, comparing the greatest distance that the ray <a id="l918"></a>goes from G B H towards N, to the thickness of one of those plates. Some<a id="l919"></a>thing too there is in DES CARTES'S explication of the rainbow's colours, which <a id="l920"></a>would give further light in this. But I have no time left to insist further upon <a id="l921"></a>particulars; nor do I propound this without diffidence, having not made suffici<a id="l922"></a>ent observation about it.</p>

<p id="par53"><em>December</em> 30. There was read a letter to Mr. OLDENBURG from Mr. NEW<a id="l925"></a>TON, dated at Cambridge 21st December, 1675<sup>t</sup><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> , in answer to what had been <a id="l926"></a>written to him by Mr. OLDENBURG concerning the want of success of his expe<a id="l927"></a>riment made with a glass rubbed &amp;c. This letter was as follows:</p>
<div>
<p id="par54">Upon your letter I took another glass four inches broad, and one fourth of <a id="l928"></a>an inch thick, of such glass as telescopes are made of, and placed it a one sixth <a id="l929"></a>part of an inch from the table. It was set in such a piece of wood, as the ob<a id="l930"></a>ject-glasses of telescopes use to be set in: and the experiment succeeded well. <a id="l931"></a>After the rubbing was still, and all was still, the motion of the papers would <a id="l932"></a>continue sometimes while I counted a hundred, every paper leaping up about <a id="l933"></a>twenty times more or less, and down as often. I tried also with two other glasses <a id="l934"></a>that belong to a telescope, and it succeeded with both; and I make no question <a id="l935"></a>but any glass will do that, if it be excited to electric virtue, as I think any may. <a id="l936"></a>If you have a mind to any of these glasses, you may have them; but I sup<a id="l937"></a>pose, if you cannot make it do in other glass, you will fail in any I can send <a id="l938"></a>you. I am apt to suspect the failure was in the manner of rubbing; for I have <a id="l939"></a>observed, that the rubbing variously, or with various things, alters the case. At <a id="l940"></a>one time I rubbed the aforesaid great glass with a napkin, twice as much as I <a id="l941"></a>used to do with my gown, and nothing would stir; and yet presently rubbing <a id="l942"></a>it with something else, the motions soon began. After the glass has been <a id="l943"></a>much rubbed too, the motions are not so lasting; and the next day I found the <a id="l944"></a>motions fainter and difficulter to excite than the first. If the Society have a <a id="l945"></a>mind to attempt it any more, I can give no better advice than this: to take a <a id="l946"></a>new glass not yet rubbed (perhaps one of the old ones may do well enough after <a id="l947"></a>it has lain still a while) and let this be rubbed, not with linen, nor soft nappy <a id="l948"></a>woolen, but with stuff, whose threads may rake the surface of the glass, sup<a id="l949"></a>pose tamerine, or the like, doubled up in the hand, and this with a brisk mo<a id="l950"></a>tion as may be, till an hundred or an hundred and fifty may be counted, the <a id="l951"></a>glass lying all the while over the papers. Then, if nothing stir, rub the glass <a id="l952"></a>with the finger ends half a score of times to and fro, or knock your finger<a id="l953"></a>ends as often upon the glass; for this rubbing or knocking with your fingers, <a id="l954"></a>after the former rubbing, conduces most to excite the papers. If nothing stir <a id="l955"></a>yet, rub again with the cloth till sixty or eighty may be counted, and then <a id="l956"></a>rub or knock again with your fingers, and repeat this till the electric virtue of <a id="l957"></a>the glass be so far excited as to take up the papers, and then a very little rubb<a id="l958"></a>ing or knocking now and then will revive the motions. In doing all this, let <a id="l959"></a>the rubbing be always done as nimbly as may be; and if the motion be circular, like that of glass-grinding, it may do better. But if you cannot make it <a id="l961"></a>yet succeed, it must be let alone till I have some opportunity of trying it be<a id="l962"></a>fore you. As for the suspicion of the papers being moved by the air, I am se<a id="l963"></a>cure from that; yet in the other, of drawing leaf-gold to above a foot distance, <a id="l964"></a>which I never went about to try myself till the last week, I suspect the air might <a id="l965"></a>raise the gold, and then a small attraction might determine it towards the glass; <a id="l966"></a>for I could not make it succeed.</p>

<div><p id="par55">It was ordered, that Mr. NEWTON'S directions in this letter should be observed <a id="l967"></a>in the experiment to be made at the next meeting of the Society.</p>
<p id="par56">Mr. OLDENBURG read a letter to himself from Mr. JOHN GASCOIGNE, dated <a id="l968"></a>at Liege, 15th December, 1675<sup>u</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> , acquainting him with the death of Mr. LINUS <a id="l969"></a>of the epidemical disease, which then raged through so many countries, and with <a id="l970"></a>the resolution of Mr. LINUS'S disciples, to try Mr. NEWTON'S experiment concern<a id="l971"></a>ing light and colours more clearly and carefully, and before more witnesses, accord<a id="l972"></a>ing to the directions given them by Mr. NEWTON'S last letter: intimating withal, <a id="l973"></a>that if the said experiment be made before the Royal Society, and be attested by <a id="l974"></a>them to succeed, as Mr. NEWTON affirmed, they would rest satisfied.</p>
<p id="par57">It was ordered, that when the sun should serve, the experiment should be made <a id="l975"></a>before the Society.</p>
<p id="par58">Mr. AUBREY presented the Society with his observations made in Wiltshire, which <a id="l976"></a>being read, he was desired to endeavour to procure some of the iron-ore of Sein <a id="l977"></a>in that county, said to be so rich, that the smith could melt it in his forge: as also <a id="l978"></a>to procure from Easton-Peires in Malmesbury hundred, some of the blue clay, <a id="l979"></a>free from sand, and almost of the colour of ultramarine; which clay Mr. DOIGHT <a id="l980"></a>supposed to be very fit for porcelane.</p>

<p id="par60"><em>January</em> 13. Captain HENRY SHEERES, JOHN MAPLETOFT, M.

<p id="par61">Mr. NEWTON'S experiment of glass rubbed, to cause various motions in bits <a id="l984"></a>of paper underneath, being made according to his more particular directions, suc<a id="l985"></a>ceeded very well. The rubbing was made both with a scrubbing brush, made of <a id="l986"></a>short hog's bristles, with a knife, the haft of the knife made of whalebone, and <a id="l987"></a>with the nail of one's finger. It appeared, that touching many parts at once <a id="l988"></a>with a hard and rough body, produced the effect expected.</p>
<p id="par62">It was ordered, that Mr. NEWTON should have the thanks of the Society, for <a id="l989"></a>giving himself the trouble of imparting to them such full instructions for making <a id="l990"></a>the experiment.</p>

<p id="par65">Mr. OLDENBURG produced likewise some papers of Mr. AUBREY, containing <a id="l997"></a>his observations of the county of Surry. But the time being elapsed, these papers <a id="l998"></a>were referred to the next meeting</p>
<p id="par66"><em>January</em> 20. Mr. AUBREY'S papers of observation on Surrey were read.</p>
<p id="par67">There was also read the beginning of Mr. NEWTON'S discourse, containing <a id="l999"></a>such observations, as conduce to further discoveries for completing his theory of <a id="l1000"></a>light and colours, especially as to the constitution of natural bodies, on which <a id="l1001"></a>their colours or transparency depend: in which he describes first the principal of <a id="l1002"></a>his observations, and then considers and makes use of them.</p>
<p id="par68">At this time there were read the first fifteen of those observations as follow<sup>z</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> :</p>

<p id="par69">I suppose you understand, that all transparent substances (as glass, water, <a id="l1003"></a>air &amp;c.) when made very thin by being blown into bubbles, or otherwise <a id="l1004"></a>formed into plates, do exhibit various colours, according to their various thin<a id="l1005"></a>ness, although at a greater thickness they appear very clear and colourless. In <a id="l1006"></a>my former discourse about the constitution of light, I omitted these colours, <a id="l1007"></a>because they seemed of a difficult consideration, and were not necessary for <a id="l1008"></a>the establishing of the doctrine, which I propounded; but because they may con<a id="l1009"></a>duce to further discoveries for compleating that theory, especially as to the <a id="l1010"></a>constitution of the parts of natural bodies, on which their colours or transpa<a id="l1011"></a>rency depend, I have now sent you an account of them. To render this dis<a id="l1012"></a>course short and distinct, I have first described the principal of my observations, <a id="l1013"></a>and then considered and made use of them. The observations are these:</p>
<p id="par70">Obs. 1. Compressing two prisms hard together, that their sides (which by <a id="l1014"></a>chance were a very little convex) might somewhere touch one another, I found <a id="l1015"></a>the place, in which they touched, to become<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup>  absolutely transparent, as if they <a id="l1016"></a>had been there one continued piece of glass; for when the light fell so ob<a id="l1017"></a>liquely on the air, which in other places was between them, as to be all re<a id="l1018"></a>flected, in that place of contact it seemed wholly transmitted; insomuch that <a id="l1019"></a>when looked upon, it appeared like a black or dark spot, by reason of no sen<a id="l1020"></a>sible light was reflected from thence, as from other places; and when looked <a id="l1021"></a>through, it seemed, as it were, a hole in that air, that was formed into a thin <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p273"> &lt;273&gt; </span>plate by being compressed between the glasses; and through this hole objects, <a id="l1022"></a>that were beyond, might be seen distinctly, which could not at all be seen through <a id="l1023"></a>other parts of the glasses, where the air was interjacent. Although the glasses <a id="l1024"></a>were a little convex, yet this transparent spot was of a considerable breadth, <a id="l1025"></a>which breadth seemed principally to proceed from the yielding inwards of the <a id="l1026"></a>parts of the glasses by reason of their mutual pressure; for by pressing them very <a id="l1027"></a>hard together, it would become much broader than otherwise.</p>
<p id="par71">Obs. 2. When the plate of air, by turning the prisms about their common <a id="l1028"></a>axis, became so little inclined to the incident rays, that some of them began to <a id="l1029"></a>be transmitted, there arose in it many slen<a id="l1030"></a>der arcs of colours, which at first were <a id="l1031"></a>shaped almost like the conchoid, as you see <a id="l1032"></a>them here delineated. And by continuing <a id="l1033"></a>the motion of the prisms, these arcs in<a id="l1034"></a>creased and bended more and more about <a id="l1035"></a>the said transparent spot, till they were <a id="l1036"></a>compleated into circles or rings incompassing it, and afterwards continually <a id="l1037"></a>grew more and more contracted.</p>
<p id="par72">These arcs, at their first appearance, were of a violet and blue colour, and <a id="l1038"></a>between them were white arcs of circles, which presently became a little tinged <a id="l1039"></a>in their inward limbs with red and yellow, and to their outward limbs the blue <a id="l1040"></a>was adjacent; so that the order of these colours from the central dark spot, <a id="l1041"></a>was at that time white, blue, violet, black, red, orange, yellow, white, blue, <a id="l1042"></a>violet, &amp;c. but the yellow and red were much fainter than the blue and vio<a id="l1043"></a>let.</p>
<p id="par73">The motion of the prisms about their axis being continued, these colours <a id="l1044"></a>contracted more and more, shrinking towards the whiteness on either side of <a id="l1045"></a>it, until they totally vanished into it; and then the circles in those parts ap<a id="l1046"></a>peared black, and white, without any other colours intermixed; but by fur<a id="l1047"></a>ther moving the prisms about, the colours again emerged out of the whiteness, <a id="l1048"></a>the violet and blue at its inward limb, and at its outward limb the red and yel<a id="l1049"></a><a id="l1050"></a>low; so that now their order from the central spot was white, yellow, red, <a id="l1051"></a>black, violet, blue, white, yellow, red &amp;c. contrary to what it was before.</p>
<p id="par74">Obs. 3. When the rings or some parts appeared only black and white, they <a id="l1052"></a>were very distinct and well defined, and the blackness seemed as intense as that <a id="l1053"></a>of the central spot; also, in the borders of these rings, where the colours began <a id="l1054"></a>to emerge out of the whiteness, they were pretty distinct, which made them vi<a id="l1055"></a>sible to a very great multitude. I have sometimes numbered above thirty suc<a id="l1056"></a>cessions (reckoning every black and white ring for one succession) and seen more <a id="l1057"></a>of them, which by reason of their smallness I could not number. But in other <a id="l1058"></a>positions of the prisms, at which the rings appeared of many colours, I could <a id="l1059"></a>not distinguish above eight or nine of them, and the exterior of those too <a id="l1060"></a>were confused and dilute.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p274"> &lt;274&gt; </span>
<p id="par75">In these two observations, to see the rings distinct, and without any other colour <a id="l1061"></a>but black and white, I found it necesary that I held my eye at a good distance <a id="l1062"></a>from them. For by approaching nearer, although in the same inclination of <a id="l1063"></a>my eye, yet there emerged a bluish colour out of the white, which by dilating <a id="l1064"></a>itself more and more into a black, rendered the circles less distinct, and left <a id="l1065"></a>the white a little tinged with red and yellow. I found also, that by looking <a id="l1066"></a>through a slit or oblong hole, which was narrower than the pupil of my eye, <a id="l1067"></a>and held close to it parallel to the prisms, I could see the circles much distincter <a id="l1068"></a>and visible to a far greater number than otherwise.</p>
<p id="par76">Obs. 4. To observe more nicely the order of the colours, which arose out of <a id="l1069"></a>the white circles, as the rays became less and less inclined to the plate of air; I <a id="l1070"></a>took two object-glasses, the one a plane-convex for a fourteen foot telescope, <a id="l1071"></a>and the other a large double convex for one of fifty foot; and upon this lay<a id="l1072"></a>ing the other with its plane side downwards, I pressed them slowly together, <a id="l1073"></a>to make the colours successively emerge in the middle of the circles, and then <a id="l1074"></a>slowly lifted the upper glass from the lower, to make them successively vanish <a id="l1075"></a>again in the same place, where being of a considerable breadth, I could more <a id="l1076"></a>easily discern them. And by this means I observed their succession and quan<a id="l1077"></a>tity to be as followeth.</p>
<p id="par77">Next to the pellucid central spot made by the contact of the glasses, suc<a id="l1078"></a>ceeded violet, blue, white, yellow, and red. The violet and blue were so very <a id="l1079"></a>little in quantity, that I could not discern them in the circles made by the <a id="l1080"></a>prisms; but the yellow and red were pretty copious, and seemed about as much <a id="l1081"></a>in extent as the white, and four or five times more than the blue and violet. <a id="l1082"></a>The next circuit or order of colours immediately encompassing these was vio<a id="l1083"></a>let, blue, green, yellow, and red. And these were all of them copious and <a id="l1084"></a>vivid, excepting the green, which was very little in quantity, and seemed much <a id="l1085"></a>more faint and dilute than the other colours. Of the other four the violet <a id="l1086"></a>was least, and the blue less than the yellow or red. The third circuit or order <a id="l1087"></a>was also purple, blue, green, yellow, and red, in which the purple seemed more <a id="l1088"></a>reddish than the violet in the former circuit, and the green was much more <a id="l1089"></a>conspicuous, being as brisk and copious as any of the other colours except the <a id="l1090"></a>yellow; but the red began to be a little faded, inclining very much to purple. <a id="l1091"></a>After these succeeded green and red: the green was very copious and lively, in<a id="l1092"></a>clining on the one side to blue, and the other to yellow. But in this fourth <a id="l1093"></a>circuit there was neither violet, blue, nor yellow, and the red was very imper<a id="l1094"></a>fect and dirty. Also the succeeding colours became more and more imperfect <a id="l1095"></a>and dilute, till after three or four more revolutions they ended in perfect white<a id="l1096"></a>ness.</p>
<p id="par78">Obs. 5. To determine the interval of the glasses, or thickness of the interja<a id="l1097"></a>cent air, by which each colour was produced; I measured the diameter of the <a id="l1098"></a>first six rings at the most lucid part of their orbits, and squaring them I found <a id="l1099"></a>their squares to be in arithmetical progression of the odd numbers, 1. 3. 5. 7. <a id="l1100"></a>9. 11. And since one of the glasses was plane and the other spherical, their <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p275"> &lt;275&gt; </span>intervals at those rings must be in the same progression. I measured also the <a id="l1101"></a>diameters of the dark or faint rings between the more lucid colours, and found <a id="l1102"></a>their squares to be in arithmetical progression, of the even numbers 2, 4, 6, <a id="l1103"></a>8, 10, 12; and it being very nice and difficult to take these measures exactly, <a id="l1104"></a>I repeated them divers times, at divers parts of the glasses, that by their agree<a id="l1105"></a>ment I might be confirmed in them; and the same method I used in deter<a id="l1106"></a>mining some others of the following obseravtions.</p>

<p id="par81">In the first two columns are expressed the obliquities of the rays to the plate <a id="l1130"></a>of air; that is, their angles of incidence and refraction. In the third column, <a id="l1131"></a>the diameter of any coloured ring of those obliquities is expressed in parts, of <a id="l1132"></a>which ten constitute that diameter, when the rays are perpendicular. And in <a id="l1133"></a>the fourth column the thickness of the air at the circumference of that ring is <a id="l1134"></a>expressed in parts, of which also ten constitute that thickness, when the rays <a id="l1135"></a>are perpendicular.</p>
<p id="par82">Obs. 8. The dark spot in the middle of the rings increased also by that <a id="l1136"></a>obliquation of the eye, although almost insensibly. But, if instead of the <a id="l1137"></a>object-glasses, the prisms were made use of, its increase was more manifest, when <a id="l1138"></a>viewed so obliquely, that no colours appeared about it. It was least, when the <a id="l1139"></a>rays were incident most obliquely on the interjacent air, and increased more and <a id="l1140"></a>more, until the coloured rings appeared, and then decreased again, but not so <a id="l1141"></a>much as it increased before. And hence it is evident, that the transparency <a id="l1142"></a>was not only at the absolute contact of the glasses, but also where they had some <a id="l1143"></a>little interval. I have sometimes observed the diameter of that spot to be be<a id="l1144"></a>tween half and two fifth parts of the diameter of the exterior circumference of <a id="l1145"></a>the red in the first circuit or revolution of colours, when viewed almost per<a id="l1146"></a>pendicularly; whereas, when viewed obliquely, it hath wholly vanished, and <a id="l1147"></a>become opake and white, like the other parts of the glass. Whence it may <a id="l1148"></a>be collected, that the glasses did then scarcely, or not at all, touch one ano<a id="l1149"></a>ther; and that their interval of the perimeter of that spot, when viewed per<a id="l1150"></a>pendicularly, was about a fifth or sixth part of their interval at the circum<a id="l1151"></a>ference of the said red.</p>
<p id="par83">Obs. 9. By looking through the two contiguous object-glasses, I found, that <a id="l1152"></a>the interjacent air exhibited rings of colours, as well by transmitting light as <a id="l1153"></a>by reflecting it. The central spot was now white, and from it the order of <a id="l1154"></a>the colours were yellowish, red, black, violet, blue, white, yellow, red; <a id="l1155"></a>violet, blue, green, yellow, red, &amp;c. but these colours were very faint and <a id="l1156"></a>dilute, unless when the light was trajected very obliquely through the glasses; <a id="l1157"></a>for by that means they became pretty vivid, only the first yellowish red, like <a id="l1158"></a>the blue in the fourth observation, was so little and faint as scarcely to be dis<a id="l1159"></a>cerned. Comparing the coloured rings made by reflection with these made by <a id="l1160"></a>transmission of the light, I found, that white was opposite to black, red to blue, <a id="l1161"></a>yellow to violet, and green to a compound of red and violet; that is, those <a id="l1162"></a>parts of the glass were black when, looked through, which when looked upon <a id="l1163"></a>appeared white, and on the contrary; and so those, which in one case exhibited <a id="l1164"></a>blue, did in the other case exhibit red; and the like of the other colours.</p>
<p id="par84">Obs. 10. Wetting the object-glass a little at their edges, the water crept in <a id="l1165"></a>slowly between them, and the circles thereby became less, and the colours <a id="l1166"></a>more faint; insomuch that, as the water crept along, one half of them, at which <a id="l1167"></a>it first arrived, would appear broken off from the other half, and contracted <a id="l1168"></a>into a less room. By measuring them I found the proportion of their diameters <a id="l1169"></a>to the diameters of the like circles made by air, to be about seven to eight; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p277"> &lt;277&gt; </span>and consequently the intervals of the glasses at like circles, caused by these two <a id="l1170"></a>mediums, water and air, are as about three to four. Perhaps it may be a general <a id="l1171"></a>rule, that if any other medium, more or less dense than water, be compressed <a id="l1172"></a>between the glasses, their interval at the rings, caused thereby, will be to their <a id="l1173"></a>interval, caused by interjacent air, as the sines are, which measure the refrac<a id="l1174"></a>tion made out of that medium into air.</p>
<p id="par85">Obs. 11. When the water was between the glasses, if I pressed the upper <a id="l1175"></a>glass variously at its edges to make the rings move nimbly from one place to <a id="l1176"></a>another, a little bright spot would immediately follow the center of them, <a id="l1177"></a>which, upon creeping in of the ambient water into that place, would presently <a id="l1178"></a>vanish. Its appearance was such, as interjacent air would have caused, and it <a id="l1179"></a>exhibited the same colours; but it was not air, for where any aereal bubbles <a id="l1180"></a>were in the water they would not vanish. The reflection must rather have been <a id="l1181"></a>caused by a subtiler medium, which could recede through the glass at the <a id="l1182"></a>creeping in of the water.</p>
<p id="par86">Obs. 12. These observations were made in the open air. But further, to <a id="l1183"></a>examine the effects of coloured light falling on the glasses, I darkened the <a id="l1184"></a>room, and viewed them by reflection of the colours of a prism cast on a sheet <a id="l1185"></a>of white paper; and by this means the rings became distincter, and visible to <a id="l1186"></a>a far greater number than in the open air.</p>
<p id="par87">I have seen more than twenty of them, whereas in the open air I could not <a id="l1187"></a>discern above eight or nine.</p>
<p id="par88">Obs. 13. Appointing an assistant to move the prism to and fro about its <a id="l1188"></a>axis, that all its colours might successively fall on the same place of the paper, <a id="l1189"></a>and be reflected from the circles to my eye whilst I held it immoveable; I <a id="l1190"></a>found the circles, which the red light made, to be manifestly bigger than <a id="l1191"></a>those, which were made by the blue and violet; and it was very pleasant to see <a id="l1192"></a>them gradually swell or contract, accordingly as the colour of the light was <a id="l1193"></a>changed. The interval of the glass at any of the rings, when they were made <a id="l1194"></a>by the utmost red light, was to their interval at the same ring, when made <a id="l1195"></a>by the utmost violet, greater than three to two, and less than thirteen to eight. <a id="l1196"></a>By the most of my observations it was as nine to fourteen. And this pro<a id="l1197"></a>portion seemed very nearly the same in all obliquities of my eye, unless when <a id="l1198"></a>two prisms were made use of instead of the object-glasses: for then, at a <a id="l1199"></a>certain great obliquity, the rings made by the several colours seemed equal; <a id="l1200"></a>and, at a greater obliquity, those made by the violet would be greater than the <a id="l1201"></a>same rings made by the red.</p>
<p id="par89">Obs. 14. While the prism was turned about uniformly, the contraction or <a id="l1202"></a>dilation of a ring made by alll the several colours of the prism successively <a id="l1203"></a>reflected from the object-glasses, was swiftest in the red, slowest in the violet, <a id="l1204"></a>and in intermediate colours it had intermediate degrees of celerity. Comparing <a id="l1205"></a>the extent, which each colour obtained by this contraction or <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>dilation,<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> I found, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p278"> &lt;278&gt; </span>that the blue was sensibly more extended than the violet, the yellow than the <a id="l1206"></a>blue, and the red than the yellow. And, to make a juster estimation of their <a id="l1207"></a>proportions, I observed, that the extent of the red was almost double to that <a id="l1208"></a>of the violet, and that the light was of a middle colour between yellow and <a id="l1209"></a>green at that interval of the glasses, which was an arithmetical mean between <a id="l1210"></a>the two extremes; contrary to what happens in the colours made by the re<a id="l1211"></a>fraction of a prism, where the red is most contracted, the violet most expanded, <a id="l1212"></a>and in the midst of them is the confine of green and blue.</p>
<p id="par90">Obs. 15. These rings were not of various colours, like those in the open <a id="l1213"></a>air, but appeared all over of that prismatic colour only, with which they were <a id="l1214"></a>illuminated: and, by projecting the prismatic colours immediately upon the <a id="l1215"></a>glasses, I found, that the light, which fell on the dark spaces, which were be<a id="l1216"></a>tween the coloured rings, was transmitted through the glasses without any va<a id="l1217"></a>riation of colour. For, on a white paper placed behind, it would paint rings <a id="l1218"></a>of the same colour with those, which were reflected, and of the bigness of their <a id="l1219"></a>intermediate spaces. And from hence the origin of these rings is manifest, <a id="l1220"></a>namely, that the aereal interval of the glasses, according to its various thick<a id="l1221"></a>ness, is disposed in some places to reflect, and in others to transmit, the light <a id="l1222"></a>of any colour; and, in the same place to reflect one colour, where it transmits <a id="l1223"></a>another.</p>
</div>
<div><p id="par91">These observations so well pleased the Society, that they ordered Mr. OLDEN<a id="l1224"></a>BURG to desire Mr. NEWTON to permit them to be published, together with the <a id="l1225"></a>rest; which, they presumed, did correspond with those, that had been now read <a id="l1226"></a>to them.</p>
<p id="par92">Besides, there was read a passage of Mr. NEWTON'S letter to Mr. OLDENBURG, <a id="l1227"></a>of 21 December, 1675, stating the difference between his hypothesis and that of <a id="l1228"></a>Mr. HOOKE. Which passage was as follows:</p>
</div><div>
<p id="par93">As for Mr. HOOKE'S insinuation, that the sum of the hypothesis I sent you <a id="l1229"></a>had been delivered by him in his Micrography, I need not much be concerned <a id="l1230"></a>at the liberty he takes in that kind: yet, because you think it may do well, <a id="l1231"></a>if I state the difference I take to be between them, I shall do it as briefly as I <a id="l1232"></a>can, and that the rather, that I may avoid the favour of having done any <a id="l1233"></a>thing unjustifiable or unhandsome towards Mr. HOOKE. But, for this end, I <a id="l1234"></a>must first (to see what is his) cast out what he has borrowed from DES CAR<a id="l1235"></a>TES, or others, viz. that there is an æthereal medium; that light is the action <a id="l1236"></a>of this medium; that this medium is less implicated in the parts of solid <a id="l1237"></a>bodies, and so moves more freely in them, and transmits light more readily <a id="l1238"></a>through them, and that after such a manner, as to accelerate the rays in a cer<a id="l1239"></a>tain proportion; that refraction arises from this acceleration, and has sines <a id="l1240"></a>proportional; that light is at first uniform; that its colours are some distur<a id="l1241"></a>bance or new modification of its rays by refraction or reflection; that the co<a id="l1242"></a>lours of a prism are made by means of the quiescent medium, accelerating <a id="l1243"></a>some motion of the rays on one side, where red appears, and retarding it on <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p279"> &lt;279&gt; </span>the other side, where blue appears; and, that there are but these two original <a id="l1244"></a>colours, or colour-making modifications of light, which by their various de<a id="l1245"></a>grees, or, as Mr. HOOKE calls it, dilutings, produce all intermediate ones. <a id="l1246"></a>This rejected, the remainder of his hypothesis is, that he has changed DES <a id="l1247"></a>CARTES'S pressing or progressive motion of the medium to a vibrating one, the <a id="l1248"></a>rotation of the globuli to the obligation of pulses, and the accelerating their <a id="l1249"></a>rotation on the one hand, and retarding it on the other, by the quiescent me<a id="l1250"></a>dium, to produce colours, to the like action of the medium on the two ends of <a id="l1251"></a>his pulses for the same end. And having thus far modified his by the Carte<a id="l1252"></a>sian hypothesis, he has extended it further, to explicate the phænomena of thin <a id="l1253"></a>plates, and added another explication of the colours of natural bodies, fluid <a id="l1254"></a>and solid.</p>
<p id="par94">This, I think, is in short the sum of his hypothesis; and in all this I have <a id="l1255"></a>nothing in common with him, but the supposition, that æther is a suscep<a id="l1256"></a>tible medium of vibrations, of which supposition I make a very different use; <a id="l1257"></a>he supposing it a light itself, which I suppose it is not. This is as great a dif<a id="l1258"></a>ference as is between him and DES CARTES. But besides this, the manner of <a id="l1259"></a>refraction and reflection, and the nature and production of colours in all cases <a id="l1260"></a>(which takes up the body of my discourse) I explain very differently from <a id="l1261"></a>him; and even in the colours of thin transparent substances, I explain every <a id="l1262"></a>thing after a way so differing from him, that the experiments I ground my <a id="l1263"></a>discourse on, destroy all he has said about them; and the two main experi<a id="l1264"></a>ments, without which the manner of the production of those colours is not to <a id="l1265"></a>be found out, were not only unknown to him, when he wrote his Microgra<a id="l1266"></a>phy, but even last spring, as I understood, in mentioning them to him. This <a id="l1267"></a>therefore is the sum of what is common to us, that æther may vibrate; and <a id="l1268"></a>so, if he thinks fit to use that notion of colours, arising from the various big<a id="l1269"></a>ness of pulses (without which his hypothesis will do nothing) <em>his</em> will borrow <a id="l1270"></a>as much from my answer to his objections, as that I send you does from his <a id="l1271"></a>Micrography.</p>
<p id="par95">But, it may be, he means, that I have made use of his observations, and of <a id="l1272"></a>some I did; as, that of the inflection of rays, for which I quoted him; that <a id="l1273"></a>of opacity, arising from the interstices of the parts of bodies, which I insist <a id="l1274"></a>not on; and that of plated bodies exhibiting colours, a phænomenon, for the <a id="l1275"></a>notice of which I thank him. But he left me to find out and make such ex<a id="l1276"></a>periments about it, as might inform me of the manner of the production of those <a id="l1277"></a>colours, to ground an hypothesis on; he having given no further insight to it <a id="l1278"></a>than this, that the colour depended on some certain thickness of the plate; <a id="l1279"></a>though what that thickness was at every colour, he confesses in his Microgra<a id="l1280"></a>phy, he had attempted in vain to learn; and therefore, seeing I was left to <a id="l1281"></a>measure it myself, I suppose he will allow me to make use of what I took <a id="l1282"></a>the pains to find out. And this I hope may vindicate me from what Mr. <a id="l1283"></a>HOOKE has been pleased to charge me with.</p>
</div>
<div><p id="par96">The reading of the rest of Mr. NEWTON'S discourse was referred to the next <a id="l1284"></a>meeting.</p>

Mr. OLDENBURG produced from his highness prince RUPERT a <a id="l1285"></a>piece of marble, having several pictures of boys and trees painted upon it in such <a id="l1286"></a>a manner, that all the out-lines of the pictures were exactly defined without any <a id="l1287"></a>flowing of the colours abroad, and the colours fixed by the fire, and afterwards <a id="l1288"></a>so polished, that they would be permanent, and last as long as the marble.</p>
<p id="par98">This was acknowledged by the members to be a very great improvement of <a id="l1289"></a>what had been done at Oxford by a certain stone-cutter there; and that all, that <a id="l1290"></a>had been performed before in this art, was not comparable to this degree of im<a id="l1291"></a>provement.</p>
<p id="par99">Mr. HOOKE remarked, that he conceived, that there were but two colours in <a id="l1292"></a>this piece; and that he had a method of doing it with most colours, and to paint <a id="l1293"></a>with them upon marble almost as curiously as with a pencil.</p>

<span class="pagenumber" id="p281"> &lt;281&gt; </span>
<p id="par106">The precedent observations were made with a rarer thin medium terminated <a id="l1315"></a>by a denser, such as was air or water compressed betwixt two glasses. In <a id="l1316"></a>those, that follow, are set down the appearances of a denser medium thinned <a id="l1317"></a>within a rarer; such as are the plates of Muscovy-glass, bubbles of water, and <a id="l1318"></a>some others thin substances terminated on all sides with air.</p>
<p id="par107">Obs. 17. If a bubble be blown with water, first made tenacious by dissolv<a id="l1319"></a>ing a little soap in it, it is a common observation, that after a while it will <a id="l1320"></a>appear tinged with a great variety of colours. To defend these bubbles from <a id="l1321"></a>being agitated by the external air (whereby their colours are irregularly moved <a id="l1322"></a>one among another, so that no accurate observation can be made of them) as <a id="l1323"></a>soon as I had blown any of them, I covered it with a clear glass, and by that <a id="l1324"></a>means its colours emerged in a very regular order, like so many concentric <a id="l1325"></a>rings incompassing the top of the bubble. And as the bubble grew thinner <a id="l1326"></a>by the continual subsiding of the water, these rings dilated slowly, and over<a id="l1327"></a>spread the whole bubble, descending in order to the bottom of it, where they <a id="l1328"></a>vanished successively. In the mean while, after all the colours were emerged <a id="l1329"></a>at the top, there grew in the center of the rings a small, round, black spot, <a id="l1330"></a>like that in the first observation, which continually dilated itself, till it became <a id="l1331"></a>sometimes more than one half or three fourths of an inch in breadth, before the <a id="l1332"></a>bubble broke. At first I thought there had been no light reflected from the water <a id="l1333"></a>in that place; but observing it more curiously, I saw within it several smaller, <a id="l1334"></a>round spots, which appeared much blacker and darker than the rest, whereby <a id="l1335"></a>I knew, that there was some reflection at the other places, which were not so <a id="l1336"></a>dark as those spots. And by further trial I found, that I could see the images <a id="l1337"></a>(as of a candle or the sun) very faintly reflected, not only from the great black <a id="l1338"></a>spot, but also from the little darker spots, which were within it.</p>
<p id="par108">Besides the aforesaid coloured rings, there would often appear small spots of <a id="l1339"></a>colours ascending and descending up and down the side of the bubble, by rea<a id="l1340"></a>son of some inequalities in the subsiding of the water; and sometimes small black <a id="l1341"></a>spots generated at the sides, would ascend up to the larger black spot at the <a id="l1342"></a>top of the bubble, and unite with it.</p>
<p id="par109">Obs. 18. Because the colours of these bubbles were more extended and <a id="l1343"></a>lively than those of air thinned between two glasses, and so more easy to be <a id="l1344"></a>distinguished, I shall here give you a further description of their order, as they <a id="l1345"></a>were observed in viewing them by reflection of the skies, when of a white <a id="l1346"></a>colour, whilst a black substance was placed behind the bubble: and they were <a id="l1347"></a>these; red, blue, red, blue; red, blue; red, green; red, yellow; green, blue, <a id="l1348"></a>purple; red, yellow, green, blue, violet; red, yellow, white, blue, black.</p>
<p id="par110">The three first successions of red and blue were very dilute and dirty, espe<a id="l1349"></a>cially the first, where the red seemed in a manner to be white. Amongst these <a id="l1350"></a>there was scarcely any other colour sensible, only the blues (and principally the <a id="l1351"></a>second blue) inclined a little to green.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p282"> &lt;282&gt; </span>
<p id="par111">The fourth red was also dilute and dirty, but not so much as the former <a id="l1352"></a>three: after that succeeded little or no yellow, but a copious green, which at <a id="l1353"></a>first was inclined a little to yellow, and then became a pretty brisk and good <a id="l1354"></a>willow green, and afterwards changed to a blueish colour; but there succeded <a id="l1355"></a>neither blue nor violet.</p>
<p id="par112">The fifth red at first was very much inclined to purple, and afterwards be<a id="l1356"></a>came more bright and brisk, but yet not very pure. This was succeeded with <a id="l1357"></a>a very bright and intense yellow, which was but little in quantity, and soon <a id="l1358"></a>changed to green; but that green was copious, and something more pure, <a id="l1359"></a>deep, and lively, than the former green. After that followed an excellent blue <a id="l1360"></a>of a bright sky colour; and then a purple, which was less in quantity than the <a id="l1361"></a>blue, and much inclined to red.</p>
<p id="par113">The sixth red was at first of a very fair and lively scarlet, and soon after <a id="l1362"></a>of a brighter colour, being very pure and brisk, and the best of all the reds. <a id="l1363"></a>Then, after a lively orange, followed an intense, bright, and copious yellow, <a id="l1364"></a>which was also the best of all the yellows; and this changed, first to a greenish <a id="l1365"></a>yellow, and then to a greenish blue; but the green between the yellow and <a id="l1366"></a>blue was very little and dilute, seeming rather a greenish white than a green. <a id="l1367"></a>The blue, which succeeded, became very good, and of a fair, bright, sky colour; <a id="l1368"></a>but yet something inferior to the former blue: and the violet was intense and <a id="l1369"></a>deep, with little or no redness in it, and less in quantity than the blue.</p>
<p id="par114">In the last red appeared a tincture of scarlet next the violet, which soon <a id="l1370"></a>changed to a brighter colour, inclining to an orange: and the yellow, which <a id="l1371"></a>followed, was at first pretty good and lively, but afterwards it grew more and <a id="l1372"></a>more dilute, until by degrees it ended in perfect whiteness: and this whiteness, <a id="l1373"></a>if the water was very tenacious and well tempered, would slowly spread and <a id="l1374"></a>dilate itself over the greatest part of the bubble, continually growing paler at <a id="l1375"></a>the top, where at length it would crack, and those cracks, as they dilated, <a id="l1376"></a>would appear of a pretty good, but yet obscure and dark, sky-colour; the <a id="l1377"></a>white between the blue spots diminishing, until it resembled the threads of an <a id="l1378"></a>irregular net-work, and soon after vanished and left all the upper part of the <a id="l1379"></a>bubble of the said dark blue colour; and this colour, after the aforesaid man<a id="l1380"></a>ner, dilated itself downwards, until sometimes it hath overspread the whole <a id="l1381"></a>bubble. In the mean while, at the top, which was of a darker blue than the <a id="l1382"></a>bottom, and appeared also of many round blue spots, something darker than <a id="l1383"></a>the rest, there would emerge one or more very black spots, and within those, <a id="l1384"></a>other spots of an intenser blackness, which I mentioned in the former observa<a id="l1385"></a>tion; and those continually dilated themselves until the bubble broke.</p>
<p id="par115">If the water was not very tenacious, the black spots would break forth in <a id="l1386"></a>the white, without any sensible intervention of the blue: and sometimes they <a id="l1387"></a>would break forth within the precedent yellow, or red, or perhaps within <a id="l1388"></a>the blue of the second order, before the intermediate colours had time to dis<a id="l1389"></a>play themselves.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p283"> &lt;283&gt; </span>
<p id="par116">By this description you may perceive, how great an affinity these colours <a id="l1390"></a>have with those of air, described in the fourth observation, although set down <a id="l1391"></a>in a contrary order, by reason that they begin to appear, when the bubble is <a id="l1392"></a>thickest, and are most conveniently reckoned from the lowest and thickest part <a id="l1393"></a>of the bubble upwards.</p>
<p id="par117">Obs. 19. Viewing, at several oblique positions of my eye, the rings of <a id="l1394"></a>colours emerging on the top of the bubble, I found, that they were sensibly <a id="l1395"></a>dilated by increasing the obliquity, but yet not so much by far, as those made <a id="l1396"></a>by thinned air in the seventh observation. For there they distended so much, <a id="l1397"></a>as, when viewed most obliquely, to arrive at a part of the plate more than <a id="l1398"></a>twelve lines thicker than that where they appeared, when viewed perpendicu<a id="l1399"></a>larly; whereas in this case the thickness of the water, at which they arrived <a id="l1400"></a>when viewed most obliquely, was, to that thickness, which exhibited them by <a id="l1401"></a>perpendicular rays, something less than eight to five. By the best of my ob<a id="l1402"></a>servations, it was between fifteen and fifteen and a half to ten, an increase <a id="l1403"></a>about twenty-four times less than in the other case.</p>
<p id="par118">Sometimes the bubble would become of an uniform thickness all over, ex<a id="l1404"></a>cept at the top of it near the black spot, as I knew, because it would exhibit <a id="l1405"></a>the same appearance of colours in all positions of the eye; and then the co<a id="l1406"></a>lours, which were seen at its apparent circumference by the obliquest rays, <a id="l1407"></a>would be different from those, that were seen in other places by rays less <a id="l1408"></a>oblique to it. And divers spectators might see the same part of it by differing <a id="l1409"></a>colours, by viewing it at very differing obliquities. Now, observing how <a id="l1410"></a>much the colours at the same place of the bubble, or at divers places of equal <a id="l1411"></a>thickness, were varied by the several obliquities of the rays, by assistance of <a id="l1412"></a>the fourth, fourteenth, sixteenth, and eighteenth onservations, as they are <a id="l1413"></a>hereafter explained, I collected the thickness of the water, requisite to exhibit <a id="l1414"></a>any one the same colour at several obliquities, to be very nearly in the proportion expressed in this table.</p>

<p id="par119">In the two first columns are expressed the obliquities of the rays to the <a id="l1419"></a>superficies of the water; that is, their angles of incidence and refraction; <a id="l1420"></a>where, I suppose, that the lines, which measure them, are in round numbers, <a id="l1421"></a>as three to four, though probably the dissolution of soap in the water may a <a id="l1422"></a>little alter its refractive virtue. In the third column the thickness of the bubble, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p284"> &lt;284&gt; </span>at which any one colour is exhibited in those several obliquities, is exprest in <a id="l1423"></a>parts, of which ten constitute that thickness, when the rays are perpendicular.</p>
<p id="par120">I have sometimes observed of the colours, which arise on polished steel by <a id="l1424"></a>heating it, or on bell metal and some other metalline substances, when melted <a id="l1425"></a>and poured on the ground, where it may cool in the open air, that they have, <a id="l1426"></a>like those of water-bubbles, been a little changed by viewing them at divers <a id="l1427"></a>obliquities; and particularly, that a deep blue or violet, when viewed very <a id="l1428"></a>obliquely, hath been changed to a deep red. But the changes of these colours <a id="l1429"></a>are not so sensible as of those made by water; for the scoria, or vitrified part <a id="l1430"></a>of the metal, which most metals, when heated or melted, continually protrude <a id="l1431"></a>to their surface, where, by covering them in form of a thin glassy skin, it <a id="l1432"></a>causes these colours, is much denser than water, and I find, that the change <a id="l1433"></a>made by the obliquation of the eye, is least in colours of the densest thin sub<a id="l1434"></a>stances.</p>
<p id="par121">Obs. 20. As in the ninth observation, so here, the bubble, by transmitted <a id="l1435"></a>light appeared of a contrary colour to that, which it exhibited by reflection.<a id="l1436"></a>Thus, when the bubbles, being looked on by the light of the clouds reflected <a id="l1437"></a>from it, seemed red at its apparent circumference, if the clouds at the same <a id="l1438"></a>time, or very suddenly, were viewed through it, the colour at its circumfe<a id="l1439"></a>rence would be blue. And, on the contrary, when by reflected light it ap<a id="l1440"></a>peared blue, it would appear red by transmitted light.</p>
<p id="par122">Obs. 21. By wetting plates of Muscovy-glass, whose thinness made the like <a id="l1441"></a>colours appear, the colours became more faint, especially by wetting the plates <a id="l1442"></a>on that side opposite the eye; but I could not perceive any variation of their <a id="l1443"></a>species. So that the thickness of a plate requisite to produce any colour, de<a id="l1444"></a>pends only on the density of the plate, and not of the ambient medium. <a id="l1445"></a>And hence, by the tenth and sixteenth observations, may be known the thick<a id="l1446"></a>ness of bubbles of water or plates of Muscovy-glass, or of any other substan<a id="l1447"></a>ces, which they have at any colour produced by them.</p>
<p id="par123">Obs. 22. A thin transparent body, which is denser than its ambient me<a id="l1448"></a>dium, exhibits more brisk and vivid colours than that, which is so much <a id="l1449"></a>rarer; as I have particularly observed in air and glass: for, blowing glass <a id="l1450"></a>very thin at a lamp furnace, those plates encompassed with air did exhibit co<a id="l1451"></a>lours much more vivid than those of air made thin between two glasses.</p>
<p id="par124">Obs. 23. Comparing the quantity of light reflected from the several rings, <a id="l1452"></a>I found it was most copious from the first or inmost, and in the exterior rings be<a id="l1453"></a>came gradually less and less. Also the whiteness of the first ring was stronger than <a id="l1454"></a>that reflected from those parts of the thinned medium, which were without the <a id="l1455"></a>rings, as I could manifestly perceive by viewing at distance the rings made by <a id="l1456"></a>the two object glasses; or by comparing two bubbles of water blown at distant <a id="l1457"></a>times, in the first of which the whiteness appeared, which succeeded the colours, <a id="l1458"></a>and the whiteness, which preceded them, in the other.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p285"> &lt;285&gt; </span>
<p id="par125">Obs. 24. When the two object-glasses were laid upon one another, so as to <a id="l1459"></a>make the rings of colours appear, though with my naked eye I could not <a id="l1460"></a>discern above eight or nine of those rings, yet, by viewing them through a <a id="l1461"></a>prism, I have seen a far greater multitude, insomuch, that I could number <a id="l1462"></a>more than forty, besides many others, that were so very small and close toge<a id="l1463"></a>ther, that I could not keep my eye so steady on them severally as to number <a id="l1464"></a>them: but by their extent I have sometimes estimated them to be more than <a id="l1465"></a>a hundred. And, I believe, the experiment may be improved to the discovery <a id="l1466"></a>of far greater numbers; for they seem to be really unlimited, though visible <a id="l1467"></a>only so far as they can be separated by the refraction, as I shall hereafter <a id="l1468"></a>explain.</p>
<p id="par126">But it was but one side of these rings, namely, that, towards which the re<a id="l1469"></a>fraction was made, which by that refraction was rendered distinct; and the <a id="l1470"></a>other side became more confused than to the naked eye, insomuch that there I <a id="l1471"></a>could not discern above one or two, and sometimes none of those rings, of <a id="l1472"></a>which I could discern eight or nine with my naked eye. And their segments, <a id="l1473"></a>or arcs, which on the other side appeared so numerous, for the most part ex<a id="l1474"></a>ceeded not the third part of a circle. If the refraction was very great, or the <a id="l1475"></a>prisms very distant from the object-glasses, the middle part of those arcs be<a id="l1476"></a>came also confused, so as to disappear and constitue an even whiteness, whilst <a id="l1477"></a>on either side their ends, as also the whole arcs farthest <a id="l1478"></a>from the center, became distincter than before, appearing <a id="l1479"></a>in the form you see them here designed.</p>
<p id="par127">The arcs, where they seemed distinctest, were only white <a id="l1480"></a>and black successively, without any other colours in<a id="l1481"></a>termixed. But in other places there appeared colours <a id="l1482"></a>whose order was inverted by the refraction, in such man<a id="l1483"></a>ner, that, if I first held the prism very near the object-<a id="l1484"></a>glasses, and then gradually removed it farther off towards <a id="l1485"></a>my eye, the colours of the second, third, fourth, and following rings shrunk <a id="l1486"></a>towards the white, that emerged between them, until they wholly vanished into <a id="l1487"></a>it at the middle of the arcs, and afterwards emerged again in a contrary or<a id="l1488"></a>der: but at the end of the arcs they retained their order unchanged.</p>
<p id="par128">I have sometimes so laid one object-glass upon the other, that, to the naked <a id="l1489"></a>eye, they have all over seemed uniformly white, without the least appearance <a id="l1490"></a>of any of the coloured rings; and yet, by viewing them through a prism, great <a id="l1491"></a>multitudes of those rings have discovered themselves. And, in like manner, <a id="l1492"></a>plates of Muscovy glass, and bubbles of glass blown at a lamp furnace, <a id="l1493"></a>which were not so thin, as to exhibit any colours to the naked eye, have <a id="l1494"></a>through the prism exhibited a great variety of them, ranged irregularly up <a id="l1495"></a>and down, in the form of waves. And so bubbles of water, before they be<a id="l1496"></a>gan to exhibit their colours to the naked eye of a by-stander, have appeared, <a id="l1497"></a>through a prism, girded about with many parallel and horizontal rings; to pro<a id="l1498"></a>duce which effect, it was necessary to hold the prism parallel, or very nearly paral<a id="l1499"></a>lel, to the horizon, and to dispose it so, that the rays might be refracted upwards.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p286"> &lt;286&gt; </span>
<p id="par129">Having given my observations of these colours, before I make use of them <a id="l1500"></a>to unfold the causes of the colours of natural bodies, it is convenient, that, by <a id="l1501"></a>the simplest of them, I first explain the more compounded; such as are the <a id="l1502"></a>second, third, fourth, ninth, twelfth, eighteenth, twentieth, and twenty-fourth.</p>
<p id="par130">And first, to show how the colours in the fourth and eighteenth observations <a id="l1503"></a>are produced, let there be taken in any <a id="l1504"></a>right line the lengths Y Z, Y A, and <a id="l1505"></a>Y H, in proportion as four, nine, and <a id="l1506"></a>fourteen; and between Z A and Z H <a id="l1507"></a>eleven mean proportionals, of which let <a id="l1508"></a>Z B be the second, Z C the third, Z D <a id="l1509"></a>the fifth, Z E the seventh, Z F the ninth, <a id="l1510"></a>and Z G the tenth.

<p id="par131">Now, if A 2 be supposed to represent the <a id="l1521"></a>thickness of any thin transparent body, <a id="l1522"></a>at which the utmost violet is most copi<a id="l1523"></a>ously reflected in the first ring or series of <a id="l1524"></a>colours, then, by the thirteenth observa<a id="l1525"></a>tion, H K will represent its thickness, at <a id="l1526"></a>which the utmost red is most copiously <a id="l1527"></a>reflected in the same series. Also, by the <a id="l1528"></a>fifth and sixteenth observations, A 6, and <a id="l1529"></a>H <em>n</em>, will denote the thickness at which <a id="l1530"></a>those extreme colours are most copiously <a id="l1531"></a>reflected in the second series, and so on. <a id="l1532"></a>And the thickness, at which any of the <a id="l1533"></a>intermediate colours are reflected most <a id="l1534"></a>copiously, will, according to the four<a id="l1535"></a>teenth observation, be defined by the in<a id="l1536"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p287"> &lt;287&gt; </span>termediate parts of the lines 2 K, 6 <em>n</em>, &amp;c. against which the names of those <a id="l1537"></a>colours are written below.</p>
<p id="par132">But farther, to define the latitude of these colours in each ring or series, let <a id="l1538"></a>A 1 design the least thickness, and A 3 the greatest thickness, at which the <a id="l1539"></a>extreme violet in the first series is reflected; and let H I and H L design the <a id="l1540"></a>like limit for the extreme red, and the intermediate colours be limited by the <a id="l1541"></a>intermediate parts of the lines, 1 I and 3 L; against which the names of those <a id="l1542"></a>colours are written. And in the second series, let those limits be the lines <a id="l1543"></a>5 M and 7 O; and so on: but yet with this caution, that the reflections be <a id="l1544"></a>supposed strongest at the intermediate spaces, 2 K, 6 N, 10 R, &amp;c. and to <a id="l1545"></a>decrease gradually towards these limits, 1 I, 3 L; 5 M, 7 O, &amp;c. on either <a id="l1546"></a>side, where you must not conceive them to be precisely limited, but to decay <a id="l1547"></a>indefinitely. And whereas I have designed the same latitude to every series, I <a id="l1548"></a>did it, because, although the colours in the first series seem to be a little broader <a id="l1549"></a>than the rest, by reason of a stronger reflection there; yet that inequality is so <a id="l1550"></a>insensible as scarcely to be determined by observation.</p>
<p id="par133">Now, according to this description, conceiving, that the rays, in which seve<a id="l1551"></a>ral colours in here, are by turns reflected at the space 1 K, 3 L, 5 M, O 7, <a id="l1552"></a>9 P, R 11, &amp;c. and transmitted at the spaces A H I 1, 3 L, M 5, 7 O, <a id="l1553"></a>P 9, &amp;c. it is easy to know what colour in the open air must be exhibited <a id="l1554"></a>at any thickness of a transparent thin body. For, if a ruler be applied paral<a id="l1555"></a>lel to A H, at that distance from it by which the thickness of the body is <a id="l1556"></a>represented, the alternate spaces 1 I, L 3, 5 M, O 7, &amp;c. which it crosseth, <a id="l1557"></a>will denote the reflected original colours, of which the colour exhibited in the <a id="l1558"></a>open air is compounded. Thus, if the constitution of the green in the third <a id="l1559"></a>series of colours be desired; apply the ruler, as you see, at <span class="greek">π ρ σ φ</span>, and by its <a id="l1560"></a>passing through some of the blue at <span class="greek">π</span>, and yellow at <span class="greek">σ</span>, as well as through the <a id="l1561"></a>green <span class="greek">ρ</span>, you may conclude, that green, exhibited at that thickness of the <a id="l1562"></a>body, is principally constituted of original green, but not without a mixture <a id="l1563"></a>of some blue and yellow. By this means you may know, how the colours <a id="l1564"></a>from the center of the rings outwards ought to succeed in order, as they were <a id="l1565"></a>described in the fourth and eighteenth observations: for, if you move the ruler <a id="l1566"></a>gradually from A H through all distances, having past over the first space, <a id="l1567"></a>which denotes little or no reflection to be made by thinnest substances, it will first <a id="l1568"></a>arrive at 1, the violet, and then very quickly at the blue and green, which, to<a id="l1569"></a>gether with that violet compounded blue, and then at the yellow and red, by <a id="l1570"></a>whose further addition, that blue is converted into whiteness, which white<a id="l1571"></a>ness continues during the transit from I to 3; and after that, by the successive <a id="l1572"></a>deficience of its component colours, turns first to compound yellow, and then <a id="l1573"></a>to red, and last of all the red ceaseth at L Then begin the colours of the second <a id="l1574"></a>series, which succeed in order between 5 and O, and are more lively than be<a id="l1575"></a>fore, because more expanded and severed. And, for the same reason, instead of <a id="l1576"></a>the former white, there intercedes between the blue and yellow a mixture of <a id="l1577"></a>orange, yellow, green, blue and indico, all which together ought to exhibit <a id="l1578"></a>a dilute and imperfect green. So the colours of the third series all succeed in <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p288"> &lt;288&gt; </span>order; first the violet, which a little interferes with the red of the second or<a id="l1579"></a>der, and is thereby inclined to a redish purple; then the blue and green, which <a id="l1580"></a>are less mixed with other colours, and consequently more lively than before, <a id="l1581"></a>especially the green. Then follows the yellow, some of which towards the <a id="l1582"></a>green is distinct and good; but that part of it towards the succeeding red, as <a id="l1583"></a>also that red, is mixed with the violet and blue of the fourth series, whereby va<a id="l1584"></a>rious degrees of red, very much inclining to purple, are compounded. The <a id="l1585"></a>violet and blue, which should succeed this red, being mixed with, and hidden <a id="l1586"></a>in it, there succeeds a green; and this at first is much inclined to blue, but <a id="l1587"></a>soon decomes a good green; the only unmixed and lively colour in this fourth <a id="l1588"></a>series: for as it verges towards the yellow, it begins to interfere with the <a id="l1589"></a>colours of the fifth series, by whose mixture the succeeding yellow and red are <a id="l1590"></a>very much diluted, and made dirty, especially the yellow, which being the <a id="l1591"></a>weaker colour, is scarce able to shew itself. After this the several series inter<a id="l1592"></a>fere more and more, and their colours become more and more intermixed, till <a id="l1593"></a>after three or four revolutions (in which the red and blue predominate by <a id="l1594"></a>turns) all sorts of colours are in all places pretty equally blended, and com<a id="l1595"></a>pound one even whiteness.</p>
<p id="par134">And since, by the fifteenth observation, the rays indued with one colour are <a id="l1596"></a>transmitted, where those of another colour are reflected, the reason of the co<a id="l1597"></a>lours made by the transmitted light, in the ninth and twentieth observations, is <a id="l1598"></a>also from hence evident.</p>
<p id="par135">If not only the order and species of these colours, but also the precise thick<a id="l1599"></a>ness of the plate, or thin body, at which they are exhibited, be desired in parts <a id="l1600"></a>of an inch, that may be also performed by assistance of the sixth or sixteenth <a id="l1601"></a>observation. For, according to those observations, the thickness of the thinned <a id="l1602"></a>air, which, between two glasses, exhibited the orange or bright red of the <a id="l1603"></a>sixth order, was <span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-34-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>14554</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-166" style="width: 2.065em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 2.126em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.353em, 1002.13em, 3.067em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-167"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-168"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 1.888em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.3em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -4.426em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-169" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">1</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.323em, 1001.75em, 4.204em, -1000em); top: -3.585em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.884em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-170" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">14554</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1001.89em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 1.888em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.475em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.412em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>14554</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-34"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>14554</mn></mfrac></math></script> parts of an inch.

On these <a id="l1616"></a>grounds I have composed the following table; wherein the thickness of air, <a id="l1617"></a>water, and glass, at which each colour is most intense and specific, is expressed <a id="l1618"></a>in parts of an inch divided into ten hundred thousand equal parts.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p289"> &lt;289&gt; </span>
<p id="par137">Now, if this table be compared with the third scheme, you will there see <a id="l1619"></a>the constitution of each colour, as to its ingredients, or the original colours, <a id="l1620"></a>of which it is compounded, and thence be enabled to judge of its intenseness <a id="l1621"></a>or imperfection, which may suffice in explication of the fourth and eighteenth <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p290"> &lt;290&gt; </span> observations, unless it be further desired to delineate the manner, how the <a id="l1622"></a>colours appear, when the two object-glasses are laid upon one another: to do <a id="l1623"></a>which let there be described a large arc of a circle and a strait line, which <a id="l1624"></a>may touch that arc; are parallel to that tangent several occult lines at such <a id="l1625"></a>distances from it, as the numbers set against the several colours in the table <a id="l1626"></a>denote. For the arc and its tangent will represent the superficies of the <a id="l1627"></a>glasses, terminating the interjacent air, and the places, where the occult lines <a id="l1628"></a>cut the arc, will show at what distances from the center, or point of the con<a id="l1629"></a>tact, each colour is reflected.</p>
<p id="par138">There are also other uses for this table; for by its assistance the thickness <a id="l1630"></a>of the bubble, in the nineteenth observation, was determined by the colours, <a id="l1631"></a>which it exhibited.

<p id="par139">To explain, in the next place, the circumstances of the second and third <a id="l1642"></a>observations, that is, how the colours (by turning the prisms about their com<a id="l1643"></a>mon axis the contrary way to that expressed in those observations) may be con<a id="l1644"></a>verted into white and black rings, and afterwards into colours again in an <a id="l1645"></a>inverted order; it must be remembered, that those colours are dilated by obli<a id="l1646"></a>quation of the rays to the air, which intercedes the glasses; and that, according <a id="l1647"></a>to the table in the seventh observation, their dilation or reflection from the <a id="l1648"></a>common center is most manifest and speedy when they are obliquest. Now, <a id="l1649"></a>the rays of yellow being more refracted by the first superficies of the said air <a id="l1650"></a>than those of red, are thereby made more oblique to the second superficies, <a id="l1651"></a>at which they are reflected, to produce the coloured rings; and consequently, <a id="l1652"></a>the yellow in each ring will be more dilated than the red; and the excess of <a id="l1653"></a>its dilation will be so much the greater, by how much the greater is the obli<a id="l1654"></a>quity of the rays, until at last it become of equal extent with the red of the <a id="l1655"></a>same ring. And, for the same reason, the green, blue, and violet, will be <a id="l1656"></a>also so much dilated by the still greater obliquity of their rays, as to become <a id="l1657"></a>all very nearly of equal extent with the red; that is, equally distant from the <a id="l1658"></a>center of the rings. And then all the colours of the same series must be coinci<a id="l1659"></a>dent, and by their mixture exhibit a white ring; and these white rings must <a id="l1660"></a>have black or dark rings between them, because they do not spread and inter<a id="l1661"></a>fere with one another as before; and, for that reason also, they must become <a id="l1662"></a>distincter, and visible to far greater numbers. But yet the violet, being <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p291"> &lt;291&gt; </span>obliquest, will be something more dilated in proportion than the other colours; <a id="l1663"></a>and so very apt to appear at the exterior verges of the white.</p>
<p id="par140">Afterwards, by a greater obliquity of the rays, the violet and the blue be<a id="l1664"></a>come sensibly more dilated than the red and yellow; and so being further <a id="l1665"></a>removed from the center of the rings, the colours must emerge out of the white <a id="l1666"></a>in an order contrary to that which they had before, the violet and blue at the <a id="l1667"></a>exterior limbs, and the red and yellow at the interior. And the violet, by <a id="l1668"></a>reason of the greatest obliquity of its rays, being, in proportion, most of all <a id="l1669"></a>expanded, will soonest appear at the exterior limb of each white ring, and <a id="l1670"></a>become more conspicuous than the rest. And the several series of colours, by <a id="l1671"></a>their unfolding and spreading, will begin again to interfere, and thereby render <a id="l1672"></a>the rings less distinct, and not visible to so great numbers.</p>
<p id="par141">If, instead of the prisms, the object-glasses be made use of, the rings, which <a id="l1673"></a>they exhibit, become not white and distinct by the obliquity of the eye, by <a id="l1674"></a>reason, that the rays, in their passage through that air, which interceded the <a id="l1675"></a>glasses, are very nearly parallel to themselves, when first incident on the glasses; <a id="l1676"></a>and consequently, those indued with several colours are not inclined one more <a id="l1677"></a>than another to that air, as it happens in the prisms.</p>
<p id="par142">There is yet another circumstance of these experiments to be considered; <a id="l1678"></a>and that is, why the black and white rings, which, when viewed at a distance, <a id="l1679"></a>appear distinct, should not only become confused by viewing them near at <a id="l1680"></a>hand, but also yield a violet colour at both the edges of every white ring: <a id="l1681"></a>and the reason is, that the rays, which enter the eye at several parts of the <a id="l1682"></a>pupil, have several obliquities to the glasses, and those, which are most oblique, <a id="l1683"></a>if considerd apart, would represent the rings bigger than those, which are the <a id="l1684"></a>least oblique. Whence the breadth of the perimeter of every white ring is ex<a id="l1685"></a>panded outwards by the obliquest rays, and inwards by the least oblique. And <a id="l1686"></a>this expansion is so much the greater, by how much the greater is the difference <a id="l1687"></a>of the obliquity; that is, by how much the pupil is wider, or the eye nearer <a id="l1688"></a>to the glasses: and the breadth of the violet must be most expanded, because <a id="l1689"></a>the rays, apt to excite a sensation of that colour, are most oblique to the <a id="l1690"></a>second or further superficies of the thinned air, at which they are reflected; <a id="l1691"></a>and have also the greatest variation of obliquity, which makes that colour <a id="l1692"></a>soonest emerge out of the edges of the white. And, as the breadth of every <a id="l1693"></a>ring is thus augmented, the dark intervals must be diminished, until the neigh<a id="l1694"></a>bouring rings become continuous, and are blended, the exterior first, and <a id="l1695"></a>then those nearer the center; so that they can no longer be distinguished a-part, <a id="l1696"></a>but seem to constitute an even and uniform whiteness.</p>
<p id="par143">Amongst all the observations there is none accompanied with so odd circum<a id="l1697"></a>stances as the twenty-fourth. Of those the principal are, that in thin plates, <a id="l1698"></a>which, to the naked eye, seem of an even and uniform transparent whiteness, <a id="l1699"></a>the refraction of a prism should make the rings of colours appear; whereas it <a id="l1700"></a>usually makes objects to appear coloured only, where they are terminated with <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p292"> &lt;292&gt; </span>shadows, or have parts unequally luminous; and that it should make those <a id="l1701"></a>rings exceedingly distinct and white, although it usually renders those objects <a id="l1702"></a>confused and coloured. The cause of these things you will understand by <a id="l1703"></a>considering, that all the rings of colours are really in the plate, when viewed <a id="l1704"></a>by the naked eye, although, by reason of the great breadth of their circum<a id="l1705"></a>ferences, they so much interfere, and are blended together, that they seem to <a id="l1706"></a>constitute an even whiteness. But, when the rays pass through the prism to <a id="l1707"></a>the eye, the orbits of the several colours in every ring are refracted, some more <a id="l1708"></a>than others, according to their degree of refrangibility; by which means the <a id="l1709"></a>colours on one side of the ring become more unfolded and dilated, and on the <a id="l1710"></a>other side more complicated and contracted. And where, by a due refrac<a id="l1711"></a>tion, they are so much contracted, that the several rings become narrower <a id="l1712"></a>than to interfere with one another, they must appear distinct, and also white, <a id="l1713"></a>if the constituent colours be so much contracted as to be wholly coinci<a id="l1714"></a>dent: but on the other side, where every ring is made broader by the further <a id="l1715"></a>unfolding its colours, it must interfere more with other rings than before, and <a id="l1716"></a>so become less distinct.</p>
<p id="par144">To explain this a little further; suppose the concentric circles, A B and <a id="l1717"></a>C D, represent the red and violet of any order, which, together with the in<a id="l1718"></a>termediate colours, constitute any one of these rings. Now, these being <a id="l1719"></a>viewed through a prism, the violet circle, B C, will, by a greater refraction, be <a id="l1720"></a>further translated from its place than the red, A D, and so approach nearer <a id="l1721"></a>to it on that side towards which the refractions are made. For instance, if <a id="l1722"></a>the red be translated to <em>a d</em>, the violet may be translated to <em>b c</em>, so as to ap<a id="l1723"></a>proach nearer to it at <em>c</em> than before; and, if the red be further translated to <a id="l1724"></a>a d, the violet may be so much further translated to b c, as to convene with <a id="l1725"></a>it at c, and, if the red be yet further translated to <span class="greek">α δ</span>, the violet may be still <a id="l1726"></a>so much further translated to <span class="greek">β γ</span>, as to pass beyond it at <span class="greek">γ</span>, and convene with it <a id="l1727"></a>at <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>. And this being understood, not only of the red and the violet, but of <a id="l1728"></a>all the intermediate colours; and also of every revolution of those co<a id="l1729"></a>lours, you will easily perceive, how these of the same revolution or order, by <a id="l1730"></a>their narrowness at <em>c d</em>, and <span class="greek">δ γ</span>, and their coincidence at <em>c d</em>, <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>, ought <a id="l1731"></a>to constitute pretty distinct arcs of circles, especially at <em>c d</em>, or at <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>, and <a id="l1732"></a>that they will appear several at <em>c d</em>, at c d exhibit whiteness by their coinci<a id="l1733"></a>dence, and again appear several at <span class="greek">δ γ</span>, but yet in a contrary order to that <a id="l1734"></a>which they had before, and still retain beyond <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>. But, on the other <a id="l1735"></a>side, at <em>a b</em>, a b, or <span class="greek">α β</span>, these colours must become much more confused by <a id="l1736"></a>being dilated, and spread so as to interfere with those of other orders. And <a id="l1737"></a>the same confusion will happen at <span class="greek">δ γ</span> between <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>, if the refraction be <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p293"> &lt;293&gt; </span>very great, or the prism very distant from the object-glasses; in which case no <a id="l1738"></a>parts of the ring will be seen, save only two little arcs at <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>, whose distance <a id="l1739"></a>from one another will be augmented by removing the prism still further from <a id="l1740"></a>the object-glasses. And these little arcs must be distinctest and whitest at their <a id="l1741"></a>middle; and at their ends, where they grow confused, they must be coloured; <a id="l1742"></a>and the colours at one end of every arc must be in a contrary order to those <a id="l1743"></a>at the other end, by reason that they cross in the intermediate white; namely, <a id="l1744"></a>their ends, which verge towards <span class="greek">δ γ</span>, will be red, and yellow on that side next <a id="l1745"></a>the center, and blue and violet on the other side. But their other ends, which <a id="l1746"></a>verge from <span class="greek">δ γ</span>, will, on the contrary, be blue and violet on that side towards <a id="l1747"></a>the center, and on the other side red and yellow.</p>
<p id="par145">For confirmation of all this, I need to alledge no more, than that it is mathe<a id="l1748"></a>matically demonstrable from my former principles. But I shall add, that they, <a id="l1749"></a>which please to take the prisms, may be the testimony of their senses be assured, <a id="l1750"></a>that these explications are not hypothetical, but infallibly true and genuine: <a id="l1751"></a>for in a dark room, by viewing these rings through a prism, by reflection of <a id="l1752"></a>the several prismatic colours, which an assistant causes to move to and fro <a id="l1753"></a>upon a wall or paper, from whence they are reflected, whilst the spectator's <a id="l1754"></a>eye, the prism, and object-glasses (as in the thirteenth observation) are placed <a id="l1755"></a>steddy, the position of the circles, made successively by the several colours, <a id="l1756"></a>will be found such, in respect of one another, as I have described at <em>a b c d</em>, or <a id="l1757"></a>a b c d, or <span class="greek">α β γ δ</span>. And by the same method the truth of the explications of <a id="l1758"></a>the other observations is to be examined.</p>
<p id="par146">By what hath been said, the like phænomena of water-bubbles and thin <a id="l1759"></a>plates of glass may be understood. But in small fragments of those plates, <a id="l1760"></a>there is this further observable, that, if they, lying flat upon a table, be turned <a id="l1761"></a>about their center, whilst they are viewed through a prism, some of them ex<a id="l1762"></a>hibit waves in one or two positions only; but the most of them do in all posi<a id="l1763"></a>tions exhibit those waves, and that for the most part appearing almost all over <a id="l1764"></a>the glass. The reason is, that the superficies of such plates are not even, but <a id="l1765"></a>have many cavities and swellings, which, how shallow soever, do a little vary <a id="l1766"></a>the thickness of the plate; and by the several sides of those cavities there <a id="l1767"></a>must be produced waves in several postures of the prism. Now, though it <a id="l1768"></a>be but some very small and narrow parts of the glass, by which these waves <a id="l1769"></a>for the most part are caused, yet they may seem to extend themselves over the <a id="l1770"></a>whole glass, because from the narrowest of those parts there are colours of several <a id="l1771"></a>orders confusedly reflected, which by refraction of the prism are unfolded, and <a id="l1772"></a>dispersed to several places, so as to constitute so many several waves as there <a id="l1773"></a>were divers orders of the colours promiscuously reflected from that part of the <a id="l1774"></a>glass.</p>
<p id="par147">These are the principal phænomena of thin plates or bubbles, whose expli<a id="l1775"></a>cations depend on the properties of light, that I have heretofore delivered: <a id="l1776"></a>and these, you see, do necessarily follow from them, and agree with them even <a id="l1777"></a>to their least circumstances; and not only so, but do very much tend to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p294"> &lt;294&gt; </span>their proof. Thus, by the twenty-fourth observation, it appears, that the <a id="l1778"></a>rays of several colours, made, as well by thin plates or bubbles, as by the re<a id="l1779"></a>fractions of a prism, have several degrees of refrangibility, whereby those of <a id="l1780"></a>each order, which, at their reflection from the plate or bubble, are intermixed <a id="l1781"></a>with those of other orders, are separated from them by refraction, and associ<a id="l1782"></a>ated together, so as to become visible by themselves, like arcs of circles. For, <a id="l1783"></a>if the rays were all alike refrangible, it is impossible, that the whiteness, which <a id="l1784"></a>to the naked sense appears uniform, should by refraction have its parts trans<a id="l1785"></a>posed, and ranged into those black and white arcs.</p>
<p id="par148">It appears also, that the unequal refractions of difform rays proceed not <a id="l1786"></a>from any contingent irregularities, such as are veins, an uneven polish, or for<a id="l1787"></a>tuitous position of the pores of glass, unequal motions in the air or æther, <a id="l1788"></a>spreading, breaking, or dividing the same ray into many diverging parts, or <a id="l1789"></a>the like. For, admitting any such irregularities, it would be impossible for <a id="l1790"></a>refractions to render those rings so very distinct and well defined, as they do <a id="l1791"></a>in the twenty-fourth observation. It is necessary therefore, that every ray have <a id="l1792"></a>its proper and constant degree of refrangibility connate with it; according to <a id="l1793"></a>which its refraction is ever justly and regularly performed, and that several <a id="l1794"></a>rays have several of those degrees.</p>
<p id="par149">And what is said of their refrangibility may be understood of their reflexi<a id="l1795"></a>bility; that is, of their dispositions to be reflected, some at a greater, and others <a id="l1796"></a>at a less thickness of thin plates or bubbles, namely, that those dispositions are <a id="l1797"></a>also connate with the rays, and immutable, as may appear by the thirteenth, <a id="l1798"></a>fourteenth, and fifteenth observations, compared with the fourth and eighteenth.</p>
<p id="par150">By the precedent observations it appears also, that the whiteness is a dissimilar <a id="l1799"></a>mixture of all colours, and that light is a mixture of rays endowed with all <a id="l1800"></a>those colours. For, considering the multitude of the rings of colours in the <a id="l1801"></a>third, twelfth, and twenty-fourth observations, it is manifest, that, although <a id="l1802"></a>in the fourth and eighteenth observations there appear more than eight or nine <a id="l1803"></a>of those rings, yet there are really a far greater number, which so much inter<a id="l1804"></a>fere and mingle with one another, as, after those eight or nine revolutions, to <a id="l1805"></a>dilute one another wholly, and constitute an even and sensible uniform white<a id="l1806"></a>ness. And consequently, that whiteness must be allowed a mixture of all co<a id="l1807"></a>lours, and the light, which conveys it to the eye, must be a mixture of rays <a id="l1808"></a>endued with all those colours.</p>
<p id="par151">But further, by the twenty-fourth observation it appears, that there is a con<a id="l1809"></a>stant relation between colours and refrangibility, the most refrangible rays being <a id="l1810"></a>violet, the least refrangible red, and those of intermediate colours having pro<a id="l1811"></a>portionally intermediate degrees of refrangibility. And, by the thirteenth, <a id="l1812"></a>fourteenth, and fifteenth observations, compared with the fourth or eighteenth, <a id="l1813"></a>there appears to be the same constant relation between colour and refrangi<a id="l1814"></a>bility; the violet being on equal terms reflected at least thickness of any thin <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p295"> &lt;295&gt; </span>plate or bubble; the red at greatest thickness, and the intermediate colours at <a id="l1815"></a>intermediate thicknesses: whence it follows, that the colorific dispositions of <a id="l1816"></a>rays are also connate with them, and immutable; and by consequence, that all <a id="l1817"></a>the productions and appearances of colours in the world are derived, not from <a id="l1818"></a>any physical change caused in light by refraction of reflection, but ony from <a id="l1819"></a>the various mixtures or separations of rays, by virtue of their different refran<a id="l1820"></a>gibility. And, in this respect it is, that the science of colours <a id="l1821"></a>becomes a speculation more proper for mathematicians than naturalists.</p>
</div>
<div><p id="par152">This being read, occasion was taken to discourse of Mr. NEWTON's theory <a id="l1822"></a>itself, and to debate, whether the rays of light, which, though alike incident in <a id="l1823"></a>the same medium, yet exhibit different colours, may not reasonably be said to <a id="l1824"></a>owe that exhibition of different colours to the several degrees of the velocity of <a id="l1825"></a>pulses, rather than, as Mr. NEWTON thought, to the several connate degrees of <a id="l1826"></a>refrangibility in the rays themselves?</p>
<p id="par153">Mr. HOOKE was of opinion, that the former of these ways was sufficient to give <a id="l1827"></a>a good account of the diversity of colours</p>

<p id="par154"><em>February</em> 10. Dr. MAPLETOFT was elected and admitted.</p>
<p id="par155">Capt. SHEERES, Mr. HALL, and Signor TRAVAGINO were elected.</p>
<p id="par156">Mr. BERCHENSHAW presented himself to the Society, and shewed them his <a id="l1828"></a>scale of music, wherein were contained,</p>
<p id="par157">1. A table of all consonant and dissonant intervals suitable to musical harmony, <a id="l1829"></a>which are practicable, and may be expressed by the voice and other instruments. <a id="l1830"></a>To these respective intervals apt and proper numbers were assigned, by which <a id="l1831"></a>their ratio's and proportions were demonstrated.</p>
<p id="par158">2. A system of all the keys, by which the aforesaid intervals were completed; <a id="l1832"></a>of which keys some were natural; some intended to the first degree of acute<a id="l1833"></a>ness; some remitted to the first degree of gravity; some twice spissated; some <a id="l1834"></a>twice asperated.</p>
<p id="par159">3. In this scale the magnitude, dimension, and proportion of the said keys <a id="l1835"></a>were exactly demonstrated according to the proportional parts of a chord, the <a id="l1836"></a>chord being supposed thirty-six inches long.</p>
<p id="par160">If it were demanded, whether there was any thing in this table and system, <a id="l1837"></a>that was not to be found in the scales and writings of other musicians? he <a id="l1838"></a>answered,</p>
<p id="par161">1. That the intervals in this table were perfect and complete. There was not <a id="l1839"></a>one too many, nor one wanting, which might conduce to the making of <a id="l1840"></a>harmony.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p296"> &lt;296&gt; </span>
<p id="par162">2. That the sounds or musical numbers contained in this system arose out of <a id="l1841"></a>the unison, and from one another, according to the reason of figurate, not <a id="l1842"></a>simple numbers, (as, he said, he could demonstrate by numbers assigned to the <a id="l1843"></a>respective intervals in the table) for that so the reason of the state of music <a id="l1844"></a>required.</p>
<p id="par163">3. That there are neither more or less keys in this system, than would com<a id="l1845"></a>plete the aforesaid intervals.</p>
<p id="par164">4. That in this scale all the tones are of the same ratio, and that so are all the <a id="l1846"></a>semitones, semiditones, ditones, and other intervals.</p>
<p id="par165">5. That the true magnitude and dimension of every one of the said keys are <a id="l1847"></a>demonstrated according to the proportional parts of a chord.</p>
<p id="par166">6. That the natural, genuine, and true reason of the excellency and fullness of <a id="l1848"></a>the harmony of three, four, frive, six, and seven parts, may clearly be discerned <a id="l1849"></a>by the system of seven parts.</p>
<p id="par167">He added, that many other things were to be found in this table and scale, of <a id="l1850"></a>which little or no mention is made in the scales and writings of either modern or <a id="l1851"></a>antient musical authors; which, he said, he intended to discover, and to write of <a id="l1852"></a>them at large, as he should be enabled thereunto.</p>
<p id="par168">He was exhorted to finish this work, or at least to publish this system with an <a id="l1853"></a>explanation thereof.</p>
<p id="par169">After this was read the last part of Mr. NEWTON'S <em>observations</em>, wherein he <a id="l1854"></a>considered in nine propositions, how the phænomena of thin transparent plates <a id="l1855"></a>stand related to those of all other natural bodies: of which bodies having before <a id="l1856"></a>mentioned, that they appear of divers colours, according as they are disposed <a id="l1857"></a>to reflect most copiously the rays indued with these colours, he now inquires <a id="l1858"></a>after their constitutions.</p>
<p id="par170">Here, among many other considerable things, he shews, how the bigness of <a id="l1859"></a>the component parts of natural bodies may be conjectured by their colours: as <a id="l1860"></a>also, that the cause of reflexion is not the impinging of light on the solid and <a id="l1861"></a>impervious parts of bodies, as was commonly supposed.</p>
<p id="par171">This last part was as follows:</p>
<div>
<p id="par172">I am now come to the last part of this design; which is, to consider, how <a id="l1862"></a>the phænomena of thin transparent plates stand related to those of all other na<a id="l1863"></a>tural bodies. Of these bodies I have already told you, that they appear of di<a id="l1864"></a>vers colours, according as they are disposed to reflect most copiously the rays <a id="l1865"></a>endued with those colours. But their constitutions, whereby they reflect some rays <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p297"> &lt;297&gt; </span>more copiously than others, remains to be inquired after. And this I shall en<a id="l1866"></a>deavour in the following propositions.</p>
<p id="par173">Prop. 1. Those superficies reflect the greatest quantity of light, which have <a id="l1867"></a>the greatest refracting power; that is, which interceeds mediums, that differ most <a id="l1868"></a>in their refracting densities; and in the confines of equally dense mediums there <a id="l1869"></a>is no reflection.</p>
<p id="par174">The analogy between reflection and refraction will appear by considering, that <a id="l1870"></a>when light passeth obliquely out of one medium into another, which refracts <a id="l1871"></a>from the perpendicular, the greater is the difference of their density, the less <a id="l1872"></a>obliquity is requisite to cause a total reflection; because as the sines are, which <a id="l1873"></a>measure the refraction, so is the sine of incidence, at which the total reflection <a id="l1874"></a>begins, to the radius of the circle; and consequently that incidence is least, <a id="l1875"></a>where there is the great difference of the sines. Thus in the passing of light out <a id="l1876"></a>of water into air, where the refraction is measured by the ratio of the sines, 3 to <a id="l1877"></a>4, the total reflection begins, when the angle of the incidence is about forty- <a id="l1878"></a>eight degrees and thirty-five minutes. In passing out of glass into air, where <a id="l1879"></a>the refraction is measured by the ratio of the sines 20 to 31, the total reflection <a id="l1880"></a>begins, when the angle of incidence is forty degress and ten minutes: and so, <a id="l1881"></a>in passing out of crystal, or more strongly refracting mediums, into air, there <a id="l1882"></a>is still a less obliquity requisite to cause a total reflection. Superficies therefore, <a id="l1883"></a>which refract most, do soonest reflect all the light, which is incident on them, <a id="l1884"></a>and so must be allowed most strongly reflective.</p>
<p id="par175">But the truth of this proposition will further appear, by observing, that in <a id="l1885"></a>the superficies, interceeding any two of those mediums, air or water, or other <a id="l1886"></a>liquors, common glass, crystal, and metalline glasses, the reflection is stronger <a id="l1887"></a>or weaker accordingly as the superficies hath a greater or less refracting power. <a id="l1888"></a>Thus, when other mediums are contiguous to air, the reflection is stronger <a id="l1889"></a>in the superficies of glass than of water, still stronger in the superficies of crys<a id="l1890"></a>tal, and strongest in the superficies of metalline glass. So, in the confine of <a id="l1891"></a>water and common glass, the reflection is very weak, but yet stronger than in <a id="l1892"></a>the confine of water and oil, or almost any two liquors, and still stronger <a id="l1893"></a>in the confine of water and crystal, or metalline glass: accordingly as those <a id="l1894"></a>mediums differ more or less in density, so in the confine of common glass and <a id="l1895"></a>crystal there is a weak reflection, and a stronger relection in the confine of <a id="l1896"></a>common and metalline glass: but in the confine of two glasses of equal den<a id="l1897"></a>sity, there is not any sensible reflection, as was shewn in the first observation. <a id="l1898"></a>And the same may be understood of the superficies of two crystals or liquors, <a id="l1899"></a>or any other substances, in which no refraction is caused: whence it comes to <a id="l1900"></a>pass, that uniform mediums have no sensible reflexion but in their external su<a id="l1901"></a>perficies, where they are adjacent to their mediums of a different density.</p>
<p id="par176">Prop. 2. The least parts of natural bodies are in some measure transparent; <a id="l1902"></a>and the opacities of those bodies arise from the multitude of reflections caused <a id="l1903"></a>in their internal parts.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p298"> &lt;298&gt; </span>
<p id="par177">That this is so, will easily be granted by them, that have been conversant with <a id="l1904"></a>microscopes: and it may also be tried by applying any substance to a hole, through <a id="l1905"></a>which the light is emitted into a dark room; for how opake soever that sub<a id="l1906"></a>stance may seem in the open air, it will, by that means, appear very manifestly <a id="l1907"></a>transparent, if it be of a sufficient thickness: only metalline bodies must be ex<a id="l1908"></a>empted, which, by reason of their excessive density seem to reflect almost all the <a id="l1909"></a>light incident on their first superficies.</p>
<p id="par178">Prop. 3. Between the parts of opake or coloured bodies are many interstices, <a id="l1910"></a>replenished with mediums of other densities, as water between the tinging cor<a id="l1911"></a>puscles, wherewith any liquor is impregnated; air between the aqueous globules <a id="l1912"></a>that constitute clouds or mists; and for the most part spaces void of both air <a id="l1913"></a>and water; but yet perhaps replenished with some subtiler medium between <a id="l1914"></a>the parts of hard bodies.</p>
<p id="par179">The truth of this is evinced by the two precedent propositions: for by the <a id="l1915"></a>second proposition there are many reflections from the internal part of bodies, <a id="l1916"></a>which by the first proposition would not happen, if the parts of those bodies <a id="l1917"></a>were continued without any such interstices between them, because reflections <a id="l1918"></a>are caused only in superficies, which interceed mediums of a different density.</p>
<p id="par180">But further, that this discontinuity of parts is the principal cause of the opa<a id="l1919"></a>city of bodies, will appear by considering, that opake substances become trans<a id="l1920"></a>parent by filling their pores with any substance of equal, or almost equal density <a id="l1921"></a>with their parts. Thus paper dipped in water or oil, the oculus mundi stone <a id="l1922"></a>steeped in water, linen-cloth oiled or varnished, and many other substances soaked <a id="l1923"></a>in such liquors, as will intimately pervade their little pores, become by that <a id="l1924"></a>means more transparent than otherwise. So, on the contrary, the most trans<a id="l1925"></a>parent substances may, by separating their parts, be rendered sufficiently opake; <a id="l1926"></a>as glass, by being reduced to powder, or otherwise flawed, water by being form<a id="l1927"></a>ed into many small bubbles, either alone in the form of froth, or by shaking <a id="l1928"></a>it together with oil of turpentine, or some other convenient liquor, with which <a id="l1929"></a>it will not incorporate, and horn by being scraped.</p>
<p id="par181">To the increase of the opacity of these bodies it conduces something, that by <a id="l1930"></a>the twenty third observation, the refractions of very thin transparent substances <a id="l1931"></a>are considerably stronger than those made by the same substances of a greater <a id="l1932"></a>thickness. And to the reflection of solid bodies it may be further added, that <a id="l1933"></a>the interstices of their parts are void of air. For that for the most part they <a id="l1934"></a>are so, it is reasonable to believe, considering the ineptitude, which air hath to <a id="l1935"></a>pervade small cavities, as appears by the ascension of water in slender glass-<a id="l1936"></a>pipes, paper, cloth, and other such like substances, whose pores are found too <a id="l1937"></a>small to be replenished with air, and yet large enough to admit water; and by <a id="l1938"></a>the difficulty, wherewith air pervades the pores of a bladder, through which <a id="l1939"></a>water find ready passage. And according to the eleventh observation, the ca<a id="l1940"></a>vities thus void of air will cause the same kind of effects as to reflection, which <a id="l1941"></a>those do, that are replenished with it; but yet something more manifestly, be<a id="l1942"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p299"> &lt;299&gt; </span>cause the medium in relation to refractions is rarest, when most empty of air <a id="l1943"></a>as Mr. HOOKE hath proved in his Micrographia; in which book he hath also <a id="l1944"></a>largely discoursed of this and the precedent proposition, and delivered many <a id="l1945"></a>other very excellent things concerning the colours of thin plates, and other na<a id="l1946"></a>tural bodies, which I have not scrupled to make use of so far as they were for <a id="l1947"></a>my purpose.</p>
<p id="par182">Prop. 4. The parts of bodies and their interstices must not be less than <a id="l1948"></a>of some definitive bigness, to render them opake and coloured; for the opakest <a id="l1949"></a>bodies, if their parts be subtilly divided (as metals by being dissolved in acid <a id="l1950"></a>menstruums, &amp;c.) become prefectly transparent. And you may also remem<a id="l1951"></a>ber, that in the eighth observation there was no reflection at the superficies of <a id="l1952"></a>the object-glasses, where they were very near one another, though they did not <a id="l1953"></a>absolutely touch. And in the seventeenth observation, the reflection of the <a id="l1954"></a>water-bubble, where it became thinnest, was almost insensible, so as to cause the <a id="l1955"></a>apparitions of very black spots.</p>
<p id="par183">On these grounds I conceive it is, that water, salt, glass, stones, and such <a id="l1956"></a>like substances, are transparent; for, upon divers considerations, they seem to <a id="l1957"></a>be as porous as other bodies, but yet their pores and parts too small to cause <a id="l1958"></a>any opacity.</p>
<p id="par184">Prop. 5. The transparent parts of bodies, according to their several sizes, <a id="l1959"></a>must <em>reflect</em> rays of one colour, and <em>transmit</em> those of another, on the same <a id="l1960"></a>grounds, that thin plates or bubbles do reflect or transmit those rays: and this <a id="l1961"></a>I take to be the ground of all their colours.</p>
<p id="par185">For, if a thinned or plated body, which being of an even thickness appears <a id="l1962"></a>all over of one uniform colour, should be broken into fragments of the same <a id="l1963"></a>thickness with the plate, I see no reason, why a heap of those fragments should <a id="l1964"></a>not constitute a powder of the same colour, which the plate exhibited before it <a id="l1965"></a>was broken. And the parts of all natural bodies, being like so many fragments <a id="l1966"></a>of a plate, must on the same grounds exhibit the same colours.</p>
<p id="par186">Now, that they do so, will further appear by the affinity of their proper<a id="l1967"></a>ties: as that the infusion of nephritic-wood, and many other substances reflect <a id="l1968"></a>one colour, and transmit another, like thin bodies in the ninth and twentieth <a id="l1969"></a>observations. That the colours of silks, cloaths, and other substances, which <a id="l1970"></a>water or oil can intimately penetrate, become more faint and obscure by being <a id="l1971"></a>emerged in those liquors, and recover their vigour again by being dried, much <a id="l1972"></a>after the manner declared of thin bodies, in the tenth and twenty first obser<a id="l1973"></a>vations: and that some of those coloured powders, which painters use, may have <a id="l1974"></a>their colours a little changed, by being very elaborately and finely ground. <a id="l1975"></a>Where I see not, what can be justly pretended for those changes, besides the <a id="l1976"></a>breaking of their parts into less parts by that contrition, after the same manner <a id="l1977"></a>that the colour of a plate is changed by varying its thickness. For which rea<a id="l1978"></a>son also it is, that many flowers, by being bruised, become more transparent <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p300"> &lt;300&gt; </span>than before, or, at least in some degree or other, change their colours. Nor <a id="l1979"></a>is it much less to my purpose, that, by mixing divers liquors, very odd and <a id="l1980"></a>remarkable productions and changes of colours may be effected, of which no <a id="l1981"></a>cause can be more obvious and natural, than that the saline corpuscles of one <a id="l1982"></a>liquor do variously act upon, or unite with, the tinging corpuscles of another; <a id="l1983"></a>so as to make them swell or shrink (whereby not only their bulk, but their <a id="l1984"></a>density also may be changed) or to divide them into smaller corpuscles, or make <a id="l1985"></a>many of them associate into one cluster; for we see how apt those saline men<a id="l1986"></a>struums are to penetrate and dissolve substances, to which they are applied; and <a id="l1987"></a>some of them to precipitate what others dissolve. In like manner, if we con<a id="l1988"></a>sider the various phænomena of the atmosphere, we may observe, that when <a id="l1989"></a>vapours are first raised, they hinder not the transparency of the air, being di<a id="l1990"></a>vided into parts too small to cause any reflection in their superficies: but when, <a id="l1991"></a>in order to compose drops of rain, they began to coalesce and constitute glo<a id="l1992"></a>bules of all intermediate sizes, those globules, when they become of a conveni<a id="l1993"></a>ent size to reflect some colours, and transmit others, may constitute clouds of <a id="l1994"></a>various colours, according to their sizes. And I see not what can be rationally <a id="l1995"></a>conceived, in so transparent a substance as water for the production of these <a id="l1996"></a>colours, besides the various sizes of its parcels, which seem to affect a globular <a id="l1997"></a>figure most; but yet perhaps not without some instability in the smallest of <a id="l1998"></a>them, by reason that those are most easily agitated by heat or any trembling mo<a id="l1999"></a>tions in the air.</p>
<p id="par187">Prop. 6. The parts of bodies, on which their colours depend, are denser than <a id="l2000"></a>the medium, which pervades their interstices.</p>
<p id="par188">This will appear by considering, that the colour of a body depends not only <a id="l2001"></a>on the rays, which are incident perpendicularly or its parts, but on those also, <a id="l2002"></a>which are incident at all other angles. And that, according to the seventh <a id="l2003"></a>observation, a very little variation of obliquity will change the reflected colour, <a id="l2004"></a>where the thin body or small particle is rarer than the ambient medium, in <a id="l2005"></a>somuch that such a small particle will, at diversly oblique incidents, reflect all <a id="l2006"></a>sorts of colours, in so great a variety, that the colour, resulting from them all <a id="l2007"></a>confusedly reflected from a heap of such particles, must rather be a white or <a id="l2008"></a>grey, than any other colour, or at best it must be but a very imperfect and <a id="l2009"></a>dirty colour; whereas, if the thin body or small particle be much denser than <a id="l2010"></a>the ambient medium, the colours, according to the nineteenth observation, are <a id="l2011"></a>so little changed by the variation of obliquity, that the rays, which are re<a id="l2012"></a>flected least obliquely, may predominate over the rest so much, as to cause a <a id="l2013"></a>heap of such particles to appear very intensly of their colour.</p>
<p id="par189">It concludes also something to this proposition, that, according to the twenty-<a id="l2014"></a>second observation, the colours exhibited by the denser thin body within the <a id="l2015"></a>rarer are more brisk than those exhibited by the rarer within the denser.</p>
<p id="par190">Prop. 7. The bigness of the component parts of natural bodies may be <a id="l2016"></a>conjectured by their colours.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p301"> &lt;301&gt; </span>
<p id="par191">For since the parts of these bodies, by proposition 5. do most probably ex<a id="l2017"></a>hibit the same colours with a plate of equal thickness, provided they have the <a id="l2018"></a>same refractive density; and since their parts seem for the most part to have <a id="l2019"></a>much the same density with water or glass, as by many circumstances is obvious <a id="l2020"></a>to collect: to determine the sizes of these parts, you need only have recourse <a id="l2021"></a>to the precedent tables, in which the thickness of water or glass exhibiting any <a id="l2022"></a>colour is expressed. Thus, if it be desired to know the diameter of a cor<a id="l2023"></a>puscle, which being of equal density with glass, shall reflect green of the third <a id="l2024"></a>order; the number 17<span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-45-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-221" style="width: 0.712em;

<p id="par192">The greatest difficulty is here to know, of what order the colour of any <a id="l2025"></a>body is; and for this end we muct have recourse to the fourth and eighteenth <a id="l2026"></a>observations, from whence may be collected these particulars.</p>
<p id="par193"><em>Scarlets</em>, and other <em>reds, oranges</em> and <em>yellows</em>, if they be pure and intense, are <a id="l2027"></a>most probably of the second order. Those of the first and third order also may <a id="l2028"></a>be pretty good; only the orange and red of the third order have too great a <a id="l2029"></a>mixture of violet and blue.</p>
<p id="par194">There may be good <em>greens</em> of the fourth order, but the purest are of the third: <a id="l2030"></a>and of this order the green of all vegetables seems to be, partly by reason of <a id="l2031"></a>the intenseness of their colours, and partly because when they wither, some of <a id="l2032"></a>them turn to a greenish yellow, and others to a more perfect yellow or orange, <a id="l2033"></a>or perhaps to red; passing first through all the aforesaid intermediate colours, <a id="l2034"></a>which changes seem to be effected by the exhaling of the moisture, which may <a id="l2035"></a>leave the tinging corpuscles more dense, and something augmented by the ac<a id="l2036"></a>cretion of the oily and earthy part of that moisture. Now the green, without <a id="l2037"></a>doubt, is of the same order with those colours, into which it changeth, because <a id="l2038"></a>the changes are gradual, and those colours, though usually not very pure, yet <a id="l2039"></a>for the most part are too pure and lively to be of the fourth order.</p>
<p id="par195"><em>Blues</em> and <em>purples</em> may be either of the second or third order; but the best are <a id="l2040"></a>of the third. Thus the colour of <em>violet</em> seems to be of that order; because <a id="l2041"></a>their syrup, by acid liquors, turns red, and by urinous and alkalazite turns <a id="l2042"></a>green. For since it is of the nature of acids to dissolve or attenuate, and of <a id="l2043"></a>alcalis to precipitate or incrassate, if the purple colour of the syrup was of <a id="l2044"></a>the second order, an acid liquor by attenuating its tinging corpuscles would tinge <a id="l2045"></a>it to a red of the first order, and an alcali, by incrassating them, would change <a id="l2046"></a>it to a green of the second order; which red and green, especially the green, <a id="l2047"></a>seem too imperfect to be the colours produced by these changes. But if the <a id="l2048"></a>said purple be supposed of the third order, its change to red of the second <a id="l2049"></a>and green of the third may, without any inconvenience, be allowed.</p>
<p id="par196">If there be found any body of a deeper and less reddish purple than that of <a id="l2050"></a>violets, its colour most probably is of the second order. But yet there being <a id="l2051"></a>no body commonly known, whose colour is constantly more deep than theirs, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p302"> &lt;302&gt; </span>I have made use of their name to denote the deepest and least reddish purples, <a id="l2052"></a>such as manifestly transcend their colour in purity.</p>
<p id="par197">The <em>blue</em> of the first order, though very faint and little, may possibly be the <a id="l2053"></a>colour of some substances; and particularly the azure colour of the skies <a id="l2054"></a>seems to be of this order. For all vapours, when they begin to condense and <a id="l2055"></a>coalesce into small parcels, become first of that bigness, whereby such an azure <a id="l2056"></a>must be reflected, before they can constitute clouds of other colours. And so <a id="l2057"></a>this being the first colour, which vapours begin to reflect, it ought to be the <a id="l2058"></a>colour of the finest and most transparent skies, in which vapours are not ar<a id="l2059"></a>rived to that grossness requisite to reflect other colours, as we find it is by ex<a id="l2060"></a>perience.</p>
<p id="par198">Whiteness, if it be intense, is either that in the first order of colours, of <a id="l2061"></a>which sort perhaps is the colour of white lead; or else it is a mixture of <a id="l2062"></a>those succeeding the third or fourth order, such as is the colour of paper, <a id="l2063"></a>linen, and most white substances. If corpuscles of various sizes, exhibiting the <a id="l2064"></a>colours of the second and third order, be mixed, they should rather constitute <a id="l2065"></a>an imperfect whiteness or grey, of which I have already spoken: but yet it seems <a id="l2066"></a>not impossible for them to exhibit an intense whiteness, if they be disposed to <a id="l2067"></a>transmit all the light, which they reflect not, and do not retain and stifle much <a id="l2068"></a>of it. For thus I told you, that froth at a distance hath appeared very white, <a id="l2069"></a>and yet, near at hand, the several bubbles, of which it was constituted, were <a id="l2070"></a>seen tinged all over with rings of colours of the four or five first orders.</p>
<p id="par199">Lastly, for the production of <em>black</em>, the corpuscles must be less than any of <a id="l2071"></a>those, which exhibit colours. For at all greater sizes there is too much light re<a id="l2072"></a>flected to constitute this colour. But if they be supposed a little less than is re<a id="l2073"></a>quisite to reflect the blue of the first order, they will, according to the fourth, <a id="l2074"></a>eighth, seventeenth, and eighteenth observations, reflect so very little light as <a id="l2075"></a>to appear intensely black, and yet may perhaps variously refract it to and fro <a id="l2076"></a>within themselves so long, until it happen to be stifled and lost; by which <a id="l2077"></a>means they will appear black in all positions of the eye without any transpa<a id="l2078"></a>rency. And from hence may be understood, why fire, and the more subtil <a id="l2079"></a>dissolver, putrefaction, turn substances to black; why small quantities of black <a id="l2080"></a>substances impart their colour very freely and intensely to other substances, to <a id="l2081"></a>which they are applied; why glass ground very elaborately, on a copper-plate, <a id="l2082"></a>till it be well polished, makes the sand, together with what is worn off from <a id="l2083"></a>the glass, and copper, become very black; why black substances do soonest of <a id="l2084"></a>all others become hot and burn, which effect may proceed, partly from the <a id="l2085"></a>multitude of refractions in a little room, and partly from the easy commo<a id="l2086"></a>tion of so very small corpuscles; and why blacks are usually a little inclined to <a id="l2087"></a>a bluish colour. For that they are so, may be seen by illuminating white <a id="l2088"></a>paper by reflection from black substances, which will usually appear of a bluish <a id="l2089"></a>white. And the reason is, that black borders on the obscure blue of the first <a id="l2090"></a>order, described in the eighteenth observation, whence the corpuscles of black <a id="l2091"></a>substances are most apt to reflect that colour.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p303"> &lt;303&gt; </span>
<p id="par200">In these descriptions I have been the more particular, because it is not impos<a id="l2092"></a>sible, but that microscopes may at length be improved to the discovery of <a id="l2093"></a>corpuscles of bodies, on which their colours depend. For if those instruments <a id="l2094"></a>could be so far improved, as with sufficient distinctness to represent objects five <a id="l2095"></a>or six hundred times bigger than at a foot distance they appear to our naked eyes. <a id="l2096"></a>I should hope, that we might be able to discover some of the greatest of those <a id="l2097"></a>corpuscles. And by one, that would magnify three or four thousand times, per<a id="l2098"></a>haps they might all be discovered but those, which produce blackness. In the <a id="l2099"></a>mean while, I see nothing material, that rationally can be doubted of, except<a id="l2100"></a>ing this position, that transparent corpuscles of the same thickness and density <a id="l2101"></a>with a plate do exhibit the same colour. And this I would have understood <a id="l2102"></a>not without some latitude, as well because those corpuscles may be of irregular <a id="l2103"></a>figures, and many rays must be obliquely incident, and so have a shorter way <a id="l2104"></a>through them than the length of their diameter; as because the straitness of <a id="l2105"></a>the medium, pent in on all sides, may a little alter its motions, or other qua<a id="l2106"></a>lities, on which the reflexion depends. But yet I cannot much suspect the last, <a id="l2107"></a>because I have observed of some small plates of Muscovy-glass, which were of <a id="l2108"></a>an even thickness, that through a microscope they have appeared of the same <a id="l2109"></a>colour at their edges and corners, where the included medium was terminated, <a id="l2110"></a>which they appeared of in other places. However, it would add much to our <a id="l2111"></a>satisfaction, if those corpuscles could be discovered with microscopes, which if <a id="l2112"></a>we shall ever attain to, I fear it will be the utmost improvement of this sense; <a id="l2113"></a>for it seems impossible to see the more secret and noble works of nature within <a id="l2114"></a>those corpuscles, by reason of their transparency.</p>
<p id="par201">This may suffice concerning the constitution of natural bodies, on which their <a id="l2115"></a>colours depend. But for further understanding the nature of reflections, I <a id="l2116"></a>shall add these two following propositions.</p>
<p id="par202">Prop. 8. The cause of the reflection is not the impinging of light on the <a id="l2117"></a>solid and impervious parts of bodies, as is commonly supposed.</p>
<p id="par203">This will appear by the following considerations: first, that in the passage of <a id="l2118"></a>light out of glass into air, there is a reflection as strong or stronger than in its <a id="l2119"></a>passage out of air into glass, and by many degrees stronger than in its passage <a id="l2120"></a>out of glass into water. And it seems not probable, that air should have more <a id="l2121"></a>reflecting parts than water or glass. But if that should possibly be supposed, it <a id="l2122"></a>will avail nothing; for the reflection is as strong, if not stronger, when the air <a id="l2123"></a>is drawn away from the glass (suppose in the air-pump invented by Mr. BOYLE) <a id="l2124"></a>as when it is adjacent to it. Secondly, if light in its passage out of glass into <a id="l2125"></a>air be incident more obliquely than at an angle of forty or forty-one degrees, <a id="l2126"></a>it is wholly <em>reflected</em>; if less obliquely, it is in great measure <em>transmitted</em>. Now <a id="l2127"></a>it is not to be imagined, that light at one degree of obliquity should meet with <a id="l2128"></a>pores enough in the air to transmit the greater part of it, and at another degree <a id="l2129"></a>of obliquity meet with nothing but parts to reflect it wholly; especially consi<a id="l2130"></a>dering, that in its passage out of air into glass, how oblique soever be its <a id="l2131"></a>incidence, it finds pores enough in the glass to transmit the greatest part of it. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p304"> &lt;304&gt; </span>If any man suppose, that it is not reflected by the air, but by the utmost su<a id="l2132"></a>perficial parts of the glass, there is still the same difficulty; besides, that such <a id="l2133"></a>a supposition is unintelligible; and will also appear to be false, by applying wa<a id="l2134"></a>ter behind some part of the glass instead of air. For so in a convenient obli<a id="l2135"></a>quity of the rays, suppose of forty-five or forty-six degrees, at which they are <a id="l2136"></a>all <em>reflected</em>, where the air is adjacent to the glass, they shall be in great measure <a id="l2137"></a><em>transmitted</em>, where the water is adjacent to it; which argues, that their reflection <a id="l2138"></a>or transmission depends on the consitution of the air and water behind the <a id="l2139"></a>glass, and not on the parts of the glass.</p>
<p id="par204">Thirdly, if the colours made by a prism, placed at the entrance of a beam <a id="l2140"></a>of light into a darkened room, be successively cast on a second prism placed <a id="l2141"></a>at a great distance from the former, in such manner that they are all alike in<a id="l2142"></a>cident upon it; the second prism may be so inclined to the incident rays, that <a id="l2143"></a>those, which are of a blue colour, shall be all reflected by it; and yet those of a <a id="l2144"></a>red colour pretty copiously transmitted. Now if the reflection be caused by <a id="l2145"></a>the parts of air or glass, I would ask, why at the same obliquity of incidence <a id="l2146"></a>the blue should wholly impinge on those parts so as to be all reflected, and yet <a id="l2147"></a>the red find pores enough to be in great measure transmitted. Fourthly, <a id="l2148"></a>where two glasses touch one another, there is no sensible reflection, as was de<a id="l2149"></a>clared in the first observation; and yet I see no reason, why the rays should not <a id="l2150"></a>impinge on the parts of glass, when contiguous to another glass, as much as <a id="l2151"></a>when contiguous to air. Fifthly, when the top of a water-bubble (in the se<a id="l2152"></a>venteenth observation) by the continual subsiding and exhaling of the water <a id="l2153"></a>grew very thin, there was such a little and almost insensible quantity of light <a id="l2154"></a>reflected from it, that it appeared intensely black; whereas, round about that <a id="l2155"></a>black spot, where the water was thicker, the reflection was so strong as to make <a id="l2156"></a>the water seem very white. Nor is it only at the least thickness of thin plates <a id="l2157"></a>or bubbles that there is no manifest reflection, but at many other thicknesses <a id="l2158"></a>continually greater and greater. For in the fifteenth observation, the rays of the <a id="l2159"></a>same colour were by turns transmitted at one thickness, and reflected at another <a id="l2160"></a>thickness, for an intermediate number of successions. And yet in the superficies of the third body, where it is of any one thickness, there are as many <a id="l2162"></a>parts for the rays to impinge on, as where it is of any other thickness.</p>
<p id="par205">Lastly, if reflection were caused by the parts of reflecting bodies, it would <a id="l2163"></a>be impossible for thin plates or bubbles, at the same place to reflect the rays of <a id="l2164"></a>one colour, and transmit those of another, as they do according to the thirteenth <a id="l2165"></a>and fifteenth observations. For it is not to be imagined, that at one place the <a id="l2166"></a>rays, which, for instance, exhibit a blue colour, should have the fortune to dash <a id="l2167"></a>upon the <em>parts</em>, and those, which exhibit a red, to hit upon the pores of the <a id="l2168"></a>body; and then at another place, where the body is either a little thicker, or a <a id="l2169"></a>little thinner, that on the contrary the blue should hit upon its <em>pores</em>, and the <a id="l2170"></a><em>red</em> upon its <em>parts</em>.</p>
<p id="par206">Prop. 9. It is most probable, that the rays, which impinge on the solid <a id="l2171"></a>parts of any body, are not reflected but stifled and lost in that body.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p305"> &lt;305&gt; </span>
<p id="par207">This is consentaneous to the precedent proposition, and will further appear <a id="l2172"></a>by considering, that if all the rays should be reflected, which impinge on the in<a id="l2173"></a>ternal parts of clear water or crystal, those substances should rather have a cloudy <a id="l2174"></a>than so very clear transparency.</p>
<p id="par208">And further, there would be no principle of the obscurity or blackness, which <a id="l2175"></a>some bodies have in all positions of the eye. For to produce this effect, it is ne<a id="l2176"></a>cessary, that many rays be retained and lost in the body, and it seems not pro<a id="l2177"></a>bable, that any rays can be stopped and retained in it, which do not impinge on <a id="l2178"></a>its parts.</p>
