<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Chap. VI. <a id="l1"></a><br>Of the Empire of the Latines. <sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup></h2>
<p id="par1">The Romans were at first a small kingdom of Italy &amp; began <a id="l3"></a>to make a figure in the world about the time that in conjunction <a id="l4"></a>with the king of Pergamus they took from Antiochus magnus all Asia <a id="l5"></a>on this side the mountain Taurus, &amp; to grow great from the <a id="l6"></a>time that they conquered Macedon. For after the conquest <a id="l7"></a>of Greece they conquered Carthage &amp; gradually extended <a id="l8"></a>their dominion over Asia, Spain, Syria, Gallia, Egypt &amp; <a id="l9"></a>Dacia &amp; reigned over all these countries untill the revolt <a id="l10"></a>of Dacia &amp; the separation of the Empire of the Greeks <a id="l11"></a>from that of the Latines: the particular history of all which <a id="l12"></a>is every where to be met with.</p>
<p id="par2">Dacia revolted in or a little before the reign of Decius <a id="l13"></a>&amp; created great vexations to the Roman Empire. But the <a id="l14"></a>Church of Dacia still continued united to the Church of the Roman <a id="l15"></a>Empire: For Theophilus Bishop or Patriarch of Dacia was at <a id="l16"></a>the Council of Nice A.C. 325 &amp; his successor Vlphilas was <a id="l17"></a>at the Council of Constantinople A.C. 360.</p>
<p id="par3">Constantine the great built Constantinople A.C. 330 <a id="l18"></a>&amp; made it the metropolis of the eastern provinces of the <a id="l19"></a>Empire &amp; Rome of the western, both cities being governed after <a id="l20"></a>the same manner by a Senate &amp; Consuls. He left the Empire <a id="l21"></a>between his sons A.C. 337, &amp; his son Constantius reunited it A.C. <a id="l22"></a>353, &amp; Valentinian divided it between himself &amp; his brother <a id="l23"></a>Valens A.C. 364. And after the death of Valens it was reunited <a id="l24"></a>under Gratian the son of Valentinian A.C. 378, but after five <a id="l25"></a>months Gratian made Theodosius emperor of the east in the <a id="l26"></a>room of Valens 16 Ian. A.C.  379, &amp; Theodosius left the Empire <a id="l27"></a>divided between his sons Arcadius &amp; Honorius A.C. 395, after <a id="l28"></a>which it was no more united.</p>
<p id="par4">The two Empires into which the Roman Empire became <a id="l29"></a>now divided were distinguished by the names of the eastern <a id="l30"></a>&amp; western or Greek &amp; Latine Empires. And the Greek <a id="l31"></a>Empire continued intire about 240 years &amp; then lost <a id="l32"></a>Syria &amp; Egypt to the Saracens, but yet stood above 800 <a id="l33"></a>years longer before the Turks overthrew it. The Latin <a id="l34"></a>Empire stood intire about 12 or 13 years, &amp; then being invaded <a id="l35"></a>by the nations of Dacia, broke at once into ten kingdoms, the <a id="l36"></a>rise of which not being distinctly described by any historian, <a id="l37"></a>I shall here set down. But first it will be convenient to <a id="l38"></a>give you some account of the nations of Dacia by whom this <a id="l39"></a>Empire became divided.</p>
<p id="par5">Dacia was a large country bounded on the south by the <a id="l40"></a>Danube on the east by the Euxine sea,  on the north by the river Neister &amp; the mountain <a id="l42"></a>Crapac &amp; on the west by the river Tibesis or Teys which <a id="l43"></a>runs southward into the Danube a little  above Belgrade. It <a id="l44"></a>comprehended the countries now called Transylvania Moldavia <a id="l45"></a>&amp; Wallachia &amp; the eastern part of  uper Hungary. Its ancient inhabitants were called Getæ by the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> Greeks &amp; Daci by the Latines &amp;  Goths by themselves. Alexander <a id="l46"></a>the great attact them, &amp; Trajan conquered them &amp; reduced their <a id="l47"></a>country into a province of the Roman Empire: &amp; thereby the <a id="l48"></a>propagation of the Christian religion amongst them was much pro<a id="l49"></a>moted. And when they revolted, their kings by successive conquests <a id="l50"></a>grew into a large &amp; potent Empire composed of many northern <a id="l51"></a>nations. Ostrogotha reigned in the days of Philip &amp; Decius &amp; conquered the Gepides, Geberic the Vandals, &amp; <a id="l52"></a>Hermaneric the Heruli, placed by Iornandes upon the Palus Mæotis &amp; the Veneti, Antes &amp; Sclavi &amp; many other war<a id="l53"></a>like nations of Scythia &amp; Germany, as Iornandes informs us, <a id="l54"></a>&amp; particularly the nations which Iornandes calls the Thuidi, <a id="l55"></a>Vasinambrócæ, Mæreus, Mordensimnis, Caris, Rocæ, Tadzans, <a id="l56"></a>Athual, Navigo, Bubegentæ &amp; Coldæ &amp; the Æstti or Estij <a id="l57"></a>seated upon a long tract of the German Ocean or Baltick <a id="l58"></a>sea in Livonia. So that the kingdom seems at this time <a id="l59"></a>to have comprehended Volkinia, Red Russia, Poland, Lithuania <a id="l60"></a>Lifland Coerland Russia &amp; other Scythian nations between the Vistula or Weysel &amp; <a id="l61"></a>the Boristhenes or Niper as far northwards as Revel &amp; <a id="l62"></a>Narva  &amp; the Sinus Finicus, besides some nations of Germany <a id="l63"></a>&amp; Russia, suppose in Hungary on the north of the Danube in the Russian Verain &amp; in Novogorod. And from these conquests, saith Iornandes, some have compared <a id="l64"></a>this King to Alexander the great.</p>
<p id="par6">Among the conquered nations I reccon the Burgiones <a id="l65"></a>&amp; Phregundiones whom Ptolomy places between the Vistula &amp; Boristhenes &amp; whom <a id="l66"></a>(or some part of them) I take to be the Burgundians who had <a id="l67"></a>war with Fastida king of the Gepides a little before the reign <a id="l68"></a>of the Emperor Decius &amp; who in the reign of Valentinian fled <a id="l69"></a>from their seats to the side of the Rhene. For these Burgun<a id="l70"></a>dians are usually recconed a Gothic nation.</p>
<p id="par7"><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup>Hermaneric reigned long &amp; died in the fift year of <a id="l71"></a>the Emperors Valentinian &amp; Valens A.C. 368 or soon after being 110 <a id="l72"></a>years old, &amp; at his death or soon after, his kingdom <a id="l73"></a>became divided amongst many successors, Hunnimund, <a id="l74"></a>Vithimar, Athanaric, Fridigern, Box, &amp; perhaps some others. <a id="l75"></a>Hunnimund was his son &amp; reigned over the eastern part of <a id="l76"></a>the Goths called Ostrogoths. Vithimar or Winitharius was <a id="l77"></a>the son of Valeravan &amp; grandson of Athaulphus or Vuldulph <a id="l78"></a>the brother of Hermaneric &amp; reigned over a  part of <a id="l79"></a>the Goths called Gruthungi by A. Marcelline  Gothunni by <a id="l80"></a>Claudian, &amp; Sarmatæ &amp; Scythians by others. They were seated <span class="ns"></span><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> between Dacia &amp; the Alans.. Athanarick reigned <a id="l81"></a>over another called Visigoths from their scituation, &amp; Box over <a id="l82"></a>the Antes, &amp; the Gepides had also their King. These kings seem <a id="l83"></a>to have been rectors of Provinces in the life time of Hermaneric &amp; to have kept their governments after his <a id="l84"></a>death <a id="l85"></a><span class="ns"></span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 1v &gt; </span> <span class="ns"></span> Procopius tells us  in his first book of the Vandalick war <a id="l86"></a>that amongst the Gothic nations, which were many, the greatest &amp; most noble were the Goths [or Ostrogoths] the Vandals, the Visigoths <a id="l87"></a>&amp; the Gepides, &amp; that they differed only in name being white tall <a id="l88"></a>&amp; handsome which yellow hair, using the same language &amp; the same laws &amp; being of the same religion, the religion called <a id="l89"></a>Arian by the Romans. They all lived in Dæcia beyond the Danube <a id="l90"></a>untill they invaded the Empire &amp; no doubt they had their <a id="l91"></a>common language laws &amp; religion from being subjects of one &amp; the <a id="l92"></a>same kingdom till the death of Hermaneric.</p>
<p id="par8">The Goths &amp; other Scythian nations beyond the Danube had ...<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 2r resumes &gt; </span> The Goths &amp; other scythian nations beyond the Danube <a id="l93"></a>had hitherto lived without letters, &amp; the Christian religion <a id="l94"></a>had been hitherto propagated among them only by oral tradition. <a id="l95"></a>But now Vlphilas the Patriarch of Dacia invented the Gothic <a id="l96"></a>letters &amp; translated the scriptures into the language of Dacia <a id="l97"></a>&amp; propagated the Christian religion very much among the Goths <a id="l98"></a>&amp; Gepides so that Fridigern king of the Visigoths became a Christian <a id="l99"></a>&amp; Athanaric fearing that the Christian religion should also <a id="l100"></a>prevail in his kingdom (for Vlphilas instructed the people of both <a id="l101"></a>kingdoms) raised a vehement persecution against the Christians <a id="l102"></a>&amp; put many of them to death.</p>
<p id="par9">In those days the Hunns, a fierce &amp; brutish nation seated <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> upon the eastern side of the lake Mæotis &amp; river Tanais, rose <a id="l103"></a>from their seats &amp; under the conduct of their king Balamber <a id="l104"></a>or Balamir invaded the nations which lay between them &amp; <a id="l105"></a>Dacia &amp; chiefly the Alans a Gothic nation &amp; soon after the death of Hermaneric entred  Dacia &amp; made the people either submit or fly. The Ostrogoths <a id="l107"></a>submitted but the Gruthungi  made some resistance their King Winitharius having <a id="l108"></a>strengthned himself by conquering the Antes the year before the <a id="l109"></a>Hunns invaded him. He beat the Hunns in one or two battels <a id="l110"></a>but was slain by Balamir in the third battel &amp; his kingdom <a id="l111"></a>was given to Hunnimund. For Sigismund the son of Hunnimund <a id="l112"></a>had assisted the Hunns in this war with an army of Ostro<a id="l113"></a>goths. After this the Hunns pursued Athanaric, &amp; the greatest <a id="l114"></a>part of his people  deserting him fled with some other Goths <a id="l115"></a>to the side of the Danube under the conduct of Alavivus. <a id="l116"></a>Fridigern also fled thither with his people the Visigoths. And <a id="l117"></a>these nations sent an embassy to the Emperor Valens &amp; <a id="l118"></a>obteined leave to pass the Danube &amp; seat themselves <a id="l119"></a>in Mœsia &amp; Thrace. Their patriarch Vlphilas was at the head of this embassy.  And presently after, a great part <a id="l120"></a>of the Gruthungi under the conduct of Alatheus &amp; Saphrase <a id="l121"></a>the guardians of Videric the young son of Winitharius <a id="l122"></a>(now their king) flying from the Huns &amp; Ostrogoths came <a id="l123"></a>to the side of the Danube &amp; made the same petition but <a id="l124"></a>were rejected. Yet they passed the Danube soon after <a id="l125"></a>without leave, while the Roman army was detained in <a id="l126"></a>Rhætia in a war against the Alemans &amp; Sueves.  <a id="l127"></a>This rout was in the year 377.</p>
<p id="par10">The Goths being seated in the Empire were soon prest <a id="l128"></a>with famin &amp; grosly abused by the Roman Governours who <a id="l129"></a>sold them dogs flesh &amp; other carrion at high rates &amp; otherwise provoked them. Whereupon they took up arms <a id="l130"></a>invaded Thrace, called to their assistance some Goths Hunns &amp; <a id="l131"></a>Alans from beyond the Danube routed the Roman Army, slew <a id="l132"></a>the Emperor Valens &amp; spread themselves into Greece &amp; <a id="l133"></a>Pannonia as far as the Alps, Alatheus &amp; Saphrax going <a id="l134"></a>westward. This was in the year 378. But in the years 379 &amp; 380 they were chect by <a id="l135"></a>the arms of the Emperors Gratian &amp; Theodosius &amp; made a <a id="l136"></a>submissive peace &amp; the Visigoths &amp; Thervingi returned to <a id="l137"></a>their seats in Mœsia &amp; Thrace, the Hunns retired over the <a id="l138"></a>Danube &amp; the Alans &amp; Gruthungi obteined seats in  Panno<a id="l139"></a>nia.<sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> During this war Athanaric king of the Thervingi came over the Danube &amp; now <a id="l141"></a>made the Emperor Theodosius a visit at Constantinople, was ho<a id="l142"></a>nourably received, died in a few days in Ianuary 1681 after a reign of 13 years, &amp; was splendidly interred, <a id="l143"></a>&amp; his people seing this treatment, subjected themselves immediately to the <a id="l144"></a>Emperor without chusing another king. But Fridigern King <a id="l145"></a>of the Visigoths was succeeded by Alaric &amp; Videric king of the <a id="l146"></a>Gruthungi by Radagaisus.</p>

Iornandes tells us that the royal family of the <a id="l150"></a>Vandals was of the stock of the Asdingi &amp; Dio that the Astingi under <a id="l151"></a>the conduct of Rhaus &amp; Rhaptus entred Dacia in the reign of the <a id="l152"></a>Emperor Marcus &amp; had seats granted them there by that Emperor. <a id="l153"></a>From that time therefore the Astingi, Asdingi or Vandals were <a id="l154"></a>members of the Roman Empire. They were seated on the eastern <a id="l155"></a>side of the river Teys where the rivers Maresh &amp; Keresh run <a id="l156"></a>westward into it. In the reign of Constantine the great they were <a id="l157"></a>conquered by the Gepides &amp; left these their seats to the conque<a id="l158"></a>rors &amp; had seats granted them in Pannonia by that Emperor. <a id="l159"></a> <a id="l160"></a>Iornandes tells us that they lived quietly in Pannonia 40 <a id="l161"></a>years &amp; long after that invaded Gallia. And a little after <a id="l162"></a>he says that when Alatheus &amp; Safrach invaded Panno<a id="l163"></a>nia, Gratian was gone from Rome into Gallia by reason <a id="l164"></a>of an incursion of the Vandals. He reccons therefore <a id="l165"></a>that the Vandals lived quietly in Pannonia 40 years <a id="l166"></a>untill this incursion &amp; long after this incursion invaded <a id="l167"></a>Gallia a second time. But he seems to be mistaken in <a id="l168"></a>ascribing this incursion to the Vandals. It was against <a id="l169"></a>the Alemans  a German nation seated upon the upper <a id="l170"></a>Rhene that Gratian went at this time into Gallia. And <a id="l171"></a>the Vandals staid in Pannonia 30 years longer, in all <a id="l172"></a>70 years or above before they invaded Gallia. And by <a id="l173"></a>their long stay in the Roman Empire, first in Dacia <a id="l174"></a>&amp; then in Pannonia, the Christian religion prevailed <a id="l175"></a>amongst them. They lived in Pannonia without a king <a id="l176"></a>&amp; at length  upon new commotions of the Gothic nations  &amp; Hunns coming over the Danube they rose from those seats  &amp; made Godegisi<a id="l177"></a>lus a Christian their Capitain &amp; taking along with <a id="l178"></a>them the Alans &amp; some other nations in their way to <a id="l179"></a>the Rhene they invaded Gallia while Rhadagaisus &amp; Alaric invaded <a id="l180"></a>Italy &amp; the Hunns &amp; Ostrogoths Pannonia &amp; by these invasions &amp; <a id="l181"></a>the revolt of the Salian Franks &amp; British soldiers, the <a id="l182"></a>western empire at once brake into ten kingdoms, the <a id="l183"></a>history of which is as follows.</p>

Thereupon <a id="l191"></a>Alaric  made peace with the Emperor being so far humbled that  Orosius tells <a id="l192"></a>us he did <em class="underline">pro pace optima &amp;  quibuscunque sedibus supplicitur <a id="l193"></a>&amp; simpliciter orare</em>. This peace <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> was ratified by mutual hostages &amp; Ætius was <a id="l195"></a>sent hostage to Alaric.</p>
<p id="par13">When Alaric took up arms, the nations beyond the Danube <a id="l196"></a>began to be in motion &amp; the next winter (the winter between A.C. 395 <a id="l197"></a>&amp; A.C. 396) a great body of Hunns, Alans, Ostrogoths &amp; other northern <a id="l198"></a>nations came over the frozen Danube, being invited by Ruffin; &amp; <a id="l199"></a>their brethren also who had obteined seats within the Empire took <a id="l200"></a>up arms. Ierome calls all this great multitude Hunns, Alans, Vandals <a id="l201"></a>Goths, Sarmatans, Quades &amp; Marcomanns, &amp; saith that they invaded <a id="l202"></a>all places between Constantinople &amp; the Iulian alps, wasting Scythia <a id="l203"></a>Thrace Macedon Dardania Dacia Thessaly Achaia Epire Dalmatia <a id="l204"></a>&amp; all Pannonia. And the Suevians also invaded Rhætia. For when <a id="l205"></a>Alaric   ravaged Pannonia the Romans were defending Rhætia <a id="l206"></a>which gave Alaric an opportunity of invading Italy, as Claudian thus <a id="l207"></a>mentions.</p>

</div>
<p id="par14" class="i0">And when Alaric went from those parts into Italy, some other bar<a id="l209"></a>barous nations invaded Noricum &amp; Vindelicia as the same Claudian thus <a id="l210"></a>mentions.</p>

</div>
<p id="par15" class="i0">Among these nations I reccon the Suevians Quades &amp; Marcomans. For <a id="l211"></a>they were all in arms at this time, &amp; the Quades &amp; Marcomans were <a id="l212"></a>Suevian nations, &amp; now united with the Suevians under one common <a id="l213"></a>king  called Ermeric  who soon after led them into Gallia. The Vandals &amp; <a id="l214"></a>Alans might also about this time extend themselves into Noricum. <a id="l215"></a>Also Vldin with a new great body of Hunns passed the Danube <a id="l216"></a>about the time of Chrysostoms banishment, that is, A.C. 404 &amp; <a id="l217"></a>wasted Thrace &amp; Mœsia. And Radagaisus king of the Gruthungi <a id="l218"></a>inviting over more barbarians from beyond the Danube, invaded <a id="l219"></a>Italy with an army of above 200000 Goths  &amp; the <a id="l220"></a>next year A.C. 405 or 406 was overcome by Stilico &amp; perished with his <a id="l221"></a>army. In this war Stilico was assisted by a great body of Hunns &amp; Ostrogoths under the <a id="l222"></a>conduct of Vldin &amp; Sarus. They were hired by the Emperor Honorius.</p>
<p id="par16">And now Stilico purposing to make himself Emperor, pro<a id="l223"></a>cured a military Præfecture for Alarick, &amp; sent him into the <a id="l224"></a>east in the service of Honorius the western Emperor, committing <a id="l225"></a>some Roman troops to his conduct to strengthen his army of Goths. <a id="l226"></a>&amp; promising to follow soon after with his own army. His pretence <a id="l227"></a>was to recover some regions of Illyricum which the eastern Emperor <a id="l228"></a>was accused to detein injuriously from the western: but his secret <a id="l229"></a>designe was to make himself Emperor by the assistance of the Vandals <a id="l230"></a>&amp; their allies; for he himself was a Vandal. For faciliating this designe <a id="l231"></a>he invited a great body of the barbarous nations to invade the western <a id="l232"></a>Empire while he &amp; Alaric invaded the eastern. And these nations under <a id="l233"></a>their several kings, the Vandals under Godegisilus, the Alans in two bodies the one under <a id="l234"></a>Goar the other under Resplendial &amp; the Suevians Quades &amp; Marcomans under Ermeric <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 4r resumes &gt; </span>

Then they advanced <a id="l272"></a>into Belgium &amp; began to ruffle that country. Whereupon <a id="l273"></a>the Salian Franks (a German nation whom the Emperors <a id="l274"></a>had sometime before received into the Empire,  &amp; placed as <a id="l275"></a>subjects in that part of Belgium which lies between Brabant <a id="l276"></a>&amp; the Rhene,) took up arms &amp; made so stout a resistance <a id="l277"></a>that they slew almost twenty thousand of the Vandals which <a id="l278"></a>their king Godegisilus in battel, the rest escaping only by <a id="l279"></a>a party of Resplendials Alans which came timely to their <a id="l280"></a>assistance.</p>
<p id="par17">Resplendial seing this disaster &amp; that Goar was  gone over to <a id="l281"></a>the Romans  led his army from the Rhene &amp; together with <a id="l282"></a>the Suevians &amp; residue of the Vandals went towards Spain, the <a id="l283"></a>Franks in the meane time prosecuting their victory so far as <a id="l284"></a>to retake Trevirs, which after they had plundred they left to <a id="l285"></a>the Romans. The barbarians were at first stopt by the Pyre<a id="l286"></a>nean mountains, which made them diffuse themselves into Aqui<a id="l287"></a>tane, but the next year they had the passage betrayed to <a id="l288"></a>them, &amp; entring Spain 4 Kal. Octob.  A.C. 409, every one <a id="l289"></a>conquered there what he could, &amp; at length A.C. 411 they <a id="l290"></a> divided their conquests by lot, &amp; the Vandals obteined <a id="l291"></a>Bœtica &amp; part of Gallæcia, the Suevians the rest of Gal<a id="l292"></a>læcia, &amp; the Alans Lusitania &amp; the Carthaginensian <a id="l293"></a>Province, the Emperor for peace sake confirming them <a id="l294"></a>in those seats by grant. A.C. 413.</p>
<p id="par18">In the mean time the British soldiers allarm'd by <a id="l295"></a>the rumour of these things, revolt &amp; set up Tyrants there, <a id="l296"></a>first Marcus whom they slew presently, then Gratian <a id="l297"></a>whom they slew within four months, &amp; lastly Constan<a id="l298"></a>tine under whom they invaded Gallia A.C. 408. And Con<a id="l299"></a>stantine having possest a good part of Gallia created his <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> son Constans Cæsar &amp; sent him into Spain to order his affairs <a id="l300"></a>there: about which time it was that the barbarous nations <a id="l301"></a>were let into Spain by some of the soldiers of Constans <a id="l302"></a>betraying the Pyrenean passage to them.</p>
<p id="par19">Also the Roman Franks above mentioned having made <a id="l303"></a>Theudemir the Prince of their old royall family king <a id="l304"></a>over them, began streight after their conquest of the <a id="l305"></a>Vandals to invade their neighbours. The first they set <a id="l306"></a>upon were the Galls of Brabant<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup>, but meeting with  <a id="l311"></a>notable resistance they desired their alliance. And so those <a id="l312"></a>Galls fell off from the Romans &amp; the two nations made <a id="l313"></a>an intimate league to be as one people, marrying with <a id="l314"></a>one another &amp; conforming to one another's manners <a id="l315"></a>till they became one without distinction. Thus by the <a id="l316"></a>access of these Galls &amp; of the foreign Franks also who <a id="l317"></a>afterwards came over the Rhene, the Salian  <a id="l318"></a>kingdom soon grew very great &amp; powerfull.</p>
<p id="par20">About the same time Stilico's expedition against <a id="l319"></a>the Greek Emperor being stopt by the order of Hono<a id="l320"></a>rius, Alaric came out of Epire into Noricum &amp; re<a id="l321"></a>quested a summ of money for his service. The senate <a id="l322"></a>were inclined to deny him but by Stilico's mediation <a id="l323"></a>granted it. But after a while Stilico being  accused of <a id="l324"></a>a traiterous conspiracy which Alaric &amp; slain 10 Kal. <a id="l325"></a>Sept. A.C. 408 &amp; so Alaric disappointed of his money <a id="l326"></a>&amp; reputed an enemy to the Empire, he  <a id="l327"></a> broke streight into Italy which his army which he <a id="l328"></a>brought out of Epire, &amp; sent to his brother Adaulphus <a id="l329"></a>to follow him with what other forces he had in <a id="l330"></a>Pannonia which were not great but yet not to be <a id="l331"></a>despised. Thereupon Honorius fearing to be shut up <a id="l332"></a>in Rome retired to Ravenna in October A.C. 408, and <a id="l333"></a>from that time Ravenna continued to be the seat of <a id="l334"></a>the western Emperors.  In those days the Hunns <a id="l335"></a>also invaded Pannonia &amp; seizing the deserted seats of <a id="l336"></a>the Vandals Alans &amp; Goths founded a new kingdom there. And Alaric ad<a id="l337"></a>vancing to Rome beseiged it &amp; 9 Kal. Sept. A.C. 410 took it &amp; afterwards <a id="l338"></a>attempting to pass into Afric was shipwrackt. After which Ho<a id="l339"></a>norius made peace with him &amp; got up an army to send  <a id="l340"></a>against the Tyrant Constantine.</p>
<p id="par21">At the same time Gerontius one of Constantine's Captains <a id="l341"></a>revolted from him &amp; set up one Maximus Emperor in Spain <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> whereupon Constantine sent Edobec another of his Captains to <a id="l342"></a>draw to his assistance, besides the barbarians under Goar &amp; Gundicar  in <a id="l343"></a>Gallia, supplies of Franks &amp; Alemans from beyond the Rhene, <a id="l344"></a>&amp; committed the custody of  Vienna in Narbonne to his son <a id="l345"></a>Constans. Gerontius advancing, first slew Constans at Vienna, <a id="l346"></a>&amp; then began to beseige Constantine at  Arles: but Hono<a id="l347"></a>rius at the same time sending Constantius which an army on <a id="l348"></a>the same errand, Gerontius fled &amp; Constantius continued the <a id="l349"></a>siege being strengthned by the access of the greatest part <a id="l350"></a>of Gerontius's soldiers. After four months siege, Edobec <a id="l351"></a>having procured succours, the barbarian kings at Ments Goar <a id="l352"></a>&amp; Gundicar  constitute Iovinus Emperor &amp; together which him set forward <a id="l353"></a>to releive  Arles. At their approach Constantius <a id="l354"></a>retired, they pursued &amp; he beat them by surprize, but <a id="l355"></a>not prosecuting his victory, the Barbarians soon recovered <a id="l356"></a>themselves, yet not so as to hinder the fall of the <a id="l357"></a>Tyrants Constantine, Iovinus &amp; Maximus. But Brittain could not be recovered to the Em<a id="l358"></a>pire, but remained ever after a distinct kingdom.</p>
<p id="par22">The next year A.C. 412 the Goths being beaten in Italy <a id="l359"></a>had Aquitain granted to retire thence into &amp; they invaded <a id="l360"></a>it which much violence, causing the Alans &amp; Burgundians <a id="l361"></a>to retreat which were then depopulating it. At the same time <a id="l362"></a>the Burgundians were brought to terms of peace &amp; the <a id="l363"></a>Emperor granted them  for inheritance <a id="l364"></a>a region upon the Rhene which they had invaded. And <a id="l365"></a>the same I presume he did which the Alans. But the Franks <a id="l366"></a>not long after retaking &amp; burning Trevirs, Castinus A.C. 415 <a id="l367"></a>was sent against them with an army &amp; routed them &amp; slew <a id="l368"></a>Theudemir their king.  This was <a id="l369"></a>the second taking of Trevirs by the Franks. And Meroveus <a id="l370"></a>about the year 448 took it again &amp; destroyed it. so that it <a id="l371"></a>was taken four times once by the Vandals &amp; thrice by the <a id="l372"></a>Franks. Pharamund the son of Marcomir or, as others say, the son of Suno reigned after Theudemir, &amp; had seats <a id="l373"></a>granted to his nation neare the Rhene.</p>
<p id="par23">And now the Barbarians were all quieted &amp; setled <a id="l374"></a>in several  kingdoms within the empire not only by <a id="l375"></a>conquest but also by the grants of the Emperor Honorius. <a id="l376"></a>For Rutilius in his Itinerary written in autumn anno Vrbis <a id="l377"></a>1169, that is, according to Varro's computation then in use, <a id="l378"></a>A.C. 416, thus laments the wasted fields of France.</p>

If you date the years of Honorius from the death of his father, the reign of Pharamund might begin two years later <a id="l568"></a>then is assigned by <a id="l569"></a>Bucher.

<p id="par51">8 The kings of Brittain were A.C 408 Marcus, Gratian, <a id="l610"></a>&amp; Constantine successively.

The three first were <a id="l614"></a>Tyrants who revolted from the Empire.

The just time I thus collect  Marcus reigned not many days Gratian four <a id="l620"></a>months &amp; Constantine three years. He was slain the year <a id="l621"></a>after the sacking of Rome  that is A.C. 411, 14 Kal <a id="l622"></a>Octob. Whence the revolt was in spring A.C. 408.

Now the reign of these Tyrants was but short <a id="l626"></a>yet they gave a beginning to the kingdom of Brittain &amp; so <a id="l627"></a>may be recconed the three first kings, especially since the <a id="l628"></a>posterity of Constantine (viz<sup>t</sup> his sons Aurelius Ambrosius &amp; Vther <a id="l629"></a>Pendraco  &amp; grandson Arthur) reigned afterwards. For <a id="l630"></a>from the time of the revolt of these Tyrants Brittain con<a id="l631"></a>tinued a distinct kingdom absolved from subjection to the <a id="l632"></a>Empire, the Emperor not being able to spare soldiers to be sent <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span>thither to recover &amp; keep the Island &amp; so neglecting it: as we <a id="l633"></a>learn by unquestionable records. For Prosper tells us A.C. 410 <a id="l634"></a>Variane Cos. Hac tempestate præ valetudine Romanorum, vires <a id="l635"></a>funditus attenuatæ Britanniæ. And Sigebert conjoyning this <a id="l636"></a>with the siege of Rome saith Britannorum vires attenuatæ <a id="l637"></a>&amp; substrahunt se a Romanorum dominatione.

Therefore the Brittains taking up arms &amp; hazzarding <a id="l644"></a>themselves for their own safety, they freed their cities from <a id="l645"></a> the imminent barbarians. In like manner all<sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> Brabant &amp; <a id="l652"></a>other Provinces of the Galls imitating the Brittains freed them<a id="l653"></a>selves after the same manner, ejecting the Roman Presidents <a id="l654"></a>&amp; forming a certain Commonwealth according to their own <a id="l655"></a>pleasure. This rebellion of Brittain &amp; the Celtic nations hap<a id="l656"></a>pened when Constantine usurpt the kingdom. So also Procopius <a id="l657"></a>(l. 1 Vand.) speaking of the same Constantine saith <em class="underline">Constantine <a id="l658"></a>being overcome in battel was slain with his children</em>: Βρετταννί<a id="l659"></a>αν μέν τοι Ρωμαῖοι ανασώσασθαι οὐκέτι ἔχον. ἀλλ᾽ οὖσα <a id="l660"></a>ὑπὸ τυράννοις ἀπ᾽ ἀυτοῦ ἔμενε: <em class="underline">yet the Romans could not <a id="l661"></a>recover Brittain any more, but from that time it remained <a id="l662"></a>under Tyrants</em>.

I date the  reign of the Hunns in Pannonia from the time that the <a id="l697"></a>Vandals &amp; Alans relinquished Pannonia to them A.C. 406, Sigonius from the <a id="l698"></a>time that the Visigoths relinquished Pannonia A.C. 408. <em class="underline">Constat,</em> saith he <sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> <em class="underline">quod Gothis ex Illyrico  pro<a id="l700"></a>fectis Hunni successerunt atque imprimis Pannoniam tenue<a id="l701"></a>runt.

How Ætius was hostage <a id="l706"></a>to the Goths &amp; Hunns is related by Frigeridus who when <a id="l707"></a>he had mentioned that Theodosius Emperor of the east had <a id="l708"></a>sent grievous commands to Iohn who after the death of <a id="l709"></a>Honorius had usurped the crown of the western Empire, he <a id="l710"></a>subjoyns. <em class="underline">Iis permotus Ioannes Ætium id temporis Curam <a id="l711"></a>Palatij gerentem cum ingenti auri pondere ad Chunnos <a id="l712"></a>transmisit notos sibi obsidiatûs sui tempore &amp; familiari ami<a id="l713"></a>citia devinctos</em> – And a little after: <em class="underline">Ætius tribus annis <a id="l714"></a>Alarici obses, dehuic Chunnorum, posthæc Carpilionis gener <a id="l715"></a>ex Comite domesticorum &amp; Ioannis Cura palatij</em>. Now Bucher <a id="l716"></a>shews that Ætius was hostage to Alaric till the year 410 <a id="l717"></a>when Alaric died &amp; to the Huns between the years 411 &amp; 415 <a id="l718"></a>&amp; son in law to Carpilio about the year 417 or 418 &amp; <a id="l719"></a>Curapalates to Iohn about the end of the year 423. Whence <a id="l720"></a>its probable that he became hostage to the Hunns about <a id="l721"></a>the year 412 or 413 when Honorius made leagues with <a id="l722"></a>almost all the barbarous nations &amp; granted them seats. But <a id="l723"></a>I had rather say with Sigonius that Ætius became hostage to Alaric A.C. 403. <a id="l724"></a>Its further manifest out of Prosper that the Hunns <a id="l725"></a>were in quiet possession of Pannonia in the year 432. <a id="l726"></a>For in the 1<sup>st</sup> book of Eusebius's chronicle Prosper writes <a id="l727"></a>Anno 10<sup>mo</sup> post obitum Honorij cum ad Chunnorum gentem <a id="l728"></a>cui tunc Rugúla præerat, post prælium cum Bonifacio <a id="l729"></a>se Ætius contulisset, impetrato auxilio ad Romanorum solum <a id="l730"></a>regreditur. And in the 2<sup>d</sup> book: Ætio et Valerio Coss: Ætius <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span> deposita potestate profugus ad Hunnos in Pannonia per<a id="l731"></a>venit quorum amicitia auxilioque usus pacem principum <a id="l732"></a>interpellatæ potestatis obtinuit. Hereby it appears that <a id="l733"></a>at this time Rugila (or as Maximus calls him Rechilla) reigned over the Hunns in Pannonia <a id="l734"></a>&amp; that Pannonia was not now so much as accounted within the soile <a id="l735"></a>of the Empire, being formerly granted away to the Hunns, <a id="l736"></a>&amp; that these were the very same Hunns which which Ætius <a id="l737"></a>had in the time of his being an hostage contracted friend<a id="l738"></a>ship, by virtue of which as he sollicited them before to the <a id="l739"></a>aid of Iohn the Tyrant A.C. 424 so now he procured <a id="l740"></a>their intercession for himself which the Emperor. Octar <a id="l741"></a>died A.C. 430, for Socrates tells us that about that time <a id="l742"></a>the Burgundians having been newly vext by the Hunns <a id="l743"></a>upon intelligence of Octars death seing them without <a id="l744"></a>a leader set upon them suddenly with so great suc<a id="l745"></a>cess that 3000 Burgundians slew 10000 Hunns. Of <a id="l746"></a>Rugila's being now king in Pannonia you have heard <a id="l747"></a>already. He died A.C. 433 &amp; was succeeded by Bleda as <a id="l748"></a>Prosper &amp; Maximus inform us. This Bleda with his <a id="l749"></a>brother Attila were before this time kings of the Hunns <a id="l750"></a>beyond the Danube, their father Munzuc's kingdom <a id="l751"></a>being divided between them &amp; now they united the <a id="l752"></a>kingdom of Pannonia to their own. Whence Paulus <a id="l753"></a>Diaconus saith they did Regnum intra Pannoniam <a id="l754"></a>Daciamque gerere. In the year 441 they began to <a id="l755"></a>invade the Empire afresh adding to the Pannonian <a id="l756"></a>forces new &amp; great armies from Scythia: but this <a id="l757"></a>war was presently composed &amp; then Attila  <a id="l758"></a>seing Bleda inclined to peace slew him A.C. 444 <a id="l759"></a>inherited his dominions &amp; invaded the Empire afresh. <a id="l760"></a>  But  <a id="l768"></a>At length after various great wars with the Romans Attila perished A.C. 454, <a id="l769"></a>&amp; his sons quarrelling about his dominions gave occasion <a id="l770"></a>to the Gepides Ostrogoths &amp; other nations who were <a id="l771"></a>their subjects, to rebell &amp; make war upon them. And <a id="l772"></a>the same year the Ostrogoths had seats granted them <a id="l773"></a>in Pannonia by the Emperors Marcian &amp; Valentinian <a id="l774"></a>&amp; with the Romans ejected the Hunns out of Pannonia <a id="l775"></a>soon after the death of Attila as all historians agree <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017r"> &lt;17r&gt; </span> This ejection was in the reign of Avitus as is mentioned in the <a id="l776"></a>Chronicum Boiorum &amp; in Sidonius Carm. 7 in Avitum which speaks <a id="l777"></a>of that Emperor</p>

<p id="par54" class="i0">The Poet means that by the coming of Avitus the Hunns yeilded <a id="l778"></a>more easily to the Goths. This was written by Sidonius in the be<a id="l779"></a>ginning of the reign of Avitus. And his reign began in the <a id="l780"></a>end of the year 455, &amp; lasted not one full year.</p>
<p id="par55">Iornandes tells us;  <em class="underline">Duodecimo anno regni Waliæ post <a id="l781"></a>pene quinquaginta annos invasa Pannonia, Hunni a Romanis <a id="l782"></a>et Gothis pulsi sunt</em>. And Marcelline: <em class="underline">Hierio et Ardaburio Coss. <a id="l783"></a>Pannoniæ quæ per quinquaginta annos ab Hunnis retineban<a id="l784"></a>tur, a Romanis receptæ sunt</em>. Whence it should seem that the <a id="l785"></a>Hunns invaded &amp; held Pannonia from the year 378 or 379 <a id="l786"></a>to the year 427 &amp; then were driver out of it. But this <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>is<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> a <a id="l787"></a>plane mistake. For its certain that the Emperor Theodosius <a id="l788"></a>left the Empire entire. And we have shewed out of Prosper <a id="l789"></a>that the Hunns were in quiet possession of Pannonia in the <a id="l790"></a>year 432. The Visigoths in those days had nothing to do <a id="l791"></a>with Pannonia, &amp; the Ostrogoths continued subject to the <a id="l792"></a>Hunns till the death of Attalus A.C. 454, &amp; Vallia king of <a id="l793"></a>the Visigoths did not reign twelve years. He began his reign <a id="l794"></a>in the end of the year 415, reigned three years &amp; was slain <a id="l795"></a>A.C. 419 as Idasius, Isidorus, &amp; the Spanish manuscript Chro<a id="l796"></a>nicles seem by Grotius, testify. Yea Olympiodorus, who produces <a id="l797"></a>his history only to the year 425 sets down therein the death <a id="l798"></a>of  Valia king of the Visigoths &amp; conjoyns it with that of <a id="l799"></a>Constantius which happened A.C. 420. Wherefore the Valia of <a id="l800"></a>Iornandes who reigned at least 12 years, is some other king <a id="l801"></a>And I suspect that this name has been put by mistake for  Valamir king of the Ostrogoths. For the action recorded <a id="l803"></a>was of the Romans &amp; Ostrogoths driving the Hunns out of Pan<a id="l804"></a>nonia after the death of Attila. And it is not likely that the <a id="l805"></a>historian would refer the history of the Ostrogoths to the years <a id="l806"></a>of the Visigothic kings. This action happened in the end of the <a id="l807"></a>year 455, which I take to be the twelft year of Valamir in <a id="l808"></a>Pannonia &amp; which was almost fifty years after the year 406 <a id="l809"></a>in which the Hunns succeeded the Vandals &amp; Alans in Panno<a id="l810"></a>nia. Vpon the ceasing of the line of Hunnimund the son <a id="l811"></a>of Hermaneric, the Ostrogoths lived without kings of their <a id="l812"></a>own nation about 40 years together, being subject to the Hunns. <a id="l813"></a>And when Attila began to make war upon the Romans. <a id="l814"></a>which was in the year 444, he made Valamir with his <a id="l815"></a>brothers Theodemir &amp; Vidimer the grandsons of Vinithar <a id="l816"></a>Captains  or kings of these Ostrogoths under him. And <a id="l817"></a>in the tweft year of Valamir's reign dated from thence <a id="l818"></a>the Hunns were driven out of Pannonia.</p>
<p id="par56">Yet the Hunns were not so ejected but that they had <a id="l819"></a>further contests with the Romans till the head of Denfix the <a id="l820"></a>son of Attila A.C. 469 (in the Consulship of Zeno &amp; Marcian <a id="l821"></a>as Marcelline relates) was carried to Constantinople. Nor were <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span> they yet totally ejected the Empire. For besides their reliques <a id="l822"></a>in Pannonia, Sigonius tells us that when the Emperors Mar<a id="l823"></a>cian &amp; Valentinan granted Pannonia to the Goths (which <a id="l824"></a>was in the year 454) they granted some part of Illyricum <a id="l825"></a>to some of the Hunns &amp; Sarmatans: And in the year 526 <a id="l826"></a>when the Lombards removing into Pannonia made war there <a id="l827"></a>upon the Gepides, the Avares (a part of the Hunns who had <a id="l828"></a> now taken the name of Avares from one of their <a id="l829"></a>kings) assisted the Lombards in that war, &amp; the Lombards <a id="l830"></a>afterwards when they went into Italy, left their seats in <a id="l831"></a>Pannonia to the Avares in recompence of their friendship <a id="l832"></a>And from that time the Hunns grew again very powerfull <a id="l833"></a>their kings (whom they called Chagan) troubling the Empire <a id="l834"></a>very much in the reigns of the Emperors Mauricius Phocas <a id="l835"></a>&amp; Heraclius. And this is the original of the present kingdom <a id="l836"></a>of Hungary, which from these Avares &amp; other Hunns mixed <a id="l837"></a>together, took the name of Hun-Avaria, &amp; by contraction <a id="l838"></a>Hungary.</p>
<p id="par57">10. The Lombards came over the Danube into the Em<a id="l839"></a>pire, beat the Vandals, &amp; seated themselves in Pannonia <a id="l840"></a>A.C. 379 379 as above. After the death of their Captains Ibor <a id="l841"></a>&amp; Ayon, they had kings, Agilmundus, Lamisso, Lechu, Hildehoc, <a id="l842"></a>Gudehoc, Claffo, Tato, Wacho, Walter, Audoin, Alboin, <a id="l843"></a>Cleophis &amp;c. Agilmundus was the son of Ayon &amp; became their <a id="l844"></a>king (according to Prosper) in the Consulship of Honorius &amp; <a id="l845"></a>Theodosius, A.C. 389, &amp; reigned 33 years according to Paulus <a id="l846"></a>Warnefridus. But considering that the Lombards were at <a id="l847"></a>this time a small kingdom, its probable that they continued <a id="l848"></a>in Pannonia by the permission of the Romans &amp; like the <a id="l849"></a>other barbarous nations lived quietly under them till after <a id="l850"></a>the death of Theodosius the great. And that in the reign of his sons when Pannonia <a id="l851"></a>was invaded by the Goths &amp; other barbarians (suppose about <a id="l852"></a>the year 400 or 402) they stood upon their own defence <a id="l853"></a>the Romans being no longer able to protect them &amp; keep <a id="l854"></a>them in obedience. Agilmundus was slain by the Bulgars <a id="l855"></a>a people so called from the river Volga from whence they <a id="l856"></a>came. Prosper places his death in the Consulship of Marini<a id="l857"></a>anus &amp; Asclepiodorus A.C. 423. Lamisso routed the Bulgars <a id="l858"></a>&amp; reigned three years &amp; Lechu almost forty. Gudehoc was con<a id="l859"></a>temporary to Odoacer king of the Heruli in Italy, &amp; about <a id="l860"></a>the year 478 led his people from Pannonia into Rugia <a id="l861"></a>a country on the north side of Noricum next beyond the – <a id="l862"></a>Danube,  from whence Odoacer then carried the Rugians <a id="l863"></a> into Italy. Tato overthrew the kingdom of the Heruli <a id="l864"></a>beyond the Danube &amp; Wacho conquered the Suevians a king<a id="l865"></a>dom then bounded on the east by Bavaria, on the west by France <a id="l866"></a>&amp; on the south by the Burgundians. Audoin returned into Pan<a id="l867"></a>nonia A.C. 526 &amp; there overcame the Gepides. Alboin A.C. 551 <a id="l868"></a>overthrew the kingdom of the Gepides &amp; slew their king Cun<a id="l869"></a>nimundus, &amp; A.C. 563 assisted the Greek Emperor against Totila <a id="l870"></a>king of the Ostrogoths in Italy, &amp; A.C. 568 led his people out <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span> of Pannonia into Lombardy where they reigned till the year <a id="l871"></a>774.</p>
<p id="par58">11. These ten kingdoms being rent away we are next to <a id="l872"></a>consider the residue of the western Empire. While this Empire <a id="l873"></a>continued entire it was the Beast himself: but the residue <a id="l874"></a>thereof is but a part of him. And if this part be considered <a id="l875"></a>as a horn, the reign of this horn may be dated from the <a id="l876"></a>translation of the Imperial seat from Rome to Ravenna, <a id="l877"></a>which was in October A.C. 408. For then the Emperor <a id="l878"></a>Honorius fearing that Alaric would besiege him in Rome <a id="l879"></a>if he stayed there, retired to Millain, &amp; thence to Ravenna; <a id="l880"></a>&amp; the ensuing siege &amp; sacking of Rome confirmed his residence <a id="l881"></a>there, so that he &amp; his successors ever after made it their <a id="l882"></a>home. And accordingly Machiavel in his Florentine History <a id="l883"></a>writes that Valentinian having left Rome translated the <a id="l884"></a>seat of the Empire to Ravenna.</p>
<p id="par59">Rhætia belonged to the western Emperors so long as that <a id="l885"></a>Empire stood, &amp; then it descended  with Italy &amp; the Roman <a id="l886"></a>Senate to Odoacer king of the Heruli in Italy &amp; after him to <a id="l887"></a>Theoderic king of the Ostrogoths &amp; his successors by the grant of <a id="l888"></a>the Greek Emperors. Vpon the death of Valentinian the second <a id="l889"></a>the Alemans &amp; Suevians invaded Rhætia A.C. 455. But I <a id="l890"></a>do not find that they erected any standing kingdome there. <a id="l891"></a>For in the year 457 while they were yet depopulating Rhætia <a id="l892"></a>they were attaqued &amp; beaten by Burto the Master of the horse <a id="l893"></a>to the Emperor Majoranus: &amp; I hear nothing more of their <a id="l894"></a>invading Rhætia. Clodovæus king of France in or about the <a id="l895"></a>year 496 conquered a kingdom of the Alemans &amp; Suevians <a id="l896"></a>&amp; slew their last king Ermeric. But this kingdom was seated <a id="l897"></a>in Germany &amp; only bordered upon Rhætia. For its people fled <a id="l898"></a>from Clodovæus into the neighbouring kingdom of the Ostrogoths <a id="l899"></a>under Theoderic. And Theoderic received them as friends <a id="l900"></a>&amp; wrote a friendly letter to Clodovæus in their behalf. <a id="l901"></a>And by this means they became inhabitants of Rhætia as subjects <a id="l902"></a>under the dominion of the Ostrogoths.</p>
<p id="par60">When the Greek Emperor conquered the Ostrogoths <a id="l903"></a>he succeeded them in the kingdom of Ravenna not only <a id="l904"></a>by right of  conquest but also by right of inheritance <a id="l905"></a>the Roman Senate still going along with this kingdom. And <a id="l906"></a>therefore we may reccon that this kingdom continued in the <a id="l907"></a>Exarchate of Ravenna &amp; Senate of Rome. For the Remainder <a id="l908"></a>of the Western Empire went along with the Senate of Rome <a id="l909"></a>by reason of the right which this Senate still retained &amp; at <a id="l910"></a>length exerted, of chusing a western Emperor.</p>
<p id="par61">I have now enumerated all the kingdoms into which the <a id="l911"></a>Western Empire became divided at its first breaking. And <a id="l912"></a>if the kingdom of the Alans in Spain, by reason of its short con<a id="l913"></a>tinuance &amp; its uniting with the kingdom of the Vandals so as to <a id="l914"></a>be comprehended therein, be omitted; you will have the just number <a id="l915"></a>of ten kingdoms. Some of these at length fell &amp; new ones arose: <a id="l916"></a>but what ever was their number afterwards; they are still called <a id="l917"></a>the  ten kings from their first number. –<sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup></p>
<p id="par62">Now Daniel <em class="underline">considered the horns &amp; behold there came up among them <a id="l920"></a>another little horn before whom there were three of the first horns <a id="l921"></a>pluckt up by the roots, &amp; behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of </em><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p0020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">a man, &amp; a mouth speaking great things, &amp; its look was <a id="l922"></a>more stout then its  fellows, &amp; it made war with the Saints <a id="l923"></a>&amp; prevailed against them</em>. And one that stood by &amp; made  <a id="l924"></a>Daniel know the interpretation of these things told him that <a id="l925"></a><em class="underline">the ten horns were ten kings that should arise &amp; another [king] <a id="l926"></a>should arise after them &amp; be divers from the first</em> [kings] <em class="underline">&amp; <a id="l927"></a>subdue three kings &amp; speak great words against the most high <a id="l928"></a>&amp; weare out the saints &amp; think to change times &amp; laws &amp; that</em> <a id="l929"></a>[after he had subdued the three kings] <em class="underline">they should be given <a id="l930"></a>into his hands for a time times &amp; half a time</em>. This little <a id="l931"></a>horn in being numbred  amongst the other horns &amp; called a <a id="l932"></a>king, must be a little kingdom: For by horns &amp; kings Daniel <a id="l933"></a>understands kingdoms. But it was of a different kind from the <a id="l934"></a>other ten kingdoms having a life or soul peculiar to it self <a id="l935"></a>with eyes &amp; a mouth. By it eyes it was a Seer &amp; by its mouth <a id="l936"></a> speaking great things &amp;  <a id="l937"></a>changing times &amp; laws it was a Prophet as well as a king. And such <a id="l938"></a>a Seer a Prophet &amp; a King was the Church of Rome. This was a <a id="l939"></a>dominion very divers from all other dominions, &amp; the only do<a id="l940"></a>minion among the ten kingdoms to which the prophesy of this <a id="l941"></a>horn can be applied.</p>
<p id="par63">A Seer, Ἐπίσκοπος is a Bishop in the litteral sense of the <a id="l942"></a>word; &amp; this Church claims the universal Bishopric.</p>
<p id="par64">With his mouth he gives laws to kings &amp; nations as an Oracle <a id="l943"></a>&amp; pretends to infallibility &amp; that his dictates are binding to the whole <a id="l944"></a>world, which is to be a Prophet in the highest degree.</p>
<p id="par65">He claims a power of dispensing with Gods laws, of forgiving or <a id="l945"></a>retaining sins, of remitting or relaxing the pains of Purgatory &amp; Hell, <a id="l946"></a>of granting Indulgences, of canonizing  dead men to be <a id="l947"></a>worshipped with praise &amp; invocation, of changing a piece of bread into a <a id="l948"></a>God to be adored, of disposing of kingdoms by divine right, of absolving <a id="l949"></a>subjects from their oaths of allegiance, &amp; of depriving all his opposers <a id="l950"></a>of heaven by excommunications: all which is to be not only a Prophet <a id="l951"></a>&amp; a king but even a God upon earth. This is his mouth. This is his look <a id="l952"></a>more stout then his fellows. And he is the only dominion in the world <a id="l953"></a>who pretends to such an universal dictatorship, &amp; who speaks such <a id="l954"></a>great words against the most high. But let us see how he rose <a id="l955"></a>up after the ten kings &amp; subdued three of them.</p>
<p id="par66">The Franks were heathens till the reign of Clodovæus their king. <a id="l956"></a>He being converted to the Roman religion A.C. 496 subjected his king<a id="l957"></a>dom to the Pope, &amp;  Sigonius tells us that the Pope made <a id="l958"></a>Remigius Archbishop of Rhemes his deputy Bishop over France. This was <a id="l959"></a>the first considerable step gained by the Pope towards the universal <a id="l960"></a>bishopric over  the barbarous nations who had invaded the <a id="l961"></a>Empire. Then Clodovæus who having gained a great victory <a id="l962"></a>over the Goths, received from the Greek Emperor Anastasius a <a id="l963"></a>splendid crown adorned with gemms, besides other presents: &amp; having <a id="l964"></a>worn it one day for that victory A.C. 507, sent it seven years <a id="l965"></a>after, a present to the Pope, as more fit to adorn that august <a id="l966"></a>head then his own. This Crown, as Sigebert tells us, was afterwards <a id="l967"></a>called <em class="underline">Regnum</em>, the kingdom. And this was the first instance <a id="l968"></a>of the Popes wearing a temporal crown as Bishop of Rome <a id="l969"></a>For he had not yet a kingdom for which he should wear <a id="l970"></a>it, &amp; his Metropolis Rome with all Italy was under the domi<a id="l971"></a>nion of the Ostrogoths.</p>

And thus the right of the Roman <a id="l1279"></a>Emperors which had hitherto been in the Greek Emperors was by this <a id="l1280"></a>Act translated in the west to the kings of France.</p>
<p id="par88"><sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup>After these things Charles gave the City &amp; Dutchy of Rome to the <a id="l1282"></a>Pope subordinately to himself as Emperor of the Romans spent the winter in <a id="l1283"></a>ordering the affairs of Rome &amp; of the Apostolic Sea &amp; of all Italy, both <a id="l1284"></a>civil &amp; ecclesiastical, &amp; in making new laws for them, &amp; returned the <a id="l1285"></a>next summer into France, leaving the city under its Senate &amp; both <a id="l1286"></a>under the Pope &amp; himself. And hearing that his new laws were not <a id="l1287"></a>observed by the Iudges in dictating the law nor by the people in <a id="l1288"></a>hearing it, &amp; that the great men took servants from the free men &amp; from <a id="l1289"></a>the Churches &amp; Monasteries to labour in their vineyards fields pastures <a id="l1290"></a>&amp; houses, &amp; continued to exact cattel &amp; wine of them, &amp; to oppress <a id="l1291"></a>those that served the Churches: he wrote to his son Pipin to remedy <a id="l1292"></a>these abuses, take care of the Church &amp; see that his laws be <a id="l1293"></a>executed. It is observable also that the custome of kissing the Popes <a id="l1294"></a>feet began about this time. There are some instances of it in the <a id="l1295"></a>ninth Century. Platina tells us that the feet of Pope Leo IV <a id="l1296"></a>were kissed according to ancient custome by all that came to him, <a id="l1297"></a>&amp; some say that Leo III began this custome, pretending that <a id="l1298"></a>his hand was infected with the kiss of a woman. The Popes <a id="l1299"></a>began also about this time to canonize Saints &amp; grant Indulgences <a id="l1300"></a>&amp; pardons; &amp; some represent that Leo III was the first author <a id="l1301"></a>of all these things.</p>
<p id="par89">Now the Senate &amp; People of Rome I take to be the third <a id="l1302"></a>king whom the little horn overcame. For the old Roman Empire <a id="l1303"></a>was a king in the sense of Daniels prophesies, as well when it was <a id="l1304"></a>in the form of a common wealth under its Senate as when it was <a id="l1305"></a>reduced to a monarchical form of government under its Emperors. <a id="l1306"></a>This people elected the Pope &amp; the Emperor, &amp; by electing the <a id="l1307"></a>Emperor was acknowledged to be the remainder of the old Ro<a id="l1308"></a>man Empire &amp; by consequence a little Empire, the Empire of <a id="l1309"></a>the Romans in whose name the fourth Beast of Daniel still <a id="l1310"></a>continued, &amp; of which Charles the great was made Emperor. <a id="l1311"></a>Rome was to be the Metropolis of the little horn, &amp; therefore <a id="l1312"></a>its Dutchy was to be conquered by him. And the victory of the <a id="l1313"></a>little horn over this king was attended with greater consequences <a id="l1314"></a>then those over the other two kings, &amp; finished the work which <a id="l1315"></a>those victories began. For it set up the Western Empire which <a id="l1316"></a>continues to this day. It completed &amp; secured Peters patrimony <a id="l1317"></a>to the Pope; which Patrimony was the kingdom of the little horn. <a id="l1318"></a>It put him in possession of the city Rome the Metropolis of <a id="l1319"></a>his kingdom &amp; thereby began his reign in this city as a temporal <a id="l1320"></a>Prince. It set him up above the judicature of the Roman Senate <a id="l1321"></a>&amp; even above all humane judicature &amp; gave him the supremacy <a id="l1322"></a>over the western Churches &amp; their Councils in a high degree.  <a id="l1324"></a>It gave him a look more stout then his fellows so that at length <a id="l1325"></a>when this new religion was sufficiently established in the minds of <a id="l1326"></a>men he began to grapple with kings &amp; even with the Emperor him<a id="l1327"></a>self. Yet the Senate of Rome while it lasted gave him frequent <a id="l1328"></a>trouble for recovering her liberty.</p>


<p id="par92">The northern nations who had invaded the western Empire differed <a id="l1331"></a>from the Pope in religion  a long time, &amp;  were converted to his reli<a id="l1332"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span>ligion by degrees. All Germany differed from him in religion till they <a id="l1333"></a>were conquered by Charles the great. By those conquests, &amp; the <a id="l1334"></a>making of Charles Emperor they became a part of the body of <a id="l1335"></a>the Beast. The Woman might fly from the Temple of God into the <a id="l1336"></a>Wilderness of Arabia before those days &amp; continue her flight <a id="l1337"></a>through the Wilderness  towards the great city Babylon. <a id="l1338"></a>But before the conquest  of Germany,  &amp; the conversion of those northern <a id="l1340"></a>nations to her religion she did not begin to sit upon all the many <a id="l1341"></a>waters or nations which were to compose the body of her Beast. Before the <a id="l1342"></a>subjection of Rome she could not be said to arrive at her <a id="l1343"></a>place in the wilderness upon the many waters &amp; become the <a id="l1344"></a>great city Babylon. It was by the conquests of Charles the great <a id="l1345"></a>&amp; the conversion of the western nations to the Church of Rome <a id="l1346"></a>&amp; donation of tyths &amp; Peter-pence, &amp; the coronation of Charles Em<a id="l1347"></a>peror of  the Romans &amp; his coronation oath to maintain the <a id="l1348"></a>Church of Rome in her grandeur &amp; the victory of the Pope over the <a id="l1349"></a>Greeks the Lombards &amp; the city &amp; Duchy of Rome: it was, I say, by these <a id="l1350"></a>things that the Woman arrived at her place in the Wilderness upon the <a id="l1351"></a>many waters &amp; began to sit upon her Beast &amp; upon the seven hills &amp; reign at Babylon over <a id="l1352"></a>the kings of the earth, &amp; to be cloathed in fine linnen &amp; purple &amp; <a id="l1353"></a>scarlet &amp; decked with gold &amp; pretious stones &amp; pearles, to be fed <a id="l1354"></a>&amp; nourished in her place &amp; fare deliciously with the kings of the earth. <a id="l1355"></a>&amp; that she &amp; her Beast began to act in conjunction with one another. <a id="l1356"></a>And now the Woman having subdued the city where she was to reign <a id="l1357"></a>&amp; being arrived at her place of dominion over this city &amp; over the <a id="l1358"></a>kings of the earth: this little female horn has reigned ever since <a id="l1359"></a>with a peculiar soul &amp; a look more stout then her fellows; &amp; by <a id="l1360"></a>establishing the worship of Images, canonizing Saints to be invoked, <a id="l1361"></a>granting Indulgencies &amp; Pardons, absolving men from vows &amp; oaths, <a id="l1362"></a>ascribing vertues &amp; powers to things consecrated, introducing &amp; establishing <a id="l1363"></a>the doctrine of transubstantiation &amp; the adoration of consecrated <a id="l1364"></a>wafers, &amp; by decreeing what laws &amp; doctrines she thinks fit &amp; imposing <a id="l1365"></a>her Decrees as Apostolic infallible &amp; of divine authority she has been <a id="l1366"></a>changing times &amp; laws &amp; they have ever since her rising up &amp; con<a id="l1367"></a>quering the three kings been given into her hands, &amp; by her great <a id="l1368"></a>power she has been able ever since  to make war with the saints &amp; weare <a id="l1369"></a>them out &amp; to become drunken with their blood.</p>
<p id="par93">When the Pope in favour of the worship of images revolted <a id="l1370"></a>from the Greek Emperor, &amp; began to set up for himself, in rising <a id="l1371"></a>up he overcame the three kings who stood in his way &amp; opposed him <a id="l1372"></a>&amp; by overcoming them he rose up &amp; acquired a temporal kingdom <a id="l1373"></a>composed of the three conquests &amp; thereby became a horn of the <a id="l1374"></a>Beast. And in token that he is a king as well as bishop he <a id="l1375"></a>wears the crowns of three kingdoms upon his head in form of a <a id="l1376"></a>triple crown &amp; carries the keys of the cities of the two first <a id="l1377"></a>kingdoms in his hand. His kingdom they call Peters patrimony <a id="l1378"></a>because given by Pipin &amp; Charles the great to S<sup>t</sup> Peter. And <a id="l1379"></a>for the same reason the keys of the cities of his kingdom they <a id="l1380"></a>call S<sup>t</sup> Peter's keys, they being offered to S<sup>t</sup> Peter upon his Con<a id="l1381"></a>fession or altar. But some turning history into an allegory tell <a id="l1382"></a>us that the keys represent the power of binding &amp; loosing, &amp; are <a id="l1383"></a>the keys of heaven, &amp; that the three crowns relate to heaven <a id="l1384"></a>earth &amp; hell, as if the Pope was crowned king of those three regi<a id="l1385"></a>ons. These are whimsies which I need not stay to confute. Others <a id="l1386"></a>come nearer to the truth who tell us that the crowns denote <a id="l1387"></a>the Pontificial Imperial &amp; Royal power of the Pope. One of <a id="l1388"></a>his crowns was given him by Clodovæus king of the Franks as <a id="l1389"></a>above. This Crown has no relation to the Exarchate or kingdom <a id="l1390"></a>of Lombardy. It was given him as Pope of Rome: &amp; after his <a id="l1391"></a>subduing that city he deserved to weare it as its king. The other <a id="l1392"></a>two crowns came to him with the two golden keys upon the conquest <a id="l1393"></a>of the Imperial Exarchate &amp; the kingdom of Lombardy, tho it was <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027r"> &lt;27r&gt; </span> some time before he began to weare them.</p>
<p id="par94">In a small book printed at Paris 1689, &amp; entituled, <sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup> <em class="underline">An histo<a id="l1397"></a>rical dissertation upon some coynes of Charles the great, Ludo<a id="l1398"></a>vicus Pius, Lotharius &amp; their successors stamped at Rome</em>, there <a id="l1399"></a>is a draught of a piece of Mosaic work which Pope Leo the <a id="l1400"></a>third caused to be made in his Palace neare the Church of <a id="l1401"></a>Iohn Lateran, in memory of his sending the standard or banner <a id="l1402"></a>of the city of Rome curiously wrought to Charles the great <a id="l1403"></a>&amp; which still remained there at the publishing of the said <a id="l1404"></a>book.

The three keys in the <a id="l1413"></a>lap of Peter signify the keys of the three parts of his Patri<a id="l1414"></a>mony, viz<sup>t</sup> of Rome with its Dutchy, of Ravenna with the <a id="l1415"></a>Exarchate &amp; of the territories taken from the Lombards.

The  Salian Franks rose up in arms the <a id="l1561"></a>next year, &amp; the Britains separated from the Emperor  the year <a id="l1562"></a>following. All these ten kingdoms therefore arose within the short <a id="l1563"></a>reign of Arcadius &amp; Honorius.

<p id="par106"> Of these ten kingdoms I see not which can be excepted <a id="l1602"></a>for they were all at some time or other very potent &amp; <a id="l1603"></a>the shortest of above 110 years continuance except the Alan <a id="l1604"></a>kingdom in Spain: for the shortness of which there is this <a id="l1605"></a>double recompence that while it stood it was more potent <a id="l1606"></a>then the Vandalic &amp; Suevian kingdoms <em class="underline">ijsque potentebatur</em> as <a id="l1607"></a>Isidorus speaks, &amp; that when it fell the people were not dissi<a id="l1608"></a>pated but kept their seat there as the name thereof Cata<a id="l1609"></a>launia derived from them still  testifies &amp; consequently <a id="l1610"></a>they remained still a horn. For having been once a horn they <a id="l1611"></a> may be accounted one so long as the people endures notwith<a id="l1612"></a>standing that their dominion be taken away, as is plain out <a id="l1613"></a>of Daniel's vision of the Ram &amp; Goat where the Ram is re<a id="l1614"></a>presented with both of his horns till the Goat breaks them, and <a id="l1615"></a>yet the dominion of the first horn was taken away by the <a id="l1616"></a>second above 200 years before.</p>
<p id="par107">The shortness of this kingdom made me  look about <a id="l1617"></a>for another kingdom .

In the <a id="l1656"></a>reign of Martian the Emperor, that is, between the years 450 &amp; 456 <a id="l1657"></a>the Saxons under Hengist &amp; Horsa were called in by the Britains <a id="l1658"></a>&amp; assisted them for a while, but six years after revolted &amp; made <a id="l1659"></a>war upon them.

<h2 id="hd3" class="cent">Chap. VI. <a id="l1730"></a><br>Of the Empire of the Latines.</h2>
<p id="par114">The Romans were at first a small kingdome of Italy &amp; <a id="l1731"></a>began to make a figure in the world about the time that in con<a id="l1732"></a>junction with the king of Pergamus they took from Antiochus <a id="l1733"></a>magnus all Asia on this side the mountain Taurus, &amp; to grow <a id="l1734"></a>great from the time that by the assistance of the   Achæans they conquered Macedon. For after <a id="l1735"></a>the conquest of Macedon they conquered Carthage &amp;  then united with the kingdom of Pergamus, inheriting it with all Asia on this side the mountain Taurus <a id="l1737"></a>by the last Will &amp; Testament of Attalus the last king   thereof. And by this union the kingdom of Perga<a id="l1738"></a>mus grew mighty, but not in its own power. For this united dominion of the Greeks &amp; Latines gradually <a id="l1739"></a>extended its  power over Spain, Dalmatia, Syria, Gallia, Egypt, Britain, the Achæans or Greeks &amp; <a id="l1740"></a> Dacia &amp; reigned over all these countries untill the revolt <a id="l1741"></a>of Dacia, &amp; the separation of the Empire of the Greeks from <a id="l1742"></a>that of the Latines: the particular history of all which is <a id="l1743"></a>every where to be met with.</p>
<p id="par115">Dacia was a large country bounded on the south by the <a id="l1744"></a>Danube, on the east by the Euxine sea, on the north by the <a id="l1745"></a>river Neister &amp; the mountain Crapack, &amp; on the west by the <a id="l1746"></a>Tibesis or Teys which runs southward into the Danube a little <a id="l1747"></a>above Belgrade, &amp; comprehended the countries now called Tran<a id="l1748"></a>sylvania Moldavia &amp; Wallachia &amp; the eastern part of the <a id="l1749"></a>upper Hungary. Its ancient inhabitants were called Getæ by <a id="l1750"></a>the Greeks &amp; Daci by the Latines &amp; Goths by themselves. Alex<a id="l1751"></a>ander the great attaqued them &amp; Trajan conquered them &amp; redu<a id="l1752"></a>ced their country into a Province of the Roman Empire, &amp; thereby <a id="l1753"></a>the propagation of the Christian religion amongst them was much <a id="l1754"></a>promoted. They were composed of several Gothic nations called <a id="l1755"></a>Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Vandals, Gepides, Lombards, Burgundians &amp;c <a id="l1756"></a>all which came originally from the southern parts of Scanzia <a id="l1757"></a>or Scandinavia, that great Peninsula in the Baltic sea con<a id="l1758"></a>teining Norway &amp; most of Sueden, &amp; reputed an Island by the <a id="l1759"></a>ancients. Whence it came to pass that they all agreed in <a id="l1760"></a>their manners &amp; spake the same language as Procopius <a id="l1761"></a>represents. Paulus Diaconus in his Historia Miscella, Lib. XIV, <a id="l1762"></a>speaking of the times next after the death of Theodosius the <a id="l1763"></a>great tells us: Eodem tempore erant Gothi et aliæ Gentes <a id="l1764"></a>maximæ trans Danubium habitantes: ex quibus rationabiliores <a id="l1765"></a>quatuor sunt, Gothi scilicet, Huisogothi, Gepides &amp; Vandali, <a id="l1766"></a>et nomen tantum et nihil aliud mutantes. Omnes autem <a id="l1767"></a>fidei erant Arianæ malignitatis. Isti sub Arcadio et Honorio <a id="l1768"></a>Danubium transeuntes locati sunt in terra Romanorum; et Ge<a id="l1769"></a>pides quidem (ex quibus postea divisi sunt Langobardi et Avares) <a id="l1770"></a>villas quæ sunt circa Sengidonum et Sirmium habitavere. And <a id="l1771"></a>Procopius in the beginning of his Historia Vandalica writes to the <a id="l1772"></a>same purpose.</p>
<p id="par116">Before these nations revolted the Goths or Ostrogoths were <a id="l1773"></a>seated in the eastern parts of Dacia; the Vandals in the western <a id="l1774"></a>part upon the river Teys where the rivers Maresh &amp; Keresh run <a id="l1775"></a>into it. The Visigoths were between them. The Gepides were (accord<a id="l1776"></a>ing to Iornandes) upon the Vistula. The Burgundians (a Vandalic <a id="l1777"></a>nation) were between the Vistula &amp; the southern fountain of the <a id="l1778"></a>Boristhenes at some distance from the mountain Crapac northwards <a id="l1779"></a>where Ptolomy places them by the names of Phrugundiones &amp; Bur<a id="l1780"></a>giones. The Alans (another <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n28-ref">[28]</sup> Gothic nation) were between the <a id="l1782"></a>northern fountain of the Boristhenes &amp; the mouth of the river Tanais <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p034r"> &lt;34r&gt; </span> where Ptolomy places the mountain Alanus. The Roxolani were on the <a id="l1783"></a>southern coast of the Alans, &amp; western side of the Palus Mœotis.</p>
<p id="par117">In the second year of the reign of the Emperor Philip, the Goths <a id="l1784"></a>for want of their pay began to revolt from the Romans, &amp; under the <a id="l1785"></a>conduct of their king Ostrogotha the grandson of Amala, being <a id="l1786"></a>assisted by the Thaphili &amp; Astringi or Vandals &amp; the Cappi (other <a id="l1787"></a>Gothic nations) made war upon them. And the Gepides under their <a id="l1788"></a>king Fastida routed the Burgundians with a great slaughter, &amp; conquered <a id="l1789"></a>some other nations, &amp; then invaded the said Goths &amp; were routed by them. <a id="l1790"></a>Cniva (called Echina by Pomponius Lætus) succeeded Ostrogotha in the <a id="l1791"></a>reign of Decius &amp; routed the Roman army &amp; slew Decius, &amp; the next <a id="l1792"></a>year invaded Greece Macedon, Pontus, Asia, &amp; Illyricum, &amp; kept <a id="l1793"></a>Macedon &amp; Illyricum almost fifteen years; &amp; then the Goths <a id="l1794"></a>invading the Empire (as Trebellius Pollio tells us) with an army of <a id="l1795"></a>three hundred &amp; twenty thousand Scythians composed of the Peuceni <a id="l1796"></a>Grutungi, Ostrogoths, Vitringi, Gepides, Heruli; &amp;c, &amp; being beated in <a id="l1797"></a>Mœsia &amp; other places by the Emperor Claudius, returned to their <a id="l1798"></a>seats beyond the Danube. And then the Emperor Aurelian (as <a id="l1799"></a>Vopiscus informs us) cum vastatum Illyricum &amp; Mœsiam deperditam <a id="l1800"></a>videret, Provinciam trans Danubium Daciam a Trajano constitutam, <a id="l1801"></a>sublato exercitu &amp; Provincialibus, reliquit, desperans eam posse <a id="l1802"></a>retineri: abductosque ex ea populos in Mœsia collocavit, appella<a id="l1803"></a>vitque suam Daciam. This was about the year of Christ 272</p>
<p id="par118">But the Church of Dacia still continued united to the Church <a id="l1804"></a>of the Roman Empire. For Theophilus Bishop or Patriarch of <a id="l1805"></a>Dacia was at the Council of Nice A.C. 325, &amp; his successor <a id="l1806"></a>Vlphilas was at the Council of Constantinople A.C. 360.</p>
<p id="par119">Dioclesian in the year 286 divided the Roman Empire <a id="l1807"></a>between himself &amp; Maximianus, retaining the government <a id="l1808"></a>of the eastern nations to himself, &amp; leaving that of the western <a id="l1809"></a>to Maximianus. And by this Act &amp; the separation of the Goths, <a id="l1810"></a>the Roman Empire began to be divided into the three parts touched <a id="l1811"></a>upon in the Apocalyps, the Eastern Empire, the Western Em<a id="l1812"></a>pire, &amp; the Empire of the Goths. For Dacia was large &amp; valiant <a id="l1813"></a>&amp; the Goths soon grew into an Empire almost as large as either of <a id="l1814"></a>the other two, &amp; the Churches of all three under several Patri<a id="l1815"></a>archs were united in communion, as one Church Catholick, &amp; <a id="l1816"></a>continued so united till the fall of the Gothic Empire. </p>
<p id="par120">Constantine the great built Constantinople A.C. 330, &amp; made it <a id="l1818"></a>the Metropolis of the eastern Provinces of the Roman Empire, &amp; Rome <a id="l1819"></a>the Metropolis of the western; both cities being governed after one <a id="l1820"></a>&amp; the same manner by a Senate &amp; Consuls. And by this Act he <a id="l1821"></a>established the division. He left the Empire between his sons A.C. <a id="l1822"></a>337 &amp; his son Constantius reunited it under himself A.C. 353, &amp; <a id="l1823"></a>Valentinian divided it between himself &amp; his brother Valens A.C. 364 <a id="l1824"></a>&amp; after the death of Valens it was reunited under Gratian the son <a id="l1825"></a>of Valentinian A.C. 378. But after five months Gratian made <a id="l1826"></a>Theodosius Emperor of the East in the room of Valens 16 Ian. A.<a id="l1827"></a>C. 379, &amp; Theodosius left the Empire divided between his sons Arca<a id="l1828"></a>dius &amp; Honorius A.C. 395; after which it was no more united.</p>
<p id="par121">The eastern Empire (called also the Greek Empire) continued <a id="l1829"></a>entire about 240 years &amp; then lost Syria &amp; Egypt to the Saracens <a id="l1830"></a>but yet stood above 800 years longer before it came into the hands of <a id="l1831"></a>the Turks. This Empire is represented in Daniel by the He-goat <a id="l1832"></a>&amp; in the Apocalyps by the great red Dragon. The western Empire or <a id="l1833"></a>empire of the Latines is represented by the Beast with ten horns &amp; by <a id="l1834"></a>the little horn of the He-goat. It became a horn of the He-goat by <a id="l1835"></a>inheriting the kingdom of Pergamus in Asia minor by the Legacy <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p035r"> &lt;35r&gt; </span> of Attalus. It had seven successive heads which were common to <a id="l1836"></a>it self &amp; the Dragon, &amp; answered to the times of the seven seals; <a id="l1837"></a>but its heads were without crowns, &amp; the Dragons heads were <a id="l1838"></a>crowned because the Dragon reigned first &amp; included the Beast in his <a id="l1839"></a>mystical body untill he gave the Beast his throne. It was wounded <a id="l1840"></a>to death with a sword in the reign of Constantius. It revived &amp; its <a id="l1841"></a>deadly wound was healed by a new division of the Empire in the <a id="l1842"></a>beginning of the reign of Valentinian &amp; Valens. It rose out of the <a id="l1843"></a>sea at the division of the Empire between Gratian &amp; Theodosius <a id="l1844"></a>&amp; at its rise appeared with a wound which was made &amp; healed <a id="l1845"></a>in one of its heads before it rose, viz<sup>t</sup> in the head which was <a id="l1846"></a>when five were fallen, that is, in the sixt head. At its rise out <a id="l1847"></a>of the sea the seventh seal was opened, &amp; the reign of the seventh <a id="l1848"></a>head began. And at the division of the Empire between the sons of <a id="l1849"></a>Theodosius, the Dragon gave the Beast his power &amp; throne &amp; great <a id="l1850"></a>authority.  And thereby the Beast became the eighth head, &amp; yet <a id="l1851"></a>was of the seven, being a part of the seventh. And on this <a id="l1852"></a>eighth head are ten horns, all of them crowned, but on the <a id="l1853"></a>Dragon's heads they are without crowns. They were therefore <a id="l1854"></a>to rise out of the nations which were within the Dragons body <a id="l1855"></a>but grew not into kingdoms before the reign of the eighth <a id="l1856"></a>head. For they received power as kings at or about the same <a id="l1857"></a>time with the Beast, that is, when the Dragon gave the Beast his <a id="l1858"></a>power &amp; throne, or presently after. And that we may know what <a id="l1859"></a>kingdoms they were &amp; how they rose, we must have recourse to the <a id="l1860"></a>history of the kingdom of Dacia.</p>
<p id="par122">Cniva king of the Goths was succeeded by Araricus in the <a id="l1861"></a>reign of Dioclesian, &amp; Araricus by Geberic in the reign of Con<a id="l1862"></a>stantine the great. Geberic made war upon the Sarmatans between <a id="l1863"></a>Dacia &amp; Moravia: &amp; the servants of the Sarmatans being armed <a id="l1864"></a>by their masters against the Goths revolted &amp; made their Mas<a id="l1865"></a>ters fly into the Roman Empire where Constantine the great <a id="l1866"></a>granted them seats. This was done, according to Eusebius, Ann. <a id="l1867"></a>Olymp. 278. 2, A.C. 334. Geberic conquered also the Vandals, <a id="l1868"></a>slew their king Wisumar &amp; made them fly over the Danube <a id="l1869"></a>into Pannonia where Constantine granted them seats. The kings <a id="l1870"></a>of these Vandals according to Iornandes were of the Aedingi or <a id="l1871"></a>Astingi a Vandalic nation which (according to Dio) came into Dacia in <a id="l1872"></a>the reign of Marcus Antonius. They staid quietly in Pannonia <a id="l1873"></a>under the dominion of the Romans about forty years, that is untill <a id="l1874"></a>the other Gothic nations flying from the Hunns, came over the <a id="l1875"></a>Danube &amp; began to disturbe the Empire.</p>
<p id="par123">Hermaneric succeeded Geberic, &amp; conquered the Heruli, <a id="l1876"></a>Veneti, Antes &amp; Sclavi &amp; many other warlike nations of Scy<a id="l1877"></a>thia &amp; Germany, as Iornandes informs us, &amp; particularly the <a id="l1878"></a>nations which Iornandes calls the Thuidi Visinambrocæ, Mœ<a id="l1879"></a>rens, Mordensimnis, Caris, Rocæ, Tadzans, Athual, Navigo, <a id="l1880"></a>Bubegentæ, &amp; Coldæ, &amp; the Æstri or Estij a people seated upon <a id="l1881"></a>the sinus Finnicus, &amp; the Roxolani on the Palus Mœotis, &amp; the <a id="l1882"></a>Quades &amp; Marcomans two German nations seated by Ptolomy <a id="l1883"></a>in Bohemia. Thus the kingdome of the Goths by successive conquests <a id="l1884"></a>grew into a large &amp; potent Empire composed of many northern <a id="l1885"></a>nations, &amp; seems in the reign of Hermaneric to have extended <a id="l1886"></a>eastward to the side of the Euxine sea the Lake Mœotis &amp; the <a id="l1887"></a>river Tanais; northward to the Sinus Finnicus where Revel &amp; Narva <a id="l1888"></a>are seated, &amp; to the fountains of the river Volga where the <a id="l1889"></a>city Moseo stands; &amp; westward to the rivers Oder &amp; Moraw &amp; the <a id="l1890"></a>fountains of the Elbe, so as to comprehend Silesia Moravia &amp; part <a id="l1891"></a>of Bohemia. And in this state it continued till the death of Hermane<a id="l1892"></a>rick which was in the year 376 or the year before. And from <a id="l1893"></a>these conquests, saith Iornandes, some have compared this king to <a id="l1894"></a>Alexander the great.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p036r"> &lt;36r&gt; </span>
<p id="par124">This king lived very long &amp; just before his death heard <a id="l1895"></a>of a great army of Hunns coming over the Lake Mœotis <a id="l1896"></a>&amp; beginning to invade him; &amp; then he left his kingdom divided <a id="l1897"></a>among many successors, Hunnimund, Fridigern, Vithimar, Atha<a id="l1898"></a>naric, Box, &amp; others. Hunnimund was his son &amp; reigned over the <a id="l1899"></a>eastern part of the Goths called Ostrogoths, &amp; Fridigern reigned <a id="l1900"></a>over the western part called Visigoths. For the Goths became <a id="l1901"></a>now divided into two bodies called by these names. Vithimar <a id="l1902"></a>or Winitharius was the son of Valeravan &amp; grandson of Athaulphus <a id="l1903"></a>or Vuldulph the brother of Hermaneric &amp; reigned over a part of <a id="l1904"></a>the Goths called Gruthungi by Ammian Marcelline, Gothunni by <a id="l1905"></a>Claudian, &amp; Sarmatǽ &amp; Scythians by others. Athanaric reigned over <a id="l1906"></a>another part of the Goths in Dacia called Thervingi, &amp; Box over the <a id="l1907"></a>Antes in Sarmatia; &amp; the Gepides had also their king. These kings <a id="l1908"></a>or some of them, seem to have been rectors of Provinces in the <a id="l1909"></a>life time of Hermaneric, &amp; to have kept their governments <a id="l1910"></a>after his death. For Athanaric (according to Isidorus) began his <a id="l1911"></a>reign in the fift year of the Emperor Valens &amp; by consequens <a id="l1912"></a>before the death of Hermaneric.</p>
<p id="par125">The Goths &amp; other Scythian nations beyond the Danube <a id="l1913"></a>had hitherto lived without letters, &amp; the Christian religion had <a id="l1914"></a>been hitherto propagated among them only by oral tradition. <a id="l1915"></a>But now Vlphilas the Patriarch of Dacia invented the Gothic <a id="l1916"></a>Letters &amp; translated the scriptures into the language of Dacia, <a id="l1917"></a>&amp; propagated the Christian religion very much among the Goths <a id="l1918"></a>&amp; Gepides, so that Fridigern king of the Visigoths became a Christian, <a id="l1919"></a>&amp; Athanaric fearing that the Christian religion should also prevail <a id="l1920"></a>in his kingdom (for the Thervingi were a branch of the Visigoths &amp; <a id="l1921"></a>Vlphilas instructed the people of both kingdoms) raised a vehement <a id="l1922"></a>persecution against the Christians in his kingdom &amp; put many of them <a id="l1923"></a>to death.</p>
<p id="par126">In the mean time the Hunns advancing under the conduct of <a id="l1924"></a>their king Balamber or Balamir invaded the Alans &amp; other nations <a id="l1925"></a>between the Tanais &amp; Dacia &amp; after the death of Hermaneric <a id="l1926"></a>entred Dacia &amp; made the people either submit or fly. The Ostrogoths <a id="l1927"></a>submitted, but the Gruthungi made some resistance, their King <a id="l1928"></a>Winitharius having strengthned himself by conquering the Antes <a id="l1929"></a>the year before the Hunns invaded thim. He beat the Hunns <a id="l1930"></a>in one or two battels, but was slain by Balamir in the third battel <a id="l1931"></a>&amp; his kingdom was given by the conqueror to Hunnimund. For <a id="l1932"></a>Sigismund the son of Hunnimund had assisted the Hunns in this <a id="l1933"></a>war with an army of Ostrogoths. After this, the Hunns pursued <a id="l1934"></a>Athanaric; &amp; the greatest part of his people deserting him fled <a id="l1935"></a>with some other Goths to the side of the Danube under the conduct <a id="l1936"></a>of Alavivus. Fridigern also fled thither with his people the Visigoths. <a id="l1937"></a>And these nations sent an embassy to the Emperor Valens, &amp; ob<a id="l1938"></a>teined leave to pass the Danube &amp; seat themselves in Mœsia &amp; <a id="l1939"></a>Thrace. Their Patriarch Vlphilas was at the head of this Embassy. <a id="l1940"></a>And presently after this, a great part of the Gruthungi under <a id="l1941"></a>the conduct of Alatheus &amp; Saphrax (the Guardians of Videric <a id="l1942"></a>the young son of Winitharius, now their king,) flying from the <a id="l1943"></a>Hunns &amp; Ostrogoths, came to the side of the Danube &amp; made <a id="l1944"></a>the same petition, but were rejected. Yet they passed the Danube <a id="l1945"></a>soon after without leave, while the Roman army was deteined <a id="l1946"></a>in Rhoætia in a war against the Alemans &amp; Sueves. This rout <a id="l1947"></a>was in the year 377.</p>
<p id="par127">These Goths being thus seated in the Empire, were soon <a id="l1948"></a>pressed with famin &amp; grosly abused by the Roman Governours <a id="l1949"></a>who sold them doggs flesh &amp; other carrion at high rates, and <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p037r"> &lt;37r&gt; </span> otherwise provoked them. Whereupon they took up arms <a id="l1950"></a>invaded Thrace, called in to their assistance some Goths <a id="l1951"></a>Alans &amp; Hunns from beyond the Danube, routed the <a id="l1952"></a>Roman army, slew the Emperor Valens, &amp; spread them<a id="l1953"></a>selves into Greece &amp; Pannonia as far as the Alps, Alatheus <a id="l1954"></a>&amp; Saphrax going westward. This was in the year 378. <a id="l1955"></a>But in the years 379 &amp; 380 they were checkt by the arms <a id="l1956"></a>of the Emperors Gratian &amp; Theodosius, &amp; made a submissive <a id="l1957"></a>peace, &amp; the Visigoths &amp; Thervingi returned to their <a id="l1958"></a>seats in Mœsia &amp; Thrace, the Hunns retired over <a id="l1959"></a>the Danube, &amp; the Alans &amp; Gruthungi obteined seats in <a id="l1960"></a>Pannonia.</p>
<p id="par128">During this war Athanaric king of the Thervingi came <a id="l1961"></a>over the Danube &amp; in autumn 1680, made the Emperor Theodosius <a id="l1962"></a>a visit at Constantinople, was honourably received, died in Ianuary <a id="l1963"></a>following, &amp; was splendidly interred. And his people seing this treatment <a id="l1964"></a>subjected themselves immediately to the Emperor without chusing <a id="l1965"></a>another king. But Fridigern king of the Visigoths was succeeded <a id="l1966"></a>by Alaric, &amp; Videric king of the Gruthungi by Radagaisus.</p>
<p id="par129">In the reign of Hermaneric or before the Lombards came out of <a id="l1967"></a>Scandinavia under the conduct of Ibor &amp; Ayon to seek new seats. <a id="l1968"></a>They were then called Winuli, but afterwards from their long <a id="l1969"></a>beards had the name of Langobards given them. When the Gothic <a id="l1970"></a>nations fled from the Hunns &amp; came in great numbers into the <a id="l1971"></a>Roman Empire, the Lombards came also over the Danube under the <a id="l1972"></a>conduct of the same captains &amp; beat the Vandals then seated in Pannonia, <a id="l1973"></a>&amp; remained in Pannonia many years. The Vandals retired westward, <a id="l1974"></a>&amp; the Emperor Gratian went into Gallia against them &amp; the Alemans <a id="l1975"></a>together, &amp; the Vandals thereupon went back into Pannonia. <a id="l1976"></a>This was when the Emperor Theodosius lay sick at Thessalonica <a id="l1977"></a>A.C. 379. And accordingly Prosper places the victory of the <a id="l1978"></a>Lombards over the Vandals in the consulship of Ausonius and <a id="l1979"></a>Olybrius, which fell upon this year.</p>
<p id="par130">About the year 373 or 374 the Burgundians rose from their <a id="l1980"></a>seats upon the Vistula with an army of eighty thousand men to <a id="l1981"></a>invade Gallia, &amp; being opposed seated themselves on the further <a id="l1982"></a>side of the Rhene above Mentz. And in the year 358 a body of <a id="l1983"></a>the Salian Franks with their king were received into the Empire <a id="l1984"></a>by the Emperor Iulian &amp; seated in Gallia between Brabant &amp; the <a id="l1985"></a>Rhene. And their king Mellobaudes was made Comes Domesticorum by the <a id="l1986"></a>Emperor Gratian. And Richomer another noble Frank was made Comes <a id="l1987"></a>Domesticorum &amp; Magister utriusque militiæ by Theodosius, &amp; A.C. 384 was Consul <a id="l1988"></a>with Clearchus. He was a great favorite of Theodosius &amp; accompanied <a id="l1989"></a>him in his war against Eugenius, but died in the expedition, &amp; left a <a id="l1990"></a>son called Theudemir, who afterwards became king of the Salian <a id="l1991"></a>Franks. In the time of this war some Franks from beyond the Rhene invaded Gallia under <a id="l1992"></a>the conduct of Genobell Marcomir &amp; Suno, but were repulsed by Stilico, &amp; Marcomir being slain was succeeded in Ger<a id="l1993"></a>many by his son <a id="l1994"></a>Pharamund.</p>
<p id="par131">And this was the state of things till Theodosius left the Empire <a id="l1995"></a>divided between his sons, &amp; thereby the Dragon retired into the eastern Empire &amp; the Beast which was the eighth <a id="l1996"></a>head &amp; of the seven received the Dragon's power &amp; throne in the west. And <a id="l1997"></a>then his ten horns took up arms &amp; received power as kings in the <a id="l1998"></a>following manner.</p>
<p id="par132">After the death of the Emperor Theodosius the Visigoths under the <a id="l1999"></a>conduct of Alaric, now their king, rose from their seats in Thrace &amp; <a id="l2000"></a>wasted Macedon, Thessaly, Achaia, Peloponnesus, &amp; Epire with fire <a id="l2001"></a>&amp; sword five years together, &amp; then turning westward invaded Dal<a id="l2002"></a>matia, Illyricum &amp; Pannonia, &amp; from thence went into Italy A.C. <a id="l2003"></a>402, &amp; the next year was so beaten at Pollentia &amp; Verona by Sti<a id="l2004"></a>lico the commander of the forces of the western Empire, that <a id="l2005"></a>Claudian calls the remainder of the forces of Alaric <em class="underline">tanta ex gente <a id="l2006"></a>reliquias breves,</em> &amp; Prudentius <em class="underline">gentem deletam</em>. Thereupon Alaric <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p038r"> &lt;38r&gt; </span> made peace with the Emperor, being so far humbled that Orosius <a id="l2007"></a>tells us he did <em class="underline">pro pace optima et quibuscunque sedibus suppliciter <a id="l2008"></a>&amp; simpliciter orare</em>. This peace <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n29-ref">[29]</sup> was ratified by mutual hostages <a id="l2011"></a>&amp; Ætius was sent hostage to Alaric, &amp; therefore Alaric continued a free <a id="l2012"></a>Prince in the seats now granted to him.</p>
<p id="par133">When Alaric took up arms, the nations beyond the Danube <a id="l2013"></a>began to be in motion, &amp; the next winter (the winter between <a id="l2014"></a>A.C. 395 &amp; A.C. 396) a great body of Hunns, Alans, Ostrogoths &amp; <a id="l2015"></a>other northern nations came over the frozen Danube being invited <a id="l2016"></a>by Ruffin; &amp; their brethren also who had obteined seats within the <a id="l2017"></a>Empire, took up arms. Ierome calls all this great multitude Hunns, <a id="l2018"></a>Alans, Vandals, Goths, Sarmatans, Quades, &amp; Marcomans, &amp; saith that they <a id="l2019"></a>invaded all places between Constantinople &amp; the Iulian alps, wasting <a id="l2020"></a>Scythia, Thrace, Macedon, Dardania, Dacia, Thessaly, Achaia, Epire, Dal<a id="l2021"></a>matia &amp; all Pannonia. And the Suevians also invaded Rhætia. For <a id="l2022"></a>when Alaric ravaged Pannonia the Romans were defending Rhætia <a id="l2023"></a>which gave Alaric an opportunity of invading Italy as Claudian <a id="l2024"></a>thus mentions</p>
<div class="lg">
<p class="l">Non nisi perfidia nacti penetrabile tempus</p>
<p class="l">Irrupere Getæ, nostras dum Rhætia vires</p>
<p class="l">Occupat, atque alio desudant Marte cohortes.</p>
</div>
<p id="par134" class="i0">And when Alaric went from those parts into Italy, some other barba<a id="l2025"></a>rous nations invaded Noricum &amp; Vindelicia, as the same Poet Claudian <a id="l2026"></a>thus mentions</p>
<div class="lg">
<p class="l15">Iam fœdera gentes</p>
<p class="l">Exuerant, Latijque audita clade feroces</p>
<p class="l">Vendelicos saltus &amp; Norica rura tenebant.</p>
</div>
<p id="par135" class="i0">This was in the years 402 &amp; 403. And among these nations I reccon <a id="l2027"></a>the Suevians Quades &amp; Marcomans. For they were all in arms <a id="l2028"></a>at this time, &amp; the Quades &amp; Marcomans were Suevian nations <a id="l2029"></a>&amp; they &amp; the Suevians came originally from Bohemia &amp; the river <a id="l2030"></a>Suevus or Sprahe in Lusatia sometimes subject to the Goths under <a id="l2031"></a>Hermaneric, &amp; were now united under one common king called <a id="l2032"></a>Ermeric, who soon after led them into Gallia. The Vandals and <a id="l2033"></a>Alans might also about this time extend themselves into Noricum. <a id="l2034"></a>Also Vldin with a new great body of Hunns passed the Danube about <a id="l2035"></a>the time of Chrysostoms banishment, that is A.C. 404 &amp; wasted Thrace &amp; Mœsia. <a id="l2036"></a>And Radagaisus king of the Gruthungi &amp; successor of Winithar inviting over more barbarians <a id="l2037"></a>from beyond the Danube invaded Italy with an army of above two <a id="l2038"></a>hundred thousand Goths, &amp; the next year, A.C. 405 or 406) was <a id="l2039"></a>overcome by Stilico &amp; perished with his army. In this war Stilico was <a id="l2040"></a>assisted by a great body of Hunns &amp; Ostrogoths under the conduct of <a id="l2041"></a>Vldin &amp; Sarus. They were hired by the Emperor Honorius. And in <a id="l2042"></a>all this confusion it was necessary for the Lombards in Pannonia <a id="l2043"></a>to arm themselves in their own defense &amp; assert their liberty <a id="l2044"></a>the Romans being no longer able to protect them.</p>
<p id="par136">And now Stilico purposing to make himself Emperor <a id="l2045"></a>procured a military Præfecture for Alaric, &amp; sent him into <a id="l2046"></a>the east in the service of Honorius the Western Emperor committ<a id="l2047"></a>ing some Roman troops to his conduct to strengthen his army of Goths <a id="l2048"></a>&amp; promising to follow soon after with his own army. His pretence <a id="l2049"></a>was to recover some regions of Illyricum which the Eastern Emperor <a id="l2050"></a>was accused to detein injuriously from the western: but his secret <a id="l2051"></a>designe was to make himself Emperor by the assistance of the Vandals <a id="l2052"></a>&amp; their allies. For he himself was a Vandal. And for faciliating this <a id="l2053"></a>designe he invited a great body of the barbarous nations to invade the Western <a id="l2054"></a>Empire, while he &amp; Alaric invaded the Eastern. And these nations under <a id="l2055"></a>their several kings, the Vandals under Godegisilus, the Alans in two <a id="l2056"></a>bodies, the one under Goar the other under Resplendial, &amp; the Suevians <a id="l2057"></a>Quades &amp; Marcomans under Ermeric, marched through Rhetia to the side <a id="l2058"></a>of the Rhene leaving their seats in Pannonia to the Hunns &amp; Ostrogoths, <a id="l2059"></a>&amp; joyned the Burgundians under Gundicar, &amp; ruffled the Franks in their <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p039r"> &lt;39r&gt; </span> further march, &amp; on the last day of December A.C. 406 <a id="l2060"></a>passed the Rhene at Ments &amp; diffused themselves into Germa<a id="l2061"></a>nia prima &amp; the adjacent regions, &amp; amongst other actions <a id="l2062"></a>the Vandals took Trevirs. Then they advanced into Belgium <a id="l2063"></a>&amp; began to ruffle that country. Whereupon the Salian <a id="l2064"></a>Franks took up arms &amp; under the conduct of Theudemir the son <a id="l2065"></a>of Ricimer or Richomer above mentioned made so stout a <a id="l2066"></a>resistance that they slew almost twenty thousand of the <a id="l2067"></a>Vandals with their king Godegisilus in battel, the rest escaping <a id="l2068"></a>only by a party of Resplendials Alans which came timely to <a id="l2069"></a>their assistance.</p>
<p id="par137">Then the British soldiers allarmed by the rumour of these <a id="l2070"></a>things, revolted &amp; set up Tyrants there; first Marcus whom they <a id="l2071"></a>slew presently, then Gratian whom they slew within four <a id="l2072"></a>months, &amp; lastly Constantine under whom they invaded Gallia A.<a id="l2073"></a>C. 408, being favoured by Goar &amp; Gundicar. And Constantine  <a id="l2074"></a>having possest a good part of Gallia, created his son Constans Cæsar <a id="l2075"></a>&amp; sent him into Spain to order his affairs there, A.C. 409.</p>
<p id="par138">In the mean time Resplendial seeing the aforesaid <a id="l2076"></a>disaster of the Vandals, &amp; that Goar was gone over to the <a id="l2077"></a>Romans, led his army from the Rhene, &amp; together with the Sue<a id="l2078"></a>vians &amp; residue of the Vandals went towards Spain, the Franks <a id="l2079"></a>in the mean time prosecuting their victory so far as to retake <a id="l2080"></a>Trevirs, which after they had plundered they left to the Romans. <a id="l2081"></a>The barbarians were at first stopt by the Pyrenean mountains, <a id="l2082"></a>which made them diffuse themselves into Aquitain: but the next <a id="l2083"></a>year they had the passage betrayed to them by some soldiers of <a id="l2084"></a>Constance  &amp; entring Spain 4 Kal. Octob. A.C. 409, every one <a id="l2085"></a>conquered what he could, &amp; at length, A.C. 411, they divided their <a id="l2086"></a>conquests by lot, &amp; the Vandals obteined Bœtica &amp; part of Gal<a id="l2087"></a>læcia, the Suevians the rest of Gallæcia, &amp; the Alans Lusitania <a id="l2088"></a>&amp; the Carthaginensian Province, the Emperor for peace sake <a id="l2089"></a>confirming them in those seats by grant A.C. 413.</p>
<p id="par139">Also the Roman Franks above mentioned having made Theu<a id="l2090"></a>demir their  king began streight after their con<a id="l2091"></a>quest of the Vandals to invade their neighbours. The first they <a id="l2092"></a>set upon were the Galls of Brabant;<sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup> but meeting with notable <a id="l2098"></a>resistance, they desired their alliance. And so those Galls fell of from <a id="l2099"></a>the Romans, &amp;  made an intimate league with the Franks to be as one <a id="l2100"></a>people, marrying with one another &amp; conforming to one anothers <a id="l2101"></a>manners till they became one without distinction. Thus by the <a id="l2102"></a>access of these Galls, &amp; of the foreign Franks also who afterwards <a id="l2103"></a>came over the Rhene, the Salian kingdom soon grew very great &amp; <a id="l2104"></a>powerfull.</p>
<p id="par140">Stilico's expedition against the Greek Emperor was stopt <a id="l2105"></a>by the order of Honorius, &amp; then Alaric came out of Epire into <a id="l2106"></a>Noricum, &amp; requested a summ of money for his service. The <a id="l2107"></a>Senate were inclined to deny him, but by Stilico's mediation <a id="l2108"></a>granted it. But after a while, Stilico being accused of a traiter<a id="l2109"></a>ous conspiracy with Alaric &amp; slain 10 Kal. Sept. A.C. 408, &amp; <a id="l2110"></a>so Alaric disappointed of his money &amp; reputed an enemy to the <a id="l2111"></a>Empire, brake streight into Italy with his army which he brought <a id="l2112"></a>out of Epire, &amp; sent to his brother Adolphus to follow him with <a id="l2113"></a>what other forces he had in Pannonia, which were not great <a id="l2114"></a>but yet not to be despised. Thereupon Honorius fearing to be shut up <a id="l2115"></a>in Rome, retired to Ravenna in October A.C. 408, &amp; from that <a id="l2116"></a>time Ravenna continued to be the seat of the Western Emperors. <a id="l2117"></a>In those days the Hunns also invaded Pannonia, &amp; seizing the deserted <a id="l2118"></a>seats of the Vandals Alans &amp; Goths founded a new kingdom there. And <a id="l2119"></a>Alaric advancing to Rome beseiged it &amp; 9 Kal. Sept. A.C. 410 took it, &amp; <a id="l2120"></a>afterward attempting to pass into Afric was shipwrackt. After which <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p040r"> &lt;40r&gt; </span> Honorius made peace with him, &amp; got up an army to send <a id="l2121"></a>against the Tyrant Constantine.</p>
<p id="par141">At the same time Gerontius one of Constantines Cap<a id="l2122"></a>tains, revolted from him, &amp; set up Maximus Emperor in Spain. <a id="l2123"></a>Whereupon Constantine sent Edobec, another of his Captains to <a id="l2124"></a>draw to his assistance, besides the barbarians under Goar &amp; Gundicar <a id="l2125"></a>in Gallia, supplies of Franks &amp; Alemans from beyond the Rhene; <a id="l2126"></a>&amp; committed the custody of Vienna in Narbonne to his son Constans. <a id="l2127"></a>Gerontius advancing first slew Constans at Vienna &amp; then began <a id="l2128"></a>to beseige Constantine at Arles. But Honorius at the same time <a id="l2129"></a>sending Constantius with an army on the same errand, Gerontius <a id="l2130"></a>fled, &amp; Constantius continued the siege, being strengthned by the <a id="l2131"></a>access of the greatest part of the soldiers of Gerontius. After four <a id="l2132"></a>months siege, Edobec having procured succours, the barbarian kings <a id="l2133"></a>at Mentz, Goar &amp; Gundicar, constitute Iovinus Emperor &amp; toge<a id="l2134"></a>ther with him set forward to releive Arles. At their approach <a id="l2135"></a>Constantius retired, they pursued, &amp; he beat them by suprize; but <a id="l2136"></a>not prosecuting his victory the Barbarians soon recovered them<a id="l2137"></a>selves, yet not so as to hinder the fall of the Tyrants Constan<a id="l2138"></a>tine Iovinus &amp; Maximus. But Britain could not be recovered <a id="l2139"></a>to the Empire, but remained ever after a distinct kingdom.</p>
<p id="par142">The next year (A.C. 412) the Visigoths being beaten in <a id="l2140"></a>Italy, had Aquitain granted to retire  thence into, &amp; they invaded <a id="l2141"></a>it with much violence, causing the Alans &amp; Burgundians to retreat <a id="l2142"></a>who were then depopulating it. At the same time the Burgundians <a id="l2143"></a>were brought to terms of peace, &amp; the Emperor granted them for <a id="l2144"></a> inheritance a region upon the Rhene which they had invaded <a id="l2145"></a>And the same I presume he did with the Alans. But the Franks <a id="l2146"></a>not long after retaking &amp; burning Trevirs, Castinus A.C. 415 <a id="l2147"></a>was sent against them with an army &amp; routed them &amp; slew <a id="l2148"></a>Theudemir their king. This was the second taking of  <a id="l2149"></a>Trevirs by the Franks. And Merovæus about the year 448 took <a id="l2150"></a>it again &amp; destroyed it. So that it was taken four times, once by <a id="l2151"></a>the Vandals &amp; thrice by the Franks. Theudemer was succeeded <a id="l2152"></a>by Pharamund a Prince of the Franks in Germany. From thence <a id="l2153"></a>he brought new forces, reigned over the whole &amp; had seats <a id="l2154"></a>granted to his people within the Empire neare the Rhene.</p>
<p id="par143">And now the Barbarians were all quieted &amp; setled in <a id="l2155"></a>several kingdoms within the empire not only by conquest but <a id="l2156"></a>also by the grants of the Emperor Honorius. For Rutilius in his Iti<a id="l2157"></a>nerary written in autumn Anno Vrbis 1169, that is, according to Varro's <a id="l2158"></a>computation then in use, A.C. 416, thus laments the wasted fields</p>
<div class="lg"><p class="l">Illa quidem longis nimium deformia bellis, &amp; then adds</p>
<p class="l">Iam tempus laceris post longa incendia fundis</p>
<p>Vel pastorales ædificare casas. And a little after</p>
<p class="l">Æternum tibi Rhenus aret.</p></div>
<p id="par144">And Orosius in this end of his history which was finished A.C. 417, <a id="l2159"></a>represents now a general pacification of the barbarous nations <a id="l2160"></a>by the words comprimere, coangustare, addicere gentes immanissi<a id="l2161"></a>mas, terming them imperio addictas because they had obteined <a id="l2162"></a>seats in the Empire by league &amp; compact, &amp; coangustatas because <a id="l2163"></a>they did no longer invade all regions at pleasure, but by the same <a id="l2164"></a>compact remained quiet within the seats granted them.</p>
<p id="par145">Now by the warrs above described the western Empire was <a id="l2165"></a>broken into the  following kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par146">1 The kingdom of the Vandals</p>
<p id="par147">2 The kingdom of the Suevians.</p>
<p id="par148">3 The kingdom of the Alans in Spain</p>
<p id="par149">4 The kingdom of the Visigoths</p>

<p id="par154">9 The kingdom of the Hunns. </p>
<p id="par155">10 The kingdom of the Lombards.</p>
<p id="par156">11 The kingdom of Ravenna.</p>
<p id="par157" class="i0">Eight of these kingdoms are thus mentioned by Sigonius. <sup>1</sup><em class="underline">Honorio <a id="l2166"></a>regnante in Pannoniam <sup>2</sup>Hunni, in Hispaniam <sup>3</sup>Vandali, <sup>4</sup>Alani, <a id="l2167"></a><sup>5</sup>Suevi et <sup>6</sup>Gothi, in Galliam <sup>7</sup>Alani <sup>8</sup>Burgundiones et <sup>6</sup>Gothi certis <a id="l2168"></a>sedibus permissis accepti</em>. Add the Franks &amp; Lombards who were <a id="l2169"></a>received before the reign of Honorius, &amp; the Britains who were <a id="l2170"></a>conquered long before, &amp; you have all the kingdoms. But let us <a id="l2171"></a>view them severally.</p>
<p id="par158">1. The kings of the Vandals were A.C. 406 Godegisilus, <a id="l2172"></a>407 Gunderic, 426 Geiseric, 477 Huneric, 484 Gundemund, 496 <a id="l2173"></a>Thrasamund, 523 Geiseric, 531 Gelimer. Godegisilus led them into <a id="l2174"></a>Gallia A.C. 406, Gunderic into Spain A.C. 409, Geiseric into Afric <a id="l2175"></a>A.C. 427, &amp; Gelimer was  conquered by Belisarius A.C. 533. Their king<a id="l2176"></a>dom stood in Gallia Spain &amp; Afric together 126 years, &amp; in Afric <a id="l2177"></a>they were very potent.</p>
<p id="par159">2. The kings of the Suevians were, A.C. 406 Ermeric, 438 <a id="l2178"></a>Rechila 448 Rechiarius, 458 Maldra, 460 Frumarius, 463 Remis<a id="l2179"></a>mundus. And after some other kings whose names are unknown, reigned <a id="l2180"></a>A.C. 558 Theodemir, 568 Miro, 582 Euboricus &amp; 583 Andeca. This <a id="l2181"></a>kingdom after its being seated in Spain remained always in Gallæcia <a id="l2182"></a>&amp; Lusitania. Ermeric after the fall of the Alan kingdom enlarged <a id="l2183"></a>it into all Gallicia forcing the Vandals to retire into Bœtica &amp; the <a id="l2184"></a>Carthaginensian Province. This kingdom lasted 177 years  <a id="l2185"></a>according to Isidorus, &amp; then was subdued by Leovigild king of the Visigoths <a id="l2186"></a>&amp; made a Province of his kingdom A.C. 585.</p>
<p id="par160">3 The kings of the Alans in Spain were Resplendial &amp; Ataces <a id="l2187"></a>Vtacus or Othocar. Resplendial began his reign in France A.C. 407 &amp; in Spain A.C. <a id="l2188"></a>409 &amp; Ataces was slain with almost all his army by Vallia king of <a id="l2189"></a>the Visigoths A.C. 419.  And then the remain<a id="l2190"></a>der of these Alans subjected themselves to Gunderic King of the <a id="l2191"></a>Vandals in Bœtica,  &amp;  went after<a id="l2192"></a>wards with the Vandals into Afric as I learn out of Procopius <a id="l2193"></a> &amp; thence the kings of the Vandals in Afric stiled themselves kings of the Vandals &amp; Alans, <a id="l2194"></a>as may be seen in the Edict of Huneric recited by Victor in his history of the Vandalic persecution. In <a id="l2195"></a>conjunction with the Catthi the  Alans gave <a id="l2196"></a>the name of Cathalaunia (or Catth-Alania) to the Province which <a id="l2197"></a>is still so called. These Alans had also Gepides among them.</p>
<p id="par161">4 The kings of the Visigoths were A.C. 400 Alaric, 410 Athaulphus, <a id="l2198"></a>415 Sergeric &amp; Vallia, 419 Theoderic, 451 Thorismund, 452 Theoderic, <a id="l2199"></a>465 Euric, 482 Alaric, 505 Gensalaric, 526 Amalaric, 531 Theudius, <a id="l2200"></a>548 Theudisclus, &amp;c. I date this kingdom from the time that Alaric <a id="l2201"></a>left Thrace &amp; Greece to invade the western Empire. In the end of the <a id="l2202"></a> reign of Athaulphus the Goths were humbled by the Romans &amp; attempt<a id="l2203"></a>ed to pass out of  France into Spain. Sergeric reigned but a few days. <a id="l2204"></a>In the beginning of Vallia's reign they assaulted the Romans afresh but <a id="l2205"></a>were again repulsed &amp; then made peace on this condition that they should <a id="l2206"></a>on the behalf of the  Empire invade the barbarian <a id="l2207"></a>kingdoms in Spain, which they did together with the Romans in the <a id="l2208"></a>years 417 &amp; 418 overthrowing the Alans &amp; part of the Vandals, <a id="l2209"></a>&amp; then received Aquitain of the Emperor by a full donation, <a id="l2210"></a>leaving their conquests in Spain to the Emperor. And thereby the <a id="l2211"></a>seats of the conquered Alans  came  into the <a id="l2212"></a> hands of the Romans. A.C. 455 Theoderic (assisted by the Burgun<a id="l2213"></a>dians) invaded Spain which was then almost all subject to the Suevians <a id="l2214"></a>&amp; took a part of it from them. A.C. 506 the Goths were driven out <a id="l2215"></a>of Gallia by the Franks. A.C. 585 they conquered the Suevian <a id="l2216"></a>kingdom &amp; became Lords of  all Spain. A.C. 713 the Saracens <a id="l2217"></a>invaded them, but in time they recovered their dominions &amp; have <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p042r"> &lt;42r&gt; </span> reigned in Spain ever since.</p>

<h2 id="hd4" class="cent">Chap. VI. <a id="l2218"></a><br>Of the Empire of the Latines.</h2>
<p id="par162">The Romans were at first a small kingdom of Italy <a id="l2219"></a>&amp; began to make a figure in the world about the time that in <a id="l2220"></a>conjunction with the king of Pergamus they took from Antiochus <a id="l2221"></a>all Asia on this side the mountain Taurus, &amp; to grow great <a id="l2222"></a>from the time that they conquered  <a id="l2223"></a>Macedon. For after the conquest of Greece, they conquered <a id="l2224"></a>Carthage &amp; gradually extended their dominion ovfer Asia, <a id="l2225"></a>Spain, Syria, Gallia, Egypt &amp; Dacia, &amp; reigned over all <a id="l2226"></a>these countries untill the revolt of Dacia, &amp; the sepa<a id="l2227"></a>ration of the Empire of  the Greeks from that of <a id="l2228"></a>the Latines: the particular history of all which is <a id="l2229"></a>every where to be met with.</p>

<p id="par164">Dacia was a large country bounded on the south by <a id="l2237"></a>the Danube, on the east by the Euxine sea, on the north <a id="l2238"></a>by the river Neister &amp; the mountain Crapack, &amp; on the west <a id="l2239"></a> by the river Tibesis or Teys which runs south<a id="l2240"></a>ward into the Danube a little above Belgrade, &amp; com<a id="l2241"></a>prehends the countries now called Transylvania Moldavia <a id="l2242"></a>&amp; Wallachia &amp; the eastern part of the upper Hungary. <a id="l2243"></a>Its ancient inhabitants were called Getæ by the Greeks <a id="l2244"></a>&amp; Daci by the Latines &amp; Goths by themselves. Alexander <a id="l2245"></a>the great attackt them &amp; Trajan conquered them &amp; reduced <a id="l2246"></a>their country into a Province of the Roman Empire, &amp; <a id="l2247"></a>thereby the propagation of the Christian religion amongst <a id="l2248"></a>them was much promoted. They were composed of several <a id="l2249"></a>Gothic nations called Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Vandals, Gepides, Lombards, Burgundians &amp;c, all which came originally from the southern <a id="l2250"></a>parts of Scanzia or Scandinavia that great Peninsula in the <a id="l2251"></a>Baltic sea conteining Norway &amp; most of Sweden, &amp; reputed <a id="l2252"></a>an Island by the ancients. Whence it came to pass that <a id="l2253"></a>they all agreed in their manenrs &amp; spake the same language, as Procopius re<a id="l2254"></a>presents. <a id="l2255"></a>Paulus Diaconus in his Historia miscella lib. XIV speaking <a id="l2256"></a>of the times next after the death of Theodosius the great, <a id="l2257"></a>tells us: Eodem tempore erant Gothi et aliæ Gentes max<a id="l2258"></a>imæ trans Danubium habitantes: ex quibus rationabili<a id="l2259"></a>ores quatuor sunt Gothi scilicet, Huisogothi, Gepides et <a id="l2260"></a>Vandali, et nomen tantum et nihil aliud mutantes. Omnes <a id="l2261"></a>autem fidei erant Arianæ malignitatis. Isti sub  Arcadio et Honorio Danubium transeuntes locati sunt <a id="l2263"></a>in terra Romanorum, et Gepides quidem (ex quibus postea <a id="l2264"></a>divisi sunt Langobardi et Avares) villas quæ sunt circa <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p044r"> &lt;44r&gt; </span> Singidonem &amp; Sirmium habitavere. And Procopius in the beginning <a id="l2265"></a>of his historia Vandalica writes to the same purpose.</p>
<p id="par165">Before these nations revolted, the Goths or Ostrogoths were <a id="l2266"></a>seated in the eastern parts of Dacia, the Vandals in the <a id="l2267"></a>western upon the river Teys where the rivers Maresh &amp; <a id="l2268"></a>Keresh run into it; the Visigoths were between them, the <a id="l2269"></a>Gepides were (according to Iornandes) upon the Vistula. The Burgundians, a <a id="l2270"></a>Vandalic nation, were between the Vistula &amp; the southern <a id="l2271"></a>fountain of the Boristhenes at some distance from the <a id="l2272"></a>mountain Crapac northward, where Ptolomy places them <a id="l2273"></a>by the names of Phrugundiones &amp; Burgiones. The Alans <a id="l2274"></a>(another Gothic <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup> nation) were between the northern fountain <a id="l2276"></a>of the Boristhenes &amp; the mouth of the river Tanais where <a id="l2277"></a>Ptolomy places the mountain Alanus. The Roxolani were <a id="l2278"></a>on the southern coast of the Alans &amp; western side of the <a id="l2279"></a>Palus Mœotis.</p>
<p id="par166">In the second year of the reign of the Emperor Philip <a id="l2280"></a>the Goths for want of their pay began to revolt from the <a id="l2281"></a>Romans &amp; under the conduct of their  King <a id="l2282"></a>Ostrogotha, the grandson of Amala being assisted by the Thaphili &amp; Astringi or <a id="l2283"></a>Vandals &amp; the Carpi (other Gothic nations) made war <a id="l2284"></a>upon them.  And the Gepides under their king <a id="l2285"></a>Fastida routed the Burgundians with a great slaughter <a id="l2286"></a>&amp; conquered some other nations &amp; then invaded the said <a id="l2287"></a>Goths &amp; were routed by them. Cniva (called Echina by Pom<a id="l2288"></a>ponius Lætus) succeeded Ostrogotha in the reign of Decius &amp; <a id="l2289"></a>routed the Roman army &amp; slew Decius, &amp; the next year <a id="l2290"></a>invaded Greece Macedon Pontus Asia &amp; Illyricum, &amp; kept <a id="l2291"></a>Illyricum &amp; Macedon almost fifteen years; &amp; then the Goths <a id="l2292"></a> invading the Empire (as Trebellius Pollio tells us) with <a id="l2293"></a>an army of three hundred &amp; twenty thousand Scythians com<a id="l2294"></a>posed of the Peuceni, Grutungi,  Ostrogoths, Vitringi, Gepides <a id="l2295"></a>Heruli &amp;c &amp; being beaten in Mœsia &amp; other places by the <a id="l2296"></a>Emperor Claudius, returned to their seats beyond the Danube. <a id="l2297"></a>And soon after, the Emperor Aurelian, as Vopiscus informs <a id="l2298"></a>us) cum vastatum Illyricum &amp; Mœsiam deperditam <a id="l2299"></a>videret, Provinciam trans Danubium Daciam a Trajano <a id="l2300"></a>constitutam, sublato exercitu &amp; provincialibus, reliquit, <a id="l2301"></a>desperans eam posse retineri: abductosque ex ea populos <a id="l2302"></a>in Mœsia collocavit, appellavitque suam Daciam. This was <a id="l2303"></a>about the year of Christ 272.</p>
<p id="par167">But the Church of Dacia still continued united <a id="l2304"></a>to the Church of the Roman Empire. For Theophilus <a id="l2305"></a>Bishop or Patriarch of Dacia was at the Council of Nice <a id="l2306"></a>A.C. 325 &amp; his successor Vlphilas was at the Council of <a id="l2307"></a>Constantinople A.C. 360.</p>
<p id="par168">Dioclesian in the year 285 divided the Roman Empire <a id="l2308"></a>between himself &amp; Maximianus, retaining the government <a id="l2309"></a>of the eastern nations to himself &amp; leaving that of the western <a id="l2310"></a>to Maximianus . And by this act &amp; the separation of the Goths  the Roman Empire began to be <a id="l2311"></a>divided into the three parts touched upon in the Apocalyps <a id="l2312"></a>the Eastern Empire, the Western Empire &amp; that of the Goths. <a id="l2313"></a>For Dacia was large &amp; the Goths soon became a great Empire.</p>
<p id="par169">Constantine the great built Constantinople A.C. 330, &amp; <a id="l2314"></a>made it the Metropolis of the eastern Provinces of the <a id="l2315"></a>Empire, &amp; Rome of the western; both cities being governed <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p045r"> &lt;45r&gt; </span> after one &amp; the same manner by a Senate &amp; Consuls. <a id="l2316"></a>And by this act he established the division. He left the <a id="l2317"></a>Empire between his sons A.C. 337, &amp; his son Constantius <a id="l2318"></a>reunited it under himself A.C. 353, &amp; Valentinian divided <a id="l2319"></a>it between himself &amp; his brother Valens A.C. 364. And <a id="l2320"></a>after the death of Valens it was reunited under Gratian <a id="l2321"></a>the son of Valentinian A.C. 378. But after five months <a id="l2322"></a>Gratian made  Theodosius emperor of the <a id="l2323"></a>East in the room of Valens 16 Ian. A.C. 379, &amp; Theo<a id="l2324"></a>dosius left the Empire divided between his sons Arcadius <a id="l2325"></a>&amp; Honorius A.C. 395, after which it was no more united.</p>
<p id="par170">The two Empires into which the Roman Empire <a id="l2326"></a>became now divided were distinguished by the names <a id="l2327"></a>of the eastern &amp; western or Greek &amp; Latine Empires. <a id="l2328"></a>And the Greek Empire continued entire about 240 <a id="l2329"></a>years &amp; then lost Syria &amp; Egypt to the Saracens, <a id="l2330"></a>but yet stood  above 800 years longer before  it came into the hands of the Turks. <a id="l2332"></a>This Empire is represented  in Daniel by the He-<a id="l2333"></a>goat &amp; in the Apocalyps by the great red Dragon. The <a id="l2334"></a>Latin Empire is represented by the little horn of the <a id="l2335"></a>He Goat &amp; by the Beast with ten horns. It became a <a id="l2336"></a>horn of the He Goat by inheriting the kingdom of Perga<a id="l2337"></a>mus in Asia minor by the Legacy of Attalus. It had <a id="l2338"></a>seven successive heads which were common to it self &amp; the Dragon &amp; <a id="l2339"></a> answered to the times of the seven seals; but its heads <a id="l2340"></a>are without crowns   &amp; the Dragons heads are <a id="l2342"></a>crowned because the Dragon reigned  first &amp; included the <a id="l2343"></a>Beast in his mystical body untill he gave the Beast his <a id="l2344"></a>throne. It was wounded to death with a sword in the <a id="l2345"></a>reign of Constantius. It revived &amp; its deadly wound was <a id="l2346"></a>healed by the new division of the Empire in the  <a id="l2347"></a>beginning of the reign of Valentinian &amp; Valens. It rose <a id="l2348"></a>out of the Sea at the division of the Empire between Gra<a id="l2349"></a>tian &amp;  Theodosius, &amp;  at its rise appeared with a wound which <a id="l2350"></a>was made &amp; healed in one of its heads  before it <a id="l2351"></a> rose, viz<sup>t</sup> in the head which was when five were fallen, <a id="l2352"></a>that is in the sixt head. At its rise the seventh seal <a id="l2353"></a>was opened &amp; the reign of the seventh head began. <a id="l2354"></a>And at the division of the Empire between the sons of <a id="l2355"></a>Theodosius, the Dragon gave the Beast his power &amp; throne. <a id="l2356"></a>And thereby the Beast became the eighth head, &amp; yet <a id="l2357"></a> was of the seven, being a part of the seventh [so far <a id="l2358"></a>as the seventh was common to them both.] And on this eighth <a id="l2359"></a>head are ten horns all of them crowned, but on the Dragon's head <a id="l2360"></a>they are without crowns. They were therefore  to rise out of nations which were within the Dra<a id="l2361"></a>gons body but  grew not into kingdoms before the <a id="l2362"></a>reign of the eighth head. For they received power as kings at <a id="l2363"></a>or about the same time with the Beast, that is, when the <a id="l2364"></a>Dragon gave the Beast his power &amp; throne or presently after <a id="l2365"></a>the death of Theodosius. And that we may know what kingdoms they were &amp; how they <a id="l2366"></a>rose we must have recourse to the history of the kingdom of Dacia.</p>

<p id="par172"><sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup>Hermaneric succeeded Geberic &amp; conquered the Heruli, <a id="l2381"></a>Veneti, Antes, &amp; Sclavi, &amp; many other warlike nations <a id="l2382"></a>of Scythia &amp; Germany, as Iornandes informs us, &amp; parti<a id="l2383"></a>cularly the nations which Iornandes calls the Thuidi, <a id="l2384"></a>Visinambrocæ, Mœrens, Mordensimnis, Caris, Rocæ, Tad<a id="l2385"></a>zans, Athual, Navigo, Bubegentæ, &amp; Coldæ, &amp; the Æstri <a id="l2386"></a>or Estij a people seated upon the Sinus Finnicus, &amp; the <a id="l2387"></a>Roxolani on the Palus Mœotis, &amp; the Quades &amp; Marcomans<sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup> two German nations seated by Ptolomy in Bohemia on the fountains <a id="l2388"></a>of the Elbe. Thus the kingdom of the Goths by successive <a id="l2389"></a>conquests grew into a large &amp; potent Empire composed <a id="l2390"></a>of many northern nations, &amp; seems in the reign of Hermaneric <a id="l2391"></a>to have extended eastward to the side of the Euxine sea <a id="l2392"></a>the Lake Mœotis &amp; the river Tanais &amp; northward to the Sinus <a id="l2393"></a>Finicus where Revel &amp; Narva are seated &amp; to the fountains <a id="l2394"></a>of the river Volga, where  the city Mosco stands, &amp; westward to the rivers Oder &amp; Mo<a id="l2395"></a>raw &amp; the fountains of the Elbe so as to comprehend Silæisia Moravia &amp; part of Bohemia;,  &amp; by all this extent it seems to have equalled <a id="l2396"></a>the Greek Empire. In this state it continued till the death <a id="l2397"></a>of Hermaneric which was in the year 376 or the year <a id="l2398"></a>before. And from these conquests, saith Iornandes, some <a id="l2399"></a>have compared this king to Alexander the great.</p>
<p id="par173">This king lived very long. &amp; just before his death heard of a great <a id="l2400"></a>army of Hunns coming over the Lake Mœotis &amp; <a id="l2401"></a>beginning to invade him; &amp; then he left his kingdom <a id="l2402"></a>divided among many successors, Hunnimund, Fridigern, <a id="l2403"></a>Vithimar, Athanaric, Box, &amp;  others. Hun<a id="l2404"></a>nimund was his son, &amp; reigned over the eastern part of <a id="l2405"></a>the Goths called Ostrogoths, &amp; Fridigern reigned over <a id="l2406"></a>the western part called Visigoths: for the Goths <a id="l2407"></a>became now divided into two  bodies called by these <a id="l2408"></a>names. Vithimar or Winitharius  was the son of <a id="l2409"></a>Valeravan &amp; grandson of Athaulphus or Vuldulph <a id="l2410"></a>the brother of Hermaneric, &amp; reigned over a part <a id="l2411"></a>of the Goths called Gruthungi by A. Marcelinus, Gothunni <a id="l2412"></a>by Claudian &amp; Sarmatæ &amp; Scythians by others.  <a id="l2413"></a>They were seated  on the north east side of Dacia  neare the Alans. Athaneric reigned in Dacia over another part <a id="l2415"></a>of the Goths called Thervingi; &amp; Box over the Antes in <a id="l2416"></a>Sarmatia; &amp; the Gepides had also their king. These kings <a id="l2417"></a>or some of them seem to have been rectors of Provinces in the life time of <a id="l2418"></a>Hermaneric, &amp; to have kept their governments after his <a id="l2419"></a>death.</p>
<p id="par174">The Goths &amp; other Scythian nations beyond the Danube <a id="l2420"></a>had hitherto lived without letters, &amp; the Christian religion <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p047r"> &lt;47r&gt; </span> had been hitherto propagated among them only by oral <a id="l2421"></a>tradition. But now Vlphilas the Patriarch of Dacia in<a id="l2422"></a>vented the Gothic letters &amp; translated the Scriptures into <a id="l2423"></a>the languages of Dacia, &amp; propagated the  Christian religion very much among the Goths &amp; Gepides, <a id="l2425"></a>so that Fridigern king of the Visigoths became a Christian; <a id="l2426"></a>&amp; Athaneric fearing that the Christian religion should <a id="l2427"></a>also prevail in his kingdome (for the Therungi were a branch of the Visigoths &amp; Vlphilas instructed the <a id="l2428"></a>people of both kingdoms ) raised a vehement persecution <a id="l2429"></a>against the Christians in his kingdom &amp; put many of them to death.</p>
<p id="par175">In the mean time the  Hunns advancing <a id="l2430"></a>under the conduct of their King Balamber or Balamir <a id="l2431"></a>invaded the Alans &amp; other nations between the Tanais <a id="l2432"></a>&amp; Dacia &amp;  after the death of Hermaneric endured Dacia &amp; made the people either <a id="l2433"></a>submit or fly. The Ostrogoths submitted, but the Gru<a id="l2434"></a>thungi made some resistance, their king Winitharius <a id="l2435"></a>having strengthned himself by conquering the Antes <a id="l2436"></a>the year before the Hunns invaded him. He beat the Hunns <a id="l2437"></a>in one or two battels, but was slain by Balamir in the third <a id="l2438"></a>battel, &amp; his kingdom was given by the conqueror to Hunni<a id="l2439"></a>mund. For Sigismund the son of Hunnimund had assisted the <a id="l2440"></a>Hunns in this war with an army of Ostrogoths. After this, <a id="l2441"></a>the Hunns pursued Athanaric, &amp; the greatest part of  his <a id="l2442"></a>people deserting him, fled with some other Goths to the <a id="l2443"></a>side of the Danube  under the conduct of <a id="l2444"></a>Alavivus. Fridigern also fled thither with his people the <a id="l2445"></a>Visigoths. And these nations sent an Embassy to the Emperor <a id="l2446"></a>Valens &amp; obteined leave to pass the Danube &amp; seat them<a id="l2447"></a>selves in Mœsia &amp; Thrace. Their Patriarch Vlphilas was <a id="l2448"></a>at the head of this Embassy. And presently after this, a <a id="l2449"></a>great part of the Gruthungi under the conduct of Alatheus <a id="l2450"></a>&amp; Saphrax the Guardians of Videric the young son of Wi<a id="l2451"></a>nitharius (now their king,) flying from the Hunns &amp; Ostrogoths, <a id="l2452"></a>came to the side of the Danube, &amp; made the same petition; <a id="l2453"></a>but were rejected. Yet they passed the Danube soon after <a id="l2454"></a>without leave, while the Roman army was deteined in <a id="l2455"></a>Rhætia in a war against the Alemans &amp; Sueves. This <a id="l2456"></a>rout was in the year 377.</p>
<p id="par176">These Goths being thus seated in the Empire were <a id="l2457"></a>soon pressed with famin &amp; grosly abused by the Roman <a id="l2458"></a>Governours who sold them dogs flesh &amp; other carrion at <a id="l2459"></a>high rates &amp; otherwise provoked them. Whereupon they <a id="l2460"></a>took up arms, invaded Thrace, called in to their assis<a id="l2461"></a>tance some  Goths Alans &amp; Hunns from beyond <a id="l2462"></a>the Danube, routed the Roman army, slew the Emperor <a id="l2463"></a>Valens &amp; spread themselves into Greece &amp; Pannonia as far <a id="l2464"></a>as the Alps, Alatheus &amp; Saphrax going westward. This <a id="l2465"></a>was in the year 378. But in the years 379 &amp; 380 <a id="l2466"></a>they were checkt by the arms of the Emperors Gratian <a id="l2467"></a>&amp; Theodosius, &amp; made a submissive peace, &amp; the Visigoths <a id="l2468"></a>&amp; Thervingi returned to their seats in Mœsia &amp; Thrace, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p048r"> &lt;48r&gt; </span> the Hunns retired over the Danube, &amp; the Alans &amp; Gru<a id="l2469"></a>thungi obteined seats in Pannonia.</p>
<p id="par177">During this war Athanaric king of the  Thervingi <a id="l2470"></a>came over the Danube &amp;in autumn 1680 made the Em<a id="l2471"></a>peror Theodosius a visit at Constantinople, was honourably <a id="l2472"></a>received, died in Ianuary following, &amp; was splendidly <a id="l2473"></a>interred; &amp; his people seeing this treatment subjected them<a id="l2474"></a>selves immediately to the Emperor without chusing another <a id="l2475"></a>king. But Fridigern King of the Visigoths was succeeded <a id="l2476"></a>by Alaric, &amp; Videric king of the Gruthungi by Radagaisus.</p>
<p id="par178">In the reign of Hermaneric the Lombards came out of <a id="l2477"></a>Scandinavia under the conduct of Ibor &amp; Ayon to seek new <a id="l2478"></a>seats. They were then called Winuli but afterwards from <a id="l2479"></a>their long beards had the name of Langobards given them. <a id="l2480"></a>When the Gothic nations fled from the Hunns  &amp; came in great numbers into the Roman Empire, the <a id="l2482"></a>Lombards also came over the Danube under the conduct of <a id="l2483"></a>the same captains, &amp; beat the Vandals then seated in Panno<a id="l2484"></a>nia, &amp; remained in Pannonia many years. The Vandals <a id="l2485"></a>retired westward, &amp; the Emperor Gratian went into Gallia <a id="l2486"></a>against them &amp; the Alemans together, &amp; the Vandals thereupon <a id="l2487"></a> went back into Pannonia. This was when the Emperor <a id="l2488"></a>Theodosius lay sick at Thessalonica A.C. 379. And accordingly <a id="l2489"></a>Prosper places the victory of the Lombards over the Van<a id="l2490"></a>dals in the Consulship of Ausonius &amp; Olybrius.</p>
<p id="par179">About the year 373 or 374 the Burgundians rose <a id="l2491"></a>from their seats upon the Vistula with an army of eighty <a id="l2492"></a>thousand men &amp; seated themselves in Germany on the side of the Rhene. <a id="l2493"></a>And a body of the Salian Francks with their king were received into the <a id="l2494"></a>Empire by the Emperor Iulian about the year 358 &amp; seated in Gallia between <a id="l2495"></a>Brabant &amp; the Rhene. And in this state things continued <a id="l2496"></a>till the [death of Theodosius. Dragon gave the Beast his  power &amp; throne <a id="l2497"></a>&amp; the] ten horns of the Beast took up arms &amp; received power as kings; which <a id="l2498"></a>was in the following manner.</p>
<p id="par180">After the death of the Emperor Theodosius, the Visi<a id="l2499"></a>goths, under the conduct of Alaric now their king, rose <a id="l2500"></a>from their seats in Thrace &amp; wasted Macedon, Thessaly, <a id="l2501"></a>Achaia Peloponnesus &amp; Epire with fire &amp; sword five <a id="l2502"></a>years together, &amp; then turning westward invaded Dalmatia <a id="l2503"></a>Illyricum &amp; Pannonia, &amp; from thence went into Italy A.<a id="l2504"></a>C. 402, &amp; the next year were so beaten at Pollentia &amp; <a id="l2505"></a>Verona by Stilico the commander of the forces of the <a id="l2506"></a>western Empire, that Claudian calls the remainder of the <a id="l2507"></a>forces of  Alaric <em class="underline">tanta ex Gente <a id="l2508"></a>reliquias breves</em> &amp; Prudentius <em class="underline">gentem deletam</em>. Thereupon <a id="l2509"></a>Alaric made peace with the Emperor, being so far humbled <a id="l2510"></a>that Orosius tells us he did <em class="underline">pro pace optima at quibuscunque <a id="l2511"></a>sedibus suppliciter &amp; simpliciter orare</em>. This peace <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> was <a id="l2514"></a>ratified by mutual hostages, &amp; Ætius was sent hostage to <a id="l2515"></a>Alaric.</p>
<p id="par181">When Alaric took up arms the nations beyond the Danube <a id="l2516"></a>began to be in motion, &amp; the next winter (the winter between <a id="l2517"></a>A.C. 395 &amp;  A.C. 396) a great body of Hunns, Alans,  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p049r"> &lt;49r&gt; </span> Ostrogoths &amp; other northern nations came over the frozen Danube, <a id="l2518"></a>being invited by Ruffin; &amp; their brethren also who had obteined <a id="l2519"></a>seats within the Empire, took up arms. Ierome calls all this great <a id="l2520"></a>multitude Hunns, Alans, Vandals, Goths, Sarmatans, Quades &amp; <a id="l2521"></a>Marcomanns, &amp; saith that they invaded all places between Constanti<a id="l2522"></a>nople &amp; the Iulian Alps, wasting Scythia, Thrace, Macedon, Dar<a id="l2523"></a>dania, Dacia, Thessaly, Achaia, Epire, Dalmatia &amp; all Pannonia. <a id="l2524"></a>And the Suevians also invaded Rhætia. For when Alaric ravaged <a id="l2525"></a>Pannonia, the Romans were defending Rhætia, which gave Alaric <a id="l2526"></a>an opportunity of invading Italy, as Claudian thus mentions.<sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup></p>
<div class="lg"><p class="l">Non nisi perfidia nacti penetrabile tempus</p>

<p class="l">Occupat, atque alio desudant Marte cohortes.</p></div>
<p id="par182" class="i0">And when Alaric went from those parts into Italy, some other <a id="l2527"></a>barbarous nations invaded Noricum &amp; Vindelicia, as the same <a id="l2528"></a>Claudian thus mentions<sup class="note" id="n36-ref">[36]</sup></p>
<div class="lg"><p class="l10">Iam fœdera gentes</p>

<p id="par183" class="i0">Among these nations I reccon the Suevians Quades &amp; Marcomans. <a id="l2529"></a>For they were all in arms at this time, &amp; the Quades &amp; Marco<a id="l2530"></a>mans were Suevian nations &amp; they &amp; the Suevians came origi<a id="l2531"></a>nally from Bohemia &amp; the river   Suevus or Sprahe  in Lusatia sometimes subject <a id="l2532"></a>to the Goths under Hermaneric, &amp; were now united under one common <a id="l2533"></a>king called Ermeric who soon after led them into Gallia. The <a id="l2534"></a>Vandals &amp; Alans might also about this time extend themselves <a id="l2535"></a>into Noricum. Also Vldin with a new great body of Hunns <a id="l2536"></a>passed the Danube about the time of Chrysostoms banish<a id="l2537"></a>ment, that is A.C. 404, &amp; wasted Thrace &amp; Mœsia. <a id="l2538"></a>And Radagaisus king of the Gruthungi, inviting over more <a id="l2539"></a>barbarians from beyond the Danube invaded Italy with an <a id="l2540"></a>army of above 200000 Goths, &amp; the next year (A.C. 405 <a id="l2541"></a>or 406) was overcome by Stilico &amp; perished with his army. <a id="l2542"></a>In this war Stilico was assisted by a great body of Hunns &amp; <a id="l2543"></a>Ostrogoths under the conduct of Vldin &amp; Sarus. They were <a id="l2544"></a>hired by the Emperor Honorius. In all this confusion it was necessary <a id="l2545"></a>for the Lombards in Pannonia to arm themselves in their own defence &amp; assert their liberty, the Romans being <a id="l2546"></a>no longer able to <a id="l2547"></a>protect them.</p>
<p id="par184">And now Stilico purposing to make himself Emperor, <a id="l2548"></a>procured a military Præfecture for Alaric, &amp; sent him into <a id="l2549"></a>the east in the service of Honorius the western Emperor <a id="l2550"></a>committing some Roman Troops to his conduct to strengthen <a id="l2551"></a>his army of Goths, &amp; promising to follow soon after with his <a id="l2552"></a>own army. His pretence was to  recover some regions <a id="l2553"></a>of Illyricum which the eastern Emperor was accused to <a id="l2554"></a>detein injuriously from the western: but his secret designe <a id="l2555"></a>was to make himself Emperor by the assistance of the <a id="l2556"></a>Vandals &amp; their allies: for he himself was a Vandal. <a id="l2557"></a>For faciliating this designe, he invited a great body of <a id="l2558"></a>the barbarous nations to invade the western Empire, <a id="l2559"></a>while he &amp; Alaric invaded the eastern. And these nations <a id="l2560"></a>under their several kings,  the Vandals under Godegisilus, <a id="l2561"></a>the Alans in two bodies, the one under Goar, the other under <a id="l2562"></a>Resplendial; &amp; the Suevians Quades &amp; Marcomans under <a id="l2563"></a>Ermeric marched through Rhetia to the side of the Rhene <a id="l2564"></a>leaving their seats in Pannonia to the Hunns &amp; Ostrogoths <a id="l2565"></a>&amp; joyned the Burgundians under Gundicar, &amp; ruffled the <a id="l2566"></a>Francks in their further march, &amp; on the last day of <a id="l2567"></a>December A.C. 406 passed the Rhene at Ments, &amp; diffused <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p050r"> &lt;50r&gt; </span> themselves into Germania prima &amp; the adjacent regions, &amp; amongst <a id="l2568"></a>other actions the Vandals took Trevirs. They then advanced into <a id="l2569"></a>Belgium, &amp; began to ruffle that country. Whereupon the Salian <a id="l2570"></a>Franks  under the conduct of Theudemir the son of Richomer or Ricimer <a id="l2573"></a>took up arms &amp; made so stout a resistance, that they slew <a id="l2574"></a>almost twenty thousand of the Vandals with their king Gode<a id="l2575"></a>gisilus in battel, the rest escaping only by a party of Resplen<a id="l2576"></a>dials Alans which came timely to their assistance.</p>

<p id="par186"> Then the British soldiers allarm'd by <a id="l2592"></a>the rumour of these things, revolt &amp; set up Tyrants there; first <a id="l2593"></a>Marcus whom they slew presently, then Gratian whom they <a id="l2594"></a>slew within four months, &amp; lastly Constantine under whom they <a id="l2595"></a>invaded Gallia A.C. 408 being assisted by Goar &amp; Gundicar.

[about which time it was that the <a id="l2598"></a>barbarous nations were let into Spain by some of the soldiers of Constans <a id="l2599"></a>betraying the Pyrenean passage to them.]</p>
<p id="par187">Also the Roman Franks above mentioned having made Theu<a id="l2600"></a>demir the Prince of their old royal family king over them, began <a id="l2601"></a>streight after their conquest of the Vandals to invade their neigh<a id="l2602"></a>bours; The first they set upon were<sup>a</sup> <sup class="note" id="n37-ref">[37]</sup> the Galls of Brabant, but meeting with notable resistance, they desired their alliance. <a id="l2607"></a>And so those Galls fell of from the Romans, &amp; the two nations made <a id="l2608"></a>an intimate league to be as one people, marrying with one another <a id="l2609"></a>&amp; conforming to one anothers manners till they became one <a id="l2610"></a>without distinction. Thus by the access of these Galls, &amp; of the <a id="l2611"></a>forreign Franks also who afterwards came over the Rhene <a id="l2612"></a>the Salian kingdom soon grew very great &amp; powerfull.</p>
<p id="par188"> Stilico's expedition against the <a id="l2613"></a>Greek Emperor  was stopt by the order of Honorius, &amp; then Alaric came <a id="l2614"></a>out of Epire into Noricum &amp; requested a summ of money for <a id="l2615"></a>his service. The Senate were inclined to deny him, but by Sti<a id="l2616"></a>lico's mediation granted it.

For  after that, they conquered Carthage  &amp; extended their dominion <a id="l2631"></a>over  Asia Spain Syria Gallia &amp; Egpyt, &amp; reigned over <a id="l2632"></a>those countries  untill the division of the Empire between Rome &amp; Constantinople, <a id="l2633"></a>the particular history of all which  is every where to be met with.</p>
<p id="par190">Constantine the great built Constantinople  A.C. 334 &amp;  <a id="l2634"></a>made it the Metropolis of the eastern provinces of the Empire &amp; Rome <a id="l2635"></a> of the Western. He left the Empire divided between his sons &amp; his <a id="l2636"></a>son Constantius reunited it, &amp; after a few years it became divided <a id="l2637"></a>again  between Valentinian &amp; Valens &amp;  after the death <a id="l2638"></a>of Valens was reunited under Gratian five months &amp; then  divided again <a id="l2639"></a>between Gratian &amp; Theodosius A.C.  379.  <a id="l2640"></a> &amp; Theodosius left it divided between his sons Arcadius &amp; Honorius A.C. 395. ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 51r &gt; </span> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from higher up f 51r resumes &gt; </span> &amp; soon after this <a id="l2644"></a>the western Empire at once A.C. 408 &amp; 409 became divided into ten kingdoms [represented in <a id="l2645"></a>Daniel by the ten toes of Nebuchadnezzars Image &amp; by the ten horns of the fourth Beast.]  This  last division <a id="l2646"></a>being a very signal revolution in the Empire of the Latines &amp; not distinctly described in any historian <a id="l2647"></a>I shall here give an account of the rise &amp; number of these kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par191">The Visigoths – – – – from their number at their first rise. <a id="l2648"></a>And in this divided state the  Latin Empire continued  <a id="l2649"></a>till the rise of the German Empire &amp; still continues to this day.</p>
<p id="par192">In the reign of the Emperor Valens the Hunns rising from their seats  beyond Tanais passed that river &amp; the Niper, &amp; <a id="l2651"></a>invading Dacia &amp; the neighbouring regions subdued  some of the inhabitants &amp; made <a id="l2652"></a>others fly. The Visigoths flying from them passed the Danube  invaded the eastern <a id="l2653"></a>part of the Empire beat &amp; slew Valens, were beaten by Theodosius</p>

For  upon the death of Assaradan or not long after the Empire of the Assyrians began to decline &amp; some of <a id="l2655"></a>the conquered nations to fall off from it. Ægypt had again its own kings &amp; Manasseh was released <a id="l2656"></a>out of Captivity,  &amp; fortified Ierusalem &amp; put garrisons in all Iudea. &amp;  the Medes revolted &amp; built Ecbatane which makes it probable that the Empire fell into  civil <a id="l2657"></a>dissentions, &amp; that Babylon also separated. Herodotus tells us that the Medes were the first who separated <a id="l2658"></a>&amp;  asserted their liberty, but what he tells  us of their living  in villages without a king  till  <a id="l2659"></a> Dejoces a private man gained so much reputation <a id="l2660"></a>among them by acts of justice  as to be chosen king, &amp; that he reigned peaceably 53 years  &amp; built Ecbatane is not likely.  <a id="l2661"></a> They might live in villages without a king till they were conquered <a id="l2662"></a>but they could scarce revolt without a captain to lead their army, &amp; before Dejoces a private man could  make himself <a id="l2663"></a>so famous in all Meadia for doing justice as to be made king, he would be too old to reign 53 years, &amp; the Book of  Iudeth ascribes the <a id="l2664"></a>building of  Ecbatane to Arphaxad a great warrior, who was slain in battel by   the king of Assyria. Which <a id="l2665"></a>makes it probable that the Medes revolted under the conduct of Arphaxad.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p051v"> &lt;51v&gt; </span>
<p id="par200" class="i0">&amp; that Babylon also separated.  But the Medes according <a id="l2666"></a>to Herodotus were the first who separated &amp; asserted their liberty.</p>
<p id="par201">The History of Nebuchadonosor – – – good condition. Arphaxad was therefore <a id="l2667"></a>the Phraortes of Herodotus [&amp;  Ecbatane was built not by Dejoces as <a id="l2669"></a>Herodotus represents but by Phraortes.] – – from Idolatry.</p>

<p id="par203">Now since Arphaxad  was  contemporary to Chiniladon king <a id="l2670"></a>of Babylon &amp; built Ecbatane &amp; had wars which the king of Assyria &amp; Phraortes according to herodotus was the <a id="l2671"></a>first warlike king of the Medes we may reccon that the Medes revolted under  his conduct . [For it is not likely <a id="l2672"></a>that they would revolt without a warlike Prince to lead their army.] &amp; by <a id="l2673"></a>consequence under the conduct of  Phraortes,  &amp; not under that of <a id="l2674"></a>Dejoces who was a quiet Prince, &amp; much less before like Numa – Dejoices their first king reduced them from a salvage life, civilized them by his laws &amp; justice &amp; formed them into a <a id="l2675"></a>body politique  For these things agree better these things agree better to <a id="l2679"></a>the times before they were conquered &amp; civilized by the Assryians then to the times after <a id="l2680"></a>they revolted. And their revolting required a warlike Prince such as was Phraortes to lead their  army.</p> 

<p id="par205">How this king of Assyria after he had vanquished the king of <a id="l2686"></a>the Medes sent Holofernes which an army  to reduce the Western nations <a id="l2687"></a>which had also revolted is described at large  in the book of Iudeth. After <a id="l2688"></a>him reigned Anacyndaraxas  &amp; his son Sardanapalus the two last kings of Assyria.  &amp; <a id="l2689"></a> Callisthenes.</p> 
<p id="par206" class="i0">At that time the Scythians invaded</p>

<p id="par208">In the mean time the Scythians invaded &amp; conquered Media &amp;  went thence towards <a id="l2690"></a>Egypt but were met in Phœnicia by Psammiticus &amp; bought off, &amp; returning into Media  reigned over a great part of Asia for some years &amp; this  <a id="l2691"></a>together which the death of holofernes seems to have put a stop to the victories of the Assyrians.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p052r"> &lt;52r&gt; </span>
<p id="par209">And now the Assyrian Empire seems to have been in its  chief vigor &amp; greatnes <a id="l2692"></a>being united – – – name of Assyria. It comprehended also Cilicia, for there Sardan<a id="l2693"></a>apalus afterwards built  Tarsus &amp; Anchiale. And since conquerors used to  people the borders of their kingdoms which captivated nations for a defence <a id="l2695"></a>therefrom, &amp; Salmanasser placed the ten tribes in Halah &amp; Habor &amp; by the river Gozan <a id="l2696"></a>&amp; in the cities of the Medes, if by  the two first places we may understand Colchos &amp; Iberia by the <a id="l2697"></a>river which runs between them &amp; is now called Cyrus  Corus Cyrrhus  <a id="l2698"></a>&amp; Chiur, we may extend the kingdom of Assyria  over the two Armenias &amp; Media &amp; <a id="l2699"></a> as far as the Caspian &amp; Euxine seas including Colchos &amp; Iberia  <a id="l2702"></a>Asserhadon  is the last king of Assyria, mentioned in scripture. For in the latter end of his reign or  soon after  it, the Assyrian Empire began to decay by the revolting of <a id="l2703"></a>several nations the first of which according to Herodotus was that of the Medes.  If the <a id="l2704"></a>first king of the Medes was as ancient as Herodotus   relates, their revolt <a id="l2705"></a>must have happened neare the beginning of the reign of Assarhadon. But historians <a id="l2706"></a>are apt to lengthen the reign of kings &amp;  Ecbatane the Metropolis of the kingdom  <a id="l2709"></a>was built later then Herodotus represents. </p>

<p id="par211">Assarhadon died in the year of Nabonassar 81 &amp; was succeeded at Babylon <a id="l2717"></a>by Saosduchinus. But whether Saosduchinus was king of all Assyria or of Baby<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>lon<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l2718"></a>alone or only Satrapa of Babylon under the king of Assyria may be doubted. And <a id="l2719"></a>the same – – – – – – from Idolatry.</p>

<p id="par213">The two  last kings of Assyria   are <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n39-ref">[39]</sup> Anacyndaraxes <a id="l2723"></a>Anacyndaraxis seems to have  re his son Sardanapalus. Callisthenes relates that there were two kings of <a id="l2724"></a>Nineveh called Sardanapalus one stout &amp; valiant the other soft &amp; effemi<a id="l2725"></a>nate. The first without question was Assarhadon. For Sardanapalus is <a id="l2726"></a>Assar-hadon-pul. The other was the last king of Assyria. He was con<a id="l2727"></a>temporary to Nabopolassar king of Babylon the successor of Chniladon <a id="l2728"></a>&amp; to Astyages king of the Medes. For Nabopolassar married his son <a id="l2729"></a>Nebuchadnezzar to Amyite the daughter of Asyages. And by this marriage <a id="l2730"></a>having contracted affinity, they conspired against the Assyrians, &amp; being old their <a id="l2731"></a>sons  Nebuchadnezzar &amp; Cyaxeres led the armies of the two <a id="l2732"></a>nations against Nineveh, destroyed the city &amp; shared the kingdom of <a id="l2733"></a>the Assyrians. This victory the  Iews refer to the Chaldeans <a id="l2734"></a>the Greeks to the Medes; Tobit, Polyhistor, Iosephus &amp; Ctesias to both. <a id="l2735"></a>It gave a beginning to the great successes of  Nebuchadnezzar &amp; <a id="l2736"></a>Cyaxeres &amp; laid the foundation of the  two collateral <a id="l2737"></a>Empires of the Babylonians &amp; Medes  which were branches of the Assyrian Empire: &amp; thence the time of the fall of Nineveh is determined <a id="l2738"></a>the conquerors being then in their youth. In the reign of Iosiah <a id="l2739"></a>when Zephany prophesied Nineveh &amp; the kingdom of Assyria  was standing (Zeph. 1.1 &amp; 2.13) And In <a id="l2740"></a>the end of his reign the king of Assyria  reigned over <a id="l2741"></a>the nations upon Euphrates &amp; lost part of his dominions to the king of <a id="l2742"></a>Egypt (2 King. 23.29) But In the third &amp; fourth year of Iehojakim the <a id="l2743"></a>successor of Iosiah – – – –  140.
