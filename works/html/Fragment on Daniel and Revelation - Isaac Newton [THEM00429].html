<p id="par1">For Iosephus tells us that  Herod reigned   34 years after <a id="l1"></a>he slew Antigonus   &amp; 37 years after he obteined the Kingdom  of <a id="l2"></a>the Romans. Now he slew Antigonus  when he took Ierusalem  <a id="l3"></a>    <a id="l4"></a> in the 185<sup>t</sup> Olympiad, in the Consulship of Agrippa &amp; Gallus in the <a id="l5"></a>sabbatical year, in the 3<sup>d</sup> month in the fast as Iosephus relates that is in Iune I. P. 4677 <a id="l6"></a>&amp; he was made king by the Romans three years before,  in the <a id="l7"></a>Consulship of Calvinus &amp; Pollio, &amp; 184<sup>th</sup> Olympiad (as Iosephus also relates) <a id="l8"></a>&amp; by consequence   before midsummer,  I. P. 4674. <a id="l9"></a>Now he died on the 7<sup>th</sup> day of the month Cisleu, (as  the Iews note <a id="l10"></a>in their Calendar, lately printed at Oxford,) that is in  <a id="l11"></a>November or December. He fell sick before an eclips <a id="l12"></a>of the moon which happened a little before the Passover, &amp; during his <a id="l13"></a>sickness went to the bath, imprisoned the nobles of the Iews, &amp; burnt <a id="l14"></a>the Phareses &amp; then died.  All this he did not between the <a id="l15"></a>Eclips &amp; the Passover ( Iosephus affirms not that) but   before the winter <a id="l16"></a>following. Now this eclips fell on March 13, I. P. 4710, as Astro<a id="l17"></a>nomers compute. And therefore Herod  died either in the <a id="l18"></a>winter following when he had reigned 37 years incomplete from the <a id="l19"></a>death of Antigonus &amp; 34 from the  taking of Ierusalem <a id="l20"></a>or in the  winter after that when those years were  complete,  besides some months over.</p>
<p id="par2">The first  of these two cases is favoured by these <a id="l22"></a>arguments.  Thirdly Archelaus the Son &amp; Successor of Herod in Iudæa <a id="l23"></a>reigned nine years &amp; in the 10<sup>th</sup> (saith Iosephus Anti<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>q<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>. l. 17. c. 11 &amp; Excid. l. 2. c. 11 was banished into Gallia  <a id="l24"></a> &amp; he was banished saith Dio in the consulship of Lepidus &amp; <a id="l25"></a>Arruncius, that is I. P. 4719.  <a id="l27"></a>Whence his reign could not begin later then I. P. 4710.  Lastly <a id="l28"></a>Philip the son of Herod (saith Iosephus Antiq. l. 18, c. 6) reigned 37 years &amp; died <a id="l29"></a>in the 20<sup>th</sup> year of Tiberius, that is, I. P. 4747, before September. <a id="l30"></a> Subduct 37 years  incomplete  &amp; the beginning of his reign <a id="l31"></a>may fall on November I.P 4710 but not on the November follow<a id="l32"></a>ing.  Secondly Archelaus the son of Herod newly dead, after <a id="l33"></a>he had quieted a sedition in the feast of the Passover, went to <a id="l34"></a>Rome to get his Father's last will &amp; the Kingdom confirmed to <a id="l35"></a>him by the consent of Augustus; &amp; there saw Caius Cæsar <a id="l36"></a>the nephew of Augustus sitting in the first place in Council <a id="l37"></a>(Ioseph. Antiu. l. 17, c. 11) &amp;  yet its certain by Roman history that Caius went <a id="l38"></a>from Rome before the end of  I. P. 4711, &amp; never <a id="l39"></a>returned thither any more. First Iosephus puts the death of <a id="l40"></a>Herod not long after the eclips, &amp; before the passover of the next <a id="l41"></a>year there was no eclips  for him to reccon <a id="l42"></a>from.</p>
<p id="par3">  Some contend but not fairly that Iosephus is inconsistent with  himself where he tells us that Antipater the father of Herod assisted

P. 4666, &amp; Herod died saith Iosephus about  the 70<sup>th</sup> year of his age.  Suppose now <a id="l50"></a>that Herod was   full 25 years  old &amp; some months  more <a id="l51"></a>when he was made Prefect of Galile, &amp; died when  as many <a id="l52"></a>months were run of the 70<sup>th</sup> year of his age &amp; the difference <a id="l53"></a>will be 44 years. Add these to I. P. 4666 &amp; the life of <a id="l54"></a>Herod will end with I. P. 4710 as above. So you see Iose<a id="l55"></a>phus is in all things very  consonant to himself.</p>
<p id="par4">The birth of Christ therefore being in the days of Herod if it was upon the 25<sup>t</sup> of Ia<a id="l56"></a>nuary, fell upon the end of I.

<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the bottom of the page &gt; </span>  ✱ The wisemen came while Ioseph &amp; Mary were yet  at Nazareth  <a id="l64"></a>  in a journey &amp; by consequence before Mary was well enough to return home. The slaughter <a id="l65"></a>of the infants agrees best with the time of Herods sickness wherein he exercised his greatest cruelties. Luke tells us that when the days of the purifi<a id="l66"></a>cation of the virgin Mary  (that is the 40 days after Christs birth) were ended, &amp; shee  &amp; Ioseph at <a id="l68"></a>the end of that time had performed all things according to the law, they <a id="l69"></a>returned into Galilee to their own city Nazareth, Luc 2.39.  <a id="l73"></a>Matthew tells us that they went first into Egypt till Herod was dead &amp; then <a id="l74"></a>returned to  Nazareth: but it seems the journey into Egypt was <a id="l75"></a>so short that Luke reccons it not. And for this reason I would place the birth <a id="l76"></a>of Christ  not only in the last year of Herod's reign but even within a few months of Herod's death; suppose in the summer before.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 2v resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par5">The  objection against this opinion is that it makes <a id="l77"></a>Christ 32 years old at least  when he was baptized, contrary to the Gospel <a id="l78"></a>of Luke. But the answer is easy. For Luke doth not say that <a id="l79"></a>Christ was then 30 years old, but about 30 years old. He does <a id="l80"></a>not tell you his age accurately, but puts in in the nearest <a id="l81"></a>round number.</p>

<p id="par6">Out of this kingdom of Asia  arose the kingdom of Pergamus <a id="l82"></a>which at first was a very little one then by the assistance of the Romans took <a id="l83"></a> the greatest part of Asia minor from Antiochus magnus king of Syria, afterwards assisted <a id="l84"></a>the Romans in conquering Perseus, &amp; then by the last will &amp; testament of Attalus its <a id="l85"></a>king was inherited by the Romans, &amp; in their power &amp; conduct became mighty &amp; extend<a id="l86"></a>ed it self  southward into Egypt &amp; eastward into Syria &amp; Palestine, &amp; in <a id="l87"></a>the reign of in the reign of Tiberius put the messiah to death &amp; in that of Vespasian took away the daily sacrifice of the Iews &amp; cast down <a id="l88"></a>their sanctuary  &amp; persecuted the Christians &amp; at length separated from the Romans &amp; became the Greek empire seat at Constantinople. And this answers to the little horn which in the latter time <a id="l89"></a>of the kingdom of the four horns was to come out of one of them &amp;  be mighty but not by his own power &amp; wax exceeding great towards <a id="l91"></a>the south &amp; towards the east &amp; towards the pleasant land, &amp;  wax great even <a id="l92"></a>to the  Host of heaven  &amp;  take away the daily sacrifice &amp; cast <a id="l93"></a>&amp; cast down the stars &amp; magnified himself to the Prince of the host &amp; cast down the place of his sanctuary, &amp;  destroy the holy people &amp; <a id="l94"></a>prosper &amp; practise, </p>
<p id="par7">This Empire being monarchical &amp; of long continuance &amp; conteining  precisely the <a id="l95"></a>whole body of the Goat, deserved as much to be represented by the last horn of <a id="l96"></a>the Goat as the kingdom of Alexander did to be represented by the first great horn <a id="l97"></a>which grew between the Goats eyes.   This Prophesy was for many days   at least 2300 that is for so many years: it reaches to the time <a id="l99"></a>of the end &amp; the Goat is still in being as are all Daniels Beasts &amp; to this day it <a id="l100"></a>signifies the nations of the Greek Empire. And therefore that empire while in a <a id="l101"></a>monarchical form was a horn of the Goat &amp;  the most considerable of all <a id="l102"></a>the horns   &amp; so was the Goats last horn. It answers exactly to  that horn   &amp; ought not to want <a id="l104"></a>a representation &amp; there is nothing but that horn to represent it. </p>
<p id="par8">If you think it improper to represent the nations of the Greek Empire by <a id="l105"></a>a  distinct horn in the time of  their subjection to the Romans, you are to consider that horns    signify  kingdoms as well united under one common monarch as separate under several monarchs. So the two horns of <a id="l108"></a>the Ram signify the kingdoms of Media &amp; Persia under one common king &amp; the  <a id="l109"></a> eastern &amp; Northern horn of the  Goat signify the kingdoms of <a id="l110"></a>Syria &amp; Asia  sometimes under one  king sometimes under several.  <a id="l111"></a>The Goat signifies the four headed kingdom of the Greeks as well  united <a id="l112"></a>to the Romans as separate from them: &amp; when the Goat signifies that kingdom <a id="l113"></a>its not improper to represent it also by  a horn of the Goat. The Romans <a id="l114"></a>when they inherited the kingdom of Pergamus did not breake of or destroy a <a id="l115"></a>horn of the Goat but possest it. By the last will &amp; testament of Attalus They succeeded  him in the throne <a id="l116"></a>of his kingdom &amp; reigned in his stead.  They were king of Pergamus till they lost that <a id="l117"></a>kingdom by the separation of the Greek Empire from the Latin. So far was <a id="l118"></a>the union of the Greeks &amp; Latins from being an objection that it was <a id="l119"></a>nec<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ess<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ary to make good the Prophesy, concerning this horn. For Daniel saith <a id="l120"></a>that <em class="underline">it should be mighty but not by its own power.</em> Which is as much as <a id="l121"></a>to say that in the time of its greatness it should  not act apart by <a id="l123"></a>its own power but be mighty by another power superior to its own.</p>

<p id="par20">9 The kings of the Hunns were A. C. 408 Octar &amp; Rugila 433 Bleda &amp; Attila. Octar <a id="l165"></a>&amp; Rugila were the brothers of Munzuc king of the Huns in Gothia beyond the <a id="l166"></a>Danube &amp; Bleda &amp; Attila his sons. The two first Iornandes tells us were kings <a id="l167"></a>of the Hunns but not of them all &amp; had the two last for their successors. <a id="l168"></a>The founding of this kingdome under the two first A. C. 408 is thus described by <a id="l169"></a>Sigonius: Constat quod Gothis ex Illyrico profectis Hunni successerunt atque imprimis <a id="l170"></a>Pannoniam tenuerunt. Neque enim Honorius viribus ad resistendum – – – memoratur. <a id="l171"></a>How Ætius was Hostage first to the Goths &amp; then to the Hunns is  related by <a id="l172"></a>Frigeridus who when he had mentioned that Theodosius Emperor of the east <a id="l173"></a>sent  grievous commands to Iohn who after the death of Honorius <a id="l174"></a> usurped the crown of the western empire, he subjoyns, Iis permotus Ioannes <a id="l175"></a>Ætium id temporis curam palatij gerentem cum ingenti auri pondere ad <a id="l176"></a>Chunnos transmisit notos sibi obsidiatûs sui tempore &amp; familiari amicitia <a id="l177"></a>devinctos — And a little after: Ætius tribus annis Alaria obses, dehinc <a id="l178"></a>Chunnorum, posthæc Carpilionis gener ex Comite domesticorum &amp; Ioannis <a id="l179"></a>Cura palatij. Now Bucher shews that Ætius was hostage to Alaric till the <a id="l180"></a>year 410 when Alaric died &amp; to the Hunns between the years 411 &amp; 415 &amp; son in law to Carpilio about the year 417 or 418 &amp; Curopalates to Iohn about the <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>year<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> 423 <a id="l181"></a>Whence its probable that  he became hostage to the Hunns about the year 413 when Honori<a id="l182"></a>us made  leagues with almost all the barbarous nations &amp; granted them seats. <a id="l183"></a>Its further manifest out of Prosper that the Hunns were in quiet possession <a id="l184"></a>of Pannonia in the year 432. For in the 1<sup>st</sup> book of Eusebius's Chronicle he writes Anno <a id="l185"></a>10<sup>mo</sup> post obitum Honorij cum ad Chunnorum gentem cui tunc Rugula <a id="l186"></a>præerat post prœlium cum Bonifacio se Ætius contulisset impetrato auxilio <a id="l187"></a>ad Romanorum solum regreditur. And in the 2<sup>d</sup> book Ætio &amp; Valerio Coss: <a id="l188"></a>Ætius desposita potestate profugus ad Hunnos in Pannonia pervenit quorum <a id="l189"></a>amicitia auxilioque usus pacem principum interpellatæ potestatis obtinuit. <a id="l190"></a>Hereby it is manifest that at this time Rugula reigned over the Hunns in <a id="l191"></a>Pannonia &amp; that Pannonia was not now  accounted within the soile of the <a id="l192"></a>Empire being formerly granted away to the Hunns ; &amp; that these were the very same <a id="l193"></a>Hunns with which Ætius had in the time of his being  an hostage contracted friend<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004v"> &lt;4v&gt; </span>ship: by vertue of which as he sollicited them before to the aid of Iohn the <a id="l194"></a>Tyrant A. C. 424 so  now he procured their intercession for himself with <a id="l195"></a>the Emperor. Octar died A. C. 430 for Socrates tells us that about that time <a id="l196"></a>the Burgundians having been newly vext by the Hunns upon intelligence of Octars <a id="l197"></a>death seing them without a leader set upon them suddenly with so great <a id="l198"></a>success that 300 Burgundians slew 10000 Of Rugilla's (or as Maximus calls <a id="l199"></a>him Rechilla) being   now king in Pannonia you have heard already. He died <a id="l200"></a>A. C. 433 &amp; was succeeded by Bleda as Prosper &amp; Maximus inform us. This <a id="l201"></a>Bleda with his brother Attila were before this time kings of the Hunns <a id="l202"></a>beyond the Danube their father Mun<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>zu<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>c's kingdom being divided between <a id="l203"></a>them, &amp; now  they united the kingdom of Pannonia to their own. <a id="l204"></a>Whence Paulus Diaconus saith they did Regnum intra Pannonias Daciamque <a id="l205"></a>gerere.

C. 444, &amp; inherited his dominions &amp; invaded the Empire afresh.

This ejection was to the reign of Avitus as is mentioned <a id="l215"></a>in the Chronicum Boiarum &amp; in Sidonius carm. 7 in Avitum which speaks thus <a id="l216"></a>of that Emperor</p>

<p id="par25">The Visigoths to whom  Theodosius the great had granted seats in the Eastern part of the Empire <a id="l247"></a>after the death of the Emperor rose up in arms made Alaric their  Captain &amp; troubled that part <a id="l248"></a>of the Empire for about five years together &amp; then  advancing towards the western Empire he was <a id="l249"></a>so soundly beaten by Stilico the commander of the forces of that  Empire  that  <a id="l250"></a>Claudian called the remainder of his forces <em class="underline">tanta ex gente reliquias breves</em> &amp; <a id="l251"></a>Prudentius <em class="underline">gentem deletam</em>.

Whereupon those <a id="l262"></a>nations under several kings, the Vandals under Godegisilus, the Alans  <a id="l263"></a> in two bodies one under Goar the other under Resplendial, the <a id="l264"></a>Suevi under Ermeric &amp; the Burgundians under Gundicar in the end of A.

<p id="par35">And tho this horn is now commonly interpreted of <a id="l355"></a>Antiochus Epiphanes yet antiquity thought otherwise. For Ierome <a id="l356"></a>in his commentary on this 8<sup>th</sup> chapter of Daniel tells us that <a id="l357"></a>many Christians refer this place to Antichirst. Of this <a id="l358"></a>number I find Origen cont. Cels. l. 6 Irenæus l. 5. c. 25, <a id="l359"></a>Effrem Syrus, Epiphanius. And indeed the name of Anti<a id="l360"></a>christ seems to have been taken by the Apostles &amp; first Christians from this horns standing <a id="l361"></a>up <em class="underline">against the Prince of Princes</em>. As for Antiochus, he <a id="l362"></a>was no new horn but one of the many Kings of an old <a id="l363"></a>one. He did not wax great towards the east &amp;  south,  nor grow from a little horn,  to a <a id="l365"></a>great one, but was a great at first as at last. He was <a id="l366"></a>so far from growing greater then the four horns  <a id="l367"></a>(as the little horn did) that he was always less &amp; more <a id="l368"></a>inconsiderable then most of his Ancestors. <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>H<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> was great <a id="l369"></a>in no other power then his own.

And Daniel himself saith that <a id="l374"></a>in his plots &amp; designes to do mischief he should not <a id="l375"></a>prosper because the end was not yet Dan. 11.27. He <a id="l376"></a>only took away the daily sacrifice  &amp; did not cast <a id="l377"></a>down the place of his sanctuary  as the <a id="l378"></a>kingdom of Pergamus under the Romans did &amp; as the <a id="l379"></a>little horn is said to do, Dan. 8.11. Nor did the pollu<a id="l380"></a>tion of the sanctuary by him continue so much as <a id="l381"></a>2300 natural days or six years &amp; four months. <a id="l382"></a>It lasted but three years from the pollution of the <a id="l383"></a>Altar 1 Mac. 1.54, &amp; 4.52, &amp; if it be dated from <a id="l384"></a>Antiochus his taking away the vessels of the Temple <a id="l385"></a>which was two years before 1 Mac. 1.20, 29 it will <a id="l386"></a>be but five years, but if from Iason's apostasy <a id="l387"></a>&amp; setting up a place of exercise for the heathen <a id="l388"></a>customes  (1 Mac. 1.11, 14 &amp; 2 Mac: 4.9) <a id="l389"></a>it will be above eight. For Iason did that above three <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> years before Antiochus took away the Vessels of the <a id="l390"></a>Temple. 2 Mac. 4.23, &amp; 5.15, 16. So then the conditi<a id="l391"></a>ons of this little horn do not at all agree to Antiochus &amp; if <a id="l392"></a>he be excluded, the Kingdom of Pergamus to whom they <a id="l393"></a>fully agree must necessarily be admitted.</p>
<p id="par36">Now the reign of the Goat is in the prophesy <a id="l394"></a>of the scripture of truth distinguished into  five main <a id="l395"></a>periods. The first conteins the reign of the     Persians &amp; the second that of the Greeks till the beginning <a id="l397"></a>of the fourth Monarchy, the   third the united <a id="l398"></a>reign of the fourth Monarchy represented by the iron <a id="l399"></a>leggs of Nebuchadnezzars Image &amp; the  fourth &amp; fift <a id="l400"></a>the times of the end in which the divided feet  reign.  And the   reign of the little horn of the fourth beast.</p>
<p id="par37">    In  the  second period <a id="l401"></a>he enumerates the Kings of the Greeks in order down to Antiochus Epiphanes &amp; then <a id="l402"></a>concludes  the period thus. <em class="underline">And both these Kings <a id="l403"></a>hearts</em>  [the hearts of Antiochus  &amp; Ptolomy] <a id="l404"></a><em class="underline">shall be to do mischief</em>  <em class="underline">&amp; they <a id="l405"></a>shall speak  lies at one table but it shall not prosper <a id="l406"></a>for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</em> that is <a id="l407"></a> they shall designe  mischief against the Iews but it shall <a id="l408"></a>not prosper because there is yet another period of time <a id="l409"></a>before the time of the end commence wherein the attempt <a id="l410"></a>of placing the abomination is to  succeed. The se<a id="l411"></a>cond period therefore we may date from that attempt &amp; <a id="l412"></a>by consequence from the  contemporary conquest of the Kingdom <a id="l413"></a>of Macedon by the Romans &amp; King of Pergamus toge<a id="l414"></a>ther,  from whence the times of the fourth Monar<a id="l415"></a>chy use to be dated. For with respect to this conquest  <a id="l416"></a> Daniel  begins the next period thus <a id="l417"></a><em class="underline">And out of him arms shall stand up</em>. How these arms <a id="l418"></a>took away the daily sacrifice &amp; cast down the place of <a id="l419"></a>the sanctuary (as tis said of the little horn) Daniel himself <a id="l420"></a>describes in his  weeks. <em class="underline">And the people of a Prince <a id="l421"></a>that shall come</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">shall destroy the city &amp; the sanctu<a id="l422"></a>ary — &amp; in half a week he shall cause the sacrifice &amp; <a id="l423"></a>oblation to cease &amp; upon a wing of abominations he <a id="l424"></a>shall make it desolate</em>.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p010v"> &lt;10v&gt; </span>
<p id="par38">In this  third period he further describes how the  <a id="l425"></a>saints   fall many days by this  persecuting Empire &amp; then <a id="l426"></a>by the conversion thereof to Christianity are helpen with a little <a id="l427"></a>help  &amp; many coming over from heathenism cleave to them <a id="l428"></a>with flatteries, &amp; therefore those of understanding to distinguish them <a id="l429"></a>from the rest shall fall again  to the time of the end because it is yet <a id="l430"></a>for a time appointed. This is the end of the  third period.</p>
<p id="par39">In the  fourth   which commences with <a id="l431"></a>the division of the Empire, he proceeds to describe how  <a id="l432"></a>their  new fall shall be occasioned by the new setting up of <a id="l433"></a>idolatry.   <em class="underline">For the King</em>, saith he, <a id="l434"></a> <em class="underline">shall do according to his will</em> (  not according to God's will but his own) <em class="underline">&amp; he shall exalt himself &amp; magnify him<a id="l436"></a>self above every god  Yea against the God of Gods shall he speak marvellous things  &amp; shall prosper till the indignation be accomplish<a id="l438"></a>ed</em>, (that is till Gods people be   made desolate by setting <a id="l439"></a>up this abomination,) <em class="underline">for that that is  decreed shall come to pass. <a id="l440"></a>Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers nor the desire <a id="l441"></a>of weomen</em>  ( as to marriage) <em class="underline">nor regard any God: for <a id="l442"></a>he shall magnify himself above   every thing.

<p id="par41">With the fall of this kingdom are conjoyned <a id="l465"></a>the delivery of the Iews, the great tribulation &amp; <a id="l466"></a>the resurrection of the dead. <em class="underline">And many of them <a id="l467"></a>that sleep in the dust  of the earth</em>, saith he <a id="l468"></a><em class="underline">shall awake, some to everlasting life &amp; some to shame <a id="l469"></a>&amp; everlasting  contempt: &amp; they that be wise shall <a id="l470"></a>shine as the  brightness of the firmament &amp; <a id="l471"></a>they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for <a id="l472"></a>ever &amp; ever. – – – But go thy way Daniel for thou shalt</em> <a id="l473"></a>rest &amp; stand in thy lot at the end of the days.

<p id="par42">Now  since the  spoiling &amp; pro<a id="l483"></a>faning the Temple  by Antiochus Epiphanes was the first act of that kind &amp; fell in with the joynt beginning of <a id="l484"></a>the reign of the fourth Monarchy &amp;  of the little horn of the Goat as they are <a id="l486"></a>considered  in Daniel:  &amp; since the last act of  placing <a id="l490"></a>the abomination  was in  that sharp <a id="l491"></a>&amp; lasting controversy  among the Greeks about Image-<a id="l492"></a>worship;  which ended in the year of Christ 842 when the Empress Theodora <a id="l493"></a>with her Son called a Council &amp; set up that worship:  if we <a id="l494"></a>date the 2300 days from the first period &amp; the <a id="l495"></a>1290 days from the last,  &amp; put years for days: the two numbers will end together <a id="l496"></a>about the year of Christ 2132. But whether this be the true <a id="l497"></a>computation I do not know, neither do I know <a id="l498"></a>whether the time times &amp; half a time must be <a id="l499"></a>dated from the year 607 when the whore of Babylon <a id="l500"></a>by the grant of Phocas began her ecclesiastical reign over <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005v"> &lt;5v&gt; </span> the Beast or  from some later period. What God has <a id="l501"></a>wrapt up in obscurity that it might not be foreknown <a id="l502"></a>would be great rashness for any man to pretend to foreknow. <a id="l503"></a>Tis enough if we can understand what is already fulfilled <a id="l504"></a>&amp; thereby be  convinced that the world is governed by pro<a id="l505"></a>vidence.</p>

<p id="par44">When the Angel had thus told what was written in the <a id="l506"></a>book of the scripture of truth he bids Daniel <em class="underline">shut up the <a id="l507"></a>words &amp; seal the book till the time of the end</em>. But at <a id="l508"></a>the time of the end it was to be opened again because <a id="l509"></a>he subjoyns that <em class="underline">Many shall run to &amp; fro &amp; knowledge <a id="l510"></a>shall be encreased</em>. &amp; the wise shall understand but none of the wicked shall understand This book is therefore the same book <a id="l511"></a>with that  whose seven seales  the <a id="l512"></a>Lamb opens in the Apocalyps. Daniel sealed it &amp; the <a id="l513"></a>Lamb openes it by degrees untill the time of the end approach  &amp; then many run to &amp; fro &amp; knowledge <a id="l514"></a>is encreased, For the two witnesses prophesy out of it in <a id="l515"></a>sackcloth  1260  prophetick days &amp; then  <a id="l516"></a> ascend up to heaven in a cloud of people &amp; the <a id="l517"></a>gospel is preached to all nations.   So then the Apo<a id="l520"></a>calyps   (as the word imports) is <a id="l521"></a>nothing else but  a re   an unsealing &amp; opening <a id="l523"></a> of Daniel's  Book, a revelation of what was <a id="l524"></a>shut up in his prophesies, or a commentary upon him. <a id="l525"></a>And therefore we may expect to find in Iohn a repe<a id="l526"></a>tition &amp;  fuller declaration of whatever we meet with in <a id="l527"></a>Daniel concerning the fourth Empire. And so it is.</p>
<p id="par45">For his fourth Beast  is  repeated  &amp; more fully described in Iohn's ten horned <a id="l529"></a>Beast with the whore upon his back. And since this Beast  is <a id="l530"></a> the  Latin Empire &amp; the <a id="l531"></a>Dragon that  of the Greeks his  third Beast the Leopard <a id="l532"></a>or He Goat is repeated in this Dragon. For so Iohn tells <a id="l533"></a>you expresly, in saying that <em class="underline">Satan</em> has his Throne in Per<a id="l534"></a>gamus &amp; dwells there &amp; that the <em class="underline">Dragon</em> is that old Serpent <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span>  the Devil &amp; <em class="underline">Satan.</em> Apoc. 2.13 &amp; 12.9.

And   if a <a id="l541"></a>Dragon &amp; a Goat are types of the same kind, both <a id="l542"></a>signifying Dæmons &amp; idolatrous kingdoms; well might Iohn <a id="l543"></a>represent that kingdom by a Dragon which Daniel did <a id="l544"></a>by a Goat,  The last reign of <a id="l546"></a>the Goat wherein he was to place the abomination <a id="l547"></a>of desolation could not be more fitly represented <a id="l548"></a>then by the Dragon that old Serpent called the De<a id="l549"></a>vil &amp; Satan who deceives the whole world. When <a id="l550"></a>this  Devil was cast out of heaven he <em class="underline">came down <a id="l551"></a>amongst the inhabitants of the earth &amp; Sea</em> with <em class="underline">great <a id="l552"></a>wrath knowing he had but a short time</em>. Apoc. 12. These <a id="l553"></a>inhabitants were God's people because this  Devil was <a id="l554"></a>not amongst them before &amp; therefore since he is the type of idolatry he came to <a id="l555"></a>place the abomination among them: which is as much <a id="l556"></a>as to say that he is the last horn of the Goat.</p>
<p id="par46">Now these things being fixed, fix all the rest. For if <a id="l557"></a>the Dragon &amp; Beast be the Greek &amp; Latin Empires &amp; <a id="l558"></a>every kingdom has its Church we must find two churches <a id="l559"></a>for these two kingdoms. And therefore since the <a id="l560"></a>woman is the Church of the Beast (for she rides upon <a id="l561"></a>him) it remains that the two horned Beast must <a id="l562"></a>be the church of the Dragon. For this Beast had <a id="l563"></a>two horns like the Lamb &amp; is called the fals Prophet <a id="l564"></a>&amp; therefore was a church &amp; he spake as the Dragon <a id="l565"></a>that is in  the Dragon's language which was Greek. </p>
<p id="par47">The rise of these two kingdoms with their chur<a id="l566"></a>ches is described  in the 12<sup>th</sup> &amp; 13<sup>th</sup> chapters of the Apo<a id="l567"></a>calyps. First there is but one kingdom represented by the <a id="l568"></a>Dragon &amp; one church represented by the woman. Then by <a id="l569"></a>the rise of the Beast out of the Sea (that is out of the isles <a id="l570"></a>of the Sea, as the Iews called these western countries) the Empire <a id="l571"></a>becomes divided into the Dragon &amp; Beast, &amp; the woman at the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006v"> &lt;6v&gt; </span> same time flies  from the face of the Serpent into the <a id="l572"></a>wilderness where the Beast reigns &amp; so becomes his <a id="l573"></a>church, &amp; the two horned Beast rises out of the earth (as <a id="l574"></a>the Iews called the eastern countries) to represent the Church <a id="l575"></a>of the Dragon.</p>
<p id="par48">Their fall is described in the 18<sup>th</sup> &amp; 19<sup>th</sup> chapters <a id="l576"></a>where the whore is  burnt with fire &amp; then the Beast &amp; <a id="l577"></a>fals Prophet cast into the lake of fire &amp; the remnant that <a id="l578"></a>is the eastern nations  politically slain,  &amp; their <a id="l579"></a>spirit the Dragon that old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan <a id="l580"></a>cast into the bottomless <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>pit<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> to descend ad inferos into Hades.</p>
<p id="par49">Besides these four, there are the people of God re<a id="l581"></a>presented by the remnant of the woman's seed  which <a id="l582"></a>the woman leaves in the Dragon's kingdom &amp; by the two witnesses <a id="l583"></a>prophesying in the Beast's. And in understanding these six <a id="l584"></a>things, together with the Image of the Beast (which is a body <a id="l585"></a>representative of a kingdom, such as is a Senate or <a id="l586"></a>Council) consist's all the mystery of the Apocalyps. So then this <a id="l587"></a>book is nothing els but a commentary upon Daniel's <a id="l588"></a>fourth Beast &amp; He Goat with their churches  <a id="l589"></a>fals &amp; true.</p>
<p id="par50">This prophesy is also distinguished into the same periods <a id="l590"></a>of time with  those of Daniel. First the Lamb opens <a id="l591"></a>the seven seals during the reign of the iron leggs of <a id="l592"></a>Nebuchadnezzars image, then while the feet reign the seven <a id="l593"></a>trumpets sound, the three last of which are the time of <a id="l594"></a>the end wherein the King of the south  pushes at the King  who does according to his will &amp; the <a id="l596"></a>King of the north comes against him  For the army of Locusts at the fift Trumpet since this animal lives <a id="l598"></a>only in hot countries, is the king of the south. They torment <a id="l599"></a>men but kill them not; that is, to use Daniels language they push at the greek <a id="l600"></a>empire but destroy it not: And the army of  Euphra<a id="l601"></a>tean hormen who kill the third part of men is the king <a id="l602"></a>of the north;  for he comes against the king  <a id="l603"></a>  of Greece , saith Daniel, with horsmen &amp; over<a id="l604"></a>flows his countries. The third part of men is the third part of the <a id="l605"></a>  four monarchies whereof the two first make one, &amp; the Roman distinguished into the Greek &amp; Latin Empires the other two When Iohn had said how the third part of these were <a id="l609"></a>killed,  to  insinuate that these had set up the abomina<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001r"> &lt;1r&gt; </span>tion, he subjoyns,  And the rest of men (that is the rest of <a id="l610"></a>men prophesied of by Iohn, or the rest of the Roman Empire) <a id="l611"></a><em class="underline">yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should <a id="l612"></a>not worship Dæmons &amp; idols of gold &amp; silver &amp; brass &amp; stone <a id="l613"></a>&amp; wood which can neither see nor hear nor walk.</em> Mark <a id="l614"></a>that.</p>

<p id="par52">Now as  in Daniel the resurrection of the dead  immediately <a id="l615"></a>follows the end of the king of the north so it does in <a id="l616"></a>Iohn. For saith he The second wo is past behold the <a id="l617"></a>third wo cometh quickly &amp; then the last Trumpet <a id="l618"></a>sounds to that war which puts an end to the four monarchies &amp; the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms <a id="l619"></a>of Christ &amp; the time of the dead is come that they <a id="l620"></a>should be judged. And as all these things are  again <a id="l621"></a>described in Daniels vision of the four Beasts where <a id="l622"></a>the Ancient of days sits in a fiery throne in judgment &amp; the beast is con<a id="l623"></a>demned to the burning flames &amp; the Son of man comes <a id="l624"></a>in the clouds  &amp; receives a kingdom that all nati<a id="l625"></a>ons should obey him: so they are again described in <a id="l626"></a> Iohn where the  Word of God comes with his army in  heaven <a id="l627"></a> against the Beast &amp; fals Prophet &amp; they are <a id="l628"></a>cast into the Lake of  fire &amp;  the saints sit on <a id="l629"></a>thrones &amp; judgment is given them &amp; the dead are raised <a id="l630"></a>&amp; reign with Christ. And  this judgment is again  described more fully by God sitting on a great <a id="l632"></a>white throne &amp; the dead standing before him &amp; being <a id="l633"></a>judged out of the books. For in this judgment the heaven <a id="l634"></a>&amp; earth fly away &amp; therefore it precedes the new <a id="l635"></a>heaven &amp; new earth &amp; new Ierusalem,  &amp; so is <a id="l636"></a> the same with that <a id="l638"></a>judgment in Daniel wherein the Beast is cast into the burning flames.. For  the new Ierusa<a id="l639"></a>lem is said to come down out of heaven as a <a id="l640"></a> Bride prepared for her husband &amp; therefore <a id="l641"></a> is the lambs wife who had made herself <a id="l642"></a>ready  before the marriage supper    &amp;  came <a id="l644"></a>down before that supper &amp; by consequence before the <a id="l645"></a> beast  was cast into the lake of fire &amp;  all the <a id="l646"></a>fowls of heaven were filled with the flesh of the slain <a id="l647"></a>at the supper of the great God, Apoc. 19. This judgment <a id="l648"></a>therefore comprehends the time both of the first resurrection </p>
