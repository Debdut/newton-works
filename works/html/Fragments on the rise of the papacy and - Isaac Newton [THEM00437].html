The Nicene Decree was  this: Antiqua <a id="l3"></a>consuetudo servetur per Ægyptum Libyam et Pentaplim, ita ut <a id="l4"></a>Alexandrinus Episcopus horum omnium habeat potestatem quia et urbis <a id="l5"></a>Romæ Episcopo paribis mos est: Similiter autem et apud Antiochiam <a id="l6"></a>cæterasque Provincias, sius privilegia serventur Ecclasÿs. Illud autem <a id="l7"></a>generaliter clarum est quod siquis præter sententiam Metropolitani  <a id="l8"></a>fuerit factus episcopus, hunc magna synodus definivit episcopum esse non opor<a id="l9"></a>tere.    Now it is observable that this Canon relates only to Provinces &amp; their metropolitans. <a id="l10"></a>For  after the    <a id="l11"></a>Bishops of Rome &amp; Alexandria with their Churches were named the  Council <a id="l12"></a>adds: similiter apud Antiochiam cæterasque provincias. Here is no mention of <a id="l13"></a>Patriarchs superior to Metropolitans of Provinces. The Council only ordeins <a id="l14"></a>that the Metropolitans of every Province should have power over the <a id="l15"></a>bishops of his Province, the bishop of Rome over the bishops of the Province <a id="l16"></a>of Rome, the Bishop of Alexandria over the Province of Ægypt &amp; Libya, the bishop of Antioch over the <a id="l17"></a>Province of Antioch, the bishop of Cæsarea of Cappadocia over the Province <a id="l18"></a>of Pontus, this Bishop of Ephesus over the Province of Asia, the bishop of Carthage over the Province of Afric the bishops of <a id="l19"></a>Thessalonica  Simium Aquileia &amp; <a id="l20"></a>Millain over the Provinces  of those cities &amp; so of the rest<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l21"></a>Wherein this power of the Metropolitans over the bishops of their seve<a id="l22"></a>ral provinces consisted the Councel defined in the  two Canons next <a id="l23"></a>preceding, namely that a Bishop should be ordeined by all the bishops <a id="l24"></a>of the Province  (that is by a Provincial Council) or at least by three of them with the consent of the rest <a id="l25"></a>in writing, &amp; the firmness of the ordination should depend upon the <a id="l26"></a>Metropolitan in every Province. And that in every Province a Council of <a id="l27"></a>the bishops of the Province should also be celebrated  every spring &amp; autum. To the power <a id="l28"></a>of the metropolitan  over Ordination, &amp; his presiding in provincial Councils <a id="l29"></a>&amp;  convening them upon Ordinations &amp; such like extraordinary occasions, the Council seem to <a id="l30"></a>refer in saying Antiqua consuetudo servetur per Ægyptum Libyam &amp; Pen<a id="l31"></a>tapolim ita ut  Alexandrinus Episcopus horum omnium habeat potes<a id="l32"></a>tatem quia at Vrbis Romæ parilis mos est.

Such ordinations were incroached afterwards <a id="l159"></a>by the Bishops  of Rome &amp; Constantinople. In all the Diocess of Alexandria <a id="l160"></a>no bishop could be ordeined without the consent of the bishop of Alexandria &amp; those of his Council <a id="l161"></a>&amp; so of the Diocess of Antioch,  &amp; all the bishops ordeined by them <a id="l162"></a>attended their anniversary Councils.

Non enim, saith <a id="l165"></a>Pope Leo I, nobis ordinationes vestrarum Provinciarum defendimus, We do <a id="l166"></a>not arrogate to our selves a power of ordeining in your Provinces. This <a id="l167"></a>power  of Ordeining all the inferior bishops in their several diocesses the forreign <a id="l168"></a>Metopolitans preserved to themselves for many ages: but at length the Pope wrested <a id="l169"></a>this power also from them.

Nilus Doxapatrius  (who lived in the 11<sup>th</sup> century) in his book  partly published <a id="l178"></a>by Leo Allatius tells us that this Bishop  was over the Churches of the <a id="l179"></a>barbarians in  Chersonesus [Taurica] &amp; Chazaria &amp; Chaldia &amp; Gothia &amp; Abasgia &amp; Iberia <a id="l180"></a>&amp; Alania  [a large country upon the river Tanais] &amp; great Russia, &amp; sent them metropolitans; &amp; Balsamon [in <a id="l181"></a>Can 18 Concil.

Afterwards  <a id="l330"></a>Charles the great propagated the Roman religion into all Germany by conquest &amp; from thence it <a id="l331"></a>began at the same time to spread into Denmark Swedeland &amp; Poland.  The great Duke of Russia em<a id="l332"></a>braced the religion of the Greek Church about the year of Christ 989: but the Christian religion was <a id="l333"></a>spread there among the common people before. And now all the northern part of Europe  two <a id="l334"></a>fesses Christianity  &amp; has done so some hundreds of years. The Christian religion has been pro<a id="l335"></a>pagated also from Egypt  into Ethiopia above Egypt. But the Churches of those Ethiopians acknowledge themselves under the Church of <a id="l336"></a>Alexandria &amp; receive their Bishops from thence &amp; are some of them under the Turks &amp; in that respect may referred to Ægypt,  at least so far as they are considered in this Prophesy especially s<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>in<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>m<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>.  So then the Christian world which is the subject of this Prophesy <a id="l338"></a>consists of three parts, pretty equal to one another the Greek Empire, the Latine Empire &amp; the northern nations. And by <a id="l339"></a>this division you may know that by the third part of the earth sea rivers Sun Moon &amp; stars is <a id="l340"></a>meant the third part of this Christian world, or the  earth sea rivers Sun Moon &amp; stars of <a id="l341"></a>one of these three parts. As Israel is divided into twelve Tribes, so the Christian world which apostati<a id="l342"></a>ses to the worship of the Beast &amp; his Image is divided into these  three parts or Tribes.  And this unfolds to us the mystery <a id="l343"></a>of counting the number of the Beast. For the name &amp; number of the Beast  is opposed to <a id="l344"></a>the name of God &amp; to the number of his servants who stand on mount Sion with his name on their <a id="l345"></a>foreheads. And in that respect, the number of the Beast 666 is to be counted in the same manner <a id="l346"></a>as the number of God's servants  144000 was counted. This number was counted by multi<a id="l347"></a>plying 12000 by its divisor 12 the number of the tribes of Israel (Apoc 7 <span class="hspac-n" title="4 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) &amp; therefore <a id="l348"></a>666 is to be counted by multiplying some number by a divisor of that number. And there is <a id="l349"></a>but one way of counting it in this manner, which is by multiplying 222 by 3 the number of the <a id="l350"></a>tribes of them that worship the Beast.</p>
<p id="par20">The Empire of the Greeks was founded by Alexander the great &amp; represented by Daniels Leopard <a id="l351"></a>&amp; also by his Hee Goat  in the reign of the great horn &amp; in that of the four  succeeding horns as Daniel <a id="l352"></a>himself interprets both in the prophesy of this Goat &amp; in that of the Scripture of truth.  In  <a id="l353"></a>the reign of the little horn which succeeded them the Goat grew greater then ever but not in his own <a id="l354"></a>power. The power under which he grew mighty was that of the Romans. This horn waxed exceeding <a id="l355"></a>great towards the south &amp; towards the east &amp; therefore was a north west horn, the kingdom of Pergamus <a id="l356"></a>inherited by the Romans. From henceforward the Goat is the whole united Empire of Greeks &amp; <a id="l357"></a>Latines untill they separate.  And this separation begins with the division of the empire between <a id="l358"></a>Dioclesian &amp; Maximianus, is  advanced by the building of Constantinople for the Metropolis <a id="l359"></a>of the Greek Empire &amp; finished by the dividing of the Empire between Valentinian &amp; Valens, Gratian <a id="l360"></a>&amp; Theodosius, Honorius &amp; Arcadius reigning at Rome &amp; Constantinople. And by this division  the <a id="l361"></a>Nations through which the Christians world was diffused became  resolved into three parts the two Empires <a id="l362"></a>&amp; the northern nations as above.</p>
<p id="par21"> The lives of Daniel's three first Beasts were prolongued after their dominion was taken <a id="l363"></a>away &amp; all the four Beasts continued together alive untill a stone cut out of a mountain <a id="l364"></a>without hands fell upon the toes of Nebuchadnezzars Image &amp; brake in pieces the whole Image,  the gold <a id="l365"></a>the silver the brass &amp; the iron  representing the same four Monarchies with the Beasts . And therefore all the <a id="l366"></a> four Beasts are now in being.  The first &amp; second beyond the river Tigris are not yet converted to Christianity.  The third is the Greek Empire  erected by Alexander M. <a id="l367"></a>propagated through the Roman Empire, &amp; afterwards  separated &amp; seated at Constantinople &amp; now under the <a id="l368"></a>dominion of the Turks.  The fourth  is the Latin Empire first subduing devouring &amp; breaking into ten <a id="l369"></a>kingdoms &amp; still reigning in .  And the  two last Empires being Christian are repre<a id="l370"></a>sented by Iohns  Dragon &amp; ten horned Beast &amp; described by Iohn under those types so far as Daniels prophesies remained to be ful<a id="l371"></a>filled after Iohns days.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004v-a"> &lt;4v&gt; </span>  Iohns Dragon is the <a id="l378"></a>third Monarchy &amp; his  tenhorned Beast the fourth. When the two Empires are <a id="l379"></a>united &amp; considered as one monarchy they are represented in Daniel either by the fourth <a id="l380"></a>beast devouring &amp; breaking &amp; in pieces &amp; stamping upon the nations of the third or by the <a id="l381"></a>He Goat growing greater then ever in the reign of his last horn, but not in his own power <a id="l382"></a>This horn being higher &amp; greater then the first horn, includes both Empires, that of the Greeks which <a id="l383"></a>grew  mighty &amp; that of the  Latines in  whose power the Greeks grew mighty <a id="l384"></a>But after the  Greeks &amp;  Latines separated the Latines ceased <a id="l385"></a>to belong to the body of the Goat. And in like manner the Dragon signifies both Em<a id="l386"></a>pires together when they are united &amp; considered as one, but when they are divided <a id="l387"></a> the Dragon signifies only the Greek empire. And therefore upon the division of <a id="l388"></a>the Empire a ten horned Beast rises out of the sea  to respresent <a id="l389"></a>the Empire of the Latines.  This is Daniels fourth Beast, &amp; was in being <a id="l390"></a>before he rose out of the sea: for at his first rise he had all the Dragons heads &amp; yet <a id="l391"></a>five of them were fallen &amp; one of them was wounded to death with a sword &amp; the mortal <a id="l392"></a>wound was healed before he rose. But the two Empires being united when Iohn wrote &amp; <a id="l393"></a> Iohn takes no notice of the first rise of the Beast but considers him <a id="l394"></a>as latent in the Dragons body untill  by a new division of the Empire he rises out of <a id="l395"></a>the   sea;  &amp; receives the Dragons   old throne.</p>

This Goat represented the Greek Empire alone till the Latine Empire arises &amp; then it represented both together while they continue united And hence arises a division of the subject of the sacred prophesy <a id="l401"></a>of the new Testament into three parts, the nations of the Greek Empire <a id="l402"></a>the nations of the Latine Empire &amp; the northern nations of  Moscovy, Transylvania, Poland, Germany Swedelan<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>d<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Denmark Christian nations without the bounds <a id="l403"></a>of both Empires: all which together compose the body of the Christian world. <a id="l404"></a>This division into three parts became visible at may be recconed to  the division of the Empire <a id="l405"></a>between Dioclesian &amp; his Collegue Maximianus, &amp; more visible  at  the building <a id="l406"></a>of Constantinople for the Metropolis of the Eastern Empire &amp;  was comple<a id="l407"></a>ted by the  division of the  Empire between Valentinian &amp; Valens, Gratian &amp; <a id="l408"></a>Theodosius, Honorius &amp; Arcadius. And by this division you may know that  <a id="l409"></a> the  third part of the  earth, sea, Rivers, Sun <a id="l410"></a>Moon &amp; stars  signifies the earth, sea, Rivers Sun Moon &amp; Stars of the third part of <a id="l411"></a> the Christian world, that is, of one of the three parts above mentioned. As Israel is divide<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>d<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l412"></a>into twelve  Tribes so the people who worship the Beast &amp; his Image is divided into three parts of Tribes.</p>
<p id="par23">3. The Latine Empire being the  fourth Beast of Daniel or  4<sup>th</sup> Monarchy <a id="l413"></a>stricktly so called, was to stand till the judgement should sit &amp; the son of Man <a id="l414"></a>should come in the clouds to the ancient of days &amp; the saints should take <a id="l415"></a>the kingdom. The Greek Empire  being the third monarchy or third Beast  is still in being. For  <a id="l417"></a>the three first beasts or monarchies had their lives prolongued after their dominion <a id="l418"></a>was taken away, &amp; all four continued together in being untill a stone cut out of the mou<a id="l419"></a>ntain without hands fell upon the toes of the Image &amp; brake the   whole image  to pieces. This third Monarchy comprehending the nations of Greece <a id="l421"></a>Asia Syria &amp; Egypt was represented  at first – – – – – – reigning at Constantinople till <a id="l422"></a>the Turks subdued it, &amp; is still alive under the dominion of the Turks. And while <a id="l423"></a>Daniels Beasts are still alive &amp; the Prophesies of Daniel &amp; Iohn were given by one <a id="l424"></a>&amp; the same Holy Ghost: we may conclude that the Beasts in Iohn's Prophesy have <a id="l425"></a>relation to the Beasts in Daniel's prophesies &amp;  that as Daniel has in several Prophesies represented  the same monarchies <a id="l428"></a>under several types &amp; described them again &amp; again  in several  manners so <a id="l429"></a>that the several prophesies being compared together may illustrate one ano<a id="l430"></a>ther &amp; be taken joyntly as one Prophesy several times repeated: so Iohn has represented the same monarchies under new types  &amp; <a id="l431"></a>described them again after a new manner so far as they remained <a id="l432"></a>to be fulfilled when Iohn wrote,  so that the prophesies of Daniel &amp; <a id="l433"></a>Iohn being compared together may illustrate one another &amp; be taken joyntly as <a id="l434"></a>one complete prophesy. For even Iohn has  described the same things <a id="l435"></a>again &amp; again in various manners, &amp; his descriptions wherever they synchronise <a id="l436"></a>must be compared together  that they may illustrate one another &amp; make one <a id="l437"></a>complete prophesy. These repeated descriptions of the same things in various manners <a id="l438"></a>by Daniel &amp; Iohn &amp; the other Prophets were designed to obscure the prophesies <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> till the time of the end, &amp; then to make the interpretation plane &amp; sure <a id="l439"></a>And therefore Interpreters are to compare the prophesies one with another as <a id="l440"></a>far as they can be compared &amp; to reconcile them &amp; adjust them to one another as far <a id="l441"></a>as they can be adjusted without straining, &amp; to find out their meaning by comparing <a id="l442"></a>reconciling &amp; adjusting them together; &amp; those Interpretations are always to be preferred <a id="l443"></a>which are best supported by the analogy of scripture &amp; without straining reduce the prophesies to the greatest harmony &amp; simplicity. For the <a id="l444"></a>Apocalyps is very full of Allusions to the prophesies of the old Testament &amp; these allusions <a id="l445"></a>are to direct interpreters to compare the prophesies in order to interpret them</p>

But the next year Philippicus being dead, Peter was received into Rome upon an oath that he would consult their  welfare. After this in the year 726 the Emperor Leo Isaurus to put a stop to the worship of Images called a  meeting of Councellours &amp; Bishops in his Palace &amp; by their advice put out an edict against that worship &amp; wrote to Pope Gregory the second that a general Council might be <a id="l930"></a>called. But the Pope thereupon calling a Council at Rome confirmed the worship of Images excommunicated the Greek Emperor &amp; absolved his subjects in Italy from their allegiance &amp; absolved the people of Italy <a id="l931"></a>from their allegiance &amp; forbad them to pay tribute or otherwise to be obedient to him <a id="l932"></a> &amp; the  people of Rome &amp; Campania  &amp;  Ravenna &amp; the <a id="l933"></a>Pentapolitans revolted &amp;  laid violent hands upon their magistrates, killing the Exarch Paul at <a id="l934"></a>Ravenna, &amp; blinding Peter at Rome, &amp;   when Exhileratus Duke of Campania <a id="l935"></a>incited the people against the Pope  the Romans  invaded Campania &amp; slew him with his son <a id="l936"></a>Hadrian.

Thus Rome with its Dutchy  including part of  Tuscia &amp; campania <a id="l942"></a>revolted &amp;  became a free state under the government of the Senate of  the City.

And tho it was not so <a id="l1008"></a>great dominion as that of the Exarchate or  that of the Lombards, yet it was  in some <a id="l1009"></a>respects as considerable.

It was allowed by its enemies the Pope &amp; Emperor to have the power of making an Emperor: which was a greater power then that of  the other kingdoms. It was very lasting: for <a id="l1011"></a>its government by a senate continued  first under the western Emperors then under the <a id="l1012"></a>Ostrogoths, afterwards under the Exarch &amp; then in a free state till the Pope subjected <a id="l1013"></a>it to  Charles the great after which <a id="l1014"></a>time the senate &amp; people of Rome maintained their civil rights in some measure against the Pope till  the year <a id="l1015"></a>1460 or longer.

And this state she began to enter into  upon the divi<a id="l1507"></a>sion of the Empire between the sons of Constantine. For then the  Bishop of Rome became universall bishop over the churches of the western empire.</p>
<p id="par113">For in the year 341 he received appeals from Councils of the Greek church &amp; proudly <a id="l1509"></a>summoned the Bishops of that   Church to appear before him in a Council <a id="l1510"></a>at Rome [ by which act he claimed appeals from all the Churches &amp; made himself <a id="l1511"></a>universal Bishop ] but  was stotly opposed &amp; reprimanded by those bishops for his  ambition Then he prevailed to <a id="l1513"></a>have a Council summoned by Imperial authority out of both Empires to meet at <a id="l1514"></a>Serdica in the year 347.  About 80 eastern Bishops came to Serdica,  but <a id="l1515"></a>finding that matters were prejudged by the western Bishops in favour of the pre<a id="l1516"></a>tended authority  of the Bishop of Rome, they went back; &amp; then the remaining <a id="l1517"></a>part of the Council composed of western &amp; Egyptian bishops decreed appeals <a id="l1518"></a>from all the Churches to the Bishop of Rome, &amp; thereby  gave him the supremacy over all the west. For the western churches submitted <a id="l1520"></a>to that decree. And these proceedings almost made a schism between churches of the two <a id="l1521"></a> Empires the people of the  western churches beginning now to avoid the communion <a id="l1522"></a>of the Eastern but those of the eastern not yet avoiding the communion of the western. <a id="l1523"></a>And this tendency to a schism is  represented by the endeavour of the flood to carry away <a id="l1524"></a>the woman. <sup>⊕</sup>⊕ And as the dominion of the Church of Rome in the wilderness is represented by her sitting upon many waters so in her way into <a id="l1525"></a>the wilderness it is represented by her floating upon the flood. Thus did the Woman soon after she had received two Wings of a great Eagle, begin to fly into <a id="l1526"></a>the wilderness. For the western Churches headed by the Pope are the woman in the wilderness</p>
<p id="par114"> But the force of the flood to carry away the Woman was but of short continuance <a id="l1527"></a>For Magnentius slew Constans  &amp; succeeded him in the west A.C. 350 &amp; within a <a id="l1528"></a>year or two was conquered by Constantius.
