And so the desolation of Israel is repre<a id="l3"></a>sented by a Chaos. <em class="underline">I beheld</em>, saith Ieremy, <em class="underline">the earth &amp; lo it <a id="l4"></a>was without form &amp; void, &amp; the heavens &amp; they had no light. <a id="l5"></a>I beheld the mountains &amp; they trembled. – For thus saith <a id="l6"></a>the Lord the whole land shall be desolate.</em> Ier. 4.23. So where <a id="l7"></a>Isaiah saith, <em class="underline">Hear o heavens &amp; give ear o earth</em> (ch. 1.2) again <em class="underline">Sing o ye heavens, shout ye lower parts of the earth, break forth into singing ye mountains, O forrest &amp; every tree therein</em> (Ch. 44.23, &amp; 49.13 <em class="underline">Let the world hear</em>. ch. 34.1. he <a id="l8"></a>speaks to a world which can hear &amp; sing that is, to a world politick. <a id="l9"></a>And so the ruin of Idumea (by which the Iews understand the Ro<a id="l10"></a>man  Empire) he describes by the heavens rolling away as a scroll <a id="l11"></a>&amp; their host dissolving &amp; falling down &amp; the mountains melting <a id="l12"></a>with blood &amp; the rivers turning into burning pitch &amp; the dry land into <a id="l13"></a>burning brimstone (chap. 34) All this is a  world politick ruined by war: ffor, saith he, <em class="underline">my sword shall be bathed <a id="l14"></a>in heaven it shall come down</em> [from thence] <em class="underline">upon Idumea, the people of my <a id="l15"></a>curse, to judgment: the sword of the Lord is filled with blood</em> &amp;c. So <a id="l16"></a>also where Debora saith: <em class="underline">They fought from heaven, the stars in their <a id="l17"></a>courses fought against Sisera</em> (Iud. 5.20)  <a id="l18"></a>&amp; Moses describes the desolation of Israel by a conflagration of <a id="l19"></a>the Earth (Deut. 32.22:) the heaven &amp; starrs &amp; earth are men. <a id="l20"></a>ffor nothing is more usual then by the earth to understand the <a id="l21"></a>nations of the earth, as in these expressions: <em class="underline">Let the earth rejoyce</em> <a id="l22"></a>(Psal 97.1) <em class="underline">He causeth the earth &amp;  them that dwell therein <a id="l23"></a>to worship the first Beast</em> Apoc. 13.2 And the same language is also <a id="l24"></a>applied to the heavens. <em class="underline">Rejoyce ye heavens &amp; ye that dwell in <a id="l25"></a>them: wo to the inhabiters of the earth &amp; of the sea</em>. Apoc 12.12. <a id="l26"></a>Thus also in the first four Trumpets where the earth &amp; <a id="l27"></a>Sea &amp; Rivers &amp; Sun Moon &amp; Stars are gradually smitten, (Apoc. 8) it de<a id="l28"></a>notes the smiting of  a world politique by the wars of those <a id="l29"></a>Trumpets. And where Iohn saith, <em class="underline">I saw a new heaven &amp; new <a id="l30"></a>earth, for the first heaven &amp; first earth were passed away</em> (Apoc. 21) <a id="l31"></a>&amp; Peter after he had described a conflagration of the old heaven <a id="l32"></a>&amp; earth subjoyns: <em class="underline">Nevertheless we  according to his promise look <a id="l33"></a>for new heavens &amp; a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness</em> <a id="l34"></a>(2 Pet. 3.13:) the old &amp; new heavens &amp; earths are old &amp; new worlds <a id="l35"></a>politique. ffor the promise which Peter refers to is this. <em class="underline">Behold I create <a id="l36"></a>new heavens &amp; a new earth &amp; the former shall not be remembred <a id="l37"></a>nor come into mind: but be ye glad &amp; rejoyce for ever in that <a id="l38"></a>which I create, for behold I create Ierusalem a rejoycing &amp; her people a joy – &amp; the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her – &amp; they shall build houses &amp; inhabit them &amp; they shall plant vineyards &amp; eat the fruit of them</em>, &amp; dye <em class="underline">an hundred <a id="l39"></a>years old</em>, &amp;c. Isa 65.17, 18, 20, 21.  [And whilst the <a id="l40"></a>world natural with its severall parts is put for a world politick or <a id="l41"></a>great kingdom, its very proper to represent the end of such a  kingdom by the <a id="l42"></a>end of the world: &amp; accordingly we find in the new Testament <a id="l43"></a>the end of the world at Christs second coming frequently put for <a id="l44"></a>the end of that  great body politick represented  in Daniel by the four <a id="l45"></a>Monarchies: which figurative way of speaking not being understood by <a id="l46"></a>the  common people, they have framed a notion as if the world <a id="l47"></a>natural should then be at an end. And yet there is nothing more <a id="l48"></a> usual in scripture then to put the world for a great body of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> men, as in these  places. Augustus Cesar taxed all the world <a id="l49"></a>Luke 2.1. All the world wondered after the Beast Apoc. 13.2. The great <a id="l50"></a>Dragon was cast out which deceiveth the whole world Apoc 12.9.  These have turned the world upside down Acts 17.6. <a id="l52"></a>Ye are the light of the world Mat 5.14 The world is gone after <a id="l53"></a>him Iohn 12.19. The world lyeth in wickedness 1 Iohn 5.19 The sins <a id="l54"></a>of the world Iohn 1 29. The saviour of the world Iohn 4.42.  The <a id="l55"></a>Wisdome of this world 1 Cor. 3.19. The Prince of this world Iohn 14.30. And <a id="l56"></a>that the end of the world is a phrase of the same kind with these is <a id="l57"></a>evident because after that revolution there still continues a <a id="l58"></a>race of mortalls on earth,  as may appear by comparing <a id="l59"></a>Apoc 10.6, 7 with ch.11.15, 18. See also ch 20.8, 9 &amp; ch 21.1, 24, 26 &amp; Dan 7.26, <a id="l60"></a>27  compared with Dan 12. See also Isa 51.5, 6, 11. &amp; 54.8, 9, 10 &amp; 60.20, 21 &amp; 66.22 &amp; Ier 31.33, 36 &amp; 33.20, 21 <a id="l61"></a>25, 26, &amp; Ezek 37.25. &amp; Amos 9 14, 15. &amp; Ioel 3.12, 20.]</p>

Isa. 29.9, 11, 13.

And as for the earth, there is nothing more usual then to understand the nations by it as in these expressions. Let  the earth  rejoyce. Psal. 97.1. He causeth the earth &amp; them that dwell therein to worship the first Beast. Apoc. 13.2. Whence Moses describes the desolation of Israel by a conflagration of the earth Deut. 32</p>
<p id="par11">2. This signification of heaven &amp; earth is further confirmed by <a id="l171"></a>the significations of ascending &amp; descending. <em class="underline">Thou hast said in thine <a id="l172"></a>heart: I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above <a id="l173"></a>the stars of God, I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in <a id="l174"></a>the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds</em>, &amp;c. <a id="l175"></a>This is spoken of the King of Babylon exalting himself above all Kings <a id="l176"></a>&amp; earthly dominions Isa. 14.13. <em class="underline">Thy greatness, O Nebuchadnezzar, is <a id="l177"></a>grown &amp; reatcheth unto the heaven</em> Dan. 4.22.

For this kind of language was familiar to the ancient orientall nations. If a king <em class="underline">If a King <a id="l180"></a>see himself, as it were, above the heaven where the stars are, he shal <a id="l181"></a>find exaltation &amp; a name above other Kings.</em> Achm. c. 162. ex. Ind. Pers. <a id="l182"></a>Æg. By all which it may appear that heaven signifies any high &amp; exalted estate <a id="l183"></a>&amp; earth a low one. </p>
<p id="par12">3. And whilst ascending &amp; descending signifies rising &amp; falling in <a id="l184"></a>honour &amp; power all other local motion in the world natural must sig<a id="l185"></a>nify  suitable translation from one office dignity condition &amp; station <a id="l186"></a>to another in the world politick.  So in Isaiah 22, the captivating of  Shebna governor of the  Temple is termed driving him from his station or (as the Chalde Paraphrast renders it) from his place, &amp; the substituting Eliakim into his Office &amp; afterwards  deposing him iscompared to the fastening of a nail in a sure place &amp; the removing of that nail. So if if mountains or or sands or Candle<a id="l187"></a>sticks be moved out of their places it signifies their being translated <a id="l188"></a>from their former dominion dignity or condition. And when the woman flees <a id="l189"></a>into the wilderness to her place prepared of God she flees to her place <a id="l190"></a>of honour &amp; reigning therein. Apoc. 12. So Isaiah puts a place &amp; name in House of God for a dignity or office there ch 56.5 ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the right margin of f 5r &gt; </span> ✝ And when we say that Christ sits at the right hand of God we meane that he is next to God in dignity<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 5r resumes &gt; </span> ffor this language of putting places for Offices &amp; dignities is familiar even to the western nations.</p>
<p id="par13">4.  So shaking the parts of the world natural signifies the shaking of the  analogous parts of the world politick <em class="underline">If a King dram that there is an earthquake in his city or land <a id="l191"></a>it portends war of nations &amp; conspiracy against him.</em>  This is the doctrine of the Indians, Persians &amp; Egyptians recorded by Achmet c. 144.  And in scripture earthquakes &amp; shaking of heaven and <a id="l193"></a>earth signify  such a shaking as to overthrow kingdoms: as in Isaiah, <em class="underline">I will camp against thee round about, &amp; <a id="l194"></a>I will lay seige against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against <a id="l195"></a>thee &amp; thou shalt be brought down – thou shalt be visited of the Lord of hosts <a id="l196"></a>with thunder &amp; with earthquake &amp; with great noise</em> Isa. 29.3, 6. And where Haggai
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span>
saith, <em class="underline">Yet once more &amp; I will shake the heavens &amp; the earth</em>, Paul gives <a id="l197"></a>this interpretation, <em class="underline">This yet once more signifies the removing of those <a id="l198"></a>things that are shaken</em>.</p>
<p id="par14">5.

The scriptures <a id="l240"></a>in like manner refer the Moon to the Queen &amp; Venus or the Morning <a id="l241"></a>Star to the Prince next the King. ffor Lucifer in Isaiah (ch. 14.12) <a id="l242"></a>is put for the King of Babylon, suppose in respect of the King of hea<a id="l243"></a>ven; &amp; in the Apocalyps for Christ, suppose in respect of God the ffather. <a id="l244"></a>And when Ioseph dreamed that the Sun Moon &amp; eleven Stars should do <a id="l245"></a>obeysance to him, Iacob interprets it of himself his wife &amp; ele<a id="l246"></a>ven sons comparing his family to a little Kingdom, &amp; his wife as <a id="l247"></a>Queen to the Moon. Whenever Christ is represented by the Sun (as in <a id="l248"></a>Malachy where he is called the sun of righteousness, &amp; in the <a id="l249"></a>Apocalyps where his face is as the sun,) 'tis to denote him King, &amp; <a id="l250"></a>then the Church being his wife or Queen is the Moon &amp; the Bishops <a id="l251"></a>are the Stars. So in the beginning of the Apocalyps where his face <a id="l252"></a>is as the Sun, the seven stars are put for the Angels or Bishops of <a id="l253"></a>the Churches, &amp; of the same kind are those stars which the Goat in Daniel, &amp; the  dragon in Iohn, cast down from heaven. In Apoc. 19 an Angel standing in the Sun is put for the ruling part or Clergy of Christ's  Kingdom,  cloathed with the regal authority of Christ. For Angels in this Prophesy are mystical bodies of Bishops &amp; Bishops are Kings &amp; Priests as Melchizedeck was. In Apoc 12 you <a id="l254"></a>may conceive the Sun wherewith the woman in heaven is cloathed <a id="l255"></a>to be Christ walking in the midst of the Candlesticks or Churches, <a id="l256"></a>her crown of twelve Stars to be the Bishops set over her, the Moon <a id="l257"></a>under her feet to be the illuminated body of inferior Christians, <a id="l258"></a>that is the Church of the Laity spiritually illuminated by her teachers <a id="l259"></a>&amp; governours, &amp; the woman her self to be the illuminateing body of <a id="l260"></a>Superior Christians or the body of the Clergy who teach &amp; govern. <a id="l261"></a>ffor they are the light of the world, the shining body of Christ <a id="l262"></a>whereby the rest are illuminated. And as the Moon here signifies <a id="l263"></a>the inferior people who are enlightened &amp; governed, &amp; the Sun com<a id="l264"></a>prehends the more glorious body of governours, so in any other <a id="l265"></a>kingdom the King &amp; people may be considered as Lord &amp; wife or Sun &amp; Moon. ffor at <a id="l266"></a>the opening of the sixt seale Apoc. 6.12, the Moon which there became <a id="l267"></a>as blood is called <em class="underline">the whole Moon</em> to shew that she is composed of a <a id="l268"></a>multitude.

My determination is to assemble the Kingdoms to pour upon them mine indignation even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy Zeph 3.8. So also  Moses describes the desolation of Israel &amp; Peter the ruin of the Kingdoms of the world by a conflagration of  the earth (Deut. 32.22 2 Pet 3.10.) &amp; the wars whereby mankind is kept out of Paradise  Moses signifies by Cherubims (which are armies) with the flame of a sword  which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life Gen. 3.24. <em class="underline">The strength of the bat<a id="l347"></a>tel – hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not it burned <a id="l348"></a>him, yet he laid it not to heart</em> Isa. 42.25. <em class="underline">The Lord called <a id="l349"></a>thy name a green olive tree – with the noise of a great tumult <a id="l350"></a>he hath kindled a fire upon it</em> Ier. 11.16.

<p id="par23">The Chalde Paraphrast for burning substitutes slaying Isa. <a id="l352"></a>42.25 &amp; for fire &amp; flame armies of enemies strong &amp; powerful <a id="l353"></a>as fire Ier. 11.16 &amp; 48.45 &amp;c. Also for flame he puts a sword. Isa. 50.11.</p>
<p id="par24"><em class="underline">If one dream that he is burnt by a flame he shal perish in war</em> <a id="l354"></a>Achm. 159 ex mente Ind. <em class="underline">If a King seem to see the pillars of his palace <a id="l355"></a>on fire, it signifies the dominion of another &amp; the destruction of <a id="l356"></a>the great ones which he hath constituted – And if he see his hair <a id="l357"></a>on fire he shall loose his people in war</em> c. 160 ex  Pers. et <a id="l358"></a>Ægypt. <em class="underline">If one dream that the Sun hath scorched him much he will be <a id="l359"></a>punished by the King proportionally to the scorching</em> Ind. Pers. &amp; Ægypt. <a id="l360"></a>in Achm. c. 167. This respects a single person. Where a nation or people <a id="l361"></a>is scorched by the Sun the punishment can scarce be any otherwise  <a id="l362"></a>then by the King making war upon them, or raising a persecution a<a id="l363"></a>gainst them.

<p id="par25">10 That a cloud is a multitude may appear by these instances. <em class="underline">Thou</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">shalt ascend &amp; come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the <a id="l376"></a>land thou &amp; all thy bands &amp; many people with thee</em>, Ezek. 38.9. <em class="underline">A day of <a id="l377"></a>darkness, &amp; gloominess, a day of clouds, a great people &amp; a strong &amp;c</em> <a id="l378"></a>Ioel. 2.2. <em class="underline">A cloud shal cover Egypt &amp; her daughters shal go into cap<a id="l379"></a>tivity</em>. i.e. a cloud of enemies or as the Chalde Paraphrast interprets it <a id="l380"></a>a King with his army like a cloud Ezek 30.18. And so God threatning the overthrow of Pharaoh by Nebuchadnezzar, saith: <em class="underline">&amp; when I shall put thee out – I will  cover the sun with a cloud</em> &amp; set <em class="underline">darkness upon thy land</em>:  that is saith the Chalde Paraphrast <em class="underline">A King with his Army shall cover thee as a cloud ascends &amp; covers the Sun</em>, Ezek. 32.7. The like signification of smoke see in Isa. 14.31 &amp; Apoc 9.2. In these instances a cloud signifies only numerous armies, but its signification equally ex<a id="l381"></a>tends to any great multitude as may appear out of Heb. 12.1: <em class="underline">Wherefore <a id="l382"></a>seing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses</em> &amp;c.: <a id="l383"></a>which expression now grown proverbial was doubtless derived from the <a id="l384"></a>language of the ancient Prophets &amp; wise men; or at least from the same <a id="l385"></a>grounds from which they derived it: which I take to be chiefly the resem<a id="l386"></a>blance which a numerous swarm of insects, as also the dust raised by <a id="l387"></a>a great multitude of people, have to a cloud.</p>
<p id="par26">Hence riding on a cloud signifies reigning over people. <em class="underline">If a King <a id="l388"></a>dream that he sits upon the clouds carried whither he will, he shal rule <a id="l389"></a>over his enemies &amp; obtain victories &amp; unexpected joy</em> Pers. &amp; Ægypt <a id="l390"></a>in Achm. c. 164. So descending &amp; ascending in a cloud is descending and ascending in a multitude. Apoc. 10.1, &amp; 11.12.</p>
<p id="par27">11.   Clouds being people, the winds with arise from their commotion must signify the commotion &amp; wars of one nation against another in the quarter of the wind. Thus <em class="underline">the</em> <em class="underline">four winds of heaven strove upon the sea.</em> i.e. the wars of nations whereby <a id="l391"></a>the Beasts arose. Dan. 9.1. <em class="underline">The wind shall eat up all thy pastures &amp; thy <a id="l392"></a>lovers shall go into captivity</em> Ier. 22.22. <em class="underline">I will raise up against Babylon <a id="l393"></a>– a destroying wind</em> Ier. 51.1. <em class="underline">Vpon Elam will I bring the four winds from <a id="l394"></a>the four quarters of heaven &amp; will scatter them towards all those <a id="l395"></a>winds, &amp; there shall be no Nation whether the outcasts of Elam shall <a id="l396"></a>not come. ffor I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies</em>. <a id="l397"></a>Ier. 49.36. <em class="underline">The wind shall carry them away &amp; the whirlewind shall <a id="l398"></a>scatter them</em>. Isa 41.16. <em class="underline">I scattered them with a whirlwind among <a id="l399"></a>all the nations</em> Zech. 7.14. <em class="underline">The king of the north shall come against him with <a id="l400"></a>a whirlwind, with chariots</em> &amp;c.

<p id="par28"><em class="underline">If a King see the sea much troubled by wind from a known quarter <a id="l406"></a>he will be molested by some nations from that quarter, but if he see the sea <a id="l407"></a>calm he will peaceably enjoy his kingdom</em> Ind.

<p id="par29">12. Thunder is the voice of a cloud &amp; therefore signifies the voice of a mul<a id="l413"></a>titude. In allusions to the loud noise of Drums &amp; Trumpets it signifies <a id="l414"></a>a battel with victory on that side which thunders. So lightning is fire, &amp; <a id="l415"></a>fire is war: and hail (in allusion to the stroke of weapons) is also the <a id="l416"></a>tempest of a battel, as you may see by these instances.  <em class="underline">The Lord thundred in the heavens &amp; the highest gave his voice: Hailstones <a id="l418"></a>&amp; coals of fire.

So <a id="l433"></a>Ioel describing the battel of the great day saith, <em class="underline">The Lord shall roar <a id="l434"></a>out of Zion</em>, i.e. Thunder with a roaring thunder ch. 3.16. And in the <a id="l435"></a>same sense are thunder lightning &amp; hail constantly used in the Apo<a id="l436"></a>caplys ch. 8.6, 7 &amp; 11.19 &amp; 16.18, 21.</p>
<p id="par30"><em class="underline">If one dream that hail falls on a place he may expect a violent <a id="l437"></a>incursion of the enemy; &amp; if he dream that the hail hurt the stalks of corn</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013r"> &lt;13r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">there shall be slaughter of men in that place proportional to the breaking <a id="l438"></a>of the stalks</em> Achm. c. 191, ex Ind.

Pers. &amp; <a id="l441"></a>Ægypt.</p>
<p id="par31">As for the mixing fire with hail, Apoc. 8.6 that figure may seem borrowed <a id="l442"></a>from the Ægyptian plague of thunder &amp; hail with fire mingled exod. 9 <a id="l443"></a>23. But I suppose it alludes also to the frequent mixture of hail <a id="l444"></a>with lightning which happens in hot countries, although in our northern <a id="l445"></a>regions it is less usuall.</p>
<p id="par32">An overflowing rain refers also to war as you may see by this <a id="l446"></a>instance. <em class="underline">I will call for a sword against him throughout all my moun<a id="l447"></a>tains – &amp; I will rain upon him &amp; upon his bands, &amp; upon the many <a id="l448"></a>people that are with him an overflowing rain &amp; great hailstones, fire &amp; <a id="l449"></a>brimstone.</em> Ezek. 38.22. ffor overflowing waters signify invading people as shall be presently explained. ‡ But moderate rain – – – <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 13v &gt; </span>‡ But moderate rain &amp; dew &amp; water  whereby vegetables &amp; <a id="l450"></a>animals are nourished called living water &amp; water of life, signify the graces &amp; <a id="l451"></a>gifts of the holy spirit &amp; doctrine of truth whereby men are nourished <a id="l452"></a>to everlasting life. <em class="underline">My doctrine shall  drop as rain, my speech <a id="l453"></a>shall distill as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender  herb &amp; as <a id="l454"></a>the showers upon the grass</em>.

<p id="par36">The bitterness of waters signifies  affliction of the people <a id="l511"></a>&amp; that also chiefly by war &amp; persecution.

And so in the Apocalyps the great star burning as it were <a id="l534"></a>a Lamp (that is consuming by war) is called wormwood, &amp; the <a id="l535"></a>waters on which it falls (that is the people) are said to become worm<a id="l536"></a>wood to express their bitter affliction by those wars &amp; many men <a id="l537"></a>are said to dye of the bitterness of those waters to express the disso<a id="l538"></a>lution of one or more bodies politique of men by those wars Apoc. 8.11.</p>
<p id="par37">When a prophesy refers (as is usual to more kingdoms then one <a id="l539"></a>the land &amp; waters are put for the people of several regions &amp; domi<a id="l540"></a>nions. So in the above cited place of Ezekiel where God threatens to <a id="l541"></a>rain upon Gog &amp; his people with an overflowing rain, this rain &amp; the  <a id="l542"></a>earth which it overflows, are  the army of Gog &amp; <a id="l544"></a>the  people of Israel invaded by that army.

<span class="pagenumber" id="p014r-b"> &lt;14r&gt; </span>
<p id="par41">In Ier. 57.42 the kingdom of Babylon is compared to the earth &amp; <a id="l556"></a>that of the Medes to the sea overflowing it by an invasion. <em class="underline">How is Babylon</em>, <a id="l557"></a>saith he, <em class="underline">become an astonishment among the nations! the sea</em> (i.e. the <a id="l558"></a>kingdom of the Medes) <em class="underline">is come upon Babylon, she is covered with the mul<a id="l559"></a>titude of the waves thereof her cities are a desolation &amp;c.</em> So in Isa. <a id="l560"></a>8.7, the kingdom of Iudah is represented by the earth &amp; that of Assyria <a id="l561"></a>by an overflowing River. <em class="underline">Behold the Lord bringeth upon them the waters <a id="l562"></a>of the River strong &amp; many, even the King of Assyria &amp; all his glory; <a id="l563"></a>&amp; he shall come up over all his channels &amp; go over all his banks, &amp; <a id="l564"></a>he shall pass through Iudah, he shall overflow &amp; go over, he shall <a id="l565"></a>reach even to the neck,</em>  And in Ier. 46.8. Egypt is a swelling <a id="l566"></a>flood &amp; other nations are the earth, <em class="underline">Egypt riseth up like a flood &amp; <a id="l567"></a>his waters are moved like the river, &amp; he saith, I will go up and <a id="l568"></a>will cover the earth, I will destroy the city &amp; the inhabitants thereof.</em> <a id="l569"></a>And in Ier 47.2 the like representation is made of a Northern <a id="l570"></a>Nation invading Philistia. <em class="underline">Behold waters</em> [that is, saith the Chalde Para<a id="l571"></a>phrast, peoples] <em class="underline">rise up out of the north &amp; shall be an overflowing <a id="l572"></a>flood, &amp; the inhabitants of the land shall howl at the noise of the hoofes <a id="l573"></a>of his strong horses &amp;c.</em> And to the same purpose you may see Isa. <a id="l574"></a>28.17 &amp; 30.28. So then Seas &amp; Rivers within their banks are <a id="l575"></a>kingdoms within their own countries, but when they overflow they <a id="l576"></a>are invaders of the neighbouring earth. And the like signification <a id="l577"></a>&amp; distinction of the earth &amp; waters is observed in the Apocalyps <a id="l578"></a>where the nations are distinguished into the inhabitants of the earth <a id="l579"></a>&amp; sea, ch. 12, &amp; the Angel sets his right food on the sea, &amp; his left <a id="l580"></a>foot on the earth ch. 10; &amp; the four winds hurt the earth at the sound<a id="l581"></a>ing of the first Trumpet, &amp; the Sea at the sounding of the second, &amp; <a id="l582"></a>the ten horned Beast rises out of the sea &amp; the two horned out of the <a id="l583"></a>earth. This earth &amp; sea is the Kingdoms of the Dragon &amp; Beast. <a id="l584"></a>While the Beast is one entire kingdom he is represented by the sea, <a id="l585"></a>but after his division into the ten kingdoms signified by his horns he <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015"> &lt;15r&gt; </span> is called the Rivers at the sounding of the third Trumpet, &amp; the many <a id="l586"></a>waters in the wilderness. And so the flood which the Dragon cast out <a id="l587"></a>of his mouth since it is a body of water divided from the Dragons <a id="l588"></a>body it must signify a kingdom split out of his kingdom by the <a id="l589"></a>division thereof.</p>
<p id="par42">Now as overflowing of waters signifies excess of power &amp; <a id="l590"></a>people &amp; invasion of other kingdoms, so drying up of waters sig<a id="l591"></a>nifies the decay of military strength &amp; the access of the regions of <a id="l592"></a>the waters to the dominions of the earth. <em class="underline">They shall draw their <a id="l593"></a>swords against Egypt – &amp; I will make the rivers dry &amp; sell the land <a id="l594"></a>into the hand of the wicked</em> Ezek. 30.12. <em class="underline">The Egyptians will I <a id="l595"></a>give over into the hand of a cruel Lord – &amp; the waters shal fail <a id="l596"></a>from the sea, &amp; the rivers shall be wasted &amp; dryed up – &amp; the <a id="l597"></a>brooks of defence shall be emptied &amp; dryed up, &amp; the reeds and <a id="l598"></a>flaggs shall wither</em> Isa. 19.5, 6. <em class="underline">A sword is upon the treasures <a id="l599"></a>of Babylon &amp; they shall be robbed, a draught is upon her wa<a id="l600"></a>ters &amp; they shall be dried up.</em> Ier 50.38. <em class="underline">I will dry up her <a id="l601"></a>Sea &amp; make her springs dry &amp; she shall become heaps, an <a id="l602"></a>astonishment without an inhabitant</em>. Ier. 51.36, 37. And in <a id="l603"></a>the same sense is the water of the great river Euphrates (that <a id="l604"></a>is of the kingdoms seated upon it) dried up that the way of the <a id="l605"></a>king of the east may be prepared Apoc. 16; &amp; also the <a id="l606"></a>water of the red sea &amp; rivers of Egypt to make way for <a id="l607"></a>the return of Israel from captivity. <em class="underline">The Lord shall utterly <a id="l608"></a>destroy the tongue of the Egyptian Sea &amp; with his mighty wind</em> <a id="l609"></a>[of war] <em class="underline">shall he shake his hand over the River</em> [Nile] <em class="underline">&amp; shall <a id="l610"></a>smite it in the seven streams &amp; make men go over dry shod. <a id="l611"></a>And there shall be an high way for the remnant of his people <a id="l612"></a>which shall be left from Assyria, like as it was to Israel in the day <a id="l613"></a>that he came up out of the land of Egypt</em>. Isa. 11.15, 16.</p>
<p id="par43">The like is to be understood of springs &amp; fountains, as in <a id="l614"></a>Hosea where Samaria is called a fountain dryed up. <em class="underline">Though Ephraim</em> <a id="l615"></a>saith he, <em class="underline">be fruitfull among his brethren, an East wind</em> [or war <a id="l616"></a>from the east] <em class="underline">shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the <a id="l617"></a>wilderness, &amp; his spring shall become dry &amp; his fountain shall <a id="l618"></a>be dried up – Samaria shall become desolate, for she hath rebelled</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">against her God, they shall fall by the sword</em> &amp;c. Hos. 13.15, 16.</p>
<p id="par44">14. Mountains because height is a type of dominion are the cities, <a id="l619"></a>which beare rule, &amp; plains the lower people. Of Ierusalems being <a id="l620"></a>called a Mountain there are many instances, as in Zech. 8.3. <a id="l621"></a><em class="underline">Ierusalem shall be called a city of truth &amp; the mountain of the <a id="l622"></a>Lord of Hosts the holy mountain</em>: &amp; in Dan 9.16. <em class="underline">Let thy fury be <a id="l623"></a>turned away from thy city Ierusalem thy holy mountain.</em> The <a id="l624"></a>like in Dan 9.20, Ier. 17.3, Isa 27.13 &amp; 66.10, &amp; other places <a id="l625"></a>&amp; also where the mountain of Gods house is put for Mount Zion <a id="l626"></a>&amp; Zion for Ierusalem.</p>
<p id="par45">So of Babylon: <em class="underline">I will render unto Babylon – all the evil that <a id="l627"></a>they have done in Zion – Behold I am against thee O destroying <a id="l628"></a>Mountain saith the Lord, which destroyeth all the earth; &amp; I will <a id="l629"></a>stretch out mine hand upon thee &amp; roll thee down from the rocks, <a id="l630"></a>&amp; will make thee a burnt mountain – thou shalt be desolate <a id="l631"></a>for ever</em> Ier. 51. 24, 25, 26. <em class="underline">Who art thou O great mountain? <a id="l632"></a>before Zerubbabel, thou shalt become a plain</em> Zech. 4.7. <em class="underline">The burden <a id="l633"></a>of Babylon which Isaias the son of Amos did see: lift ye up a ban<a id="l634"></a>ner upon the high mountain</em> Chal. Par. upon the city which dwells <a id="l635"></a>securely Isa. 13.2.</p>
<p id="par46">So of cities in general. <em class="underline">I will lay the land most desolate &amp; <a id="l636"></a>the pomp of her strength shall cease, &amp; the mountains of Israel <a id="l637"></a>shall be desolate</em> Ezek. 33.28. <em class="underline">Thou hast said by the multitude <a id="l638"></a>of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains</em> <a id="l639"></a>Chal. Par. to the strong holds of the cities Isa. 37.24.</p>
<p id="par47">And because cities are called mountains with respect to their <a id="l640"></a>dominion, therefore mountains include also the dominions of cities, <a id="l641"></a>as may be seen in Dan 2.35, &amp; Isa. 11.9 where a mountain <a id="l642"></a>fills the earth. And so in the Apocalyps it is to be conceived that the <a id="l643"></a>mountains &amp; Islands are moved out of their places (ch. 6.14) <a id="l644"></a>&amp; flee away (ch. 16.20) in respect of dominion whether civil <a id="l645"></a>or religious.</p>
<p id="par48">For Islands because they are the inhabited &amp; most elevated parts <a id="l646"></a>of the sea, &amp; frequently of a mountanous form (as Tenariff, Saint Hellens, Sicily) signify in the sea what Mountains do on the land.  So at the sound of the second Trumpet when a great <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017r"> &lt;17r&gt; </span> mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea. Apoc. 8.8: it is to be <a id="l649"></a>conceived that the mountain was an high Island. ffor the plague of that <a id="l650"></a>Trumpet fell upon the sea &amp; the fire or war wherewith that mountain <a id="l651"></a>burnt was a part of that plague. ffor an high mountain to rise out <a id="l652"></a>of the sea &amp; or tumble into the sea is of contrary significations <a id="l653"></a>&amp; equally respects a sea-Mountain or high Island in both cases; <a id="l654"></a>the fall of a city of the earth being represented not by a mountain <a id="l655"></a>falling or rolling down into the sea but by its becoming a plain Zech <a id="l656"></a>4.7. This I take to be the signification of Islands of the sea. ffor <a id="l657"></a>such Islands are commonly rocky &amp; mountanous. But when flat &amp; <a id="l658"></a>made by the drying up of waters they signify the cities or provinces of <a id="l659"></a>the waters low in power &amp; made subject to the dominion of the earth. <a id="l660"></a><em class="underline">I will destroy &amp; devour at once, I will make wast mountains &amp; <a id="l661"></a>hills &amp; dry up all their herbs</em> [that is consume their people] <em class="underline">&amp; I <a id="l662"></a>will make the rivers</em> [that are the provinces or kingdoms of the waters] <a id="l663"></a><em class="underline">Islands &amp; will dry up the pools</em>. Isa. 42.15.</p>
<p id="par49"> Mountains being cities, its very proper to represent houses &amp; more especially the <a id="l664"></a>sumptuous stone buildings of Temples &amp; Palaces by dens &amp; rocks <a id="l665"></a>of mountains: their walls being the rocks of Mountains politick, <a id="l666"></a>&amp; their inside the Dens where men represented in prophesy by wild <a id="l667"></a>Beasts resort. <em class="underline">The multitude of the city shall be left, the forts &amp; <a id="l668"></a>towers shall be dens for ever</em> Isa. 32.14. <em class="underline">Let the inhabitants of <a id="l669"></a>the Rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains</em> (i.e. <a id="l670"></a>of the cities) Isa. 42.11. <em class="underline">Behold I am against thee</em> (the house of <a id="l671"></a>David) <em class="underline">O inhabitant of the valley &amp; rock</em>  [i.e. palace or strong hold] <em class="underline">of the plain, <a id="l672"></a>saith the Lord; which say: who shall come down against us or who shall <a id="l673"></a>enter into our habitations?</em> Ier. 21.13.

Isa. 57.5. that is under the Idol Temples, or high places <a id="l682"></a>of Tophet which they built for that purpose in the valley of the son of Himmon. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span> Ier. 7.31, &amp; 19.5, &amp; 32.35. <em class="underline">The high places</em> [or temples] <em class="underline">of</em> [the Idols cal<a id="l683"></a>led] <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> <em class="underline">Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed, the thorn &amp; thistle shall <a id="l684"></a>come upon their Altars &amp; they</em> [the Idols] <em class="underline">shall say to the Mountains, <a id="l685"></a>cover us, &amp; to the hills fall on us,</em> that is to the tops of the mountains &amp; hills which <a id="l686"></a> cover their dens Hos. 10.8. <em class="underline">The Lord alone shall be <a id="l687"></a>exalted in that day &amp; the Idols shall be utterly <sup>✱</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> abolisht, &amp; they shall go <a id="l688"></a>into the holes of the rocks &amp; into the caves of the earth for fear of the Lord,</em> <a id="l689"></a>Isa. 2.19. <em class="underline">In that day shall a Man cast his Idoles – to the Moles &amp; to the <a id="l690"></a>Bats to go into the clifts of the rock, &amp; into <sup>✱</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> tops of the ragged rocks <a id="l691"></a>for fear of the Lord</em>; vers. 21.

<p id="par50">By these instances it may appear that it is according to the use of the Prophets to <a id="l729"></a>represent Idols as men where with the Church commits adultery, &amp; not only so <a id="l730"></a>but to call them by the Names of those Men whose Gods they are, or whose likeness <a id="l731"></a>they bear, as Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Princes, Capitains, Rulers, Hors<a id="l732"></a>men, young men &amp;c. not much unlike their being called in the Apocalyps in the sixt seal, Kings <a id="l733"></a>&amp; great Men, &amp; rich Men &amp; Capitains, &amp; mighty men &amp; bond &amp; free.

<p id="par51">15 Houses by land &amp; ships by sea signify families assemblies &amp; societies <a id="l734"></a>of men.

<p id="par56">16. To put trees and other vegetables for men is a very usuall figure. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span> The Lord hath anointed me – to give them the garment of praise for the <a id="l788"></a>spirit of heaviness that they might be called the trees of righteousness the <a id="l789"></a>planting of the Lord Isa. 61.3. The same Prophet having told a Parable of Gods Vineyards, afterwards thus interprets it <em class="underline">The vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the <a id="l790"></a>house of Israel &amp; the Men of Iudah his pleasant plant</em> Isa. 5.7. They <a id="l791"></a>shall march with an army &amp; come against Egypt with axes as hewers of <a id="l792"></a>wood, they shall cut down her forrest Ier. 46.22.  As thorns cut up shall the people be burnt in the fire Isa 33.12. Wickedness burneth <a id="l793"></a>as the fire, it shall devour the briars &amp; thorns &amp; shall kindle in the <a id="l794"></a>thickets of the forrest, the people shall be as the fewel of the fire which <a id="l795"></a>last words explain the rest Isa. 9.19. Howl fir tree for the cedar is fallen <a id="l796"></a>because all the mighty are spoiled. Howl O ye oaks of Basham, for the <a id="l797"></a>defenced forest Zech. 11.2. How long shall the  land mourn &amp; the herbs <a id="l798"></a>of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. Ier. 12.4. The Lord  will cut off from Israel head &amp; tail, branch &amp; rush in one day Isa 9.14. Neither shall there be any work for Egypt which the head or tail – branch or rush may do. Isa 19.15. They were as the grass of the feild &amp; as corn blasted before it be grown up. Isa 37.27. Psal. 37.2 2 Sam 23.4, 6. <a id="l799"></a>The good seed (whose blade is a plant) are the children of the kingdom <a id="l800"></a>but the tares are the children of the wicked one Matt. 13.38. Every <a id="l801"></a>plant which my ffather hath not planted shall be rooted up. I have <a id="l802"></a>planted Apollos watered &amp;c. So in the Apocalyps trees &amp; herbs are put for men ffor the Locusts there feed not upon realy green things but upon men Apoc. 9.4.</p>
<p id="par57">The Chalde Paraphrast for woods sometimes substitutes armies Isa. <a id="l803"></a>10.18, 34, &amp; sometimes cities or people Ier. 21.14 &amp; 9.18.  And the <a id="l804"></a>Indians, Persians &amp; Egyptians teach: If one dream that he waters &amp; <a id="l805"></a>dresses trees he shall be a very great man &amp; a nourisher of the people. <a id="l806"></a>And if a King dream that he plants trees he shall institute new Ma<a id="l807"></a>gistrates. And if a Plebeian dream that he gathers into his house the <a id="l808"></a>leaves of trees he shall obtain riches from great men proportional <a id="l809"></a>to the leaves. Achmet. c. 151. And if one dream that hail hurt the stalks <a id="l810"></a>of corn there shall be slaughter of men in that place proportional to <a id="l811"></a>the breaking of the stalks c. 191. And that thorns denote pervers &amp; <a id="l812"></a>evil men  c. 213.</p>
<p id="par58">So in Isa. 19.6 &amp; Ier. 51.32. reeds &amp; flaggs of rivers &amp; things <a id="l813"></a>sown by the brooks are put for the men of Kingdoms represented by <a id="l814"></a>waters.</p>

<p id="par59">17. Because Herbs &amp; other vegetables signify men, therefore such <a id="l815"></a>insects as destroy them signify armies of men which in like manner prey <a id="l816"></a>upon countries. <em class="underline">That which the Palmer worm hath left hath the Locust <a id="l817"></a>eaten, &amp; that which the Canker worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten <a id="l818"></a>– ffor a nation is come upon my land strong &amp; without number – <a id="l819"></a>he hath lain my vine wast and barked my figtree, he hath made it clean <a id="l820"></a>bare &amp; cast it away, the branches thereof are made white</em>. Ioel 1.4, 6. See also Ioel <a id="l821"></a>2.2, 25.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span>
<p id="par60">Locusts are generally referred to a multitude of enemies – <em class="underline">If any <a id="l822"></a>King or Potentate see Locusts come upon a place, let him expect a <a id="l823"></a>powerfull multitude of enemies there: &amp; look what hurt the Locusts <a id="l824"></a>do the enemy will mischief proportionally</em> Ind. Pers. Egypt in Achm. <a id="l825"></a>c. 300. So fflies &amp; Bees are by the Chalde Paraphrast interpreted of hostile armies Isa. 7.18.</p>
<p id="par61">Wild Beasts also by reason of their feeding upon vegetables &amp; praying <a id="l826"></a>upon one another signify Kingdoms of the earth with their armies. A parti<a id="l827"></a>cular Beast as in Daniels prophesies, signifies a particular kingdom, and <a id="l828"></a>Beasts in general kingdoms in general. <em class="underline">Come ye, assemble all the Beasts <a id="l829"></a>of the field, come to devour</em> (Chald. Par. <em class="underline">Those that slay with the sword shall <a id="l830"></a>be assembled from all sides: Kings of Nations &amp; their armies shall come to spoil</em>) Ier. 12.9. <em class="underline">The burden of the Beasts of the South,</em> i.e. the <a id="l831"></a>bands of Egypt Isa. 30.6. <em class="underline">Where are the Princes of the Heathen become &amp; such as ruled the Beasts  upon the earth, they that had their pastimes with the fowls of the air</em>? Baruch 3.17 <em class="underline">I have given all these lands into the hands <a id="l832"></a>of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon my servant, &amp; the Beasts of the field <a id="l833"></a>have I given him also to serve him, &amp; all nations shall serve him</em>. <a id="l834"></a>Ier. 27.6 &amp; 28.14. <em class="underline">I will also send wild beasts among you which shall rob <a id="l835"></a>you of your children and destroy your cattel &amp; make you few in number <a id="l836"></a>&amp; your high ways shall be desolate.</em> Levit. 26.22. So Ezekiel representing the captivity of the Iews by a flock of sheep scattered upon all the face of the  earth, saith this flock became a prey &amp; meat to every beast of the feild because there was no sheepherd. Ezek. 34. In Ier. 15.2, 3. &amp; 16.4 Ezek. <a id="l837"></a>5.12, 17 &amp; 14.13, 15, 17, 19, 21; there are described four distinct plagues <a id="l838"></a>to befall the Iews, ffamine, Captivity, Sword &amp; Pestilence whereof <a id="l839"></a>their captivity is represented by Beasts passing through the Land and <a id="l840"></a>spoiling it &amp; making it desolate: so that wild Beasts strictly signify <a id="l841"></a>forreign kingdoms which destroy not by the sword only as in civil wars <a id="l842"></a>but by spoiling a country &amp; carrying away the prey. So Isaiah ch. 5.29  compares such kingdoms to Lions which lay hold on the prey &amp; carry it away safe so that none may deliver it. The pestilence &amp; <a id="l843"></a>famine are in Ier. 15.3 represented by the doggs to tear &amp; the fowls <a id="l844"></a>of heaven to devour: the doggs in the towns to tear the carkasses of those that drop <a id="l845"></a>down dead &amp; want burial, &amp; the fowls in the fields to devoure the corn <a id="l846"></a>, these fowls thence signifying the armies of <a id="l847"></a>enemies which eat up &amp; destroy provisions, &amp; thereby create a famine. So in the Apocalyps <em class="underline">killing with the sword &amp; with hunger &amp; with death &amp; with beasts of the earth</em> is put for killing with civil wars &amp; with famin &amp; with pestilence &amp; with forreign nations Apoc 6.8. And in <a id="l848"></a>Isa. 18.6. ffowls of the Mountains &amp; Beasts of the earth are people of the <a id="l849"></a>cities &amp; nations; &amp; in the same sense Beasts &amp; ffowls are to be understood <a id="l850"></a>in Daniel: <em class="underline">Wheresoever the Children of Men dwell the Beasts of the field <a id="l851"></a>&amp; the ffowls of the heaven</em> [that is the kingdoms of the world represented by <a id="l852"></a>the earth &amp; heaven] <em class="underline">hath he given into Nebuchadnezzars hand &amp; made <a id="l853"></a>him ruler over them all</em>, Dan. 2.38. And in Ezekiel: <em class="underline">All the fowls of heaven made their neasts in his boughs &amp; under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young &amp; under his shadow dwelt all great nations.</em> Ch. 31.6. And in Ier 12 How long shall <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 20v &gt; </span>the land mourn &amp;  the Herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness  of <a id="l854"></a>them that dwell therein? The Beasts are consumed &amp; the Birds because they said <a id="l855"></a>He shall not see our last end. Ier 12.4. My heritage is unto me a speckled bird, the birds <a id="l856"></a>round about her are against her. Ier. 12.9. The eagle which thou sawest come up from the sea is the <a id="l857"></a>kingdom  which was seen in the vision of thy brother Daniel 2 Esdras 12.11. My hand ✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the right margin of f 21r &gt; </span>My hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people, &amp; as one gathereth eggs that  are left <a id="l858"></a>Isa. 10.14. Here a birds moving her wing &amp;  opening her mouth is put for a kingdoms making war. <a id="l859"></a>And in the like sense the fowls of heaven are called to the supper of the great God in the Apocalyps <a id="l860"></a>chap 19.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 20v resumes &gt; </span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 20r resumes &gt; </span>

Hos. 2.<a id="l864"></a>18. So in Isa. 11.6, Beasts are men where tis said that <em class="underline">the wolf shall ly <a id="l865"></a>down with the Lamb &amp; the Leopard shall ly down with the Kid &amp; the Calf &amp; <a id="l866"></a>the young Lyon &amp; the ffatling together &amp; a little child shall lead them <a id="l867"></a>&amp; the cow &amp; the Bear shall feed, their young ones shall lye down toge<a id="l868"></a>ther, &amp; the Lyon shall eat straw like the ox, &amp; the suckling child shall <a id="l869"></a>play on the hole of the Asp, &amp; the weaned child shall put his hand on the <a id="l870"></a>cockatrice; they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my mountain ffor <a id="l871"></a>the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord</em>.

Micah. 4.3. <a id="l877"></a>Of Beasts of the earth &amp; fowls of the heaven being put for the people <a id="l878"></a>of nations &amp; Kingdoms you may farther see Dan. 4.12, 14. Ezek. 17 <a id="l879"></a>23 &amp; 29.5 &amp; 31.6, 13 &amp; 32.4. . So in the Apocalyps the ffowls <a id="l880"></a>of the heaven which are called to a great supper of the great God are <a id="l881"></a>men represented a little before by the armies <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>in heaven<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> as you <a id="l882"></a>may understand by comparing the place with Ezek. 39.17.</p>
<p id="par62">Fishes are also generally put for men. I will make you ffishers of <a id="l883"></a>Men M. 4.19. I will send for many ffishers &amp; they shall fish them, &amp; <a id="l884"></a>after will I send for many hunters &amp; they shall hunt them Ier. 16.<a id="l885"></a>16. I will take away your posterity with fishhooks Amos. 4.2. Thou <a id="l886"></a>makest men as fishes of the sea – they take up all of them with the <a id="l887"></a>angle &amp; catch them in their net. – Shal they therefore empty their <a id="l888"></a>net &amp; spare continually to slay the nations? Habak. 1.14, 15, 17. In Ezek. <a id="l889"></a>29.4, 5, The King of Egypt is represented by a water dragon or <a id="l890"></a>Crocodile &amp; his people by the fishes of the river Nile. In Hosea. 4.3 <a id="l891"></a>Zeph. 1.3. &amp; Ezek. 38.20, where the Beasts of the earth, the ffowls of <a id="l892"></a>the heaven &amp; the ffishes of the sea are either sacrificed or destroyed <a id="l893"></a>by wars, its nonsense to understand any thing by these creatures <a id="l894"></a>but Men.

Solomon interprets the Tree of life to be wisdom (Prov. 3.18) &amp; wholsome doctrine (ch 15.4) &amp; the fruit or works of the righteous (ch. 11.30) And  Christ speaks of eating the fruit <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>of<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019v"> &lt;19v&gt; </span> this tree where he saith <em class="underline">My meat is to do the will of him that sent me &amp; to finish <a id="l896"></a>his work</em>. Iohn 4.34.  This fruit is the bread of life &amp; the hidden Name of the <a id="l897"></a>flesh of Christ to be eaten by each, concerning which Christ saith:  <em class="underline">I am the <a id="l898"></a>bread of life; he that cometh to me shall never hunger &amp; he that beleiveth <a id="l899"></a>on me shall never thirst</em>.

If any man eat of this bread he shall live for <a id="l904"></a>ever: &amp; the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the <a id="l905"></a>life of the world. – whoso eateth my flesh &amp; drinketh my blood hath <a id="l906"></a>eternal life &amp; I will raise him up at the last day</em>. vers Iohn 6.35, 47, 54. <a id="l907"></a>The fruit of the tree of life &amp; the river of the water of life (Apoc. 22 &amp; Ezek <a id="l908"></a>47) is this mystical flesh &amp; blood of Christ to be eaten &amp; drunk by faith. ffor this <a id="l909"></a>flesh &amp; blood is mystical  (Iohn 6.63) &amp;  that is the doctrine  as the flesh of the Whore of Babylon  &amp; such like temporal bodies <a id="l911"></a>signifies their temporal wealth so the flesh of Christ signifies the spirituall <a id="l912"></a>riches of his incarnation &amp; passion,  the acquiring of which by faith is typified by eating <a id="l913"></a>the Eucharist.</p>
<p id="par64">And as the tree of life is mystical so is y<sup>e</sup> tree of knowledg of good &amp; evil. <a id="l914"></a>ffor these are relatives by way of opposition  being the trees of life &amp; death: ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from higher up f 19v &gt; </span> ✝For the tree of knowledge is the tree of death. In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt dye.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from lower down f 19v resumes &gt; </span> &amp; therefore since the one is the law of God the other must be the  inclinations of the flesh. To eat the fruit of this tree signifies the acquiring of some  unhappy <a id="l915"></a>knowledg or other, but what that knowledge was is difficult to say. Tis called <a id="l916"></a>the knowledg of good &amp; evil, that is of happiness &amp; misery, because it brought <a id="l917"></a>  the knowledge of both. For happiness is never so well understood as when tis lost. Tis the opinion <a id="l918"></a>of the Iewish Doctors that Adam eat of this fruit by knowing his wife <a id="l919"></a>ffor this  is the phrase which Moses uses for carnal copulation. <em class="underline">Adam knew his <a id="l920"></a>wife</em> (Gen. 4.1 <em class="underline">Cain knew his wife</em> vers 17) <em class="underline">Adam knew his wife again</em> (vers 25.)  Also the consequence of eating this fruit was that Adam &amp; Eve were <a id="l921"></a>both ashamed of their nakedness &amp; began to cover their shame with aprons; that <a id="l922"></a>Eves conception should be multiplied &amp; she should bring forth children in <a id="l923"></a>sorrow &amp; that her desire should thenceforth be to her husband; &amp; that Adam should till the ground in<a id="l924"></a>  the sweat of his brows &amp; eat of it in sorrow.  all which were the natural consequences of their knowing one another. For Adam began then to till the ground in the sweat of his brow &amp; eat of it in sorrow when his seed became too many to be nourished by the spon<a id="l926"></a>taneous fruits of the earth.  And <a id="l927"></a>further, tis added immediately after this sentence that <em class="underline">Adam called his wife Eve <a id="l928"></a>because she was the mother of all flesh</em> Gen. 3.20: whence it follows that <a id="l929"></a>he knew her in Paradise before this sentence. ‡ Twas  an opinion also of &amp;c<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 20r &gt; </span> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 19v resumes &gt; </span>  The tree of life &amp; the tree of know<a id="l935"></a>ledge  are of a contrary nature,  so that by knowing one you may know the other.  For the one lead<a id="l936"></a> to life, the other to death on the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall dye. And therefore since the fruits of the one are  such <a id="l937"></a>thoughts &amp; actions as lead to life, the fruits of the other may be not only <a id="l938"></a>such actions but also such thoughts as lead to death. But what truth there is in the  opinions of the Iewish Doctors I leave to be considered Concerning the tree of <a id="l939"></a>life tis said that the fruit shall be for meat &amp; the leaves for  healing of the nations <a id="l940"></a>Ezek 47.12. Apoc 22. By which it should seem that the fruit taken inwardly <a id="l941"></a>signifies inward grace &amp; faith by which men  are saved &amp; that the leaves <a id="l942"></a>applied outwardly are external good works by  means of which the nati<a id="l943"></a>ons live  peaceably &amp; happily together. And if this be so, then eating <a id="l944"></a>the forbidden fruit will rather signify the admission of lust into the mind <a id="l945"></a>then the commission of the external act.</p>
<p id="par65">A Dragon or serpent, if called the old serpent or the Devil signifies the spirit <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020v"> &lt;20v&gt; </span> of error delusion &amp; inordinate affections reigning in the world. ffor spirits good <a id="l946"></a>or evil are sometimes put for the tempers dispositions &amp; persuasions of mens minds much after the manner that we often take death for a substance. <em class="underline">Hereby</em>, saith Iohn, <em class="underline">we know that he abideth in us by the spirit <a id="l947"></a>that he hath given us.

The spirits of God of fals Pro<a id="l954"></a>phets &amp; of Antichrist are here plainly taken not for any substantial <a id="l955"></a>spirits but for the good or evil dispositions &amp; true or fals perswasions of <a id="l956"></a>mens minds; &amp; the spirits of all men who confess not that Iesus Christ <a id="l957"></a>is come in the flesh is called in the singular number the spirit of <a id="l958"></a>Antichrist, &amp; said to be come into the world as if it were an evil <a id="l959"></a>spirit which was to reign therein &amp; deceive all the followers of Anti<a id="l960"></a>Christ. And such an evil spirit is the Dragon in the Apocalyps. ffor <a id="l961"></a>he is there called the old serpent the Devil &amp; Satan &amp; therefore came into <a id="l962"></a>the world  at the deception of Eve &amp; hath ever since reigned in it &amp; <a id="l963"></a>must reign till he shall be shut up in the bottomless pit. This is that <a id="l964"></a>Prince of the Air  whom Paul calls the <em class="underline">spirit of the world</em> 1 Cor. 2.<a id="l965"></a>12 &amp; of whom he saith: <em class="underline">In times past ye walked in sins according <a id="l966"></a>to the course  of the world according to the Prince of the <a id="l967"></a> power of the air the sirit that now worketh in the children <a id="l968"></a>of disobedience</em> Eph. 2.2 <em class="underline">This is that adversary the Devil which as a <a id="l969"></a>roaring Lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour</em>. 1 Pet. 5.8. <a id="l970"></a>By this Devils being cast into the bottomless pit &amp; shut up that he should deceive <a id="l971"></a>the nations no more for a thousand years you may know that he is <a id="l972"></a>the spirit of delusion reigning in the hearts of men &amp; by his being <a id="l973"></a>there called the old serpent you may know that he is that same <a id="l974"></a>serpent which deceived Eve. For that old serpent was to continue till the <a id="l975"></a>seed of the woman should bruise his head, that is till Christ should van<a id="l976"></a>quish &amp; slay him, which is  not yet  done. He still reigns &amp; must reign till the end of the world.  But then the Word of <a id="l978"></a>God (with his army vanquishing the wicked nations &amp; causing the  Old serpent to be thrown first <a id="l979"></a>into the bottomles pit &amp; then into the lake of fire,  bruises his head  effectually, <a id="l982"></a> &amp; thereby restores to mankind that Paradise with the <a id="l983"></a>tree of life which their father Adam  at the entrance of this serpent  into the world had lost. So then the old Serpent was no more a real serpent then the Dragon in the Apocalyps is a real Dragon or then <a id="l985"></a> the Beasts in Iohn &amp; Daniel are real Beasts. Tis only a symbol of <a id="l986"></a>the spirit of delusion &amp; therefore the  curs of this serpent for <a id="l987"></a>deceiving Eve must be interpreted accordingly.  Whence I conceive it will amount to no <a id="l988"></a>more then this, That because this  Spirit had deceived Eve he should be represent<a id="l989"></a>ed by, &amp; symbolically become the most acursed of all beasts, even the serpent which <a id="l990"></a>eats dust &amp; goes upon its belly. He that considers well the Parable of Gods setting <a id="l991"></a>the rainbow in the heavens will find no difficulty in this of the serpent: the nature #<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 21v &gt; </span> # of the serpent being no more changed  in this parable <a id="l992"></a>then that of the Bow in  that . For tis agreed that Eve was deceived by <a id="l993"></a>the Devil &amp; that the Serpent was only a symbol of the Deceiver, &amp; there<a id="l994"></a>fore to make the serpent really metamorphised &amp; condemned to creep on his <a id="l995"></a>belly  because the Devil had offended is to punish one thing for anothers <a id="l996"></a>fault, &amp; to make the signe suffer in a litteral sense for the crime of the <a id="l997"></a>thing signified: which is absurd &amp; unagreable to the nature &amp; designe of Para<a id="l998"></a>bles. When the ancient Sages  would have one thing to be represented by ano<a id="l999"></a>ther, they framed a Metamorphosis of the one into the other, &amp; thence came <a id="l1000"></a>all the ancient Metamorphoses recited by Ovid &amp; others. This was their way <a id="l1001"></a>of making Parables, &amp; Moses in this Parable of the Serpent speaks in <a id="l1002"></a>the language of the ancient  wise men, being skilled in all the <a id="l1003"></a>learning of the Egyptians.</p>
<p id="par66">From this figure of putting serpents for spirits &amp; spirits or Dæmons <a id="l1004"></a>for distempers of the mind, came the vulgar opinion of the Iews &amp; other <a id="l1005"></a>eastern nations that mad men &amp; lunaticks were possessed with evil spirits <a id="l1006"></a>or Dæmons. Whence Christ seems to have used this language not only <a id="l1007"></a>as a Prophet but also in compliance with the Iews way of speaking: so that <a id="l1008"></a>when he is said to cast out Devils  those <a id="l1009"></a>Devils may be  diseases unles where it can be proved by the <a id="l1010"></a>circumstances that they are  substantial spirits. For the  language of  casting out a spirit is used for the cure of a Lunatique <a id="l1012"></a>Matt 17.15, 18, 19.</p>
<p id="par67">Now whilst the earth with its trees &amp; vegetables are put for nations the <a id="l1013"></a>Prophet uses  a Garden or other watered &amp; fertile region for a happy &amp; flourishing <a id="l1014"></a>people &amp; a dry barren &amp; desolate wilderness for the country of an oppressed wasted &amp; <a id="l1015"></a>captivated people &amp; beasts in this wilderness for hostile kingdoms which invade &amp; wast  <a id="l1016"></a>this  country. So the King of Tyre whilst in a flourishing condition is said to be in <a id="l1017"></a>Eden the garden of God Ezek. 28.13 &amp; Ephraim like Tyrus to be planted in a pleasant <a id="l1018"></a>place, but afterwards when he is smitten by the enemy, to have his root dried up. <a id="l1019"></a>Hos. 9.13, 16. So in Ezek 31.9 where God saith, <em class="underline">I have made the king of <a id="l1020"></a>Babylon fair by the multitude of his branches so that all the trees of Eden <a id="l1021"></a> that were in the Garden of God envied him</em>: the trees in this Garden <a id="l1022"></a>(as the Chalde Paraphrast interprets) are the Kings of the eastern nations whereof the Babylonian is the chief &amp; <a id="l1023"></a>their flourishing kingdoms are the Garden. But when Babylon is to be laid <a id="l1024"></a>wast the Prophet saith, <em class="underline">Chaldea shall be a spoil, the hindermost of the <a id="l1025"></a>nations a wilderness a dry land &amp; a desart.</em> Ier 50.10, 12. So Ioel describing <a id="l1026"></a>the invasion of Zion by a mighty  foreign army saith, <em class="underline">The land is as <a id="l1027"></a>the Garden of Eden before them &amp; behind them a desolate wilderness</em>. Ioel <a id="l1028"></a>2.3 And so God threatens to make Nineveh a desolation &amp; dry like a wilderness <a id="l1029"></a>a place for beasts of the nations to lye down in. Zeph. 2.13, 15. After this manner <a id="l1030"></a>do the prophets consider Iudæa  before their captivity as a fertile region &amp; during <a id="l1031"></a>their captivity as a wilderness. <em class="underline">The fruitfull place was a wilderness &amp; all <a id="l1032"></a>the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord &amp; by his <a id="l1033"></a>fierce anger: for thus hath the Lord said, The whole land shall be desolate</em> <a id="l1034"></a>Ier. 4.26. <em class="underline">Many Pastors have destroyed my Vineyard, they have troden my portion <a id="l1035"></a>under foot they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness</em> Ier. 12.10. <a id="l1036"></a><em class="underline">Thy holy cities are a wildernesse, Zion is a wilderness, Ierusalem a desolation</em>. <a id="l1037"></a>Isa. 64.10. But when they return from captivity their wilderness becomes a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022v"> &lt;22v&gt; </span> paradise &amp; their vanquished enemies a wilderness. The Lord shall com<a id="l1038"></a><em class="underline">fort Zion, he will comfort all her wast places, he will make her <a id="l1039"></a>Wilderness like Eden &amp; her desart like the garden of the Lord</em> Isa. 51.3 <a id="l1040"></a><em class="underline">This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden &amp; the wasted <a id="l1041"></a>&amp; desolate &amp; ruined cities are become inhabited</em> Ezek. 36.35. <em class="underline">In that day <a id="l1042"></a>the mountains shall drop down new wine &amp; the hills shall flow with milk <a id="l1043"></a>&amp; all the rivers of Iudah shall flow with waters &amp; a fountain shall come <a id="l1044"></a>forth of the house of the Lord &amp; shall water the valley of Mittim. <a id="l1045"></a>Egypt shall be a desolation &amp; Edom shall be a desolate wilderness for the <a id="l1046"></a>violence against the Children of Iudah, because they have shed innocent <a id="l1047"></a>blood in their land: but Iudah shall dwell for ever</em> Ioel. 3.18, 19 And the <a id="l1048"></a>same language is used in the Apocalyps: for there the Holy City troden under <a id="l1049"></a>foot by the Gentiles in whose region it rains not in the days of the prophesy <a id="l1050"></a>of the two Witnesses Apoc. 11, is by reason of this desolation &amp;   barrenness called a Wildernesse Apoc. 17 &amp; the nations <a id="l1052"></a>which make desolate that city are represented by a Beast in the Wilderness. <a id="l1053"></a>But after the end of those times when the Beast is destroyed &amp; the Saints <a id="l1054"></a>begin to reign, their new state is represented by a Paradise with a river of <a id="l1055"></a>the water of life to water it &amp; the tree of life growing upon the banks <a id="l1056"></a>of the river Apoc. 22.1, 2 &amp; 2.7. The golden age of the first world <a id="l1057"></a>was a Paradise which man lost by the fraud of the old serpent &amp; out of <a id="l1058"></a>which he  is still kept by the flaming sword: but when the <a id="l1059"></a>head of that serpent shall be bruised, then shall man recover Paradise <a id="l1060"></a>&amp; the nations shall beat their swords into plowshares &amp; learn war no <a id="l1061"></a>more. So then the wilderness in the Apocalyps is according to the language <a id="l1062"></a>of the Prophets the holy City or Church of God troden under foot by the waters. And this <a id="l1063"></a>unfolds the language of Daniel where he speaks of taking away the daily <a id="l1064"></a>sacrifice &amp; placing the Abomination which maketh desolate, that is  the idolatry then maketh <a id="l1065"></a>the Church  a desolate wilderness during the captivity. <br><br></p></div>

<p id="par70">So Nebuchadnezzar is represented by a very large tree Dan. 4 <a id="l1083"></a>And the King of Assyria by a Cedar Ezek. 31. In which Chapter also the Kings <a id="l1084"></a>&amp; Princes of  Israel &amp; Iudah are represented by cedars, ffirtrees, <a id="l1085"></a>&amp; Chesnut trees, &amp; the holy land by the garden of God. So in Isa 37.<a id="l1086"></a>24. Thou (Sennacherib King of Assyria) hast said, by the multitude of <a id="l1087"></a>my chariots am I come up – to the sides of Lebanon, &amp; I will cut <a id="l1088"></a>down the tall Cedars thereof, &amp; the choise ffirtrees thereof. See also <a id="l1089"></a>Zech. 11.2. Isa. 2.13 &amp; 10.19, 33, 34. Ier. 22.7. Ezek 20.47 &amp;c.

And so Achmet. in c. 151, 165 &amp; 200 is very particular in sorting <a id="l1095"></a>several kinds of trees to several sorts of men.</p>
<p id="par71">In like manner Ezekiel representing the kingdom of Egypt by <a id="l1096"></a>the river Nile with all its ffishes, puts the Crocodile or water Dragon <a id="l1097"></a>for Pharaoh, &amp; Achmet tells us that, <em class="underline">A Dragon signifies the person <a id="l1098"></a>of an hostile King, &amp; serpents according to their bigness the persons <a id="l1099"></a>of other greater or lesser enemies. If a Dragon appear to a <a id="l1100"></a>King in a dream, he shall be troubled with the rumor of another King. <a id="l1101"></a>If any one happen upon a very great golden Dragon adorned on his <a id="l1102"></a>back with scales as it were with Iewels &amp; make him his own: he <a id="l1103"></a>shall obtain a kingdom &amp; dominion over the people. Achm. c. 288</em> Ex <a id="l1104"></a>Ind. Pers. Ægypt. So Daniel &amp; Iohn put several great Beasts for several <a id="l1105"></a>Kings &amp; not only for Kings but also for their Kingdoms, the kingdome <a id="l1106"></a>being the mystical body of the King. In prophesy its very usual to put <a id="l1107"></a>a singular for a plurall &amp; one thing of any kind for the whole Species: <a id="l1108"></a>as a great Dragon for the species of Dragons &amp; Serpents; a plant for <a id="l1109"></a>the species of plants; a ffrogg for the whole species of ffroggs; &amp; in that <a id="l1110"></a>respect also a single beast or tree is  put for a body politique. <a id="l1111"></a>And it is usually done when the tree or beast has some quality analogous to the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023r"> &lt;23r&gt; </span> quality of the men. So Iacob calls Iudah a Lyon from his <a id="l1112"></a>getting the prey &amp; being Prince of the tribes, Issachar an Ass from <a id="l1113"></a>his being in slavery, Dan a Serpent from his laying stratagems &amp; <a id="l1114"></a>Benjamin a Wolf from his ravening &amp; devouring: a singular <a id="l1115"></a>being put for a plural. So Micah represents warlike Zion by a beast with a horn of iron &amp; hoofs of brass. <em class="underline">Arise &amp; thresh o daughter of Zion &amp; I will make thine horn Iron &amp; thine hoofs brass &amp; thou shalt beat in pieces many nations</em>. Mic. 4.13. When vegetables or animals are <a id="l1116"></a>spoken of in general they signify men in general: but when any <a id="l1117"></a>single tree or beast is described it signifies either a king with his <a id="l1118"></a>mystical body of the kingdome or some other body politique: the sacred <a id="l1119"></a>prophesies where they are mystical respecting only great things <a id="l1120"></a>&amp; seldome or never descending to the consideration of single persons <a id="l1121"></a>alone without respect to their mystical bodies.</p>
<p id="par72">19 When therefore bodies politique are to be represented according <a id="l1122"></a>to their qualities, such animals are chosen as are most fit to <a id="l1123"></a>do it. So in Daniel the first of the four Empires was fitly <a id="l1124"></a>represented by a Lyon becaues of his being head of the Empires <a id="l1125"></a>&amp; king of the Beasts of the earth politique (Dan 2.38 Ier. 27.7)  the second by a Beare  because of <a id="l1127"></a>his voraciousness of riches signified by flesh (Dan 7.5) &amp; because of the fierceness &amp; plenty of Bears in Persia, the third by a <a id="l1128"></a>Leopard because of his quick &amp; fierce motions, (Dan 8.5, 6, 7) &amp; <a id="l1129"></a>the fourth by a strange monster because of his strangely mixt <a id="l1130"></a>power &amp; government (democratical &amp; monarchical civil &amp; <a id="l1131"></a>ecclesiastical) wherein he was divers from all the other king<a id="l1132"></a>doms.  So again in the prophesy of the Ram &amp; Goat the Persians <a id="l1133"></a>are denoted by the Ram because of their great riches whereof <a id="l1134"></a>Rams (according to the doctrine of the Eastern nations as Achmet <a id="l1135"></a>informs us) were a type, &amp; the Greeks are represented by the Goat  partly, because ✝<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> Caramus founded the Kingdom of Macedon by following a flock of Goats &amp; thence gave the name of Ægea to the regal city &amp; of Ægeadæ to the people &amp; partly because the Greeks were to take away the daily sacrifice &amp; place the abomination &amp;  by consequence to be <a id="l1137"></a>the most remarkable of Daniels Kingdoms for Idolatry. ffor a Goat is a very salacious <a id="l1138"></a>animal &amp; like Priapus was worshipped, saith <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> Diodorus, for his genital part in honour of generation);  &amp; lechery is the type of Idolatry.  Mendesij in Egypt <a id="l1139"></a> worshipped Goats &amp; Pan &amp; the <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> Egyptian Priests succeeding in their fathers Priesthood were first initiated to this God &amp; hence  the Theology of the Heathens was  <a id="l1140"></a>much of Pan, Sylvanus, Faunus, Sileni &amp; Satyrs which are Goats deified, &amp; <a id="l1141"></a> in scripture Goats &amp; satyrs are put for  fals Gods &amp; unclean <a id="l1142"></a>spirits or Devils such as the Heathen worshipped as you may see <a id="l1143"></a>in  Levit 17.7 (Deut 32.17 &amp; 2 Chron. 11.15 , &amp; by comparing Isa 13.21, 22  34.14 <a id="l1144"></a>with Apoc. 18.2.  Whence Goats are put for wicked men Matt 25.32 <a id="l1145"></a> for Idolaters <a id="l1146"></a>Zech 10.3 &amp; for heathen kings &amp; kingdoms Isa 14.9 &amp; Ezek 34.17. <a id="l1147"></a>&amp; 39.18.</p>
<p id="par73">And as a  lecherous Goat is the type of an idolatrous kingdome <a id="l1148"></a>so a whorish woman is the  type of an idolatrous Church. Nor is there any type more frequent then this. The <a id="l1149"></a>Church is the wife of God (Ier 3.1, 8 Hosea 2.1, 7) &amp; for her to worship <a id="l1150"></a>other Gods is to forsake her husband &amp; go a whoring after <a id="l1151"></a>other Lovers Isa 3. Ezek 16 &amp; 25. Whence it is that no sort of <a id="l1152"></a>people whatever besides an apostate church of God are mystically represented <a id="l1153"></a>in prophesy by a whore. ffor none else are even considered as God's wife.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p024r"> &lt;24r&gt; </span>
<p id="par74">Now as impure Goats signify both Idolaters &amp; their Gods so <a id="l1154"></a>also do serpents. For <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> because of the sprightfulness  fiery <a id="l1155"></a>nature quick &amp; vigorous motions &amp; long life of this animal, the ancient Egyptians (being <a id="l1156"></a>so taught by Theuth or Mercury the founder of their Theology) <a id="l1157"></a>reputed the nature of serpents divine; &amp; representing an immortal <a id="l1158"></a>divinity thereby,  <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> they called them  Αγαθοδαίμονας <a id="l1159"></a>Happy Dæmons or Dæmon-Gods &amp; Cneph the universal spirit &amp; <a id="l1160"></a><sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> worshipped them &amp; <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup>  on the heads of their Gods they painted the king of serpents the Basilisk, as a <a id="l1162"></a>symbol of divinity. So also <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> on the  heads or Diadems of their Kings they <a id="l1163"></a>formed a Serpent as a symbol of sacred majesty: &amp; the <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> Kings <a id="l1164"></a>themselves they represented also by serpents, signifying a vi<a id="l1165"></a>gilant King by a watchfull serpent, &amp; a king of the whole <a id="l1166"></a>world by a serpent  turned round, the head biting the tail, <a id="l1167"></a>with a great house somtimes painted in the middle for a symbol <a id="l1168"></a>of the habitable world:  as Horus relates, who adds that <em class="underline">to <a id="l1169"></a>represent a king ruling over a part of the world they paint <a id="l1170"></a>a part of a serpent signifying a King by the animal &amp; his <a id="l1171"></a>rule over a part by a part of the body; but a Governour <a id="l1172"></a>of the Vniverse they represent by the perfection of the ani<a id="l1173"></a>mal, painting a whole serpent: And so also with them, saith <a id="l1174"></a>he, it signifies the spirit which pervades the whole world.</em> <a id="l1175"></a>This is the spirit Cneph, &amp; the original of thie Hieroglyphick <a id="l1176"></a>seems to be their painting <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> the orbs of the Planets by serpents <a id="l1177"></a>thus turned round. ffor the Planets were the most ancient of <a id="l1178"></a>all the heathen Gods, idolatry beginning with the adoration of <a id="l1179"></a>the starrs. The <sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup> same spirit they painted also by a serpent extended at length through the midst of a circle. The Egyptians feigned also Typhon (whom they took <a id="l1180"></a>for an evil spirit, the principle of all evil &amp; mischief) to have <a id="l1181"></a>been <sup>k</sup><sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup> transformed into a Crocodile or water Dragon: whence per<a id="l1182"></a>haps sprang the fable of the serpent Python; for Python &amp; Typhon <a id="l1183"></a>are the same. 
And  hence perhaps the eastern interpreters of dreams  referred  serpents to enemies (as Achmet informs us) <a id="l1185"></a>&amp; interpreted Dragons of hostile kings &amp; other serpents of other ene<a id="l1186"></a>mies great or little according to the magnitude of the ser<a id="l1187"></a>pents. From all which you may understand why the King <a id="l1188"></a>of Egypt is so often in scripture represented by a Dragon &amp; <a id="l1189"></a>also what is meant by the Dragon in the Apocalyps. For <a id="l1190"></a>this Dragon by his being crowned &amp;  giving his throne &amp; power <a id="l1191"></a> to the Beast is manifestly a kingdom, &amp; by <a id="l1192"></a>his persecuting the woman &amp; her seed is an enemy to God's <a id="l1193"></a>people &amp; by his being called that old Serpent  the Devil &amp; <a id="l1194"></a>Satan who deceiveth the whole world he together with his mysti<a id="l1195"></a>cal body of evil Angels signifies the heathen Dæmon-Gods <a id="l1196"></a> severally called Devils &amp; collectively <a id="l1197"></a>the Devil. Whence it follows that the Kingdom signified by this Dra<a id="l1198"></a>gon must be Idolatrous. In the armies of the Roman Empire <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025r"> &lt;25r&gt; </span> both before &amp; after the Empire became Christian,  <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup> a flying <a id="l1199"></a>Eagle was in the standart of every Legion &amp; a Dragon on <a id="l1200"></a>the standart of every Company &amp; in every Legion there were <a id="l1201"></a>ten Companies &amp; by consequence ten Dragons. These Dragons as <a id="l1202"></a>b<sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup> Ammianus describes them were of a purple colour &amp; so fastened <a id="l1203"></a>to the top of a long pike, as, like weathercocks, to turn their <a id="l1204"></a>tails from the wind &amp; to hiss by means of the wind blowing <a id="l1205"></a>into their jaws opened wide. The bearers of these two sorts of <a id="l1206"></a>standarts were thence called Aquiliferi &amp; <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup> Draconarij. And to these  badges of the Roman Empire, I conceive the Eagle in  the second book of Esdras chap 11 &amp; 12 &amp; both <a id="l1209"></a>the  great Eagle &amp; the great red Dragon in the Apocalyps <a id="l1210"></a>chap 12 do plainly allude. For this Dragon is by all interpre<a id="l1211"></a>ters applied to the Roman Empire.</p>
<p id="par77">There is yet another symbol of Idolaters. For Froggs <a id="l1212"></a>signify both spirits of Devils &amp; societies of men actuated by <a id="l1213"></a>such spirits in preaching &amp; working miracles for seducing their wor<a id="l1214"></a>shippers of the Beast &amp; his image. Apoc. 15.5. Artemidorus an interpre<a id="l1215"></a>ter of dreams  (lib. 2, cap 3) saith that ffroggs signify impostors <a id="l1216"></a>&amp; scoffers, &amp; Arius Montanus (De arcano serm.) that  in being un<a id="l1217"></a>clean animals &amp; loquacious they signify ffals Prophets. So Grotius (in <a id="l1218"></a>Apoc 16.13) <em class="underline">Ranaæ et impuræ sunt et in cæno versuntur &amp; coaxant <a id="l1219"></a>nullo cum fructu.

So Aristotle in his Physiognomonicks saith that they <a id="l1225"></a>whose sides are turgid &amp; as it were blown up, are loquacious &amp; <a id="l1226"></a>foolish bablers &amp; are referred to ffroggs. And Tzetzi (in Chilia<a id="l1227"></a>dis 8<sup>væ</sup> Historia 201) that Aristophanes in Βατράχοις by ffroggs <a id="l1228"></a>understands clamorous &amp; unseasonable talkers who glory not with <a id="l1229"></a>reason &amp; judgment, but with senseless &amp; foolish voices after the <a id="l1230"></a>manner of ffroggs. And that this interpretation was anciently received <a id="l1231"></a>among the Oriental nations is manifest by the Fable (related by <a id="l1232"></a>Ovid &amp; others) that when  Latona came to the fountain Mele <a id="l1233"></a>to drink, the Lycij for hindring her &amp;  with  <a id="l1234"></a>much ill language railing at her were turned to ffroggs, &amp; so, <a id="l1235"></a>saith Ovid, they continued litigious &amp; impudent.</p>
<div class="lg"><p class="l"><em class="underline">Litibus exercent linguas, pulsoque pudore</em> &amp;c.</p></div>
<p id="par78" class="i0">And to the same purpose it is that Horus (lib. 2 Hierogl. c. 96) tells us <a id="l1236"></a>that amongst the Egyptians a Frogg was the symbol of an impudent <a id="l1237"></a>man. So then Froggs in the Apocalyps signify loquacious &amp; clamorous <a id="l1238"></a>seducers.</p>
<p id="par79">When  natural animals  do not sufficiently answer to king<a id="l1239"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span>doms the Spirit of Prophesy frames others which do  Such is the <a id="l1240"></a>Leopard with four heads &amp; four wings in Daniel &amp; the Beast with <a id="l1241"></a>seven heads &amp; ten horns in Iohn &amp; the Cherubims &amp; Seraphims <a id="l1242"></a>in the other Prophets. These last are usually taken for orders of Angels <a id="l1243"></a>but really are only Hieroglyphicks formed like animals &amp; signifying <a id="l1244"></a>people. Ezekiel calls the Cherubims which he saw, living creatures; <a id="l1245"></a>&amp; the four  Seraphims of Isaiah are called four Beasts <a id="l1246"></a>or living creatures by Iohn. That these animals are hieroglyphics <a id="l1247"></a>you may know both by the relation which they have one to another <a id="l1248"></a>a Cherubim being composed of four Seraphims joyned in one body, &amp; <a id="l1249"></a>by the constant respect they have to the four quarters of the heavens <a id="l1250"></a>without changing their posture, &amp; also by their many wings &amp; eyes &amp;  faces. ffor a Cherubin with four faces &amp; a Beast with many heads are figures of the same kind. The four Seraphims are figures taken from <a id="l1251"></a>the Standarts or banners of the four squadrons of Israel encamped <a id="l1252"></a>in the Wilderness  &amp; so are also the four faces of a Cherubim &amp; thence both Cherubims &amp; Seraphims are used as the Hieroglyphicks of <a id="l1253"></a>armies. Whence Ezekiel saith that the noise of the wings of the <a id="l1254"></a>Cherubims is as the noise of great waters (that is of much people) <a id="l1255"></a>&amp; the voice of their speech as the noise of an host. The name <a id="l1256"></a>Seraphim signifies things which are fiery &amp; burn other things,  &amp; the name Cherubim (if originally <a id="l1258"></a>taken from כו רב) signifies much burning;  &amp; accordingly Ezekiel<sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> describes <a id="l1259"></a>his Cherubims like burning coals of fire &amp; like the appearance of <a id="l1260"></a>lamps &amp; of a flash of lightning. Now  fire, in the language <a id="l1261"></a>of the prophets, is war &amp; to burn is to consume by war; &amp; there<a id="l1262"></a>fore  Cherubims &amp; Seraphims  being fiery animals signify  warlike bodies of men, <a id="l1264"></a>that is armies. Hence Moses to signify that man is kept out of <a id="l1265"></a>Paradise by war, places before the Garden Cherubims &amp; the <a id="l1266"></a>edge of a flaming sword turning every way to keep the way of the <a id="l1267"></a>tree of life. Paradise is guarded by fiery Beasts &amp; a flaming sword <a id="l1268"></a>that is (in the language of the Prophets) by armies &amp; the sword <a id="l1269"></a>of war. Hence also God is seated upon the wings of the Cheru<a id="l1270"></a>bims to signify that he is the Lord of Hosts the King of Israel <a id="l1271"></a>ffor sitting or riding upon Beasts is the type of reigning over <a id="l1272"></a>people.</p>

<p id="par81">20 Now when the Body natural of any animal is put for any body <a id="l1287"></a>politique the several members of the one are fitly put for the several analogous parts <a id="l1288"></a>of the other &amp; particularly the head &amp; tail as two extremes are put, <a id="l1289"></a>the one for the Court consisting of the governours &amp; honourable Men &amp; ffamily of the King &amp; <a id="l1290"></a>the other for the  vulgar and base people. So Princes Rulers &amp; <a id="l1291"></a>Leaders are frequently called the heads of the people Num. 17.8, &amp; <a id="l1292"></a>25.15. Ios. 22.14. Iud. 10.18 &amp; 11.8, 9, 11. Isa. 7.8, &amp;c. And so are kings <a id="l1293"></a>1 Sam. 15.17. Psal. 18.43. Isa. 7.8 &amp; conquerors, <em class="underline">Thou hast kept <a id="l1294"></a>me</em>, saith David, <em class="underline">to be head of the heathen; a people whom I knew <a id="l1295"></a>not shall serve me, strangers shall submit themselves unto me, <a id="l1296"></a>as soon as they hear they shall be obedient unto me</em> Psal. 18.43. <a id="l1297"></a>So also are the houses or ffamilies of Kings: <em class="underline">Thus saith the Lord <a id="l1298"></a>unto the Kings house of Iudah. Thou art Gilead unto me &amp; the <a id="l1299"></a>head of</em> [the forrest politique] <em class="underline">of Lebanon, yet surely I will make <a id="l1300"></a>thee a wilderness &amp; cities which are not inhabited – &amp; they shall <a id="l1301"></a>cut down thy choice cedars</em> &amp;c. Ier. 22.6. And so in general are <a id="l1302"></a>ffamilies, people, Courts &amp; Nations which rule over others. So where Isaiah saith of Iudah: <em class="underline">ffrom the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it</em>: the Chalde Paraphrast interprets: ffrom the lower people to the Princes. Isa. 1.6.  In the same sence is Moses to be understood where he saith to Israel, <em class="underline">The Lord shal smite thee in the knees &amp; in the leggs with a sore botch which cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head</em> Deut 28 35. For the sore here spoken of is a plague of war as is manifest by the context. So Moses <a id="l1303"></a>saith to Israel: <em class="underline">Thou shall lend unto many nations &amp; thou shalt <a id="l1304"></a>not borrow. And the Lord shall make thee the head &amp; not the tail <a id="l1305"></a>&amp; thou shalt be above only &amp; thou shalt not be beneath; if thou <a id="l1306"></a>wilt hearken unto the commandments of the Lord – otherwise the <a id="l1307"></a>stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high <a id="l1308"></a>&amp; thou shalt come down very low: He shall lend to thee &amp; thou <a id="l1309"></a>shalt not lend to him; he shall be head &amp; thou shalt be the tail.</em> Deut <a id="l1310"></a>28.12, 44. <em class="underline">The Lord will cut off from Israel head &amp; tail, branch <a id="l1311"></a>&amp; rush in one day. The ancient &amp; honourable he is the head &amp; the <a id="l1312"></a>Prophet that teacheth lyes he is the tail</em> Isa. 9.14, 15 &amp; 19.15. So also <a id="l1313"></a>the Captains are said to be in the head of the people Deut. 20.9, &amp; the rear <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p028r"> &lt;28r&gt; </span> of an army is called the tail Iosh. 10.19. <em class="underline">If one dream he rides <a id="l1314"></a>on Pharas</em> (that is a generous steed) <em class="underline">having a thick set &amp; long <a id="l1315"></a>tail he shall have a train of attendants or followers answerable <a id="l1316"></a>to the fullness &amp; length of the tail.</em> Achm. c. 152. ffrom all which it <a id="l1317"></a>is easy to understand that the army of Euphratean horsmen whose tails <a id="l1318"></a>were like unto serpents &amp; had heads signify an army of both <a id="l1319"></a>hors &amp; foot, their tails representing the train of the Army on foot <a id="l1320"></a>&amp; the heads of the tails being the commanders of the foot. ffor with <a id="l1321"></a>their tails they did hurt (Apoc. 9.19,) &amp; all fighting Men refer to <a id="l1322"></a>armies. And for the same reason the tails of the Locusts like scor<a id="l1323"></a>pions with stings in them Apoc. 9.5, 10 &amp; the tail of the Dragon wherewith <a id="l1324"></a>he drew the third part of the stars to the earth must signify their <a id="l1325"></a>armies. ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 27v &gt; </span> ✝ Tis true that the parts of Nebuchadnezzar's Image from the head to the <a id="l1326"></a>foot  refer not to the office &amp; dignity of the <a id="l1327"></a>things signified but to the order of time: but this is singular &amp; seems to argue <a id="l1328"></a>that the Image at its first appearance rose up gradually,  as the beasts of <a id="l1329"></a>Daniel &amp; Iohn did, out of the earth or sea.</p>
<p id="par82">So then a head signifies the governing part of a Kingdom. And there<a id="l1330"></a>fore when a beast has more heads then one they must signify a distinction <a id="l1331"></a>or division of the Kingdom into so many Dynasties Dominions or particular <a id="l1332"></a>Kingdoms, or in Daniels language, into so many Kings, whether collateral or <a id="l1333"></a>successive. So the three heads of the Eagle in 2 Esdr. 12.22, 23 are there <a id="l1334"></a>interpreted to signify three kingdoms, &amp; the four heads of Daniel Leopard –<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 28r resumes &gt; </span>  the four heads of <a id="l1337"></a>Daniel's Leopard are the four Kings or Kingdoms into which the Greek <a id="l1338"></a>Empire was divided towards the four winds Dan. 11.4, as is also signi<a id="l1339"></a>fied by the four horns of the Goat which the Angel calls four Kingdoms. And so the seven heads of the <a id="l1340"></a>Apocalyptick Dragon &amp; Beast being successive  signify a distinction of  their Kingdom into seven suc<a id="l1341"></a>cessive Kings  Dominions or Dynasties.  For the Angel calls them seven Kings  &amp; describes some of them successive, Apoc. 17.10. ffor as the seven <a id="l1343"></a>ears of corn &amp; seven kine &amp; the three bunches of grapes &amp; <a id="l1344"></a>three baskets in the dreams of Pharaoh &amp; his servants signify <a id="l1345"></a>successive years &amp; days, so may the heads of a Beast be interpreted <a id="l1346"></a>of successive times. Some interpreting the Apocalyptick Beast of the Roman <a id="l1347"></a>Empire take the seven heads to be seven forms or sorts of government, <a id="l1348"></a>Kings, Consuls, Decemviri, Tribunes of the Soldiers with Consular <a id="l1349"></a>power, Dictators, Emperors, &amp; a seventh which they are not well <a id="l1350"></a>agreed upon. But this is wholy against the use of the word. ffor heads <a id="l1351"></a>signify  the Kings themselves not the modes or forms of Kings, &amp; become new ones as often as there arise new Kings whether  <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>these<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> new ones agree with or differ from any of the former in form. Different forms may argue different Kings &amp; heads: but the same fforms will not argue distinct &amp; separate reigns to be the same head. ffor the Leop<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ards<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> heads were all of the same form &amp; yet different  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 28v &gt; </span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 28r resumes &gt; </span> <a id="l1378"></a>Had the aforesaid forms of the Roman Empire succeeded one another in order so that there had been <a id="l1379"></a>but six changes of government the opinion  might have been  reasonable: but while there were more then twenty changes, the government <a id="l1381"></a>by Tribunes Consuls &amp; Dictators being often revived; to number the heads <a id="l1382"></a>not by the changes of government but by the variety of sorts or modes, so as to <a id="l1383"></a>take all the government by Consuls both before &amp; after those by Decemviri <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p029r"> &lt;29r&gt; </span> Tribunes &amp; Dictators for but one head &amp; all that <a id="l1384"></a>by Tribunes both before &amp; after many Consuls &amp; Dicta<a id="l1385"></a>tors for another &amp; all that by Dictators set up now <a id="l1386"></a>&amp; then by fits for a third is a fansy which I  <a id="l1387"></a>must leave to them to maintain who serve an Hypo<a id="l1388"></a>thesis. For they may as well tell me that all the <a id="l1389"></a>Kingdoms which succeeded Alexander in the Greek Em<a id="l1390"></a>pire were but one head of the Leopard because they <a id="l1391"></a>differed not in form of government. And besides <a id="l1392"></a>this some of those governments were past long be<a id="l1393"></a>fore the Roman dominion began to be considered in <a id="l1394"></a>  Prophesy or to make any figure in the world &amp; <a id="l1395"></a>the government by  Kings Dictators &amp; Em<a id="l1396"></a>perors are monarchical &amp; differ in nothing but <a id="l1397"></a>the name. Every King leading an army is an Em<a id="l1398"></a>peror &amp; every Emperor ruling a peole is a king, <a id="l1399"></a>&amp; every Dictator is a King during his Dictatorship. <a id="l1400"></a>The Greeks called the Roman Emperors βασιλεις Kings, <a id="l1401"></a>&amp; we the Kings of Persia Emperors &amp; Charles the <a id="l1402"></a>great changed the name of King for Holy Emperor <a id="l1403"></a>without any change at all of the form or mode <a id="l1404"></a>of the government of his kingdom. The Pope gave <a id="l1405"></a>him nothing but a new name.</p>
<p id="par83">Porphyrius to elude &amp; overthrow the authority <a id="l1406"></a>of Daniel's prophesy appointed his fourth Beast to the <a id="l1407"></a>successors of Alexander the great: which being allowed, <a id="l1408"></a>, the <a id="l1409"></a>Leopard would have no heads at all, &amp; the fourth <a id="l1410"></a>Beast would have four unless heads signify something else then we have affirmed.. But this opinion of Porphy<a id="l1411"></a>rius, as tis contrary to the constant opinion of all the <a id="l1412"></a>ancient churches, so it has been so effectually confuted <a id="l1413"></a>by several writers, &amp; the fourth Beast so plainly <a id="l1414"></a>shewn to be the Roman Empire that I do not think <a id="l1415"></a>it pertinent to spend words about this mattter. According <a id="l1416"></a>to Porphyrius the Leopard's four heads &amp;  wings which ought <a id="l1417"></a>to signify so many kingdoms can signify nothing there being but one kingdom of the Greeks during the reign of Alexander: the fourth Beast <a id="l1418"></a>which ought to be fierce &amp; terrible &amp; strong above the <a id="l1419"></a>three former Dan 7. will be weaker then they Dan 8 &amp; 11: the <a id="l1420"></a>ten horns which ought to be ten kingdoms will be but ten <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030r"> &lt;30r&gt; </span> single Kings or rather twelve, there being so many <a id="l1421"></a>Kings of Egypt &amp; Syria before the reign of Antiochus <a id="l1422"></a>Epiphanes: the little horn which ought to have been of <a id="l1423"></a>a different kind from the rest &amp; to have rooted up <a id="l1424"></a>three of them  &amp;  changed times &amp; laws three years and an half will be of the same kind <a id="l1425"></a>with the rest as root up none of them &amp;  change the laws only three years 1 Mac. 1.54 &amp; 4 52: &amp; the fift <a id="l1426"></a>Kingdom which was to be greatest &amp; stand for ever &amp; ruin <a id="l1427"></a>the fourth, will either be that of the Maccabees which <a id="l1428"></a>was contemptible &amp; of short continuance &amp; did not ruin <a id="l1429"></a>the fourth, or that spiritual one of the Christians <a id="l1430"></a>which began almost 200 years after the little horn <a id="l1431"></a>was vanquished &amp; some years after that Beast was also <a id="l1432"></a>ceased &amp; so ruined neither. And besides these absurdities <a id="l1433"></a>the ten horned Beasts of Daniel &amp; Iohn will be different, <a id="l1434"></a>whereas Iohn tells you that his <em class="underline">Beast was like unto <a id="l1435"></a>the Leopard &amp; his feet as the feet of the Bear &amp; his <a id="l1436"></a>mouth as the mouth of the Lion</em> Apoc. 13.2. He names Da<a id="l1437"></a>niel's three first Beasts in order backward &amp; to shew <a id="l1438"></a>that the Apocalyptic Beast is of their kindred &amp; the fourth <a id="l1439"></a>of them he assimilates him to them &amp; puts him in the <a id="l1440"></a>fourth place in the room of Daniel's fourth. He was like <a id="l1441"></a>the Leopard that is fierce &amp; terrible: his feet were <a id="l1442"></a>as the feet of the Bear that is flat &amp; fitted to stamp <a id="l1443"></a>things with in fighting as a Bear doth: his mouth was <a id="l1444"></a>as the mouth of the Lion that is armed with great  &amp; long teeth to tear &amp; devour as a Lion doth: And <a id="l1446"></a>by partaking of all these qualities he was neither Lion, Bear <a id="l1447"></a>nor Leopard but a strong monster of a different species: &amp; <a id="l1448"></a>besides this he rose out of the sea, &amp; had ten horns, &amp; reigned <a id="l1449"></a>42 months or three  years &amp; an half, &amp; was cast into <a id="l1450"></a>the lake of fire &amp; the time of his end  was when the <a id="l1451"></a>Word of God came in heaven with many crowns on his head <a id="l1452"></a>to rule the nations with a rod of iron &amp; reward the saints <a id="l1453"></a>in judgment. All which things are the manifest character of <a id="l1454"></a>Daniel's fourth Beast. ffor that Beast was dreadfull &amp; terri<a id="l1455"></a>ble &amp; strong exceedingly &amp; had great iron teeth &amp; brake <a id="l1456"></a>in pieces &amp; stamped the residue with his feet, &amp; was divers <a id="l1457"></a>from all the Beasts that were before it &amp; rose out of <a id="l1458"></a>the great sea &amp; had ten horns &amp; reigned with his little horn <a id="l1459"></a>three times &amp; an half &amp; was cast into the burning flames <a id="l1460"></a>&amp; the time of his end was when the judgment was set &amp; <a id="l1461"></a>the books were opened &amp; the Son of man came in the clouds of <a id="l1462"></a>heaven to receive an universal &amp; everlasting dominion that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p031r"> &lt;31r&gt; </span> nations should serve him. In short the fourth Beast agrees <a id="l1463"></a>in all things to the Romans in nothing to the Greeks &amp; there<a id="l1464"></a>fore the heads &amp; wings of the third Beast must be applied <a id="l1465"></a>to Alexander's successors. For those successors even Daniel <a id="l1466"></a>himself in two other prophesies divides into four Kingdoms <a id="l1467"></a>answering to these heads &amp; wings, Dan. 8.8, 22 &amp; 11.4. <a id="l1468"></a>So then  Heads are a type of Kingdoms.</p>

<p id="par85">Now the head signifying the honourable part of the <a id="l1469"></a>kingdom, the several parts of the head as the horns, eyes, <a id="l1470"></a>mouth &amp; teeth must referr to the honourable men of <a id="l1471"></a>several faculties together with their mystical bodies <a id="l1472"></a>of their proper attendants &amp; ministers, &amp; the rest of <a id="l1473"></a>the body with the tail &amp; feet to the rest of the people. <a id="l1474"></a>A Horn therefore signifies the Captains &amp; martial great <a id="l1475"></a>men of the Kingdom invested with their mystical bodies <a id="l1476"></a>of soldiers &amp; united under one general Commander. <a id="l1477"></a>ffor as it is the highest part of the head so it is a <a id="l1478"></a>fighting member wherewith a Beast or Kingdom pushes <a id="l1479"></a>its enemies &amp; defends it self. So Ezekiel comparing <a id="l1480"></a>Israel to a flock of Rams &amp; the heathen kingdoms to <a id="l1481"></a>Goats &amp; describing the dispersion of the one by the <a id="l1482"></a>other saith, <em class="underline">Ye have pusht all the diseased with <a id="l1483"></a>your horns till ye have scattered them</em>, Ezek. 34.21. <a id="l1484"></a><em class="underline">And Zedekiah – made him horns of iron &amp; said to <a id="l1485"></a>the King of Israel – With these thou shalt push the <a id="l1486"></a>Assyrians untill thou have consumed them</em> 1 King. 22.11 <a id="l1487"></a><em class="underline">Arise, thresh o daughter of Zion: I will make thy hoofs <a id="l1488"></a>brass &amp; thy horns iron &amp; thou shalt beat in pieces many <a id="l1489"></a>people</em>, Micah 4.13. Hence God is called the horn of David <a id="l1490"></a> &amp; Christ the horn of Israel to save them from their <a id="l1491"></a>enemies (Psal. 18.2. Luke 1.69, 71.) but properly a horn is <a id="l1492"></a>considered as the member of a Beast or Kingdom &amp; refers <a id="l1493"></a>to martial men. So the horn of a King 1 Sam. 2.10, Psal. <a id="l1494"></a>89.24 &amp; of a Kingdom Ier. 48.25, Lam. 2.3, 17 <a id="l1495"></a>is their military force as the contexts shew. And <a id="l1496"></a>Moses tells you expresly that a Horn signifies an Army. <a id="l1497"></a><em class="underline">The glory of Ioseph</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">is the firstling of his <a id="l1498"></a>bullock &amp; his horns are the horns of a wild bull: <a id="l1499"></a>with them he shall push the people together to the <a id="l1500"></a>ends of the earth, &amp; they are the ten thousands of <a id="l1501"></a>Ephraim &amp; they are the thousands of Manasseh</em>, <a id="l1502"></a>Deut. 33.17.</p>
<p id="par86">So then a horn is an Army &amp; the horn or horns of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p032r"> &lt;32r&gt; </span> a people or kingdom is the army or armies thereof, including the supreme Commanders whether Princes Kings or Emperors. <a id="l1503"></a>And when the horns of any people are numbred, they <a id="l1504"></a>signify so many distinct &amp; independant armies, that is <a id="l1505"></a>the armies of so many several Tribes or Principali<a id="l1506"></a>ties or Kingdoms in that people, &amp;  therefore rise <a id="l1507"></a>&amp; are broken of not with the Commanders Princes <a id="l1508"></a>&amp; Kings but with the  military forces of those Tribes <a id="l1509"></a>Principalities or Kingdoms,  &amp; by consequence with the Kingdoms <a id="l1510"></a>themselves. So in Zech. 1.19, 21, the four horns which <a id="l1511"></a>scattered Iudah seem to signify the armies of the four <a id="l1512"></a>Monarchies represented in Daniel by four Beasts. And so <a id="l1513"></a>in Daniel &amp; Iohn the number rise &amp; fall of the <a id="l1514"></a>Kingdoms in any Beast is signified by the number rise <a id="l1515"></a>&amp; fall of  the horns of that beast, For the <a id="l1516"></a>horns are called Kings &amp; interpreted of Kingdoms, that is <a id="l1517"></a>with  respect to their military powers.</p>
<p id="par87">For thô Beasts &amp; their heads &amp; horns are all <a id="l1518"></a>of them called Kings yet there's a considerable differ<a id="l1519"></a>ence in the reason of their significations. ffor a Beast includes <a id="l1520"></a>both the head &amp; body of the Kingdom, a Head the Horns <a id="l1521"></a>Eyes &amp; Mouth of the Kingdom but not the body &amp; a <a id="l1522"></a>Horn neither the body nor the eyes &amp; mouth. Where <a id="l1523"></a>there is no difference considered between the common <a id="l1524"></a>people of several kingdoms, there those kingdoms <a id="l1525"></a>may be represented by one &amp; the same body &amp; tail <a id="l1526"></a>of a beast with so many several heads as there are <a id="l1527"></a>kingdoms; as was done in Daniel's Leopard. Where there <a id="l1528"></a>is no difference considered in the mind &amp; counsel of <a id="l1529"></a>several kingdoms, there it is not necessary that the <a id="l1530"></a>Beast which signifies them should have several Heads. <a id="l1531"></a>He may have but one head with so many horns on it <a id="l1532"></a>as there are kingdoms; as in the cases of the Goat &amp; <a id="l1533"></a>ten horned Beasts of Daniel &amp; Iohn. ffor the horns <a id="l1534"></a>of Iohn's Beast received power as Kings the same hour <a id="l1535"></a>with the last head of that Beast &amp; therefore grew <a id="l1536"></a>all upon that head. They had one mind (Apoc 17. <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) <a id="l1537"></a>&amp; therefore one head &amp; one blaspheming mouth of <a id="l1538"></a>that head (Apoc 13 <span class="hspac-n" title="4 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) was sufficient for them all. But <a id="l1539"></a>the eleventh horn of Daniel's Beast being divers from <a id="l1540"></a>the other ten, has therefore eyes &amp; a mouth peculiar <a id="l1541"></a>to himself as if he had a different soul. Which shews <a id="l1542"></a>sufficiently that a horn doth not properly include the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p033r"> &lt;33r&gt; </span> eyes &amp; mouth of a Kingdom as a head doth unless they be <a id="l1543"></a>exprest. A Beast is the whole Kingdom, his head the <a id="l1544"></a>whole governing part thereof &amp; his horns the whole military <a id="l1545"></a>part of the government, &amp; all these are kings because they <a id="l1546"></a>include both the power &amp; persons of kings. For a horn <a id="l1547"></a>being the highest part of the head doth not only signi<a id="l1548"></a>fy the martial force but also the height &amp; glory of the <a id="l1549"></a>Kingdom. Whence the exalting of a horn is put for the <a id="l1550"></a>exalting of a Kingdom as in 1 Sam. 2.10. Psal. 89.17 &amp; other <a id="l1551"></a>places. And accordingly Daniel represents the growth of his <a id="l1552"></a>Goat in might &amp; glory by the growing up of its little <a id="l1553"></a>horn to heaven. And for this reason a Horn includes the <a id="l1554"></a>person of the King not only as soveraign Commander of <a id="l1555"></a>the military force but also as the highest person in the <a id="l1556"></a>kingdom. So then a horn signifies properly the aggregate of <a id="l1557"></a>men wherein the military power &amp; dominion of a kingdom <a id="l1558"></a>is seated including the person of the King: &amp; therefore <a id="l1559"></a>the number of horns in any Beast signifies  <a id="l1560"></a>properly the number of supreme military Dominions in <a id="l1561"></a>any great body of men represented by a Beast, &amp; the <a id="l1562"></a>rise &amp; fall of Horns signifies the rising &amp; falling of <a id="l1563"></a>such Dominions &amp; by consequence of Kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par88">Some hearing the horns of Daniel's Beasts to be <a id="l1564"></a>called Kings have taken them for Kings in the language <a id="l1565"></a>of the vulgar, that is for single persons: which they could <a id="l1566"></a>never have done had they understood the language of <a id="l1567"></a>the Prophets. The single persons of Kings are not the <a id="l1568"></a>forces of Kingdoms. They are not the members where<a id="l1569"></a>with Kingdoms fight &amp; push one another &amp; therefore <a id="l1570"></a>cannot be the horns of their kingdoms. Daniels Kings are <a id="l1571"></a>Kingdoms or at least  such ruling powers  as  by the ordi<a id="l1572"></a>nary figures of Rhetorick may be called Kingdoms. The <a id="l1573"></a>four Beasts are Kings in his language &amp; yet by his own <a id="l1574"></a>interpretation they are Kingdoms. His Ram with two horns <a id="l1575"></a>is called the Kings of Media &amp; Persia  Dan. 8.20 <a id="l1576"></a>&amp; yet the Ram neither signifies single persons nor were <a id="l1577"></a>the Kingdoms of Media &amp; Persia subject to any more <a id="l1578"></a>then one King when the Goat brake his two horns. <a id="l1579"></a>Those horns therefore signify the dominions or kingdoms <a id="l1580"></a>of Media &amp; Perisa without any respect to the person of <a id="l1581"></a>the King. His Goat is also called the King of Greece vers <a id="l1582"></a>21 &amp; yet was a Kingdom conteining many Kings repre<a id="l1583"></a>sented by his horns, four of which are expressly inter<a id="l1584"></a>preted of Kingdoms vers 22: &amp; the first &amp; last must be <a id="l1585"></a>of the same kind thô called Kings. For in one &amp; the same <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p034r"> &lt;34r&gt; </span> prophesy &amp; in one &amp; the same sentence of that Prophesy <a id="l1586"></a>to  interpret one horn of a kingdom &amp; another of <a id="l1587"></a>a single person is such a liberty as is never allowed <a id="l1588"></a>in common speaking nor can be allowed in the scriptures <a id="l1589"></a>without  straining to serve an hypothesis. <a id="l1590"></a>Tis by this shamelesse liberty of multiplying the sig<a id="l1591"></a>nification of words &amp; types that Interpreters have <a id="l1592"></a>made the scriptures seem so uncertain &amp; hard to be <a id="l1593"></a> understood &amp; therefore he that will understand them truly <a id="l1594"></a>must not admit it. If the great horn was the first <a id="l1595"></a>King tis in respect of the following  horns &amp; therefore <a id="l1596"></a>they are  also Kings &amp; if these Kings are Kingdoms then <a id="l1597"></a>Kings here signify Kingdoms &amp; so the first &amp; last horn <a id="l1598"></a>must be kingdoms as well as the other four. All these <a id="l1599"></a>Kings are of a kind because numbered together, for equi<a id="l1600"></a>vocals are never connumerated. To call a man the <a id="l1601"></a>first King &amp; kingdoms the next kings is against all <a id="l1602"></a>rules of speaking. When the first horn was broken <a id="l1603"></a>off the four next stood up for it &amp; therefore are <a id="l1604"></a>of the same kind: for the person of Alexander the <a id="l1605"></a>great was not succeeded by kingdoms but by persons <a id="l1606"></a>&amp; his kingdom by kingdoms. Compare this prophesy <a id="l1607"></a>with that of Dan. 11.4, &amp; the interpretation will <a id="l1608"></a>be evident. ffor the breaking of the great horn is <a id="l1609"></a>there called the breaking of the Kingdom &amp; dividing <a id="l1610"></a>it towards the four winds of heaven; &amp; therefore <a id="l1611"></a>this horn is  a Kingdom. So then the two horns of the Ram <a id="l1613"></a>&amp; the five first horns of the Goat were kingdoms; &amp; <a id="l1614"></a>there is the same reason of the last;  for the <a id="l1620"></a>horns are all of a kind. But what kingdom is signified <a id="l1621"></a>by this last horn I shall describe hereafter. So then by <a id="l1622"></a>the  common consent of  Moses Daniel &amp; other <a id="l1623"></a>Prophets, horns signify not the  single persons <a id="l1624"></a>of kings but their military powers dominions &amp; kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par89">Some reading  in the Apocalyps that the ten <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p035r"> &lt;35r&gt; </span> horns gave their kingdom to the Beast have fansied the <a id="l1625"></a>Beast to be a kingdom distinct from his horns &amp; the horns <a id="l1626"></a>alone without their body politique represented by the <a id="l1627"></a>Beast to be complete kingdoms: which is altogether against <a id="l1628"></a>the tenour of the Prophetic language: for this is to de<a id="l1629"></a>prive the Beast of his martial forces &amp; make his armies <a id="l1630"></a>to be kingdoms distinct from himself. Tis to make him fight <a id="l1631"></a>with the armies of other kingdoms &amp; push with horns which <a id="l1632"></a>are not his own. The ten horns in giving their kingdom <a id="l1633"></a>to the Beast did not give away their Kingdom from them <a id="l1634"></a>selves to another King, but each gave his kingdom to <a id="l1635"></a>the body politic compounded of them all &amp; by this <a id="l1636"></a>gift their kingdom became the Kingdom of the Beast <a id="l1637"></a>without ceasing to be their own. Should ten men agree <a id="l1638"></a>to become Merchants &amp; found a Company, each might <a id="l1639"></a>be said to give his estate or any part thereof to the <a id="l1640"></a>Company thó there were no Company distinct from them <a id="l1641"></a>selves. And the case is the same  with the ten horns.</p>
<p id="par90">If it be said that the Beast is distinguished from <a id="l1642"></a>his horns as another King where he &amp; the Kings of the <a id="l1643"></a>earth &amp; their armies war against the Word of God <a id="l1644"></a>&amp; against his army Apoc. 19: I answer that there are <a id="l1645"></a>other Kings of the earth besides the ten horns;  as the <a id="l1646"></a>Dragon  then in being Apoc. 16.13 &amp; 20.2 &amp; the Kings <a id="l1647"></a>of the east whose way was prepared to this battel <a id="l1648"></a>Apoc. 10.12. The horns went with the Beast into the <a id="l1649"></a>lake of fire as members of his body, but the Kings <a id="l1650"></a>of the earth were (politically) slain with the two edged <a id="l1651"></a>sword Apoc. 19.21. For these Kings are the rest of Dani<a id="l1652"></a>els Beasts which had their dominions taken away <a id="l1653"></a>&amp; their natural lives prolongued when the fourth <a id="l1654"></a>Beast was given to the burning flames, Dan. 7.12. ffor <a id="l1655"></a>when the stone cut out of the mountain fell <a id="l1656"></a>upon the feet of Nebuchadnezzar's Image it brake <a id="l1657"></a>in pieces all the four Monarchies together, the <a id="l1658"></a>gold &amp; the silver &amp; the copper &amp; the iron Dan. 4.<a id="l1659"></a>35, 44 45. So then from these objections there is no reason why we should depart from the tenour of <a id="l1660"></a>the prophetic language. </p>
<p id="par91">Eyes are the light of the body &amp; having <a id="l1661"></a>much the same signification with Candles or Lamps <a id="l1662"></a>they referr to skill understanding &amp; instruction. <a id="l1663"></a>They are therefore in bodies <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p036r"> &lt;36r&gt; </span> in bodies politique Counselours &amp; Politicians, &amp; in bodies Ecclesiastique Teachers <a id="l1664"></a>Seers &amp; Bishops. So the Egyptians to signify that understanding &amp; policy <a id="l1665"></a>ought to be in Kings painted a King by a Scepter with an eye in the top <a id="l1666"></a>of it. But policy being common to all kingdoms 'tis scarce noted in sa<a id="l1667"></a>cred prophesy. There eyes inferr always to religion. So in the Apocalyps <a id="l1668"></a>the four Beasts are full of eyes to represent their understanding and <a id="l1669"></a>quicksightedness in spiritual mysteries. And the Lambs seven eyes are <a id="l1670"></a>called the seven spirits or Angels of the Churches; &amp; signify their Bishops <a id="l1671"></a> represented also by the seven Lamps. So the seers or Prophets and <a id="l1672"></a>Teachers of Gods people under the Law &amp; the Bishops of the Synagogue <a id="l1673"></a>are to be accounted their eyes, &amp; the eyes of the little horn of Daniels <a id="l1674"></a>fourth Beast are fals seers Teachers &amp; Bishops of that horn. Achmet <a id="l1675"></a>tells us that from the doctrine of the Indians that the <em class="underline">eyes are the faith <a id="l1676"></a>sentence &amp; light of the mind: so much as any man dreams to lose of <a id="l1677"></a>his eyesight, so much viciousness he shall have in his faith. And if <a id="l1678"></a>any one dreams that he applies a medicine to his eyes whereby he may <a id="l1679"></a>see better, he shall direct his heart towards God &amp; be solicitous of <a id="l1680"></a>another life</em>. Achm. c. 52. Whence you may understand the meaning <a id="l1681"></a>of the advice given to the Church of Laodicea to annoint her eyes with <a id="l1682"></a>eyesalve that she may see.</p>
<p id="par92">23.  Speaking &amp; hearing are put for commanding &amp; obeying. <em class="underline">I have obeyed the voice of the Lord</em> 1 Sam. 15.20, that is his commandment. <em class="underline">I spake unto you  &amp; ye would not hear but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord</em> Deut 1.43. Ier. 29.19 &amp;c. Whence a Mouth – – mouth refers to a Lawgiver either civil or sacred accord<a id="l1683"></a>ingly as the Beast is a body politique or ecclesiastique that is to a King or Prophet. Thus besides the <a id="l1684"></a>mouth of Daniels fourth Beast common to all the kingdoms signified <a id="l1685"></a>by the horns (Dan. 7) the little horn has another mouth proper to <a id="l1686"></a>himself to signify his having a legislative power of such a kind <a id="l1687"></a>as none of the other horns have. And what that power was is des<a id="l1688"></a>cribed plainly. <em class="underline">He had a mouth speaking very great things</em> vers 20, <a id="l1689"></a><em class="underline">even great words against the most high &amp;</em> [thereby] <em class="underline">wore out the <a id="l1690"></a>saints of the most high &amp; thought to change times &amp; laws &amp; they <a id="l1691"></a>were given into his hand for a time</em>. ver 25. This he did by the <a id="l1692"></a>power of his mouth, which power must be a legislative one &amp; that in matters of <a id="l1693"></a>religion, becasue times &amp; laws were given into his hand to change <a id="l1694"></a>them in opposition to God &amp; the saints This Horn is therefore a fals Prophet.. So where the Image of the  <a id="l1695"></a>Beast Apoc. 13 is said to speak, &amp; cause that as many as would not <a id="l1696"></a>worship the Image should be killed; it must be by some command or law that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p037r"> &lt;37r&gt; </span> they were killed, and the Image is not the Officer that killed them, but the <a id="l1697"></a>author of their being killed, that is the lawmaker, It spake &amp; caused <a id="l1698"></a>them to be killed that would not worship it, that is it spake with authority <a id="l1699"></a>so as to cause them to be killed that would not obey its voice. Speaking <a id="l1700"></a>&amp; causing here are ἕν διὰ δυοιν. So where the two horned Beast spake <a id="l1701"></a>as the Dragon, &amp; the ten horned Beast had a mouth speaking great <a id="l1702"></a>things &amp; blasphemies it is to be understood of the Laws they made.</p>
<p id="par93">The strength or weakness of the voice signifies power or debility. <a id="l1703"></a>Thou shalt be brought down &amp; shalt speak out of the ground &amp; thy <a id="l1704"></a>speech shall be low out of the dust &amp; thy voice shall be as one that hath <a id="l1705"></a>a familiar spirit out of the ground, &amp; thy spirit shall whisper out of the <a id="l1706"></a>dust. Isa. 29.4. They shall lay hold on bow &amp; spear, they are cruel <a id="l1707"></a>&amp; have no mercy, their voice roareth like the sea Ier. 6.23. See Isa <a id="l1708"></a>5.29, 20 &amp; Ier. 51.51. If one dream that his voice is become weak <a id="l1709"></a>&amp; small his life shall be full of grief &amp; affliction Achm. ex Ind. c. 50. <a id="l1710"></a>If one dream that his voice is increased, his children shall become <a id="l1711"></a>prosperous, &amp; if he dream that he is hoarse he shall be contemned of <a id="l1712"></a>his servants. Achm. ex. Pers et Ægypt. c. 51.</p>
<p id="par94">24 That the people of a kingdom are to be understood  by the hair of any <a id="l1713"></a>Animal is apparent in Ezekiel who by his hair divided into three <a id="l1714"></a>parts  represents the people of Ierusalem chap. 5. If a King dreams <a id="l1715"></a>that his hair becomes gray, his people shall become weak – if he <a id="l1716"></a>dreams that his hair is neat &amp; copious, his people shall have joy &amp; secu<a id="l1717"></a>rity by victory Achm. ex Pers. c. 21. If a King dreams that his hair <a id="l1718"></a>comes off in combing his people shall be weakned, &amp; if he dreams that <a id="l1719"></a>he cuts off his hair, his army shall be diminished according to the <a id="l1720"></a>measure of his hair cut off. Achm. ex Ægypt. c. 22. If a King dreams <a id="l1721"></a>that he colours his har, he shall study to adorn his people by lying. Achm. <a id="l1722"></a>ex Pers &amp; Ægypt. c. 38. So in the Apocalyps the hairs of the Son of man <a id="l1723"></a>white as snow represent his people cloathed in fair linnen clean &amp; <a id="l1724"></a>white: which linnen is the righteousness of the Saints Apoc. 19.8.

<p id="par95">Whence  stretching forth of wings signify the stretching forth of the people of a kingdom <a id="l1726"></a>into several regions by invasion or conquest.

<p id="par96">25 The fighting members of a pugnacious Beast as teeth, nailes, feet &amp; serpen<a id="l1732"></a>tine tailes are evidently enough the types of armies &amp; squadrons <a id="l1733"></a>of armies, so the fourth Beast in Daniel is represented with great <a id="l1734"></a>iron teeth &amp; nailes of brass, for devouring &amp; breaking &amp; tearing <a id="l1735"></a>in pieces, &amp; so the army of Locusts Ioel. 1.6 &amp; Apoc. 9.8 are re<a id="l1736"></a>presented with teeth of Lyons. And probably the author of the fable <a id="l1737"></a>of Cadmus had respect to this signification of teeth when he made <a id="l1738"></a>the Dragons teeth to be the seed of armed soldiers. So Daniel's fourth <a id="l1739"></a>Beast stamped things with his feet &amp; for that end had his feet armed with <a id="l1740"></a>nailes of brass &amp; his He Goat stamped upon the Ram; &amp; therefore also <a id="l1741"></a>fought with his feet. And Micah represents the daughter of Zion by a beast fighting with horns &amp; hoofs. <em class="underline">Arise &amp; thresh o daughter of Zion: I will make thy horn Iron &amp; I will make thy hoofs brass &amp; thou shalt beat in pieces many people.</em> Micah 4.13. And that of Ezekiel 32.2 Thou troublest the waters <a id="l1742"></a>with thy feet the Chald. Paraphrast renders thus, Thou disquietest the <a id="l1743"></a>peoples with thy armies. But a man's teeth signify those of his family &amp; kindred &amp; the hands &amp; feet of private great men are their servants. Achm. c. 41, 113, 114, 115. Yet his arm signifies strength &amp; power &amp; the arm or arms of a king are put for the martial power of a kingdom. They made them cease by arm &amp; power  <em class="underline">They</em> [Moab &amp; Amon &amp;c.] <em class="underline">have been confederate against thee.

<p id="par98">26 The bones of a Beast refer to the strength &amp; fortified cities of the <a id="l1751"></a>Kingdom &amp; the flesh to the riches: So where Ieremiah saith, <em class="underline">He hath <a id="l1752"></a>sent fire into my bones &amp; it prevaileth against them</em>: The Chalde <a id="l1753"></a>Paraphrast renders, <em class="underline">He hath sent fire</em> [that is war] <em class="underline">into my cities &amp; <a id="l1754"></a>subdued them</em> Lam. 1.13.  So where Ieremiah saith of Iudah that <a id="l1755"></a><em class="underline">Nebuchadnezzar hath broken his bones</em> Ier. 50.13, the meaning is <a id="l1756"></a>that Nebuchadnezzar hath expugned his fenced cities.  And where <a id="l1757"></a>the second of Daniel's four Beasts had three ribs in the mouth be<a id="l1758"></a>tween the teeth it seems to respect the imperial cities of three king<a id="l1759"></a>doms Media Persia &amp; Babylonia. Concerning flesh Achmet saith <a id="l1760"></a>If any one seem to find or eat the flesh of Dragons he shall receive <a id="l1761"></a>riches proportionally from some great King c. 283 ex Ind. Pers, Ægypt. <a id="l1762"></a>And if he eat the flesh of a scorpion he shall receive the wealth of an <a id="l1763"></a>enemy c. 285. The like of the flesh of other Beasts in c. 269, 272, <a id="l1764"></a>274 &amp; c. And if his own flesh seem to grow plump he shall grow rich <a id="l1765"></a>proportionally c. 87 ex Ind. And in general he saies the Indians teach <a id="l1766"></a>that flesh does universally signify riches &amp; gold. So the Chal. Par. for: They shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm Isa. 9.20 translates: They shall <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p043r"> &lt;43r&gt; </span> prey every man upon the substance of his neighbour. And so for: The <a id="l1767"></a>fatness of his flesh shall wax lean Isa. 17.4. he translates: The <a id="l1768"></a>wealth wherein his glory consisted shall pass away. So to signify the great <a id="l1769"></a>wealth which the Kings of  Persia should heap up it is said to the <a id="l1770"></a>second Beast: Arise, devour much flesh Dan. 7.5. And the spoiling of the Egyptians by the Israelites is expressed by giving the Leviathan to be meat <a id="l1771"></a>for them in the wilderness Psal. 74.13. See also Ezek. 29.5. And so in the <a id="l1772"></a>Apocalyps where the ten Kings hate the whore &amp; eat her flesh &amp; burn her <a id="l1773"></a>with fire, 'tis to be understood that they seize her wealth &amp; consume her <a id="l1774"></a>by war. And the like of the ffowls of heaven being filled with the flesh of <a id="l1775"></a>Kings &amp; Captains &amp; mighty men &amp;c. Apoc. 20. And the same is to be <a id="l1776"></a>understood in the tradition of the Iews of their feasting in the day of the <a id="l1777"></a>Messiah on two great Beasts Leviathan &amp; Behemoth, these Beasts <a id="l1778"></a>being the types of Kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par99">‡ Whilst short lived Beasts are put in sacred prophesies for long lived Kingdoms <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 39r &gt; </span> ‡ Whilst short lived Beasts are put in sacred prophiesies for long lived Kingdoms its ne<a id="l1779"></a>cessary that the short times of their lives measured by the heaven<a id="l1780"></a>ly bodies should be put for the longer times of Kingdoms. So  in the Apocalyps <a id="l1781"></a>where the Locusts continue five months &amp; the  Beast 42 months &amp; the woman <a id="l1782"></a>is fed 1260 days [&amp; the witnesses  prophesy all that time &amp; lye <a id="l1783"></a>dead 3 days &amp; an half]  since these short lived creatures are put for long <a id="l1784"></a>lived bodies politique (as we shall presently shew) the short times of these creatures must in reason signify <a id="l1785"></a>much longer times of those bodies. Whence the ancient sages had more sorts of <a id="l1786"></a>days weeks months &amp; years then one. They had their vulgar years &amp; their great <a id="l1787"></a>years, vulgar months &amp; great months, weeks of days &amp; weeks of years, natural <a id="l1788"></a>days &amp; days mystical. And therefore where the  things prophesied of are mystical its proper to understand their times in a mystical sense.  Tis impossible that in the short time of three natural days &amp; an half the peoples, Kindred, <a id="l1793"></a>tongues &amp; nations that make up the Beast, should see the dead bodies of the two <a id="l1794"></a>witnesses &amp; they that dwell on the earth (all that worship him chap. 13.7, 8) rejoyce <a id="l1795"></a>over them &amp; make merry (that is by feasting) &amp; send gifts to one another because <a id="l1796"></a> the Prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth. Tis inconsistent with the <a id="l1797"></a>wisdome &amp; majesty of sacred Prophesy to pass over all the long afflictions &amp; <a id="l1798"></a>persecutions of the several churches &amp; predict  with great solemnity  how <a id="l1799"></a>the Church of Smyrna shall suffer a tribulation of ten days if those days be <a id="l1800"></a>only natural ones. Tis altogether impossible that within the 1290 &amp; 1335 days <a id="l1801"></a>in Dan 12, which extend from the setting up the abomination Dan 11.31 to the end of the <a id="l1802"></a>prophesy &amp; to  the resurrection  of  the dead, unless those days be mystical, all the vicissitudes <a id="l1803"></a>there described concerning the valour &amp; sufferings of the saints, the King that <a id="l1804"></a>should do according to his will &amp; the Kings of the south &amp; north &amp; their sucessive <a id="l1805"></a>conquests &amp; fall &amp;  after this the  time of great trouble should be <a id="l1806"></a>comprehended.</p>
<p id="par100">Know therefore that in sacred prophesy a day is put for any long  time &amp; both days &amp; times in the plural number are put <a id="l1807"></a>for years. So Christ calls his life time his day Iohn 8.56 &amp; every man's <a id="l1808"></a>life time his day (Iohn 9.4) &amp; Iob the life time of the wicked his day <a id="l1809"></a>(Iob 18.20) #<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 39v &gt; </span> # Iob. 18.20 &amp; Ieremy interprets the day of the visitation of Babylon <a id="l1810"></a>to be the time thereof Ier. 50.27, 31 &amp; in the Psalms the day of temp<a id="l1811"></a>tation in the wilderness is interpreted to be forty years Psal 95.8, 9, 10 <a id="l1812"></a>&amp; Ezekiel calls the time of Iuda's prosperity the day of their pride <a id="l1813"></a>Ezek 10.56 &amp; the time of Iuda's captivity &amp; distress is called the day <a id="l1814"></a>thereof Obad. 11.12, 13, 14. Lament. 1.12 &amp; the latter times are frequently <a id="l1815"></a>called the latter day &amp; the time of the last Iudgment the day of judgment<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 39r resumes &gt; </span> – – – –  &amp; the time <a id="l1816"></a>of judgment  the day of judgment. So then  days are times <a id="l1817"></a> Now times in the pl. number  according to the language of Daniel &amp; Iohn are   years. ffor Daniel uses 7 times for seven years (chap. 4) &amp;  both he <a id="l1819"></a> &amp; Iohn use thre times  &amp; an half  for 3 years &amp; <a id="l1820"></a>an half, as you may see in  the Apocalyps (ch. 17) where  a time times &amp; <a id="l1821"></a>half a time are put  equipollent to 1260 days.  Tis true that days <a id="l1822"></a>are sometimes used for longer times as where the six days of the week <a id="l1823"></a>are by the Iews  taken for a type of the worlds continung six <a id="l1824"></a>thousand years. And so the six days of the Creation may signify not only <a id="l1825"></a>six years but even six thousand years as the Tyrrhenian Historian in <a id="l1826"></a>Suidas [in voce τυ᾽ρρ῾ηνία]  affirms, or any other six long times. ffor the <a id="l1827"></a>history of the creation is not in all things litteral. In that Paradise <a id="l1828"></a>the flaming sword &amp; trees of life &amp; knowledge may be as much figurative <a id="l1829"></a>descriptions of something we now understand not as the tree of life is in <a id="l1830"></a>the Paradise to come, &amp; in a parabolical description of the creation a <a id="l1831"></a>day may be used figuratively as well as other things are especially since there was no light till the end of the first day nor sun till the fourth – . ‡<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 39v &gt; </span> ‡ to make natural days. The evenings &amp; mornings of Moses respect all parts of the earth alike so that <a id="l1832"></a>it was evening all over the earth in the beginning of each day of Moses &amp; morning all <a id="l1833"></a>over it in the end of each day: &amp; therefore his evenings &amp; mornings were not  natural <a id="l1834"></a>ones. ffor had they been natural ones it would have been morning in one part of the earth when it was evening in another.</p>
<p id="par101"> Tis also true that the Egyptian &amp; Persian interpreters of dreams take every hour of the <a id="l1835"></a>night for the space of one or two years ( Achmet <a id="l1836"></a>c. 34)  at which recconning  days will signify  longer periods of <a id="l1837"></a>times then  years. But yet Suidas Grammaticus tells us also that the Egypti<a id="l1838"></a>ans called a day a year. And in sacred prophesies – – –<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 39r resumes &gt; </span> But in sacred <a id="l1839"></a>prophesy where there is no manifest reason to the contrary days or times <a id="l1840"></a>are generally taken for years. In Luke 13.32 Christ thus foretells  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p039v"> &lt;39v&gt; </span> his death &amp; resurrecton a good while before it happened: Go &amp; tell that <a id="l1841"></a>Fox  Behold I cast out Devils &amp; do cures to day &amp; to morrow &amp; the third <a id="l1842"></a>day I shall be made perfect. In Amos 4.4 three days are in the <a id="l1843"></a>Hebrew put for three years. In Isa 61 2 &amp; 63.4 a day &amp; a year are used one for <a id="l1844"></a>another. In Num. 14.34 40, days are made a type of 40 years. In Ezek <a id="l1845"></a>4.5, 6 40 days &amp; 390 days are used as types of so many years. In Iona 3.4 <a id="l1846"></a>some conceive the Prophesy of 40 days to have been fulfilled at the end of 40 <a id="l1847"></a>years. In Gen. 29.27 &amp; Dan. 9 weeks are put for sevens of years &amp; <a id="l1848"></a>so in all the Prophesies of Daniel &amp; Iohn to take days for years is much <a id="l1849"></a>more agreable to the nature of the things there prophesied of them to take <a id="l1850"></a>them for natual days.</p>

<p id="par103">And whilst the Prophets put days for years, a short time in their lan<a id="l1852"></a>guage is a long time in the language of the vulgar: as for instance in the <a id="l1853"></a>following passages in the Apocalyps. Behold I come quickly &amp; my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shal be. He that testifieth <a id="l1854"></a>these things saith surely I come quickly. The Devil is come down unto you having <a id="l1855"></a>great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.  ffive are fallen &amp; one is &amp; the other is not yet come &amp; when he cometh <a id="l1857"></a>he must continue a short space. It was said unto the martyrs under the <a id="l1858"></a>Altar that they should rest yet for a little season, untill  their brethren <a id="l1859"></a>which should be killed as they were should be fulfilled. The Revelation of Iesus <a id="l1860"></a>Christ which God gave unto him  to shew unto his servants things which must <a id="l1861"></a>shortly come to pass. Repent or else I will come unto thee quickly &amp; remove thy <a id="l1862"></a>Candlestick out of its place. Repent or else I will come unto thee quickly &amp; fight against <a id="l1863"></a>them with the sword of my mouth. I gave that woman Iezabel space to repent of their fornica<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 42r &gt; </span>tion &amp; she repented not. All these  sayings are of a kind &amp; signify long <a id="l1864"></a>times in the language of the vulgar tho represented short ones in the language <a id="l1865"></a>of the Prophesy: Which same Interpreters not understanding have run <a id="l1866"></a>into many errors. Christ endeavoured to put his disciples perpetually upon the <a id="l1867"></a>    <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>expectation<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of his second coming that they might be constantly upon the watch. <a id="l1871"></a><em class="underline">Watch therefore</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come</em>. <a id="l1872"></a>Mat. 24.42, &amp; 25.13. Marc. 13.35 <em class="underline">If therefore thou shalt not watch I will come <a id="l1873"></a>on thee as a thief &amp; thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee</em> <a id="l1874"></a>Apoc. 3.3. And for this reason he tells them plainly that <em class="underline">it was not for them to <a id="l1875"></a>know the times &amp; seasons which the father hath put in his own power</em> Act. 1 &amp; always <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p042v"> &lt;42v&gt; </span> exprest himself  so about his second coming that <a id="l1876"></a>they might not think it far off. If a man keep my sayings he shall never <a id="l1877"></a>tast of death Iohn 8.51, 52. He that beleiveth in me shal never dye <a id="l1878"></a>Iohn 11.26. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness &amp; are dead: this <a id="l1879"></a>is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof <a id="l1880"></a>&amp; not dye. Iohn 6.50. What if I will that he tarry till I come? Iohn 21. There <a id="l1881"></a>be some standing here which shal not tast of death till they see the <a id="l1882"></a>son of man coming in his kingdom Mat. 16.28. All these sayings are of a <a id="l1883"></a>kind &amp; respect the second death but seem designed to make the unwary <a id="l1884"></a>disciples expect an end of the world before some then alive should <a id="l1885"></a>dy naturally. ffor which reason he tells them also Ye shall not have <a id="l1886"></a>gone over the Cities of Israel till the son of man be come &amp; this genera<a id="l1887"></a>tion shall not pass away before all these things be fulfilled, &amp; in the <a id="l1888"></a>Apocalyps  describes all the times short which precede his second coming,  putting every <a id="l1891"></a>where days for years &amp; a short space or little season for many ages. 
All which ways <a id="l1892"></a>of speaking did not only put the first Christians upon an expectati<a id="l1893"></a>on of Christs coming  in their age but also has entrapt some <a id="l1894"></a>later Interpreters of scripture &amp; put 'em upon applying these prophesies <a id="l1895"></a>to the  siege of Ierusalem by the Romans. Whereas I dare confidently affirm that <a id="l1896"></a>there is not one  prophesy or text in scripture concerning the coming of Christ <a id="l1897"></a>but what is meant of one of his two personal comings. When he saith, <a id="l1898"></a><em class="underline">there be some standing here which shal not tast of death till they see <a id="l1899"></a>the son of man coming in his kingdom:</em> he speaks of eternal death, as is <a id="l1900"></a>manifest both by  the analogy of this text with others mentioned <a id="l1901"></a>above &amp; by the context:  for in the words immediately before he <a id="l1902"></a>was speaking of life &amp; death eternal &amp; of his coming in glory with his <a id="l1903"></a>Angels to reward every man according to his works. When he saith <em class="underline">this <a id="l1904"></a>generation shal not pass away</em>  &amp;c he means the progeny or nation <a id="l1905"></a>of the Iews, or more stricktly, this <em class="underline">wicked &amp; adulterous generation</em>, this <a id="l1906"></a> <em class="underline">faithless &amp; pervers generation</em>, this <em class="underline">generation of vipers</em>, this <a id="l1907"></a><em class="underline">generation</em> by which the son of man shal be rejected, as the Iews are <a id="l1908"></a>termed in other places. When all these things shal be fulfilled then <a id="l1909"></a>shall this generation pass away by the final &amp; total conversion of Isra<a id="l1910"></a>el, &amp; not before. And when he saith <em class="underline">Ye shal not have finished <a id="l1911"></a>the cities of Israel till the Son of man be come</em>: if this be applied to <a id="l1912"></a>the siege of Ierusalem I answer that if the disciples had not finished <a id="l1913"></a>those cities before this siege, they have not yet finished them. ffinishing <a id="l1914"></a>is here put for a total conversion of Israel which is not yet come to pass <a id="l1915"></a>You may know the sense of the place by the context. ffor in the <a id="l1916"></a>context before,  Christ had said: <em class="underline">He that endureth to the end shal <a id="l1917"></a>be saved</em> &amp; in that after he adds, there is nothing covered that shall <a id="l1918"></a>not be revealed &amp; hid that shal not be known, &amp; therefore was <a id="l1919"></a>speaking of his coming to the last judgment. So then these three <a id="l1920"></a>passages do not enforce the application of the second coming of Christ <a id="l1921"></a>to the siege of Ierusalem &amp; if these do not  I know <a id="l1922"></a>no other that can, &amp; without necessity the significations of the prophe<a id="l1923"></a>tic phrases are not to be multiplied.</p>

<p id="par110">Nakedness being shamefull &amp; ignominious is put for <a id="l1977"></a>shame confusion &amp; reproach &amp; splendid cloathing for <a id="l1978"></a>reputation, honour,  glory &amp; power &amp; sometimes for those things <a id="l1979"></a>wherein glory  is founded, as for righteousness &amp; good works if the <a id="l1980"></a>garments be white, or for royal dignity if they be <a id="l1981"></a> scarlet or purple.  <em class="underline">The interpretation of <a id="l1982"></a>garments,</em> say the Persians &amp; Ægyptians, <em class="underline">belongs to honour <a id="l1983"></a>&amp; glory – And if a King cloath any of his nobles with <a id="l1984"></a>his own garments &amp; the garment be purple he shall <a id="l1985"></a>confer upon him more glory &amp; power &amp; trust him <a id="l1986"></a>with his secrets: but if the garment be of another <a id="l1987"></a>kind he shall grant him less honour according as <a id="l1988"></a>the garment is – And if a King seem to have a new tincture of purple made, he shall triumph over his enemies – And if any one seem to have lost <a id="l1989"></a>his garments, this imports misery accordingly as the <a id="l1990"></a>garments were pretious</em>.

To the same purpose see also Isa. 59.6, 17 &amp; 61.3, 10 &amp; Psal. 73.6 &amp; 109.18, 19, 29 &amp; Iob. 29.14 </p>
<p id="par111">The golden cup in the hand of the Whore of Babylon <a id="l2010"></a>is said to be full of abominations &amp; filthiness of her forni<a id="l2011"></a>cation &amp; this filthinesse is a little before called the wine <a id="l2012"></a>of the fury of her fornication wherewith she inebriates the inhabitants of the <a id="l2013"></a>earth &amp; so is a Philtre or love-cup. Now as water of life <a id="l2014"></a> given to thirsty men  &amp; wine given to drink in <a id="l2015"></a>the Eucharist signifies the doctrine of truth by which men are <a id="l2016"></a>nourished to life eternal: so the wine of fornication in this <a id="l2017"></a>Cup must signify the doctrine of idolatry (or as the Apostle Paul <a id="l2018"></a>calls it, the doctrine of Dæmons &amp; lying miracles) by which as with an enchanted <a id="l2019"></a>Philtre she entices her lovers to commit spiritual fornication <a id="l2020"></a>with her, &amp; makes them erre &amp; reel to &amp; fro like drunken men &amp; become furious in their inordinate affections &amp; passions <a id="l2021"></a>towards their spiritual mistresse.

So then to <a id="l2039"></a>deceive men by fals doctrine is to make them drunk in the language <a id="l2040"></a>of the Prophets, &amp;  by consequence the wine of fornication <a id="l2041"></a>is seduction to idolatry. So also to deceive by fals counsels  in civil affairs is to make drunk  . <em class="underline">The Princes of Noph are deceived they have <a id="l2043"></a>also seduced Egypt – the Lord hath mingled a  spirit <a id="l2044"></a>of error in the midst thereof, &amp; they have caused Egypt to <a id="l2045"></a>erre in every work thereof as a drunken man staggereth in <a id="l2046"></a>his vomit</em>. Isa. 19.13, 14.

<p id="par112">28 A <em class="underline">wound</em> or <em class="underline">sore</em> if not of a single person but of a people or <a id="l2063"></a>kingdom signifies a stroke or plague by war famine or pestilence, <a id="l2064"></a>but chiefly by war. ffor smiting a people or nation is the ordinary <a id="l2065"></a>scripture phrase for smiting them with the sword: &amp; the proper effect of smiting <a id="l2066"></a>is a wound: which if it be not bound up &amp; soon healed grows putred, <a id="l2067"></a>ulcerate, very painful &amp; sometimes incurable. To bind up &amp; heal is to <a id="l2068"></a>restore a kingdom. Whence if after smiting it be not soon restored <a id="l2069"></a>&amp; healed, its desolation will be fitly represented a putred &amp; painfull <a id="l2070"></a>sore. So then by a wound if described great but not of a putred <a id="l2071"></a>or ulcerate kind we are to understand only a violent &amp; sudden smiting <a id="l2072"></a>by a prevailing enemy: but if not bound up, if ulcerate, noisome <a id="l2073"></a>or painfull, a durable &amp; tedious as well as vexatious desolation; &amp; if <a id="l2074"></a>we shall find these phrases used by the Prophets, <em class="underline">Despise not the chastisement <a id="l2075"></a>of the  Almighty, for he maketh sore &amp; bindeth up, he woundeth <a id="l2076"></a>&amp; his hands make whole. He shall deliver thee in six troubles yea in <a id="l2077"></a>seven shall no evil touch thee. In famine he shall redeem thee <a id="l2078"></a>from death &amp; in war from the power of the sword.</em> Iob. 5.18, 20. <a id="l2079"></a>Again in 2 Cron 6 28, 29 Solomon in dedicating the Temple prays thus for <a id="l2080"></a>Israel. <em class="underline">If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there <a id="l2081"></a>be blasting or mildew, Locusts or Caterpillers; if their enemies besiege <a id="l2082"></a>them in the cities of their land: whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there <a id="l2083"></a>be, then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p044r"> &lt;44r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his  own sore &amp; his <a id="l2084"></a>own grief, &amp; shal spread forth his hands in this house. Then hear thou <a id="l2085"></a>from heaven</em> &amp;c. In the Lamentations ch 3.12, the Prophet Ieremy introduces <a id="l2086"></a>Ierusalem thus bewailing her captivity in Babylon: He (God) <em class="underline">hath made me <a id="l2087"></a>desolate, he hath bent his bow &amp; set me as a mark for the arrow, he <a id="l2088"></a>hath caused the arrow of his quiver to enter into my loins</em>. So in Ier <a id="l2089"></a>10.18, 19. Thus saith the Lord, <em class="underline">behold I will fling out the inhabitants of <a id="l2090"></a>the Land at this once &amp; I will distress them that they may find it so. Wo is <a id="l2091"></a>me for my hurt, my wound is grievous, but I said truly this is a <a id="l2092"></a>grief &amp; I must bear it. My tabernacle is spoiled</em> &amp;c. Thus also Isaiah <a id="l2093"></a>Chap. 1.5, 6, 7. describes the desolation of Iudah, <em class="underline">They have provoked the holy one of Israel into anger, they are gone away backward. Why should ye be stricken any more? Ye will revolt more &amp; more. The whole head <a id="l2094"></a>is sick &amp; the whole heart faint, ffrom the sole of the foot even to the head <a id="l2095"></a>there is no soundness in it, but wounds &amp; bruises &amp; putrefying sores: <a id="l2096"></a>They have not been closed neither bound up neither mollified with ointment</em>. <a id="l2097"></a>And then describing what was thus stricken for their revoltings, what <a id="l2098"></a>that sickness of the head &amp; heart, those grievous wounds bruises &amp; sores <a id="l2099"></a>from the foot to head made by that striking which had not been bound up <a id="l2100"></a>nor anointed, he adds in the next words <em class="underline">Your country is desolate, your <a id="l2101"></a>cities burnt with fire, your land strangers devour in your presence &amp; it <a id="l2102"></a>is desolate as overthrown by strangers.</em> In like manner Moses in Deut. <a id="l2103"></a>28.35 prophetically proscribes the long captivity &amp; dispersion of the Iews into <a id="l2104"></a>all nations by a botch that cannot be healed from the sole of the foot to the <a id="l2105"></a>top of the head. So again in Ier. 30.11 &amp;c. <em class="underline">Though I make a full end <a id="l2106"></a>of all nations whether I have scattered thee, yet will I not make <a id="l2107"></a>a full end of thee but I will correct thee in measure &amp; will not leave <a id="l2108"></a>thee altogether unpunished. ffor thus saith the Lord thy bruise is incur <a id="l2109"></a><br>able &amp; thy wound is grievous. There is none to plead thy cause that <a id="l2110"></a>thou mayst be bound up. Thou hast no healing medicines. All thy lovers <a id="l2111"></a>have forsaken thee. They seek thee not. ffor I have wounded thee <a id="l2112"></a>with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement of a cruel one for the <a id="l2113"></a>multitude of thy iniquity because thy sins were increased. Why criest <a id="l2114"></a>for thine affliction? Thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine <a id="l2115"></a>iniquity. Because thy sins were increased I have done these things <a id="l2116"></a>unto thee. Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured, &amp; all</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p045r"> &lt;45r&gt; </span> 
<em class="underline">thine adversaries every one of them shall go into captivity &amp; they that spoil <a id="l2117"></a>thee shall be a spoil &amp; all that pray upon thee will I give for a pray. ffor <a id="l2118"></a>I will restore health unto &amp; heal thee of thy wounds saith the Lord <a id="l2119"></a>becasue they called thee an outcast, saying This is Zion whom no man <a id="l2120"></a>seeketh after. Thus saith the Lord, behold I will bring again the captivity <a id="l2121"></a>of Iacob's tents</em> &amp;c. Thus also in Isa. 30.26, <em class="underline">His return from captivity <a id="l2122"></a>is called the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people &amp; healeth <a id="l2123"></a>the stroke of their wound</em>. ffor which expressions the Targam Ionathan hath <a id="l2124"></a><em class="underline">In die qua reducet Deus captivitatem populi sui &amp; infirmitatem plagæ <a id="l2125"></a>ejus sanabit</em>. And to the same purpose it is that the Prophet Nahum chap. 3 <a id="l2126"></a>19, describing the siege &amp; final desolation of Neneveh by the sword concludes <a id="l2127"></a>in these words <em class="underline">There is no healing of thy bruise: thy wound is grievous: <a id="l2128"></a>All that hear the bruit of thee shal clap their hands over thee</em>. Thus <a id="l2129"></a>full is the consent of the prophets in their use of this phrase. So in the <a id="l2130"></a>Apocalyps ch. 16 in the fift vial at whose pouring out the kingdom of the Beast <a id="l2131"></a>became full of darkness that is obscured by a cloud of invading enemies <a id="l2132"></a>its said that they of this kingdom <em class="underline">blasphemed God because of their pains <a id="l2133"></a>&amp; of their sores</em>. And so in the first vial the <em class="underline">grievous &amp; noisome sore which <a id="l2134"></a>fell on the worshippers of the Beast</em> (if we will keep to the use of the <a id="l2135"></a>phrase) must signify a grievous &amp; tedious plague of war falling on that <a id="l2136"></a>Kingdom. But the <em class="underline">wound of the Beast with a sword</em> being not described a <a id="l2137"></a>putred ulcerate noisome or painful sore, but a wound healed again, as <a id="l2138"></a>if it were heaed whilst a green wound, will properly signify only <a id="l2139"></a>a sudden &amp; remarkable smiting that kingdom &amp; conquering it (for the <a id="l2140"></a>wound was deadly) &amp; the restitution of it soon after to its former state, <a id="l2141"></a>without any vexatious &amp; tedious harassing &amp; wasting the conquered sub<a id="l2142"></a>jects in the middle time.</p>
<p id="par113">Pain of a nation signifies the same thing with a sore as you may <a id="l2143"></a>see in the passages quoted in the last Paragraph, &amp; in these: <em class="underline">Why is <a id="l2144"></a>my pain perpetual, &amp; my pain incurable which refuseth to be <a id="l2145"></a>healed</em>? Ier. 15.18. which words are of Iersusalem lamenting her long <a id="l2146"></a>captivity &amp; dispersion. Again, <em class="underline">Babylon is suddenly fallen &amp; destroyed, <a id="l2147"></a>Howl for her take Balm for her pain, if so be she may healed. <a id="l2148"></a>We would have healed Babylon but she is not healed</em>. Ier. 51.8. <a id="l2149"></a>There shall be no more a Prince in the land of Egypt – I will make <a id="l2150"></a>Pathros desolate – I will pour out my fury upon Sin the strength of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p046r"> &lt;46r&gt; </span> Ægypt, &amp; I will cut of the multitude in No. And I will set a fire <a id="l2151"></a>in Ægypt. Sin shall have great pain, &amp; No shall be rent asunder <a id="l2152"></a>&amp; Noph shall have distresses dayly. The young Men of Aven &amp; of <a id="l2153"></a>Phibeseth shall fall by the sword. Ezek 30.16. So in the Apocalyps <a id="l2154"></a>c. 16.10. <em class="underline">They gnawed their tongues for pain &amp; blasphemed the <a id="l2155"></a>God of heaven because of their pains &amp; their sores.</em> And Apoc. <a id="l2156"></a>21.4. <em class="underline">Neither shall there be any more pain</em>, that is no more war <a id="l2157"></a>upon the saints, no more persecution. To which purpose also the <a id="l2158"></a>expressions there that there shall be no more <em class="underline">sorrow nor crying</em> <a id="l2159"></a>&amp; Apoc. 7.17. <em class="underline">God shal wipe away all tears from their eyes</em>: like <a id="l2160"></a>that of Isaiah Chap. 25.8. <em class="underline">He shall swallow up death in victory <a id="l2161"></a>&amp; the Lord God will wipe away tears of all faces &amp; the rebuke <a id="l2162"></a>of his people will he take from of all the earth</em>. To which place <a id="l2163"></a>the two former in Apoc. 7 &amp; 21 seem to referr.</p>
<p id="par114">And becasue pain &amp; dolour is used to signfy the labouring of <a id="l2164"></a>a nation under an enemy, &amp; God used to deliver up his people <a id="l2165"></a>into the hands of their enemies for Idolatry, hence it is that <a id="l2166"></a>among the Hebrews the words עצבים, &amp;  צירים <a id="l2167"></a>dolores &amp; תפלצת horror , were used as or<a id="l2168"></a>dinary names for Idols, as you may see in  Hos. 4.17. Psal. <a id="l2169"></a>106.36. Isa. 45.16. 1 Kings 15.13. &amp; other places.</p>
<p id="par115">But to express the pain &amp; misery of hostile desolations the neater, <a id="l2170"></a>it is ofter represented by the pains of a woman in travail. And <a id="l2171"></a>sometimes this pain is put to express the terror &amp; consternation <a id="l2172"></a>at the evil approaching. Behold a people cometh from the north <a id="l2173"></a>country – we have heard the fame thereof, our hands wax feeble <a id="l2174"></a>anguish hath taken hold of us &amp; pain as of a woman in travail. <a id="l2175"></a>Go not forth into the field nor walk by the way for the sword of the <a id="l2176"></a>enemy &amp; fear is on every side. Ier. 6.22, 24, 25. To the same <a id="l2177"></a>purpose see Isa. 13.8. Ier. 48.41 &amp; 49 22 &amp; 50.43. But here <a id="l2178"></a>we are to conceive the dread of the evil approaching to beare <a id="l2179"></a>analogy with the fear &amp; fainting of a woman at her pains approach<a id="l2180"></a>ing, &amp; the evil it self with the real pain. And because the Church of God <a id="l2181"></a>is frequently compared to a woman, therefore is this figure used <a id="l2182"></a> to express the affliction of the Church under her enemies. <a id="l2183"></a>Thus our Saviour in Matt. 24.8, 9 &amp; Mark 13.9 describing the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p047r"> &lt;47r&gt; </span> future persecutions of the Church calls them ἱοδινας. So Isa. ch. 66.<a id="l2184"></a>7; speaking of the Iewish Church, saith, <em class="underline">Before she travailed, <a id="l2185"></a>she brought forth, before her pain came she was delivered of a <a id="l2186"></a>Manchild</em>: which the Chalde Paraphrast thus interprets: <em class="underline">Antequam <a id="l2187"></a>veniat ei tribulatio redempta erit, antequam veniat ei tremor, <a id="l2188"></a>sicut dolores parturientes, revelabitur Rex ejus</em> Ieremiah also <a id="l2189"></a>in Ch. 30.6, 7 interprets this figure plainly: <em class="underline">We have heard a <a id="l2190"></a>voice of trembling of fear &amp; not of peace. Ask ye now, saith <a id="l2191"></a>he, &amp; see whether a man doth travail with child. Wherefore do I <a id="l2192"></a>see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail; <a id="l2193"></a>&amp; all faces are turned into paleness? Alas for that day is great <a id="l2194"></a>so that none is like it. It is even the time of Iacobs trouble, but <a id="l2195"></a>he shall be saved out of it. – And strangers shall no more serve <a id="l2196"></a>themselves of him</em>. So in Micah ch. 4.10. <em class="underline">Why dost thou cry out <a id="l2197"></a>aloud? Is there no King in thee? Is thy Counsellour perished? <a id="l2198"></a>ffor pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail. Be in pain <a id="l2199"></a>&amp; labour to bring forth o daughter of Zion like a woman in tra<a id="l2200"></a>vail: for now thou shalt go forth out of the city &amp; thou shalt dwell <a id="l2201"></a>in the field, &amp; thou shall go even to Babylon. There shalt thou be <a id="l2202"></a>delivered. There the Lord shal redeem thee out of the hand of thine <a id="l2203"></a>enemies.</em> To the same purpose see Isa. 26.17 &amp; Ier. 22.23. And <a id="l2204"></a>so in the Apocalyps the Church being represented by a woman, whose <a id="l2205"></a>seed kept the commandments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus <a id="l2206"></a>to signify her being under a great persecution she is described <a id="l2207"></a>crying &amp; in pain to be delivered. ffor that this pain &amp; crying signifies <a id="l2208"></a>a persecution, &amp; that a very violent one, is further exprest by her <a id="l2209"></a>being cloathed with the Sun the most hot &amp; fiery of all things, &amp; by <a id="l2210"></a>the Dragon's standing before her &amp; drawing the third part of the <a id="l2211"></a>stars of heaven with his tail &amp; casting them to the earth: that is by <a id="l2212"></a>her being agitated with vehement war, for so fire always signifies; <a id="l2213"></a>&amp; by the Dragon's being her adversary, &amp; with his army dragging and <a id="l2214"></a>casting down the saints of heaven, whence upon the ensuing victory <a id="l2215"></a>over the Dragon 'tis added that <em class="underline">they overcame him by the blood of the <a id="l2216"></a>Lamb, &amp; by the word of their testimony, &amp; loved not their lives <a id="l2217"></a>unto the death</em>.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p048r"> &lt;48r&gt; </span>
<p id="par116">And as pain in travail signifies labouring under a persecuting <a id="l2218"></a>enemy, so delivery signifies redemption from the hand of the <a id="l2219"></a>enemy, the pains then ceasing, &amp; the new born child signifies the <a id="l2220"></a>new kingdom brought forth upon her delivery: as you may see <a id="l2221"></a>in the places last cited: <em class="underline">Labour to bring forth o daughter of <a id="l2222"></a>Zion, like a woman in travail – Thou shalt go even to Babylon <a id="l2223"></a>There shalt thou be delivered: there the Lord shall redeem thee <a id="l2224"></a>from the hand of thine enemies</em>. Ier. 22.23. Here after the <a id="l2225"></a>pangs of desolation &amp; captivity, her delivery at Babylon is ex<a id="l2226"></a>pressly called redemption from the hand of the enemy, &amp; what was <a id="l2227"></a>that but the redemption wrought by Cyrus conquering the proud <a id="l2228"></a>enemy, &amp; setting the miserable Iews at liberty? And what was <a id="l2229"></a>the Infant the daughter of Zion brought forth but the new born <a id="l2230"></a>body politique of the Iews led back from Babylon under Zerub<a id="l2231"></a>babel? So again in Isa. 26.17 speaking of the long captivity &amp; <a id="l2232"></a>final redemption of Israel: <em class="underline">Thou hast removed</em> [the nation] <a id="l2233"></a><em class="underline">far unto all the ends of the earth. Lord in trouble have they <a id="l2234"></a>visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastning was <a id="l2235"></a>upon them. Like as a woman with child that draweth near the <a id="l2236"></a>time of her delivery, is in pain &amp; cryeth out in her pangs, <a id="l2237"></a>so have we been in thy sight, O Lord, we have been with child, we <a id="l2238"></a>have  been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind <a id="l2239"></a>we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth, neither have <a id="l2240"></a>the inhabitants of the world fallen. Thy dead men shal live – <a id="l2241"></a>Come my people – hide thy self as it were for a little moment <a id="l2242"></a>till the indignation be overpast. ffor behold the Lord cometh <a id="l2243"></a>out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth</em> &amp;c. All <a id="l2244"></a>which with what follows in the next chapter is as much as to say, <a id="l2245"></a>that the dispersed Iews were with child of a new polity &amp; laboured <a id="l2246"></a>as a woman in travail by the fall of their enemies to work <a id="l2247"></a>themselves deliverance &amp; bring it forth, but brought forth <a id="l2248"></a>nothing: but at length when the indignation was over God should <a id="l2249"></a>overthrow their enemies &amp; restore Israel. But in Isa. 66.7 <a id="l2250"></a>the Prophet is much more plain. <em class="underline">Your brethren that hated you, <a id="l2251"></a>that cast you out for my names sake</em> [i.e. the Gentiles which dispersed &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p049r"> &lt;49r&gt; </span> long hated you &amp; were converted to Christianity] said, <em class="underline">Let the <a id="l2252"></a>Lord be glorified; but he shall appear to your joy &amp; they <a id="l2253"></a>shal be ashamed. A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the <a id="l2254"></a>Temple, a voice of the Lord that rendereth recompence to his <a id="l2255"></a>enemies. Before she travailed, she brought forth, before <a id="l2256"></a>her pain came she was delivered of a Manchild. Who hath <a id="l2257"></a>heard such things? Who hath seen such things? Shall the earth <a id="l2258"></a>be made to bring forth in one day, or shal a <span class="large">Nation</span> be born <a id="l2259"></a>at once? ffor as soon as Zion travaileth she brought forth <a id="l2260"></a>her children. Shall I bring to the birth &amp; not cause to be brought <a id="l2261"></a>forth? saith the Lord: shall I cause to bring forth &amp; shut the <a id="l2262"></a>womb? saith the Lord thy God. Rejoyce ye with Ierusalem &amp; <a id="l2263"></a>be glad with her all ye that love her: rejoyce for joy with her all <a id="l2264"></a>ye that mourn for her, that ye may suck &amp; be satisfied with the brests of <a id="l2265"></a>her consolations: that ye may milk out &amp; be delighted with the abun<a id="l2266"></a>dance of her glory. ffor thus saith the Lord, I will extend peace <a id="l2267"></a>to her like a river, &amp; the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: <a id="l2268"></a>then shall ye suck</em> &amp;c. Here the woman is Zion as the Church first <a id="l2269"></a>labouring under affliction, then rejoycing after deliverance, &amp; <a id="l2270"></a>her <span class="large">Man-child</span> is the nation brought forth by her deliverance <a id="l2271"></a>those who first mourned for her &amp; then rejoyced with her all the <a id="l2272"></a>sons of the Church first in affliction &amp; then in prosperity. The <a id="l2273"></a>woman &amp; her child are one &amp; the same people represented by a <a id="l2274"></a>Woman as they are the Church of God, &amp; by a Man-child as they <a id="l2275"></a>are a Nation or kingdom new born by victory over their enemies, <a id="l2276"></a>&amp; differ only in their Rulers &amp; authority, the one having spiritual <a id="l2277"></a>rulers in things spiritual, the other civil Rulers in things civil. <a id="l2278"></a>And in like manner in the Apocalyps by the Man-child of which the <a id="l2279"></a>woman in travail was delivered is to be understood not a single <a id="l2280"></a>person but a Kingdom brought forth by the Church at her delivery <a id="l2281"></a>from persecution &amp; consisting of the same persons with the woman, but <a id="l2282"></a>under different Governours &amp; a different government. A woman <a id="l2283"></a>&amp; her child are things of the same kind &amp; therefore as the one here re<a id="l2284"></a>presents a multitude so should the other: this a body politique &amp; chiefly <a id="l2285"></a>the rulers thereof most properly signified by a Male, as that a body <a id="l2286"></a>ecclesiastick usually signified by a female.</p>

<span class="pagenumber" id="p050r"> &lt;50r&gt; </span>

<p id="par118">Death  of bodies politique is their dissolution.   So where <a id="l2316"></a>the army of Locusts torment men without killing them, the meaning is  not that they kill none of their people but only that they <a id="l2318"></a>make war upon them without dissolving their kingdom Apoc. 9. And  where <a id="l2319"></a>all living creatures in the Sea died Apoc 16.3 &amp; all  were <a id="l2320"></a>killed that would not worship the Image of the Beast chap. 13.15 <a id="l2321"></a> &amp; the Beast was mortally wounded by a sword &amp; revived, the death is plainly by a dissolution of their bodies politique or ecclesiastique. And in <a id="l2322"></a>the same sense the two witnesses, the third part of men, the third part of the creatures in the Sea, the martyr <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p051r"> &lt;51r&gt; </span> Antipas,  <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> the fourth Beast in Daniel  &amp; the Dragon in Isaias<sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> <a id="l2323"></a>are slain. </p>
