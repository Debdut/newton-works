<p id="par1" class="i0">this was the second kingdom which fell before the little horn.</p>
<p id="par2"><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>In the year 796 Leo III being made Pope, notified <a id="l1"></a>his election to Charles the great by his Legates, sending <a id="l2"></a>him for a present the golden keys of the Confession of S<sup>t</sup> <a id="l3"></a>Peter &amp; the banner of the city of Rome: the first as <a id="l4"></a>an acknowledgment of the Popes holding the cities of the <a id="l5"></a>Exarchate &amp; Lombardy by the grant of Charles, the other <a id="l6"></a>as a signification that Charles should come &amp; subdue the <a id="l7"></a>Council &amp; people of Rome as he had done the Exar<a id="l8"></a>chate &amp; the kingdome of the Lombards.  For the <a id="l9"></a>Pope at the same time desired Charles to send some of <a id="l10"></a>his Princes to Rome who might subject the Roman <a id="l11"></a>people to him &amp; bind them  by oath <em class="underline">in fide <a id="l12"></a>&amp; subjectione</em> in fealty &amp; subjection, as his words are recited <a id="l13"></a>by Sigonius.  An anonymous poet published by Boeclerus at <a id="l14"></a>Strasburg  expresses it thus:</p>
<div class="lg">
<p class="l">Admonuitque pijs præcibus, qui mittere vellet</p>
<p class="l">Ex proprijs aliquos primoribus ac sibi  plebem</p>
<p class="l">Subdere Romanam, servandaque fœdera cogens</p>
<p class="l">Hanc fidei sacramentis promittere magnis.</p>
</div>
<p id="par3" class="i0"> Hence arose a misunderstanding between the Pope &amp; the City <a id="l15"></a>And about two or three years after, the Romans by the assistance <a id="l16"></a>of some of the Clergy, raised so great tumults against him as <a id="l17"></a>gave occasion to a new state of things in all the west.  ffor <a id="l18"></a>two of the Clergy accused him of certain crimes &amp; by an armed <a id="l19"></a>force of the Romans seized him stript him of his sacerdotal habit <a id="l20"></a>&amp; imprisoned him in a monastery.  But by assistance of his friends <a id="l21"></a>he made his escape &amp; fled into Germany to Charles the great, &amp; <a id="l22"></a>complained of the Romans  for acting against <a id="l23"></a>him out of a designe of throwing of all authority of the Church <a id="l24"></a>&amp; recovering their ancient freedom.  And in his absence  his accusers with an armed force ravaged the possessions <a id="l26"></a>of the Church, &amp; sent the accusations to Charles.  And before the <a id="l27"></a>end of the year Charles sent the Pope back to Rome with a <a id="l28"></a>large retinue.  And the Nobles &amp; bishops of France who accom<a id="l29"></a>panied him, examined the Chief of the accusers at Rome &amp; <a id="l30"></a>sent them into France in custody.  This was in the year 799, &amp; <a id="l31"></a>the next year Charles himself went to Rome &amp; upon a day <a id="l32"></a>appointed presided in a Council of  Italian &amp; ffrench Bishops <a id="l33"></a>to hear both parties.  But when the Pope's adversaries ex<a id="l34"></a>pected to be heard, <sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup>the Council declared that he who was <a id="l35"></a>the supreme judge of all men was above being judged by any <a id="l36"></a>other then himself.  And thereupon the Pope made a solemn <a id="l37"></a>declaration of his innocence before all the people, &amp; by doing <a id="l38"></a>so was looked upon as acquitted.</p>
<p id="par4">A few days after when Christmas day arrived, the people <a id="l39"></a>of Rome who had hitherto elected their Bishop &amp; recconed <a id="l40"></a>that they &amp; their Senate inherited the rights of the ancient Senate &amp; people of Rome <a id="l41"></a>, voted Charles their Emperor, &amp; subjected <a id="l42"></a>themselves to him in such a manner as the old Roman Empire  <a id="l43"></a>&amp; their senate were subject to the old Roman Emperors.  And the <a id="l44"></a>Pope crowned him &amp; annointed him with holy oyle &amp; worshipped <a id="l45"></a>him on his knees after the manner of adoring the old Roman Empe<a id="l46"></a>rors, as the aforesaid Poet thus mentions.</p>
<div class="lg">
<p class="l">Post laudes igitur victus &amp; summus eundem</p>
<p class="l">Præsul adoravit, sicut mos debitus olim</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span>
<p class="l">Principibus fuit antiquis.</p>
</div>
<p id="par5" class="i0">And the Emperor mutually took the following oath to the Pope.  <a id="l47"></a><em class="underline">In nomine Christi spondeo atque polliceor Ego Carolus Imperator <a id="l48"></a>coram Deo &amp; beato Petro Apostolo me protectorem ac defensorem <a id="l49"></a>fore hujus sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ in omnibus utilitatibus <a id="l50"></a>quatenus divino fultus fuero adjutorio prout sciero po<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>t<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>eroque</em>. <a id="l51"></a> The Emperor was <a id="l52"></a>also made Consul of Rome &amp; his son Pipin was crowned king of  Italy.  And henceforward the Emperor stiled himself Carolus <a id="l54"></a>serenissimus Augustus a Deo coronatus, magnus, pacificus, <a id="l55"></a>Romæ gubernans Imperium, or Imperator Romanorum, &amp; was prayed for in the Churches <a id="l56"></a>of Rome.  And <a id="l57"></a>the enemies of the Pope to the number of 300 noble Romans <a id="l58"></a>&amp; two or three of the Clergy were sentenced to death:  &amp; <a id="l59"></a>the 300 Romans were beheaded in one day in the Lateran field, <a id="l60"></a>but the Clergy  at the intercession of the <a id="l61"></a>Pope were pardoned &amp; banished into France.  And thus the <a id="l62"></a>right of the Roman Emperors which had hitherto been in the <a id="l63"></a>Greek Emperors was by this act translated to the kings of <a id="l64"></a>France.</p>
<p id="par6"><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup>After these things Charles gave the City &amp; Dutchy of Rome to the Pope subordinately to himself as Emperor of the Romans  &amp; spent the Winter in ordering the <a id="l65"></a> affairs of Rome &amp; of the Apostolick See &amp; all <a id="l66"></a>Italy both civil &amp;  ecclesiastical, &amp; in making new <a id="l67"></a>laws for them, &amp; leaving the City under  its Senate &amp; both under the Pope returned the next summer into France.  <a id="l68"></a>And hearing that his new laws were not observed by the Iudges <a id="l69"></a> in dictating the law nor by the people in hearing <a id="l70"></a>it, &amp; that the great men took servants from free men &amp; <a id="l71"></a>from the Churches &amp; Monasteries to labour in their vinyards <a id="l72"></a> fields  pastures &amp; houses, &amp; continued to exact cattel &amp; wine <a id="l73"></a>of them &amp; to oppress those that served the Churches: he wrote <a id="l74"></a>to his son Pipin to remedy these abuses take care of the <a id="l75"></a>Church &amp; see that his laws be executed.  It is observable <a id="l76"></a>also that the custome of kissing the Popes feet began about <a id="l77"></a>this time.  There are some instances of it in the  ninth <a id="l78"></a>century.  Platina tells us that  the feet of Pope Leo IIII <a id="l79"></a>were kissed according to ancient custome by all that came to him <a id="l80"></a>&amp; some say that Leo III began this custome pretending that his <a id="l81"></a>hand was infected by the kiss of a woman.</p>
<p id="par7">Now the Senate &amp; people of Rome I take to be the third <a id="l82"></a>king which was overcome by the little horn.  For the old Roman <a id="l83"></a>Empire was a king in the sense of Daniels prophesies, as well <a id="l84"></a>when it was in the form of a common wealth under its <a id="l85"></a>senate as when it was reduced to a monarchical form of <a id="l86"></a>government under its Emperors.  This people elected the Pope <a id="l87"></a>&amp; the Emperor &amp; by electing the Emperor was acknowledged to be <a id="l88"></a>the remainder of the old Roman Empire &amp; by consequence a little Em<a id="l89"></a>pire, the Empire of the Romans in whose name the fourth Beast of Daniel still con<a id="l90"></a>tinued &amp;  of which Charles was made Emperor.   Rome was to be  the metropolis of the little horn &amp; therefore its Dutchy was to <a id="l92"></a>be conquered by him.  And the victory of the little horn over this king <a id="l93"></a>was attended with greater consequences then those over the other two <a id="l94"></a>kings &amp; finished the work which those victories began. ffor it set up the <a id="l95"></a>western empire which continues to this day.  It completed &amp; secured Peter's patrimony to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> the Pope: which patrimony was the kingdom of the little horn: &amp; it <a id="l96"></a>set up the Pope above all humane judicature &amp; gave him the supremacy &amp; a look <a id="l97"></a>more stout then his fellows.  When the Pope in favour of the <a id="l98"></a>worship of images revolted from the Greek Emperor &amp; began <a id="l99"></a>to set up for himself; in rising up he overcame these three Kings <a id="l100"></a>who stood in his way &amp; opposed him &amp; by overcoming them he rose <a id="l101"></a>up &amp; acquired a temporal kingdom  composed of the three conquests &amp; thereby became a horn <a id="l102"></a>of the Beast.  And in token that he is a king as well as a <a id="l103"></a>bishop he wears the crowns of three kingdoms upon his head <a id="l104"></a>in form of a triple crown, &amp; carries the keys of the  cities <a id="l105"></a>of the two first kingdoms in his hand. And being exalted above <a id="l106"></a>kings &amp; declared  by a Council above all humane judicature <a id="l107"></a>&amp; the supreme judge of all men, he has reigned ever since with <a id="l108"></a>a peculiar soul &amp; a look more stout then  his fellows, <a id="l109"></a>&amp; by setting up the worship of images, the abomination of <a id="l110"></a>desolation, he has changed times, &amp; laws, <em class="underline">which</em> after his rising up &amp; becoming potent by rooting up three of the first horns were to be given into his hands for a time &amp; times &amp; half a time</p>
<p id="par8">His kingdom they call Peters patrimony because given by Pipin &amp; <a id="l111"></a>Charles the great to S<sup>t</sup> Peter.  And for the same reason the keys of <a id="l112"></a>the cities of his kingdom they call S<sup>t</sup> Peters keys, they being <a id="l113"></a>offered to S<sup>t</sup> Peter upon his Confession or Altar.  But some turn<a id="l114"></a>ing history into an allegory tell us that the keys represent the <a id="l115"></a>power of binding &amp; loosing &amp; are the keys of heaven &amp; that the <a id="l116"></a>three crowns relate to heaven earth &amp; hell as if the Pope was <a id="l117"></a>crowned king of those three regions.  These are whimsies which I <a id="l118"></a>need not stay to confute  Others come nearer to the truth, who <a id="l119"></a>tell us that the crowns denote the Pontifical Imperial &amp; Royal <a id="l120"></a>power of the Pope .  <a id="l122"></a>One of his crowns was given him by Clodovæus king of the Franks <a id="l123"></a>as above.  This Crown has no relation to the Exarchate or king<a id="l124"></a>dom of Lombardy.  It was given him as Pope of Rome: &amp; after <a id="l125"></a>his subduing that city he deserved to wear it as its king.    The other two crowns came to him with <a id="l128"></a>the two golden keys upon the conquest of the exarchate &amp; kingdom <a id="l129"></a>of Lombardy, tho it was some time before he began to wear them.</p>

In this mosaick work there appears Peter <a id="l137"></a>with three keys  in his lap, reaching the Pallium to the Pope <a id="l138"></a>with his right hand &amp; the banner of the city to Charles the great <a id="l139"></a>with his left.

<p id="par10">After the death of Charles the great, his son &amp; successor <a id="l149"></a>Ludovicus Pius at the request of the Pope <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> confirmed the <a id="l150"></a>donations of his grandfather &amp; father to the sea of Rome. <a id="l151"></a>And in this Confirmation he names first Rome with its Dutchy <a id="l152"></a>extending into Tuscia &amp; Campania, then the Exarchate of <a id="l153"></a>Ravenna with Pentapolis &amp; in the third place the territories <a id="l154"></a>taken from the Lombards.  These are his three  conquests, <a id="l155"></a>&amp; he was to hold them  of the Emperor for the use of <a id="l156"></a>the Church <em class="underline">sub integritate</em> intirely without the Emperors inter<a id="l157"></a>medling therewith or with the jurisdiction or power of the <a id="l158"></a>Pope therein unless called thereunto in certain cases.  This <a id="l159"></a>ratification the Emperor made in writing under an oath.  <a id="l160"></a>And as the king of the Ostro-goths for acknowledging that he <a id="l161"></a> held his kingdom of Italy of the Greek Emperor stamped the <a id="l162"></a>Emperors effigies on one side of his coins &amp; his own  on the <a id="l163"></a>Reverse: so the Pope  made the like acknow<a id="l164"></a>ledgment to the western Emperor.  ffor the Pope began <a id="l165"></a>now to coin money &amp; the coins of Rome are henceforward <a id="l166"></a>found with the head of the Emperors  (Charles, Ludovicus Pius, Lotharius, Ludovicus II &amp;c) on one side &amp; the Popes <a id="l167"></a>on the reverse for many years.</p>

<p id="par14" class="i0">the history to his own times.  He was a ready scribe in the <a id="l231"></a>Law of God, &amp; for assisting him in this work Neemias <a id="l232"></a>founded a library, &amp; gathered together the Acts of the kings <a id="l233"></a>&amp; the Prophets &amp; of David &amp; the Epistles of the Kings <a id="l234"></a>concerning the holy gifts 2 Maccab. 2.13.  And hence it <a id="l235"></a>is that in the books of the Kings &amp; Chronicles, the book <a id="l236"></a>of Samuel the Seer, the book of Nathan the Prophet, <a id="l237"></a>&amp; the book of Gad the Seer are cited for the Acts of <a id="l238"></a>David; the book of the Acts of Solomon, the book of Nathan <a id="l239"></a>the Prophet, the Prophesy of Ahijah the Shilonite, &amp; the <a id="l240"></a>visions of Iddo the Seer for the acts of Solomon; the book <a id="l241"></a>of Shemaiah the Prophet, &amp; the book of Iddo the Seer con<a id="l242"></a>cerning genealogies for the acts of Rehoboam &amp; Abijah; <a id="l243"></a>the book of Iehu the son of Hananai the Seer for the acts of <a id="l244"></a>Iehosaphat; the visions of Isaiah for the acts of Vzziah <a id="l245"></a>&amp; Hezekiah, &amp;c.  Out of these &amp; other ancient Records <a id="l246"></a>collected by Nehemias, the books of Samuel Kings &amp; Chro<a id="l247"></a>nicles were composed by Ezra; &amp; in doing this he joyned <a id="l248"></a>those Records together in due order of time, copying <a id="l249"></a>the very words of the authors, as is manifest from <a id="l250"></a>hence that the books of the kings &amp; Chronicles frequently <a id="l251"></a>agree with one another in words for many sentences <a id="l252"></a>together.  Where they agree in sense there they <a id="l253"></a>agree in words.</p>
<p id="par15">In these books &amp; the books of Nehemiah &amp; Esther, We <a id="l254"></a>have the history &amp; chronology of the people of Israel down <a id="l255"></a>to the times of Ezra &amp; Nehemiah: which times are fully stated by Eclipses of the Sun &amp; Moon mentioned by <a id="l256"></a>Thucydides &amp; Ptolomy.  But the Records of other nations <a id="l257"></a>written before thosetimes being all of them lost, it <a id="l258"></a>is very difficult to give a true account of the ancient <a id="l259"></a>affairs of those nations, &amp; the best way to come to any <a id="l260"></a>certainty therein, is to begin with the later times where <a id="l261"></a>history &amp; chronology is certain, &amp; reccon upwards as <a id="l262"></a>high as we can proceed by any good arguments.  But <a id="l263"></a>first it will be requisite to say something of the years &amp; <a id="l264"></a>months of the ancient nations.</p>
