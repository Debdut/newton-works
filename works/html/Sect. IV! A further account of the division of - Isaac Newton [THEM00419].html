<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span>
that he disputes for the Deity or worship of the holy Ghost <a id="l54"></a>in all his works. His opinion about this matter you may know <a id="l55"></a>by the end of his last book de Trinitate. The Council of <a id="l56"></a>Paris convened out of all France by the means of Hilary A.C. <a id="l57"></a>361 in a large profession of their faith, contend only for the <a id="l58"></a>deity of the Son. Auxentius bishop of Millain ten years <a id="l59"></a>after the Councils of Millain Sirmium &amp; Ariminum, that is A.C. <a id="l60"></a>365   was vehemently accused of Arianism by Hilary,  before the Emperor <a id="l61"></a>Valentinian who was that year at Millain till September, &amp; defended himself about the deity of the Son without acknow<a id="l62"></a>ledging the deity of the holy Ghost or being accused by Hi<a id="l63"></a>lary of denying it, &amp; was acquitted, as you may see in ~ <a id="l64"></a>Hilaries book against him &amp; his defense annexed to it.  . And therefore the controversy <a id="l65"></a>about the deity &amp; worship of the holy Ghost was not yet <a id="l66"></a>begun in the west. It seems the western bishops were <a id="l67"></a>willing to let the deity of the holy Ghost alone till <a id="l68"></a>that of the Son was established. </p>
<p id="par4">But after the consubstantiality &amp; coequal Deity <a id="l69"></a>of the Son was by the influence of the bishop of Rome <a id="l70"></a>&amp; industry of Hilary, Eusebius Vercellensis &amp; others <a id="l71"></a>sufficiently established in the west, Pope Damasus A.C. <a id="l72"></a>373 called a Council of 93 Bishops at Rome, &amp; this <a id="l73"></a>Council sent a letter to a Council convened at the <a id="l74"></a>same time in <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Illyricum<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> in which letter they thus describe their <a id="l75"></a>faith. <sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> <em class="underline">When the evil of the hereticks began to be <a id="l76"></a>in vigor, as the blasphemy of the Arians is now <a id="l77"></a>especially, which God remove, the three hundred and <a id="l78"></a>eighteen  select fathers treating of the matter <a id="l79"></a>at Nice erected this wall against the arms of the <a id="l80"></a>Devil &amp; repelled the deadly poison with this antidote <a id="l81"></a>that the father &amp; Son should be beleived of one <a id="l82"></a>essence one Godhead one vertue one power &amp; one <a id="l83"></a>form.

It is also called the City where our Lord was crucified, that is the city which makes war with <a id="l178"></a>the saints &amp; overcomes them &amp;  is drunk with the blood of the martyrs of Iesus  &amp; kills his witnesses the city of the <a id="l179"></a>twelve Tribes who rebelled against Christ received the mark of the Beast, &amp; crucified the Lord afresh, that is, the great Antichrist, for the <a id="l180"></a>ten kings make war with the Lamb.

For Candlesticks are churches Apoc. 1.20. The nations  receive the mark of the Beast &amp; worship his Image before the pouring out of the first Vial Apoc. 16.2.

For as the worship of the heathen Gods decreased,  the in<a id="l744"></a>vocation of Saints &amp; other heathen superstitions came in among the Christians being introduced by ascribing supernatural <a id="l745"></a>powers to the souls of the saints &amp; to their reliques &amp; Shrines &amp; to certain ceremonies of the <a id="l746"></a>same kind with the heathen superstitions such as were signing with a cross, in nomine ✝ Patris &amp; ✝ filij et ✝ spiritus sancti sprinkling <a id="l747"></a>with Holy water &amp; annoynting with consecrated oyle &amp; these superstitions were much propagated by writing Legends of <a id="l748"></a>the miracles pretended to be done by them &amp; ordering the Legends to be read in churches  for the instruction of the people. </p>
<p id="par44">In the reign of Constantine &amp; his sons the Christians by an unwary zeal <a id="l749"></a>began to use the signe of the cross with too much superstition &amp; in honour to the Martyrs to  pray at the tombs of the martyrs  &amp; to trans<a id="l751"></a>late the bodies of the Martyrs into their churches turning the Christian <a id="l752"></a>Churches into sepulchres of the saints as the heathen temples were the sepulchres <a id="l753"></a>  houses of their Gods. </p> 
<p id="par45">In the reign of Constantius some began to tell stories of the souls <a id="l754"></a>of dead men appearing to them &amp; of miracles done by the signe of <a id="l755"></a>the cross &amp; in Egypt they began to keep the bodies of the Martyrs &amp; good men unburied upon beds in their houses . In the reign of Iulian the Apostate there began to be <a id="l756"></a>a rumour of miracles done by the  reliques of the Martyrs &amp; <a id="l757"></a>in the reign of Valentinian &amp; Valens those miracles were every where <a id="l758"></a>preached up &amp; reliques were sent into all the Empire from Egypt &amp; <a id="l759"></a>Syria where the mischief began, &amp; the invocation of the saints was <a id="l760"></a>at the same time set on foot by Oratorical flourishes between jeast <a id="l761"></a>&amp; earnest, &amp; by stories of the good effects of such devotion, untill <a id="l762"></a>the doctrine that the saints did hear &amp; help was brought  into <a id="l763"></a>the Churches &amp; the oratorical flourishes ended in direct &amp; positive <a id="l764"></a>prayers: so that in the reign of Theodosius this heathen doctrine <a id="l765"></a>that the Saints did hear &amp; help us, &amp; the idolatrous practise of praying <a id="l766"></a>to them overspread as well the western as the eastern churches, &amp; <a id="l767"></a>before his death or at the furthest in the reign of his sons was <a id="l768"></a>generaly received &amp; fully established in all the Roman Empire, <a id="l769"></a>the whole world ringing with the noise of the miracles said to be <a id="l770"></a>done every where at the shrines of the saints. And in setting up <a id="l771"></a>this new religion the  the Monks were very active who feigning miracles <a id="l772"></a>&amp; pretending by extraordinary dreams &amp; revelations to discover where <a id="l773"></a>the bodies of the saints &amp; martyrs were buried, dug up the bones of <a id="l774"></a>the dead &amp; carried them up &amp; down the Empire &amp; did it so very <a id="l775"></a>much that some recconed this to be the first resurrection spoken <a id="l776"></a>of in the Apocalyps &amp; that the Emperors at length forbad these <a id="l777"></a>shameful practises by publick edicts.

And  thirteen years after, when the second <a id="l796"></a>Angel sounded,   A.C. 408, the western Empire became at once divided <a id="l797"></a>into ten kingdoms   which makes good <a id="l798"></a>the prophesy of the ten horns. <em class="underline">The ten horn which thou sawest are <a id="l799"></a>ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet</em> [ id est in the time of <a id="l800"></a>the sixt head ] <em class="underline">but receive power as kings the same hour  with <a id="l801"></a>the Beast</em> or in a very short time,  as it were with in an hour,  after the Beast 's receiving <a id="l802"></a>the throne of the Dragon. Thus did the Beast after he was wounded <a id="l803"></a>to death, recover &amp; arrive to  his perfect state by degrees. First <a id="l804"></a>he revived, then he rose out of the sea, then he received his throne <a id="l805"></a>from the Dragon who stood upon the sea-shore &amp;  then became divided into the ten kingdoms <a id="l807"></a>represented by his horns. </p>
<p id="par48"><em class="underline">And all the world wondered after the Beast, </em> or, as is afterwards <a id="l808"></a>exprest, all they that dwell on the earth whose names are not written in <a id="l809"></a>the book of life.

<p id="par49"><em class="underline">And there was given him a mouth</em> [ or legislative power ] <em class="underline">speaking <a id="l818"></a>great things</em>  &amp; blasphemies [ against the God of  Gods in setting up <a id="l819"></a> the worship of other Gods &amp; their images ]  <em class="underline">&amp; power was given him  to</em>  <em class="underline">continue</em> [ in this manner of acting ] <em class="underline">forty &amp; two months. <a id="l821"></a>&amp;</em> [ all this time  ] <em class="underline">he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to <a id="l822"></a>blaspheme his name &amp; his tabernacle &amp; them that dwell in heaven</em> <a id="l823"></a>The 42 months are not the whole time of his continuing  <a id="l824"></a>but the time only of his blaspheming after he is arrived to the height of <a id="l825"></a>impiety.

<p id="par50"><em class="underline">And it was given unto him to make war with the saints &amp; to overcome <a id="l828"></a>them &amp; power was given him  over all <a id="l829"></a>kindreds &amp; tongues &amp; nations.
