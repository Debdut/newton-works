<p id="par12">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz by his Letter of 29 Decem 1711 justified the Passage <a id="l37"></a>in the Acta Eruditorum for Ianuary 1705 pag. 34 &amp; 35, &amp; thereby made it his <a id="l38"></a>own, &amp; now endeavours in vain to excuse it, pretending that the words <em class="underline">adhibet <a id="l39"></a>semperque adhibuit</em> are malitiously interpreted by the Word <em class="underline">substituit</em>. But in the <a id="l40"></a>interpretation which he would put upon the place he omitts the words <em class="underline">igitur</em> &amp; <a id="l41"></a><em class="underline">quemadmodum</em>, the first of which makes the words <em class="underline">semperque adhibuit</em> a con<a id="l42"></a>sequence of what went before &amp; the latter makes them equipollent to <em class="underline">substituit</em> <a id="l43"></a>neither of which can be true in the sense which M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz endeavours now <a id="l44"></a>to put upon the words.</p>

Society to condemn <a id="l45"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Keill without hearing both parties, &amp; when the Doctor put in his Answer, M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l46"></a>Leibnitz refused to give his reasons against the Doctor &amp; called it injustice to <a id="l47"></a>expect it from him, &amp;  yet per<a id="l48"></a>sisted in pressing them against him &amp; thereby put them upon a necessity of <a id="l49"></a>appointing a Committee to search out old papers &amp; give their opinion upon <a id="l50"></a>them. If they did it without him it was his own fault: he was for over-<a id="l51"></a>ruling them, and called it injustice to expect that he should defend his candor <a id="l52"></a>&amp; plead before them. If they gave him no opportunity to except against <a id="l53"></a>any of the Committee it was because he refused to be heard &amp; they had <a id="l54"></a>sufficient authority to appoint a Committee without him, &amp; he had no right <a id="l55"></a>to except against what they did for their own satisfaction. If they have <a id="l56"></a>not yet given judgment against him; it is because the Committee did not <a id="l57"></a>act as a Iury, nor the R. Society as a formal Court of justice. The Committe <a id="l58"></a>examined old Letters &amp; Papers &amp; gave their opinion upon them alone, &amp; left <a id="l59"></a>room for M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz to produce further evidence for himself. And it is <a id="l60"></a>sufficient that the Society ordered their Report with the Papers upon which <a id="l61"></a>it was grownded to be published, &amp; that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in all the three years <a id="l62"></a>&amp; four months which are since elapsed has not been able to produce any <a id="l63"></a>further proof against D<sup>r</sup> Keill then what was then before them.</p>
<p id="par14">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz saith that the Letter which I call defamatory being no <a id="l64"></a>sharper than that which has been published against him I have no reason to <a id="l65"></a>complain. But the sharpness of the Letter lies in accusations &amp; reflexions <a id="l66"></a>without any proof which way of writing is unlawful &amp; infamous: the sharpnes <a id="l67"></a>of the Commercium lies in facts which are lawfull  &amp; fit to <a id="l68"></a>be produced. The Letter was published in a clandestine back-biting manner <a id="l69"></a>(as defamatory papers use to be) without the name of the author or Ma<a id="l70"></a>thematician or Printer or City where it was printed, &amp; was dispersed above <a id="l71"></a>two years before we were told that the Mathematician was Iohn Ber<a id="l72"></a>noulli, the Commercium was printed openly at London by order of the <a id="l73"></a>R. Society.</p>
<p id="par15">The Mathematician to whom M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz appealed from the R. <a id="l74"></a>Society, I called a Mathematician or pretended Mathematician, not to disparage <a id="l75"></a>the skill of M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli, but because the Mathematician in his Letter of the <a id="l76"></a>7<sup>th</sup> of Iune 1673 cited M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli as a person distinct from himself, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l77"></a>Leibnitz lately caused that Letter to be reprinted without the citation &amp; tells <a id="l78"></a>us that the Mathematician was M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli himself, &amp; whether the Mathe<a id="l79"></a>matician  or M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz is to be believed I do not know.</p>
<p id="par16">He complains that the Committee have gone out of the way in <a id="l80"></a>falling upon the method of Series: but he should consider that both <a id="l81"></a>methods are but two branches of one general method. I joyned them <a id="l82"></a>together in my Analysis. I interwove them in the Tract which I wrote <a id="l83"></a>in the year 1671 as I said in my Letters of the 10 Decem 1672 &amp; 24 Octob <a id="l84"></a>1676. In my Letter of 13 Iune 1676, I said that my method of series <a id="l85"></a>extended to almost all Problems but became not general without some <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p447v"> &lt;447v&gt; </span> other methods, meaning (as I said in my next Letter) the method of <a id="l86"></a>fluxions, and the method of arbitrary series, &amp; now to take those other <a id="l87"></a>methods from me is to restrain and stint the method of series &amp; make it ceas<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l88"></a>to be general. In my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 I called all these method<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l89"></a>together my general method. See the Commercium Epistolicum pag. 86. lin. 16. <a id="l90"></a>And if M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz has been tearing this general method in pieces &amp; <a id="l91"></a>taking from me first one part &amp; then another part whereby the rest <a id="l92"></a>is maimed, he has given a just occasion to the Committee to consider <a id="l93"></a>the whole. It is also to be observed that  he is perpetually <a id="l94"></a>giving testimony for himself, &amp; its allowed in all Courts of justice to <a id="l95"></a>speak to the credit of the witness.</p>
<p id="par17">He represents that the Committee of the R. Society have omitted <a id="l96"></a>things which made against me &amp; printed every thing which could be turned <a id="l97"></a>against him by strained glosses, &amp; to make this appear he produced <a id="l98"></a>in his last Letter but one an instance of my ignorance omitted by them but confesses <a id="l99"></a>now that he was mistaken in saying that it was omitted &amp; saith that he <a id="l100"></a>will cite another instance. In one of my Letters to M<sup>r</sup> Collins  he saith that I owned that I <a id="l102"></a>could not find the second segments of SphÃ¦roids &amp; that the Committee <a id="l103"></a>have omitted this. If they had omitted such a passage I think they <a id="l104"></a>would have done right it being nothing to the purpose. But on the <a id="l105"></a>contrary  M<sup>r</sup>  Collins in a Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Iames Gregory 24 Decem. <a id="l110"></a>1670 &amp; in another to M<sup>r</sup> Bertet 21 Feb 1671 both printed in the Commercium Epistolicum p. 24, 26 wrote that my method <a id="l111"></a>extended to second segments of round solids. And M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg <a id="l112"></a>wrote the same thing to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself 8 Decem. 1674. See <a id="l113"></a>the Commer. Epist. p. 39. So you see that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz hath accused <a id="l114"></a>the Committee of the R. Society without knowing the truth of his <a id="l115"></a>accusation &amp; therefore is guilty of  a misdemeanour. <a id="l116"></a>The Committee were so far from acting corruptly against M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l117"></a>that omitted his ignorance of Geometry in those days &amp; several other things which made strongly against him, such <a id="l118"></a>as were the two Letters in my custody, &amp; the Paragraph in the Preface <a id="l119"></a>to the two first Volumes of D<sup>r</sup> Wallis's works relating to this matter <a id="l120"></a>&amp; that a copy of Gregories Letter of 5 Septem. 1670 was sent to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l121"></a>Leibnitz in Iune 1676 amongst the extracts of Gregories Letters.</p>
<p id="par18">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz acknowledges that when he was in London the second <a id="l122"></a>time he saw some of my Letters in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins, &amp; he has <a id="l123"></a>named two of those which he then saw, viz<sup>t</sup> that dated  <a id="l124"></a> 24 Octob 1676, &amp; that in which he pretends that I confessed my ignorance of second segments &amp; no doubt he would principally desire to see the <a id="l125"></a>Letter which conteined the chief of my series &amp; particularly those two <a id="l126"></a>for finding the Arc by the signe &amp; the sine by the Arc with the De<a id="l127"></a>monstration thereof which a few months before he had desired M<sup>r</sup> Olden<a id="l128"></a>burgh to procure from M<sup>r</sup> Collins, that is, the <em class="underline">Analysis per Ãquati<a id="l129"></a>ones numero terminorum infinitas</em>. But yet he tells us that he never <a id="l130"></a>saw where I explained my method of fluxions &amp; that he finds nothing <a id="l131"></a>of it in the Commercium Epistolicum where that Analysis &amp; my Letters <a id="l132"></a>of 10 Decem. 1672, 13 Iune 1676 &amp; 24 Octob. 1676 are published.</p>
<p id="par19">He saith also that he never saw where I explain the method <a id="l133"></a>claimed by me in which he assumes an arbitrary series: If he pleases <a id="l134"></a>to look into the Commercium Epistolicum pag. 56 &amp; 86 he will there see <a id="l135"></a>that I had that Method in the year 1676 &amp; five years before. M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l136"></a>Leibnitz might find it himself but not so early, &amp; second Inventors have <a id="l137"></a>no right.</p>
<p id="par20">He pretends that in my book of Principles pag. 253, 254, I allowed <a id="l138"></a>him the invention of the calculus differentialis independently of my <a id="l139"></a> own, &amp; that to attribute this invention to my self is contrary to <a id="l140"></a>my knowledge there avowed. But in the Paragraph there referred <a id="l141"></a>unto, I do not find one word to this purpose. On the contrary I there <a id="l142"></a>represent that I sent notice of my method to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz before he sent <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p448r"> &lt;448r&gt; </span> notice of his method to me, &amp; left  him to make it appear that he had <a id="l143"></a>found his method before the date of my Letter, that is, eight months at the <a id="l144"></a>least before the date of his own. And by referring to the Letters which <a id="l145"></a>passed between M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; me ten years before, I left the Reader <a id="l146"></a>to consult those Letters &amp; interpret the Paragraph thereby. For by those <a id="l147"></a>Letters he would see that I wrote a Tract of that method &amp; the method <a id="l148"></a>of Series together five years before the writing of those Letters  that is in the year 1671. And these <a id="l149"></a>hints were as much as was proper in that short Paragraph, it being besides <a id="l150"></a>the designe of that Book to enter into disputes about these matters.</p>
<p id="par21">He saith that when he was in London the first time which was in Ian &amp; Feb 1673 he knew nothing <a id="l151"></a>of  infinite series nor of the avanced Geometry nor was <a id="l152"></a>then acquainted with  M<sup>r</sup> Collins as some have mali<a id="l153"></a>ciously  feigned. But who hath feigned this or what need there was <a id="l154"></a>of feigning it I do not know. At that time D<sup>r</sup> Pell gave him notice of <a id="l155"></a>Mercators series for the Hyperbola &amp; he carried Mercators Book with him <a id="l156"></a>to Paris tho he did not yet understand the higher Geometry. And any of those <a id="l157"></a>to whom M<sup>r</sup> Collins had communicated mine &amp; Gregories Series might give <a id="l158"></a>him notice of them without his being acquainted with M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l159"></a>Collins.</p>
<p id="par22">He saith that after his coming from London to Paris his first Letters <a id="l160"></a>were of other matters then Geometrical till M<sup>r</sup> Huygens had instructed him <a id="l161"></a>in these things &amp; that he found the Arithmetical Quadrature of the <a id="l162"></a>Circle towards the end of the year 1673 &amp; began to write of it to <a id="l163"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg the next year, &amp; found the general method by arbi<a id="l164"></a>trary series a little after &amp; the differential Calculus in the year 1676 <a id="l165"></a>deducing it from the series of numbers, &amp; that in his Letter of 27 Aug. <a id="l166"></a>1676 by the words <em class="underline">certa Analysi</em> he meant the differential Analysis. <a id="l167"></a>And am not I as good a Witness that I found the methods of fluxions <a id="l168"></a>in the year 1665 &amp; improved it in the year 1666 &amp; that before the <a id="l169"></a>end of the year 1666 I wrote a small Tract on this subject which <a id="l170"></a>was the grownd of that larger Tract which I wrote in the year <a id="l171"></a>1671 (both which are still in my custody,) &amp; that in this smaller <a id="l172"></a>Tract tho I generally put letters for fluxions as D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in his <a id="l173"></a>Method of Tangents put Letters for differences, yet in giving a <a id="l174"></a>general Rule for finding the Curvature of Curves I put the <a id="l175"></a>letter x with one prick for first fluxions drawn into their fluents &amp; with two pricks for <a id="l176"></a>second fluxions drawn into the square of their fluents, &amp; that when I wrote the larger of those two <a id="l177"></a>Tracts I had made my Analysis composed of those two methods <a id="l178"></a>so universal as to reach to almost all sorts of Problemes as <a id="l179"></a>I mentioned in my Letter of 13 Iune 1676.</p>
<p id="par23">In the year 1684 M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz published only the Elements <a id="l180"></a>of the Calculus differentialis &amp; applied them to questions about  <a id="l181"></a>Tangents &amp; Maxima &amp; minima,  as Fermat Gregory &amp; <a id="l182"></a>Barrow had done before, &amp; shewed how to proceed in these Questions without <a id="l183"></a>taking away surds, but proceeded not to the higher Problemes. The Principia <a id="l184"></a>mathematica gave the first instances made publick of applying this Calculus <a id="l185"></a>to the higher Problemes &amp; I understood M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in this sense in what <a id="l186"></a>I said concerning the Acta Eruditorum for May 1700 pag. 206. But M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l187"></a>Leibnitz observes that what was there said by him relates only to a par<a id="l188"></a>ticular artifice de maximis et minimis with which he there allowed <a id="l189"></a>that I was acquainted when I gave the figure of my vessel in my <a id="l190"></a>Principles. But this Artifice depending npon the differential method <a id="l191"></a>as an improvement thereof, &amp; being the artifice by which they solved <a id="l192"></a>the Problemes which they value themselves most upon (those of the linea <a id="l193"></a>celerrimi descensus &amp; the linea Catenaria &amp; Velaria) &amp; which M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l194"></a>Leibnitz <a id="l195"></a>there calls a method of the highest moment &amp; greatest extent, I content <a id="l196"></a>my self with his acknowledgement that I was the first that proved by a <a id="l197"></a>specimen made publick, that I had this artifice.</p>
<p id="par24">In the year 1689 M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz published the principal Propositions of this <a id="l198"></a>Book as his own in three papers called Epistola de Lineis Opticis, Schediasma de <a id="l199"></a> resistentia Medij &amp; motu projectilium gravium in Medio resistente, et Ten<a id="l200"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p448v"> &lt;448v&gt; </span>tamen de motuum cÅlestium causis, pretending that he had found them all <a id="l201"></a>before that book came abroad. And to make the principal Proposition his own <a id="l202"></a>adapted to it an erroneous Demonstration. And this was the second specimen <a id="l203"></a>made publick of applying the method to the higher Problemes. Hitherto this me<a id="l204"></a>thod made no noise, but within a year or two it began to be celebrated.</p>
<p id="par25">D<sup>r</sup> Barrow printed his differential method of Tangents in the year <a id="l205"></a>1670. M<sup>r</sup> Gregory from this method compared with his own deduced a general <a id="l206"></a>method of Tangents without calculation &amp; by his Letter of 5 Sept. 1670 gave <a id="l207"></a>notice thereof to M<sup>r</sup> Collins. Slusius in November 1672 gave notice of the <a id="l208"></a>like method to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburgh. In my Letter of 10 Decem. 1672 I sent the <a id="l209"></a>like method to M<sup>r</sup>  Collins &amp; added that I  mentioned it to <a id="l210"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Barrow when he was printing his Lectures, &amp; that I took the method of <a id="l211"></a>Gregory &amp; Slusius to be the same with mine, &amp; that it was but a branch <a id="l212"></a>or Corollary of a general method which without any troublesome calcula<a id="l213"></a>tion extended not only to tangents but also to other abstruser sorts of <a id="l214"></a>Problemes concerning the crookedness, areas, lengths, centers of gravity <a id="l215"></a>of Curves &amp;c &amp; did all this even without freeing equations from surds; &amp; I <a id="l216"></a>added that I had interwoven this method with that of infinite series, <a id="l217"></a>meaning in the Tract which I wrote in the year 1671. Copies of these <a id="l218"></a>two Letters were sent to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz by M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburge in the Extracts <a id="l219"></a>of Gregories Letters in Iune 1676, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Letter 21 Iune <a id="l220"></a>1677 sent nothing more back then what he had notice of by these two <a id="l221"></a>Letters, namely, D<sup>r</sup> Barrows Differential Method of Tangents disguised <a id="l222"></a>by a new notation, &amp; extended to the method of Tangents of Gregory &amp; <a id="l223"></a>Slusius, &amp; to Equations involving surds, &amp; to Quadratures. But this is not the <a id="l224"></a>case between me and D<sup>r</sup> Barrow. He saw my Tract of Analysis in the <a id="l225"></a>year 1699 &amp; was pleased with it. And before his Lectures came abroad <a id="l226"></a>I had deduced the method of Tangents of Gregory &amp; Slusius from my <a id="l227"></a>general method. But M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in those days knew nothing of the higher <a id="l228"></a>Geometry nor was yet acquainted with  the vulgar Algebra.</p>
<p id="par26">In his Letter of 27 Aug. 1676, he wrote thus. Quod dicere videmini <a id="l229"></a>plerasque difficultates (exceptis problematibus DiophantÃ¦is) ad series infinitas <a id="l230"></a>reduci, id mihi non videtur. Sunt enim multa usque adeo mira et implexa <a id="l231"></a>ut neque ab Ã¦quationibus pendeant neque ex Quadraturis. Qualia sunt ex <a id="l232"></a>multis alijs Problemata methodi tangentium inversÃ¦. And when I answered <a id="l233"></a>that such Problems were in my power he replied (in his Letter of 21 Iune <a id="l234"></a>1677) that he conceived that I meant by infinite series but he meant by <a id="l235"></a>vulgar equations. See the Answer to this in the Commercium Epistolicum p. 92.</p>
<p id="par27">He saith that one may judge that when he wrote his Letter of 27 <a id="l236"></a>Aug. 1676, he had some entrance into the differential Calculus because  <a id="l237"></a>he said there that he had solved the Probleme of Beaune certa Analysi <a id="l238"></a>by a certain Analysis. But what if that Probleme may be solved <a id="l239"></a>certa Analysi without the Differential method? For no further Ana<a id="l240"></a>lysis is requisite then this; That the Ordinate of the Curve desired <a id="l241"></a>increases or decreases in Geometrical Progression when the Abscissa in<a id="l242"></a>creases in Arithmetical, &amp; therefore the Abscissa &amp; Ordinate have the <a id="l243"></a>same relation to one another as the Logarithm &amp; its Number. And <a id="l244"></a>to infer from this that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had entrance into the differential <a id="l245"></a>method is as if one should say that Archimedes had entrance into <a id="l246"></a>it, because he drew tangents to the Spiral, Squared the Parabola &amp; <a id="l247"></a>found the proportion between the sphere and the cylynder, or that Cavalle<a id="l248"></a>rius Fermat &amp; Wallis had entrance into it because they did many <a id="l249"></a>more things of this kind.</p>

<p id="par28" class="i0">Sir</p>
<p id="par29">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz by his Letter of 29 Decem  1711 justified the <a id="l250"></a>Passage in the Acta Eruditorum for Ianuary 1705 pag 34 &amp; 35, &amp; thereby made <a id="l251"></a>it his own, &amp; now endeavours in vain to excuse it, pretending that the <a id="l252"></a>words <em class="underline">adhibet semperque adhibuit</em> are malitiously interpreted by the <a id="l253"></a>word substituit. But in his interpretation he omits the words <em class="underline">igitur</em> &amp; <em class="underline">quemadmodum</em> which makes the words  <em class="underline">semper<a id="l254"></a>que adhibuit</em> a consequence of what went before, &amp; the latter makes them <a id="l255"></a>equipollent to <em class="underline">substituit</em>, neither of which can be true in the sense which M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz now <a id="l256"></a>endeavours to put upon those words. And therefore he &amp;  his  friends are the aggressors.</p>
<p id="par30">9 He pretends that in my book of Principles pag. 253, 254 I allowed him the <a id="l257"></a>invention of the calculus differentialis independently of my own  &amp; that <a id="l258"></a>to attribute  this invention  to my self is contrary to my <a id="l259"></a>knowledge  there avowed. But    I do <a id="l261"></a>not find one word  in all that book to this purpose. On the contrary, in that very place which he cites, I said that I sent him notice of my method before he sent me notice of his, &amp; by the Letters it appears that I sent him notice that I had the method six years before he sent me notice that he had it, &amp; that  he did not send me notice of his method till some months after had notice of mine &amp; by the notice which I gave him  he had light into my method so far as to be able to compare the methods &amp; see the likeness.   In the year 1685 when I was writing the book of Principles, M<sup>r</sup> Craight brought to me the Acta eruditorum for October preceding  &amp; desired me to explain to him the elements of the <a id="l270"></a>calculus differentialis conteined therein &amp; I did so &amp; told him that  the <a id="l271"></a>method was mine as would appear if the Letters which had passed between <a id="l272"></a> M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; me a few years before were published &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Craige is still alive &amp; remembers this; &amp; therefore <a id="l273"></a>I could not mean in the Book of Principles to allow that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was <a id="l274"></a>the first inventor or found the Method without receiving some light from me. All that he <a id="l275"></a>can pretend to is in that book I did not accuse him. For he did not then pretend to be the first <a id="l277"></a>inventor, &amp; I have indoustriously avoided contentions all my life.</p>
<p id="par31">He represents that the Committee of the R. Society have omitted <a id="l278"></a>things which made against me &amp; printed every thing which could be turned <a id="l279"></a>against him by  strained glosses, &amp; to make this appear he <a id="l280"></a>produced  in his Last letter but one, an instance of something omitted but confesses now that <a id="l281"></a>  it was not omitted &amp; offers at another instance:  He saith that in one of <a id="l282"></a>my Letters to M<sup>r</sup> Collins he means that of <span class="hspac-n" title="8 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> 1672 not yet printed) I owned that I could not find the second <a id="l283"></a>segments of Spheroids &amp; that the Committee have omitted this.  If the Committee had omitted such a  passage I think they <a id="l285"></a>would have done right it being nothing to the purpose. But on the <a id="l286"></a>contrary M<sup>r</sup> Collins in a Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Iames Gregory dated 24 De<a id="l287"></a>cem. 1670 &amp; printed in the Commercium pag 24 wrote that my method <a id="l288"></a>extended to the second segments of round solids. And M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg wrote the same thing to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself 8 Dec. 1674. See the Comerc. p. 39. And in the very Letter which <a id="l289"></a>he mentions &amp; which was writ in the year 1672 I give the dimensions <a id="l290"></a>of the second segments of the spheroid  in a series, &amp; only say that <a id="l291"></a>the series is not fit for gauging of vessels. And such a series <a id="l292"></a>I set down also in my Letter of 13 Iune 1676 &amp; the same was pub<a id="l293"></a>lilshed in the Commercium p. 55. So you see that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz has only <a id="l294"></a>dreamt that the Committee have acted partially. They were so far from acting partially that I my self forbore to give them two letters which were in my custody &amp; made against him</p>
<p id="par32"> In his Letter of 4 Mar. st. n 1711 pressed the R. Society <a id="l295"></a>to condemn D<sup>r</sup> Keill without hearing both parties, &amp; when the Doctor put in <a id="l296"></a>his Answer, M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz refused to give his reasons against the Doctor &amp; <a id="l297"></a>called it injustice to expect it from him, &amp; thereby put the R. Society upon a <a id="l298"></a>necessity of  appointing a Committee to search out old papers &amp; give their <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p449v"> &lt;449v&gt; </span> opinion upon them. If they did it without him it was his own fault, he <a id="l299"></a>was for over-ruling them &amp; called it injustice to expect that he should <a id="l300"></a> defend his candor &amp; plead before them. If they gave him no opportunity to except against any <a id="l301"></a>of the Committee,  it was because he refused to be heard &amp; they <a id="l302"></a>had sufficient authority to  appoint a Committee without him. If they have <a id="l303"></a>not yet given judgment against him it is because the Committee did not act <a id="l304"></a>as a Iury nor the R. Society as a formal Court of justice. The Com<a id="l305"></a>mittee examined old Letters &amp; Papers gave their opinion only upon them  &amp; left room for M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz to produce further evidence for himself. And it is sufficient that the Society ordered <a id="l307"></a>their Report with the Papers upon which it was grounded &amp; to be published &amp; that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  in all <a id="l308"></a>the three years &amp; four months which are since elapsed has not <a id="l309"></a>been able to produce any further proof   against D<sup>r</sup> Keill then <a id="l310"></a>what was then before them, &amp; that M<sup>r</sup> Newton himself forbore to produce some Letters against M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz which he had then in his custody, <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 450r &gt; </span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 449v resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par33">4 The Mathematician  to whom M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz appealed <a id="l311"></a>from the R. Society I called a Mathematician or pretended Mathe<a id="l312"></a>matician, not to disparage the skill of M<sup>r</sup>Bernoulli but  because <a id="l313"></a>the Mathematician in his Letter of 7 Iune 1673 cited M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli <a id="l314"></a>as a person different from himself, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz has lately <a id="l315"></a>caused the Letter to be reprinted without the citation &amp; tells us <a id="l316"></a>that the Mathematician was   M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli himself, &amp; whether <a id="l317"></a>the Mathematician or M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz is to be believed I do not yet know. </p>
<p id="par34">3 M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz saith that the Letter which I call defamatory <a id="l318"></a>being no sharper then that which has been published against him <a id="l319"></a>I have no reason to complain. But the sharpness of the Letter lies <a id="l320"></a>in accusations &amp; reflexions without any proof;  which  way of writing is <a id="l321"></a> unlawfull  &amp;  infamous: the sharpness of the Commercium lies in <a id="l322"></a>facts which are lawfull &amp; fit to be produced. The Letter was pub<a id="l323"></a>lished in a clandestine back-biting manner (as defamatory Libels use to <a id="l324"></a>be) without the name of the author or Mathematician or printer <a id="l325"></a>or city where it was printed, &amp; dispersed  above two years <a id="l326"></a>before we were told that the Mathematician was Iohn Bernoulli: <a id="l327"></a>the Commercium was printed openly at London by order of the R. Society.</p>
<p id="par35">10 He saith that when he was in London the first time,   he knew nothing of infinite series nor of the avanced Geometry nor was then <a id="l328"></a>acquainted with M<sup>r</sup> Collins as some have maliciously feigned. But who <a id="l329"></a>has feigned this or what need there was to feign it I do not know D<sup>r</sup> <a id="l330"></a>Pell  at that time gave him notice of Mercators series for the Hyperbola &amp; he <a id="l331"></a>might have notice of mine for the circle either at London or Paris <a id="l332"></a>without being acquainted with  M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l333"></a>Collins.</p>
<p id="par36">11 He saith that after his  coming from London to Paris his first Letters were of other matters  till M<sup>r</sup> Hugens had instructed him in these things &amp; that he found the arithmetical quadrature of the circle <a id="l334"></a>towards the end of the year 1673 &amp; began to write of it to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg the next ye<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 450r &gt; </span>ar, &amp; found<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 449v resumes &gt; </span> the general method by arbi<a id="l335"></a>trary series , &amp; the differential calculus  in the year 1<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 450r &gt; </span>676<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 449v resumes &gt; </span>, deducing it from the differences of the series of numbers &amp; that in his Letter of 27 Aug. 1676 by the words <a id="l337"></a><em class="underline">certa Analysi</em> he meant the differential Analysis. And am not I <a id="l338"></a>as good a witness that I found the method of fluxions in the year <a id="l339"></a>1665 &amp; improved it in the year 1666, &amp; that before the end of <a id="l340"></a>the year 1666 I wrote a small Tract on this subject which was <a id="l341"></a>the grownd of that larger Tract which I wrote in the year 1671, both which are still in my custody &amp; that in this <a id="l342"></a>smaller Tract tho I generally put letters for fluxions  as D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in his method of Tangents put letters <a id="l344"></a>for differences, yet in giving a general Rule for finding the <a id="l345"></a>curvature of curves, I put the letter x with one prick for <a id="l346"></a>first fluxions &amp; with two pricks for second fluxions<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from between the lines of f 449v &gt; </span>, &amp; that when I w<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p450r-a"> &lt;450r&gt; </span>rote the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p449v-b"> &lt;449v&gt; </span> larger of those two Tracts I had made my Analysis composed of those two methods so universal as to reach <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p450r-b"> &lt;450r&gt; </span>to almost all <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p449v-c"> &lt;449v&gt; </span> sorts of Problemes as I mentioned in my Letter of 13 Iune 1676.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 449v resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par37">13 In the year 1684 M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz published only the elements <a id="l347"></a>of the Calculus differentialis &amp; applied them to questions about <a id="l348"></a>tangents &amp; maxima &amp; minima, but proceeded not to the higher <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p450r-c"> &lt;450r&gt; </span> </p>
<p id="par38">13 D<sup>r</sup> Barrow printed his differential method of Tangents in  the year <a id="l361"></a>1670. M<sup>r</sup> Gregory from this method compared with his own deduced a general <a id="l362"></a>method of Tangents without calculation &amp; by his Letter of 5 Sept 1670 <a id="l363"></a>gave notice thereof to M<sup>r</sup> Collins. Slusius in  November 1672 gave notice <a id="l364"></a>of the like method to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburge. In my Letter of 10 Decem. 1672 <a id="l365"></a>I sent the like method to M<sup>r</sup> Collins, &amp; added that I mentioned it to D<sup>r</sup> Barrow when he was printing his Lectures &amp; that I tooke the method of <a id="l366"></a>Gregory &amp; Slusius to be the same with mine, &amp; that it was but a branch <a id="l367"></a>or rather a Corollary of a general method which without any trouble<a id="l368"></a>some calculation extended not only to tangents but also to other <a id="l369"></a>abstruser sorts of Problemes concerning the crookednesses, areas <a id="l370"></a>lengths centers of gravity of Curves &amp;c and did all this even without <a id="l371"></a>freeing equations from surds: &amp; I added that I had interwoven this <a id="l372"></a>method with that of infinite series, meaning in the Tract which  I wrote in the year 1671. Copies of  these two Letters were sent to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l374"></a>Leibnitz by M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg in the Collection of Gregories Letters &amp; Papers <a id="l375"></a>in Iune 1676, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  in his Letter of 21 Iune 1677 sent <a id="l376"></a>nothing more back then what he had notice of by these two Letters,  namely <a id="l377"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Barrows differential method of Tangents disguized by a new notation <a id="l378"></a>&amp; extended to the method of Tangents of Gregory &amp; Slusius &amp; to Qua<a id="l379"></a>dratures &amp; equations involving surds. But this is not the case between <a id="l380"></a>me &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Barrow. He saw my Tract of Analysis in the year 1669 &amp; found <a id="l381"></a>no fault with it. By other papers he knew that I had these methods above two years before And when he was publishing his Lectures I told him <a id="l382"></a>of my method of drawing tangents without  computation,  which was a step further then he had gone</p>
<p id="par39">14  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Letter of 27 Aug. 1676 wrote thus. Quod dicere <a id="l384"></a>videmini plerasque difficultates (exceptis Problematibus DiophantÃ¦is) ad <a id="l385"></a>series infinitas reduci, id mihi non videtur. Sunt enim multa usque adeo <a id="l386"></a>mira et implexa ut neque ab Ã¦quationibus pendeant neque ex qua<a id="l387"></a>draturis. Qualia sunt ex multis alijs Problemata methodi tangentium <a id="l388"></a>inversÃ¦. And when I answered that such Problems were in my power <a id="l389"></a>he replied (in his Letter of 21 Iune 1677) that he conceived that I <a id="l390"></a>meant by infinite series but he meant by vulgar equations. See <a id="l391"></a>the Answer to this in the Commercium Epistolicum p. 92.</p>
<p id="par40"> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p450v"> &lt;450v&gt; </span> </p>
<p id="par41">5 He complains that the Commitee have gone out of the way in falling <a id="l405"></a>upon the method of series: but he should consider that both methods are but <a id="l406"></a>two branches of one general method. I joyned them together in my Analy<a id="l407"></a>sis. I interwove them in the Tract which I wrote in the year 1671 as I said <a id="l408"></a>in my Letters of the 10 Decem 1672 &amp; 24 Octob. 1676. In my Letter of <a id="l409"></a>13 Iune 1676, I said that my method of series extended to almost all <a id="l410"></a>Problemes, but became not general without some other methods meaning <a id="l411"></a>(as I said in my next Letter) the method of fluxions &amp; the method of <a id="l412"></a>arbitrary series, a method which depends upon that  of fluxions; <a id="l413"></a>&amp; now to take those other methods from me is to restrain &amp; stint the <a id="l414"></a>method of series &amp; make it cease to be general. In my Letter of <a id="l415"></a>24 Octob. 1676 I called all these methods together my general me<a id="l416"></a>thod. See the Commercium Epistolicum pag. 86. lin. 16. And if M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l417"></a>Leibnitz has been tearing this general method in pieces &amp; taking from <a id="l418"></a>me first one part &amp; then another part whereby the rest is maimed <a id="l419"></a>he has given a just occasion to the Committee to  consider the whole. <a id="l420"></a>It is also to be  observed that M<sup>r</sup>  Leibnitz is perpetually <a id="l421"></a>giving testimony for himself, &amp; it's allowed in all Courts of justice <a id="l422"></a>to speak to the credit of the witness.</p>
<p id="par42">7 M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  acknowledges that when he was in London <a id="l423"></a>the second time he saw some of my Letters in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins &amp; he has <a id="l424"></a>named two of those which he then saw viz<sup>t</sup> those dated <span class="hspac-n" title="6 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> 1672 &amp; 24 Octob 1676 <a id="l425"></a>&amp; no doubt he would principally desire to see the Letter which conteined the <a id="l426"></a>chief of my series &amp; the method of finding them, or Demonstration with a <a id="l427"></a>few months before he had desired M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg to procure from M<sup>r</sup> Collins <a id="l428"></a>that is, the <em class="underline">Analysis per Ã¦quationes numero terminorum infinitas</em>. <a id="l429"></a>But yet he tells us that he never saw where I explained my method <a id="l430"></a>of fluxions &amp; that he finds nothing of it in the Commercium Epistoli<a id="l431"></a>cum where that Analysis &amp; my Letters of 10 Decem. 1672, 13 Iune 1676 <a id="l432"></a>&amp; 24 Octob 1676 are published.</p>
<p id="par43">8 He saith also that he never saw where I explain the method <a id="l433"></a>claimed by me in which he assumes an arbitrary series. If he pleases to look <a id="l434"></a>into the Commercium Epistolicum pag. 56 &amp; 86 he will there see that <a id="l435"></a>I had that Method when I wrote my Letters of 24 Octob. 1676 &amp; 13 <a id="l436"></a>Iune 1676 &amp; five years before. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz might find it himself <a id="l437"></a>but not so early: &amp; second Inventors have  no right.</p>
<p id="par44">In  my Analysis perÃ¦quationes numero terminorum infinitas <a id="l438"></a>I made use of the method of fluxions direct &amp; inverse  D<sup>r</sup> Barrow communicated that Tract <a id="l439"></a>to M<sup>r</sup> Collins in Iuly 1669,  &amp; printed his differential method of Tangents</p>

<h2 id="hd3" class="left">A supplement to the Remarks.</h2>
<p id="par45">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz by telling his story put me upon doing the like in the Remarks.

<span class="pagenumber" id="p452v"> &lt;452v&gt; </span>
<p id="par47">In my Analysis per series numero terminorum infinitas  communica<a id="l460"></a>ted by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> Collins in Iuly 1669 I represented that I had  <a id="l461"></a>the Method of finding the areas &amp; lengths of Curves exactly when  it <a id="l462"></a>might be done,  that is by series which in those cases break off &amp; become <a id="l463"></a>finite equations. And this  proves that I had at that time the method of fluxions direct &amp; <a id="l464"></a>inverse so far as it is explained in the first six Propositions of the <a id="l465"></a>Book of Quadratures.  There being no other way of finding such series.</p>
<p id="par48">In the end of the year 1669 M<sup>r</sup> Collins â â â â right to it.</p>

<p id="par50">In the beginning of the year 1666 I found the Theory of colours &amp; <a id="l466"></a>in the year 1671 I was upon a designe of publishing it  with the <a id="l467"></a>methods of Series &amp; fluxions &amp; for that end I wrote a Tract that year <a id="l468"></a>upon the Method of series &amp; fluxions together, but did not finish it &amp; for a <a id="l469"></a>reason mentioned in my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 I laid aside my <a id="l470"></a>designe of publishing them till the  year 1704.</p>
<p id="par51"> After the year 1671 I intermitted these studies  five years that is till  Iune 1676, (as I mentioned in my Letters of 13 Iun &amp; 24 Octob 1676 but before I left <a id="l471"></a>of I had made  my  Analytical Method so general as is described <a id="l472"></a>in those Letters &amp; particularly in the Letter of 13 Iune 1676,  where it represented that it extended to almost all <a id="l473"></a>Problems except perhaps some numeral ones like those of Diophatus. And <a id="l474"></a>this is that Method which I described in my Letter of 10 Decem 1672. <a id="l475"></a>This method consisted in reducing Problemes to equations finite or in<a id="l476"></a>finite &amp; applying the method of fluxions either to the Equations   or to any other con<a id="l477"></a>ditions of the Problemes</p>
<p id="par52"> In April 1673 the Horologium <a id="l481"></a>Oscillatorium of M<sup>r</sup> Huygens came abroad &amp; this was the first <a id="l482"></a>book which M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz studied in learning the higher Geometry, <a id="l483"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Huygens  introducing him.</p>

<h2 id="hd4" class="cent">A Supplement to the Remarks.<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup></h2>
<p id="par61">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz by telling his own story in his Letter of 9 April <a id="l527"></a>1716 put me upon doing the like in  my Remarks upon it. And <a id="l528"></a>since in his Letters to the Comtesse of Kilmansegger &amp;  the Comte de <a id="l529"></a>Bothmer he has told it at large, I will tell the rest of my story &amp; &amp; leave <a id="l530"></a>you to beleive what you please.</p>
<p id="par62">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was in London in the beginning of the year 1673, &amp; <a id="l531"></a>going from thence to Paris in February, corresponded with M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg by <a id="l532"></a>Letters about Arithmetical matters till Iune following, being not yet acquainted with the higher Geometry. In April 1673 the Horologium <a id="l533"></a>oscillatorium of M<sup>r</sup> Huygens came abroad, &amp; this was the first book <a id="l534"></a>which he studied in learning the higher Geometry, M<sup>r</sup> Huygens intro<a id="l535"></a>ducing him. In the year 1674 M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz after a years intermission <a id="l536"></a>renewed his correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg &amp; began to write to <a id="l537"></a>him about series for finding the Area or Circumference of a circle <a id="l538"></a>or any Arc whose sine was given. And in the year 1675 M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg <a id="l539"></a>sent from M<sup>r</sup> Collins to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz several of mine &amp; Gregories series <a id="l540"></a>for the same purpose; &amp; Gregory dying in the end of the year, M<sup>r</sup> Collins <a id="l541"></a>at the request of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz collected the Letters which he had received <a id="l542"></a>from Gregory, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg in Iune 1676 sent the Collection to Paris <a id="l543"></a>to be perused &amp; returned, &amp; it is now in the Archives of the R. Society <a id="l544"></a>In this Collection were a copy of M<sup>r</sup> Gregories Letter of 5 Sept. 1670 &amp; <a id="l545"></a> a Copy of my Letter of 10 Decem 1672 to M<sup>r</sup> Collins: and by these <a id="l546"></a>Letters M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had notice that M<sup>r</sup> Barrow's method of Tangents <a id="l547"></a>was capable of improvement so as to give my general Analysis mentioned in my <a id="l548"></a>said Letter &amp; that this Analysis proceeded without sticking at surds, &amp; <a id="l549"></a>that I had  interwoven it with the Method of Series, viz<sup>t</sup> in my Ana<a id="l550"></a>lysis per series abovementioned &amp; in another Tract which I wrote upon them in the <a id="l551"></a>year 1671. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz wrote also to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg for the demonstration <a id="l552"></a>of some of my series, that is for the method of finding them, &amp; promised <a id="l553"></a>him a Reward, &amp; told him that M<sup>r</sup> Collins could help him to it; &amp; therefore <a id="l554"></a>he had heard that M<sup>r</sup> Collins had my method of series, that is, my Analysis <a id="l555"></a>per series above mentioned. For I had sent my method of series to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l556"></a>Collins in no other Paper then that. But M<sup>r</sup> Collins instead of sending a copy <a id="l557"></a>of that Tract joyned with M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg in solliciting me to write an <a id="l558"></a>Answer to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz's Letter. And thereupon I wrote my Letter of <a id="l559"></a>13 Iune 1676, which was sent to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz at the same time with the <a id="l560"></a>aforesaid Collection. And M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Answer dated 27 Aug. <a id="l561"></a>1676, replied that he did not beleive that my Analysis was so general <a id="l562"></a>as I represented, there being many Problemes, &amp; particulary the in<a id="l563"></a>verse Problemes of Tangents, not reducible to equations or quadratures. <a id="l564"></a>And in the same Letter he placed the perfection of Analysis not in the <a id="l565"></a>differential calculus as he did after he found it, but in another method <a id="l566"></a>founded on Analytical Tables of Tangents &amp; the Combinatory Art. <a id="l567"></a><em class="underline">Nihil est</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">quod norim in tota Analysi momenti majoris</em>.

And the next year upon his arrival at Hannover  a Copy of my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 <a id="l583"></a>was sent after him, &amp; in a letter to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg dated 21 Iune <a id="l584"></a>1677 he sent us his new Method with this Introduction. Clarissimi <a id="l585"></a>Slusij methodum tangentium nondum esse absolutam celeberrimo <a id="l586"></a>Newtono assentior. And in describing this method he abbreviated <a id="l587"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Barrow's method of Tangents, &amp; shewed how it might be im<a id="l588"></a>proved so as to give the Method of Slusius &amp; to proceed in Ã¦quations <a id="l589"></a>involving surds, &amp; then subjoyned: <em class="underline">Arbitror quÃ¦ celare voluit <a id="l590"></a>Newtonus de tangentibus ducendis ab his non abludere: Quod addit, <a id="l591"></a>ex eodem fundamento quadraturas reddi faciliores me in sententia <a id="l592"></a>hac confirmat.</em> And after seven years viz<sup>t</sup> in October 1684 he published the elements <a id="l593"></a>of this method  as his own without mentioning the correspondence <a id="l594"></a>which he had formerly had with  the English about these matters. <a id="l595"></a>He mentioned indeed a <em class="underline">Methodus similis</em>, but whose that method <a id="l596"></a>was &amp; what he knew of it, he did not say, as he should have <a id="l597"></a>done. And this [his silence put me upon a necessity of writing <a id="l598"></a>the Scholium upon the second Lemma of the second Book of Prin<a id="l599"></a>ciples least it should be thought that I borrowed that Lemma <a id="l600"></a>from M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz. In my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 when I had <a id="l601"></a>been speaking of the method of Fluxions I added: Fundamentum <a id="l602"></a>harum operationum, satis obvium quidem, quoniam non possum explica<a id="l603"></a>tionem ejus prosequi sic potius celavi 6accdÃ¦13eff7i3l9n404qrr<a id="l604"></a>4s9t12vx. And in the said Scholium I opened this Ã¦nigma, saying <a id="l605"></a>that it conteined the sentence <em class="underline">Data Ã¦quatione quotcunque fluentes <a id="l606"></a>quantitates involvente, fluxiones invenire,  et vice versa</em>; &amp; was <a id="l607"></a> written in the year 1676. For I looked upon this as a suffici<a id="l608"></a>ent security without entring into a wrangle: but M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l609"></a>was of another opinion.]</p>
<p id="par64">M<sup>r</sup> Iames Bernoulli in the Acta Eruditorum for December <a id="l610"></a>1691 pag. 14, said that the Calculus of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was founded on <a id="l611"></a>that of D<sup>r</sup> Barrow &amp; differed not from it except in the notation of <a id="l612"></a>Differentials &amp; some compendium of operation. And the Marquess <a id="l613"></a>de l'Hospital in the Preface to his Analysis of infinite petits pub<a id="l614"></a>lished A.C. 1696 represented that where D<sup>r</sup> Barrow left off M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l615"></a>Leibnitz proceeded, &amp; that the improvement which he made to D<sup>r</sup> <a id="l616"></a>Barrow's Analysis consisted in excluding fractions &amp; surds: but he <a id="l617"></a>did not then know that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had notice of this improvement <a id="l618"></a>from me by the two Letters above mentioned dated 10 Decem 1672 &amp; <a id="l619"></a>24 Octob. 1676. After he had notice that such an improvement <a id="l620"></a>was to be made, he might find it proprio Marte, but by that notice <a id="l621"></a>knew that I had it before him.</p>
<p id="par65">I wrote the Book of Quadratures before M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz under<a id="l622"></a>stood the Differential Analysis. For I wrote it in the year 1676, ex<a id="l623"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p454r"> &lt;454r&gt; </span>cept the Introduction &amp; Conclusion, extracting most of it out of <a id="l624"></a>old Papers. And when I had finished it &amp; the 7<sup>th</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> 9<sup>th</sup> &amp; 10<sup>th</sup> <a id="l625"></a>Propositions with their Corollaries were fresh in memory, I wrote <a id="l626"></a>upon them to M<sup>r</sup> Collins that Letter which was dated 8 Novem. 1676 <a id="l627"></a>&amp; published by M<sup>r</sup> Iones. The Tables at the end of the tenth <a id="l628"></a>Proposition for squaring of  some Curves &amp; comparing others <a id="l629"></a>with the Conic Sections were invented by the inverse Method of <a id="l630"></a>fluxions before the year 1671 as may be understood by my Letter <a id="l631"></a>of 24 Octob. 1676, where the Ordinates of the Curves are set down. <a id="l632"></a>And all the ten first Propositions of the Book of Quadratures except the fift &amp; sixt are <a id="l633"></a>in the Tract which I wrote in the year 1671 tho not in the same <a id="l634"></a>words &amp; some of them not in words  but in equations, &amp; most of <a id="l635"></a>them are in a little Tract which I wrote in autumn A.C. 1666.</p>
<p id="par66">In my Analysis above mentioned I said  of this new Method: Ad Analy<a id="l636"></a>ticam merito pertinere censeatur cujus beneficio Curvarum areÃ¦ et <a id="l637"></a>longitudines &amp;c, id modo fiat, exacte et Geometrice  determi<a id="l638"></a>nantur: sed ista narrandi non est locus. And M<sup>r</sup> Collins in his Letter <a id="l639"></a>to M<sup>r</sup> Strode above mentioned, said that by this Tract of Analysis &amp; other things <a id="l640"></a>communicated to D<sup>r</sup> Barrow, it appeared that I knew this <a id="l641"></a>method some years before the Logarithmotechnia of M<sup>r</sup> Mecator <a id="l642"></a>came abroad so as to find the area of any figure accurately if it <a id="l643"></a>may be or at least by approximation in infinitum. And in my <a id="l644"></a>Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 I represented that the Quadrature of <a id="l645"></a>Curves was improved by the method of fluxions &amp; that by that method <a id="l646"></a>I had found some general Theoremes for that end &amp; there set down <a id="l647"></a>one of those Theoremes &amp; illustrated it with examples. And in <a id="l648"></a>the six first Propositions of the Book of Quadratures I shewed <a id="l649"></a>how such Theoremes were to be found by that Method. And there<a id="l650"></a>fore  that Method so far as it is conteined in the first six Pro<a id="l651"></a>positions of the Book of Quadratures was known to me before I <a id="l652"></a>wrote the said Letter &amp;  even before I wrote the said <a id="l653"></a>Analysis &amp; before Mercators Logarithmotechnia came abroad <a id="l654"></a>there being no other method then that conteined in those six <a id="l655"></a>Propositions by which such Theoremes could be found.</p>
<p id="par67">By the inverse Method of fluxions I found in the year 1677 <a id="l656"></a>the demonnstration of Keplers Astronomical Proposition viz<sup>t</sup> that the <a id="l657"></a>Planets move in Ellipses about the lower focus with an angular velocity <a id="l658"></a>reciprocally proportional to their distance from the focus: &amp; in the <a id="l659"></a>year 1683  at the importunity of D<sup>r</sup> Halley I resumed the considerati<a id="l660"></a>on thereof, &amp; added some other Propositions about the heavenly bodies &amp; <a id="l661"></a>sent them to him that year in autumn, &amp; they were by him communicated <a id="l662"></a>to the R. Society  &amp; by their order entred in their Letter Book. And all  this was done before <a id="l663"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz published the elements of the Differential calculus.</p>
<p id="par68">In writing the Book of Principles I made much use of the method <a id="l664"></a>of fluxions direct &amp; inverse but did not set down the calculations in the <a id="l665"></a>Book it self because the Book was written by the method of composition, as <a id="l666"></a>all Geometry ought to be. And this Book was the first specimen made <a id="l667"></a>publick of the use of this method in the difficulter Problemes. The <a id="l668"></a>Marquess de l'Hospital said that this Book was presque tout de ce calcul <a id="l669"></a>And M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in a Letter to me dated <span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>7</mn><mn>17</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-6" style="width: 1.099em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 1.095em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.331em, 1001.1em, 3.066em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-7"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-8"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.827em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.324em, 1000.34em, 4.204em, -1000em); top: -4.441em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-9" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">7</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.324em, 1000.7em, 4.204em, -1000em); top: -3.586em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.354em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-10" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">17</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1000.83em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 0.827em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.474em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.433em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>7</mn><mn>17</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-2"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>7</mn><mn>17</mn></mfrac></math></script> Mart 1693: Mirifice ampliave<a id="l670"></a>ras Geometriam tuis seriebus, sed edito Principiorum opere ostendisti patere <a id="l671"></a>tibi etiam quÃ¦ Analysi receptÃ¦ non subsunt.

<p id="par69">The Book of  Principles came abroad in Spring 1687 &amp; in the Acta <a id="l684"></a>eruditorum for Ianuary 1689 M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz published a schediasma <a id="l685"></a>de resistentia Medij &amp; motu Projectorum gravium in Medio resistente. <a id="l686"></a>This Tract was writ in words at length without any calculations, <a id="l687"></a>&amp; in the end of it M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz added: Et fortassis  <a id="l688"></a>attente consideranti vias quasdam novas vel certe satis antea <a id="l689"></a>impeditas aperuisse videbimur. Omnia autem respondent nostrÃ¦ <a id="l690"></a>Analysi infinitorum, hoc est, calculo summarum et differentiarum <a id="l691"></a>(cujus elementa quÃ¦dam in his Actis dedimus) communibus quoad <a id="l692"></a>licuit verbis hic expresso. And this was the second specimen made <a id="l693"></a>public of the use of this method in the difficulter Problems. And yet <a id="l694"></a>it was nothing else then the two first Sections of the second book <a id="l695"></a>of Principles reduced into another order &amp; form of words, &amp; enlarg<a id="l696"></a>ed by an erroneus Proposition.  To find the Curve described in a <a id="l697"></a>Medium where the resistance was in a duplicate ratio of the velocity <a id="l698"></a>he composed the horizontal &amp; perpendicular motions of the projectile.</p>
<p id="par70">In the  same Acta Eruditorum for February  he published <a id="l699"></a>another Paper entituled Tentamen de motuum cÅlestium causis &amp; therin <a id="l700"></a>he endeavoured to demonstrate Keplers Proposition above mentioned, by <a id="l701"></a>the Differential Method. But the Demonstration proved an erroneous <a id="l702"></a>one. And this was the third specimen made publick of the use of <a id="l703"></a>this Method in the difficulter Problems.</p>
<p id="par71">At the request of D<sup>r</sup> Wallis I sent to him in two Letters dated <a id="l704"></a>27 Aug. &amp; 17 Septem 1692 the first Proposition of the Book of Qua<a id="l705"></a>dratures copied almost verbatim from the Book &amp; also the method of <a id="l706"></a>extracting fluents out of equations involving fluxions mentioned in <a id="l707"></a>my Letter of 24 Octob 1676 &amp; copied from an older Paper, &amp; an <a id="l708"></a>explication of the Method of fluxions direct &amp; inverse compre<a id="l709"></a>hended in the sentence Data Ã¦quatione quotcunque fluentes quantitates <a id="l710"></a>involvente, invenire fluxiones &amp; vice versa: &amp; the Doctor printed <a id="l711"></a>them all the same year (viz anno 1692) in the second volume of <a id="l712"></a>his works pag. 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, this Volume being then <a id="l713"></a>in the press &amp; coming abroad the next year, two years before the <a id="l714"></a>first Volume was printed off. And this is the first time that the use <a id="l715"></a>of letters with pricks &amp; a Rule for finding second third &amp; fourth <a id="l716"></a> fluxions were published, tho they were long before in Manuscript <a id="l717"></a>When I considered only first fluxions I seldome used  <a id="l718"></a>letters with a prick: but when I considered also second third &amp; fourth <a id="l719"></a>fluxions &amp;c I distinguished them by Letters with one two or more <a id="l720"></a>pricks: &amp; for fluents I put the fluxion either included withn a <a id="l721"></a>square (as in the aforesaid Analysis) or with a square prefixed <a id="l722"></a>(as in some other papers) or with an oblique line upon it. And then <a id="l723"></a>notations by pricks &amp; oblique lines are the most compendious yet <a id="l724"></a>used, but were not known to the Marquess de l'Hospital when he <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p455r"> &lt;455r&gt; </span> recommended the differential notation, nor are necessary to the <a id="l725"></a>method.</p>
<p id="par72">In the end of the year 1672 M<sup>r</sup> Iames Bernoulli spake contemptibly <a id="l726"></a>of the Differential Method as above. In the years 1692, 1693 &amp; 1694 <a id="l727"></a>it grew into reputation. And in spring 1695 D<sup>r</sup> Wallis hearing that <a id="l728"></a>my Method of fluxions began to be celebrated in Holland under <a id="l729"></a>the name of the Differential Method of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz, wrote in the <a id="l730"></a>Preface to the first Volume of his works that the two methods were <a id="l731"></a>the same &amp; that in my Letters of 13 Iune &amp; 24 October 1676 I ex<a id="l732"></a>plained to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz this method found by me ten years before <a id="l733"></a>or above. D<sup>r</sup> Wallis was not <em class="underline">homo novus &amp; rerum anteactarum <a id="l734"></a>parum peritus</em> as M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz objected against D<sup>r</sup> Keill. He was homo <a id="l735"></a>vetus &amp; rerum anteactarum peritus, having received copies of my <a id="l736"></a>said two Letters from M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburgh  in the very year 1676 <a id="l737"></a>when they were newly written, &amp; having had sufficient opportunity <a id="l738"></a>in those days to inform himself about this matter. By my explain<a id="l739"></a>ing the Method to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz, I suppose he meant no more then that <a id="l740"></a>in those two Letters I had said so much of it as to make it easy to find <a id="l741"></a>the rest.</p>
<p id="par73">In the yeare 1696 the Marquess de l'Hospital published his Analysis <a id="l742"></a>de infinitement petits &amp; this I think was the first time that a Rule <a id="l743"></a>for finding second third &amp; fourth differences was published. This Book <a id="l744"></a>being an Introduction to the differential Method made it spread much <a id="l745"></a>more then before. But in the year 1699 M<sup>r</sup> Fatio published that I <a id="l746"></a>was the oldest inventor by many years &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Wallis published by Letters <a id="l747"></a>in the third Volume of his works. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz returned a reply to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l748"></a>Fatio in the year 1700 &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Fatio  wrote an Answer &amp; sent it to <a id="l749"></a>the Editors of the Acta Eruditorum A.C. 1701, but they refused to print <a id="l750"></a>it, pretending an aversion to controversies. See the Acta for March <a id="l751"></a>pag. 134.</p>

<p id="par75">In the beginning of the year 1666 I found the Theory of colours &amp; <a id="l774"></a>in the year 1671 I was upon a designe of publishing it together with the <a id="l775"></a>methods of Series &amp; fluxions: but for a reason given in my Letter of <a id="l776"></a>24 Octob. 1676 I laid aside my designe of publishing them &amp; neglected <a id="l777"></a>to publish them till the year  1704 &amp; then published the Theory <a id="l778"></a>of colours &amp; the Book of Quadratures together. And writing an intro<a id="l779"></a>duction to the Book of Quadratures with relation to the method of <a id="l780"></a>fluxions upon which that Book depended: I said in that Introduction that <a id="l781"></a>I found the Method gradually in the years 1665 &amp; 1666; this being <a id="l782"></a>not so much as D<sup>r</sup> Wallis had said nine years before without being <a id="l783"></a>then contradicted.

<p id="par76">But in the Acta Eruditorum for Ianuary  1705, an account of <a id="l785"></a>the Introduction to the Book of Quadratures was published in these <a id="l786"></a>words. QuÃ¦ [Isagoge] ut  MELIVS intelligatur, sciendum est cum <a id="l787"></a>magnitudo aliqua continue crescit, veluti linea (exempli gratia) crescit <a id="l788"></a>fluxu puncti quod eam describit, incrementa illa momentanea appella<a id="l789"></a>ri  DIFFERENTIAS, nempe inter magnitudinem quÃ¦ antea erat &amp; quÃ¦ per <a id="l790"></a>mutationem momentaneam est producta; atque hinc natum esse <a id="l791"></a>Calculum Differentialem, eique reciprocum Summatorium; cujus element<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>a<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l792"></a>ab INVENTORE D.

And all this is <a id="l800"></a>as much as to say that I did not invent the method of fluxions in the <a id="l801"></a>years 1665 &amp; 1666 as I affirmed in this Introduction, but  after M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l802"></a>Leibnitz in his Letter of 21 Iune 1677 had sent me his differential <a id="l803"></a>method, instead of that method I  began to use &amp; have ever since used the method of fluxions. <a id="l804"></a></p>
<p id="par77">In the Philosophical Transaction for September &amp; October 1708 <a id="l806"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Keill published to the contrary: <em class="underline">Fluxionum Arithmeticam sine <a id="l807"></a>omni dubio primus invenit D.
