<div>
<h2 id="hd3" class="cent">Chap 1<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> <a id="l2"></a><br>A synopsis of the Prophetick ffigures.</h2>
<p id="par1">He that would understand a book written in a strange language <a id="l3"></a>must first learn the language  &amp; if he would under<a id="l4"></a>stand it well he must learn the language perfectly. Such a language <a id="l5"></a>was that wherein the Prophets wrote,  &amp; the want of sufficient <a id="l6"></a>skill in that language is the main reason why they are so <a id="l7"></a>little understood. Iohn did not write in one language, Daniel in <a id="l8"></a>another, Isaiah in  third, &amp; the rest in others peculiar to them <a id="l9"></a>selves; but they all wrote in one &amp; the same mystical language  as well known without doubt to the sons of the Prophets as the Hieroglyphic language of the Egyptians . to their Priests. <a id="l10"></a> And  this language so far as I can find, was  as  certain &amp; definite in <a id="l11"></a>its signification as is the vulgar language of any nation <a id="l12"></a>whatsoever:  so that it is only for want of skill  therein that Inter<a id="l13"></a>preters so frequently  turn the prophetic types &amp; phrases to signify <a id="l14"></a>what ever their ffansies &amp; Hypotheses lead them to. He there<a id="l15"></a>fore that would understand the old Prophets (as all Divines ought to  do) must  fix the significations of their  types &amp; phrases in <a id="l16"></a>the beginning of his studies.  Something in this kind has been <a id="l17"></a>done by former writers,  &amp; as I have endeavoured in the following <a id="l18"></a>discourse to carry on the designe further  so I hope others <a id="l19"></a>will bring it to more perfection.  The  Rule I have <a id="l20"></a>followed has been  to compare the several mystical places of scripture <a id="l21"></a>where the same prophetic phrase or type is used &amp; to fix such a signification to <a id="l22"></a>that phrase as agrees best with all the places,   &amp; if more significations <a id="l23"></a>then one   be  necessary to note the circumstances by which it <a id="l24"></a> may be known in what signification the phrase is taken in any place &amp; when I had found the necessary significations   to reject all others  as the ofspring of luxuriant fansy. ffor no more significations are to be admitted for true ones then can be proved. And <a id="l25"></a>as Criticks for understanding the Hebrew consult   also other Oriental <a id="l26"></a>Languages of the same root, so I have  not feared sometimes to  call in to my assistance the eastern  <a id="l28"></a> expositors of their mystical writers (I mean the Chalde Paraphrast &amp; the  Inter<a id="l29"></a>preters of dreams)  following herein the Example of M<sup>r</sup> Mede &amp; <a id="l30"></a> other late writers. ffor the language of the Prophets being hieroglyphical <a id="l31"></a> had affinity wth that of the  Egyptian Priests &amp; eastern wise men  &amp; therefore was anciently much better understood in the East then it is <a id="l32"></a>now in the west.   I received also much light in <a id="l33"></a>this search  by the analogy between the world natural &amp; the <a id="l34"></a>word politique.  ffor the mystical language <a id="l35"></a>was founded in this analogy &amp;  will be best understood <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p3"> &lt;IIr&gt; </span> by considering its original. That you may therefore see more clea<span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l36"></a> <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l37"></a>give you a short draught of  it as follows, <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> to the proof of the particulars.</p>
<p id="par2">1.

Whence <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l43"></a>towards heaven &amp; descending to the earth is put for rising <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l44"></a>in honour &amp; power. Rising out of the earth or waters <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l45"></a>into them, for the rising  to any  dominion or dignity out of the inferior state of people, <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l46"></a> the same into that  inferior state.

<p id="par5">4.

<p id="par6"> 5.

<p id="par7">6. If the world politique considered in Prophesy <a id="l100"></a>consists of many kingdoms they are represented by as <a id="l101"></a>many parts of the world natural: as the noblest by the <a id="l102"></a>celestial frame &amp; then the Moon &amp; Clouds are put <a id="l103"></a>for the common people, the less noble by the earth <a id="l104"></a>sea &amp; rivers &amp; by the animals or vegetables there<a id="l105"></a>in &amp; then the greater &amp; more powerfull animals <a id="l106"></a>&amp; taller trees are put for Kings &amp; Princes.

<p id="par8">7.

<p id="par9">8 When a Man is taken in a mystical sense his <a id="l140"></a>qualities are often signified by the circumstances of things <a id="l141"></a>about him.

<p id="par10">9 In the Apocalyps the world natural is represented by the <a id="l166"></a>Temple of Ierusalem &amp; the parts of this world by the analogous <a id="l167"></a>parts of the Temple: as heaven by the house of the Temple; the <a id="l168"></a>highest heaven by the most holy; the Throne of God in heaven by <a id="l169"></a>the Ark; the Sun by the bright flame of the fire of the Altar, <a id="l170"></a>or by the face of the Son of Man shining through  this flame like the <a id="l171"></a>Sun in his strength; the Moon by the burning coals upon the Altar <a id="l172"></a>convex above &amp; flat below like an half Moon; the stars by <a id="l173"></a>the Lamps; thunder by the song of the Temple &amp; lightning <a id="l174"></a>by the flashing of the fire of the Altar; the earth by <a id="l175"></a>the Area of the courts &amp; the sea by the great brazen <a id="l176"></a>Laver.

<p id="par11">Tis a familiar figure to understand the whole kingdom <a id="l178"></a>by the name of the Metropolis &amp; then the Gates, Walls, windows <a id="l179"></a>&amp; streets of the City signify as do the  heads horns eyes &amp; <a id="l180"></a>body of a beast, &amp; the regular structure &amp; glorious ornament of the City by  gold &amp; pearles &amp; pretious stones or <a id="l181"></a>otherwise is put for the justice glory &amp; majesty of its dominion.</p>
<p id="par12">Now the harmony of all these interpretations is such that <a id="l182"></a>if only some of them were proved by scripture  &amp; the Eastern <a id="l183"></a>Interpreters, the rest would be proved by the relation they have <a id="l184"></a>to these. I shall go over them in order.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="hd6" class="cent">Chap. 1. <a id="l235"></a><br>A Synopsis of the Prophetic ffigures.<br><br></h2>
<p id="par16">He that would understand a book written in a strange lan<a id="l236"></a>guage, must first learn the language &amp; if he would understand <a id="l237"></a>it well he must learn the language perfectly. Such a language <a id="l238"></a>was that wherein the Prophets wrote, &amp; the want of suffici<a id="l239"></a>ent skill in that language is the main reason why they are so <a id="l240"></a>little understood. Iohn did not write in one language, Daniel <a id="l241"></a>in another, Isaiah in a third &amp; the rest in others peculiar <a id="l242"></a>to themselves; but they all wrote in one &amp; the same mystical <a id="l243"></a>language, as well known without doubt to the sons of the Pro<a id="l244"></a>phets as the Hieroglyphick language of the Egyptians to their <a id="l245"></a>Priests. And this language so far as I can find was as certain <a id="l246"></a>&amp; definite in its signification as is the vulgar language of any <a id="l247"></a>nation whatsoever: so that it is only through want of skill therein <a id="l248"></a>that Interpreters so frequently turn the Prophetick types &amp; <a id="l249"></a>phrases to signify whatever their ffansies &amp; Hypotheses lead <a id="l250"></a>them to. He therefore that would understand the old Pro<a id="l251"></a>phets (as all Divines ought to do) must fix the significations <a id="l252"></a>of their types &amp; phrases in the beginning of his studies. Some<a id="l253"></a>thing in this kind has been done by former writers: &amp; as I <a id="l254"></a>have endeavoured in the following discourse to carry on the <a id="l255"></a>designe further, so I hope others will bring to it more <a id="l256"></a>perfection. The Rule I have followed has been to compare <a id="l257"></a>the several mystical places of scripture where the same pro<a id="l258"></a>phetick phrase or type is used &amp; to fix such a significa<a id="l259"></a>tion to that phrase as agrees best with all the places: &amp; if  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p11"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> more significations then one be necessary to note the circum<a id="l260"></a>stances by which it may be known in what signification the <a id="l261"></a>phrase is taken in any place: &amp; when I had found the <a id="l262"></a>necessary significations, to reject all others as the ofspring <a id="l263"></a>of luxuriant fansy. ffor no more significations are to be <a id="l264"></a>admitted for true ones then can be proved. And as Criticks <a id="l265"></a>for understanding the Hebrew consult also other oriental <a id="l266"></a>languages of the same  root: so I have not feared <a id="l267"></a>sometimes to call in to my assistance the eastern expo<a id="l268"></a>sitors of their mystical writers (I mean the Chalde Pa<a id="l269"></a>raphrast &amp; the Interpreters of dreams) following herein <a id="l270"></a>the example of M<sup>r</sup> Mede &amp; other late writers. ffor <a id="l271"></a>the language of the Prophets being Hieroglyphical, had <a id="l272"></a>affinity with that of the Egyptian Priests &amp; Eastern wise <a id="l273"></a>men &amp; therefore was anciently much better understood in <a id="l274"></a>the East then it is now in the west. I received also much <a id="l275"></a>light in this search by the analogy between the world na<a id="l276"></a>tural &amp; the world politique. ffor the mystical language <a id="l277"></a>was founded in this analogy &amp; will be best understood by <a id="l278"></a>considering its original. That you may therefore see more <a id="l279"></a>clearly how this analogy stands I shall here give you <a id="l280"></a>a short draught of it as follows before I proceed to the <a id="l281"></a>proof of the particulars.</p>
<p id="par17">1. The whole world natural consisting of heaven <a id="l282"></a>&amp; earth signifies the whole world politique consisting of <a id="l283"></a>thrones &amp; people, or so much of it as is considered <a id="l284"></a>in the prophesy: &amp; the things in that world signify <a id="l285"></a>the analogous things in this. ffor the Heavens  with the <a id="l286"></a>things therein signify thrones &amp; dignities &amp; those that <a id="l287"></a>enjoy them &amp; the earth with the things therein the in<a id="l288"></a>ferior people, &amp; the lowest parts of the Earth called Hades or Hell the lowest &amp; most miserable part of the people. Whence ascending towards heaven &amp; descend<a id="l289"></a>ing to the earth  is put for rising &amp; falling in honour <a id="l290"></a>&amp; power . Rising out of the earth or waters, or falling <a id="l291"></a>into them, for the rising to any dominion or dignity out <a id="l292"></a>of the inferior state of people or falling from the same <a id="l293"></a>into that inferior state. Descending into the lower parts <a id="l294"></a>of the earth called Hades or Hell, for descending to a very <a id="l295"></a>low &amp; unhappy state. Speaking with a faint voice out of the dust for being in a weak &amp; lost condition. Moving from one place to <a id="l296"></a>another for translation from one office dignity or dominion <a id="l297"></a>to another. Great Earthquakes &amp; the shaking of heaven &amp; <a id="l298"></a>earth for the shaking of kingdoms so as to overthrow them. <a id="l299"></a>The creating a heaven &amp; earth &amp; their passing away, or, which  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p12"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> is all one, the beginning &amp; end of the world) for the rise &amp; <a id="l300"></a>ruin of the body politick signified thereby.</p>
<p id="par18">2. Now in heaven the Sun &amp; Moon are by Interpreters of <a id="l301"></a>dreames put for the persons of Kings &amp; Queens, but in sacred <a id="l302"></a>Prophesy which regards not single persons, the Sun is put for <a id="l303"></a>the whole species &amp; race of Kings in the Kingdom or Kingdoms <a id="l304"></a>of the world politick shining with regal power &amp; glory: the <a id="l305"></a>Moon for the body of the common people considered as the Kings <a id="l306"></a>wife: the stars for subordinate Kings Princes &amp; great men <a id="l307"></a>or for Bishops &amp; Rulers of the people of God when the <a id="l308"></a>Sun is Christ: Light for the glory truth &amp; knowledge wherewith <a id="l309"></a>great &amp; good men shine &amp; illuminate others: darkness for ob<a id="l310"></a>scurity of condition &amp; for error &amp; ignorance: darkning, smiting <a id="l311"></a>or setting of the Sun Moon &amp; stars for the ceasing of a kingdom <a id="l312"></a>or for the desolation thereof proportional to the darkness: <a id="l313"></a>darkning the Sun turning the Moon into blood &amp; falling of <a id="l314"></a>the stars for the same. New Moons for the return of <a id="l315"></a>a dispersed people into a body politique or ecclesiastique.</p>
<p id="par19">3 ffire &amp; Meteors refer to both heaven &amp; earth &amp; <a id="l316"></a>signify as follows. Burning any thing by fire is put <a id="l317"></a>for the consumption thereof by war: a conflagration of <a id="l318"></a>the earth or turning a country into a lake of fire <a id="l319"></a>for the consumption of a kingdom by war: the being in a furnace for the being in slavery under another nation: the ascending <a id="l320"></a>up of the smoak of any burning thing for ever &amp; ever <a id="l321"></a>for the continuation of a conquered people under the <a id="l322"></a>misery of perpetual subjection &amp; slavery:  the scorching <a id="l323"></a>heat of the Sun for vexatious wars persecutions &amp; troubles <a id="l324"></a>inflicted by the king. Clouds whether in heaven or on <a id="l325"></a>earth for multitudes of men: Riding on the clouds for <a id="l326"></a>reigning over much people: Covering the Sun with a <a id="l327"></a>cloud or with smoak for oppression of the king by <a id="l328"></a>the armies of an enemy: Tempestuous winds (that is, the motion <a id="l329"></a>of clouds) for wars: Thunder (that is, the voice of a cloud) <a id="l330"></a>for the voice of a multitude: A storm of thunder, or <a id="l331"></a>lightning hail &amp; overflowing rain for a tempest of <a id="l332"></a>war descending from the heavens &amp; clouds politique on the <a id="l333"></a>heads of their enemies: Rain if not immoderate, &amp; <a id="l334"></a>dew &amp; living water for the graces &amp; doctrine of the <a id="l335"></a>spirit: &amp; the defect of rain for spiritual barrenness.</p>
<p id="par20">4. In earth the dry land &amp; congregated waters (as <a id="l336"></a>a Sea, a River, a fflood) are put for the peoples of <a id="l337"></a>several regions nations &amp; dominions: <em class="underline">a wilderness for <a id="l338"></a>a desolate people</em>: embittering of waters for great <a id="l339"></a>affliction of the people by war &amp; persecution: turning  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p13"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> them to blood for the mystical death of bodies politique <a id="l340"></a>that is, for their dissolution. The overflowing of a Sea <a id="l341"></a>or River for the invasion of the earth politique by the <a id="l342"></a>people of the waters. Drying up of waters for the con<a id="l343"></a>quest of their regions by the earth. ffountains of water <a id="l344"></a>for cities the permanent heads of rivers politique. Mountains <a id="l345"></a>&amp; Islands for the cities of the earth &amp; sea politique <a id="l346"></a>with their territories &amp; dominions. Dens &amp; Rocks of <a id="l347"></a>mountains for the Temples of Cities &amp; the hiding of men <a id="l348"></a>in those Dens &amp; Rocks for the shutting up of Idols in <a id="l349"></a>their temples.  Houses &amp; Ships for families <a id="l350"></a>assemblies &amp; towns in the earth &amp; Sea politique: &amp; a Navy <a id="l351"></a>of war-ships for an army of the kingdom signified by <a id="l352"></a>the Sea.</p>
<p id="par21">5. Also Animals Vegetables &amp; Minerals are put for <a id="l353"></a>people of several regions &amp; conditions; &amp; particularly trees <a id="l354"></a>hearbs &amp; land animals for the people of the earth <a id="l355"></a>politique, flaggs reeds &amp; fishes for those of the waters <a id="l356"></a>politique, &amp; birds &amp; insects for those of the politique heaven <a id="l357"></a>&amp; earth, a fforest for a Kingdom, Paradise for a very flourishing &amp; peace<a id="l358"></a>able Kingdom, &amp; Wilderness for a desolate &amp; thin people.</p>
<p id="par22">6. If the world politique considered in Prophesy consists <a id="l359"></a>of many kingdoms, they are represented by as many parts <a id="l360"></a>of the world natural: as the noblest by the celestial <a id="l361"></a>frame, &amp; then the Moon &amp; clouds are put for the <a id="l362"></a>common people; the less noble by the earth sea &amp; rivers <a id="l363"></a>&amp; by the animals or vegetables or buildings therein, &amp; then the <a id="l364"></a>greater &amp; more powerfull animals &amp; taller trees are <a id="l365"></a>put for Kings &amp; Princes. And because the whole king<a id="l366"></a>dom is the body politick of the king, therefore the <a id="l367"></a>Sun or a Tree or a Beast or Bird or Man whereby the <a id="l368"></a>King is represented is put in a large signification <a id="l369"></a>for the whole kingdom, &amp; several animals as a Lion <a id="l370"></a> a Goat a Dragon a Whore a Prophet a Frogg a Cherubin <a id="l371"></a>according to their qualities are put for severall <a id="l372"></a>kingdoms &amp; bodies politique &amp; sacrificing of Beasts for slaughtering &amp; conquering of Kingdoms &amp; friendship between Beasts for peace between kingdoms . Yet sometimes Vegetables &amp; <a id="l373"></a>Animals are by certain epithites or circumstances ex<a id="l374"></a>tended to other significations, as a Tree when called <a id="l375"></a>the tree of life or of knowledge &amp; a Beast when <a id="l376"></a>called the old Serpent or worshipped.</p>

Heaven is represented by the Holy place or main body of the <a id="l451"></a>edifice, the highest heaven by the most Holy or Adytum, the throne of <a id="l452"></a>God by the Ark, the Sun by the bright flame of the fire of the Altar <a id="l453"></a>or by the face of the Son of man shining  through this flame <a id="l454"></a>like the Sun in his strength, the moon by the burning coals upon the <a id="l455"></a>Altar convex above &amp; flat below like an half moon, the starrs <a id="l456"></a>by the lamps, thunder by the song of the Temple,  lightning by <a id="l457"></a>the flashing of the fire of the Altar, the Angels or inhabitants of <a id="l458"></a>heaven by Cherubins carved round the temple, the Sea by the great brazen <a id="l459"></a>laver, the earth by the area of the Courts &amp; the bottomles pit or <a id="l460"></a>lower parts of the earth called Hades &amp; Hell by the sink which ran <a id="l461"></a>down into the earth from the  great Altar &amp; was covered with a <a id="l462"></a>stone to open &amp; shut.

<h2 id="hd7" class="cent">Chap. II <a id="l474"></a><br>The dayly worship described.</h2>
<p id="par28">The Iewish service began every morning with the <a id="l475"></a>sounding of Trumpets, opening of the Temple &amp; killing of <a id="l476"></a>the morning sacrifice together, &amp; dressing of the Lamps <a id="l477"></a>immediately after. The Lamps were drest by the Priests in <a id="l478"></a>their lots &amp; on the fast of the seventh month &amp; seven days <a id="l479"></a>before by the High Priest. And in allusion to this Iohn hears <a id="l480"></a>a great voice as of a Trumpet, &amp; turning to the voice sees one <a id="l481"></a>like the Son of man in the High Priests habit among the <a id="l482"></a>seven branches of the golden candlestick dressing the Lamps <a id="l483"></a>so that they appeared like a rod of seven stars in his <a id="l484"></a>right hand. And his countenance being seen through the <a id="l485"></a>bright flame of the Altar appeared as the Sun shineth <a id="l486"></a>in his strength &amp; his eyes like flames of fire, &amp; his <a id="l487"></a>feet like ambar as if they burned in a furnace. The <a id="l488"></a>Lamps he dresses successively by dictating seven prophetic ex<a id="l489"></a>hortations to the seven Angels of the Churches. For the <a id="l490"></a>seven Angels are represented by the seven stars &amp; seven <a id="l491"></a>lamps &amp; seven eyes of the Lamb &amp; answer to the seven Amarcelim which were  chief Officers <a id="l492"></a>of the Temple next in dignity to the two Catholikim as the Catholikim were next in dignity to the high Priest &amp; his Deputy.. For the seven Amarcelim were Priests <a id="l493"></a>&amp; officers of like &amp; equal honour &amp; authority,  , &amp;  had joyntly <a id="l495"></a>the keys of the seven gates of the Temple, &amp; those also <a id="l496"></a>of the Treasuries, &amp; the direction appointment &amp; oversight <a id="l497"></a>of all things in the Temple. And the seven Angels were <a id="l498"></a>also chief Priests because they came out of the Temple<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> <a id="l499"></a>where none but chief Priests enter, &amp; were cloathed in <a id="l500"></a>pure &amp; white linnen &amp; had their breasts guirded with <a id="l501"></a>golden girdles which is the Priests habit, &amp; at seven sacri<a id="l502"></a>fices poured out seven Vials or drink offerings &amp; sounded <a id="l503"></a>seven trumpets. And as they are Priests so they are said <a id="l504"></a>to be before the throne or Adytum of the Temple &amp; are <a id="l505"></a>considered in the Apocalyps as  having the oversight of all things, being <a id="l507"></a>called<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> the seven eyes of the Lamb, &amp; the seven spirits <a id="l508"></a>of God sent forth into all the earth, that is, the seven <a id="l509"></a>messengers of God. Angels signify messengers &amp; are put in  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p18"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> general for Officers &amp; ministers of the Temple &amp; by conse<a id="l510"></a>quence the seven chief Angels for the seven chief Officers. <a id="l511"></a> <em class="underline">After this</em>, saith Iohn, that is, after the dressing of the Lamps, <a id="l512"></a><em class="underline">I looked &amp; behold a door</em> [the eastern door of the Temple not opening <a id="l513"></a>but already] <em class="underline">opened in heaven, &amp; I heard the first voice as the <a id="l514"></a>voice of a trumpet talking with me &amp; saying, Come up hither <a id="l515"></a>&amp; I will shew thee things which must be hereafter</em>. This voice <a id="l516"></a>being the second sounding of the Trumpet called the Prophet <a id="l517"></a>up to the open door to see the solemnity of the morning sacrifice with such other <a id="l518"></a>visions in the Temple as prefigured things to come. For the <a id="l519"></a>Trumpets sounded every day thrice: first at the opening of the <a id="l520"></a>gates of the Temple, then at the morning &amp; lastly at the evening <a id="l521"></a>sacrifice. In the Epistles to the seven churches Iohn was bid to write things <a id="l522"></a>past present &amp; to come but here he is shewn only things to come &amp; there<a id="l523"></a>fore all interpretations are erroneous which apply any part of the fol<a id="l524"></a>lowing prophesy to things done before the prophesy was written. <em class="underline">And <a id="l525"></a>immediately I was in the spirit &amp; behold a throne was set in heaven <a id="l526"></a>&amp; one sat on the throne</em>. Iohn was in the spirit by the power of the <a id="l527"></a>Angel who was sent to shew him these things &amp; standing at the open door <a id="l528"></a>saw the Adytum of the Temple &amp; God sitting in it above the Ark <a id="l529"></a>between the Cherubims. <em class="underline">And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper <a id="l530"></a>&amp; a sardine stone</em>; that is of an olive colour &amp; complexion like the jasper,  with the ruddy colour of the Sar<a id="l532"></a>dius intermixed; this being the complexion of the natives of Iudea. <a id="l533"></a><em class="underline">And there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto <a id="l534"></a>an Emerald</em>: which implies that the Sun was then in the east or that <a id="l535"></a>it was the time of morning sacrifice. <em class="underline">And round about the throne <a id="l536"></a>were four &amp; twenty seats &amp; upon the seats I saw four &amp; twenty <a id="l537"></a>Elders sitting, cloathed in white raiment; &amp; they had on their heads <a id="l538"></a>crowns of gold</em>. These Elders are the Priests &amp; Levites divided into <a id="l539"></a>24 courses under 24 Princes who had 24 chambers about the <a id="l540"></a>Temple, twelve on one side of the Priests court &amp; twelve on the <a id="l541"></a>other side thereof. Every Elder comprehends in his mystical body <a id="l542"></a>the Prince Priests &amp; Levites of one course. ffor every single per<a id="l543"></a>son in this prophesy is put for a multitude: And every elder has a <a id="l544"></a>viol of incense as a Priest &amp; a harp as a Levite for the musick of <a id="l545"></a>the Temple. <em class="underline">And out of the throne proceeded lightnings &amp; thundrings <a id="l546"></a>&amp; voices</em>. Thundering is the voice of a cloud &amp; a cloud signified a multitude. Iohn standing at the eastern gate of the outward Court <a id="l547"></a>saw the flames of the altar like lightnings &amp; heard the Temple-<a id="l548"></a>music like  thundrings &amp; voices, as if they proceeded out of <a id="l549"></a>the throne. And so when Daniel saw the Ancient of days sitting &amp; his <a id="l550"></a>throne like fiery flames &amp; a fiery stream issuing forth from be<a id="l551"></a>fore him, it may be conceived that Daniel saw him as it were <a id="l552"></a>through the flames of the altar. <em class="underline">And there were seven lamps <a id="l553"></a>of fire burning</em> [in the seven branches of the golden candlestick in the Temple] <em class="underline">before the <a id="l554"></a>throne, which</em> [lamps] <em class="underline">are the seven spirits of God</em>. <em class="underline">And before the <a id="l555"></a>throne</em> [in the Priests' court, between the altar &amp; the Porch of the temple] <a id="l556"></a><em class="underline">there was a sea of glass like unto crystal</em> [the great brazen laver.] <em class="underline">And <a id="l557"></a>in the midst of the throne &amp; circuit of the throne</em>  <a id="l558"></a>that is over against the midst of it &amp; on either hand, <em class="underline">were <a id="l559"></a>four  Animals</em> or Seraphims <em class="underline">full of eyes before and behind</em>, and <a id="l560"></a>also <em class="underline">within</em> or under their wings. These  Animals by their <a id="l561"></a>many eyes signify the people of Israel in the four sides of the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p19"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> outward court, which in Solomons Temple was the peoples court. <a id="l562"></a><em class="underline">And the first was like a Lyon, the second like a calf, the third <a id="l563"></a>had the face of a man &amp; the fourth was like a flying eagle</em>. The <a id="l564"></a>people in the wilderness encamped round the Tabernacle. On <a id="l565"></a>the east were three tribes under the standard of Iudah, on the <a id="l566"></a>west were three tribes under the standard of Epraim, on the <a id="l567"></a>south were three tribes under the standard of Reuben, &amp; on <a id="l568"></a>the north were three tribes under the standard of Dan. Num. 2. <a id="l569"></a>And the standard of Iudah was a Lyon, that of Ephraim an <a id="l570"></a>Ox, that of Reuben a man &amp; that of Dan an eagle as the <a id="l571"></a>Iews affirm. Whence were framed the Hieroglyphicks of <a id="l572"></a>Cherubims &amp; Seraphims to represent the people of Israel, <a id="l573"></a>a Cherubim having one body with the four faces of a <a id="l574"></a>Lyon, Ox, Man &amp; Eagle looking to the four winds of heaven <a id="l575"></a>without turning about &amp; four Seraphims having the same <a id="l576"></a>four faces with four bodies, one face to every body. Con<a id="l577"></a>ceive therefore that the first Beast stands on the east <a id="l578"></a>side of the Temple with the head of a Lyon, the se<a id="l579"></a>cond on the west side with the head of a Calf, the <a id="l580"></a>third on the south side with the head of a Man, &amp; <a id="l581"></a>the fourth on the north side with the head of an <a id="l582"></a>eagle: &amp; that these four signify all the twelve <a id="l583"></a>tribes of Israel, those tribes out of which the hundred <a id="l584"></a>forty &amp; four thousand were sealed, Apoc. 7.4. <em class="underline">And they <a id="l585"></a>had each of them six wings</em>, two wings to a tribe, in all <a id="l586"></a>24.  And these are the four &amp; twenty stations <a id="l589"></a>of the  people of Israel answering to the 24 courses <a id="l590"></a>of the Priests. ffor<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> because the morning &amp; evening sacri<a id="l591"></a>fices were offered for all the people &amp; they whose sa<a id="l592"></a>crifices were offered were obliged to be present in the <a id="l593"></a>Temple, the people had their representatives distinguished <a id="l594"></a>into four &amp; twenty stations or courses to attend each <a id="l595"></a>their week in order, &amp; each station had its President <a id="l596"></a>called the President of the station. <em class="underline">And they rest not <a id="l597"></a>day &amp; night</em> [that is morning &amp; evening at the sacri<a id="l598"></a>fices] <em class="underline">saying Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty which <a id="l599"></a>was &amp; is &amp; is to come</em>. These animals are therefore the <a id="l600"></a>Seraphims which appeared to Isaiah in a vision like this of <a id="l601"></a>the Apocalyps. For there also the Lord sat on a throne <a id="l602"></a>in the Temple &amp; the Seraphims each with six wings cryed <a id="l603"></a>Holy, holy, holy Lord of hosts. <em class="underline">And when those Animals give glory &amp; <a id="l604"></a>honour &amp; thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for <a id="l605"></a>ever &amp; ever, the four &amp; twenty elders fall down before him <a id="l606"></a>that sat on the throne &amp; worship him that liveth for ever <a id="l607"></a>&amp; ever &amp; cast their crowns before the throne saying, Thou</em>  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p20"> &lt;10r&gt; </span><em class="underline">art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory &amp; honour &amp; power: for thou hast cre<a id="l608"></a>ated all things, &amp; for thy pleasure they are &amp; were created</em>. At the morning <a id="l609"></a>&amp; evening sacrifices so soon as the sacrifice was laid upon the Altar, &amp; the drink <a id="l610"></a>offering began to be poured out the trumpets sounded &amp; the Levites sang <a id="l611"></a>by course three times, &amp; every time when the trumpets sounded <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> the <a id="l612"></a>people fell down &amp; worshipped. Three times therefore did the people <a id="l613"></a>worship, to express which number the Beasts cry Holy, holy, holy; &amp; the <a id="l614"></a>song being ended, the people prayed standing till the solemnity was ended, <a id="l615"></a>&amp; in the mean time the Priests <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> went into the Temple &amp; there fell <a id="l616"></a>down  before him that sat on the throne &amp; worshipped.</p>
<p id="par29"><em class="underline">And I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book <a id="l617"></a>written within &amp; on the backside &amp; sealed with seven seales</em>. This alludes to the book <a id="l618"></a>of the Law which was laid up in the most holy place at the right side or south <a id="l619"></a>side of the Ark &amp; so appeared to Iohn as it were in the right hand of him that <a id="l620"></a>sat upon the throne. The book of the Law the Iews distinguish into sections <a id="l621"></a>&amp; call some of these section open others shut up. So the last section of <a id="l622"></a>Genesis wherein Iacob in blessing his sons, predicts the actions captivities <a id="l623"></a>&amp; returns of their posterity &amp; the coming of Shiloh they note for a <a id="l624"></a>section shut up. And in the same sense the songs &amp; prophetic speeches &amp; visions of Moses <a id="l625"></a>&amp; the Prophets &amp; the whole book of the law so far as its ceremonies &amp; festivals are types of <a id="l626"></a>things to come, are shut up &amp;  are considered by the old Prophets as a sealed <a id="l627"></a>Book. So Isaiah:<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> <em class="underline">Bind up the testimony, seal the Law among my disciples</em>. And <a id="l628"></a>again: <em class="underline">the Lord hath poured out upon  you the spirit of deep sleep, &amp; hath <a id="l629"></a>closed your eyes &amp; the Prophets your Rulers hath he covered, &amp; the vision of <a id="l630"></a>all is become as a Book that is sealed which men deliver to one that is <a id="l631"></a>learned saying: Read this I pray thee, &amp; he saith, I cannot for it is sealed</em>. <a id="l632"></a>So Daniel whose visions concern the things prefigured in the Law is bid to <a id="l633"></a>shut up the vision of the Ram &amp; Goat. And in his last vision when the <a id="l634"></a>Angel comes to shew him what is noted in the Scripture of truth he is bid <a id="l635"></a>to shut up the  words &amp; seal the book &amp; told that the words are sealed <a id="l636"></a>till the time of the end, &amp; then knowledge shall be encreased. This book of <a id="l637"></a>the scripture of truth thus sealed  is the book in the right hand of him <a id="l638"></a>that sat upon the throne. For understanding how it was written within &amp; on <a id="l639"></a>the backside &amp; sealed, conceive that the prophesies of the first six seals <a id="l640"></a>being short &amp; single were written on the first six leaves within &amp; that that <a id="l641"></a>of the  times of the seventh seale being long &amp; variously <a id="l642"></a>repeated was written on the seventh leaf within &amp; on the backside &amp; also on <a id="l643"></a>the first page of the eighth leaf, &amp; that the book was composed of these <a id="l644"></a>eight leaves &amp; sealed either with seven seales put in between the leaves or by <a id="l645"></a>tacking every two leaves together by a label &amp; sealing the seven labels, or in <a id="l646"></a>any other manner so that by opening the seales  successively the leaves <a id="l647"></a>might be opened in order. Now this book was of so great consequence that Iohn saith <a id="l648"></a><em class="underline">I saw a strong Angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book <a id="l649"></a>&amp; to loose the seales thereof? And none in heaven nor in earth neither under the <a id="l650"></a>earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon. And I wept much because <a id="l651"></a>no man was found worthy to open &amp; to read the book neither to look thereon. And <a id="l652"></a>one of the Elders said unto me, Weep not: behold the Lion of the tribe of Iudah, <a id="l653"></a>the root of David hath prevailed to open the book &amp; to loose the seven seales thereof <a id="l654"></a>And I beheld, &amp; lo, in the midst  of the  <a id="l655"></a>throne</em> [that is, at the foot of the Altar over against the midst of the throne] <a id="l656"></a><em class="underline">&amp; in the midst of the four  Animals &amp; of the Elders stood a Lamb as it had <a id="l657"></a>been slain</em> [that is, at the morning sacrifice] <em class="underline">&amp; he came &amp; took the book out of the <a id="l658"></a>right hand of him that sat upon the throne</em> All the Priests were allowed to go into the Holy Place to worship, but none were allowed to go into the most Holy besides the high Priest. <em class="underline">And when he had taken the book, the <a id="l659"></a>four Animals &amp; four &amp; twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every <a id="l660"></a>one of them Harps &amp; golden Vials full of odours which are the prayers of the Saints <a id="l661"></a>And they sung a new song saying, Thou art worthy to take the book &amp; open the <a id="l662"></a>Seales thereof: for thou wast slain &amp; hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred &amp; <a id="l663"></a>tongue &amp; people &amp; nation, &amp; hast made us unto our God kings &amp; priests &amp; we shall reign <a id="l664"></a>over the earth</em>. Whence its manifest that the Animals &amp; Elders are Christians of all nations. <a id="l665"></a>And I beheld &amp; I heard the voice of many Angels round about the throne &amp; [round <a id="l666"></a>about the  Animals &amp; the Elders, and the number of them was ten thousand times  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p21"> &lt;11r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">ten thousand &amp; thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice: Worthy is the <a id="l667"></a>Lamb that was slain to receive power &amp; riches &amp; wisdome &amp; strength &amp; <a id="l668"></a>honour &amp; glory &amp; blessing.</em> Because he humbled himself &amp; became obedient  unto <a id="l669"></a>death, even the death of the cross, therefore God hath highly exalted him &amp; <a id="l670"></a>given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Iesus <a id="l671"></a>every knee should bow, of things in heaven &amp; things in earth &amp; things under <a id="l672"></a>the earth; &amp; that every tongue should confess that Iesus Christ is Lord <a id="l673"></a>to the glory of God the Father. <em class="underline">And every creature which is in heaven <a id="l674"></a>&amp; on the earth &amp; under the earth &amp; such as are in the sea &amp; all <a id="l675"></a>that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing &amp; honour &amp; glory &amp; power <a id="l676"></a>be unto him that sitteth upon the throne &amp; unto the Lamb for ever <a id="l677"></a>&amp; ever. And the four Animals said, Amen. And the four &amp; twenty <a id="l678"></a>elders fell down &amp; worshipped him that liveth for ever &amp; ever</em>.</p>
<p id="par30">Thus  have you in these visions the worship described of true Christians,   such as know the Father &amp; <a id="l679"></a>the Son whilst others deny them by worshipping the Beast &amp; his Image. <a id="l680"></a>For the Beast &amp; his Image are in this prophesy opposed to God &amp; Christ, &amp; to worship <a id="l681"></a>the first is to forsake blasphem &amp;  deny the last &amp; go a whoring after other Gods.

<p id="par34">It was the custome for the High Priest seven days before <a id="l711"></a>the ffast of the seventh month to continue constantly in the <a id="l712"></a>Temple &amp; study the book of the Law that he might be perfect <a id="l713"></a>in it against the day of expiration, wherein the service which <a id="l714"></a>was various &amp; intricate was wholy to be performed by <a id="l715"></a>himself, of which service one part was reading the Law <a id="l716"></a>to the people. And to promote his studying it, there were <a id="l717"></a>certain Priests appointed by the Sanedrim to be with him <a id="l718"></a>those seven days in one of his chambers in the Temple <a id="l719"></a>&amp; there to discourse with him about the Law &amp; read it <a id="l720"></a>to him &amp; put him in mind of reading &amp; studying it him <a id="l721"></a>self. And this his opening &amp; reading  the law those seven <a id="l722"></a>days is alluded unto in the Lambs opening the seven seales. <a id="l723"></a>Conceive that the seven days begin in the evening &amp; that the <a id="l724"></a>solemnity of the ffast begins in the morning of the seventh day.</p>
<p id="par35">The seventh seal was therefore opened on the day of Ex<a id="l725"></a>piation &amp; then <em class="underline">there was silence in heaven for half an hour <a id="l726"></a>&amp; an Angel</em> (the high Priest) <em class="underline">stood at the Altar having a <a id="l727"></a>golden censer &amp; there was given him much incense that <a id="l728"></a>he should offer it with the prayers of  all saints upon the <a id="l729"></a>golden Altar which was before the throne</em>. The custome was <a id="l730"></a>on other days for one of the Priests to take fire from the <a id="l731"></a>great Altar in a silver censer, but on this day for the <a id="l732"></a>High Priest to take fire from the great Altar in a Golden <a id="l733"></a>censer, &amp; when he was come down from the great altar <a id="l734"></a>he took incense from one of the Priests that brought it <a id="l735"></a>to him &amp; went with it to the golden Altar, &amp; while he <a id="l736"></a>offered the incense the people prayed without in silence <a id="l737"></a>which is the silence in heaven for half an hour. And when <a id="l738"></a>the High Priest had laid the incense on the Altar he <a id="l739"></a>carried a censer of it burning in his hand into the <a id="l740"></a>most Holy place before the Ark. <em class="underline">And the smoke of the <a id="l741"></a>incense with the prayers of the saints ascended up before <a id="l742"></a>God out of the Angel's hand</em>. On other days there was <a id="l743"></a>a certain measure of incense for the golden Altar: on <a id="l744"></a>this day there was a greater quantity  for both  the Altar <a id="l745"></a>&amp; the most Holy, &amp; therefore it is called <em class="underline">much incense</em> <a id="l746"></a>After this the <em class="underline">Angel took the censer &amp; filled it with <a id="l747"></a>fire of the</em> (great) <em class="underline">Altar &amp; cast it to the earth</em>, that is, <a id="l748"></a>by the hands of the Priests who belong to his mystical body <a id="l749"></a>he cast it to the earth without the Temple for burning <a id="l750"></a>the Goat which was the Lords Lot. And at this &amp; other concomi<a id="l751"></a>tant sacrifices untill the evening sacrifice was ended, <em class="underline">there <a id="l752"></a>were voices &amp; thundrings &amp; lightnings &amp; an earthquake</em>, that <a id="l753"></a>is, the voice of the High Priest reading the Law to the people <a id="l754"></a>&amp; other voices &amp; thundrings of the trumpets &amp; temple-musick <a id="l755"></a>at the sacrifices &amp; lightnings of the fire of the Altar.</p>
<p id="par36">The solemnity of the day of Expiation being finished  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p24"> &lt;13r&gt; </span> the seven Angels sound their Trumpets at the great sacri<a id="l756"></a>fices of the seven days of the feast of Tabernacles, &amp; at the <a id="l757"></a>same sacrifices the seven Thunders utter their voices <a id="l758"></a>which are the Musick of the Temple intermixt with the <a id="l759"></a>soundings of the Trumpets, &amp; the seven Angels pour out <a id="l760"></a>their Viols of wrath which are the drink offerings of those sacrifices.</p>
<p id="par37">Before the Lamb opened the seventh seal &amp; looked <a id="l761"></a>on the prophesy on the inside of the seventh leaf, you are <a id="l762"></a>to conceive that he viewed the synchronal prophesy on <a id="l763"></a>the outside of the same leaf. And upon his viewing it <a id="l764"></a>Iohn saith: <em class="underline">And after these things</em> [that is, after the visions <a id="l765"></a>of the sixt seal] <em class="underline">I saw four Angels standing on the four <a id="l766"></a>corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth, that <a id="l767"></a>the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor <a id="l768"></a>on any tree. And I saw another Angel ascending from the <a id="l769"></a>east having the seal of the living God; &amp; he cried with a <a id="l770"></a>loud voice to the four Angels to whom it was given to <a id="l771"></a>hurt the earth &amp; the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth <a id="l772"></a> neither the sea   nor the trees till we have sealed the servants <a id="l773"></a>of our God in their foreheads</em>. ✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 12v &gt; </span> <em class="underline">of our God in their foreheads</em>. ✝ This sealing alludes to a tradition <a id="l774"></a>of the Iews that upon the day of Expiation all the people of <a id="l775"></a>Israel are sealed up in the books of life &amp; death. <sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> For the <a id="l776"></a>Iews in their Talmud tell us that in the beginning of every <a id="l777"></a>new year or first day of the Month Tisri, three books  <a id="l778"></a><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>are<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> opened in judgment, the book of life in which the names <a id="l779"></a>of those are written who are perfectly just, the book of <a id="l780"></a>death in which the names of those are written who are <a id="l781"></a>atheists or very wicked &amp; a third book of those whose <a id="l782"></a>judgment is suspended till the day of expiation &amp; whose <a id="l783"></a>names are not written in the books of life &amp; death before <a id="l784"></a>that day. The first ten days of this month they call <a id="l785"></a>the penitential days, &amp; all these days they fast &amp; pray <a id="l786"></a>much &amp; are very devout that on the tenth day their <a id="l787"></a>sins may be remitted &amp; their names may be written in the <a id="l788"></a>book of life, which day is therefore called the day of Expi<a id="l789"></a>ation. And upon this tenth day in returning home from their <a id="l790"></a>synagogues they say to one another, <em class="underline">God the creator seal <a id="l791"></a>you to a good year</em>. For they conceive that the books are <a id="l792"></a>now sealed up, &amp; that the sentence of God remains unchanged <a id="l793"></a>henceforward to the end of the year. And the same thing is sig<a id="l794"></a>nified by the two Goats upon whose foreheads the High Priest <a id="l795"></a>yearly in the day of Expiation lays the two lots inscribed. <em class="underline">For <a id="l796"></a>God</em> &amp; <em class="underline">For Azazel</em>, Gods Goat signifying the people who are <a id="l797"></a>sealed  with the name of God in their foreheads.</p>
<p id="par38">The servants of God being therefore sealed in the day <a id="l798"></a>of Expiation, conceive that the four Angels which hold the four <a id="l799"></a>winds were the first four of the seven Angels which stood before God.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 13r resumes &gt; </span> Conceive that  <a id="l801"></a>the four Angels were the first four of the seven Angels <a id="l802"></a>which stood before God &amp; appeared upon opening the seventh seal &amp; that upon <a id="l803"></a>their holding the blustering noisy winds there was silence <a id="l804"></a>in heaven for half an hour, &amp; that  in the time of this silence before the sealing of the servants <a id="l805"></a>of God,  the Angel with the golden censer <a id="l806"></a>offered their prayers with incense upon the golden Altar. <a id="l807"></a>&amp; that so soon as they were sealed the winds hurt the <a id="l808"></a>earth at the sounding of the first Trumpet &amp; the sea <a id="l809"></a>at the sounding of the second, these winds being the wars <a id="l810"></a>of the first four Trumpets. For as the first four seals <a id="l811"></a>are distinguished from the three last by the appearance of <a id="l812"></a>four horsmen towards the four winds of heaven, so <a id="l813"></a>the wars of the first four Trumpets are distinguished from those of the three <a id="l814"></a>last by representing these by the four  winds &amp; the <a id="l815"></a>others by three great Woes. In one of Ezekiel's visions,<sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> <a id="l816"></a>when the Baylonian captivity was at hand, six men appeared with slaughter weapons A man cloathed in linnen with a writer's inkhorn by his <a id="l817"></a>side, is commanded to go through the midst of Ierusalem, <a id="l818"></a>&amp; set a mark upon the foreheads of the men who sigh <a id="l819"></a>&amp; cry for all the abominations done in the midst thereof, <a id="l820"></a>&amp; then  other six men (like the Angels of the first <a id="l821"></a>six Trumpets) are commanded to slay those who are <a id="l822"></a>not marked, &amp; after them the man cloathed in linnen <a id="l823"></a>(a seventh) scatters over the city coals of fire to con<a id="l824"></a>sume it. These visions have relation to one another, &amp; the six <a id="l825"></a>first men with the slaughter weapons answer to the six first <a id="l826"></a>Angels with the trumpets &amp; the seventh man with the writers <a id="l827"></a>inkhorn to the seventh Angel. Whence it may be understood <a id="l828"></a>that the Angel who ascended from the east with the seal of <a id="l829"></a>the living God, was the seventh Angel, &amp; that the servants <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p25"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> of God whom he sealed continued till he was ready to sound, &amp;  kept <a id="l830"></a>the feast of tabernacles &amp; then  by the <a id="l831"></a>preaching of the everlasting Gospel grew into an innume<a id="l832"></a>rable multitude of all nations &amp; on the seventh day of the <a id="l833"></a>feast or at the sounding of the seventh trumpet, kept the <a id="l834"></a>solemnity of the great Hosannah; coming out of the great <a id="l835"></a>tribulation with palm branches in their hands &amp; crying, Sal<a id="l836"></a>vation (that is Hosannah) to our God. For the solemnity of the <a id="l837"></a>great Hosannah was kept upon the seventh day the great <a id="l838"></a>day of the ffeast, &amp; the carrying of palm-branches &amp; crying Hosannah <a id="l839"></a>are symbols of a great victory, that victory by which at the sound<a id="l840"></a>ing of the seventh trumpet the mystery of God is finished &amp; <a id="l841"></a>the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our Lord <a id="l842"></a>&amp; his Christ who reign for ever &amp; ever.

<p id="par39">After six  of the Angels answering to the six men with <a id="l861"></a>slaughter weapons, had sounded their Trumpets; the Lamb  in the <a id="l863"></a>form of <em class="underline">a mighty Angel came down from heaven cloathed <a id="l864"></a>with a cloud &amp; a rainbow upon his head &amp; his face was as it <a id="l865"></a>were the Sun &amp; his feet as pillars of fire</em> [the shape in which <a id="l866"></a>Christ appeared in the beginning of this prophesy] <em class="underline">&amp; he had in <a id="l867"></a>his hand a little book open</em>, the book which he had newly opened. <a id="l868"></a>ffor he received but one book from him that sitteth upon the <a id="l869"></a>throne, &amp; he alone was worthy to open &amp; look on this book.

This is an introduction to a new prophesy,  to a <a id="l922"></a>repetition of the prophesy of the whole book, &amp; alludes to Eze<a id="l923"></a>kiel's eating a  roll or book spread open before him &amp; written <a id="l924"></a>within &amp; without &amp; full of lamentations &amp; mourning &amp; wo, <a id="l925"></a>but sweet in his mouth. Eating &amp; drinking signify acquiring &amp; <a id="l926"></a>possessing.

The visions being <a id="l1039"></a>in the Temple, the candlesticks must be conceived to resemble <a id="l1040"></a>the candlesticks in the Temple. In the Tabernacle there was one <a id="l1041"></a>golden candlestick with seven branches &amp; seven lamps upon the <a id="l1042"></a>branches, &amp; in the Temple of Solomon there were ten such can<a id="l1043"></a>dlesticks; but in the Apocalyps there were but seven lamps &amp; <a id="l1044"></a>therefore but one candlestick with seven branches, which branches <a id="l1045"></a>are called the seven golden candlesticks. One branch was in the <a id="l1046"></a>middle &amp; three on either side (Exod. 25.32) &amp; thereby the <a id="l1047"></a>lamps were in a right line so as to appear to Iohn like <a id="l1048"></a>a rod of seven stars in the right hand of the Son of Man. The <a id="l1049"></a>seven candlesticks signify seven churches &amp; all seven are <a id="l1050"></a>but one sevenfold Church &amp; so are most fitly represented <a id="l1051"></a>by one sevenfold candlestick. The seven lamps enlighten <a id="l1052"></a>the Temple, &amp; the Temple represents the Church catholick. <a id="l1053"></a>These lamps are the seven spirits of God (Apoc. 4.5) &amp; the <a id="l1054"></a>seven spirits are sent forth into all the earth (Apoc. 5.6.) <a id="l1055"></a>&amp; Zech 4.10) &amp; therefore the lamps are the light of the <a id="l1056"></a>Church catholick &amp; the sevenfold candlestick is a symbol <a id="l1057"></a>of the Church catholick. And the same thing is signified by <a id="l1058"></a>the Lamb with his seven horns &amp; seven eyes. His mystical <a id="l1059"></a>body is the Church catholick, his eyes are the seven spirits <a id="l1060"></a>of God &amp; his horns the seven churches. Before the writing <a id="l1061"></a>of this Prophesy the light of the gospel came to all nations from <a id="l1062"></a>Ierusalem. Vpon the Iewish war the Apostles with the Church <a id="l1063"></a>of Ierusalem fled from that city &amp; Christ by the seven epistles <a id="l1064"></a>instructed the seven Churches of Asia that they might in<a id="l1065"></a>struct others, &amp; dressed their lamps that they might shine bright, <a id="l1066"></a>&amp; Iohn presiding there long after the death of the  rest of the <a id="l1067"></a>Apostles &amp; instructing them left a race of disciples which made <a id="l1068"></a>those churches the great light of the Church catholick in <a id="l1069"></a>the first ages of the Christian religion untill the Woman  <a id="l1070"></a>(with an outward form of Church government) fled from the <a id="l1071"></a>Temple into the wilderness &amp; ceased to be illuminated any <a id="l1072"></a>longer by the light of these lamps. And then in allusion to <a id="l1073"></a>the times of the Babylonian captivity a second Temple <a id="l1074"></a>is built for the worship of those who remain in Iudea <a id="l1075"></a>&amp; in the holy City now troden under foot by the Babylo<a id="l1076"></a>nian Gentiles: &amp; the outward court of this Temple is <a id="l1077"></a>left open &amp; unbuilt &amp; given to those Gentiles.</p>
<p id="par42">In the second Temple there was a Candlestick with <a id="l1078"></a>seven lamps whose form is thus described in the visions of <a id="l1079"></a>Zechary ch 4. The lamps were joyned to a golden bowle <a id="l1080"></a>by seven golden pipes through which the oyle ran into them <a id="l1081"></a>&amp; the bowle stood upon a golden candlestick &amp; was joyned <a id="l1082"></a>to two vessels of oyle on either side by two golden pipes through <a id="l1083"></a>which the oyle ran into it, &amp; the two vessels were supported by <a id="l1084"></a>two Olive trees, not living trees growing upon a root &amp; flourishing <a id="l1085"></a>with branches &amp; leaves, but shafts of Olive wood. These two <a id="l1086"></a>Olive trees &amp; this candlestick (suppose with two branches) <a id="l1087"></a>are alluded unto in the Apocalyps, the name of candlestick <a id="l1088"></a>which in the old Testament is given to the stem with all its <a id="l1089"></a>branches, being in this Prophesy given to each of the branches. <a id="l1090"></a>Now Candlesticks signify churches as above &amp; so do Olive trees Rom. 11.17, 24. <a id="l1091"></a>&amp; since the two Candlesticks support the golden bowle with all the seven <a id="l1092"></a>lamps, &amp; the two Olive trees supply them with oyle for illuminating the <a id="l1093"></a>whole Temple of God, they must represent the whole Church of God distin- </p>

<p id="par43" class="i0">describes in the second Temple. Zech. 4. The visions being in <a id="l1094"></a>the Temple, the candlesticks must be conceived to resemble the <a id="l1095"></a>candlesticks in the Temple. In the Tabernacle there was one golden <a id="l1096"></a>candlestick with seven branches &amp; seven lamps upon the branches &amp; <a id="l1097"></a>in the temple of Solomon there were ten such candlesticks, but in <a id="l1098"></a>the Apocalyps there were but seven lamps &amp; therefore but one <a id="l1099"></a>candlestick with seven branches, which branches are called the seven <a id="l1100"></a>golden candlesticks. One branch was in the middle &amp; three on either <a id="l1101"></a>side (Exod 25.32) &amp; thereby the lamps were in a right line so <a id="l1102"></a>as to appear to Iohn like a rod of seven stars in the right <a id="l1103"></a>hand of the son of man. The seven Candlesticks signify seven <a id="l1104"></a>churches &amp; all seven are but one sevenfold Church &amp; so are <a id="l1105"></a>most fitly represented by one sevenfold candlestick. The seven <a id="l1106"></a>Lamps enlighten the Temple &amp; the Temple represents the <a id="l1107"></a>Church catholick. These lamps are the seven spirits of <a id="l1108"></a>God (Apoc. 4.5) &amp; the seven spirits are sent forth into <a id="l1109"></a>all the earth (Apoc. 5.6 &amp; Zech 4.10) &amp; therefore the lamps <a id="l1110"></a>are the light of the Church catholick &amp; the sevenfold <a id="l1111"></a>candlestick is a symbol of the Church catholick.  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 17v &gt; </span><em class="underline">These have power</em>, like Elijah &amp; Elisha in the reign of Iezabel, <em class="underline">to shut heaven <a id="l1128"></a>that it rain not in the days of their prophesy</em>. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 17Ar resumes &gt; </span>And the same thing is signifyed by the Lamb with his seven <a id="l1129"></a>horns &amp; seven eyes. His mystical body is the Church catholick, <a id="l1130"></a>his eyes are the seven spirits of God &amp; his horns the seven <a id="l1131"></a>churches.</p>
<p id="par44">Now this vision of the sevenfold candlestick &amp; of the Lamb <a id="l1132"></a>with seven horns continues while the Lamb is opening the seven <a id="l1133"></a>seals: but upon opening the seventh seal the Lamb changes <a id="l1134"></a>his shape &amp; appears in the form of the high Priest with a <a id="l1135"></a>golden censer to offer the prayers of the saints upon the <a id="l1136"></a>golden altar. I say he changes his shape: for he never <a id="l1137"></a>appears in two shapes at once. And at the same time, instead <a id="l1138"></a>of the seven candlesticks of gold there are two Candlesticks <a id="l1139"></a>of olive tree. And hence forward the Church catholick is re<a id="l1140"></a>presented by the mystical body of Christ in the form of an high  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p33"> &lt;17Br&gt; </span> Priest with his leggs burning as it were in a furnace by reason of the perse<a id="l1141"></a>cutions, &amp; by two candlesticks called Olive trees in allusion to the vision <a id="l1142"></a>of Zechary. In that vision the seven lamps were joyned to a golden <a id="l1143"></a>bowle by seven golden pipes through which the oyle ran into them, &amp; <a id="l1144"></a>the bowle stood upon a golden candlestick &amp; was joyned to two <a id="l1145"></a>vessels of oyle on either side by two golden pipes though which the oyle <a id="l1146"></a>ran into it, &amp; the two vessels were supported by two olive trees, <a id="l1147"></a>not living trees growing upon a root &amp; flourishing with branches &amp; <a id="l1148"></a>leaves, but shafts of olive wood. In the Apocalyps the two olive <a id="l1149"></a>trees are called two candlesticks, &amp; therefore you  may conceive <a id="l1150"></a>that in the visions as they appeared to Iohn, the whole golden <a id="l1151"></a>frame of the lamps &amp; bowle &amp; two vessels of oyle are supported <a id="l1152"></a>by two candlesticks of olive tree standing under the two vessels <a id="l1153"></a>of oyle, without the golden candlestick under the bowle, there being <a id="l1154"></a>no mention of this golden candlestick in the visions of Iohn.</p>
<p id="par45">Christ threatened to remove the Candlestick of Ephesus out of its <a id="l1155"></a>place &amp; to spew the Church of Laodicea out of his mouth. These being <a id="l1156"></a>two branches of the sevenfold golden candlestick, were not to be removed alone <a id="l1157"></a>Conceive therefore that at the opening of the seventh seale, when <a id="l1158"></a>the Lamb with seven horns changes his shape into that of the high <a id="l1159"></a>Priest or Angel standing at the golden altar &amp; as it were on the <a id="l1160"></a>earth &amp; sea, the sevenfold golden candlestick is removed &amp; the <a id="l1161"></a>two candlesticks of olive wood come into its place; &amp; that the <a id="l1162"></a>Angel continues standing with right foot on the earth &amp; his left foot on the <a id="l1163"></a>sea all the time of this vision of the two candlesticks of olive <a id="l1164"></a>wood supporting the seven lamps: &amp; that the Church catholick <a id="l1165"></a>which had been hitherto represented by the sevenfold golden <a id="l1166"></a>candlestick &amp; by the mystical body of Christ in the form of a <a id="l1167"></a>Lamb with seven horns is henceforward represented by the two <a id="l1168"></a>candlesticks of olive wood &amp; by the mystical body of Christ standing <a id="l1169"></a>with his right foot on the earth &amp; his left foot on the sea. ffor <a id="l1170"></a>Candlesticks signify Churches, &amp; the two candlesticks which support <a id="l1171"></a>all the seven lamps can signify nothing less then the Church <a id="l1172"></a>catholick. As Nebuchadnezzars image by its ten toes represented <a id="l1173"></a>the division of the fourth monarchy into ten kingdoms: : so Christ by his two leggs standing <a id="l1175"></a>on the earth &amp; sea represents the Church catholick seated in the <a id="l1176"></a>two empires of the earth &amp; sea, &amp; these are the two Candlesticks &amp; <a id="l1177"></a>the two Witnesses which prophesy in the times of the seventh seale.</p>

And the same distinction was re<a id="l1200"></a>presented by the son of Man appearing in the beginning of the <a id="l1201"></a>Prophesy with two flaming eyes &amp; two feet burning as it were in <a id="l1202"></a>a furnace. His mystical body represents the Church catholick &amp; his <a id="l1203"></a>eyes &amp; leggs denote the division of this Church into two parts, the churches <a id="l1204"></a>of the  earth &amp; Sea For afterwards when the Son of man in the form of <a id="l1206"></a>an Angel comes down from heaven with feet as pillars of fire  he <a id="l1207"></a>sets his right foot upon the sea &amp; his left foot upon the earth <a id="l1208"></a>.

<h2 id="hd9" class="cent">Chap.  IV. <a id="l1261"></a><br>The Prophesy of the eaten Book <a id="l1262"></a>described.</h2>
<p id="par50">As several visions in Daniel have interpretations annexed to them <a id="l1263"></a>so hath Iohn's prophesy of the seales &amp; trumpets, &amp; this interpretation is <a id="l1264"></a>a repetition of the prophesy of the whole book in the same order as <a id="l1265"></a>before &amp; in a manner more full &amp; sensible,  as is signified by Iohn's <a id="l1266"></a>eating  &amp; digesting the book &amp; thereby becoming inspired with the <a id="l1267"></a>whole prophesy anew more  intimately &amp; perfectly then before when <a id="l1268"></a>he only saw the book at a distance: The repetition begins thus.</p>
<p id="par51"><em class="underline">And the Temple of God was opened in heaven &amp; there was <a id="l1269"></a>seen in his Temple the Ark of his testament</em>. As the former <a id="l1270"></a>prophesy began with a door opened in heaven so doth this There Iohn saw a throne set in heaven &amp; God sitting upon it here he sees in the Temple the Ark of the Testament which is God's throne.  This Temple was the first temple, or if you please the <a id="l1272"></a>temple of the tabernacle  as it is afterwards called, that is <a id="l1273"></a>the tabernacle &amp; first temple together. ffor the second temple had <a id="l1274"></a>no Ark.</p>
<p id="par52"><em class="underline">And there were lightnings &amp; voices &amp; thunderings &amp; an <a id="l1275"></a>earthquake &amp; great hail</em>: a short representation of the <a id="l1276"></a>wars of the four horsmen which appeared at opening the first <a id="l1277"></a>four seals.</p>
<p id="par53"><em class="underline">And there appeared a great wonder in</em> [the Temple of] <a id="l1278"></a><em class="underline">heaven, a woman cloathed with the Sun &amp; the Moon under <a id="l1279"></a>her feet</em>. Conceive her appearing through the bright flame of the <a id="l1280"></a>Altar with her feet upon the burning coals of the altar as upon <a id="l1281"></a>an half moon, <em class="underline">and upon her head a crown of twelve stars</em> re<a id="l1282"></a>presenting the twelve Apostles. She is therefore the church from <a id="l1283"></a>the days of the twelve Apostles: for her seed keep the command<a id="l1284"></a>ments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus. The Church catholick which was before represented by a golden candlestick with seven branches is now represented by this Woman.</p>
<p id="par54"><em class="underline">And she being with child cried travelling in birth &amp; pained <a id="l1285"></a>to be delivered</em>: which came to pass at the opening of the fift seal <a id="l1286"></a>by the great persecution there described</p>
<p id="par55"><em class="underline">And there appeared another wonder in heaven, &amp; behold a <a id="l1287"></a>great red Dragon</em> [the Roman heathen Empire] <em class="underline">having seven heads <a id="l1288"></a>&amp; ten horns &amp; seven crowns upon this heads</em>. This Dragon being <a id="l1289"></a>the old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan, is that Devil who <a id="l1290"></a>hath his seat in Pergamus, that is the Greek empire in the reign <a id="l1291"></a>of the last horn of Daniel's He Goat, which horn was mighty <a id="l1292"></a>but not in his own power but in the power of the Romans <a id="l1293"></a>as was shewed above. His heads being crowned are seven kings <a id="l1294"></a>or dynasties of kings or successive reigns, such as the kingdom <a id="l1295"></a>was distinguished into by the opening of the seven seales. <a id="l1296"></a>For the first four of these reigns are represented by four horsmen <a id="l1297"></a>with armies &amp; standards &amp; a crown is given to the first  <a id="l1298"></a>horsman to shew that he is a king, &amp; it is to be conceived that all the <a id="l1299"></a>seven are of a kind. The reign of the Dragon therefore so far <a id="l1300"></a>as it is considered in this prophesy begins with the opening of <a id="l1301"></a>the first seale.</p>
<p id="par56"><em class="underline">And the great Dragon was cast out</em> [of heaven] — <em class="underline">&amp; his Angels</em>  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p38"> &lt;20r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">were cast out with him</em>, as is represented by the smiting of the <a id="l1302"></a>sun moon &amp; stars &amp; the passing away of heaven at the open<a id="l1303"></a>ing of the sixt seale. He was cast out of the Temple above into the Peoples court.</p>
<p id="par57">‡ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 19v &gt; </span>‡ And <em class="underline">he came down to the inhabiters of the earth &amp; sea</em>, the earth &amp; sea which <a id="l1304"></a>were hurt at the sounding of the two first Trumpets, the earth &amp; sea upon which <a id="l1305"></a>the son of man in the form of an Angel set his  left foot &amp; his right. To reign over the nations of this earth <a id="l1306"></a>&amp; sea the Dragon came down with great wrath, And <em class="underline">he persecuted the Woman <a id="l1307"></a>which brought forth the Man-child, &amp; to the Woman were given two wings of <a id="l1308"></a>a great Eagle</em>. The  great eagle denotes the Roman Empire &amp; by the <a id="l1309"></a>division of this Empire into the Empires of the earth &amp; sea or Greeks &amp; <a id="l1310"></a>Latines, the Woman or Church catholick diffused through this Empire, re<a id="l1311"></a>ceives two wings of a great Eagle.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 20r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par58"><em class="underline">And the woman fled into the wilderness</em>, &amp; left in the Temple a <em class="underline">remnant <a id="l1312"></a>of her seed who keep the commandments of God &amp; have the testi<a id="l1313"></a>mony of Iesus Christ</em>. Conceive that this division of the Church <a id="l1314"></a>into the woman  &amp; the remnant of her seed was made at the <a id="l1315"></a>opening of the seventh seale when   144000 were numbered &amp; sealed <a id="l1316"></a>out of all the twelve tribes of Israel &amp; the sevenfold candlestick was removed out of the temple: &amp; that Iohn saw the woman <a id="l1317"></a>flying from the Dragon &amp; from the Temple through the wilderness or desert of Arabia <a id="l1318"></a>to the city Babylon seated on the many waters of Eufrates where <a id="l1319"></a>she commits spiritual fornication with the great men of Babylon <a id="l1320"></a>in worshipping Dæmons or dead mens souls &amp; images of metal wood &amp; stone <a id="l1321"></a>which can neither hear nor see nor walk.</p>
<p id="par59">✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 19v &gt; </span>✝ About the same time that the woman fled there arose up two Beasts one out <a id="l1322"></a>of the sea the other out of the earth. The first Beast had seven heads &amp; a <a id="l1323"></a>mortal wound in one of them &amp; his wound was healed &amp; he revived before he <a id="l1324"></a>arose. And in allusion to the custome of the Heathens of deifying &amp; worshipping their <a id="l1325"></a>kings after death &amp; erecting Temples &amp; Images &amp; sometimes Oracles to them &amp; marking their <a id="l1326"></a>worshippers: the second Beast acts the part of a Priest &amp; <em class="underline">maketh</em> or createth <em class="underline">all the power of <a id="l1327"></a>the first Beast before him</em>, that is, he deifies this Hero, this Man of sin &amp; makes him <a id="l1328"></a>of divine authority among the people. And <em class="underline">he causeth the earth &amp; them that dwell therein <a id="l1329"></a>to worship this first Beast whose deadly wound was healed</em>.  And <em class="underline">he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men</em> for sacrificing the saints on his altars.  And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by fals miracles saying <em class="underline">that they should make an Image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword &amp; revived.</em> And  he <em class="underline">gave breath to the Image</em> that the <a id="l1333"></a><em class="underline">Image shold both speak</em> like one of the  ancient heathen Oracles, <em class="underline">&amp;</em> [by dictating] <em class="underline">cause <a id="l1334"></a>that as may as would not worship the Image should be killed. And he causeth all <a id="l1335"></a>both small &amp; great, rich &amp; poor, free &amp; bond to receive a mark in their right hand or <a id="l1336"></a>in their foreheads</em>, that is all who are not at the same time sealed with the seale of <a id="l1337"></a>the living God. For <em class="underline">all that dwell upon the earth worship this beast whose names are <a id="l1338"></a>not written in the book of life</em>, that is all who are not sealed. And after this marking  Iohn <em class="underline">looked &amp; lo a Lamb stood on mount Sion &amp; with him an hundred &amp; forty four thousand having his name &amp; his fathers name <a id="l1340"></a>written in their foreheads</em>. Conceive that between the opening of the seventh seal &amp; <a id="l1341"></a>sounding of the  first Trumpet the people represented by the twelve tribes of Israel became <a id="l1342"></a>divided into two parties one of which being very small was numbered &amp; sealed <a id="l1343"></a>with the seale of God the other being very great &amp; universal was marked <a id="l1344"></a>with the mark of the Beast &amp; that so soon as this sealing &amp; marking was <a id="l1345"></a>finished, that is, at or a little before the sounding of the first Trumpet, the Lamb stood on mount <a id="l1346"></a>Sion with the 144 thousand who were newly sealed.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 20r resumes &gt; </span>

<p id="par61">This marking &amp; sealing alludes to a custome of the heathens <a id="l1357"></a>of marking servants with the mark or name of their masters <a id="l1358"></a>souldiers with the mark or name of their king &amp; worshippers <a id="l1359"></a>of a God with the mark or name of the God, as by marking <a id="l1360"></a>the worshippers of Bacchus with the figure of an ivy leaf <a id="l1361"></a>or with any of the names of Bacchus or with the number made <a id="l1362"></a>up of the numeral letters of his name. And such marks or <a id="l1363"></a>names or numbers were usually set upon the forehead or <a id="l1364"></a>neck or right hand or arm or breast of the person marked <a id="l1365"></a>&amp; were made sometimes by burning &amp; sometimes by pricking <a id="l1366"></a>&amp; colouring the flesh. So Lucian tells us that <em class="underline">all the wor<a id="l1367"></a>shippers of the Dea Syria were marked some in the palm <a id="l1368"></a>of their hand others in their neck &amp; that from thence it came to pass that all <a id="l1369"></a>the Assyrians appeared with marks upon them</em>, that is all <a id="l1370"></a>those whom he there calls Assyrians, including the Syrians &amp; <a id="l1371"></a>Babylonians. And this custome was very ancient being interdicted <a id="l1372"></a>by Moses: <em class="underline">Ye shall not print any mark upon you I am the Lord your God</em> Levit. 19.28.</p>
<p id="par62">In the solemnity of the  ffast of the seventh month <a id="l1373"></a>the attonement for the sins of the people was made by two Goats <a id="l1374"></a>the one God's lot, the other Azazel's that is the Devil's. Which of <a id="l1375"></a>the two Goats should be God's was determined by lot. The lots were <a id="l1376"></a>of gold one with the inscription <em class="underline">For God</em>, the other with the inscrip<a id="l1377"></a>tion  <em class="underline">For Azazel</em>. These lots were put into a box &amp; shaken &amp; <a id="l1378"></a>the High Priest, one of the Goats being set at his right hand &amp; the <a id="l1379"></a>other at his left, put both his hands together into the box, took <a id="l1380"></a>out the lots, &amp; laid the right hand lot on the head of the right <a id="l1381"></a>hand Goat &amp; the left hand lot on the head of the left hand Goat <a id="l1382"></a>And then Gods lot was sacrificed as a sin offering to cleanse the <a id="l1383"></a>sanctuary from the sins of the people, &amp; Azazel's lot had the <a id="l1384"></a>sins of the people confest over him &amp; put upon his head, &amp; so loaden  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p39"> &lt;21r&gt; </span>  with their sins was let go into the wilderness. Thus by these two <a id="l1385"></a>Goats was signified a separation of the people into two parties with the <a id="l1386"></a>names of God &amp; Azazel upon their foreheads. And in allusion to this <a id="l1387"></a>ceremony there are numbered &amp; sealed with the name of God on their foreheads an hundred <a id="l1388"></a>forty &amp; four thousand out of the twelve tribes of Israel &amp; the rest are <a id="l1389"></a>marked with the mark or name of the Beast. And the glorious woman in heaven <a id="l1390"></a>who signifies the church of God or twelve tribes of Israel separated from a remnant of her seed becomes loaden <a id="l1391"></a>with sins &amp; flys into the wilderness with a name on her forehead, <a id="l1392"></a><em class="underline">Mystery, Babylon the great the mother of harlots &amp; abominations of <a id="l1393"></a>the earth</em>: &amp; the remnant of her seed keep the commandments of God &amp; <a id="l1394"></a>have the testimony of Iesus &amp; the name of God is on their forehead &amp; they <a id="l1395"></a>are mystically killed or sacrificed for not worshipping the Image of the <a id="l1396"></a>Beast, being the first fruits unto God in respect of the following harvest.</p>
<p id="par63"><em class="underline">And I heard a voice from</em> [the temple of] <em class="underline">heaven as the voice of <a id="l1397"></a>many waters</em> [or much people] <em class="underline">&amp; as the voice of a great thunder; &amp; I <a id="l1398"></a>heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: &amp; they sing as <a id="l1399"></a>it were a new song before the throne &amp; before the four Beasts &amp; the <a id="l1400"></a>elders</em> [&amp; by consequence in the  Tem<a id="l1401"></a>ple]  <em class="underline">&amp; no man could learn that <a id="l1402"></a>song but the hundred &amp; forty four thousand</em>. A new song denotes a new state of things &amp; singing is prophesying.

You may conceive also that the 144000 continue  <a id="l1409"></a>on mount Sion with the Lamb &amp; sing at the sacrifices of the first six days of the feast of tabernacles &amp; that no man else could <a id="l1410"></a>learn their song because all others worship the Beast. Con<a id="l1411"></a>ceive also that in some considerable part of this time the <a id="l1412"></a>Gentiles tread down the holy city 42 months, the two <a id="l1413"></a>witnesses prophesy in sackcloth 1260 days, the woman is <a id="l1414"></a>fed in the wilderness 1260 days &amp; a time times &amp; half a <a id="l1415"></a>time &amp; the Beast speaks great things &amp; blasphemies 42 months <a id="l1416"></a>ffor all these things are of a length &amp;  agree <a id="l1417"></a>in the nature of the things &amp; therefore are coincident to one another &amp; make but one period <a id="l1418"></a>of time</p>
<p id="par64"><em class="underline">These are they which were not defiled with weomen; for they are <a id="l1419"></a>Virgins</em>. opposed to them who committ fornication with the great <a id="l1420"></a>whore. <em class="underline">These are they which follow the Lamb whethersoever he goeth</em>, <a id="l1421"></a>in obeying his commandments, while all the rest wonder after the Beast <a id="l1422"></a><em class="underline">These were redeemed from among men being the first fruits unto God <a id="l1423"></a>&amp; to the Lamb</em> with respect to the following harvest. <em class="underline">And in their <a id="l1424"></a>mouth was found no lye</em> as in the mouth of the ffals Prophet: for they are true  witnesses &amp; have the <a id="l1425"></a>testimony of Iesus, &amp; their song is a true prophesy, the prophesy of the <a id="l1426"></a>two Witnesses.</p>
<p id="par65"><em class="underline">And</em>  <em class="underline">I saw an Angel fly in the midst of heaven having the <a id="l1428"></a>everlasting Gospel</em> [the scripture of truth now opened by the event of things] <a id="l1429"></a><em class="underline">to preach  unto them that dwell on the earth even to every nation &amp; <a id="l1430"></a>kindred &amp; tongue &amp; people; saying with a loud voice, Fear God &amp; give <a id="l1431"></a>glory to him for the hour of his judgement is come and</em> [instead of <a id="l1432"></a>the Beast &amp; his Image] <em class="underline">worship him who made heaven &amp; earth &amp; the <a id="l1433"></a>sea &amp; the fountains of waters.  And there followed another Angel <a id="l1434"></a>saying Babylon the great is fallen is fallen, because she made all nations <a id="l1435"></a>drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication</em>. Conceive that when <a id="l1436"></a>the times of the great Apostacy or first six Trumpets are expiring  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p40"> &lt;22r&gt; </span> the hundred &amp; forty four thousand by the preaching of the everlasting gos<a id="l1437"></a>pel &amp; the double fall of Babylon become an innumerable multitude of all nations.</p>
<p id="par66"><em class="underline">And a third Angel followed them saying with a loud voice, If any man <a id="l1438"></a>worship the Beast &amp; his Image &amp; receive his mark in his forehead or in <a id="l1439"></a>his hand</em> [viz<sup>t</sup> in the time of the great tribulation or last persecution of the <a id="l1440"></a>innumerable multitude] <em class="underline">the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath <a id="l1441"></a>of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation <a id="l1442"></a>&amp; he shall be tormented with fire &amp; brimstone in the presence of the holy <a id="l1443"></a>Angels &amp; in the presence of the Lamb</em>. - <em class="underline">Here is the patience of the saints <a id="l1444"></a>here are they that keep the commandments of God &amp; the faith of Iesus. <a id="l1445"></a>And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the <a id="l1446"></a>dead which dye in the Lord from henceforth: yea saith the spirit that <a id="l1447"></a>they may rest from their labours &amp; their works do follow them</em>. All <a id="l1448"></a>this is introductory to the great tribulation &amp; now follows the tribulation it <a id="l1449"></a>self. <em class="underline">And I looked &amp; behold a white cloud &amp; upon the cloud one sat like <a id="l1450"></a>the son of man having on his head a golden crown &amp; in his hand a sharp <a id="l1451"></a>sickle. And another Angel came out of the Temple crying with a loud voice <a id="l1452"></a>to him that sat on the cloud: Thrust in thy sickle &amp; reap for the harvest <a id="l1453"></a>of the earth is ripe. And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on <a id="l1454"></a>the earth &amp; the earth was reaped</em>. Conceive this harvest to be of the <a id="l1455"></a>martyrs in the great tribulation. In the persecution described at the <a id="l1456"></a>opening of the fift seale the martyrs who lay slain at the foot of the <a id="l1457"></a>altar, cried with a loud voice saying; How long, O Lord, holy &amp; true dost <a id="l1458"></a>thou not judge &amp; avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth <a id="l1459"></a>&amp; it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season <a id="l1460"></a>untill their fellow servants also &amp; their brethren that should be killed <a id="l1461"></a>as they were should be fulfilled. A little season &amp; a short space <a id="l1462"></a>are in this prophesy phrases for the duration of the great Apostacy <a id="l1463"></a>as where 'tis said that the Dragon hath great wrath knowing that he <a id="l1464"></a>hath but a short time and that the seventh head of the Beast must <a id="l1465"></a>continue a short space. The martyrs were to rest during this little season <a id="l1466"></a>in the end of which there was to be another great persecution which Daniel <a id="l1467"></a>calls a time of trouble such as there never was since there was a nation <a id="l1468"></a>&amp; Christ in Matthew's Gospel a great tribulation such as was not since <a id="l1469"></a>the beginning of the world &amp; in the Apocalyps 'tis called the great tribu<a id="l1470"></a>lation out of which the Palmbearing multitude comes &amp; the harvest of the <a id="l1471"></a>earth which Christ reaps with a sharp sickle. In this persecution the bre<a id="l1472"></a>thren of the martyrs were to be killed as they had been in Dioclesians <a id="l1473"></a>persecution, &amp; so soon as this harvest is reaped  God avenges the <a id="l1474"></a>blood of the martyrs on their persecutors by  gathering the <a id="l1476"></a>Vine of the earth with a sharp sickle at the sounding of the last <a id="l1477"></a>Trumpet</p>
<p id="par67"><em class="underline">And another Angel came out  of the <a id="l1478"></a>temple in heaven he also having a sharp sickle.

For thunders signify wars &amp; wars are plagues &amp;after the seven Thunders <a id="l1504"></a>there is time no longer but the mystery of God is finished &amp; <a id="l1505"></a>the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our Lord &amp; his <a id="l1506"></a>Christ &amp; they reign for ever. These plagues of the thunders were mentioned after <a id="l1507"></a>those of the first six seales &amp; first six Trumpets &amp; after them there is no more time &amp; therefore <a id="l1508"></a>they are  the last. They were left unwritten before &amp; therefore they are written now. .</p>
<p id="par70"><em class="underline">And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire &amp; <a id="l1510"></a>them that</em> [in the  spiritual conflict or hour of temptation] had <em class="underline">gotten the victory over the Beast &amp; over his Image &amp; <a id="l1511"></a>over his mark &amp; over the number of his name</em> [that is, the <a id="l1512"></a>hundred &amp; forty four thousand who had been newly sealed with <a id="l1513"></a>the name of God in their foreheads] <em class="underline">stand on the sea of glass <a id="l1514"></a>mingled with fire</em>.

<p id="par71"><em class="underline">And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God &amp; the <a id="l1518"></a>song of the Lamb, saying, Great &amp; marvellous are thy works, <a id="l1519"></a>Lord God Almighty, just &amp; true are thy ways</em>, &amp;c. Singing is prophesying, &amp; The song of <a id="l1520"></a>the Lamb is the song which the Lamb &amp; the hundred &amp; forty four <a id="l1521"></a>thousand sang  on mount Sion before the throne &amp; before <a id="l1522"></a>the four beasts &amp; the elders where these Victors now stand. <a id="l1523"></a>This was a song of victory &amp; therefore the victory was a spiri<a id="l1524"></a>tual one such as  in all the epistles to <a id="l1525"></a>the seven churches is called overcoming. For such was the <a id="l1526"></a>victory of the Lamb &amp; the 144000. Both Victors gained a <a id="l1527"></a> victory over the Beast &amp; over his Image &amp; over his <a id="l1528"></a>mark &amp; name &amp; for this victory sang the same song in the <a id="l1529"></a>same place with harps, &amp; therefore are the same victors.</p>
<p id="par72">This song is also called the song of Moses, &amp; thereby is <a id="l1530"></a>insinuated an allusion to the victory of Moses over the Egypti<a id="l1531"></a>ans. ffor in the Prophesy of the woman &amp; Dragon, the Dragon <a id="l1532"></a>is Egypt, the woman crowned with a crown of twelve stars &amp; <a id="l1533"></a>pained in travel is the Church of the Hebrews in bondage <a id="l1534"></a>&amp; affliction &amp; the manchild with the rod of iron is Moses <a id="l1535"></a>with his rod. The Dragon Pharaoh stood ready to devour the <a id="l1536"></a>Manchild so soon as it was born. The child was preserved <a id="l1537"></a>and caught up to the throne of the Hebrews, the magicians &amp;  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p42"> &lt;24r&gt; </span> host of Egypt were overcome by Michael &amp; the Hebrews fled into <a id="l1538"></a>the wilderness upon Eagles wings &amp; there Balaam taught Balac <a id="l1539"></a>to entice them to fornication &amp; idolatry by weomen. A Dragon or <a id="l1540"></a>Crocodile was the ancient type of  Pharaoh. So Ezekiel calls <a id="l1541"></a>Pharoah the great <em class="underline">Dragon</em> that lyeth in the midst of  <a id="l1542"></a>his rivers, &amp; the <em class="underline">Dragon</em> that troubleth the waters with his feet <a id="l1543"></a>And Isaiah thus describes the coming of Israel out of Egypt. <em class="underline">Art <a id="l1544"></a>not thou he that hath cut  Rahab</em> (that is Egypt) <em class="underline">in <a id="l1545"></a>pieces &amp; wounded the Dragon? Art not thou he who dried the <a id="l1546"></a>sea —– for the ransomed to pass over</em>. And in the Psalms the <a id="l1547"></a>coming of the Church out of Egypt &amp; making a prey of the <a id="l1548"></a>drowned Egyptians is thus exprest. Thou didst divide the <a id="l1549"></a>sea by thy strength. <em class="underline">Thou breakest the heads of the Dragons <a id="l1550"></a>in the waters, thou breakest the heads of Leviathan in pieces <a id="l1551"></a>&amp; gavest him to be meat to thy people inhabiting the wil<a id="l1552"></a>derness</em>. To this many headed  Leviathan, the seven-<a id="l1553"></a>headed Dragon alludes: for the great City (the throne which <a id="l1554"></a>the Dragon relinquished to the Beast) is spiritually called <a id="l1555"></a>Egypt. Apoc 11. Conceive therefore that by reason of this allusion <a id="l1556"></a>to the history of Moses, the new song which the 144000 sang with <a id="l1557"></a>the Lamb upon mount Sion &amp; now sing upon the sea of glass, <a id="l1558"></a>is called the song of Moses. Conceive also that the 144000 <a id="l1559"></a>victors sing this song at the end of the half hours silence <a id="l1560"></a>when the Angel with the golden Censer cast fire on the <a id="l1561"></a>earth &amp; Iohn heard voices &amp; thundrings, &amp; that these voices <a id="l1562"></a>&amp; thundrings are the song it self. For they sing it for <a id="l1563"></a>the victory which they had gotten by their prayers offered up <a id="l1564"></a>to God with much incense by the Angel at the golden <a id="l1565"></a>Altar in the time of that silence: which victory was to <a id="l1566"></a>overcome the temptation of that time &amp; prevail to be <a id="l1567"></a>sealed with the name of God in their foreheads while <a id="l1568"></a>the rest of the twelve tribes were overcome by the <a id="l1569"></a>temptation &amp; carried away with the multitude to worship <a id="l1570"></a>the Beast &amp; his Image &amp; receive his mark. ffor a <a id="l1571"></a>victory over the mark of the Beast &amp; over the number <a id="l1572"></a>of his name can be nothing else then a victory whereby <a id="l1573"></a>the Victors escaped the receiving that mark &amp; num<a id="l1574"></a>ber &amp; prevailed to receive the seale of God. And so a victory <a id="l1575"></a>over the Beast &amp; over his Image, that is over their <a id="l1576"></a>worship, is escaping that worship &amp; persevering in the <a id="l1577"></a>worship of God.</p>
<p id="par73"><em class="underline">And after that I looked &amp; behold the temple of the <a id="l1578"></a>tabernacle of the testimony was opened  &amp; the <a id="l1579"></a>seven Angels came out of the temple having the seven <a id="l1580"></a>plagues, cloathed in pure &amp; white linen &amp; having their <a id="l1581"></a>breasts girded with golden girdles</em>, that is, being in the <a id="l1582"></a>habit of priests. <em class="underline">And one of the four Beasts gave unto the <a id="l1583"></a>seven Angels seven golden Vials full of the wrath of God <a id="l1584"></a>who liveth for ever &amp; ever.

By this filling of the temple of the tabernacle of <a id="l1587"></a>the testimony with smoke the dedications of the tabernacle &amp; first <a id="l1588"></a>temple are alluded unto: ffor the second temple had no testimony <a id="l1589"></a>in it. After Moses had led Israel out of Egypt &amp; sung a song of triumph <a id="l1590"></a>over the Egyptians at the red sea represented here by the sea of <a id="l1591"></a>glass, he set up the tabernacle &amp; dedicated it, &amp; from thence for<a id="l1592"></a>ward it was covered with a cloud during all the stay of the woman <a id="l1593"></a>in the wilderness. In these visions this song is sung on the sea of glass in the temple of the Tabernacle on the day of the dedication. The dedication of Solomon's temple was kept <a id="l1594"></a>upon the feast of the seventh month which began upon the 15<sup>th</sup> day <a id="l1595"></a>of the month &amp; when the Priests had brought in the Ark &amp; were <a id="l1596"></a>come out of the holy place &amp; the Levites arrayed in white <a id="l1597"></a>linnen having cymbals &amp; psalteries &amp; harps stood at the east <a id="l1598"></a>end of the Altar &amp; with them an hundred &amp; twenty Priests sound<a id="l1599"></a>ing with trumpets – &amp; were as one to make one sound &amp; lift up their voice with the trumpets &amp; <a id="l1600"></a>cymbals &amp; instruments &amp; praised the Lord, saying, For he is good, <a id="l1601"></a>for his mercy endureth for ever, then the house was filled with <a id="l1602"></a>a cloud, even the house of the Lord so that the Priests could not <a id="l1603"></a>stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of  <a id="l1604"></a>the Lord had filled the house of God. 2 Chron. 5. This dedication <a id="l1605"></a>continued seven days, that is, all the days of the feast of Taber<a id="l1606"></a>nacles, &amp; was kept with exceeding great sacrifices besides the <a id="l1607"></a>sacrifices of the ffeast. ffor Solomon sacrificed 22000 Oxen &amp; <a id="l1608"></a>120000 sheep. Conceive that the drink offerings of these sacri<a id="l1609"></a>fices are alluded unto in the seven Vials of wrath, &amp; that the <a id="l1610"></a>loud noise of  singing with Trumpets &amp; musical instruments at these <a id="l1611"></a>sacrifices are alluded unto in the seven Trumpets &amp; seven Thun<a id="l1612"></a>ders. ffor upon pouring out the drink offerings of the sacrifices <a id="l1613"></a>the Priests sounded their trumpets &amp; the Levites plaid upon musi<a id="l1614"></a>cal instruments &amp; sang till the service was ended. Ecclesiastic. c. 50. <a id="l1615"></a>So then the seven trumpets &amp; seven thunders are but several names <a id="l1616"></a>of one &amp; the same temple-music &amp; are synchronal to the <a id="l1617"></a>seven vials of wrath, as may also appear by their being the pro<a id="l1618"></a>phesy of one &amp; the same page of the sealed book, &amp; also by the <a id="l1619"></a>following comparison of the seven trumpets with the seven vials.</p>

Conceive this pit to <a id="l1777"></a>be not the open abyss or sea out of which the nations arose but the wide &amp; <a id="l1778"></a>deep sink of the temple which had a cover of stone &amp; ran down from the <a id="l1779"></a>foot of the altar into the heart of the mountain of the house &amp; from <a id="l1780"></a>thence out of the side of the mountain into the brook Kidron to convey <a id="l1781"></a>away the blood of the sacrifices &amp; the drink offerings &amp; filth of the <a id="l1782"></a>temple. Conceive also that this pit was set open at the sounding of <a id="l1783"></a>the fift Trumpet  to let out the  kingdom of <a id="l1784"></a>darkness represented by the thick &amp; dark smoke &amp; the locusts coming out of the <a id="l1785"></a>smoke, &amp; that it continued open till the sounding of the seventh <a id="l1786"></a>Trumpet. And that when the Beast &amp; fals Prophet were cast into the <a id="l1787"></a>lake of fire an Angel came down from heaven having the key <a id="l1788"></a>of this pit &amp; bound the Dragon that old serpent which is the Devil <a id="l1789"></a>&amp; Satan a thousand years &amp; cast him into this pit &amp; shut him <a id="l1790"></a>up &amp; set a seale upon him that he should deceive the nations <a id="l1791"></a>no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled: after which he <a id="l1792"></a>is loosed, deceives the nations again Gog &amp; Magog to assemble them <a id="l1793"></a>to battel against the beloved city &amp; is taken &amp; cast into the lake of <a id="l1794"></a>fire where the Beast &amp; fals Prophet were before.</p>
<p id="par77">At the sounding of the seventh Trumpet it is said that the <a id="l1795"></a>kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord &amp; of his <a id="l1796"></a>Christ &amp; he shall reign for ever &amp; ever, &amp; that his wrath is come &amp; the <a id="l1797"></a>time of the dead that they should be judged &amp; that God should give <a id="l1798"></a>rewards unto his servants the Prophets &amp; to the saints &amp; to them that <a id="l1799"></a>fear his name small &amp; great &amp; should destroy them which destroy the earth: <a id="l1800"></a>&amp; in the repetition of that prophesy the fowles of the heaven (the blessed <a id="l1801"></a>of the Lord) are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb &amp; there is <a id="l1802"></a>war between the host of heaven on white horses &amp; the kings who destroy the <a id="l1803"></a>earth, &amp; the Beast &amp; ffals Prophet are taken &amp; destroyed in the Lake of <a id="l1804"></a>fire &amp; the rest are slain with the two edged sword &amp; all the fowls are <a id="l1805"></a>filled with their flesh at the supper of the great God, that is they take the <a id="l1806"></a>kingdom. And Iohn saw thrones &amp; they sat upon them &amp; judgment was given <a id="l1807"></a>unto them, and the martyrs &amp; they that had not worshipped the Beast <a id="l1808"></a>nor his Image nor received his mark rose again from the dead &amp; reigned <a id="l1809"></a>with Christ a thousand years till the battel of Gog,<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> &amp; after that, for <a id="l1810"></a>ever &amp; ever: but the rest of the dead lived not again till the thousand <a id="l1811"></a>years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed is he that <a id="l1812"></a>hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath <a id="l1813"></a>no power. For the day of judgment must begin at the house of God. But as Christ, when he rose from the dead, conversed not <a id="l1814"></a>with mortals unless when he thought fit to appear to his disciples <a id="l1815"></a>for manifesting the truth of his resurrection: so when the saints <a id="l1816"></a>&amp; martyrs rise from the dead it is to be conceived that they <a id="l1817"></a>converse only with one another, &amp; appear not to mortals unless <a id="l1818"></a>perhaps upon very extraordinary occasions. ffor the children of the <a id="l1819"></a>resurrection are as the Angels in heaven. They have power over the <a id="l1820"></a>nations &amp; rule them with a rod of iron, but in a manner invisi<a id="l1821"></a>ble to mortals, as the Angels have done hitherto. And after the <a id="l1822"></a>thousand years are expired the rest of the dead live again small &amp; great <a id="l1823"></a>&amp; the books are opened &amp; all the dead are judged according to their works <a id="l1824"></a>&amp; whoever is not found written in the book of life is cast into the lake <a id="l1825"></a>of fire. This is the second death.   this  day of judgment,  the ancient of days sits on a great white throne (Dan. 7. 9,10. Apoc. 20.11, 12.)  &amp; the earth <a id="l1826"></a>&amp; heaven flee away &amp; there appears a new heaven &amp; new earth &amp; God makes <a id="l1827"></a>all things new &amp; a new Ierusalem comes down from God out of heaven which <a id="l1828"></a>for its power &amp; dominion &amp; glory &amp; righteousness is compared to a city of gemms <a id="l1829"></a>&amp; the nations do bring their glory into it, &amp; they reign for ages of ages.</p>

<p id="par78">The Iews &amp; the nations by which they were to be captivated, &amp; par<a id="l1833"></a>ticularly the nations within the bounds of the four Monarchies are the <a id="l1834"></a>subject of sacred prophesy in the old Testament, &amp; the nations through <a id="l1835"></a>which the Christian religion was to be propagated are the subject of <a id="l1836"></a>sacred prophesy in the new, &amp; especially of the Apocalyps. For <a id="l1837"></a>this Prophesy being given by Christ is a Revelation of such things <a id="l1838"></a>as principally concern the Christian religion &amp; therefore relate <a id="l1839"></a>chiefly to those kingdoms in which the Christian religion flourished <a id="l1840"></a>most. And so far as the new Testament has relation to the old, <a id="l1841"></a>the two last of the four monarchies are the principal subject <a id="l1842"></a>of this Prophesy. For they composed the old Roman Empire &amp; <a id="l1843"></a>the Christian religion has been propagated into all the Roman <a id="l1844"></a>Empire  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 28Ar &gt; </span> <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>Empi<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>re.

Afterwards Charles the great propagated the Roman Catholick <a id="l1858"></a>religion into all Germany by conquest, &amp; from thence it began at the same time to <a id="l1859"></a>spread into Danemark Swedeland &amp; Poland. Dacia being conquered by Trajan received the <a id="l1860"></a>Christian religion very early, sent its Patriarch to the Council of Nice &amp; was generally <a id="l1861"></a>converted before its inhabitants the Goths &amp; Vandals invaded the Empire. The Christi<a id="l1862"></a>ans who fled from the Churches of Pontus Asia &amp; Thrace in the times of Persecution <a id="l1863"></a>&amp; chiefly in the persecutions of Decius Dioclesian &amp; Maximinus, propagated the <a id="l1864"></a>Christian religion amongst the Scythians &amp;  with their disciples continued in <a id="l1865"></a>subjection to the churches from whence they fled,<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> &amp; received their bishops from <a id="l1866"></a>them , the Christians in Iberia Abasgia &amp; Alania from the Metropolitan <a id="l1867"></a>of Pontus &amp; those in Russia &amp; Chersonesus from the Metropolitan of Thrace <a id="l1868"></a>untill the times of the Council of Constantinople &amp; all of them after those <a id="l1869"></a>times from the Patriarch of Constantinople. And the Primate of Russia <a id="l1870"></a>continued to be ordeined by the Patriarch of Constantinople till about the <a id="l1871"></a>year 1588 when Hieronymus  Patriarch of Constantinople coming to <a id="l1872"></a>Moscow resigned his Patriarchal dignity to the metropolitan of that city And the Christian religion was also spread into Persia Arabia  &amp; Æthiopia under the Bishops of Antioch &amp; Alexandria.</p>
<p id="par79">So then the Christian world which is the subject of this prophesy consists of <a id="l1873"></a>three parts or Tribes: the third monarchy or Greek Empire, the fourth monarchy or <a id="l1874"></a>Latine Empire &amp; the  forreign nations. And the third part of the  earth sea rivers sun moon &amp; stars is a third part of this Christian world.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 29r resumes &gt; </span> So then the Christian world which is the subject of this prophesy con<a id="l1876"></a>sists of three parts or Tribes: the third Monarchy or Greek Empire, <a id="l1877"></a>the fourth Monarchy or Latine Empire, &amp; the northern nations <a id="l1878"></a>of Europe. And these parts being almost equal, you may know <a id="l1879"></a>by this division that the third part of the earth sea rivers sun moon <a id="l1880"></a>&amp; stars is the third part of this Christian world. And this unfolds <a id="l1881"></a>to us the mystery of counting the number of the Beast. For the <a id="l1882"></a>name &amp; number of the Beast is opposed to the name of God &amp; <a id="l1883"></a>to the number of his servants who stand on mount Sion with <a id="l1884"></a>his name on their foreheads. And in that respect the number <a id="l1885"></a>of the Beast 666 is to be counted in such manner as the num<a id="l1886"></a>ber of Gods servants 144000 was counted. This number was <a id="l1887"></a>counted by multiplying 12000 by its divisor 12 the number of <a id="l1888"></a>the Tribes of Israel (Apoc. 7) &amp; therefore 666 is to be counted <a id="l1889"></a>by multiplying some number by a divisor of that number. And <a id="l1890"></a>there is but one way of counting it in this manner, which is by <a id="l1891"></a>multiplying 222 by  its divisor 3 the number of the Tribes of <a id="l1892"></a>them that worship the Beast. </p>
<p id="par80">The four  Beasts representing the four  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p50"> &lt;30r&gt; </span> Monarchies are still in being. ffor the lives of the three first Beasts <a id="l1893"></a>were prolonged after their dominions were taken away, &amp; they con<a id="l1894"></a>tinue till a stone cut out of  a mountain without hands, breakes <a id="l1895"></a>in pieces at once all the four parts of Nebuchadnezzars Image, the <a id="l1896"></a>gold the silver the brass &amp; the iron. And since all Daniels Beasts <a id="l1897"></a>were alive in Iohn's days &amp; still continue alive &amp; therefore are <a id="l1898"></a>synchronal to Iohn's Beasts, &amp; Iohn's prophesy was given by the same <a id="l1899"></a>Holy Ghost with Daniel's &amp; is very full of allusions to the pro<a id="l1900"></a>phesies of the old testament, we may expect to find Daniel's Monar<a id="l1901"></a>chies in Iohn's prophesies so far as they relate to the Christian <a id="l1902"></a>religion. And therefore we ought to compare the prophesies of <a id="l1903"></a>Daniel &amp; Iohn &amp; agree them together so far as they can be made to <a id="l1904"></a>agree without straining. For there is no better way of interpreting <a id="l1905"></a>scripture then by comparing the parts of it &amp; reconciling all the <a id="l1906"></a>synchronall &amp; all the analogous parts of prophesy which can be re<a id="l1907"></a>conciled without force. Tis certain that the same things are <a id="l1908"></a>described again and again in prophesy: And all the descriptions of <a id="l1909"></a>one &amp; the same thing must be conjoyned that they may interpret <a id="l1910"></a>one another &amp; supply one anothers defects &amp; joyntly make one <a id="l1911"></a>complete description which cannot be misapplied to history. And those <a id="l1912"></a>interpretations are always to be preferred which reduce the parts <a id="l1913"></a>of scripture to the greatest consent &amp; harmony. Daniel has <a id="l1914"></a>described the same Monarchies again &amp; again in four seve<a id="l1915"></a>rall prophesies, &amp; yet the words were shut up &amp; sealed till the <a id="l1916"></a>time of the end. Iohn's Prophesy is a Revelation of what was <a id="l1917"></a>shut up &amp; sealed before, &amp; therefore must be compared with <a id="l1918"></a>Daniel's that all may be understood.</p>
<p id="par81">The people of the first &amp; second Monarchies beyond Armenia <a id="l1919"></a> Assyria &amp; Chaldæa, were never yet converted in great numbers to the Christian religion. <a id="l1920"></a>The third Monarchy founded by Alexander the great, was propa<a id="l1921"></a>gated down through the Roman Empire &amp; after separation from the <a id="l1922"></a>Latines was seated at Constantinople &amp; is  now under the dominion of the Turks. <a id="l1924"></a>This was the principal seat of the Christian religion in the primi<a id="l1925"></a>tive times, &amp; is represented in Daniel first by the brazen belly &amp; <a id="l1926"></a>thighs of Nebuchadnezzar's Image, then more particularly by the <a id="l1927"></a>Leopard, &amp; still more particularly by the He-Goat, &amp; in Iohn still <a id="l1928"></a>more particularly by the great red Dragon. The fourth Monarchy <a id="l1929"></a>being founded by the Latines, conquered the Greeks, then separa<a id="l1930"></a>ted from them &amp; breaking into ten kingdoms has ever since con<a id="l1931"></a>tinued in a divided form. This received the Christian religion <a id="l1932"></a>from the Greeks in the primitive times &amp; is represented in Da<a id="l1933"></a>niel first by the iron leggs &amp; feet of Nebuchadnezzars image, <a id="l1934"></a>&amp; then more particularly by the fourth Beast which was dread<a id="l1935"></a>full &amp; terrible &amp; strong exceedingly &amp; had ten horns, &amp; in Iohn <a id="l1936"></a>still more particularly by the blasphemous Beast which rose out <a id="l1937"></a>of the sea with seven heads &amp; ten horns. And as Daniel's third <a id="l1938"></a>&amp; fourth Beasts are sometimes united &amp; sometimes divided so it is <a id="l1939"></a>in Iohn. The Leopard Goat &amp; Dragon signify properly the nations over <a id="l1940"></a>which the Greeks reigned on this side  Media &amp; Persia, &amp; the <a id="l1941"></a>fourth Beast &amp; seven-headed Beast signify properly the nations of <a id="l1942"></a>the Latine Empire, but when the Greeks &amp; Latines were united in <a id="l1943"></a>one Empire the whole is represented by them all. For in Daniel the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p51"> &lt;31r&gt; </span> last horn of the Goat became greater then any of the former horns <a id="l1944"></a>&amp; the fourth Beast devoured the whole earth, &amp; therefore both of them compre<a id="l1945"></a>hended the whole Roman Empire in a general sense while the Empire con<a id="l1946"></a>tinued united,  but the Goat has a more special relation to the Greeks <a id="l1947"></a>&amp; the fourth Beast to the Latines, &amp; when the Greeks &amp; Latines sepa<a id="l1948"></a>rate, the Goat relates only to the Greeks &amp; the fourth Beast only to the <a id="l1949"></a>Latines. And so in  Iohn, when the Greeks &amp; Latines are united <a id="l1950"></a>in one Empire the whole is both Dragon &amp; Beast, but when they are <a id="l1951"></a>divided the Greek Empire is the Dragon &amp; the Latin is the Beast. <a id="l1952"></a>The Dragon at his first appearance in heaven signifies the whole <a id="l1953"></a>Roman Empire but chiefly with respect to the Greeks, &amp; the Beast <a id="l1954"></a>is latent in him: but when the Empire becomes divided, the Dragon <a id="l1955"></a> retires  from the west to signify only the Greek Empire, &amp; the Beast rises <a id="l1956"></a>out of the inhabitants of the Sea in a distinct &amp; separate form to <a id="l1957"></a>signify the Latin empire &amp; the Dragon gives him his western throne &amp; power <a id="l1958"></a>&amp; great authority.</p>
<p id="par82">Many of the ancient  heathens &amp; especially the Men<a id="l1959"></a>desians in Egypt, represented their Gods in the shape of Goats. Such <a id="l1960"></a>Gods were Pan, Faunus, Silvanus, Silenus, the Satyrs &amp; Ægipans. So <a id="l1961"></a>Selden: <em class="underline">Qui solemnia Sagarum Conciliabula aperiunt, ij Dæmonum <a id="l1962"></a>principem  qui præsidet, hirci figuram præ se ferre tradunt.</em> And <a id="l1963"></a>Diodorus: <em class="underline">The Egyptians attributed divinity to the Goat &amp; initiated <a id="l1964"></a>their Priests to this God in the first place</em>. And Majmonides: <em class="underline">E Zabijs <a id="l1965"></a>quidam fuerunt qui dæmones colebant &amp; eos existimabant habere <a id="l1966"></a>formam hircorum. Vnde etiam Dæmones Seirim, hoc est, hircos <a id="l1967"></a>appellabant. Hæc opinio Mosis ævo jam longe lateque diffusa fuit, <a id="l1968"></a>sicut ait Levit. 17.7, et non sacrificabunt sacrificia sua hircis, <a id="l1969"></a>id est, Dæmonibus ita appellatis</em>. They had sacrificed  in <a id="l1970"></a>Egypt to goats &amp; Moses forbids them doing it any more. So by <a id="l1971"></a>Goats or Satyrs in Isa. 31.21 &amp; 34.14 interpreters understand De<a id="l1972"></a>vils. And hence it is that we still paint Devils in the form of <a id="l1973"></a>Satyrs. So then as the Dragon is the old Serpent called the Devil <a id="l1974"></a>&amp; Satan, so the He-Goat in Daniel is a type of the same sig<a id="l1975"></a>nification &amp; therefore fitly applied to signify the same Empire <a id="l1976"></a>with the Dragon. This Empire was to place the abomination <a id="l1977"></a>&amp; therefore is represented by the same types with the Devil.</p>
<p id="par83">In the armies of the Roman Empire both before &amp; after <a id="l1978"></a>the Empire became Christian, a flying Eagle was the standart <a id="l1979"></a>of a Legion &amp; a Dragon the standard of a company, &amp; in every <a id="l1980"></a>Legion there were ten companies &amp; by consequence ten Dragons. <a id="l1981"></a>These Dragons were of a purple colour &amp; so fastened to the top <a id="l1982"></a>of a long pike as like weathercocks to turn their tailes from <a id="l1983"></a>the wind &amp; to hiss by means of the wind blowing into their open <a id="l1984"></a>jaws. The bearers of these two sorts of standarts were called <a id="l1985"></a>Aquiliferi &amp; Draconarij. And from these badges of the Roman <a id="l1986"></a>Empire, this Empire is represented in the second book of Esdras <a id="l1987"></a>by an Eagle &amp; in this prophesy by a great Eagle whose two wings <a id="l1988"></a>were given to the Woman that she might fly into the wilderness <a id="l1989"></a>&amp; by a great red Dragon who persecutes her. And to represent <a id="l1990"></a>the idolatrous religion &amp; large extent of the Empire, this Dragon <a id="l1991"></a>is called the Devil &amp; Satan who deceives the whole world. He is that Satan whose throne is in Pergamus  (Apoc. 2.13) &amp; Pergamus is the Metropolis of the He-Goat.</p>
<p id="par84">The seven-headed Beast by the number of his horns &amp; other  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p53"> &lt;32r&gt; </span> circumstances is manifested to be the same with Daniel's fourth <a id="l1992"></a>Beast. Both had ten horns &amp; by consequence were divided into <a id="l1993"></a>ten kingdoms which is the character of the western Empire. Dani<a id="l1994"></a>els Beast had an elventh horn, which was a distinct animal with eyes &amp; a mouth &amp; as we shewed above signifys <a id="l1995"></a>the Church of Rome &amp; so answers to the Woman riding upon <a id="l1996"></a>Iohns Beast. This Beast was like a <em class="underline">Leopard</em> &amp; had feet as <a id="l1997"></a>the feet of a <em class="underline">Beare</em> &amp; a mouth as the mouth of a <em class="underline">Lion</em> <a id="l1998"></a>Apoc. XIII.2: which is the description of Daniels fourth Beast. <a id="l1999"></a>ffor that Beast was dreadful &amp; terrible as a Leopard is, &amp; fought <a id="l2000"></a>&amp; stamped with his feet as a Bear doth, &amp; had great iron teeth <a id="l2001"></a>wherewith he  devoured &amp; brake in pieces like a Lion. <a id="l2002"></a>Daniel's three first Beasts are here named backwards &amp; <a id="l2003"></a>Iohn's is named in the room of the fourth to signify that <a id="l2004"></a>he is the fourth, &amp; is also described of like shape. And as <a id="l2005"></a>Daniel's fourth Beast reigned in his little horn a time <a id="l2006"></a>times &amp; half a time, or three years &amp; an half, so <a id="l2007"></a>Iohn's reigned 42 months which is also three years &amp; <a id="l2008"></a>an half. And lastly as Daniels fourth Beast has Rome for <a id="l2009"></a>its Metropolis so has Iohn's. ffor Iohn's Beast succeeds the Dra<a id="l2010"></a>gon in his throne, &amp; the heads of Iohn's Beast are called <a id="l2011"></a>seven hills where the Woman sitteth, which is as much as to <a id="l2012"></a>say that the head city or Metropolis of the Beast is the <a id="l2013"></a>seven-hilled City over which the Woman reigneth. She <a id="l2014"></a>sits on the Beast, that is, reigns over him, &amp; therefor <a id="l2015"></a>is his Metropolis. She is also called the great City which <a id="l2016"></a>reigneth over the kings of the earth &amp; Babylon the great <a id="l2017"></a>city: which names import that she is that great City which was <a id="l2018"></a>the Metropolis of a great Empire &amp; beseiged Ierusalem <a id="l2019"></a>burnt the Temple &amp; captivated the Iews as  old Baby<a id="l2020"></a>lon had done before. And therefore Peter writing from <a id="l2021"></a>Rome in the time of that siege &amp; alluding in many things <a id="l2022"></a>to the Apocalyps, calls Rome by the name of Babylon. <a id="l2023"></a>For all antiquity agree that Peter wrote his Epistles from <a id="l2024"></a>Rome &amp; by Babylon understood that city.</p>
<p id="par85">The Greeks called themselves Romans &amp; gave the <a id="l2025"></a>name of Romania to the Region about Constantinople <a id="l2026"></a>&amp; distinguished themselves from those of the western <a id="l2027"></a>Empire by the names of Greeks &amp; Latines. Whence <a id="l2028"></a>the word ΛΑΤΕΙΝΟΣ is the name of the western <a id="l2029"></a>Empire. This name is the proper name of a man &amp; <a id="l2030"></a>the number of this name is 666 &amp; this is the number <a id="l2031"></a>of the name of the Beast, as Irenæus hath long since observed.</p>
<p id="par86">The nations of the Roman Empire are also distin<a id="l2032"></a>guished into two parts by the names of the earth &amp; sea: as <a id="l2033"></a>where the first plague falls  on the earth, the second <a id="l2034"></a>on the sea, &amp; where the Devil comes down to the inhabitants <a id="l2035"></a>of the earth &amp; sea, &amp; where the ten horned Beast rises out  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p54"> &lt;33r&gt; </span> of the sea &amp; the two horned Beast out of the earth. And this <a id="l2036"></a>distinction seems occasioned by the language of the Iews who <a id="l2037"></a>called those countries the earth to which they travelled by land <a id="l2038"></a>&amp; those the Isles of the sea &amp; Isles of the Gentiles to which <a id="l2039"></a>they went by sea. And according to this language, the sea <a id="l2040"></a>in Iohn's days was Europe &amp; the Earth was Asia &amp;  <a id="l2041"></a>Afric, &amp; the mountains &amp; islands are the reigning cities of this <a id="l2042"></a>earth &amp; sea. And because the Eastern Empire was seated <a id="l2043"></a>chiefly in the earth &amp; the western chiefly in the sea: by the <a id="l2044"></a>earth &amp; sea we may sometimes understand these Empires. <a id="l2045"></a>And since the ten-horned Beast rises out of the sea, you <a id="l2046"></a>may know also by that character that he reigns in Europe &amp; <a id="l2047"></a>is the western Empire.</p>
<p id="par87">The Dragon has crowns upon his heads &amp; the Beast has <a id="l2048"></a>crowns upon his horns &amp; the heads &amp; horns are called kings <a id="l2049"></a>&amp; the Dragon gave the Beast his throne &amp; power &amp; great autho<a id="l2050"></a>rity &amp; by all these characters the Dragon &amp; Beast are kingdoms. <a id="l2051"></a>The Dragon is that old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan who <a id="l2052"></a>deceiveth the whole world, &amp; all the world wondred after <a id="l2053"></a>the Beast &amp; worshipped him, &amp; therefore they are very  great <a id="l2054"></a>kingdoms. The Dragon is that Satan who had his throne in <a id="l2055"></a>Pergamus &amp; dwelt there (Apoc. 2.13) &amp; this is all one as to <a id="l2056"></a>call him the kingdom of Pergamus, &amp; we shewed above <a id="l2057"></a>that this kingdom is the little horn of the He-Goat which <a id="l2058"></a>waxed exceeding great. As this horn of the Goat cast down the <a id="l2059"></a>stars of heaven to the grownd &amp; stamped upon them, so the Dragon's <a id="l2060"></a>tail drew the stars of heaven &amp; cast them to the earth. These actions <a id="l2061"></a>are of like signification: for the horn of the Goat &amp; tail of the <a id="l2062"></a>Dragon are their fighting members &amp; signify their  military <a id="l2063"></a>powers or armies commanded by their kings. By the agreement <a id="l2064"></a>of their actions you may know that they are one &amp; the same <a id="l2065"></a>kingdom. The Dragon therefore at his first appearance in heaven <a id="l2066"></a>when he stands before the Woman to devour her child signifies <a id="l2067"></a>the whole Roman Empire but chiefly with respect to the Greeks &amp; <a id="l2068"></a>the Beast is  united to him &amp; latent in him; for the Dragon &amp; Beast <a id="l2069"></a>have common heads &amp; common horns. But when the Roman Empire <a id="l2070"></a>becomes divided, the Dragon retires from the western nations to signi<a id="l2071"></a>fy only the Greek Empire &amp; the Beast rises out of the isles of the <a id="l2072"></a>sea in a distinct &amp; separate form to signify the Latine empire, &amp; <a id="l2073"></a>the Dragon gives the Beast his throne &amp; power &amp; great authority <a id="l2074"></a>among the Latines &amp; from thenceforward reigns only over the Greeks.  <a id="l2075"></a>For the Dragon did not cease at the rise of the Beast. After the <a id="l2076"></a>Beast was risen they worshipped the Dragon &amp; Beast together (Apoc. XIII.4) <a id="l2077"></a>&amp; at length three unclean spirits like froggs came out of the mouths of <a id="l2078"></a>the Dragon Beast &amp; ffals Prophet (Apoc. XVII.13) &amp; in the end when the <a id="l2079"></a>Beast is cast into the Lake of fire the Dragon is cast into the bottom<a id="l2080"></a>less pit (Apoc. XX.2.) The Dragon &amp; Beast therefore after the divi<a id="l2081"></a>sion of the Roman Empire continue in being together till the end &amp; by consequence <a id="l2082"></a>signify the eastern &amp; western or Greek &amp; Latine Empires.</p>
<p id="par88">The Dragon has crowns upon his heads &amp; not upon his horns &amp; the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p55"> &lt;34r&gt; </span> Beast has crowns upon his horns &amp; not upon his heads to signify that the <a id="l2083"></a>Dragon reigned only in the heads &amp; the Beast only in the horns, &amp; by con<a id="l2084"></a>sequence that the Dragon reigned  in the heads over the whole Roman <a id="l2085"></a>Empire untill the Beast with his horns rose out of that part of the <a id="l2086"></a>Empire called the sea or Isles of the sea &amp; received from the <a id="l2087"></a>Dragon the throne of that part of the Empire. As Daniels three <a id="l2088"></a>first Beasts remained alive after their dominions were taken <a id="l2089"></a>away, so Iohn's was alive before he rose out of the sea; &amp; being <a id="l2090"></a>till that time a part of the Dragon's kingdom he has the same  <a id="l2091"></a>heads with the Dragon, but without crowns because he reigned not <a id="l2092"></a>apart before he rose out of the sea &amp; received the Dragon's throne. <a id="l2093"></a>And while the Dragon &amp; Beast were united in one kingdom as they had <a id="l2094"></a>common heads so they had common horns, the Dragon comprehend<a id="l2095"></a>ing in his body politique the nations out of which the the ten horns at <a id="l2096"></a>length arose, but the Dragons horns were without crowns because <a id="l2097"></a>the ten kings received no kingdom while he reigned over the <a id="l2098"></a>whole, but afterwards when the Beast arose &amp; received the <a id="l2099"></a>Dragon's throne, they received power as kings at the same <a id="l2100"></a>time with the Beast. Conceive therefore that the Dragon <a id="l2101"></a>reigned in his heads over the whole Roman Empire untill the <a id="l2102"></a>Empire became divided into the Greek &amp; Latin Empires, which <a id="l2103"></a>was a little before the end of the fourth Century, &amp; that the <a id="l2104"></a>Dragon then gave his western throne to the Beast &amp; was thenceforward the Greek Empire &amp; the Beast <a id="l2105"></a>the Latine,  <a id="l2106"></a>&amp; that the ten horns are the ten kingdoms into which the Latine <a id="l2107"></a>Empire brake in the  reign of Arcadus &amp; Honorius. For there are no other divisions of the Roman Empire which <a id="l2109"></a>can answer to these things. Yet if you please you may conceive that when the Dragon gave the Beast his throne he became one of his horns, &amp; that the Beast from that time forward signifies the whole Roman Empire in a divided state, but more especially the western part of the Empire, the people of the eastern Empire being his worshippers.</p>

<h2 id="hd12" class="cent">Sect. II. <a id="l2110"></a><br>Of the Woman &amp; two-horned Beast</h2>
<p id="par89">In this Prophesy the scene of the visions is the Temple <a id="l2111"></a>&amp; the worship of Christians is described in the Temple under the <a id="l2112"></a>form of the Iewish worship as we shewed above. And hence the Chris<a id="l2113"></a>tian Churches are represented in this prophesy by the twelve tribes of <a id="l2114"></a>Israel, &amp; when some are numbered out of the twelve Tribes &amp; sealed <a id="l2115"></a>with the seale of God, the rest of the Tribes who are not sealed become <a id="l2116"></a>the Synagogue of Satan who say they are Iews &amp; are not, that is, who <a id="l2117"></a>profess themselves Christians but are the Curch of the Devil. ffor <a id="l2118"></a>all men whose names are not written in the book of life, that <a id="l2119"></a>is, all who are not sealed with the seale of God, wonder after the <a id="l2120"></a>Beast &amp; worship him &amp; his Image &amp; receive his mark. When the <a id="l2121"></a>saints are sealed out of the twelve Tribes, the rest of the Tribes <a id="l2122"></a>receive the mark of the Beast &amp; become the Synagogue of Satan, <a id="l2123"></a>&amp; therefore they that have the mark of the Beast &amp; worship <a id="l2124"></a>him &amp; his Image, are Christians in outward profession.</p>
<p id="par90">And as the Tribes of Israel &amp; Iudah are in the old Testa<a id="l2125"></a>ment represented by weomen, so the Church of Christ signified by those <a id="l2126"></a>Tribes is here represented by the Lamb's wife &amp; by the glorious Woman in <a id="l2127"></a>heaven. For this Woman     <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p56"> &lt;35r&gt; </span>  by having the Sun Moon &amp; stars about her is represented the feminine part of a kingdom, the kingdom of Christ. She is cloathed or invested with the power of Christ her king represented by the Sun. She has under her feet the common people represented by the Moon &amp; upon her head a crown of  <a id="l2130"></a>twelve stars, which are the twelve Apostles &amp; a symbol of the twelve tribes, &amp; her seed <a id="l2131"></a>keep the commandments of God &amp; have the testimony of <a id="l2132"></a>Iesus, &amp; therefore she is the Church. In the first ages <a id="l2133"></a>of Christianity she is the true sincere Church of Christ diffused <a id="l2134"></a>through the whole Roman Empire represented by the <a id="l2135"></a>Dragon: but upon the division of the Empire into two <a id="l2136"></a>Empires represented by the Dragon &amp; ten-horned Beast <a id="l2137"></a>the visible Church degenerates &amp; becomes divided into <a id="l2138"></a>two Churches represented by the Woman &amp; two-horned <a id="l2139"></a>Beast. For upon this division of the Empire the Woman <a id="l2140"></a>&amp; Dragon part from one another. She flies from the <a id="l2141"></a>Dragon into the western Empire called a wilderness <a id="l2142"></a>for its spiritual barrenness &amp; desolation, &amp;  is nourished in her place in the <a id="l2145"></a>Wilderness for a time times &amp; half a time from the face <a id="l2146"></a>of the Serpent: And the Dragon gives the Beast his western throne. And as the ten horned Beast rises out <a id="l2147"></a>of the Sea to succeed the Dragon in the western Empire <a id="l2148"></a>so the two horned Beast rises out of the Earth to succeed <a id="l2149"></a>the Woman in the eastern Empire. While the Empire <a id="l2150"></a>continues undivided the Dragon signifies the whole Empire <a id="l2151"></a>&amp; the Woman the whole Church thereof: but upon the <a id="l2152"></a>division of the Empire the Dragon is restrained to signify <a id="l2153"></a>the eastern part thereof &amp; the Woman to signify the Church <a id="l2154"></a>of the western part: And this separation is represented by <a id="l2155"></a>the Womans flying from the Dragon &amp; being nourished in the wilderness from the face of the Serpent: and the ten-horned <a id="l2156"></a>Beast rises out of the sea to succeed the Dragon in the <a id="l2157"></a>western part of the Empire, &amp; the two-horned Beast out <a id="l2158"></a>of the Earth to succeed the Woman in the eastern part <a id="l2159"></a>thereof.</p>
<p id="par91">Every kingdom hath its Church, &amp; the Churches of the <a id="l2160"></a>Dragon &amp; ten-horned Beast are the two-horned Beast <a id="l2161"></a>and the Woman in the Wilderness. For when she fled <a id="l2162"></a>into the Wilderness she fled from the Dragon, &amp; therefore <a id="l2163"></a>ceased to be in his kingdom. She was afterwards found in the <a id="l2164"></a>Wilderness sitting upon the ten-horned Beast, that is, reigning <a id="l2165"></a>over him, &amp; therefore became his Church. She is the great <a id="l2166"></a>City which reigneth over the kings of the earth represented by <a id="l2167"></a>the ten horns of the Beast. She is Babylon the great, the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p57"> &lt;36r&gt; </span> western Babylon which captivated the Iewish nation <a id="l2168"></a>the great city seated upon seven hills &amp; by consequence <a id="l2169"></a>the Church of Rome. And this Church is the Church <a id="l2170"></a>catholick of the western nations &amp; kingdoms into which <a id="l2171"></a>the Latine Empire becomes now divided.</p>
<p id="par92">And the two-horned Beast rose out of the earth <a id="l2172"></a>or nations of the eastern Empire, &amp; therefore is <a id="l2173"></a>seated in that Empire. It hath two horns like the <a id="l2174"></a>Lamb, that is, two churches like the seven churches <a id="l2175"></a>of Asia signified by the seven horns of the <a id="l2176"></a>Lamb, &amp; therefore is an ecclesiastical body. It speaks <a id="l2177"></a>as the Dragon &amp; therefore is of the Dragon's religion. <a id="l2178"></a>And a Church in the eastern Empire of the Dragon's <a id="l2179"></a>language &amp; religion is the Greek church. This Beast <a id="l2180"></a>by means of fals miracles deceiveth them that dwell <a id="l2181"></a>on the earth &amp; for doing so is called the fals Pro<a id="l2182"></a>phet, &amp; therefore is of an ecclesiastical kind, <a id="l2183"></a>and this fals Prophet survives the Whore of <a id="l2184"></a>Babylon being cast alive into the lake of fire <a id="l2185"></a>after the ten kings have eaten the flesh of the <a id="l2186"></a>Whore &amp; burnt her with fire, &amp; therefore this <a id="l2187"></a>Prophet differs from the Whore &amp; signifies another <a id="l2188"></a>idolatrous Church, &amp; by consequence the Greek <a id="l2189"></a>Church or Church of the Greek Empire. This <a id="l2190"></a>Church is also called the synagogue of Satan. For <a id="l2191"></a>the Dragon is that old Serpent called the Devil &amp; <a id="l2192"></a>Satan, &amp; therefore the synangogue of Satan is the <a id="l2193"></a>Church of the Dragon.</p>

<h2 id="hd13" class="cent">Sect. III. <a id="l2194"></a><br>Of the division of Empire &amp; Church <a id="l2195"></a>into two Empires &amp; two Churches.</h2>
<p id="par93">When the Temple was opened in heaven for Iohn to see the <a id="l2196"></a>visions in it, he saw there the Ark of the Testament, &amp; the child-bear<a id="l2197"></a>ing Woman &amp; the Dragon standing by her &amp; how her child was caught up <a id="l2198"></a>to the throne of God above the Ark, &amp; the Dragon was cast out of this <a id="l2199"></a>Temple of heaven by Michael into the outward court or court of the <a id="l2200"></a>people which people are here called the inhabitants of the earth &amp; <a id="l2201"></a>sea, &amp; how the Woman (in allusion to the Babylonian captivity) fled from <a id="l2202"></a>this Temple though the Wilderness of Arabia to serve  her Gods wood <a id="l2203"></a>&amp; stone, &amp; became seated in the great city Babylon which reigneth over <a id="l2204"></a>the kings of the earth &amp; left a remnant of her seed with the Dragon <a id="l2205"></a>in the outward court of the Temple. There he saw the two Beasts <a id="l2206"></a>rise out of the  sea &amp; earth &amp; the second Beast deify the first <a id="l2207"></a>&amp; cause men to erect an Image to him &amp; to worship the Image. <a id="l2208"></a>There the Dragon by the dictates of the speaking Image (before he <a id="l2209"></a>gave his throne to the Beast) made war upon the Womans seed <a id="l2210"></a>&amp; mystically killed all that would not worship the Image: &amp; there <a id="l2211"></a>all men received the mark or name of the Beast or number <a id="l2212"></a>of his name except the 144000 who were sealed with the name <a id="l2213"></a>of God &amp; being forbid to buy or sell &amp; by consequence interdicted <a id="l2214"></a>society by excommunication, retire from the multitude in the <a id="l2215"></a>outward court of the Temple &amp; stand on mount Sion with the <a id="l2216"></a>Lamb &amp; sing a new song before the throne &amp; the four Beasts &amp; <a id="l2217"></a>the Elders &amp; by consequence in the  inner Court at the eastern <a id="l2218"></a>border thereof called the Court of Israel. ffor there the singing <a id="l2219"></a>used to be performed. And when the Dragon had mystically killed those <a id="l2220"></a>that would not worship the Image of the Beast in the outward Court <a id="l2221"></a>&amp; interdicted communion to those that would not  receive <a id="l2222"></a>his mark, he there gave the Beast his throne &amp; power &amp; great authority <a id="l2223"></a>And all the world wondred after the Beast, &amp; power was given him over <a id="l2224"></a>all kindreds &amp; tongues &amp; nations, &amp; all that dwell upon earth worship <a id="l2225"></a>him [&amp; his Image] whose names are not written in the book of life.</p>
<p id="par94">In the beginning of the visions in the Temple which was opened in <a id="l2226"></a>heaven the Ark was seen in it, &amp; therefore it was the Tabernacle or <a id="l2227"></a>first Temple or Temple of the Tabernacle as it is afterwards called. <a id="l2228"></a>Now they that worshipped in the Tabernacle &amp; first temple were <a id="l2229"></a>the twelve tribes of Israel, &amp; the Woman which appeared in this <a id="l2230"></a>Temple had upon her head a crown of twelve stars to represent <a id="l2231"></a>these tribes, &amp; out of all these tribes the 144000 were numbred &amp; <a id="l2232"></a>sealed, &amp; twelve tribes being all Israel represent the Church catho<a id="l2233"></a>lick; &amp; this church inhabited the earth &amp; sea because the Angel who <a id="l2234"></a>had the seal of God cried with a loud voice saying: Hurt not the earth <a id="l2235"></a>&amp; sea till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. <a id="l2236"></a>These tribes are the inhabiters of the earth &amp; sea to whom the <a id="l2237"></a>Dragon came down from his heathen throne with great wrath, <a id="l2238"></a>the earth &amp; sea upon which the Son of man stood with the little book <a id="l2239"></a>open in his hand, the earth out of which the two horned Beast arose <a id="l2240"></a>&amp; on which the plage of the first Trumpet &amp; Vial fell &amp; the sea <a id="l2241"></a>out of which the ten-horned Beast arose &amp; on which the plague <a id="l2242"></a>of the second Trumpet &amp; Vial fell. For the earth &amp; sea with their <a id="l2243"></a>inhabitants are the subject of this prophesy. The Church catholick <a id="l2244"></a>therefore by the sealing of 144000 out of the twelve tribes &amp;  separation of <a id="l2245"></a>the rest  becomes divided into two parties. The  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p59"> &lt;38r&gt; </span> multitude receive the mark or name of the Beast or number of his <a id="l2246"></a>name &amp; continue in the outward court of the Temple where <a id="l2247"></a>they used to worship &amp; there worship the Beast &amp; his Image  &amp; the 144000 are sealed with the name of God &amp; being <a id="l2249"></a>excommunicated by the multitude retire into the Court of Israel in <a id="l2250"></a>the eastern border of the Priests court.</p>
<p id="par95">The Beast was slain with a sword &amp; revived before he <a id="l2251"></a>rose out of the sea with the wound healed in one of his heads, <a id="l2252"></a>And after his death &amp; resurrection the two horned Beast conse<a id="l2253"></a>crated him a God &amp; caused an Image to be erected to him as his Oracle <a id="l2254"></a>&amp; that he &amp; his Image should be worshipped &amp; all men be initiated <a id="l2255"></a>in the society of his worshippers. For the receiving his mark or <a id="l2256"></a>name or the number of his name is being initiated in the worship <a id="l2257"></a>of him &amp; his Image as the heathens were initiated in the wor<a id="l2258"></a>ship of their Gods by being marked in the arm or neck with the <a id="l2259"></a>mark or name or number of the name of the God to whose <a id="l2260"></a>worship they were dedicated. And because those that were ini<a id="l2261"></a>tiated in the religion &amp; society of the worshippers of the Beast <a id="l2262"></a>&amp; his Image were of the twelve Tribes of Israel &amp; all were <a id="l2263"></a>initiated except 144000 &amp; excommunicated those that would not <a id="l2264"></a>be initiated  its manifiest that the <a id="l2265"></a>Church catholick at this time suffered a very great alteration in <a id="l2266"></a>respect of her numbers &amp; constitution. The external form of <a id="l2267"></a>Church government in the west went along with the Woman into the wilder<a id="l2268"></a>ness &amp; was taken from the remnant of her seed by killing those <a id="l2269"></a>in the east who would not worship the image of the Beast <a id="l2270"></a>&amp; excommunicating those in all the Empire who would not <a id="l2271"></a>receive his mark. By this means the Church catholick was <a id="l2272"></a>reduced to the small number of 144000 sealed out of all <a id="l2273"></a>the twelve tribes of Israel. And these remained in a state <a id="l2274"></a>of persecution &amp; affliction under the persecuting Dragon <a id="l2275"></a>&amp; Beast like the 7000 who had not bowed the knee to Baal <a id="l2276"></a>in the days of Ahab &amp; Iezabel.</p>
<p id="par96">And this great change is further represented by <a id="l2277"></a>measuring the   courts of the Temple &amp; Altar &amp;  them that worship therein as was done in the <a id="l2279"></a>time of the Babylonian captivity by Ezekiel, &amp; by placing two <a id="l2280"></a>candlesticks  &amp; two olive-trees in the room of the sevenfold golden <a id="l2281"></a>candlestick to represent the Church, &amp; by changing the shape of <a id="l2282"></a>the Lamb with seven horns who opened the seven seals into <a id="l2283"></a>that of the High-priest &amp; his coming down from heaven with the <a id="l2284"></a>book open in his hand &amp; standing upon the earth &amp; sea with <a id="l2285"></a> his two burning leggs, &amp; by the dedication of a new Temple <a id="l2286"></a>signified by the smoke with which the  <a id="l2287"></a>Temple  of the Tabernacle was filled from the glory of God <a id="l2288"></a>&amp; in Paul's Epistles by the falling away &amp; the revelation of <a id="l2289"></a>the Man of Sin. For the Beast with his worshippers is this Man of Sin <a id="l2290"></a>For the apostasy  to the worship of the Beast was universal: all men <a id="l2291"></a>wondred after him whose names were not written in the book of life <a id="l2292"></a>&amp; therefore there could not be a greater Man of sin. The Beast is worshipped in <a id="l2293"></a>the outward court of the Temple which is given to the Gentiles or nations <a id="l2294"></a>for this worship: &amp; the Man of Sin sits in the Temple of God shewing <a id="l2295"></a>himself that he is a God. The Beast received the Dragons throne  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p60"> &lt;39r&gt; </span> and <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>power &amp; overcame<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the saints &amp; none were able to make war with him, &amp; the Man of Sin <a id="l2296"></a>opposed &amp; exalted himself above every thing that is called God <a id="l2297"></a>or that is worshipped. The Beast rose out of the sea after the <a id="l2298"></a>fall of the heathen Roman Empire &amp; reigned till the Word of God <a id="l2299"></a>came against him in the clouds of heaven with a two edged <a id="l2300"></a>sword coming out of his mouth &amp; caused him to be taken <a id="l2301"></a> &amp; cast alive into the lake of fire; &amp; the Man of sin was <a id="l2302"></a>to be revealed after the heathen Roman Empire which letted <a id="l2303"></a>should be taken out of the way &amp; to continue till Christ should <a id="l2304"></a>destroy him with the breath of his mouth &amp; the brightness of his <a id="l2305"></a>coming. When the Beast rose out of the sea &amp; began to be wor<a id="l2306"></a>shipped, the invocation of Saints by meanes of a great noise of <a id="l2307"></a>miracles pretended to be done by the dead Saints &amp; their reliques <a id="l2308"></a>overspread the Empire, &amp; the coming of the Man of Sin was with <a id="l2309"></a>all signes &amp; lying wonders in them that perish. At that time the <a id="l2310"></a>Beast &amp; his worshippers separated from the communion of the <a id="l2311"></a>144000 as is signified by sealing &amp; marking  two parties <a id="l2312"></a>the one with the name of God &amp; Christ the other with the name of <a id="l2313"></a>the Beast: &amp; the revelation of the Man of sin was in like manner <a id="l2314"></a>made by his separating from the Church of God. For Iohn speaking <a id="l2315"></a>of the great Antichrist &amp; his forerunners, saith: <em class="underline">As ye have heard <a id="l2316"></a>that Antichrist shall come, even now there are many Antichrists, <a id="l2317"></a>whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, <a id="l2318"></a>but they were not of us: for if they had been of us they would <a id="l2319"></a>have continued with us: but they went out that they might <a id="l2320"></a>be made manifest that they were not all of us</em>. While those <a id="l2321"></a>of erroneous opinions concerning the objects of worship continued <a id="l2322"></a>in communion with the Church the mystery of iniquity worked <a id="l2323"></a>in them &amp; where any of them separated &amp; went out from her <a id="l2324"></a>communion, then they were made manifest  &amp; revealed &amp; became Antichrists, &amp; <a id="l2325"></a>such a manifestation of the great Antichrist Iohn calls the coming <a id="l2326"></a>of the Antichrist &amp; Paul the revelation of the Man of sin. This <a id="l2327"></a>mystery of iniquity began to work in the Apostles days &amp; produced <a id="l2328"></a>many separations from the Church all which in the language of <a id="l2329"></a>the Apostles were Antichrists; &amp; was to continue working till <a id="l2330"></a>it should produce the great separation called by the Apostles <a id="l2331"></a>the Antichrist <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> the Man of sin.  <a id="l2332"></a> <a id="l2334"></a>And it is observable that the revelation from whence the Apocalyps <a id="l2335"></a>hath its name, is made by opening the seals of the propphetick book <a id="l2336"></a>successively untill all the book be opened, &amp; that upon opening the <a id="l2337"></a>last seal the Man of sin is revealed. ffor then the Beast rises out <a id="l2338"></a>of the sea &amp; all receive his mark except the 144000 who are <a id="l2339"></a>interdicted buying &amp; selling for not receiving it; &amp; from thenceforward <a id="l2340"></a>the Gentiles or nations worship him &amp; his Image in the outward <a id="l2341"></a>court of the Temple, that is, in an outward form of religion &amp; <a id="l2342"></a>Church government;  &amp; the 144000 are excommunicated &amp; ex<a id="l2343"></a>pelled that Court &amp; retire into the inner part of the Temple untill <a id="l2344"></a>the sanctuary shall be cleansed.</p>
<p id="par97">While the twelve tribes continue united in one communion, the <a id="l2345"></a>whole is represented by the mystical body of Christ &amp; by the Candlesticks <a id="l2346"></a>in the Temple &amp; by the Woman in heaven; But when the Woman in <a id="l2347"></a> flying into the Wilderness recedes from the communion of <a id="l2348"></a>the remnant of her seed &amp; the multitude  of Israel receive the mark of the Beast, they cease to be a part <a id="l2350"></a>of Christs mystical body &amp; of the Church represented by the Candle<a id="l2351"></a>sticks in the Temple; &amp; those that are sealed with the name of  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p61"> &lt;40r&gt; </span> God cease to be a part of the mystical body of the apostatizing Woman <a id="l2352"></a>&amp; both parties begin to be represented apart by proper types. The <a id="l2353"></a>mystical body of Christ &amp; the Candlesticks in the Temple hencefor<a id="l2354"></a>ward signify only those that are sealed with the name of God &amp; <a id="l2355"></a>the Woman &amp; two Beasts &amp; Dragon signify only those who <a id="l2356"></a>wonder after the Beast &amp; receive his mark. And this distinction <a id="l2357"></a>begins when the two Beasts rise out of the sea &amp; earth &amp; the <a id="l2358"></a>second deifies the first &amp;  creates all his divine power &amp; autho<a id="l2359"></a>rity before him, &amp; causeth the earth &amp; them that dwell therin <a id="l2360"></a>to worship him, &amp;  doth great miracles so as to bring down the <a id="l2361"></a>fire of excommunication from heaven upon earth in the sight <a id="l2362"></a>of men against those that will not worship him &amp; causes <a id="l2363"></a>an image to be made to him &amp; worshipped, &amp; the Dragon by <a id="l2364"></a>the influence of that Beast begins the war upon the remnant <a id="l2365"></a>of the womans seed &amp; kills all that will not worship the Image <a id="l2366"></a> &amp; forbids buying &amp; selling to all that do not receive the mark <a id="l2367"></a>or name of the first Beast, &amp; all the twelve tribes receive his mark or name <a id="l2368"></a>except the 144000 who at the same time are sealed with the <a id="l2369"></a>seale of God. And this marking &amp; sealing was between the opening <a id="l2370"></a>of the seventh Seal &amp; sounding of the  first Trumpet. Apoc. 7.2, 3 <a id="l2371"></a>&amp; 16.2.</p>
<p id="par98">The Temple being the scene of the visions I conceive <a id="l2372"></a>that it remains the same from the beginning to the end, &amp; that <a id="l2373"></a>in allusion to the times of the Tabernacle or first Temple or <a id="l2374"></a>those of the second for representing the various states of the <a id="l2375"></a>Church the things that appear in the Temple are only changed. And <a id="l2376"></a>in all cases the Church is represented by the Candlesticks which appear <a id="l2377"></a>in the Temple &amp; by the mystical body of Christ in what form soever <a id="l2378"></a>he appears &amp; by the four Beasts whenever they appear. In the <a id="l2379"></a>beginning of the Prophesy untill the seventh Trumpet is ready to <a id="l2380"></a>sound, &amp; again in the repetition or interpretation of this prophesy <a id="l2381"></a>from the time that the Temple of God was opened in heaven <a id="l2382"></a>&amp; the Ark of his testament was seen in it untill the seventh Viall <a id="l2383"></a>be poured out, the times of the  Tabernacle &amp; first Temple <a id="l2384"></a>are alluded unto. And in all these visions the Church of God is <a id="l2385"></a>represented by the golden Candlestick with seven branches which <a id="l2386"></a>was placed in the Tabernacle &amp; first Temple. Solomon placed <a id="l2387"></a>ten such candlesticks in the first Temple, but each of them <a id="l2388"></a>being sufficient to represent the Church, there is but one with <a id="l2389"></a>its seven branches considered in the prophesy. In this Taber<a id="l2390"></a>nacle or Temple the Church is also represented by the <a id="l2391"></a>four Beasts &amp; by the Lamb with seven horns whether he <a id="l2392"></a>appears before the throne &amp; opens the seales of the Book or <a id="l2393"></a>stands on mount Sion with the 144000. In the latter part of <a id="l2394"></a>the prophesy from the time that the mighty Angel comes down <a id="l2395"></a>from heaven with the Book open in his hand untill the sounding <a id="l2396"></a>of the seventh Trumpet, &amp; again in the repetition or interpre<a id="l2397"></a>tation of this part of the prophesy when one of the seven Angels <a id="l2398"></a>carries Iohn into the wilderness to see the great whore sitting upon <a id="l2399"></a>her Beast, the times of the Babylonian captivity &amp; second Temple are <a id="l2400"></a>alluded unto, &amp; the Church of God is represented by the two Candlesticks <a id="l2401"></a>&amp; two olive-trees which the Iews (out of poverty) placed in this Temple <a id="l2402"></a>upon their first return from captivity Zech. 4, &amp; by the mystical <a id="l2403"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>b<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ody of the Son of man in the form of an Angel with feet as  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p62"> &lt;41r&gt; </span> pillars of fire standing on the earth &amp; sea, &amp; instead of the <a id="l2404"></a>four Beasts the Gentiles are placed in the outward Court. <a id="l2405"></a>ffor Zerubbabel built only the courts of the Temple &amp; <a id="l2406"></a>Altar &amp; the new Court or weomens court for the use of God's people &amp; <a id="l2407"></a>left the outward court unbuilt &amp; open to the Gentiles. When <a id="l2408"></a>the twelve tribes of Israel represented by the four Beasts <a id="l2409"></a>standing in the outward court, became divided into two parties <a id="l2410"></a>one of which is sealed with the seal of God &amp; the other receives <a id="l2411"></a>the mark of the Beast: the multitude of Israel which receive <a id="l2412"></a>the mark of the Beast still continue in the outward <a id="l2413"></a>court &amp; for their idolatry in worshipping the Beast &amp; <a id="l2414"></a>his Image as the heathens worshipped their fals Gods &amp; <a id="l2415"></a>Idols, are called Gentiles. These are the synagogue of <a id="l2416"></a>Satan who say they are Iews &amp; are not. They have an <a id="l2417"></a>outward form of religion &amp; church government &amp; therefore <a id="l2418"></a>are said to worship in the outward court, but under this form <a id="l2419"></a>of religion &amp; church government they worship the Beast &amp; his <a id="l2420"></a>Image &amp; therefore are gentiles. And tho they worship in the out<a id="l2421"></a>ward court of the Temple they tread under foot the holy city <a id="l2422"></a>&amp; therefore are Babylonian gentiles. As the Woman upon de<a id="l2423"></a>generating becomes the great city Babylon, so the four Beasts <a id="l2424"></a> in the outward court representing the twelve tribes of Israel <a id="l2425"></a>upon revolting from the worship of God to the worship of the <a id="l2426"></a>Beast &amp; his Image become the Babylonian Gentiles treading <a id="l2427"></a>under foot the holy city &amp; worshipping in the outward court <a id="l2428"></a>of the Temple. When the Tabernacle or first Temple is <a id="l2429"></a>alluded unto there are 144000 sealed out of all the twelve <a id="l2430"></a>tribes of Israel &amp; an Angel filled a Censer with fire of the altar &amp; cast it to the earth, &amp; this is in allusion to Ezekiels vision in the <a id="l2431"></a>times of the first Temple  just before the Babylonian <a id="l2432"></a>captivity when a man was commanded to go through the midst <a id="l2433"></a>of Ierusalem &amp; set a mark upon the foreheads of the men <a id="l2434"></a>that sighed &amp; cried for all the abominations done in the midst <a id="l2435"></a>thereof, &amp; to take coals of fire from between the Cherubims <a id="l2436"></a>&amp; scatter them over the city. When the  times of <a id="l2437"></a>the Babylonian captivity &amp; second temple are alluded unto Iohn is <a id="l2438"></a>commanded to measure the temple &amp; altar &amp; the court of them that <a id="l2439"></a>worship therin &amp; this is in allusion to Ezekiels measuring the Tem<a id="l2440"></a>ple &amp; altar with their courts in the beginning of the Babylonian <a id="l2441"></a>captivity. When the Tabernacle &amp; first Temple is alluded unto <a id="l2442"></a>the 144000 who are sealed &amp; get the victory over the mark of the <a id="l2443"></a>Beast stand on mount Sion with the Lamb &amp; sing a new song before <a id="l2444"></a>the throne &amp; before the four Beasts &amp; the Elders.  There <a id="l2445"></a>they stand on the sea of glass &amp; sing the song of Moses &amp; the <a id="l2446"></a>Lamb &amp; the temple of the Tabernacle was filled with smoke <a id="l2447"></a>from the glory of God &amp; from his power so that no man was able <a id="l2448"></a>to enter into the temple: &amp; this is in allusion to the dedication of <a id="l2449"></a>the Tabernacle &amp; Solomons Temple &amp; signifies a new state of <a id="l2450"></a>the Church commencing with the  sealing of those that <a id="l2451"></a>get the victory over the mark of the Beast &amp; worship in this <a id="l2452"></a>temple. And when the second temple is alluded unto the same <a id="l2453"></a>thing is signified by measuring the Temple &amp; Altar in token <a id="l2454"></a>of rebuilding them with their courts for those that worship <a id="l2455"></a>therein: ffor measuring is a type of building Zech. 2.2, 4. And <a id="l2456"></a>because in the tabernacle &amp; first Temple there was a golden  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p64"> &lt;42r&gt; </span> candlestick with seven branches &amp; in the second Temple <a id="l2457"></a>two Candlesticks  &amp; two olive-trees: the septenary number is <a id="l2458"></a>applied to the Church when the  tabernacle or first <a id="l2459"></a>Temple is alluded unto &amp; the binary when the second. <a id="l2460"></a>In respect of the seven churches of Asia which in the <a id="l2461"></a>beginning of the prophesy were made a type of the <a id="l2462"></a>Church catholick the church in all ages is represented <a id="l2463"></a>by the seven  horns of the Lamb &amp; seven <a id="l2464"></a>golden Candlesticks, &amp; in respect of the division of <a id="l2465"></a>the Roman Empire into two Empires whereby the <a id="l2466"></a>Woman received two Wings of a great Eagle the <a id="l2467"></a>sincere part of the Churches represented by those <a id="l2468"></a>two wings are typified by the two burning leggs <a id="l2469"></a>of Christ &amp; by the two candlesticks  &amp; two olive-trees <a id="l2470"></a>&amp; for their sufferings &amp; testimony called the two <a id="l2471"></a>witnesses. When the Temple of the Tabernacle is alluded <a id="l2472"></a>unto, the Angels of the seven Churches  sound the seven Trum<a id="l2473"></a>pets &amp; one of the four Beasts gives the seven Angels seven <a id="l2474"></a>Vialls of wrath to pour out upon the apostates: &amp; when the <a id="l2475"></a>second Temple is alluded unto the two Witnesses execute the <a id="l2476"></a>seven plagues. <em class="underline">If any will hurt them fire proceedeth out of <a id="l2477"></a>their mouth &amp; devoureth their enemies. — These have power <a id="l2478"></a>over the waters to turn them to blood &amp; to smite the earth <a id="l2479"></a>with all plagues as often as they will</em>; that is with all the seven <a id="l2480"></a>plagues.</p>

<p id="par100">When the Dragon signifies the whole Roman Empire the Woman signifies <a id="l2560"></a>the whole Church untill by the persecution of the Dragon she separates in <a id="l2561"></a>communion from the remnant of her seed who keep the commandments of God <a id="l2562"></a>&amp; have the testimony of Iesus, &amp; then she signifies a Church in a state <a id="l2563"></a>of defection schism &amp; apostasy from that remnant, &amp; the remnant signifies <a id="l2564"></a>the whole true church of God. And when two Beasts arise, one out of <a id="l2565"></a>the inhabitants of the Sea the other out of the inhabitants of the earth, <a id="l2566"></a>&amp; the Dragon retiring to the shore gives the Beast his throne in the sea <a id="l2567"></a>the empire becomes divided into two Empires the empires of the earth <a id="l2568"></a>&amp; sea or east and west, &amp; the Woman retires into the west from <a id="l2569"></a>the face of the Serpent &amp; sitting upon the first Beast becomes his <a id="l2570"></a>church, &amp; the second Beast succeeds the Woman in the earth &amp; <a id="l2571"></a>becomes the Church of the Dragon. ffor this Beast is a fals Prophet &amp; has <a id="l2572"></a>ecclesiastical horns &amp; speaks as the Dragon &amp; therefore is a Church <a id="l2573"></a>of the Dragons religion. And the Remnant of the Womans seed, or <a id="l2574"></a>as many of them as in the war which the Dragon made upon them, were <a id="l2575"></a>sealed out of all the twelve tribes of Israel, continue to be the true <a id="l2576"></a>Church of God persecuted by the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea &amp; <a id="l2577"></a>testifying against the fals Prophet &amp; the Woman, &amp; called the two Wit<a id="l2578"></a>nesses with relation to those inhabitants &amp; to the two wings of the Woman whose <a id="l2579"></a>seed they are. Thus the Empire becomes divided into two Empires with their <a id="l2580"></a>Churches fals &amp; true: the Dragon the two-horned Beast &amp; one witness <a id="l2581"></a>in the earth; the ten horned Beast the Woman &amp; the other witness <a id="l2582"></a>in the sea. But yet God having but one  Church &amp; one <a id="l2583"></a>Temple, the two Witnesses are but one Church &amp; one double Candlestick <a id="l2584"></a>in that Temple, distinguished into the Churches of the earth &amp; sea but <a id="l2585"></a>not divided from one another. And the name of two Witnesses being <a id="l2586"></a>now the name of the Church catholick of God; he that hurts any <a id="l2587"></a>considerable part of this Church, hurts the two Witnesses. And altho <a id="l2588"></a>the Beast is now the name of the Western Empire, yet since <a id="l2589"></a>by the influence of the two horned Beast he is deified &amp; worship<a id="l2590"></a>ped in the earth, &amp; all men receive his mark, &amp; power was <a id="l2591"></a>given him over all kindreds &amp; tongues &amp; nations, &amp; all that dwell <a id="l2592"></a>upon the earth worship him whose names are not written in the book <a id="l2593"></a>of life &amp; all the world wonders after him: he may be sometimes <a id="l2594"></a>taken in a larger sense so as to include all his worshippers, especi<a id="l2595"></a>ally when the Witnesses are considered as prophesying against him <a id="l2596"></a>or he is considered as making war upon them.</p>

<h2 id="hd14" class="cent">Sect. IV. <a id="l2597"></a><br>A further account of the division of <a id="l2598"></a>the Roman Empire.</h2>
<p id="par101">Iohn tells us that before the Beast ascended out of the <a id="l2599"></a>abyss five of the kings represented by his heads were fallen <a id="l2600"></a>&amp; the sixt was then in being. ffor before he ascended he was <a id="l2601"></a>latent in the Dragons mystical body &amp; therefore partakes <a id="l2602"></a>of all his heads. ffor he was the water which the Dragon cast <a id="l2603"></a>out of his mouth as a flood after the Woman to cause her <a id="l2604"></a>to be carried away of the flood. ffor waters are peoples &amp; <a id="l2605"></a>nations &amp; multitudes &amp; tongues, &amp; an aggregate of waters <a id="l2606"></a>as a stream a river a flood or sea is an aggregate of men, <a id="l2607"></a>a body politick or ecclesiastick, a kingdom or a Church. <a id="l2608"></a>The waters which Christ spewed out of his mouth signify a body <a id="l2609"></a>ecclesiastick, the Church of Laodicea, first united to Christ's <a id="l2610"></a>mystical body as a part thereof &amp; afterwards in a state of separation <a id="l2611"></a>or schism: &amp; in like manner the waters which the Dragon casts <a id="l2612"></a>out of his mouth must signify a body politick first united <a id="l2613"></a>to the Dragons body as a part thereof &amp; afterwards divided <a id="l2614"></a>from it. And the western Empire hath a particular relation <a id="l2615"></a>to the watry element. For the Beast rises out of the sea &amp; <a id="l2616"></a>the Woman sits upon many waters: which waters signify the peoples <a id="l2617"></a>nations multitudes &amp; tongues over whom the Woman reigneth, <a id="l2618"></a>&amp; which compose the horns &amp; body of the Beast on whom she <a id="l2619"></a>sitteth. Her floating upon the flood &amp; sitting upon many waters <a id="l2620"></a>&amp; upon the Beast are types of one &amp; the same signification <a id="l2621"></a>&amp; represent her reigning over the flood in her way into the wilderness <a id="l2622"></a>&amp; over the many waters &amp; the Beast in the Wilderness. She fled from <a id="l2623"></a>the Dragon westward to reign at Rome the great city Babylon the city <a id="l2624"></a>upon seven hills, &amp; therefore the flood which the Dragon cast out of <a id="l2625"></a>his mouth after her is a western kingdom.</p>
<p id="par102">And as the flowing of the flood out of the Dragon's mouth signi<a id="l2626"></a>fies a division of the empire into two Empires one of which during the <a id="l2627"></a>division is represented by the Dragon &amp; the other by the flood so the <a id="l2628"></a>flying of the Woman from the remnant of her seed signifies the di<a id="l2629"></a>vision of the Church into two Churches one of which is the Woman the other <a id="l2630"></a>the remnant of her seed. When she receives two wings of a great <a id="l2631"></a>eagle she becomes distinguished into two Churches in communion with <a id="l2632"></a>one another. Vpon these wings she fled into a spiritually barren kingdom <a id="l2633"></a>represented by the wilderness. When she began to fly the Dragon cast <a id="l2634"></a>out water as a flood after her that he might cause her to be carried <a id="l2635"></a>away of the flood, that is, that by the division of the Empire he might <a id="l2636"></a>promote the division of the Church &amp; cause the Woman to separate from <a id="l2637"></a>the remnant of her seed. The earth helps her &amp; prevents the se<a id="l2638"></a>paration for a time by swallowing up the flood, but at length she <a id="l2639"></a>separates &amp; escapes into the barren wilderness, &amp; the Dragon goes <a id="l2640"></a>to make war with the remnant of her seed who keep the <a id="l2641"></a>commandments of God. And henceforward none are permitted to buy <a id="l2642"></a>&amp; sell, that is to be in communion with her &amp; the Dragon &amp; two Beasts <a id="l2643"></a>but those that are initiated in their religion by receiving the mark <a id="l2644"></a>or name of the Beast or the number of his name. The Dragon  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p66"> &lt;45r&gt; </span> persecutes first the Woman &amp; then the remnant of her seed, &amp; the <a id="l2645"></a>multitude degenerates, becomes spiritually barren &amp; receives the mark <a id="l2646"></a>of the Beast, except the 144000 who have the testimony of Iesus <a id="l2647"></a>&amp; are sealed with the name of God in their forehead, &amp; in whose <a id="l2648"></a>mouth there was found no lye. These are Gods true witnesses, &amp; <a id="l2649"></a>being the seed of the Woman with two wings are thence called <a id="l2650"></a>the two Witnesses. When the Dragon began to persecute the Woman <a id="l2651"></a>they began their testimony against him; &amp; at the same time two <a id="l2652"></a>wings  were given her to fly from him, &amp; from this division <a id="l2653"></a>made in the beginning of their  testimony &amp; continued for some time they are ever <a id="l2654"></a>after called the two Witnesses. We are not to look for two Churches <a id="l2655"></a>which always continue distinct: the denomination is taken from the <a id="l2656"></a>first division while they were yet in communion with the Woman &amp; <a id="l2657"></a>made a part of her mystical body &amp; from the two Empires in which they were seated then &amp; sometime after.. As the Beast is said to have ten <a id="l2658"></a>horns &amp; the other Beast two horns &amp; the Lamb seven horns (the <a id="l2659"></a>seven Churches of Asia) &amp; the Leopard four heads &amp; four <a id="l2660"></a>wings, &amp; the Woman two wings, not because they are always  actually divided into that number of horns &amp; <a id="l2661"></a>wings but because that was their first number: so the Witnesses <a id="l2662"></a>are called two from their first number represented by the two <a id="l2663"></a>wings of the Woman while they were a part of her mystical <a id="l2664"></a>body. And by the same figure that the Woman may be conceived <a id="l2665"></a>to keep her two wings after she is separated from the  saints <a id="l2666"></a> &amp; retired into the Western Empire, the saints after that <a id="l2667"></a>separation may keep the name of two Witnesses  wherever the remnant of the Womans seed shall be dispersed. The name of two Witnesses being <a id="l2669"></a>given them while they were a part of the Womans body they <a id="l2670"></a>retain it ever after without further regard to forms of go<a id="l2671"></a>vernment or places of aboad. These are the martyrs who are <a id="l2672"></a>mystically killed by the Dragon for not worshipping the Image of <a id="l2673"></a>the Beast, the first fruits unto God, the saints who worship in the <a id="l2674"></a>inner court of the Temple  on mount Sion &amp; on the sea of glass, <a id="l2675"></a>who by their testimony get the victory over the Beast &amp; over his <a id="l2676"></a>Image &amp; over his mark &amp; over the number of his name, the holy <a id="l2677"></a>city troden under foot by the Gentiles, the Saints with whom the <a id="l2678"></a>Beast makes war &amp; whom he overcomes &amp; kills in the streets of <a id="l2679"></a>the great city, &amp; the martyrs of Iesus with whose blood the <a id="l2680"></a>Whore is drunken. And the Beast when opposed to the two Witnesses, may be taken in a large sense, so as to include all his worshippers, that is, all whose names are not written in the book of life.</p>
<p id="par103">The occasion of the division of the Empire into two <a id="l2681"></a>parts  was the building of Constantinople by Constantine <a id="l2682"></a>the great. It was founded in November A.C. 338 &amp; dedicated in May A.C. 330, &amp; endowed  with a Senate &amp; privileges <a id="l2683"></a>like those at Rome, &amp; made  the metropolis of all the <a id="l2684"></a>eastern part of the Empire as Rome had hitherto been of <a id="l2685"></a>all the Empire &amp; was henceforward of all the western part <a id="l2686"></a>thereof. By this division of the Empire between two <a id="l2687"></a>imperial cities the Woman received two wings of a great <a id="l2688"></a>eagle that she might fly into the Wilderness &amp; then the <a id="l2689"></a>two Witnesses began their testimony. At the death of <a id="l2690"></a>Constantine the great A.C. 337 the Dragon cast out of <a id="l2691"></a>his mouth water as a flood after the Woman to cause <a id="l2692"></a>her to be carried away of the flood. ffor the Empire at <a id="l2693"></a>that time became divided between the sons of Constan<a id="l2694"></a>tine, his second son Constantius reigning over the <a id="l2695"></a>east &amp; his other two sons Constantine &amp; Constans reigning in the <a id="l2696"></a>west. But Constantine was quickly slain &amp; then his brother Constans <a id="l2697"></a>reigned over all the west, making Rome his imperial seat as Con<a id="l2698"></a>stantinople was the imperial seat of  Constantius. And this division of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p67"> &lt;46r&gt; </span> the Empire tended to make the like division of the Church. For the <a id="l2699"></a>Bishop of Rome began now to claim the universal bishopric &amp; his claim <a id="l2700"></a>was submitted unto by the western Churches &amp; supported by the western <a id="l2701"></a>Empire against the eastern Churches &amp; almost made a schism between <a id="l2702"></a>them. For in the year 341 this Bishop began to receive appeals from <a id="l2703"></a>the Councils of the Greek Church &amp; proudly summoned the Bishops <a id="l2704"></a>of that Church to appear before him in a Council at Rome, but <a id="l2705"></a>was stoutly opposed &amp; reprimanded by those Bishops for his ambition. <a id="l2706"></a>Then by the favour of the western Emperor Constans he prevailed <a id="l2707"></a>to have a Council summoned by Imperial authority out of both <a id="l2708"></a>Empires to meet at Serdica in the year 347. About eighty eastern <a id="l2709"></a>bishops came to Serdica, but finding that matters were prejudged <a id="l2710"></a>by the western bishops in favour of the pretended authority of the <a id="l2711"></a>Bishop of Rome, &amp; that they could not come to the Council <a id="l2712"></a>without communicating with Bishops who stood excommunicated by <a id="l2713"></a>them, they went back, &amp; the remaining part of the Council de<a id="l2714"></a>creed appeals from all the Churches to the Bishop of Rome, &amp; <a id="l2715"></a>thereby gave him the supremacy over all the west. For the <a id="l2716"></a>western churches submitted to that decree. And these proceedings <a id="l2717"></a>almost made a schism between the Churches of the two Empires <a id="l2718"></a>the people of the western Churches beginning now to avoid <a id="l2719"></a>the communion of the of the eastern but those of the eastern not yet <a id="l2720"></a>avoiding the communion of the western. And this tendency to a <a id="l2721"></a>schism is represented by the endeavour of the flood to carry away <a id="l2722"></a>the Woman, &amp; her new dominion in the west is represented by <a id="l2723"></a>her floting upon the waters. Thus did the Woman soon after <a id="l2724"></a>she had received two wings of a great Eagle, begin to fly into <a id="l2725"></a>the wilderness. For the western Churches headed by the Church of <a id="l2726"></a>Rome are the Woman reigning there.</p>
<p id="par104">But the force of the flood to carry away the Woman was <a id="l2727"></a>but of short continuance. For Magnentius slew Constans &amp; suc<a id="l2728"></a>ceeded him in the West A.C. 350, &amp; within a year or two was <a id="l2729"></a>conquered by  Constantius. And by that victory of the <a id="l2730"></a>eastern Empire over the western, the earth or eastern Empire <a id="l2731"></a>opened her mouth &amp; swallowed up the flood &amp; thereby retarded <a id="l2732"></a>her flight for a time. For by the union of the two Empires a <a id="l2733"></a>stop was put to the impending schism, &amp; the Woman with her <a id="l2734"></a>two eagles wings continued to represent the undivided Church <a id="l2735"></a>of the whole Empire for some time longer, &amp; the new <a id="l2736"></a>dominion of the Bishop of Rome was suspended during that time, <a id="l2737"></a>the western Bishops being forced to allow the authority of the <a id="l2738"></a>eastern Churches &amp; Councils over their own members in matters judicial <a id="l2739"></a>without appeal to the Bishop of Rome.</p>
<p id="par105">By the same victory of Constantius over Magnentius <a id="l2740"></a>the Beast was wounded to death with a sword &amp; ceased to be <a id="l2741"></a>till he revived &amp; ascended out of the abyss, both Empires becoming <a id="l2742"></a>united under Constantius &amp; his successors Iulian &amp; Iovian till the <a id="l2743"></a>reign of Valentinian &amp; Valens. Between them the Empire became <a id="l2744"></a>again divided A.C. 364, &amp; by this division the deadly wound was <a id="l2745"></a>healed &amp; the Beast revived &amp; soon after rose out of the sea, &amp; the <a id="l2746"></a>Woman by a tendency to a new schism continued her flight into the <a id="l2747"></a>Wilderness &amp; the Dragon went to make war with the remnant of her seed.. Then by the death of Valens the Empire became united <a id="l2748"></a>again under Gratian the successor of Valentinian for about five <a id="l2749"></a>months, &amp; by the next division which was between Gratian &amp; Theodosius <a id="l2750"></a>A.C. 378,  the Woman separated from the remnant of her seed, &amp; the ten horned Beast rose out of the sea <a id="l2752"></a>to succeed the Dragon in the west, &amp; the two horned Beast rose out of the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p68"> &lt;47r&gt; </span> earth to succeed her  woman in the east &amp; by the influence of  this Beast the Dragon made war with the remnant of her seed.. And at the same time the Bishop <a id="l2753"></a>of Rome recovered the universal Bishopric over all the west &amp; <a id="l2754"></a>began to govern the Churches of the Western Empire by Vicars <a id="l2755"></a>&amp; to write decretal Epistles; &amp; by this dominion she began <a id="l2756"></a>to sit upon the Beast &amp; to change times &amp; laws. And in those days <a id="l2757"></a>the invocation of saints overspread all the Churches, &amp; thereby she <a id="l2758"></a>became the Whore of Babylon.</p>
<p id="par106">Theodosius reigned in the east &amp; Gratian with his his young brother <a id="l2759"></a>Valentinian in the west. Maximus compassed the death of Gratian <a id="l2760"></a>&amp; made Valentinian fly into the east &amp; succeeded them. Theodosius <a id="l2761"></a>A.C. 388 conquered Maximus &amp; restored Valentinian &amp; reigned <a id="l2762"></a>with him three years in the west &amp; returned into the east A.C. <a id="l2763"></a>391. Eugenius A.C. 392 compassed the death of Valentinian <a id="l2764"></a>&amp; succeeded him in the western Empire, but Theodosius made <a id="l2765"></a>his younger son Honorius Emperor of the West in the room <a id="l2766"></a>of Valentinian, conquered Eugenius A.C. 394, died three or <a id="l2767"></a>four months after; &amp; by his last will &amp; testament left the <a id="l2768"></a>Empire divided between his two sons Arcadius &amp; Honorius. <a id="l2769"></a>After which the two Empires were united no more. By con<a id="l2770"></a>quering the West &amp; resigning the conquest to Honorius the <a id="l2771"></a>Dragon gave the Beast his power &amp; throne. The Beast revived <a id="l2772"></a>before he could ascend out of the sea &amp; ascended before <a id="l2773"></a>the Dragon who stood upon the land could give him his <a id="l2774"></a>power &amp; throne. These were three distinct successive acts <a id="l2775"></a>&amp; imply three successive divisions of the Empire &amp; can <a id="l2776"></a>agree to no other then the three last divisions, those three <a id="l2777"></a>to which we have applyed them. Theodosius by conquering Max<a id="l2778"></a>imus reigned over both Empires, over the east with Arcadius <a id="l2779"></a>&amp; over the West with Valentinian &amp; Honorius. Thus the <a id="l2780"></a>Empire was united under him in the last seven years of <a id="l2781"></a>his reign &amp; yet at the same  time divided between Arca<a id="l2782"></a>dius who was Emperor of the East &amp; Valentinian &amp; Hono<a id="l2783"></a>rius who were successive Emperors of the West. The Dragon <a id="l2784"></a>therefore in some respect reigned over the whole Empire <a id="l2785"></a>even after the Beast was risen, &amp; this reign is to be re<a id="l2786"></a>ferred to his seventh head. And when Theodosius by his <a id="l2787"></a>last will &amp; testament left the Empire divided between his <a id="l2788"></a>sons &amp; was succeeded in the eastern Empire by his eldest <a id="l2789"></a>son Arcadius, the Dragon gave the Beast his western throne <a id="l2790"></a>&amp; power. And now the Beast being revived &amp; risen out of <a id="l2791"></a>the abyss &amp; having received the Dragons ancient throne <a id="l2792"></a>we are to expect the reign of the ten horns. For they <a id="l2793"></a>were to receive power as kings at the same time with the Beast, <a id="l2794"></a>that is, at the same time that the Dragon gave the Beast his <a id="l2795"></a>power &amp; throne &amp; great authority. And accordingly the Western <a id="l2796"></a>Empire became divided into ten kingdoms in the reign of the <a id="l2797"></a>Emperors Arcadius &amp; Honorius, as we shewed in our commen<a id="l2798"></a>tary upon Daniels fourth Beast.</p>
<p id="par107">Before the Woman received two wings of a great Eagle <a id="l2799"></a><em class="underline">there was war in heaven. Michael &amp; his Angels fought against the <a id="l2800"></a>Dragon, &amp; the Dragon fought &amp; his Angels &amp; prevailed not, neither was <a id="l2801"></a>their place found any more in heaven. And the great Dragon was <a id="l2802"></a>cast out, that old Serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan which deceiveth <a id="l2803"></a>the whole world, he was cast out into the earth &amp; his Angels <a id="l2804"></a>were cast out with him. And Iohn heard a loud voice saying <a id="l2805"></a>in heaven, Now is come salvation &amp; strength &amp; the kingdome of <a id="l2806"></a>our God &amp; the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren <a id="l2807"></a>is cast down who accused them before our God day &amp; night. And they</em>  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p69"> &lt;48r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">overcame him by the blood of the Lamb &amp; by the word of their <a id="l2808"></a>testimony, &amp; they loved not their lives unto the death</em>. This is a very <a id="l2809"></a>plain description of a great conflict between the Roman heathen <a id="l2810"></a>Empire &amp; the army of Christ. For Michael &amp; his Angels are Christ <a id="l2811"></a>&amp; his army, such an army as was accused by the Dragon day &amp; night <a id="l2812"></a>&amp; loved not their lives unto the death, such an army as overcame <a id="l2813"></a>the Dragon by the blood of the Lamb, &amp; by the word of their testi<a id="l2814"></a>mony; that is, an army of martyrs &amp; confessors. And this war <a id="l2815"></a>between Michael &amp; the Dragon was managed on the Dragon's <a id="l2816"></a>part by accusing &amp; persecuting the Christians &amp; putting them to <a id="l2817"></a>death for their religion, &amp; on the Christians part by confessing <a id="l2818"></a>&amp; testifying the truth of their religion &amp; persisting in their <a id="l2819"></a>confession &amp; testimony without fearing to lose their lives for <a id="l2820"></a>the same. And by this conflict the Dragon that old Ser<a id="l2821"></a>pent called the Devil &amp; Satan, that is, the heathen Roman <a id="l2822"></a>Empire in respect of its religion, was overcome &amp; cast out of <a id="l2823"></a>heaven to the earth &amp; was succeeded in the throne by a new <a id="l2824"></a>kingdom called the kingdom of God. ffor the conflict ended <a id="l2825"></a>with a voice from heaven saying: <em class="underline">Now is come salvation &amp; <a id="l2826"></a>strength &amp; the</em> KINGDOM OF OUR GOD, <em class="underline">for the accuser of <a id="l2827"></a>our brethren is cast down</em>. And all this can agree to nothing <a id="l2828"></a>else then the last of the heathen persecutions which began in <a id="l2829"></a>the reign of Dioclesian A.C. 302 &amp; lasted almost two years <a id="l2830"></a>over all the Roman Empire &amp; ten years together with great <a id="l2831"></a>violence over all the eastern part thereof &amp; was greater <a id="l2832"></a>then all the former persecutions taken together, &amp; which <a id="l2833"></a>ended in the ruin of the heathen Roman Empire &amp; the <a id="l2834"></a>setting up of a Christian Empire in its room under Constan<a id="l2835"></a>tine the great.</p>
<p id="par108">The same revolution is predicted also by the Vision of <a id="l2836"></a>the Woman who <em class="underline">being</em> great <em class="underline">with child cried travelling in <a id="l2837"></a>birth &amp; pained to be delivered</em>, &amp; by the Dragon's <em class="underline">drawing <a id="l2838"></a>the third part of the stars of heaven with his tail &amp; casting <a id="l2839"></a>them to the earth</em>, and <em class="underline">standing before the Woman ready <a id="l2840"></a>to be delivered for to devour her child so soon as it was <a id="l2841"></a>born</em>, &amp; by her <em class="underline">bringing forth a Man-child who was to rule <a id="l2842"></a>all nations with a rod of iron &amp; was caught up unto God &amp; <a id="l2843"></a>his throne</em> from the jaws of the Dragon. ffor since this <a id="l2844"></a>Parable ends with the flight of the Woman into the Wilder<a id="l2845"></a>ness, &amp; that of the war between Michael &amp; the Dragon ends <a id="l2846"></a>also with the same flight, both the Parables ending at the <a id="l2847"></a>same time must be synchronal &amp; concerne the same revolution <a id="l2848"></a>of the Empire. ffor describing &amp; pointing out this grand revolution <a id="l2849"></a>more clearly &amp; fully the description is repeated. The Woman <a id="l2850"></a>travelling in birth &amp; pained to be delivered signifies the Church <a id="l2851"></a>in affliction by a great persecution which ended in the birth of <a id="l2852"></a>a Christian kingdom, &amp; therefore was Dioclesian's persecution. <a id="l2853"></a>And the same persecution is signified by the Dragons drawing <a id="l2854"></a>the third part of the stars of heaven &amp; casting them to the <a id="l2855"></a>earth. This act shews that the Dragon is the persecutor, &amp; <a id="l2856"></a>the other of the Womans being pained in child-birth, that <a id="l2857"></a>she is the person persecuted. The third part of the stars of <a id="l2858"></a>heaven, or stars of the third part of the Christian world, are <a id="l2859"></a>martyrs &amp; confessors of the provinces of the Greek Empire where  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p70"> &lt;49r&gt; </span> the persecution was very vehement &amp; lasted ten years to<a id="l2860"></a>gether, being carried on by Dioclesian Galerius &amp; Maximi<a id="l2861"></a>nus successively, besides what the Christians of that part of <a id="l2862"></a>the Empire suffered afterwards under Licinius. For in the <a id="l2863"></a>western part of the Empire where Herculius Constantius &amp; <a id="l2864"></a>Constantine reigned successively the persecution lasted scarce <a id="l2865"></a>two full years being stopt by Constantius, &amp; the Martyrs <a id="l2866"></a>&amp; Confessors were so few &amp; made so small an appearance <a id="l2867"></a>that before the end of two years there were pillars set up <a id="l2868"></a>by the heathens in several parts of Spain, with inscriptions <a id="l2869"></a>signifying that the superstition of Christ &amp; name of Christi<a id="l2870"></a>ans were every where extinguished. In Dacia &amp; such other <a id="l2871"></a>Provinces as had newly revolted from the Roman Empire &amp; <a id="l2872"></a>make another third part, there was no persecution at <a id="l2873"></a>all. The Man-child which the Woman brought forth <a id="l2874"></a>is not a single person but a kingdom as Isaias interprets <a id="l2875"></a>the type. ffor the Woman is a body polytick &amp; the child <a id="l2876"></a>must be a body of the same kind with the mother. And <a id="l2877"></a>this kingdom was Christian because it was the son of the <a id="l2878"></a>Woman &amp; was to rule all nations with a rod of iron, which <a id="l2879"></a>in this prophesy is the scepter of Christ's kingdom. The perse<a id="l2880"></a>cution began by an Edict for demolishing the Churches &amp; <a id="l2881"></a>burning the sacred books throughout the Empire A.C. 302, <a id="l2882"></a>&amp; the Man-child was born in the western part of the <a id="l2883"></a>Empire by the victory of Constantine the great over <a id="l2884"></a>Maxentius in the end of the persecution A.C. 312. And <a id="l2885"></a>six years after by the victory of Constantine over Licinius a hea<a id="l2886"></a>then persecuting Emperor who reigned in the east, the Man-child <a id="l2887"></a>was caught up to the throne of the whole Empire. And the <a id="l2888"></a>Dragon at the same time being cast out of heaven by <a id="l2889"></a>Michael began to come down among the inhabitants of the earth <a id="l2890"></a>&amp; sea with great wrath knowing that he hath but a short <a id="l2891"></a>time; that is, the heathens being cast out of their old throne <a id="l2892"></a>flowed into the Christian Churches of the earth &amp; sea, making <a id="l2893"></a>an outward shew &amp; profession of the Christian religion for <a id="l2894"></a>temporal ends but retaining their vicious lives &amp; heathen <a id="l2895"></a>principles &amp; inclinations to superstition, &amp; thereby they  <a id="l2896"></a>soon corrupted the Christian religion &amp; filled it full of the <a id="l2897"></a>vices &amp; superstitions of the heathens, making hast to do this <a id="l2898"></a>because the Dragon had but a short time to reign among <a id="l2899"></a>the Christians before he should be cast into the bottomless <a id="l2900"></a>pit. And all the short time of the Dragons wrath, the saints <a id="l2901"></a>testify against him. ffor in all persecutions the saints have the <a id="l2902"></a>testimony of Iesus. They begin their testimony therefore when <a id="l2903"></a>he begins to persecute the Woman &amp; two wings are given her <a id="l2904"></a>to fly  into the wilderness. And when she separates from <a id="l2905"></a>them &amp; flyes to the great city Babylon, they are sealed &amp; measured <a id="l2906"></a>&amp; begin to prophesy in the second Temple, &amp; are there represented by <a id="l2907"></a>two Candlesticks of olive-tree, &amp; worship in the inner Court upon <a id="l2908"></a>mount Sion &amp; upon the Sea of glass, singing there a new song, that is <a id="l2909"></a>prophesying in a new state of the Church, while the nations tread under <a id="l2910"></a>foot the holy City &amp; set up the abomination of the Wilderness in the outward <a id="l2911"></a>court instead of the daily worship, which by killing those that would not  worship the Image of the Beast &amp; excommunicating those <a id="l2913"></a>that would not receive his mark was now taken away in that Court to <a id="l2914"></a>make room for the Man of Sin &amp; the worship of the dead in an outward <a id="l2915"></a>form of Church government.</p>

<p id="par109">The Dragon &amp; Beast being the subject of the Prophesy &amp; signifying <a id="l2918"></a>the Roman Empire sometimes united &amp; sometimes divided &amp; the relation <a id="l2919"></a>which they have to one another &amp; to the Empire with its parts being under<a id="l2920"></a>stood, it will not be difficult to describe their heads. The four first <a id="l2921"></a>are the four horsmen which the four Beasts standing towards the <a id="l2922"></a>four winds of heaven call Iohn to come &amp; see, &amp; which therefore <a id="l2923"></a>stood in the regions of the Beasts, the first horsman to the east <a id="l2924"></a>the second to the west the third to the south &amp; the fourth to <a id="l2925"></a>the north.

The encampment is described in the book of Numbers <a id="l2935"></a>&amp; the Iews keep a tradition of the forms of the four standards. <a id="l2936"></a>Every horsman therefore with the horse he rides upon <em class="underline">&amp; the Beast</em> <a id="l2937"></a> which appears in the same region with him, is a <a id="l2938"></a>fit embleme of an Emperor with his Empire &amp; his army under <a id="l2939"></a>its standard. And thus the four horsmen with their Beasts <a id="l2940"></a>very fitly represent four reigns or dynasties of Emperors.</p>
<p id="par110">The first Emperors were Italians called the twelve <a id="l2941"></a>Cæsars. Of these there were two Dynasties, the first of the <a id="l2942"></a>family of Iulius Cæsar which lasted till the death of Nero, <a id="l2943"></a>the next of the family of Vespasian which lasted till the <a id="l2944"></a>death of Domitian the last of the twelve Cæsars.

<p id="par114">The fift Dynasty was of several Emperors reigning together <a id="l3048"></a>&amp; sharing the Empire amongst them by common consent. It <a id="l3049"></a>began with the reign of Dioclesian &amp; Herculeus. Dioclesian <a id="l3050"></a>Galerius Maximinus &amp;, Licinius reigned successively over the eastern part <a id="l3051"></a>of the Empire &amp; Herculeus Constantius &amp; Constantine the great <a id="l3052"></a>over the western, &amp; these Emperors had for the most part <a id="l3053"></a>two  Cæsars under them. This Dynasty the Romans dis<a id="l3054"></a>tinguished from the reigns of the former Emperors by dating <a id="l3055"></a>from the beginning of it an Æra called the Æra of Diocle<a id="l3056"></a>sian &amp; the Æra of the Martyrs. For this Æra commenced <a id="l3057"></a>with the reign of Dioclesian A.C. 284 Aug. 29, &amp; was in use <a id="l3058"></a>till the Æra of Dionysius prevailed, that is, about 250 <a id="l3059"></a>years. Scaliger saith it is still in use among the Christi<a id="l3060"></a>ans of Africk &amp; Æthiopia. This Æra I consider as a suffici<a id="l3061"></a>ent argument of the beginning of a new Dynasty, the <a id="l3062"></a>Romans looking upon Dioclesian as the restorer of their <a id="l3063"></a>Empire. ffor in the fourth Dynasty it was in great danger <a id="l3064"></a>of falling but was restored by Dioclesian &amp; his colleagues <a id="l3065"></a>to its former greatness &amp; tranquility &amp; enlarged by the <a id="l3066"></a>addition of Assyria &amp; the five Provinces beyond Tigris.</p>
<p id="par115">The sixt Dynasty began with the victory of Constantine <a id="l3067"></a>the great over Licinius whereby the Empire was again  <a id="l3068"></a>reduced to a monarchical form. This Dynasty continued in <a id="l3069"></a>the family of Constantine  till the death of Iulian <a id="l3070"></a>the apostate, after whom reigned Iovian seven months, &amp; <a id="l3071"></a>then the Empire became divided by degrees into the Greek &amp; <a id="l3072"></a>Latin Empires, which was the seventh Dynasty.</p>
<p id="par116">In the four first Dynasties the Roman Emperors represented <a id="l3073"></a>by four horsmen with their armies under four standards had various <a id="l3074"></a>warrs, all which are  in the beginning of the repetition of <a id="l3075"></a>the Prophesy at the opening of the Temple in heaven, represented <a id="l3076"></a>by lightnings &amp; voices &amp; thundrings &amp; an earthquake &amp; great hail. <a id="l3077"></a>The chief character of the fift Dynasty was Dioclesians perse<a id="l3078"></a>cution from whence his Æra was called the Æra of the Martyrs, &amp; <a id="l3079"></a>this is represented at the opening of the fift seal by the souls <a id="l3080"></a>of the Martyrs under the altar &amp; in the repetition of the <a id="l3081"></a>Prophesy by the pains of a woman in travail &amp; by the Dragons <a id="l3082"></a>tail drawing the third part of the stars of heaven (or stars of <a id="l3083"></a>the Greek Empire) &amp; casting them to the earth. The chief character <a id="l3084"></a>of the sixt Dynasty was the dethroning of heathenism &amp; en<a id="l3085"></a>throning of Christianity. And this is represented at the opening <a id="l3086"></a>of the sixt seale by a description of the end of the heathen <a id="l3087"></a>world,  in the repetition of the Prophesy by the casting of the <a id="l3088"></a>Dragon that old Serpent out heaven &amp; exalting the Man-child up  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p75"> &lt;54r&gt; </span> to the throne. The Dragon reigned in heaven till the end <a id="l3089"></a>of the fift Dynasty, &amp; then came down &amp; began a new reign <a id="l3090"></a>amongst the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea, which new reign <a id="l3091"></a>is the sixt Dynasty &amp; lasted only till the Beast rose out of the <a id="l3092"></a>sea &amp; received the Dragons throne.</p>
<p id="par117">In this sixt reign the Empire became divided between <a id="l3093"></a>the sons of Constantine the great into the eastern &amp; western <a id="l3094"></a>Empires, but after a few years the western Empire was <a id="l3095"></a>conquered &amp; mystically slain by the sword of the eastern, <a id="l3096"></a>&amp; ceased untill the reign of Valentinian &amp; Valens. And <a id="l3097"></a>in respect of the time when the western Empire represented <a id="l3098"></a>by the Beast was extinct it is said that the Beast was &amp; is not <a id="l3099"></a>&amp; shall ascend out of the abyss &amp; go into perdition &amp; that the Beast was &amp; is not and yet is, &amp; that <a id="l3100"></a>five kings are fallen &amp; one is &amp; the other is not yet come &amp; when <a id="l3101"></a>he cometh he must continue a short space &amp; that the Beast had a mortal wound in one of his heads &amp; revived. <a id="l3102"></a>He revived by the division of the Empire between Valentinian &amp; <a id="l3103"></a>Valens, &amp; being now alive he ascended out of the abyss or sea at <a id="l3104"></a>the next division of the Empire which was between Gratian &amp; Theo<a id="l3105"></a>dosius, &amp; at the last division which was between the sons of The<a id="l3106"></a>odosius he received the Dragons throne &amp; power &amp; became the <a id="l3107"></a>eighth &amp; of the seven. ffrom the time of his ascending out of the <a id="l3108"></a>abyss  untill his going into perdition he was to continue a short <a id="l3109"></a>space &amp; this was his seventh reign or Dynasty, &amp; after he was <a id="l3110"></a>ascended the Dragon gave him his throne &amp; power &amp; great <a id="l3111"></a>authority &amp; this act began a new reign which is the latter part <a id="l3112"></a>of the seventh &amp; is therefore called the eighth &amp; of the <a id="l3113"></a>seven. The seven reigns begin with the opening of the seven <a id="l3114"></a>seales &amp; the eighth with the sounding of the Trumpets. ffor <a id="l3115"></a>by these periods the Roman Empire is divided into Dynasties; &amp; the <a id="l3116"></a>period of the Trumpets is the eighth &amp; of the seven being continued <a id="l3117"></a>in the period of the seventh seale.</p>
<p id="par118">This eighth period is by the sounding of the seven Trumpets <a id="l3118"></a>subdivided into six intervalls of time, but these make not changes in <a id="l3119"></a>the reign of the Dragon &amp; Beast common to them both before the <a id="l3120"></a>sounding of the last Trumpet, &amp; therefore there are no more <a id="l3121"></a>common Dynasties then eight. At the sounding of the last Trumpet <a id="l3122"></a>an end is put to the reign of them both: for the mighty Angel <a id="l3123"></a><em class="underline">sware that there should be time no longer but in the voice of the <a id="l3124"></a>seventh Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God <a id="l3125"></a>shall be finished</em>, &amp; when he sounds <em class="underline">the kingdoms of this world <a id="l3126"></a>become the kingdoms of our Lord &amp; of his Christ who reign for ever <a id="l3127"></a>&amp; ever</em>. He sounds to the battel between the army on white <a id="l3128"></a>horses in heaven &amp; the army of the Beast &amp; kings of the earth <a id="l3129"></a>in which battel the Beast &amp; ffals Prophet are taken &amp; cast alive <a id="l3130"></a>into the lake of fire &amp; the Dragon into the bottomless pit: &amp; <a id="l3131"></a>here ends the reign of the eighth king. His reign is therefore by <a id="l3132"></a>the sounding of the seven Trumpets distinguished only into six intervalls <a id="l3133"></a>of time, &amp; these intervalls being thrice repeated, once by the <a id="l3134"></a>sounding of the seven Trumpets, once by the voices of the seven <a id="l3135"></a>thunders &amp; once by the pouring out of the seven vials of wrath, <a id="l3136"></a>answer to the mysterious number of the Beast 666. What  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p76"> &lt;55r&gt; </span> follows concerning the thousand years or day or judgment <a id="l3137"></a>&amp; the kingdom of heaven, is to be conceived not sealed <a id="l3138"></a>up under any of the seven seals but written on <a id="l3139"></a>the backside of the book.</p>
<p id="par119">In the time of the sixt reign or head, when the <a id="l3140"></a>Beast had been &amp; was not &amp; was to ascend out of the <a id="l3141"></a>abyss, the ten kings had received no kingdom but were <a id="l3142"></a>to receive power as kings about the same time with the <a id="l3143"></a>Beast. This Beast received the Dragons throne at the <a id="l3144"></a>death of Theodosius A.C. 395 Ian. 13, &amp; therefore the <a id="l3145"></a>ten horns were now to receive power as kings. And <a id="l3146"></a>accordingly the western Empire began presently to break <a id="l3147"></a>into ten kingdoms.  For so soon as the Emperor was <a id="l3149"></a>dead, Ruffin invited the barbarous nations on both sides the <a id="l3150"></a>Danube to invade the Romans, &amp; the Visigoths thereupon <a id="l3151"></a>rose from their seats in Thrace &amp; the Vandals from theirs <a id="l3152"></a>in Pannonia &amp; the Hunns Alans &amp; Ostrogoths came over <a id="l3153"></a>the frozen Danube the next winter, &amp; the Suevians in<a id="l3154"></a>vaded Rhætia, &amp; after various wars, the Visigoths invaded <a id="l3155"></a>Italy &amp; went thence into Gallia, the Hunns seated themselves <a id="l3156"></a>in Pannonia with the Ostrogoths under them, the Vandals, the <a id="l3157"></a>Alans in two bodies, the Suevians &amp; the Burgundians invaded <a id="l3158"></a>Gallia &amp; Spain &amp; there erected five kingdoms. And upon these <a id="l3159"></a>commotions the Salian Franks rose up in arms &amp; founded <a id="l3160"></a>the present kingdom of France, &amp; the Britains separated <a id="l3161"></a>from the Empire &amp; set up a government of their own, <a id="l3162"></a>&amp; the remainder of the western Empire made up the <a id="l3163"></a>number of ten kings. Most of these kings received power <a id="l3164"></a>as kings upon the death of Theodosius &amp; all of them <a id="l3165"></a>within the space of 12 or 13 years after, the Empire <a id="l3166"></a>breaking into these ten kingdoms by one continued series <a id="l3167"></a>of war which began at the sounding of the first Trumpet <a id="l3168"></a>&amp; shifted from east to west at the sounding of the second. <a id="l3169"></a> Vpon the sounding of the first Trumpet they began to receive power as kings, upon the sounding of the second they were distinctly formed into ten kingdoms seated in the western Empire, <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> at the sounding of the third they are represented by rivers &amp; <a id="l3170"></a>fountains of water.  As the <a id="l3171"></a>Leopard which rose out of the sea with four heads &amp; four <a id="l3172"></a>wings represents the Greek Empire which was first monar<a id="l3173"></a>chical &amp; then brake into four great kingdoms, so the Beast <a id="l3174"></a>which rose out of the Sea with ten horns represents the <a id="l3175"></a>western Empire first in a monarchical form &amp; presently <a id="l3176"></a>after divided into these ten kingdoms. And as the four heads <a id="l3177"></a>&amp; wings of the Leopard &amp; four horns of the He-goat <a id="l3178"></a>constantly represent the kingdoms into which the Greek Empire was <a id="l3179"></a>divided whether more or fewer then four, the number four  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p77"> &lt;56r&gt; </span> respecting only the first division: so the ten horns constantly <a id="l3180"></a>represent the kingdoms into which the Latine Empire is at any <a id="l3181"></a>time divided be they more or fewer then ten, the number ten <a id="l3182"></a>respecting only the first division.  And for this reason they are called the ten <a id="l3184"></a>horns even after the little horn of Daniel's fourth Beast had rooted <a id="l3185"></a>up three of them. They became of one mind that is of one <a id="l3186"></a>religion &amp; by uniting in religion &amp; submitting to the Womans <a id="l3187"></a>ecclesiastical authority they agreed &amp; gave their kingdom to <a id="l3188"></a>compose the Beast.</p>
<p id="par120">And because the kingdoms over which the Woman reigneth <a id="l3189"></a>may be considered either as the ten kings in respect of their first <a id="l3190"></a>rise or as the seven which remained after three of the ten were <a id="l3191"></a>rooted up, they are also represented by the seven mountains on <a id="l3192"></a>which the Woman sitteth. ffor the heads of the Beast have a dou<a id="l3193"></a>ble signification. They are seven mountains on which the woman <a id="l3194"></a>sitteth, that is seven dominions over which she reigneth, &amp; they <a id="l3195"></a>are also seven [successive] kings five of which were fallen be<a id="l3196"></a>fore she began her reign.</p>
<p id="par121">Some have recconed the Greek Empire amongst the <a id="l3197"></a>horns of the Beast. For as the ten horns are ten kings which agree <a id="l3198"></a>&amp; give the power &amp; strength to the Beast so the Dragon gave <a id="l3199"></a>the Beast his power &amp; throne &amp; all the world wondred after him &amp; <a id="l3200"></a>power was given him over all kindreds &amp; tongues &amp; nations <a id="l3201"></a>&amp; all that dwell on the earth worshipped him whose names <a id="l3202"></a>were not written in the book of life. But its to be observed <a id="l3203"></a>that after it was said that the Dragon gave the Beast his <a id="l3204"></a>power &amp; throne &amp; that all the world wondred after him, it <a id="l3205"></a>is added in the next words that <em class="underline">they worshipped the Dragon <a id="l3206"></a>which gave power to the Beast, &amp; they worshipped the Beast <a id="l3207"></a>saying, Who is like unto the Beast? Who is able to make <a id="l3208"></a>war with him</em>? For by these words the Dragon &amp; Beast, <a id="l3209"></a>or Greek &amp; Latine Empires, are atill distinguished &amp; con<a id="l3210"></a>sidered apart. Yet the power of the Beast became uni<a id="l3211"></a>versal in respect of his worship. ffor after he was mortally <a id="l3212"></a>wounded &amp;  rose from the dead, the two-horned Beast <a id="l3213"></a>became his Priest, consecrated him a God, &amp; caused the eastern <a id="l3214"></a>nations to make an image to him, &amp; to worship him &amp; his <a id="l3215"></a>image, &amp; wonder after him, but gave him no temporal <a id="l3216"></a>dominion over them.</p>

<h2 id="hd16" class="cent">Chap. VI. <a id="l3217"></a><br>The Prophesy of the Epistles to <a id="l3218"></a>the seven Churches explained.</h2>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p79"> &lt;57r&gt; </span>


<p id="par122">The Prophesy of the Apocalypse neare the beginning thereof <a id="l3222"></a>relates chiefly to the first ages of Christianity &amp; neare the end <a id="l3223"></a>to the last. The first six chapters treat very largely of the <a id="l3224"></a>times preceding the great Apostasy &amp; the five next treat <a id="l3225"></a>largely of the reign of that Apostasy &amp; briefly of its fall. <a id="l3226"></a>Then follows a repetition of the whole &amp; the twelft chapter <a id="l3227"></a>treats briefly of its rise, the five next treat largely of its reign <a id="l3228"></a>the two next very largely of its fall &amp; the three last as <a id="l3229"></a>largely of the times after its fall. And according to this method <a id="l3230"></a>of the Prophesy the Epistles to the seven Churches must respect <a id="l3231"></a>the first ages of Christianity.</p>
<p id="par123">These Churches are literally the particular churches in Ephesus, <a id="l3232"></a>Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardius, Philadelphia &amp; Laodicea, &amp; the <a id="l3233"></a>Epistles written to them as particular churches  may be taken in <a id="l3234"></a>a litteral sense concerning such things as happened to them in <a id="l3235"></a>the first ages. The false Apostles in Ephesus  may be Cerinthus &amp; such <a id="l3236"></a>others as taught false doctrines there. The Nicolaitans may be those <a id="l3237"></a> in which the mystery of iniquity began to work, who besides their pretensions to knowlege falsly so called taught the dissolution of marriage &amp; the common use of weomen pretending the authority of Nicolas one of the first seven Deacons, &amp; made the Eucharist an abominable sacrifice to their fals Gods, such as were Simon &amp; Helena.. The Woman Ie<a id="l3239"></a>zabel may be one of the weomen of Montanus who pretended to <a id="l3240"></a>the spirit of prophesy &amp; spread his doctrine in Thyatira or some other earlier woman among the Nicolaitans. The martyr <a id="l3241"></a>Antipas may be some eminent Christian who was slain in Pergamus <a id="l3242"></a>before Iohn received this prophesy. But in a mystical sense the seven <a id="l3243"></a>Churches of these cities are joyntly &amp; severally types of the Church <a id="l3244"></a>Catholick, &amp; signify the same thing with the seven Candlesticks in <a id="l3245"></a>the Temple &amp; with the seven horns of the Lamb. As the lamps of the <a id="l3246"></a>Candlesticks illuminate the whole Temple, so the Angels or teachers <a id="l3247"></a>of these Churches illuminate the Church catholick. They were chosen <a id="l3248"></a>to be joyntly the Metropolis of the Church catholick from whence <a id="l3249"></a>the light of the gospel went forth into all the earth above thirty <a id="l3250"></a>years together under the government &amp; teaching of Iohn &amp; a long <a id="l3251"></a>time after under  the government &amp; teaching of his disciples <a id="l3252"></a>&amp; their successors. And Epistles directed to the Angels or teachers of <a id="l3253"></a>the Metropolis may respect the whole Church. And as the seven heads <a id="l3254"></a>of the Beast relate to seven successive periods of the Roman Empire <a id="l3255"></a>so the Epistles directed to the seven churches of Asia may relate to seven successive periods <a id="l3256"></a>of the Church catholic under that Metropolis.</p>
<p id="par124">For the church catholick is in this prophesy represented by the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p80"> &lt;58r&gt; </span> woman in heaven cloathed with the Sun &amp; having the Moon under <a id="l3257"></a>her feet &amp; a crown of twelve stars upon her head. And <a id="l3258"></a>the seven Churches are her first Metropolis &amp; continue to <a id="l3259"></a>be her Metropolis till she flies into the Wilderness ceases to be the seven Churches &amp; becomes <a id="l3260"></a>the Whore of Babylon. And the seven epistles  answer to seven <a id="l3261"></a>successive states which she underwent before she changed her <a id="l3262"></a>Metropolis being admonitions against the approaching apostasy. She was in her first state under the heathen Em<a id="l3263"></a>perors during the lightnings voices &amp; thundrings (Apoc. 11.19) <a id="l3264"></a>untill she appeared in travail; in her second state during <a id="l3265"></a>her travail; in her third state between the birth of the <a id="l3266"></a>Man-child &amp; her receiving two wings of a great Eagle; in <a id="l3267"></a>her fourth state when she floated in the water which the Dra<a id="l3268"></a>gon cast out of his mouth after her; in her fift state <a id="l3269"></a>when the earth had swallowed up the water;  <a id="l3270"></a>in her sixt state when the Dragon was wroth with  <a id="l3271"></a>her; &amp; in her seventh state when the Dragon ceased to per<a id="l3272"></a>secute her &amp; went to make war with the remnant of her <a id="l3273"></a>seed, by which war the seven churches fell in outward form &amp; appearance.</p>
<p id="par125">During these seven periods of time the Church had a <a id="l3274"></a>great struggle with the mystery of iniquity. For this mys<a id="l3275"></a>tery began to work in the Apostles days, &amp; was to continue <a id="l3276"></a>working till the man of Sin should be revealed, being the <a id="l3277"></a>mystery of spiritual fornication written on the Whore's fore<a id="l3278"></a>head. It was founded in Metaphysical mysteries or knowledg falsly so called, &amp; introduced the eating of things sacrificed to Idols. And because this mystery was to overcome the Church <a id="l3279"></a>therefore Christ admonishes her in these Epistles to contend <a id="l3280"></a>against the professors of this mystery calling them Nicolaitans <a id="l3281"></a>or spiritual fornicators, Balaam the fals Prophet &amp; Iezabel <a id="l3282"></a>the fals Prophetess who teach &amp; seduce to eat things sacrificed <a id="l3283"></a>to Idols, &amp; the synagogue of Satan which say they are Iews <a id="l3284"></a>&amp; are not. These are the Antichrist which Iohn tells us should <a id="l3285"></a>come &amp; whose forerunners began to appear in his days, &amp; <a id="l3286"></a>from whose appearance he concludes it was the last time. His <a id="l3287"></a>meaning is that the time of the end spoken of by Daniel in <a id="l3288"></a>which the great Antichrist should rise &amp; reign, was in some respect <a id="l3289"></a>commenced because his forerunners began to appear &amp; once <a id="l3290"></a>appearing were not to cease before his coming. These false <a id="l3291"></a>teachers &amp; their followers being therefore of such dangerous <a id="l3292"></a>consequence, the Epistles to the Churches are chiefly for encoura<a id="l3293"></a>ging the Churches of the first ages to contend against them.</p>
<p id="par126">The first Epistle directed to the Church of Ephesus relates <a id="l3294"></a>to the times of preaching the Gospel before the Woman was in travail, that is, to the state <a id="l3295"></a>of the Church under the heathen Emperors from the Apostles' <a id="l3296"></a>days untill the 10<sup>th</sup> persecution. ffor in this Epistle Christ saith <a id="l3297"></a>that the Church of Ephesus cannot bear them which are evil <a id="l3298"></a>&amp; hath tried them which say they are Apostles &amp; are not &amp; hath <a id="l3299"></a>found them lyars: both which characters, her purity &amp; her trying false <a id="l3300"></a>Apostles, agree best with the primitive times. The false Apostles are <a id="l3301"></a>the fals teachers of the first ages, such as were Simon Magus, <a id="l3302"></a>Menander, Cerinthus, Basilides, Carpocrates, Valentinus, Marcion, Montanus, <a id="l3303"></a>Tatian, Sabellius, Paul of Samosat &amp;c which being forerunners of the great  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p81"> &lt;59r&gt; </span> Antichrist, the Church of Ephesus is commended for trying &amp; dico<a id="l3304"></a>vering them. These are also the Nicolaitans whose deeds the church <a id="l3305"></a>of Ephesus hated, they being  spiritual fornicators who denyed the <a id="l3306"></a>father &amp; the son, as the Apostles Peter &amp;  Iohn describe in their <a id="l3307"></a>Epistles. But yet this Church notwithstanding these her good qualities <a id="l3308"></a>had left her first love. She was much perfected in the beginning <a id="l3309"></a>&amp; had been decaying ever since the Apostles days, and therefore <a id="l3310"></a>Christ admonishes her to remember from whence she was fallen <a id="l3311"></a>&amp; repent &amp; do the first works: otherwise he would come &amp; <a id="l3312"></a>remove her candlestick out of its place. How this Church a <a id="l3313"></a>little before the  tenth persecution had left her first love &amp; <a id="l3314"></a>inclined to æmulation, dissimulation, contention, wrangling backbiting <a id="l3315"></a>&amp; faction, Eusebius in the beginning of the eighth book of his Eccle<a id="l3316"></a>siastical History describes at large, &amp; how instead of repenting she <a id="l3317"></a>grew worse &amp; worse untill the persecution overtook her. For when <a id="l3318"></a>she repented not, Christ brought on this persecution to purge her from <a id="l3319"></a>evil men &amp; in the beginning of the persecution removed her can<a id="l3320"></a>dlestick out of its place, by causing her churches to be thrown <a id="l3321"></a>down throughout all the Empire &amp; her assemblies to be interdicted, <a id="l3322"></a>as Eusebius describes.</p>
<p id="par127">The second Epistle relates manifestly to this persecution, as may <a id="l3323"></a>appear by these words. <em class="underline">And unto the Angel of the Church of Smyrna <a id="l3324"></a>write, These things saith . . . . . he which was dead &amp; is alive; I know <a id="l3325"></a>thy works &amp; tribulation &amp; poverty, but thou art</em> [spiritually] <em class="underline">rich, &amp; I <a id="l3326"></a>know the blasphemy of them which say they are Iews &amp; are not <a id="l3327"></a>but are the synagogue of Satan</em>: [that is, I know the  idolatry <a id="l3328"></a>of the disciples of the false Apostles which now begin to be numerous <a id="l3329"></a>&amp; which say they are Christians &amp; are not, but are the Church of <a id="l3330"></a>Satan:] <em class="underline">fear none of those things which thou shall suffer. Behold <a id="l3331"></a>the Devil</em> [the great red Dragon] <em class="underline">shall cast some of you into <a id="l3332"></a>prison  that ye may be tried &amp; ye shall have tribulation ten <a id="l3333"></a>days</em> [that is, persecution ten years.] <em class="underline">Be thou faithful unto death <a id="l3334"></a>&amp; I will give thee a crown of life. . . . . . . He that overcometh <a id="l3335"></a>shall not be hurt of the second death</em>. By the length of the <a id="l3336"></a>persecution you may certainly know that it was  the tenth <a id="l3337"></a>persecution, that of Dioclesian.</p>
<p id="par128">The third Epistle relates to the times next after the tenth <a id="l3338"></a>persecution, as is manifest by the words: <em class="underline">To the Angel of the <a id="l3339"></a>Church in Pergamus write . . . . . . I know thy works &amp; where thou <a id="l3340"></a>dwellest, even</em> [in Pergamus] <em class="underline">where Satan's throne is</em> [that is, in <a id="l3341"></a>the Greek Empire descended from the kingdom of Pergamus &amp; <a id="l3342"></a>represented in this Prophesy by the great red Dragon that old <a id="l3343"></a>Serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan] <em class="underline">&amp; thou holdest fast my name</em> <a id="l3344"></a>[during the present  reign of the persecuting Greek Em<a id="l3345"></a>peror Licinius] <em class="underline">&amp; hast not denied my faith even in those days <a id="l3346"></a>wherein Antipas was my faithfull martyr who was slain amongst <a id="l3347"></a>you where Satan dwelleth</em> [that is in the days of the tenth per<a id="l3348"></a>secution wherein my faithfull martyrs represented by Antipas <a id="l3349"></a>were slain in the Greek Empire where the Dragon reigneth &amp; <a id="l3350"></a>where the persecution was sharpest &amp; lasted ten years.] <em class="underline">But I <a id="l3351"></a>have a few things against thee because thou hast there</em> [in the <a id="l3352"></a>Greek Empire] <em class="underline">them that hold the doctrine of Balaam</em> [the fals <a id="l3353"></a>Prophet or aggregate of fals teachers] <em class="underline">who taught Balac</em> [the king] <a id="l3354"></a><em class="underline">to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel</em> [to cause them] <a id="l3355"></a><em class="underline">to eat things sacrificed to Idols &amp; to commit fornication: so hast thou <a id="l3356"></a>also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate</em>.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p82"> &lt;60r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">Repent or else I will come unto thee quickly &amp; will fight against <a id="l3357"></a>them with the sword of my mouth</em>. The Nicolaitans were there<a id="l3358"></a>fore such as taught the doctrine of Balaam for seducing the <a id="l3359"></a>people of God to idolatry, a generation of false teachers with <a id="l3360"></a>their churches lasting from the days of the Apostles to the <a id="l3361"></a>time that Christ comes with the sword of his mouth against <a id="l3362"></a>his enemies; the whole body of Antichrist in all ages.</p>
<p id="par129">The fourth Epistle relates to the division of the Em<a id="l3363"></a>pire between Rome &amp; Constantinople &amp; between the sons of <a id="l3364"></a>Constantine the great, &amp; to the Woman growing proud, ambi<a id="l3365"></a>tious &amp; potent &amp; claiming appeals from all the world, which is <a id="l3366"></a>the universal bishopric, &amp; thereby beginning to set up Popery <a id="l3367"></a>The words run thus. <em class="underline">And to the Church in Thyatira write, These <a id="l3368"></a>things saith the son of God who hath eyes like unto a <a id="l3369"></a>flame of fire &amp; his feet like fine brass</em> [the types of the <a id="l3370"></a>eastern &amp; western Churches or two wings of the great Eagle] <a id="l3371"></a><em class="underline">I know thy works &amp; charity &amp;c. Notwithstanding I have a few <a id="l3372"></a>things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Ieza<a id="l3373"></a>bel who calleth her self a prophetess</em> [&amp; is tainted with the <a id="l3374"></a>doctrine of the Nicolaitans] <em class="underline">to teach &amp; to seduce my servants <a id="l3375"></a>to commit</em> [spiritual] <em class="underline">fornication &amp; to eat things sacrificed to <a id="l3376"></a>Idols. And I have given her space to repent of her for<a id="l3377"></a>nication &amp; she will not repent. Behold I will cast her into <a id="l3378"></a>a bed</em> [of torment] <em class="underline">&amp; them that commit fornication with her <a id="l3379"></a>into great tribulation</em> [in the lake of fire] <em class="underline">except they repent</em>.</p>
<p id="par130">The fift Epistle respects the Church reunited under <a id="l3380"></a>Constantius, at which time it flourished with temporal prosperity <a id="l3381"></a>&amp; grandeur &amp; with multitudes of people, &amp; made an outward <a id="l3382"></a>profession of  the truth against the innovations of <a id="l3383"></a>Arius &amp; the Pope &amp; others, but through prosperity abounded with dissemblers, <a id="l3384"></a>&amp; was much decayed in piety &amp; vertue, &amp; had but few good <a id="l3385"></a>Christians. For the Epistle runs thus. <em class="underline">And unto the Angel of <a id="l3386"></a>the Church in Sardis write: These things saith he that hath <a id="l3387"></a>the seven spirits of God &amp; the seven stars</em> [the type of the <a id="l3388"></a>Angels of the whole united Church] <em class="underline">I know thy works that <a id="l3389"></a>thou hast a name that thou livest &amp; art dead. Be watchful <a id="l3390"></a>&amp; strengthen the things that are ready to dye: for I have not <a id="l3391"></a>found thy works perfect before God. . . . . . . Thou hast a few names <a id="l3392"></a>even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments, &amp; they <a id="l3393"></a>shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy</em>.</p>
<p id="par131">The sixt Epistle respects the Church in affliction during the <a id="l3394"></a>reign of Iulian the Apostate a heathen Emperor; as is manifest by <a id="l3395"></a>the words. <em class="underline">And to the Angel of the Church in Philadelphia <a id="l3396"></a>write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true he <a id="l3397"></a>that hath the key of David</em> [the key of the Temple which Isaiah<sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> <a id="l3398"></a>calls the key of the house of David] <em class="underline">he that openeth</em> [to the throne <a id="l3399"></a>of God] <em class="underline">&amp; no man shutteth &amp; shutteth</em> [from the throne] <em class="underline">&amp; no man <a id="l3400"></a>openeth: I know thy works: Behold I have set before thee an open <a id="l3401"></a>door</em> [to the throne from whence thou art at present excluded] <a id="l3402"></a><em class="underline">&amp; no man can shut it</em> [to hinder thee from entring in again.] <a id="l3403"></a><em class="underline">For thou hast a little strength &amp;</em> [in this time of persecution] <em class="underline">hast</em>  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p83"> &lt;61r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">not denied my name. Behold I will make them of the synagogue <a id="l3404"></a>of Satan which say they are Iews</em> [the Nicolaitans which say they are <a id="l3405"></a>Christians] <em class="underline">&amp; are not, but do lye; behold I will make them to come <a id="l3406"></a>&amp; worship before thy feet, &amp; to know that I have loved thee. Be<a id="l3407"></a>cause</em> [in the reign of the Emperor Iulian] <em class="underline">thou hast kept the <a id="l3408"></a>word of my patience, I also will keep from the hour of temp<a id="l3409"></a>tation which</em> [by false miracles] <em class="underline">shall come upon all the world</em> <a id="l3410"></a>[to set up the invocation of Saints &amp; the worship of dead men &amp; there<a id="l3411"></a>by] <em class="underline">to try them that dwell upon the earth</em>.</p>
<p id="par132">The seventh Epistle relates to the Church in the reign of <a id="l3412"></a>Iovian Valentinian &amp; Valens, when by recovering the throne she grew great <a id="l3413"></a>&amp; splendid &amp; abounded in wealth but abated in vertue &amp; piety till <a id="l3414"></a>Christ spewed her out of his mouth. <em class="underline">I know thy works</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">that <a id="l3415"></a>thou art neither cold not hot: I would thou wert cold nor hot. So <a id="l3416"></a>then because thou art luke warm &amp; neither cold not hot, I <a id="l3417"></a>will spue thee out of my mouth: because thou sayest I am <a id="l3418"></a>rich &amp; increased with goods; &amp; knowest not that thou art <a id="l3419"></a>wretched &amp; miserable &amp; poor &amp; blind &amp; naked</em>. This Church <a id="l3420"></a>was spewed out of Christs mouth at the opening of the seventh <a id="l3421"></a>seal. ffor then the twelve tribes of Israel, which are the pri<a id="l3422"></a>mitive Church Catholick represented by the Woman, were re<a id="l3423"></a>jected &amp; received the mark of the Beast except the 144000 <a id="l3424"></a>which were sealed with the seale of God in their forehead. <a id="l3425"></a>Then the first beast rose out of the Sea &amp; began to be worshipped &amp; his <a id="l3426"></a>mark to be received by all men. Then the woman  escaped into the wilder<a id="l3427"></a>ness &amp; began to commit fornication with the kings of the earth &amp; the second Beast rose up in her <a id="l3428"></a>room,  &amp; the Dragon began to make war with the remnant of her <a id="l3429"></a>seed which keep the commandments of God &amp; have the testimony of <a id="l3430"></a>Iesus Christ.  All these things are of a kind &amp; began at once &amp; <a id="l3431"></a>brought in a new scene of things</p>
<p id="par133">In the beginning of the visions of the Woman &amp; Dragon <a id="l3432"></a>the Temple of God was opened in heaven that Iohn might see <a id="l3433"></a>those visions therein: &amp; therefore when the Woman fled from the <a id="l3434"></a>Dragon into the wilderness it is to be conceived that she fled from <a id="l3435"></a>this Temple &amp; left in it the remnant of her seed which keep the <a id="l3436"></a>commandments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus, &amp; that the <a id="l3437"></a>Dragon turning from the Woman made war upon the remnant in <a id="l3438"></a>this Temple while she was flying through the wilderness of <a id="l3439"></a>Arabia to Babylon, &amp; that the seven candlesticks in this Temple <a id="l3440"></a> represent the  Woman &amp; her seed till she separates from them   &amp; with a splendid external form of Church government flyes into a state of spiritual barrenness &amp; becomes the Whore of Babylon.  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 61v &gt; </span>- represent the Woman &amp; her seed till she separates from them &amp; <a id="l3443"></a>with an external form of Church government flyes into a  state of spiritual barrennes &amp; becomes the  splendid <a id="l3445"></a>whore of Babylon. For then she is spewed out of Christs <a id="l3446"></a>mouth &amp;  her candlestick is removed out of its place. <a id="l3447"></a>Then she ceases to be illuminated by the seven lamps, &amp; <a id="l3448"></a>to be represented by the seven golden candlesticks,  and <a id="l3463"></a>then Christ ceases to write any more epistles unto her.

After she was overcome there was no need of <a id="l3467"></a>any more  admonitions of that kind.</p>

<p id="par134">It is further to be conceived that this Temple being the <a id="l3468"></a>Temple of Ierusalem on mount Sion, was the same Temple <a id="l3469"></a>with that on mount Sion in which the the 144000 stood with the <a id="l3470"></a>Lamb before the throne &amp; before the four Animals &amp; before <a id="l3471"></a>the Elders, &amp; that the 144000 are they that worship God in <a id="l3472"></a>this Temple, &amp; by consequence the remnant of the Woman's <a id="l3473"></a>seed, or so many of them as were sealed. For they were <a id="l3474"></a>sealed out of all the twelve Tribes of Israel, &amp; those Tribes <a id="l3475"></a>worshipped in the Temple of Ierusalem on mount Sion where  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p85"> &lt;62r&gt; </span> the Lamb took the book &amp; opened the Seals thereof.</p>
<p id="par135">And therefore when all are killed who will not worship <a id="l3476"></a>the Image of the Beast &amp; none are suffered to buy &amp; sell <a id="l3477"></a>except those who have the mark or name or number of <a id="l3478"></a>the name of the Beast: we are to conceive that this is <a id="l3479"></a>done by a persecution of the remnant of the Womans seed <a id="l3480"></a>&amp; that this persecution is the war which the Dragon <a id="l3481"></a>went to make upon this remnant. ffirst the Dragon per<a id="l3482"></a>secuted the Woman &amp; made her fly into the wilderness &amp; <a id="l3483"></a>so soon as she escaped from him, he turned from her &amp; went <a id="l3484"></a>to make war upon the remnant of her seed &amp; in this war <a id="l3485"></a>he killed those who would not worship the Image of the <a id="l3486"></a>Beast &amp; interdicted buying &amp; selling to all who had not the <a id="l3487"></a>mark or name or number of that Beast. And thereupon <a id="l3488"></a>all receive that mark or name or number except the <a id="l3489"></a>144000 who by persisting in the truth get the victory &amp; <a id="l3490"></a>are sealed with the name of God in their foreheads &amp; <a id="l3491"></a>stand on mount Sion with the Lamb.</p>
<p id="par136">It is further to be conceived that this persecution <a id="l3492"></a>was raised by the influence of the second Beast. He <a id="l3493"></a>spake as the Dragon &amp; was the Dragon's Church, &amp; there<a id="l3494"></a>fore the Dragon acted by his advice in matters of reli<a id="l3495"></a>gion. He declared what ought to be done in those matters, <a id="l3496"></a>&amp; the Dragon was the temporal power which put it in <a id="l3497"></a>execution. When the first Beast had been slain &amp; revi<a id="l3498"></a>ved &amp; rose out of the sea, the second Beast deified <a id="l3499"></a>him &amp; caused men (the subjects of the Dragon) to erect an <a id="l3500"></a>image to him &amp; worship it &amp; to receive the mark of the <a id="l3501"></a>deified Beast upon pain of being interdicted buying &amp; <a id="l3502"></a>selling. He had power to bring down fire from heaven <a id="l3503"></a>upon earth in the sight of men, that is, to bring down <a id="l3504"></a>war &amp; persecution upon those that would not worship the <a id="l3505"></a>Beast &amp; his Image. ffirst he excommunicated them &amp; in <a id="l3506"></a>pronouncing the excommunication brought down a lighted <a id="l3507"></a>torch (as a custome is in excommunications) from above <a id="l3508"></a>his head, which is bringing down fire from heaven in a <a id="l3509"></a>literal sense &amp; then he delivered them up to the temporal <a id="l3510"></a>power to be killed or interdicted buying &amp; selling.</p>
<p id="par137">The 144000 being thus interdicted the society of the <a id="l3511"></a>twelve Tribes, retire from the Court of the people  <a id="l3512"></a>into the inward court where the Lamb is, &amp; standing with <a id="l3513"></a>the Lamb before the throne &amp; before the Elders &amp; the four Ani<a id="l3514"></a>mals, suppose at the eastern gate of that court where the Levites <a id="l3515"></a>used to sing, they sing a new song  at the sacrifices  on the ffast or on the  day of the Dedication &amp; on  the seven days of the ensuing ffeast, while <a id="l3516"></a>their Angels represented by the seven Lamps sound the seven <a id="l3517"></a>Trumpets &amp; pour out the seven Vials at the same sacrifices. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p86"> &lt;63r&gt; </span> And in the mean time the twelve Tribes worship the Dragon <a id="l3518"></a>&amp; the Image of the Beast in their own Court, the outward <a id="l3519"></a>Court of the Temple, till the seven plagues be fulfilled <a id="l3520"></a>For they are the synagogue of Satan which say they are <a id="l3521"></a>Iews &amp; are not, &amp; the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea <a id="l3522"></a>convened in the outward Court of the Temple, where <a id="l3523"></a>the Dragon that old Serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan  when he was cast out <a id="l3524"></a>of heaven by Michael, came down to them with great wrath, <a id="l3525"></a>knowing that he hath but a short time amongst them untill <a id="l3526"></a>he shall be cast into the bottomless pit.</p>

All which <a id="l3560"></a>agrees to Trajan the first Emperor of the second Dynasty. <a id="l3561"></a>This Dynasty was of Spaniards a people westward from Rome <a id="l3562"></a> &amp; Trajan was the greatest conqueror of all the Roman <a id="l3564"></a>Emperors. The Empire was almost dissolved by the  seditions <a id="l3565"></a>&amp; defections in Nero's reign &amp; something repaired by Vespasian <a id="l3566"></a>&amp; again made to totter by Domitian. Trajan not only resetled <a id="l3567"></a>it but enlarged it by forreign conquests more then ever did <a id="l3568"></a>any other Emperor; insomuch that historians reccon the <span class="greek">ακμη</span> <a id="l3569"></a>of the Empire to have been in his reign, and that the Emperor  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p88"> &lt;65r&gt; </span> Iulian in his Cæsars, singling out Iulius Cæsar, Octavius, Trajan <a id="l3570"></a>Marcus &amp; Constantine as the five gallantest of all the Roman <a id="l3571"></a>Emperors to compare with Alexander the great, calls Iulius, <a id="l3572"></a>Octavius &amp; Trajan the most warlike &amp; in conclusion allots <a id="l3573"></a>Trajan to keep company with Alexander. He was the first <a id="l3574"></a>that propagated the Empire beyond the Danube &amp; having <a id="l3575"></a>conquered &amp; almost depopulated Dacia by war he repeopled <a id="l3576"></a>it with great numbers from several parts of the Empire <a id="l3577"></a>He gave a king to the Albani &amp; received those of Iberia <a id="l3578"></a>&amp; Colchos &amp; the Cimmerian Bosphori &amp; Sauromatæ. He <a id="l3579"></a>seized the regions of the  Saracens &amp; <a id="l3580"></a>Arabians &amp; reduced Arabia into the form of a Province. <a id="l3581"></a>He recovered Armenia from the Parthians &amp; conquered <a id="l3582"></a>Mesopotamia &amp; Assyria reducing them into the form of <a id="l3583"></a>Provinces, &amp; was the first that extended the Empire beyond <a id="l3584"></a>Euphrates. He subdued the Cordueni &amp; Mardomedi &amp; Seleu<a id="l3585"></a>cia &amp; Ctesiphon &amp; Babylonia &amp; made the king of Parthia <a id="l3586"></a>give him hostages, &amp; went as far as India &amp; built a Navy <a id="l3587"></a>in the Persian gulph to invade the Indians. In his letters <a id="l3588"></a>to the Senate he gave them account of so many conquered <a id="l3589"></a>nations that they neither knew them all nor could number <a id="l3590"></a>them &amp; therefore besides other honours, they erected to him <a id="l3591"></a>a triumphal arch in the market place of Rome &amp; decreed <a id="l3592"></a>that he might triumph of as many nations as he pleased <a id="l3593"></a>But when he was upon the sea the conquered nations <a id="l3594"></a>revolted &amp; slew the garrisons: upon which followed great <a id="l3595"></a>confusion &amp; slaughters on both sides. The Iews also in <a id="l3596"></a>Libya &amp; Cyrene &amp; Egypt &amp; Thebais &amp; Cyprus revolted <a id="l3597"></a>&amp; slew great multitudes of the Romans &amp; Greeks putting <a id="l3598"></a>them to various deaths &amp; eating their flesh. Dion reccons <a id="l3599"></a>about 200000 slain about Cyrene &amp; 240000 in Cyprus <a id="l3600"></a>&amp; the like slaughter in Egypt. Whereupon Trajan sent <a id="l3601"></a>captains against them who slew vast multitudes of them. And <a id="l3602"></a>because they were very numerous in Mesopotamia he com<a id="l3603"></a>manded that they should be all slain &amp; rooted out of that <a id="l3604"></a>Province; &amp; accordingly great numbers of them were slain <a id="l3605"></a>there.

<h2 id="hd22" class="cent">Sect. III. <a id="l3608"></a><br>The third Seal opened.</h2>
<p id="par140">At the opening of the third Seal the third Beast which had <a id="l3609"></a>a humane face &amp; stood southward from the throne called <a id="l3610"></a>Iohn to come &amp; look southward. <em class="underline">And lo, a black horse, &amp; he <a id="l3611"></a>that sat on him had a pair of ballances in his hand, &amp;</em> Iohn  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p89"> &lt;66r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">heard a voice in the midst of the four Beasts say, A chœnix of <a id="l3612"></a>wheat for a penny &amp; three Chœnixes of Barley for a penny <a id="l3613"></a>&amp; see thou hurt not the oyle &amp; the wine</em>. All which is the <a id="l3614"></a>exact character of Severus the founder of the southern <a id="l3615"></a>dynasty of Emperors. A pair of ballances denotes a Iudge <a id="l3616"></a>just or unjust accordinly as the ballance is true or false <a id="l3617"></a>sincere or bruised, &amp; such was Severus. In his childhood <a id="l3618"></a>he used no other play then of walking with the fasces &amp; <a id="l3619"></a>axes before him &amp; of sitting with the boys about him &amp; <a id="l3620"></a>acting the Iudge. At the age of 32 years he was designed <a id="l3621"></a>Prætor by the Emperor Marcus. When he came to be <a id="l3622"></a>Emperor he heard causes all the morning till noon, was <a id="l3623"></a>severely just, &amp; inexorable against criminals, made ex<a id="l3624"></a>cellent laws, left his Deputy Iudge when  war required <a id="l3625"></a>him to lead the army &amp; instituted his sons in the law, &amp; <a id="l3626"></a>from him that study took such encouragement that I know <a id="l3627"></a>not any other age of the Empire where a greater number <a id="l3628"></a>of famous lawyers are recorded then that which followed <a id="l3629"></a>his reign most of which were the auditors of Papinian his <a id="l3630"></a>special favourite. The voice in the midst of the four <a id="l3631"></a>Beasts respects Rome the center of the Empire. And <a id="l3632"></a>there the measure by which the corn in the publick <a id="l3633"></a>granaries was dispensed  for the sustenance of the <a id="l3634"></a>people was a Chœnix. The proclamation, A Chœnix <a id="l3635"></a>for a penny denotes plenty; &amp; Severus was the first <a id="l3636"></a>who increased the corn in the publick store houses of <a id="l3637"></a>Rome &amp; so far as I can find he was the first that <a id="l3638"></a>gave them oyle &amp; gave it gratis. When Severus <a id="l3639"></a>had newly conquered Albinus, in writing an angry letter <a id="l3640"></a>to the Senate he thus commemorates his benefactions &amp; <a id="l3641"></a>upbraids them for their ingratitude. Ego frumenta reipublicae <a id="l3642"></a>detuli, ego multa bella pro republica gessi, ego populo Ro<a id="l3643"></a>mano tantum olei detuli quantum rerum natura <a id="l3644"></a>vix habuit; ego interfecto P. Nigro vos a malis tyran<a id="l3645"></a>nis liberavi: Magnam sane mihi reddidistis vicem, <a id="l3646"></a>magnam gratiam. Spartian tells us: Rei frumentariæ <a id="l3647"></a>quam minimam repererat ita consuluit, ut excedens <a id="l3648"></a>vita septem annorum Canonem populo Romano re<a id="l3649"></a>linqueret, ita ut quotidiana septuagena quina millia <a id="l3650"></a>modiorum expendi possent, olei verò tantum ut per <a id="l3651"></a>quinquennium non solum Vrbis usibus sed et totius <a id="l3652"></a>Italiæ quæ oleo egeret, sufficeret. Whence Casaubon <a id="l3653"></a>by recconing eight Chœnixes to a bushel collects that <a id="l3654"></a>there were 600000 persons in the Turba frumentaria  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p90"> &lt;67r&gt; </span> of that city. Severus gave also a very fertile feild to the <a id="l3655"></a>city, which I suppose was for vines. The black colour of his <a id="l3656"></a>horse is a type of funerals of great men such whose fune<a id="l3657"></a>rals then used &amp; still use to be solemnized in this mourn<a id="l3658"></a>ing colour. And for the slaughter of such his reign was so <a id="l3659"></a>infamous as much to transcend the reigns of the worst Ty<a id="l3660"></a>rants Nero Domitian &amp; Commodus. When he overcame Pisce<a id="l3661"></a>nuis Niger in Syria he shewed much cruelty by which and <a id="l3662"></a>the austerity of his manners (for he was against his <a id="l3663"></a>enemies very cruel &amp; inexorable) the Senate &amp; Citizens <a id="l3664"></a>of Rome became so disaffected to him as in his war <a id="l3665"></a>with Albinus to favour his enemy. Whereupon he put <a id="l3666"></a>to death great multitudes of men &amp; weomen of the best <a id="l3667"></a>quality in Spain &amp; Gallia where Albinus reigned &amp; <a id="l3668"></a>was conquered, &amp; afterwards in Italy at his return  <a id="l3669"></a>thither; &amp; confiscating their estates gave more to the <a id="l3670"></a>soldiers &amp; left more to his sons then any other Emperor. <a id="l3671"></a>Amongst the rest he slew very many of the Senators, <a id="l3672"></a>the letters which he found with Albinus betraying them. <a id="l3673"></a>Spartian names 41 Senators whom he put to death without <a id="l3674"></a>hearing them, and then adds: Horum igitur tantorum ac <a id="l3675"></a>tam illustrium virorum (nam multi in his Consultares, <a id="l3676"></a>multi Prætorij, omnes certè summi viri fuere) inter<a id="l3677"></a>fector, ab Afris ut Deus habebatur. - - - Damnabantur <a id="l3678"></a>autem plerique cur jocati essent, alij cur tacuissent, alij <a id="l3679"></a>cur pleraque figuratè dixissent, ut quod esset Imperator <a id="l3680"></a>verè sui nominis verè Pertinax vere Severus.

<h2 id="hd23" class="cent">Sect. IV. <a id="l3693"></a><br>The fourth seal opened.</h2>
<p id="par141">At the opening of the fourth seal the fourth Beast <a id="l3694"></a>which was like a flying Eagle (the embleme of slaughter) &amp; stood <a id="l3695"></a>northward from the throne, called Iohn to come &amp; look northward,  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p91"> &lt;68r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">and Iohn looked &amp; behold a pale horse &amp; his name that sat <a id="l3696"></a>on him was death &amp;  Hades followed  him, &amp; power <a id="l3697"></a>was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth to <a id="l3698"></a>kill with the sword &amp; with hunger &amp; with death &amp; with the <a id="l3699"></a>Beasts of the earth</em>. This character agrees fully to Decius the <a id="l3700"></a>first Emperor of the northern Dynasty. His name was Death &amp; <a id="l3701"></a>he rode on a horse of a pale colour the colour usually ascribed <a id="l3702"></a>to death: &amp; this was thus fulfilled. The Scythians from Tanais <a id="l3703"></a>invading Thrace, Decius beat them at first,  but pursuing <a id="l3705"></a>them to the Banks of Tanais &amp; there endeavouring to attack <a id="l3706"></a>them through a lake; he stuck fast &amp; perished with his son <a id="l3707"></a>&amp; his whole army.</p>
<p id="par142">It is not to be expected  that all the Emperors in a whole <a id="l3708"></a>Dynasty should be of one &amp; the same sort &amp; character; all of the <a id="l3709"></a>first Dynasty conquerors &amp; good men, all of the second very great <a id="l3710"></a>warriors &amp; disturbers of the peace of the earth, &amp; all of the third <a id="l3711"></a>eminent Iudges : &amp; therefore I have applied the characters of <a id="l3712"></a>the horsmen only to the first Emperor of every Dynasty, &amp; <a id="l3713"></a>accordingly have interpreted the fourth horsman of Decius <a id="l3714"></a>alone. But this Horsman was followed by Hades, the king of <a id="l3715"></a>the dead, who had power over the fourth part of the earth <a id="l3716"></a>(that is, over the Roman Empire which was about the <a id="l3717"></a>fourth part of the habitable world then known) to kill <a id="l3718"></a>with the <em class="underline">sword</em> &amp; with <em class="underline">hunger</em> &amp; with <em class="underline">death</em> &amp; with the <a id="l3719"></a><em class="underline">beasts of the earth</em>, that is with civil wars, with famin, <a id="l3720"></a>with pestilence &amp; with forreign kingdoms or nations <a id="l3721"></a>invading the Empire. And therefore we are further to <a id="l3722"></a>shew how Hades after the reign of Decius afflicted the <a id="l3723"></a>Empire with these four plagues.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="hd24" class="cent">The Plague Of the Beasts of the earth.</h2>
<p id="par143">Vpon the death of Decius &amp; his army, the barbarous <a id="l3724"></a>nations began to invade the Empire on all sides. The Scythians <a id="l3725"></a>invaded both Europe &amp; Asia; the Goths Borani Carpi and <a id="l3726"></a>Vrugundi invaded Europe, the Persians invaded Mesopotamia <a id="l3727"></a>&amp; Syria &amp; took Antioch. All this was in the two years reign <a id="l3728"></a>of Gallus the successor of Decius. In Valerian's reign the <a id="l3729"></a>Scythians invaded Greece Illyricum Italy &amp; Asia; the Mar<a id="l3730"></a>comans &amp; others invaded other places; the Goths Borani Carpi <a id="l3731"></a>&amp; Vrugundi over-ran all Italy &amp; Illyricum &amp; some of them <a id="l3732"></a>passed into Asia, the Germans infested Gallia &amp; were opposed <a id="l3733"></a>by Gallienus, &amp; the Persians over-ran the east &amp; took <a id="l3734"></a>Valerian captive. And after all this the state of the Em<a id="l3735"></a>pire grew still worse.

<h2 id="hd25" class="cent">The plague of the Sword.</h2>
<p id="par144">Vpon the death of Decius the Empire fell into disorder <a id="l3762"></a>as well by civil wars as by barbarian invasions, so that between <a id="l3763"></a>Decius &amp; Dioclesian, that is, within the space of 33 years, of <a id="l3764"></a>about 21 legitimate Emperors &amp; Cæsars (besides seven tyranni<a id="l3765"></a>cal ones who perished all by the sword) there died only Licinian <a id="l3766"></a>&amp; Claudius by the pestilence &amp; Carus by lightning &amp; three more <a id="l3767"></a>were slain by the publick enemy, &amp; all the rest fell by the <a id="l3768"></a>sword of one another or of their own soldiers. And besides all <a id="l3769"></a>these, within the fifteen years reign of Gallienus who was one of <a id="l3770"></a>the one &amp; twenty, there arose no less then 29 or 30 other <a id="l3771"></a>Tyrannical Emperors some of which were as powerful as Galli<a id="l3772"></a>enus himself, &amp; all these also fell by the sword except three <a id="l3773"></a>or four who had their lives given them by their conquerors <a id="l3774"></a>What slaughters followed upon the civil wars between so many <a id="l3775"></a>Emperors &amp; Tyrants may easily be imagined. I shall con<a id="l3776"></a>tent my self with one instance. Vpon conquering  <a id="l3777"></a>Ingenuus who was saluted Emperor by the Legions of Mœsia <a id="l3778"></a>Gallienus was so cruel towards both soldiers &amp; inhabitants of <a id="l3779"></a>Mœsia as to leave many cities void of Males. His cruelty <a id="l3780"></a>may be understood by this Epistle to Verianus. Gallienus Veri<a id="l3781"></a>ano. Non mihi satis facies si tantum armatos occideris quos <a id="l3782"></a>et fors belli perimere potuisset: perimendus est omnis sexus <a id="l3783"></a>virilis, si et senes atque impuberes sine reprehensione nostra <a id="l3784"></a>occidi possint.

<h2 id="hd26" class="cent">The plagues of ffamin &amp; Pestilence.</h2>
<p id="par145">In the first year of Gallus the successor of Decius a vehement <a id="l3788"></a>plague began from Ethiopia &amp; went through all the Roman Pro<a id="l3789"></a>vinces exhausting them wonderfully till after the death of Claudius, <a id="l3790"></a>that is for about fifteen years together. Vbique maximam partem <a id="l3791"></a>incolentium exhausit, pleraque loca inhabitata reliquit: Latus. <a id="l3792"></a>Per omnia Romani regni ab Oriente in Occidentem spatia, cùm <a id="l3793"></a>omne propemodum genus hominum &amp; pecudum neci dedit, tum <a id="l3794"></a>etiam corripuit lacus et infecit pabula tabo: Oros. l. 7. c. 27. <a id="l3795"></a>Nec alia unquam major lues mihi lecta spatio temporum <a id="l3796"></a>sive terrarum: Lipsius de Constant. 2.23. At the same time <a id="l3797"></a>with this plague a famin also began which lasted longer then <a id="l3798"></a>the plague, the wars hindring agriculture &amp; wasting the <a id="l3799"></a>old stores. In Gallus's reign Dionysius Alexandrinus <a id="l3800"></a>thus mentions it in his epistle to the brethren. Post hæc <a id="l3801"></a>(that is, after the persecution of Decius) et bellum et <a id="l3802"></a>fames secula sunt, quæ una cum ethnicis pertulimus. <a id="l3803"></a> - - - At ubi cùm nos tum ipsi respiraveramus invasit lues <a id="l3804"></a>ista, res illis quovis terrore terribilior &amp; calamitate <a id="l3805"></a>quacunque lamentabilior, nobis vero exercitatio et explo<a id="l3806"></a>ratio nullis reliquis inferior. In Valerian's reign Cypri<a id="l3807"></a>an thus mentions both: Cum dicas plurimos conqueri <a id="l3808"></a>quod <em class="underline">bella</em> crebrius surgant quod <em class="underline">Lues</em> quod <em class="underline">ffames</em> <a id="l3809"></a>sæviant, quodque imbres &amp; pluviæ serena longa suspen<a id="l3810"></a>dant. In  Claudius's reign Zosimus <a id="l3811"></a>tells us that a body of Barbarians in Macedonia perished <a id="l3812"></a>by famin with their cattel: and Pollio that a multitude <a id="l3813"></a>of barbarians in Thrace laboured so much under famin <a id="l3814"></a>&amp; pestilence that Claudius sleighted them. And in Aure<a id="l3815"></a>lian's reign Zosimus mentions how a body of Scythans <a id="l3816"></a>in Pannonia were prest with famin</p>
<p id="par146">So terrible were these plagues of wars pestilence &amp; famin <a id="l3817"></a>that Cyprian who lived in that age, concluded from them that <a id="l3818"></a>the end of the world was at hand, as you may understand by <a id="l3819"></a>his Tract de Mortalitate &amp; yet he was martyred before the <a id="l3820"></a>reign of Gallienus when they were at the height.</p>
<p id="par147">You have now the interpretation of the four horsmen; <a id="l3821"></a>and as there is nothing in the Prophesy which has not to a <a id="l3822"></a>title been fulfilled, so the Prophesy had omitted nothing <a id="l3823"></a>remarkable enough to be a convenient character of the thing <a id="l3824"></a>designed to be characterised. For what was there in Trajan's <a id="l3825"></a>reign very singular besides his victories &amp; the ensuing killing <a id="l3826"></a>one another? What in Severus's besides his acting the Iudge, killing  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p94"> &lt;71r&gt; </span> the Senators &amp; great men &amp; augmenting the city provisions? <a id="l3827"></a>What in Decius's but his perishing with his whole army? <a id="l3828"></a>And what was there in the times immediately following him, <a id="l3829"></a>worth being taken notice of in comparison of the four plagues? <a id="l3830"></a>I say what was there singular? For as for Trajan's humanity, <a id="l3831"></a>Severus's wars, &amp; the like, they were things common to them <a id="l3832"></a>with divers other Emperors: whereas the prophesy (as was <a id="l3833"></a>fit) takes notice of nothing but what was most remarka<a id="l3834"></a>ble in the kind. You may find other conquerors besides <a id="l3835"></a>Trajan, other killing one another besides that in the <a id="l3836"></a>Iewish war, other Iudges &amp; killers of great men besides <a id="l3837"></a>Severus, &amp; others perishing fatally besides Decius; but <a id="l3838"></a>all the Roman History will not afford others so eminent <a id="l3839"></a>in the kind as these, nor which are combined with one <a id="l3840"></a>another after the same manner. And as for the quater<a id="l3841"></a>nary of plagues, I know nothing like it. So that the <a id="l3842"></a>Prophesy &amp; History do not only fit, but are not otherwise <a id="l3843"></a>to be fitted.</p>

<h2 id="hd27" class="cent">Sect. V. <a id="l3844"></a><br>The fift Seale opened.</h2>
<p id="par148">The four horsmen being the first four  Dynasties of the <a id="l3845"></a>Empire or heads of the Dragon &amp; appearing upon opening the first four <a id="l3846"></a>seales we may expect that the fift head or Dynasty is the subject of <a id="l3847"></a>the fift leaf of the prophetick book &amp; appears upon opening the fift <a id="l3848"></a>Seal. The first Dynasties were monarchical, this is of several <a id="l3849"></a>Emperors reigning  at the same time &amp; sharing the Empire <a id="l3850"></a>between them by consent. It began with the reign of Dioclesian &amp; <a id="l3851"></a>his Colleagues &amp; lasted till Constantine the great, by conquering Lici<a id="l3852"></a>nius reduced the Empire back into a monarchical form, as was said <a id="l3853"></a>above. It is also distinguished from the former Dynasties by the <a id="l3854"></a>Æra of the Empire dated from its beginning &amp; called the Æra of <a id="l3855"></a>Dioclesian &amp; the Æra of the Martyrs. ffor after the Empire by <a id="l3856"></a>the four plagues of the last Dynasty was almost dissolved &amp; <a id="l3857"></a>ruined, it was restored &amp; as it were new founded by Dioclesian &amp; <a id="l3858"></a>his Colleagues &amp; brought to a very flourishing state. Its character <a id="l3859"></a>is a great persecution of the Christians. For <em class="underline">when</em> the Lamb <em class="underline">had <a id="l3860"></a>opened the fift seale Iohn saw under the Altar the   souls <a id="l3861"></a>of them that were slain for the word of God &amp; for the testimony which <a id="l3862"></a>they held. And they cried with a loud voice saying, How long, o Lord, <a id="l3863"></a>holy &amp; true dost thou not judge &amp; avenge our blood on them <a id="l3864"></a>that dwell on the earth. And while robes were given unto every one <a id="l3865"></a>of them &amp; it was said unto them that they should rest yet for <a id="l3866"></a>a little season untill their fellow servants also &amp; their brethren <a id="l3867"></a>that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled</em>. This <a id="l3868"></a>is a very plain description of an  extraordinary persecution of the Church <a id="l3869"></a> &amp; answers perfectly to Dioclesian's persecution &amp; to <a id="l3870"></a>that alone. For that Persecution was notably sharp &amp; great <a id="l3871"></a>above all the former persecutions &amp; seems to have exceeded <a id="l3872"></a>them all put together, &amp; to have been the only persecution which <a id="l3873"></a>was universal, so that in respect of this the former deserve  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p95"> &lt;72r&gt; </span> but little to be considered. Amongst the former that of Decius is <a id="l3874"></a>accounted the greatest being much more sharp &amp; general then <a id="l3875"></a>the rest &amp; yet that was not universal nor lasted above one year <a id="l3876"></a>&amp; three months; whereas this continued with unexpressible violence <a id="l3877"></a> ten years together over <a id="l3878"></a>all the east beyond Italy, &amp; almost the two first of those years <a id="l3879"></a>over all the west but with less violence the western nations afford<a id="l3880"></a>ing fewer Martyrs &amp; Confessors. This is the Tribulation of ten days <a id="l3881"></a>which the Church of Smyrna was to suffer. It began in Spring A.C. <a id="l3882"></a>303 &amp; was so vehement that in about thirty days were slain <a id="l3883"></a>17000. And yet it was sharper in the second year then in the <a id="l3884"></a>first, &amp; after it ceased in the west it grew notably sharper  under Maximinus in the east &amp; did not begin to mi<a id="l3886"></a>tigate before the end of the seventh year. In Egypt alone <a id="l3887"></a>were slain (saith Ignatius of Antioch) 144000, and seventy <a id="l3888"></a>thousand banished. And if you peruse the description which Eu<a id="l3889"></a>sebius gives of it you will scarce find it milder in other Pro<a id="l3890"></a>vinces. From this persecution the Æra of Dioclesian was <a id="l3891"></a>called the Æra of Martyrs. These Martyrs are represented <a id="l3892"></a>as sacrifices lying under the Altar, that is, on the pave<a id="l3893"></a>ment at the foot of the Altar where the sacrifices used <a id="l3894"></a>to be slain, &amp; they are told that they must rest for a little <a id="l3895"></a>season untill the sufferings of their brethren who should be <a id="l3896"></a>killed as they were should be accomplished; that is, untill the <a id="l3897"></a>end of the great tribulation, or untill the times of the seventh <a id="l3898"></a>seal should be expired. For the little season is the reign of <a id="l3899"></a>the seventh head or king called a short space Apoc. 17.10, &amp; <a id="l3900"></a>a short time Apoc 12. And as the Tribulation of ten days came <a id="l3901"></a>in the end of the reign of the heathen Empire &amp; was followed <a id="l3902"></a>by a victory of the Christians which put an end to the reign of <a id="l3903"></a>the heathens:  so the great Tribulation is to come in the <a id="l3904"></a>end of the Empire of the great Antichrist &amp; is to be  <a id="l3905"></a>immediately followed by a victory of the saints which will put an <a id="l3906"></a>end to the reign of the Antichristians. And then God will judge <a id="l3907"></a>&amp; avenge the blood of the Martyrs on them that dwell on <a id="l3908"></a>the earth.</p>

What this means <a id="l3927"></a>may be understood by comparing it with the following places. Enter into <a id="l3928"></a>the rock &amp; hide thee in the dust for the fear of the Lord &amp; for the <a id="l3929"></a>glory of his Majesty — ffor the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon <a id="l3930"></a>every one that is proud - &amp; upon all the high mountains — &amp; the Idols <a id="l3931"></a>he shall utterly abolish, &amp; they shall go into the holes of the rocks <a id="l3932"></a>&amp; into the caves of the earth for fear of the Lord &amp; for the glory <a id="l3933"></a>of  his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. <a id="l3934"></a>In that day a man shall cast his Idols of silver &amp; his idols of gold <a id="l3935"></a>which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles &amp; to <a id="l3936"></a>the bats to go into the tops of the ragged rocks for fear of the <a id="l3937"></a>Lord &amp; for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake <a id="l3938"></a>terribly the earth: Isa. 2. The High places of Aven the sin of <a id="l3939"></a>Israel shall be destroyed: the thorn &amp; the thistle shall come upon <a id="l3940"></a>their altar, &amp; they shall say to the mountains, Cover us, &amp; to <a id="l3941"></a>the hills, ffall on us: Hosea. 10.8. Men are here put for Idols <a id="l3942"></a>as in divers other places of Scripture. Thou hast played the <a id="l3943"></a>harlot with many lovers, yet return to me saith the Lord. - <a id="l3944"></a>- She commited adultery with stones &amp; with stocks: Ier. 3.1, 9. <a id="l3945"></a>So Baalim are called the lovers of Israel: Hosea 2.12, 13. &amp; <a id="l3946"></a>the Idols of Egypt Assyria &amp; Babylonia are called Egyptians <a id="l3947"></a>Assyrians &amp; Babylonians wherewith Israel &amp; Iudah commit <a id="l3948"></a>fornication: Ezek. 16 &amp; 23. The men therefore who hid them <a id="l3949"></a>selves in dens &amp; rocks of the mountains &amp; said to the rocks <a id="l3950"></a>ffall on us &amp; hide us, are Idols of all sorts which were now laid <a id="l3951"></a>aside in private places of the Cities or Temples untill the <a id="l3952"></a>buildings fell on them &amp; covered them in rubbish.</p>
<p id="par150">So then at the opening of the sixt Seal is predicted the <a id="l3953"></a>shaking, eclipsing, dissolving, falling departing &amp; vanishing <a id="l3954"></a>of the whole heathen Roman world, &amp; the abolishing of their <a id="l3955"></a>Idols. And this came to pass in the reign of Constantine <a id="l3956"></a>the great &amp; his successors &amp; can be applied to no other <a id="l3957"></a>period of time. Constantine a Christian overcame the heathen <a id="l3958"></a>Emperor Licinius, applied the donaria of the heathen Temples <a id="l3959"></a>to the building of Constantinople, caused the Idols to be thrown <a id="l3960"></a>down &amp; laid aside &amp; great numbers of them to be brought to Con<a id="l3961"></a>stantinople &amp; there exposed to the derision of the people; &amp; he <a id="l3962"></a>&amp; his sons interdicted the worship shut up the Temples &amp; threw <a id="l3963"></a>down the Altars &amp; the porches &amp; roofs of some of the Temples <a id="l3964"></a>&amp; let the rest go out of repair. And by this means the heathen <a id="l3965"></a>religion decayed so fast, that before the reign of their successor <a id="l3966"></a>Iulian the Apostate one half of the people of the Empire were <a id="l3967"></a>become Christians. But Iulian opened the Temples &amp; restored <a id="l3968"></a>the heathen worship &amp; Valentinian &amp; Valens tolerated it all their <a id="l3969"></a>reign. And therefore the prophesy of the sixth seal was not fully <a id="l3970"></a>accomplished before the reign of their successor Gratian. It was the <a id="l3971"></a>custome of the heathen Priests, in the beginning of the reign of  <a id="l3972"></a>every soveraign Emperor to offer him the dignity &amp; habit of Pontifex <a id="l3973"></a>Maximus. This dignity all Emperors had hitherto accepted of: but <a id="l3974"></a>Gratian rejected it,  threw down the Idols, interdicted the sacrifices,  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p97"> &lt;74r&gt; </span> and took away the revenues of the sacrifices &amp; salaries &amp; authority <a id="l3975"></a>of the Priests. And Theodosius followed his example. And Heathenism <a id="l3976"></a>afterward recovered it self no more, but decreased so fast that <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup> Pru<a id="l3977"></a>dentius about ten years after the death of Theodosius called the <a id="l3978"></a>heathens <em class="underline">vix pauca ingenia</em> &amp; <em class="underline">pars hominum rarissima</em>.  For when the Dragon that old Serpent called the <a id="l3980"></a>Devil &amp; Satan, the spirit of the heathen religion, was cast out of <a id="l3981"></a>the Roman throne, he came down among the Christian inhabitants <a id="l3982"></a>of the earth &amp; sea with great wrath; the heathens who then began <a id="l3983"></a>in great numbers out of temporal ends to profess the christian religion <a id="l3984"></a>bringing in among the Christians the vices  &amp; superstitions of <a id="l3985"></a>the heathen religion: &amp; thereby the conversion of the rest of <a id="l3986"></a>the heathens became more easy &amp; the old heathen religion quickly <a id="l3987"></a>ceased. And at the same time a new sort of Christian religion was <a id="l3988"></a>set up which was mixed of heathenism &amp; christianity &amp; in this Prophesy <a id="l3989"></a>is called worshipping the Beast &amp; his Image &amp; receving his mark &amp; <a id="l3990"></a>committing fornication with the whore of Babylon, &amp; in Daniel the <a id="l3991"></a>transgression &amp; abomination which maketh desolate or which turneth into a wilderness. <a id="l3992"></a>For this is that wilderness into which the woman fled &amp; where Iohn <a id="l3993"></a>saw her sitting upon the Beast.</p>
<p id="par151">This Beast with    his worshippers is the Man of sin <em class="underline">who opposeth &amp; exalteth him<a id="l3994"></a>self above every one that is called  a God or object of worship <a id="l3995"></a>that he may sit in the temple of God shewing himself that he <a id="l3996"></a>is a God,  and whom the Lord shall  consume with <a id="l3997"></a>the breath of his mouth &amp; shall destroy with the brightness of his coming</em>. For this <a id="l3998"></a>is exactly the character which is given the Beast in the Apoca<a id="l3999"></a>lyps. He is slain, revives, is deifed, has an Image set up to him <a id="l4000"></a>&amp; with his Image is worshipped by all men whose names are <a id="l4001"></a>not written in the book of life, &amp; is at length taken and destroyed <a id="l4002"></a>in the lake of fire by the Lord at his coming. <em class="underline">And now ye know</em>, <a id="l4003"></a>saith the Apostle Paul, <em class="underline">what withholdeth that he might be revea<a id="l4004"></a>led in his time. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work, <a id="l4005"></a>only that which letteth will let untill he be taken out of the way <a id="l4006"></a>&amp; then shall that wicked one be revealed — whose coming is <a id="l4007"></a>after the working of Satan with all power &amp; signes &amp; lying <a id="l4008"></a>wonders</em>. That which letted was the Roman Empire as the <a id="l4009"></a>ancient Christians affirmed by tradition, that is, the heathen Em<a id="l4010"></a>pire then standing. ffor till the heathen Empire was taken out <a id="l4011"></a>of the way it was impossible for a Christian dominion to rise up <a id="l4012"></a>in its room which should exalt it self above every God. This em<a id="l4013"></a>pire was taken out of the way at the opening of the sixt seal <a id="l4014"></a>as we have newly explained: &amp; at the opening of the seventh <a id="l4015"></a>seal the Man of sin was revealed.  For then the Beast rose out of the sea &amp;  was deified by his Priest the two horned Beast &amp; began to be worshipped with his Image by all nations. <a id="l4021"></a>This Prophesy is called The Revelation of Iesus Christ &amp; the revelation <a id="l4022"></a>is made by opening the seals in order untill the Man  of sin be re<a id="l4023"></a>vealed, whose coming  was with all signes &amp; lying wonders for setting up <a id="l4024"></a>the worship of dead men as you have heard above. The Apostle tells  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p98"> &lt;75r&gt; </span> us that the day of Christ shall not come <em class="underline">except there come a falling <a id="l4025"></a>away first &amp; that Man of sin be revealed the Son of perdition</em>. <a id="l4026"></a>There came a generall falling away by the setting up of Saint-<a id="l4027"></a>worship &amp; therefore the Man of sin was then revealed. The time <a id="l4028"></a>is best determined by the holding of the four winds.</p>

<p id="par152">At the opening of the fourth seal the Empire was invaded <a id="l4030"></a>on all hands by barbarous nations so as to be in great danger <a id="l4031"></a>of falling: but Dioclesian &amp; his colleagues repulsed the invaders <a id="l4032"></a>&amp; restored the Empire to a flourishing &amp; formidable state &amp; <a id="l4033"></a> in this glory it continued during the reign of Constantine <a id="l4034"></a>the great &amp; his sons.

Thus <a id="l4135"></a>far Pacatus. And as Theodosius kept the Empire quiet so he left <a id="l4136"></a>it quiet at his death.

And first Ruffin called <a id="l4149"></a>into the eastern empire the barbarous nations who lay next it, &amp; they <a id="l4150"></a>harrassed all that empire for about 11 or 12 years together &amp; shook it <a id="l4151"></a>with incredible violence: &amp; then Stilico called into the Western Em<a id="l4152"></a>pire the rest of the barbarous nations who ruined that Empire &amp; <a id="l4153"></a>brake it into ten kingdoms. And these wars the Romans <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> looked <a id="l4154"></a>upon as the effect  &amp; consequence of the former war wherein <a id="l4155"></a>Valens perished, &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> sometimes dated them from the beginning of <a id="l4156"></a>that war with the Goths Huns &amp; Alans, as if Theodosius had not put <a id="l4157"></a>a full end to that war but only restrained it by force during his <a id="l4158"></a>warlike reign, the barbarous nations lying ready to pursue their <a id="l4159"></a>hostilities so soon as the restraint should be taken off. Which I note <a id="l4160"></a>because it is the character of the winds. ffor the winds were held by <a id="l4161"></a>force that they should not hurt the earth &amp; sea (or Eastern &amp; Western <a id="l4162"></a>Empires) till after a certain time, &amp; continued ready to break out &amp; <a id="l4163"></a>blow upon them so soon as the restraint should be taken off. By these <a id="l4164"></a>winds I understand, not civil wars but forrein invasions, such winds as <a id="l4165"></a>were held at the four corners of the earth or borders of the Empire &amp; <a id="l4166"></a>blew upon it from thence, the armies of forreign nations <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 77r resumes &gt; </span> invading the Empire  on all sides successively. These winds hurt <a id="l4167"></a> the earth &amp; <a id="l4168"></a>Sea, or, as is afterwards represented, a third part of the  things in Earth Sea rivers sun Moon &amp; <a id="l4170"></a>stars,  that is a third part of the world politick considered <a id="l4171"></a>in this prophesy.

Another third part is the  Latine Empire stricktly <a id="l4173"></a>called the Sea, &amp; another third part is the winds which hurt them, <a id="l4174"></a>that is the nations which invade the Greek &amp; Latine Empires, &amp; <a id="l4175"></a>more especially the nations of Dacia. For Dacia being conquered <a id="l4176"></a>by Trajan remained a Province of the Roman Empire for many <a id="l4177"></a>years, &amp; at length the empire brake into three principal parts <a id="l4178"></a>the kingdom of Dacia, the Greek Empire &amp; the Latine Empire. And <a id="l4179"></a>the kingdom of Dacia in the reign of Dioclesian &amp; Constantine the <a id="l4180"></a>great &amp; his  successors became very potent &amp; of great extent so as <a id="l4181"></a>in the reign of  its last king Ermaneric to equal or exceed France <a id="l4182"></a>&amp; Germany together. And out of this kingdom came the nations which <a id="l4183"></a>invaded the Empire on the four sides of Rome &amp; thereby composed <a id="l4184"></a>the four winds which hurt the Earth &amp; Sea, viz<sup>t</sup> the nations of the <a id="l4185"></a>Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Vandals, Alans, Chatti, Burgundians, Gepides, Lombards, <a id="l4186"></a>Heruli, Rugi, Sarmatæ, Sclavi, Bastarnæ. Tacitus tells us that Hadrian <a id="l4187"></a>granted seats in Dacia to Catualda king of the Marcomans; &amp; the <a id="l4188"></a>Marcomans &amp; Quades  are found mixed with the Gothic nations which <a id="l4189"></a>invaded the Greek Empire in the reign of Arcadius. The Hunns also <a id="l4190"></a>seated themselves in Dacia &amp; from thence invaded the Romans. The <a id="l4191"></a>Salian Francks were a part of the western Empire &amp; continued subject to the Romans <a id="l4192"></a>till the winds began to  hurt the earth &amp; Sea.</p>

This silence  began with the  ceas<a id="l4201"></a>ing of the winds: for noise denotes war &amp; silence peace. With <a id="l4202"></a>the holding of the winds &amp; ceasing of all noise the times of <a id="l4203"></a>the seventh seal began.  After this silence there were an <a id="l4204"></a>hundred &amp; forty four thousand servants of God sealed out of all the <a id="l4205"></a>twelve tribes of Israel &amp; the rest received the mark of the Beast <a id="l4206"></a>&amp; thereby were initiated into his religion &amp; became the synagogue of Satan: &amp;  before the servants of God <a id="l4207"></a> were sealed an Angel offered their prayers with much incense <a id="l4208"></a>upon the golden Altar, in the time of silence &amp; then cast fire,  to the earth, <a id="l4209"></a> to sacrifice Gods Lot, &amp; at the sacrifice there were voices &amp; thunderings &amp; lightnings &amp; an earth<a id="l4210"></a>quake , which is to be understood <a id="l4211"></a>not of the lasting &amp; pernicious wars of forreign invaders,  <a id="l4212"></a>represented by the winds, but of the  religious war whereby those who would not worship the Image of the Beast were killed. After which the seven Angels prepared <a id="l4216"></a>themselves to sound their trumpets to seven great wars, the <a id="l4217"></a>four first of which are the four winds which blow from the <a id="l4218"></a>four corners of the earth &amp; were to hurt the earth &amp; the <a id="l4219"></a>sea &amp; the trees. These winds respect the city Rome as  <a id="l4220"></a>in the center &amp; blow in the same order that the four Beasts <a id="l4221"></a>appeared, the first being chiefly an eastern, the second chiefly <a id="l4222"></a>a western, the third chiefly a southern &amp; the fourth chiefly <a id="l4223"></a>a northern wind; &amp; they hurt the earth, the sea, the trees, the <a id="l4224"></a>ships, the mountains, the rivers &amp; the sun moon &amp; stars, that <a id="l4225"></a>is, the whole frame of the Roman Empire; &amp; extinguishing <a id="l4226"></a>the old dominion of Rome make way for a new dominion <a id="l4227"></a>of that city.

For Theodosius who had checkt <a id="l4249"></a>the barbarous nations died in Ianuary A.C. 395. And from <a id="l4250"></a>that time for ten or twelve years together all the eastern Em<a id="l4251"></a>pire was invaded &amp; most grievously afflicted by barbarous nati<a id="l4252"></a>ons, besides what it suffered by pestilence famin &amp; other disasters <a id="l4253"></a>For so soon as Theodosius was dead Ruffin to whom he left the <a id="l4254"></a>tuition of his eldest son Arcadius the eastern Emperor, thinking <a id="l4255"></a>to get that Empire to himself, called in the nations of the north. <a id="l4256"></a>And first Alaric with a great army of Goths &amp; other barba<a id="l4257"></a>rians, the very same year, rising out of Thrace where the <a id="l4258"></a>Emperor Theodosius had seated him, invaded Macedon sparing neither <a id="l4259"></a>towns nor men, &amp; going thence by Thessaly into Achaia <a id="l4260"></a>he rased almost the whole country, &amp; amongst other <a id="l4261"></a>cities Thebes &amp; Athens. Then rushing into Peloponnesus <a id="l4262"></a>he laid wast Corinth Argos &amp; Sparta with many other <a id="l4263"></a>cities &amp; from thence betook himself into Epire where he <a id="l4264"></a>continued the same  depopulations. And the next <a id="l4265"></a>year going out of Epire he over-ran Achaia &amp; for four <a id="l4266"></a>years together continued to wast it &amp; Epire &amp; the neigh<a id="l4267"></a>bouring Provinces with fire &amp; sword.</p>
<p id="par157"> In the winter after Alaric began these devastations, <a id="l4268"></a>A.C. 395, there brake into Thrace &amp; Pannonia from beyond <a id="l4269"></a>the frozen Danube by the invitation also of Ruffin a great body <a id="l4270"></a>of Huns Alans Ostrogoths Sarmatans Quades &amp; Marcomans, <a id="l4271"></a>who harassed those &amp; the adjacent regions for some years <a id="l4272"></a>together, but chiefly Thrace. And in the  same winter or spring following by the invitation of the same Ruffin there flowed <a id="l4274"></a>another great inundation of Huns from the regions of  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p105"> &lt;80r&gt; </span> Tanais &amp; Mæotis into both Armenias Syria Cappadocia &amp; <a id="l4275"></a>Cilicia. And besides all this, <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup> Thrace &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup> Asia smarted <a id="l4276"></a>very much under the depopulations caused by Gainas a Goth who being one of Arcadius's Generals &amp; turning Traitor <a id="l4277"></a><sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup> called into the Empire from beyond Ister great numbers <a id="l4278"></a>of Ostrogoths &amp; conspired with Tribigildus (or Targibilus) <a id="l4279"></a>another Goth who being set over some bands of Barbarians <a id="l4280"></a>in Asia, withdrew his obedience &amp; fell to depopulate Phrygia, <a id="l4281"></a>Pamphylia, Lydia, &amp; the adjacent regions. And after them <a id="l4282"></a>a great army of Huns under Vldin from beyond the Danube wasted Thrace &amp; the Isauri from the reccesses of the mountain Taurus over<a id="l4283"></a>spread first Armenia Cilicia Mesopotamia &amp; both Syrias <a id="l4284"></a>&amp; then all the lesser Asia to the very Hellespont, together <a id="l4285"></a>with the Island Cyprus: dividing themselves into many <a id="l4286"></a>little troops, that they might by overrunning all at once, <a id="l4287"></a>do the more mischief. Whence they were compared to <a id="l4288"></a>thieves. Nor did Egypt, Libya Cyrenaica, Pentapolis <a id="l4289"></a>&amp; the neighbouring parts of Afric suffer less by the <a id="l4290"></a>invading Mazaces &amp; Auxorians Austurians or Saturians <a id="l4291"></a>whose incursions began A.C. 396 &amp; were at the height <a id="l4292"></a>about seven years after. And Rhætia was also invaded by the Suevians.</p>
<p id="par158">In the mean while when Alaric had for five years <a id="l4293"></a>together harassed the regions of the Greeks, he determined <a id="l4294"></a>to invade the western Empire, &amp; passing out of Macedon into <a id="l4295"></a>Dalmatia Illyricum &amp; Pannonia <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n26-ref">[26]</sup> A.C. 400 depopulated also <a id="l4296"></a>those regions &amp;  while the Roman army was defending Rhætia against the Germans marched  into Venetia &amp; Tuscia <a id="l4298"></a>&amp; in a short time made himself master of the cities there <a id="l4299"></a>&amp; beseiged the Emperor Honorius at Hasta, so that every <a id="l4300"></a>one began to think of leaving their seats in Italy. But <a id="l4301"></a>Stilico the next Spring <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n27-ref">[27]</sup> A.C. 403 beat him first at Pollentia <a id="l4302"></a>with a difficult but notable victory &amp; then again at Verona. <a id="l4303"></a>And whilst these things were doing Radagaisus a Pagan &amp; king <a id="l4304"></a>of another dynasty of the Goths prepared a far greater army <a id="l4305"></a>then that of Alaric consisting of Goths Sarmatans &amp; Germans <a id="l4306"></a>to the number of four hundred thousand if we may believe <a id="l4307"></a>Zosimus or according to the least accounts <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n28-ref">[28]</sup> of two hundred <a id="l4308"></a>thousand &amp; <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n29-ref">[29]</sup> upward. With these he passed the Iulian Alps &amp; the regions <a id="l4309"></a>of Venetia &amp; having wasted many cities in the way beseiged <a id="l4310"></a>Florence, but was there beaten &amp; his army ruined by Stilico.</p>
<p id="par159">The grassation of Alaric in Greece is thus described by <a id="l4311"></a>Zosimus.<sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup> Alaricus e Thracia discedebat et in Macedoniam <a id="l4312"></a>Thessaliamque progrediebatur interjecta cuncta diruens. — Dein <a id="l4313"></a>aditu per Thermopylas in *<sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup> Græciam concesso, Barbari mox  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p106"> &lt;81r&gt; </span> ad expeditam agrorum direptionem et universum oppidorum excidi<a id="l4314"></a>um progrediebantur, viros quidem cujusvis ætatis interrimentos, pueros <a id="l4315"></a>autem et mulierculas gregatim una cum opibus universis ceu partam <a id="l4316"></a>prædam abigentes.

<p id="par160">Zosimus here writes that Attica &amp; the cities of Thebes &amp; <a id="l4333"></a>Athens escaped these flames but Baronius <sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup> out of Ierome Claudian <a id="l4334"></a>&amp; Eunapius proves the contrary. The passage of Claudian<sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup> is this</p>

<p id="par162">The following depopulations of the west by the same Alaric <a id="l4346"></a>is thus hinted by Socrates: Alaricus – Constantinopoli discedens <a id="l4347"></a>ad Occidentis partes transgressus est, cumque in Illyricum pervenisset <a id="l4348"></a>late cuncta vastari cœpit.

<p id="par163">Nor were these regions depopulated by Alaric only but by <a id="l4352"></a>other barbarians before him as is to be collected out of Claudians <a id="l4353"></a>poem de bello Gildonico written A.C. 398 where he speaks thus <a id="l4354"></a>of the western Empire.</p>

<p id="par167">The irruption of the Huns into Armenia &amp; the adjacent <a id="l4375"></a>provinces, Ierome who was then in the east describes thus:<sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup> <a id="l4376"></a>Quærentibus nobis dignum Fabiolæ habitaculum — ecce <a id="l4377"></a>subito discurrentibus nuncijs Oriens totus intremuit.

<p id="par184">In the end of the year 407 a great body of barbarous <a id="l4727"></a>nations, namely Goths, Vandals, Alans, Burgundians, Suevians <a id="l4728"></a>Alemans, Quades, Gepides, Herules &amp;c being invited from their <a id="l4729"></a>seats in Germany  by the treacherous Stilico, passed the <a id="l4730"></a>Rhene &amp; from that time invaded first Gallia &amp; then Spain <a id="l4731"></a>with great violence, &amp; the Franks on this side the Rhene <a id="l4732"></a>revolted &amp; called in other Franks from beyond the Rhene, <a id="l4733"></a>&amp; the Visigoths under Alaric leaving their seats in Pan<a id="l4734"></a>nonia to the Hunns came into Noricum A.C. 408 &amp; there <a id="l4735"></a>hearing of the death of Stilico who for conspiring with <a id="l4736"></a>them was slain  the same year 10 Kal.

<p id="par187">Thus at the sounding of the second Trumpet a great Moun<a id="l4851"></a>tain, the Metropolis of the Roman Empire was set on flames by war <a id="l4852"></a>&amp;  cast down with violence from the height of its honour &amp; glory <a id="l4853"></a>&amp; dominion &amp; sunk down in the Roman sea whose waters are peoples <a id="l4854"></a>&amp; multitudes &amp; nations &amp; tongues, the citizens who survived the <a id="l4855"></a>siege being thrown out dispersed &amp; scattered into all the Empire <a id="l4856"></a>&amp; sinking in the Roman waters into the lowest of dishonour <a id="l4857"></a>poverty &amp; misery. And tho the city was afterwards peopled again <a id="l4858"></a>yet it was but thinly peopled &amp; recovered it's temporal greatness <a id="l4859"></a>no more but was made subject to Ravenna which henceforward <a id="l4860"></a>became the Metropolis of this Empire. The sacking of old <a id="l4861"></a>Babylon by the Medes is in Ieremie's prophesies represented by that <a id="l4862"></a>citie's being called a destroying mountain &amp; rolled down &amp; made a burnt mountain (Ier. 51.25) &amp; by <a id="l4863"></a>its being covered with the sea (vers. 42) &amp; sinking in the waters of Euphrates like a stone &amp; not rising <a id="l4864"></a>from the evil which God brings upon it (vers. 63, 64.) And the fall of the <a id="l4865"></a>great city Babylon in the Apocalyps is also represented by burning <a id="l4866"></a>her with fire (Apoc 18.8) &amp; by casting a great stone like a millstone <a id="l4867"></a>into the sea, saying, Thus  with violence shall the great city <a id="l4868"></a>Babylon be thrown down &amp; shall be found no more at all (v. 21.) <a id="l4869"></a>And a figure of the very same kind is the casting a great moun<a id="l4870"></a>tain burning with fire into the sea. This figure was certainly <a id="l4871"></a>taken from Ieremie's prophesy, &amp; alludes unto it, &amp; signifies here <a id="l4872"></a>as well as there the great city Babylon burning &amp; sinking. There <a id="l4873"></a>it was the old Babylon &amp; here it is the new. There were many <a id="l4874"></a>other cities sackt &amp; taken in this war but all these are represented <a id="l4875"></a>in general by the third part of the ships which were destroyed. The <a id="l4876"></a>great mountain is the great city &amp; the great city in this prophesy is  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p121"> &lt;95r&gt; </span> Babylon. It signifies a particular city, a city greater &amp; more emi<a id="l4877"></a>nent then the rest, the Metropolis of the whole. For this <a id="l4878"></a>Prophesy takes notice of nothing in particular but what is <a id="l4879"></a>most eminent in the kind. Otherwise the interpretation would <a id="l4880"></a>be uncertain. In all the Roman history I meet with nothing be<a id="l4881"></a>sides the   ruin of Rome to which this figure of the <a id="l4882"></a>burning &amp; sinking mountain can be so well applied; &amp; in all this <a id="l4883"></a>prophesy there is nothing besides this figure to represent <a id="l4884"></a>the ruin of that city; an event so very considerable as to deserve <a id="l4885"></a>to be represented.</p>
<p id="par188">As for the wars in other parts of Italy &amp; in Pannonia <a id="l4886"></a>Noricum Gallia &amp; Spain I described them above where I shewed <a id="l4887"></a>the breaking of the western Empire into ten kingdoms, and <a id="l4888"></a>shall only subjoyn here a few passages by which you may <a id="l4889"></a>understand their violence. Ierome in his 11<sup>th</sup> Epistle ad <a id="l4890"></a>Gerontium written upon the first taking of Rome A.C. 409 thus describes the war then <a id="l4891"></a>raging in Gallia.

<p id="par192"><em class="underline">And the third Angel sounded &amp; there fell a great star <a id="l4988"></a>from heaven burning as it were a lamp</em> [the Emperor of the <a id="l4989"></a>west with his dominion consuming by war] <em class="underline">&amp; it fell upon the third part of the rivers</em> <a id="l4990"></a>[upon the kingdoms of the western empire which is a third part of the whole <a id="l4991"></a>subject of sacred prophesy] <em class="underline">&amp; upon the fountains of waters</em> [the <a id="l4992"></a>head cities of those kingdoms.] <em class="underline">And the name of the star is <a id="l4993"></a>called wormwood</em> [bitterness of affliction] <em class="underline">&amp; the third part of <a id="l4994"></a>the waters became wormwood, &amp; many men died of the wa<a id="l4995"></a>ters because they were made bitter</em> [i.e. the nations of the <a id="l4996"></a> western empire by the fall of the star were embittered with affli<a id="l4997"></a>ction, &amp; many died a death politique by the dissolution of that Empire.]</p>
<p id="par193">The figure of a great star burning as it were a <a id="l4998"></a>lamp &amp; falling from heaven into the waters, is of the same kind with <a id="l4999"></a>that of the great mountain burning with fire &amp; falling into the <a id="l5000"></a>sea. The only difference is that the mountain signifies <a id="l5001"></a>a reigning City &amp; the star a king with his body politique. <a id="l5002"></a>This figure is taken from Isaiah's prophesy against the <a id="l5003"></a>king of Babylon, where he thus compares that king <a id="l5004"></a>to the morning star falling from heaven.<sup class="note" id="n66-ref">[66]</sup> <em class="underline">How art <a id="l5005"></a>thou fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning <a id="l5006"></a>How art thou cut down to the grownd who didst weaken <a id="l5007"></a>the nations!

As the old Prophets represent the fall of old Babylon <a id="l5014"></a>by the falling of a burning mountain &amp; the fall of its king <a id="l5015"></a>by the falling of the bright morning star: so Iohn <a id="l5016"></a>represents the fall of new Babylon &amp; that of its king <a id="l5017"></a>by the falling of a great burning mountain &amp; by that <a id="l5018"></a>of a great star burning like a lamp. Certainly this <a id="l5019"></a>star cannot be applied to any thing more properly then <a id="l5020"></a>to the western Emperor. For tho several kingdoms <a id="l5021"></a>were now rent from him yet he retained still a great <a id="l5022"></a>dominion reigning over all Afric, Italy, Rhætia, Noricum, <a id="l5023"></a>Istria, Illyricum &amp; part of Gallia &amp; Spain.

<p id="par200">When the Romans had lost Afric the Emperor Majoranus <a id="l5191"></a>prepared great forces  to recover their loss <a id="l5192"></a>&amp; sailing to Afric laid seige to Carthage A.C. 458; but fell sick <a id="l5193"></a>&amp; was forced by the Vandals to retire without success. And the <a id="l5194"></a>Vandals thenceforward continuing very troublesome to both Empires <a id="l5195"></a>the Greek Emperor Leo A.C. 468 sent against them a navy of a thou<a id="l5196"></a>sand one hundred &amp; thirteen ships &amp; an hundred thousand men &amp; <a id="l5197"></a>recovered Sardinia &amp; Tripolis: but his fleet in sailing towards <a id="l5198"></a>Carthage was met by the fleet of the Vandals &amp; put to flight <a id="l5199"></a>with  great loss of ships &amp; men. But two years after this, the fleet <a id="l5200"></a>of the Greeks beat the fleet of the Vandals upon the coast of <a id="l5201"></a>Sicily &amp; forced them to fly to Carthage. Then Ricimer falling <a id="l5202"></a>out with the western Emperor Anthemius, beseiged him in Rome <a id="l5203"></a>A.C. 472, &amp; after the city had suffered much by famin &amp; pestilence took <a id="l5204"></a>it &amp; gave his soldiers the plunder. This was the third time that <a id="l5205"></a>Rome was taken &amp; plundered. In the mean time Geiseric <a id="l5206"></a>to recover him self, sollicited the Ostrogoths to invade both <a id="l5207"></a>empires; which they did in two bodies. But the western Emperor <a id="l5208"></a>Glycerius bought off those who entered Italy &amp; perswa<a id="l5209"></a>ded them to go into Gallia &amp; joyn themselves with those <a id="l5210"></a>of their own nation  the Visigoths, who would <a id="l5211"></a>give them seats.  The Visigoths received them &amp; being <a id="l5212"></a>much strengthened thereby made war upon the Romans <a id="l5213"></a>&amp; drove them out of Gallia. And now Odoacer king of Herules <a id="l5214"></a>&amp; Turcilings, nations which had warred under Attila, hear<a id="l5215"></a>ing that the western Empire was grown small &amp; poor &amp; <a id="l5216"></a>weak &amp; disturbed &amp; unable to defend it self, came with <a id="l5217"></a>an army over the Danube  through Noricum into Italy A.C. <a id="l5218"></a>476, beseiged &amp; took the Roman army in Pavia, marched <a id="l5219"></a>thence against the Emperor Augustulus, took Ravenna &amp; <a id="l5220"></a>Rome, &amp; in one year put an end to the western Empire. <a id="l5221"></a>All which is related by Sigonius in his book De Occidentali <a id="l5222"></a>Imperio.</p>

<p id="par212" class="i0">By this Edict it is manifest that all sectaries or Separatists were <a id="l5475"></a>Hereticks in the sense of the Roman Laws. And therefore by <a id="l5476"></a>the laws above recited it was made a capital crime in <a id="l5477"></a>Afric to separate from the Roman Catholick &amp; meet <a id="l5478"></a>apart for divine worship upon any pretence whatever. The <a id="l5479"></a>Roman Catholicks by their worshipping dead men, their magical <a id="l5480"></a>use of the signe of the cross, their spirit of persecution <a id="l5481"></a>manifested in these &amp; former laws &amp; the great load of heathen <a id="l5482"></a>superstitions &amp; other humane inventions with which their <a id="l5483"></a>worship was soiled, gave sufficient cause of separation, &amp; yet <a id="l5484"></a>by these laws made it death to separate. This is killing <a id="l5485"></a>men for not being of the Roman Catholick communion. This <a id="l5486"></a>is that sort of persecution by which the Beast made war with <a id="l5487"></a>the saints &amp; overcame them, that sort of persecution by which <a id="l5488"></a>the Whore of Babylon became drunken with the blood of Saints <a id="l5489"></a>&amp; of the martyrs of Iesus. Theodosius indeed put forth a law <a id="l5490"></a>for punishing the Encratites &amp; Saccofori with death, which was <a id="l5491"></a>a very ill president; but those laws respected only two or <a id="l5492"></a>three particular sorts of ill men, these were against all men <a id="l5493"></a>who were  of any other then the Roman Catholick communion. And since <a id="l5494"></a>they were the first laws of this this kind &amp; gave a beginning to <a id="l5495"></a>that sort of persecution which in this prophesy is called shedding <a id="l5496"></a>the blood of Saints &amp; prophets, the crime of the Africans was <a id="l5497"></a>the greater &amp; the punishment was suitable. For when <a id="l5498"></a>the Vandals first invaded Afric that country was very <a id="l5499"></a>populous &amp; in a very flourishing condition, consisting of about <a id="l5500"></a>seven hundred bishopricks, which was more then in all France <a id="l5501"></a>Spain &amp; Italy together: but by the wars between the <a id="l5502"></a>Vandals Romans &amp; Moors it was depopulated to that <a id="l5503"></a>degree, that in the reign of Iustinian who overthrew the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p136"> &lt;110r&gt; </span> kingdom of the Vandals, it was rare &amp; next to a miracle <a id="l5504"></a>for a travellour to see a man. Procopius endeavours to <a id="l5505"></a>make Iustinian guilty of this devastation. Africam late adeo <a id="l5506"></a>patentem ita perdidit (saith Procopius) ut iter facienti <a id="l5507"></a>hominem conspicere rarum sit ac miraculo propinquum <a id="l5508"></a>Atqui Vandalorum qui arma ferrent fuerant ibi millia <a id="l5509"></a>octoginta. Mulierum puerorum servitiorum nunierum quis <a id="l5510"></a>dixerit? Iam Afrorum tum urbes habitantium tum agros <a id="l5511"></a>colentium tum mari viventium tanta erat (nam ipse <a id="l5512"></a>vidi) multitudo ut ab homine nullo exprimi possit. His <a id="l5513"></a>autem plures multo Mauri. Omnes illi cum fæminis <a id="l5514"></a>ac sobole stirpitus interiere.

Quare siquis dixerit interijsse <a id="l5517"></a>in Africa quinquies decies centena hominum millia, <a id="l5518"></a>minus, opinor, vero dixerit. How far Afric was dispeopled <a id="l5519"></a>by the wars of Iustinian &amp; how far by former wars during <a id="l5520"></a>all the reign of  the Vandals is not material <a id="l5521"></a>to  enquire. It suffices that by all those wars seditions &amp; per<a id="l5522"></a>secutions together it was wonderfully dispeopled &amp; left <a id="l5523"></a>almost destitute of inhabitants:  God pouring out <a id="l5525"></a>this Vial of wrath upon the Africans with so great se<a id="l5526"></a>verity, because they shed the blood of his saints &amp; were the first who set on <a id="l5527"></a>foot those bloody persecutions which have since been exercised in Europe &amp; continue in the Roman <a id="l5528"></a>Catholic Church to this day.</p>

<p id="par214">Now the four winds signifying four great &amp; durable <a id="l5604"></a>wars between the Romans &amp; Barbarians &amp; the fourth being <a id="l5605"></a>a northern wind in respect of Rome, &amp; there being no such <a id="l5606"></a>war after the fall of the western Cæsars during all the <a id="l5607"></a>reign of Odaocer Theodomir &amp; Athalaric: we may reccon <a id="l5608"></a>that the fourth wind, or war to which the fourth Trumpet <a id="l5609"></a>sounded, did not begin before Iustinian sent an army under <a id="l5610"></a>Belisarius &amp; other captains against the Ostragoths, &amp; put an <a id="l5611"></a>end to the peaceable &amp; happy times of the Romans under that  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p139"> &lt;113r&gt; </span> flourishing kingdom. Nor did it begin later, for this war hath all <a id="l5612"></a>the characters of the fourth wind. It began A.C. 435, which was <a id="l5613"></a>the year after Iustinian had conquered the Vandals in Afric &amp; <a id="l5614"></a>thereby put an end to the third wind. It was waged almost wholy <a id="l5615"></a>in Dalmatia, Liburnia, Venetia, Lumbardy, Tuscia &amp; the other <a id="l5616"></a>parts of the Empire of the Goths which lay northward from Rome. <a id="l5617"></a>It was very lasting: for it continued about seventy years; <a id="l5618"></a>twenty years between the Romans &amp; Ostragoths &amp; fifty years <a id="l5619"></a>more between the Romans &amp; other barbarous nations. And it <a id="l5620"></a>was very violent &amp; destructive. Procopius an eye witness <a id="l5621"></a>reccons that some millions of men perished in the war <a id="l5622"></a>between the Romans &amp; Ostrogoths. In taking Millain alone <a id="l5623"></a>the Goths slew all the males young &amp; old amounting <a id="l5624"></a>(as Procopius reccons) to three hundred thousand, &amp; sent the <a id="l5625"></a>weomen captives into Gallia to their allies the Burgundians. <a id="l5626"></a>And how many were slain or captivated in other sieges &amp; in Battels &amp; <a id="l5627"></a>inrodes or perished by famin &amp; pestilence the consequence of great wars, <a id="l5628"></a>is difficult to estimate. Rome her self was taken &amp; retaken <a id="l5629"></a>several times &amp; thereby her people were thinned, her old govern<a id="l5630"></a>ment by a Senate &amp; Consuls ceased, her Nobles were ruined &amp; <a id="l5631"></a>all her glory was extinct, &amp; after a war of seventeen years <a id="l5632"></a>continuance the kingdom of the Ostragoths fell whose kings had been <a id="l5633"></a>her husband &amp; her Sun. Thus at the sounding of the fourth Angel <a id="l5634"></a><em class="underline">the third part of the Sun was smitten &amp; the third part of the <a id="l5635"></a>Moon &amp; the third part of the stars so as the third part of <a id="l5636"></a>them was darkned: &amp; the day shone not for a third part of it <a id="l5637"></a>&amp; the night likewise</em>: that is, the Sun Moon &amp; Stars of the <a id="l5638"></a>third part were darkned.</p>
<p id="par215">After the ruin of the Gothick Empire which fell in the year <a id="l5639"></a>552, the <sup>a</sup> remainder of the Goths &amp; an army of Germans which <a id="l5640"></a>they had called in to their assistance continued the war three <a id="l5641"></a>or four years longer: &amp; then ensued the <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n80-ref">[80]</sup> war of the Heruli, <a id="l5642"></a>who, as <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n81-ref">[81]</sup> Anastasius tells us, <em class="underline">perimebant cunctam Italiam</em>, slew <a id="l5643"></a>all Italy.

In one of his <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n84-ref">[84]</sup> sermons to the people he thus expresses the great <a id="l5655"></a>consumption of the Romans by these wars: <em class="underline">Ex illa plebe in</em>-  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p140"> &lt;114r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">innumerabili quanti remanseritis aspicitis et tamen adhuc quo<a id="l5656"></a>tidie flagellæ urgent, repentini casus opprimunt novæ res et <a id="l5657"></a>improvisæ clades affligunt</em>.

<p id="par216">And thus did the <em class="underline">Sun</em>, that is, the kings of the barbarous <a id="l5730"></a>nations,  &amp; principaly those of the Lombards, scorch men <a id="l5731"></a>with great heat, as is exprest at the pouring out of the <a id="l5732"></a>fourth Vial, that is, with great heat of war. <em class="underline">And men were <a id="l5733"></a>scorched with great heat &amp; blasphemed the name of God <a id="l5734"></a>who had power over these plagues &amp; they repented not to <a id="l5735"></a>give him glory</em>. Blasphemy is in all this prophesy put for idolatry, <a id="l5736"></a>&amp; the names of blasphemy for the names of  fals Gods. <a id="l5737"></a>Men blasphemed the name of God because of the heat &amp; re<a id="l5738"></a>pented not: that is they invoked &amp; worshipped their fals Gods <a id="l5739"></a>because of their affliction &amp; were so far from repenting <a id="l5740"></a>that the more they were in affliction the more they wor<a id="l5741"></a>shipped them. Their being in affliction increased their devotion. <a id="l5742"></a>They invoked the saints before, but now they worshipped them <a id="l5743"></a>with more devotion &amp; ceremony. Now they began to invoke <a id="l5744"></a>them in their publick supplications or Litanies for averting  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p142"> &lt;116r&gt; </span> God's wrath. Now they began to make solemn processions to the Churches <a id="l5745"></a>where the supplications were to be made. Now they began to carry <a id="l5746"></a>the Pictures &amp; Images of Christ &amp; the Saints in solemn processions &amp; for pro<a id="l5747"></a>moting their veneration to pretend that they were ancient reliques. <a id="l5748"></a>&amp; to attribute miracles to them.  Now they began to be more offended at those men who opposed the placing <a id="l5749"></a>of Pictures &amp; Images in churches or demolished those which were <a id="l5750"></a>there placed then at those men who worshipped them. And now <a id="l5751"></a>they began also to say Masses for souls in Purgatory. And these things <a id="l5752"></a>were set on foot by the devotion of Pope Gregory the great, a man who <a id="l5753"></a>being a Monk was much inclinded to superstition,  &amp; <a id="l5754"></a>being learned &amp; very diligent &amp; well skilled in business he new <a id="l5755"></a>modelled the Roman service &amp; ceremonies &amp; by his preaching <a id="l5756"></a>writing visible humility &amp; sanctity of life &amp; pretence of mira<a id="l5757"></a>cles gained such a reputation among the  clergy &amp; <a id="l5758"></a>people as gave credit &amp; authority to his institutions, so that <a id="l5759"></a>they were received &amp; followed in after ages &amp; still continue <a id="l5760"></a>in use tho not without additions. Platina mentioning Gregories <a id="l5761"></a>book of the sacraments, his Kyrie eleisons &amp; Antiphonies &amp; his <a id="l5762"></a>institution of Litanies &amp; Stations, subjoyns. Quid plura de hoc <a id="l5763"></a>sanctissimo viro commemorem? cum omnis institutio eccle<a id="l5764"></a>siastici officij, veteris præsertim, ab eo sit inventa &amp; appro<a id="l5765"></a>bata: quem quidem ordinem utinam sequeremur. Non <a id="l5766"></a>abhorrerent hodie a lectione officij viri docti, quemadmo<a id="l5767"></a>dum faciunt propter barbariem nescio quam illi latini<a id="l5768"></a>tati et compositioni additam. This Pope appointed the  <a id="l5769"></a>Litanies called the greater supplications with a sevenfold <a id="l5770"></a>procession to the Church of the Virgin Mary, &amp; they tell <a id="l5771"></a>us that in making those processions upon Easter day A.C. <a id="l5772"></a>591 in the time of a great plague, the Image of the Virgin Mary painted by Saint Luke <a id="l5773"></a>was carried before him, &amp; an Angel was heard speaking <a id="l5774"></a>to the holy Virgin &amp; saying <em class="underline">Regina cœli lætare, Alle<a id="l5775"></a>lujah, quia quem meruisti portare, Allelujah, resurrexit <a id="l5776"></a>sicut dixit, Allelujah</em>. Which salutation being heard by <a id="l5777"></a>Gregory, he presently by divine inspiration completed it <a id="l5778"></a>after this manner, <em class="underline">Ora pro nobis Deum Allelujah</em>. And <a id="l5779"></a>soon after this the Angel appeared putting up his sword into <a id="l5780"></a>the scabbard, at the sight of which Gregory being comforted <a id="l5781"></a>told the people that God's wrath was appeased &amp; the <a id="l5782"></a>raging plague was at an end. And accordingly from <a id="l5783"></a>that time the plague abated. And henceforward, saith <a id="l5784"></a>Sigonius, the solemn Antiphony of the Church continued <a id="l5785"></a>as an argument of joy at the resurrection. These things <a id="l5786"></a>are affirmed by Sigonius who saith that he related them <a id="l5787"></a>as they are written in the Rituals of the Roman Church <a id="l5788"></a>And now by this great miracle the solemn Antiphony of  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p143"> &lt;117r&gt; </span> invoking the Virgin Mary being thus brought into  their publick <a id="l5789"></a>worship, it has not only continued in use ever since yearly upon Easter <a id="l5790"></a>day &amp; from thence to Trinity Sunday, but has been a president for <a id="l5791"></a>inserting other invocations of the Virgin Mary &amp; the rest of the <a id="l5792"></a>Roman Saints into the publick worship of that Church &amp; particularly into their Litanies so that there <a id="l5793"></a>is no solemnity, no ffast, no Sunday or festival no religious assembly no day in the year in which they do not worship one or more of <a id="l5794"></a>them by some prayer, vow,  hymn prostration or other act, besides their <a id="l5795"></a>saying Ave Marys to the Virgin as  frequently as Pater nosters <a id="l5796"></a>to God Almighty.</p>
<p id="par217">And as Gregory had the Image of the Virgin carried before him in <a id="l5797"></a>procession so Austin the Monck when he was sent by Gregory into England <a id="l5798"></a>went singing of Litanies with a silver cross &amp; the Picture of Christ <a id="l5799"></a>carried before him. And about the same time the armies of the Greek Emperors  had the picture of Christ carried before them in their <a id="l5801"></a>wars like the Ark before the armies of the Israelites: which picture was said to be sent by Christ to king Algar &amp; <a id="l5802"></a>was called ἀχειροπόιητος not made with hands, that it might be re<a id="l5803"></a>spected &amp; venerated as a very sacred relique. And when Serenus <a id="l5804"></a>Bishop of Marseils seing some Images set up &amp; worshipped <a id="l5805"></a>by some of the people brake the Images: Pope Gregory <a id="l5806"></a>reprehended him for it, saying, Permittimus imagines Sanc<a id="l5807"></a>torum quicunque eas formare voluerit tam in Ecclesia quam <a id="l5808"></a>extra ecclesiam propter amorem Dei &amp; Sanctorum ejus <a id="l5809"></a>adorare vero eas nequaquam cogimus. Frangere vel destruere <a id="l5810"></a>eas etiam siquis voluerit non permittimus. The same Gre<a id="l5811"></a>gory erected statues in the Oratory of his Monastery &amp; he <a id="l5812"></a>being ill at his stomach &amp; Eleutherius who was said to have <a id="l5813"></a>raised a dead man to life prostrated themselves before the Ima<a id="l5814"></a>ges in prayer to God, &amp;, saith Pope Hadrian, they were heard. He <a id="l5815"></a>erected Images also in Churches &amp; sent them as presents to his friends. <a id="l5816"></a>And about six years after his death, Pope Boniface IV by the consent <a id="l5817"></a>of the Emperor Phocas (whom Gregory had  courted) set up the Images <a id="l5818"></a>of the Virgin Mary &amp; all the Martyrs in the place of the Images of <a id="l5819"></a>Cybele &amp; all the heathen Gods in the Pantheon at Rome &amp; in their <a id="l5820"></a>honour instituted the annual feast of all saints.  The dedication of <a id="l5821"></a>the Pantheon Sigonius refers to the year  610 Indic. 13 when Pope <a id="l5822"></a>Boniface convened a Council at Rome as Beda relates. In the Office <a id="l5823"></a>for this ffestival there is this  prayer. <em class="underline">Angeli, Archangeli, Throni <a id="l5824"></a>et Dominationes, Principatus et Potestates, Virtutes Cœlorum, Che<a id="l5825"></a>rubim atque Seraphim, Patriarchæ et Prophetæ, Sancti legis <a id="l5826"></a>doctores, Apostoli, omnes Christi Martyres, Sancti Confessores, <a id="l5827"></a>Virgines Domini, Anachoretæ, Sanctique omnes, Intercedite pro <a id="l5828"></a>nobis.</em> There is also this Hymn. <em class="underline">Placare, Christe, servulis, Quibus <a id="l5829"></a>Patris clementiam, Tuæ ad tribunal gratiæ, Patrona Virgo postulat. <a id="l5830"></a>Et vos beata per novem Distincta gyros agmina, Antiqua cum <a id="l5831"></a>præsentibus Futura damna pellite.

<p id="par218" class="i0">These prayers &amp; hymns you may find in the Roman Breviarys <a id="l5837"></a>From all which it appears that after Pope Gregory began to <a id="l5838"></a>recommend the invocation of saints &amp; use of images &amp; to intro<a id="l5839"></a>duce them by miracles into the publick worship of the Roman <a id="l5840"></a>Church, this sort of devotion increased very fast so  that within <a id="l5841"></a>the space of 18 or 20 years all the saints began to be <a id="l5842"></a>solemnly invoked &amp; all their images erected &amp; venerated <a id="l5843"></a>in the Churches at Rome from whence this worship by the <a id="l5844"></a>Popes authority was soon  propagated into all the Roman Empire.</p>
<p id="par219">Men begain to invoke the Martyrs in their private <a id="l5845"></a>devotions &amp; to paint the Martyries with the histories of <a id="l5846"></a>their passions soon after the reign of Iulian the Apostate <a id="l5847"></a>as I gather from the writers of that age Basil, Epiphani<a id="l5848"></a>us,  Gregory Nyssen, Paulinus of Nola, Prudentius, Austin <a id="l5849"></a>of Hippo &amp; Euodius the earliest writers who mention the <a id="l5850"></a>painting of Martyries &amp; Churches. And about seventy <a id="l5851"></a>years after the reign of Iulian they began to place <a id="l5852"></a>images in Saint Peters Church at Rome. But before the <a id="l5853"></a>erecting of images became common the superstition was <a id="l5854"></a>checkt for a time by the wars of the barbarous nations <a id="l5855"></a>who differed in religion from the Roman Catholicks &amp; for <a id="l5856"></a>the most part reigned over the city of Rome. But after <a id="l5857"></a>the kingdom of the Ostrogoths fell &amp; Rome came into the <a id="l5858"></a>hand of the Exarchs of Ravenna who were Catholicks, &amp; <a id="l5859"></a>Agilulphus king of the Lombards by means of his Queen Theo<a id="l5860"></a>delinda became also a Roman Catholick (which came to pass in <a id="l5861"></a>the year  590) Pope Gregory &amp; his successors returned to <a id="l5862"></a>advance their gainful superstitions of invoking the saints <a id="l5863"></a>&amp; honouring their reliques &amp; images, &amp; at the same time <a id="l5864"></a>gaining the universal Bishopric became more able to <a id="l5865"></a>propagate it then before.</p>
<p id="par220">Vpon the death of Constantine the great the Pope began <a id="l5866"></a>to claim appeals from all the world &amp; was supported in <a id="l5867"></a>his claim by the western bishops, &amp; stifly opposed by the <a id="l5868"></a>eastern. This  ambition of the Western  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p145"> &lt;119r&gt; </span> Churches &amp; departure from the Eastern with intention of <a id="l5869"></a>subduing them, was one of the first acts of the Womans flying into <a id="l5870"></a>the wilderness. But she was humbled for a time first by the con<a id="l5871"></a>quest of the western Empire by the eastern in the reign of Constan<a id="l5872"></a>tius &amp; then by the sacking of Rome &amp; division of the western <a id="l5873"></a>Empire into ten kingdoms, eight or nine of which being erected by <a id="l5874"></a>northern Barbarians differed from the Catholicks in religion. This <a id="l5875"></a>oppression of the western Roman Catholicks made them unite more <a id="l5876"></a>firmly into one body under the Pope for strengthning themselves, <a id="l5877"></a>so that after a few years the acknowledgement of the Pope's <a id="l5878"></a>authority became  a part of the religion of the western Roman <a id="l5879"></a>Catholicks, &amp; to be converted to this religion implied the acknowledg<a id="l5880"></a>ment of the union of the Churches under him.  And thence it came to pass that the <a id="l5881"></a>ten kings upon their conversion to the catholick faith  united under the Pope as the common Bish<a id="l5883"></a>op of all their churches. And first the Francks submitted to <a id="l5884"></a>it upon the conversion of Clodoveus their king A.C. 496, <a id="l5885"></a>Remigius bishop of Rhemes being made the Pope's deputy <a id="l5886"></a>bishop over France.<sup class="note" id="n88-ref">[88]</sup> Then Spain submitted in the reign <a id="l5887"></a>of Reccarede A.C. 590 &amp; Lombardy the same year in <a id="l5888"></a>the reign of Agilulf king of the Lombards &amp; Brittain began <a id="l5889"></a>to submit A.C. 596 by the preaching of  Austin the <a id="l5890"></a>monck to the Saxons, &amp; the  Greek <a id="l5891"></a>Empire submitted by the grant of the Emperor Phocas A.C. 606. <a id="l5892"></a>Thus the ten kings began to be of one mind &amp; to agree &amp; give <a id="l5893"></a>their power &amp; strength &amp; kingdom to the Beast. And hence<a id="l5894"></a>forward by the Popes universal authority Images began <a id="l5895"></a>to be erected every where in churches after the example <a id="l5896"></a>of what was done in the Pantheon &amp; other churches at <a id="l5897"></a>Rome. And because the Church of Rome began now to <a id="l5898"></a>reign over the ten kings &amp; enticed them to this idolatrous <a id="l5899"></a>religion &amp; thereby became rich &amp; potent, she is hence forward <a id="l5900"></a>in this prophesy compared to a woman arrayed in purple &amp; scarlet &amp; decked <a id="l5901"></a>with gemms, who lives deliciously &amp; sits a Queen upon seven <a id="l5902"></a>mountains &amp; upon the ten horned Beast in a spiritualy barren <a id="l5903"></a>wilderness &amp; commits fornication with the kings of the <a id="l5904"></a>earth &amp; makes the nations drunk with the wine of her <a id="l5905"></a>fornication &amp; abounds with gold &amp; silver &amp; pretious stones &amp; <a id="l5906"></a>pearles &amp; fine linnen &amp; purple &amp; silk &amp; scarlet &amp; all things <a id="l5907"></a>of price &amp; enriches the merchants of the earth with her <a id="l5908"></a>costliness: &amp; in the prophesies of Isaiah she is elegantly <a id="l5909"></a>represented by the merchandizing city of Tyre in these words</p>

This prophesy cannot be applyed to the old <a id="l5922"></a>city Tyre in a litteral sence. For a whore is in sacred prophesies <a id="l5923"></a>put for the Church of God in a state of idolatry. God is her <a id="l5924"></a>husband &amp; by idolatry she forsakes him &amp; goes a whoring <a id="l5925"></a>after other Gods, &amp; commits fornication with the nations <a id="l5926"></a>&amp; kingdoms whose Gods she worships: and there is no other <a id="l5927"></a>city besides the great city represented by the Whore of Ba<a id="l5928"></a>bylon, which hath committed fornication with all the kingdoms <a id="l5929"></a>of the world upon the face of the earth, or as is exprest <a id="l5930"></a>in the Apocalyps, which hath made all nations drunk with <a id="l5931"></a>the wine of her fornication. Her merchandise is not like <a id="l5932"></a>the merchandise of old Tyre. It is the hire of her for<a id="l5933"></a>nication. It is holiness to the Lord. It is for them that <a id="l5934"></a>dwell before the Lord, that is, for the Priests. It is for <a id="l5935"></a>them to eat sufficiently &amp; to wear ancient or old-fashioned <a id="l5936"></a>cloathing suitable to the Priesthood, that is, it is for the <a id="l5937"></a>maintenance of the Priests. And I do not see how all these <a id="l5938"></a>things can agree to any other merchandising city then the <a id="l5939"></a>Whore of Babylon that great city who enriched the merchants <a id="l5940"></a>of the earth with her delicacies.

And in this obscurity she remained <a id="l5960"></a>till the end of the war A.C. 603 &amp; further till she recovered the <a id="l5961"></a>universal bishopric by the grant of the Emperor Phocas A.C. 606, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p147"> &lt;121r&gt; </span> so that the whole time of her obscurity was seventy years. <a id="l5962"></a>At the end of this time she turned to her hire &amp; began <a id="l5963"></a>to sing as an harlot &amp; commit fornication with all the <a id="l5964"></a>kingdoms of the [Roman] world upon the face of the earth. <a id="l5965"></a> For she begged the Pantheon of the Emperor Phocas the <a id="l5966"></a>next year, as I reccon by allowing two or three years <a id="l5967"></a>for cleansing &amp; repairing the Pantheon &amp; preparing Ima<a id="l5968"></a>ges to be set up in it before it was dedicated: &amp; hence forward erecting <a id="l5969"></a>Images in this &amp; other Churches she propagated her <a id="l5970"></a>idolatrous religion into all kingdoms by means of her <a id="l5971"></a>universal bishoprick, &amp; by this religion grew very <a id="l5972"></a>rich &amp; lived deliciously.</p>
<p id="par222">And now the wickedness of the Roman Catholicks <a id="l5973"></a>growing greater then before, their punishment is propor<a id="l5974"></a>tionaly increased. ffor an Angel (or, as some Manuscripts <a id="l5975"></a>have it, an Eagle) flyes through the midst of heaven <a id="l5976"></a>saying with a loud voice; Wo, Wo, Wo to the inhabitants <a id="l5977"></a>of the earth by reason of the other voices of the <a id="l5978"></a>Trumpet of the three Angels which are yet to sound.</p>

<p id="par225">Mahomet pretended to be called to the Office of a <a id="l6049"></a>Prophet in the 40<sup>th</sup> year of his  age A.C. 609 &amp; began <a id="l6050"></a>then to make disciples privately, &amp; in the 44<sup>th</sup> year of his <a id="l6051"></a>age he began to manifest his vocation at Mecha &amp; set open <a id="l6052"></a>the bottomless pit, &amp; in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of his vocation A.<a id="l6053"></a>C. 622 he fled from Mecha to Medina &amp; began to arm <a id="l6054"></a>his followers, that is, to bring Locusts out of the smoke. <a id="l6055"></a>He reigned ten years at Medina in which time he fought se<a id="l6056"></a>veral battels &amp; took Mecha   Bahraina, Tajifac, Sanaa, Gineda, Gjuxisja &amp; other chief cities of Arabia conquering almost all Arabia ffælix &amp;  Petræa &amp; there founding a considerable kingdom,  &amp; after his death his successor Abubecre in the first year of his reign prosecuted the war in Arabia &amp; enlarged the kingdom &amp; in the second year he sent an army to invade Chaldea &amp; the next year sent other forces to invade Syria which forces that summer  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p150"> &lt;124r&gt; </span> took Bosra the metropolis of the Idumeans at the entrance of <a id="l6063"></a>Syria, but before they took it he died at Medina in August <a id="l6064"></a>A.C. 634. The next year his successor Omar sent fresh forces <a id="l6065"></a>into Syria which put the Romans to flight &amp; after half a year's <a id="l6066"></a>seige took Damascus, &amp; the year following they won several <a id="l6067"></a>battels &amp; beseiged Ierusalem.</p>
<p id="par226">Hitherto the Califs reigned at Medina, but the next <a id="l6068"></a>year, A.C. 637 they translated the seat of their kingdom from <a id="l6069"></a>Arabia into Syria. ffor Omar made his son Governour of <a id="l6070"></a>Medina &amp; went himself into Syria &amp; took Ierusalem &amp; all <a id="l6071"></a>Phœnicia &amp; sent a great army to invade Egypt.

Which sucesses may be <a id="l6075"></a>recconed the beginning of their Empire. Before this year <a id="l6076"></a>they were only kings of Arabia but now they began to be Empe<a id="l6077"></a>rors of the East, having conquered Phœnicia, Syria Damascena, Chaldea, <a id="l6078"></a>part of Persia &amp; some part of Egypt, &amp; now  making Damascus the seat of <a id="l6079"></a>their Empire, &amp; Omar being the first Calif to whom they gave the <a id="l6080"></a>title of Imperator fidelium.

<p id="par227">The next year (A.C. 638) he took Antioch with all Syria, <a id="l6083"></a>&amp; the year following his forces became masters of Gran Cairo <a id="l6084"></a>in Egypt &amp; beseiged Alexandria, &amp; after 14 months seige <a id="l6085"></a>they took Alexandria A.C. 641, &amp; in a year or two more carried <a id="l6086"></a>on their conquest into Libya as far as Barca. And while these <a id="l6087"></a>things were doing westward his armies extended their conquests eastward <a id="l6088"></a>over Mesopotamia Assyria &amp; Persia as far as Bactria. All this was <a id="l6089"></a>done in the ten years reign of Omar. And his successors  <a id="l6090"></a> carried on the conquest eastward over all the kingdom of Persia, <a id="l6091"></a>southward over Thebais Æthiopia &amp; Nubia &amp; westward over all Barba<a id="l6092"></a>ry to the Ocean, &amp; then invaded  Spain, France, Italy, Greece <a id="l6093"></a>Asia minor &amp; all the sea coasts of Europe, vexing Europe with fre<a id="l6094"></a>quent incursions &amp; beseiging Constantinople several times.</p>
<p id="par228">While they reigned at Damascus the Monarchy rose up <a id="l6095"></a>to its full growth &amp; flourished in its vigour. At length Almansor <a id="l6096"></a>A.C.  762 gave commandment for the building of Bagdad, &amp; <a id="l6097"></a> it was built  in four years &amp; then became the seat of Empire, &amp; <a id="l6098"></a>Damascus remained only the Metropolis of the upper Syria, its <a id="l6099"></a>walls being pulled down before.  Almansor died <a id="l6102"></a>near Meccha A.C. 775, &amp; his son Mahadis was then made Calif <a id="l6103"></a>at Bagdat &amp; reigned there, &amp; the Monarchy flourished under <a id="l6104"></a>that Metropolis till about the year 870 &amp; then began to be shaken <a id="l6105"></a>with some intestine broiles but overcame them &amp; continued almost <a id="l6106"></a>entire till about the year 900, &amp; then began to fall in pieces. The <a id="l6107"></a>governour of Egypt revolted A.C. 882, but was reduced A.C. 905.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p151"> &lt;125r&gt; </span>The Caramites revolted A.C. 899 &amp; rent away Arabia Fælix <a id="l6108"></a>&amp; Petræa.

The Dailamites revolted A.C. 927 &amp; <a id="l6111"></a>within four years extended their kingdom over a great part of Media <a id="l6112"></a>&amp; Hycania &amp; in three or four years more under the conduct of Mar<a id="l6113"></a>dawigus &amp; Amaduddaulas took from the Calif Chorasan &amp; all Persia <a id="l6114"></a>The Calif A.C. 930 granted Mesopotamia &amp; Miafarekin to Nasiruddaulas <a id="l6115"></a>the grandson of Hamedan for an annual tribute, &amp; A.C. 933 he made <a id="l6116"></a>Abubecre Achsijd Prefect of Egypt &amp; then deposing him made one <a id="l6117"></a>Ahmed Prefect in his room. But Achsijd having obteined Syria invaded <a id="l6118"></a>Egypt in August A.C. 935 &amp; set up a new dominion over both regi<a id="l6119"></a>ons which lasted many years. And now the Empire of the Saracens <a id="l6120"></a>being broken into many kingdoms &amp; divided amongst temporal <a id="l6121"></a>Princes &amp; the remaining dominion of the Califs at Bagdad being <a id="l6122"></a>disturbed &amp; small &amp; in danger of falling: the Calif sent for Ma<a id="l6123"></a>humet the son of Rajici from Wasitum a city of Chaldea where <a id="l6124"></a>he reigned, &amp;  he came to Bagdad in November A.C.  936 <a id="l6125"></a>&amp; the Calif made him Emperor of Emperors &amp; surrendred to <a id="l6126"></a>him the army &amp; treasury &amp; all the temporal power of the <a id="l6127"></a>Califate, as is related by the Arabic Historians.

<p id="par230">Now since the Chalifs reigned at Medina as kings of Arabia <a id="l6186"></a>or some part thereof till the year 637, &amp; in that year translated <a id="l6187"></a>the seat of their kingdom into Syria &amp; began to enlarge it <a id="l6188"></a>into a great Empire by taking Ierusalem &amp; conquering all <a id="l6189"></a>Palestine &amp; part of Persia &amp; Egypt: if we date their empire <a id="l6190"></a>from that year (for by naming their king a destroyer in the <a id="l6191"></a>languages of the Hebrews &amp; Greeks is implied that he should <a id="l6192"></a>receive his name as king from destroying their countries;) &amp; if we <a id="l6193"></a>extend the reign of this monarchy under the Angel of the bottom<a id="l6194"></a>less pit, from that year inclusively to the end of the year 936. <a id="l6195"></a>in which the Chalif lost all his temporal power &amp; ceased to tor<a id="l6196"></a>ment the Romans: the whole duration of this great Mo<a id="l6197"></a>narchy will be just 300 years,  that is ten prophetick months  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p153"> &lt;127r&gt; </span> putting days for years &amp; recconing 30 days to a month. But <a id="l6198"></a>because there were two successive dynasties of this monarchy <a id="l6199"></a>the one at Damascus in Syria the other at Bagdad in Chaldea <a id="l6200"></a>&amp; because the monarchy is represented by Locusts &amp; the nature <a id="l6201"></a>of Locusts is to live only five months, they being hatched an<a id="l6202"></a>nually by the heat of the sunabout a month after the vernal Equinox &amp; laying <a id="l6203"></a>their eggs &amp; dying about the autumnal Equinox: the Prophet <a id="l6204"></a>for the decorum of the type divides the whole time into five <a id="l6205"></a>months &amp; five months: saying twice, that the Locusts tor<a id="l6206"></a>mented men five months; that is in all ten months. ffor <a id="l6207"></a>the repetition is not without a meaning. In this Prophesy <a id="l6208"></a>there is nothing superfluous. They reigned something less <a id="l6209"></a>then five months at Damascus &amp; something more at Bag<a id="l6210"></a>dad; five months at each place more or less; in both <a id="l6211"></a>places together ten months.</p>
<p id="par231">Elmacinus by dividing his history into three books distinguished the Empire of the Saracens into <a id="l6212"></a>three successive Dynasties, the first comprehending its rise &amp; increase <a id="l6213"></a>during the reign of the Orthodox Chalifs at  Medina &amp; Damas<a id="l6214"></a>cus, the second conteining its decrease during the reign of the  Abasides <a id="l6215"></a>at Bagdat untill they subjected themselves to temporal Princes (which two <a id="l6216"></a>Dynasties together, neglecting the small kingdom at Medina, interpreted <a id="l6217"></a>to be the twice five months reign of the Locusts under their king the <a id="l6218"></a>Angel of the bottomless pit:) &amp; the third Dynasty is the further con<a id="l6219"></a>tinuance of this Empire after its distraction &amp; division into several <a id="l6220"></a>kingdoms most of which were governed by Saracens &amp; some of them by <a id="l6221"></a>Turks. And this Dynasty, according to the Saracen Historians ended with <a id="l6222"></a>the year 1258. For Abulpharajius, who divides his History into <a id="l6223"></a>so many Dynasties as there had been supreme Empires since <a id="l6224"></a>the creation &amp; reccons this Empire of the Saracens in the ninth <a id="l6225"></a>place, extends this Empire from the time of their Prophet <a id="l6226"></a>Mahomet to the taking of Bagdad by the Tartars, &amp; there <a id="l6227"></a>concludes it, making the short  lived Empire of the Tartars <a id="l6228"></a>then founded upon the ruins of the Saracens &amp; Turks by Hulacu <a id="l6229"></a>to be the tenth Dynasty or supreme Empire &amp; their common <a id="l6230"></a>period to be the year 1258.</p>
<p id="par232">How much the Roman Catholicks both Greeks &amp; Latins <a id="l6231"></a>were tormented by the Saracens during all these three Dynas<a id="l6232"></a>ties is sufficiently related in the histories of those times. For <a id="l6233"></a>this plague fell upon both Greeks &amp; Latins: upon the Greeks <a id="l6234"></a>because it fell upon the men who had not the  seal of God <a id="l6235"></a>in their foreheads that is upon those who by the influence <a id="l6236"></a>of the two-horned Beast received the mark of the other <a id="l6237"></a>Beast; &amp; upon the Latines because <em class="underline">the fift Angel poured <a id="l6238"></a>out his Vial upon the seat of the Beast. And they gnawed <a id="l6239"></a>their tongues for pain &amp; blasphemed the God of heaven <a id="l6240"></a>because of their pains &amp; sores &amp; repented not of their deeds</em> <a id="l6241"></a>This plague was inflicted upon the Romans for their idolatry  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p154"> &lt;128r&gt; </span> and yet the more they were plagued the more they worshipped <a id="l6242"></a>their false Gods &amp; Idols: which worship is in this prophesy called <a id="l6243"></a>blaspheming God. ffor after the use of Images in Churches was <a id="l6244"></a>defended by Pope Gregory &amp; the Images of the Virgin Mary &amp; the <a id="l6245"></a>Martyrs were by the authority of Pope Boniface &amp; the Greek <a id="l6246"></a>Emperor set up in the Pantheon at Rome: such Images were set <a id="l6247"></a> up by degrees in all Churches being consecrated &amp; called <a id="l6248"></a>holy Images, &amp; the Catholicks grew more &amp; more superstitious <a id="l6249"></a>towards them till many of the people worshipped them with <a id="l6250"></a>such a worship as others took for Idolatry. Whereupon the <a id="l6251"></a>Greek Emperor Leo Isaurus A.C. 726 ordered all Images to be <a id="l6252"></a>demolished &amp; forbad the invocation of saints &amp; was excommu<a id="l6253"></a>nicated for it by the Pope. And after a long &amp; sharp controversy, <a id="l6254"></a>in which some of the Latine Churches sided with the Greeks, the Pope at <a id="l6255"></a>length got the victory. And the canonizing of Saints &amp; doctrine of <a id="l6256"></a>transubstantiation came in about the same time. And before the times <a id="l6257"></a>of this Trumpet expired the idolatry of the Roman Catholicks <a id="l6258"></a>arrived to the height.</p>
<p id="par233">While the Empire of the Saracens continued divided into <a id="l6259"></a>many kingdoms, the Turks under Seljuck revolted from the Tartars &amp; under the conduct of his grandson Togrulbec ( <a id="l6260"></a>called also Togra, Dogrissa, Tangrolipix &amp; Sadoc)  conquered Cho<a id="l6261"></a>rasan &amp; Persia, &amp; A.C. 1055 added Bagdad to their Empire &amp; made <a id="l6262"></a>that city the seat thereof, the Chalif sending for Togrulbec &amp; crown<a id="l6263"></a>ing him there.

Hulacu therefore advancing from the <a id="l6357"></a>east, after he had staid some time in Persia &amp; subdued it, <a id="l6358"></a>came to Bagdad Ian.22, A.C. 1258, &amp; in a day &amp; a night <a id="l6359"></a>compassed the city with a wall &amp; a ditch &amp; took it the 10<sup>th</sup> of <a id="l6360"></a>February following &amp; put an end to the Califate &amp; therewith to <a id="l6361"></a>the Empire of the Saracens. ffor the Saracens  reigned at <a id="l6362"></a>Bagdad during the last hundred years; but now Persia &amp; Chal<a id="l6363"></a>dea was in the hands of the Tattars, the regions upon Euphra<a id="l6364"></a>tes &amp; Tigris above Chaldea in the hands of the Turks, Egypt <a id="l6365"></a>in the hands of the Mamalukes, &amp; Mauritania in the hands of <a id="l6366"></a>the Moors.

<p id="par241">How violent &amp; terrible this invasion was may appeare by <a id="l6395"></a>Pope Alexander's writing at that time to all the Roman Catholic <a id="l6396"></a>Princes to exhort them to  advise with the Nobles &amp; great <a id="l6397"></a>men of their kingdoms about uniting all their powers for putting <a id="l6398"></a>a stop to the imminent danger by the suddein &amp; impetuous progress of <a id="l6399"></a>the Tartars which then threatened all the world.

<h2 id="hd44" class="cent">The third Wo</h2>
<p id="par249">The third Wo is ushered in with a prophesy of measuring the three courts <a id="l6553"></a>of the Temple &amp; Altar &amp;  people that worship therein &amp; leaving the outward <a id="l6554"></a>court unmeasured because it is given to the gentiles.  All which is a plain <a id="l6555"></a>allusion to the Babylonian Captivity &amp; the visions of Ezekiel thereupon. When <a id="l6556"></a>the Babylonians had  in some  measure captivated the Iews &amp; the de<a id="l6557"></a>struction of the City &amp; Temple was at hand Ezekiel saw in a vision  <a id="l6558"></a>a man sent out to mark all those who sighed &amp; mourned for the wickedness <a id="l6559"></a>of the people &amp; then six other men sent forth to  destroy the city. And <a id="l6560"></a>after the destruction of the city &amp; Temple he  saw   saw a man measure the <a id="l6561"></a>Temple in another vision,  which measuring signified that it should be rebuilt. And accordingly <a id="l6562"></a>in the reign of Cyrus &amp; Darius Hystaspis the  House &amp; its court &amp; the court <a id="l6563"></a>of the Altar &amp; a third court for the people called the weomens court was <a id="l6564"></a>built: but the outward Court was left unbuilt  during all the reign <a id="l6565"></a>of the Kingdom of Persia &amp;  at length when it <a id="l6566"></a>was built (which came to pass in the  reign of the Greeks &amp; high Priesthood of Simeon  Iustus) it <a id="l6567"></a>was given to the Gentiles &amp; called the Gentiles court,  <a id="l6568"></a> the kings of Syria being at the charge of building it.  And <a id="l6569"></a>In allusion to all this,  at the opening of the sevent <a id="l6570"></a>Seal, an Angel seals out of all Israel an hundred forty &amp; four thousand <a id="l6571"></a>with the seal of God before the four winds hurt the earth &amp; sea,  &amp; another Angel commands Iohn to  measure the Temple &amp; <a id="l6573"></a>Altar &amp; them that worship therein to signify that the winds should ruin <a id="l6574"></a>the first Temple &amp;  that the sealed servants of God should <a id="l6575"></a>be preserved from the fury of the winds &amp; out of them a new Temple be built <a id="l6576"></a>up to God.  The first Temple was represented by the  woman in <a id="l6577"></a>heaven cloathed with the Sun.  By the division of the  Roman <a id="l6578"></a>Empire she fled into the Wilderness &amp; became the  Church of the <a id="l6579"></a>Western Empire. And this Church by the blowing of the four winds <a id="l6580"></a> &amp; breaking of the western Empire into ten kingdoms   <a id="l6581"></a>under the barbarous nations which invaded it was shattered &amp; broken <a id="l6582"></a>in pieces &amp; in a manner ruined as to its outward frame. And the people of God who would not <a id="l6583"></a>invoke the Saints &amp; worship dead men, but  separated from the Saint worshippers,  <a id="l6584"></a> were rescued &amp; protected by the barbarous nations from the great vio<a id="l6585"></a>lence of the Roman laws &amp; began again to meet for the worshipping <a id="l6586"></a>of God , &amp; by meeting  apart beame the second Temple. ffor the <a id="l6587"></a>Roman Laws were very severe against all persons whatsoever who <a id="l6588"></a>met  to worship God in any other assemblies then those of the <a id="l6589"></a>Roman Catholicks, confiscating the Churches  or houses where they <a id="l6590"></a>met &amp; either laying heavy penalties upon the persons  who met or seizing their estates <a id="l6591"></a>&amp; banishing them from humane society &amp;  beginning in Afric to <a id="l6592"></a>punish them with death &amp; laying heavy punishments also upon the <a id="l6593"></a>Iudges who  did not put these laws in execution, &amp; de<a id="l6594"></a>claring all those to be hereticks who  differed   from the Catholick Church in any thing how  <a id="l6596"></a>light or small soever, all which may be seen in the Laws of Theodosius <a id="l6597"></a>&amp; his sons now extant in the Theodosian Code. But in the kingdoms  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p164"> &lt;136r&gt; </span> erected by the barbarous nations these laws were laid asside &amp; all <a id="l6598"></a>people who were dissatisfied with Saint-worship or  Cross-worship <a id="l6599"></a>or with any other of the Roman superstitions had full liberty to <a id="l6600"></a>separate from them &amp; to meet apart, the barbarians being  enemies <a id="l6601"></a>to the  Empire &amp; for that reason  favouring <a id="l6602"></a>those who differed from it in religion.</p>
<p id="par250">So then as the Iews committed Idolatry &amp; the Babylonians made war <a id="l6603"></a>upon them for their sin &amp; destroyed their Temple &amp; afterwards gave <a id="l6604"></a> leave to  the remainder of them who feared God to build a second <a id="l6605"></a>Temple: so the Barbarous nations invaded the Roman   offenders <a id="l6606"></a>&amp;   rent their Church assunder &amp; gave leave to the residue who feared God to build <a id="l6607"></a>a new one. </p>
<p id="par251">And as the second Temple of the Iews continued about 200 years <a id="l6608"></a>without an outward court &amp; then had an outward court erected for the <a id="l6609"></a>Gentiles; so this new Temple of the Christians continued without an outward <a id="l6610"></a>court till the ten kings were converted to the Roman Catholick faith &amp; <a id="l6611"></a>the Roman  Church spreading it self over all the west  <a id="l6612"></a>&amp; setting up the worship of images became  Gentiles  in all respects &amp; trode down the holy city &amp;  had the outward court  <a id="l6614"></a>given to them.  And henceforward the Whore of Babylon rode <a id="l6615"></a>upon the ten horned Beast &amp;  the Beast acted &amp; was worshipped by all whose names <a id="l6616"></a>were not written in the book of life &amp; the  whore was fed in the wilderness <a id="l6617"></a>by the Merchants of the earth &amp; faired deliciously &amp; the two witnesses (they that worship in the second Temple) put on sackcloth. And in this <a id="l6618"></a> state the Western Empire continues a time times &amp; half a time or 42 months <a id="l6619"></a>or 1260  prophetic days.  All this happens before the end of the second Wo,  &amp; by consequence before the fall of the Turkish Empire <a id="l6628"></a>ffor after the death resurrection &amp; ascention of the two Witnesses <a id="l6629"></a>&amp; fall of the tenth part of the great City it's added The second Wo is past <a id="l6630"></a> &amp; behold the third Wo cometh quickly. The second Wo is past <a id="l6631"></a>that is the last act of hostility of the Turks against the Roman <a id="l6632"></a>Empire is past.  That act may be <a id="l6633"></a>past at the fall of the tenth part of the great city: but the Turkish Empire <a id="l6634"></a>it self may notwithstanding continue till the third Wo.</p>

<p id="par264">And [in the contention]. such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he  corrupt by <a id="l6818"></a>flatteries [&amp; cause them to apostatize] but the people that  do know their God shall be strong <a id="l6819"></a>&amp; act.
