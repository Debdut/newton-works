<p id="par1">As Daniels Prophesies consist of two parts a Vision or Prophesy, &amp; an Inter<a id="l1"></a>pretation of the Prophesy, so  doth the Apocalyps. The Prophesy ends with the <a id="l2"></a>sounding of the seventh Trumpet &amp; the Interpretation begins with the words <a id="l3"></a><em class="underline">And the Temple of God was opened in heaven, &amp; there was seen in his Temple the <a id="l4"></a>Ark of his testament</em> &amp;c</p>
<p id="par2">The Prophesy begins with opening the seals of the prophetick book shut <a id="l5"></a>up by Daniel till the time of the end. And the first six seals are opened succes<a id="l6"></a>sively in one continued order of time: but the times which follow the affairs of <a id="l7"></a>the sixth seale  &amp; begin with the opening of the seventh seale are thric<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l8"></a>described. First by the sealing of the 144000 servants of God in their forheads to preserve <a id="l9"></a>them from the plagues  wherewith the four winds were to <a id="l10"></a>hurt the earth &amp; the sea &amp;c at the sounding of the first four trumpets; &amp; by the <a id="l11"></a> great multitude which appeared afterwards coming out of the great tribulation <a id="l12"></a>with palms in their hands. Secondly by the opening of the seventh seale &amp; sounding <a id="l13"></a>of the first six Trumpets. And thirdly by the descent of an Angel with the <a id="l14"></a>Book of Prophesy opened in his hand &amp; Iohn's prophesying again out of  <a id="l15"></a>it concerning a second Temple which he describes by measuring the court of the Temple <a id="l16"></a>or separate place &amp; the court of the Altar or Priests court, &amp; the court of them that <a id="l17"></a>worship therein or the new Court called in the second Temple the weomens court: &amp; his <a id="l18"></a>leaving the outward Court or Court of the people unmeasured because it is given to the gentiles <a id="l19"></a> during <a id="l20"></a>forty &amp; two months or a thousand two hundred &amp; sixty  prophetic days which signify <a id="l21"></a>so many years, during all which time the two witness<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>es<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> were to prophesy in saccloth &amp; smite the Earth with the plagues of the Trumpets</p>
<p id="par3" class="i0"> These Witnesses were called the two Candlesticks standing before God , that is two of the seven golden <a id="l22"></a>Candlesticks which had been placed in the first Temple,   &amp; were now placed in the second. That Temple <a id="l25"></a>stood till the Woman fled into the wilderness &amp; the Dragon by the assistance <a id="l26"></a>of the two horned Beast made war upon the remnant of her seed, &amp; by ex<a id="l27"></a>communication dissolved all their Churches for not receiving the mark &amp; <a id="l28"></a>name &amp; number of the Beast, &amp; then a new Temple was built  as is signified by the command to measure the Courts of the Temple &amp; altar &amp; <a id="l30"></a>them that worship therein &amp; to leave  out the outward Court &amp; measure it not <a id="l31"></a>because it is given to the Gentiles. The outward Court is the outward form of <a id="l32"></a>religion &amp; Church government. This was given to the Gentiles who  re<a id="l33"></a>ceived the mark &amp; name &amp; number of the Beast, &amp; trode down the holy City <a id="l34"></a>forty &amp; two months;  &amp; those that worship in the inward Court, <a id="l35"></a>the Court of sincerity &amp; truth, are the 144000 who were sealed with the seale of God out <a id="l36"></a>of all the twelve Tribes of Israel, &amp; stand on mount Sion &amp; on the sea of glass <a id="l37"></a>with the name of God in their foreheads. And those among them who teach &amp; <a id="l38"></a>testify the truth are represented by two of the seven Candlesticks remaining <a id="l39"></a>in the second Temple, as being propagated from the Churches of Smyrna &amp; <a id="l40"></a>Philadelphia who suffered tribulation &amp; kept the word of Gods patience. The other <a id="l41"></a>five churches of Asia were found faulty  &amp; threatned if they did not repent, <a id="l42"></a>but these two were without fault, &amp; so were the only two Candlesticks fit <a id="l43"></a>to represent the  144000 which were without fault. And as the seven <a id="l44"></a>  Candlesticks or Churches of Asia  joyntly &amp; severally <a id="l45"></a> were types of the whole Church Catholick &amp; with their Lamps illuminated the whole during the times of the first Temple <a id="l46"></a>without dividing that whole Church into seven parts: so the two Candlesticks or two Chur<a id="l47"></a>ches of Asia were types of  those that worshipped in the inward Court of the second Temple <a id="l48"></a> &amp; illuminated them with their lamps  during <a id="l49"></a>all the times of that Temple, without dividing them into two parts. </p>

For then the kingdoms of this world <a id="l56"></a>become the kingdoms of God &amp; his Christ &amp; he reigns thenceforward for ever &amp; <a id="l57"></a>ever, &amp; the dead are judged.</p>

<p id="par7">The Interpretation of this Prophesy begins with the opening of a door in <a id="l74"></a>heaven, &amp; the vision of a woman representing the primitive Church Catholick <a id="l75"></a>&amp; of a persecuting Dragon representing the heathen Roman Empire. And this Prophesy continues <a id="l76"></a>downwards  till the servants of God are sealed with the seal of God in their foreheads <a id="l77"></a>&amp; the rest receive the mark of the Beast,  <a id="l78"></a>&amp; further till the everlasting Gospel is preached to every nation  &amp; kindred &amp; <a id="l79"></a>tongue &amp; people by which the two witnesses ascend up to heaven in a cloud &amp; become <a id="l80"></a>the palm-bearing multitude, &amp; till great Babylon is fallen once &amp; again, &amp; till the <a id="l81"></a>patience of the saints in the great tribulation, &amp; till the day of Iudgment represented <a id="l82"></a>by the harvest &amp; vintage. Then the Prophet returns back to the vision of them <a id="l83"></a>that  worshipped in the inner court of the temple &amp; saw them standing there as it were on the <a id="l84"></a>sea of glass, having gotten the victory over the Beast &amp; over his Image &amp; over his <a id="l85"></a>mark &amp; over the number of his name when all the rest  received his mark  <a id="l86"></a>in their foreheads. And then the seven Angells which had the seven last plagues <a id="l87"></a> pour out their Vialls of wrath which denote the same plagues with those of the <a id="l88"></a>Trumpets. For in both cases the first plague falls upon the earth the second <a id="l89"></a>upon the sea, the third upon the rivers &amp; fountains of water, the fourth upon the <a id="l90"></a>sun, the fift upon those that had not the seal of God in their foreheads &amp; upon the <a id="l91"></a>seat of the Beast, the sixt upon the great river Euphrates, &amp; the seventh  introduced the day of judgment. Then the Prophet returns back to the <a id="l93"></a>times next preceding the  ascent of the Beast out of the abyss or sea &amp; the rise <a id="l94"></a>of his ten horns &amp; describes this Beast &amp; his horns &amp; the woman sitting upon him <a id="l95"></a>in the wilderness, &amp; proceeds in the description till the day of judgment. These <a id="l96"></a>are the three parts of the Interpretation.</p>
<p id="par8">For understanding this Prophesy, the allusions which it hath to the Feast <a id="l97"></a>of the seventh month &amp; to the worship of God in the Temple are also <a id="l98"></a>to be considered. On the first day of that month the High Priest dressed the <a id="l99"></a>lamps in the morning. And this is alluded in the first vision where the Son of <a id="l100"></a>man in the  habit of the High Priest appears in the midst of the seven candlesticks with  seven <a id="l101"></a>starrs in his right hand which are the seven lamps appearing like a rod of <a id="l102"></a>seven starrs as it were in his right hand while he dresses them. And this dress<a id="l103"></a>ing he performs by sending seven Epistles to the Angels of the Seven Churches of Asia repre<a id="l104"></a>sented by the seven starrs, &amp; by those Angels to their Churches represented by the Candle<a id="l105"></a>sticks. These Epistles contein admonitions against the approaching Apostacy &amp; <a id="l106"></a>therefore relate to the state of the primitive Church  when that Apostacy <a id="l107"></a> began to work strongly &amp; before it prevailed. The visions <a id="l108"></a>at the opening of the first four seales relate only to the state of the  <a id="l109"></a>Roman heathen Empire.  So long the primitive Church continued in its <a id="l110"></a>purity, &amp;   then it began to want admonitions. And the Apostacy prevailed at <a id="l111"></a>the opening of the seventh seal.</p>
<p id="par9">After the Lamps were dressed,  a Trumpet sounded to the morning <a id="l112"></a>sacrifice. And Iohn saw the door of the Temple opened, &amp; standing at the eastern gate of the peoples court he <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>saw that<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> a throne was set <a id="l113"></a>videlicet the Mercy seat upon the Ark of the Testament  respected by the Iews as the <a id="l114"></a>throne of God Exod 25.22. &amp; Levit 16.2 &amp; Num. 7.89. &amp; Psal. 99.1. And he that sat on <a id="l115"></a>it was to look upon like Iasper &amp; Sardine stone, that is of a Olive colour the Iews being of that colour <a id="l116"></a>And a rainbow was about the throne the embleme of glory &amp; an argument that the sun shined then in the east. And round about the throne were <a id="l117"></a> four &amp; twenty seats, the 24 chambers of the Princes of the Priests twelve on each side of the Priests Court; &amp; upon the <a id="l118"></a>seats 24 Elders, sitting with crowns on their heads, the Princes of the 24 courses of the Priests. And out of the <a id="l119"></a>Throne proceeded lightnings &amp; thundrings, the fire of the Altar at the morning <a id="l120"></a>sacrifice &amp; the song of the Levites at the Eastern Gate of the Priests court appearing <a id="l121"></a>to Iohn like lightnings &amp; thundrings proceeding from throne. And there were seven <a id="l122"></a>lamps burning  in the Temple before the throne which are the seven <a id="l123"></a>spirits of God that is the Angels of the seven Churches of Asia. And before the <a id="l124"></a>throne was a sea of glass clear as Crystal, the brazen sea between the Porch of the temple &amp; <a id="l125"></a>the altar filled with water cleer as crystal. And in the midst of the throne <a id="l126"></a>&amp; round about the throne,  were four Beasts full of eyes before &amp; <a id="l127"></a>behind, that is one before the throne &amp; one behind the throne appearing to Iohn <a id="l128"></a>as in the midst of the throne &amp; one on either side to represent by the multitud<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l129"></a>of their eyes the people standing in the four sides of the peoples Court. And the <a id="l130"></a>first Beast was like a Lion, &amp; the second was like a calf, &amp; the third  <a id="l131"></a>had the face of a man &amp; the fourth was like a flying Eagle. The</p>

<p id="par12">In  this Prophesy the festivals of the seventh month  are alluded unto <a id="l153"></a>&amp; the dressing of the Lamps &amp; performing of the morning sacrifice hith<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>er<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><a id="l154"></a>to described may be understood to be upon the morning of the first day of <a id="l155"></a>that month. Vpon the tenth day of this month the High Priest read the <a id="l156"></a>law of Moses to the people, &amp; for this end he studied it seven days to<a id="l157"></a>gether videlicet upon the 3<sup>d</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>t</sup>, 6<sup>t</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, &amp; 9<sup>th</sup>.   And in <a id="l158"></a>allusion to this practise the Lamb opens the seven seals of the book successively. <a id="l159"></a>And when he had opened the seventh seale there was silence for half an <a id="l160"></a>hour,   the people praying silently without  in the time of incense (Luke. 1. And an Angel <a id="l162"></a><br> representing the High Priest, came &amp; stood at the <a id="l168"></a>great Altar having a golden censer to take fire from thence. And there was <a id="l169"></a>given him much Incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints <a id="l170"></a>upon the golden Altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the <a id="l171"></a>incense with the prayers of the saints ascended upon before God out of the <a id="l172"></a>Angels hand, that is out of the censer in his hand while he  went into <a id="l173"></a>the most holy place  <a id="l174"></a>And the Angel took the censer &amp; filled it with fire of the Altar &amp; <a id="l175"></a>cast it upon the earth, that is on the ground without the sanctuary for <a id="l176"></a>burning of the  Bullock &amp; Goat for the sin offering. Levit 16. 12, 13, 27. And there were voices &amp; <a id="l177"></a>thundrings &amp; lightnings &amp; an earthquake; the voices &amp; thundrings alluding <a id="l178"></a>to the singing of the Levites at the sacrifice, &amp; the lightnings to the <a id="l179"></a>flame of the fire.</p>
<p id="par13">The day of Expiation was followed by the feast  of the seventh month which began on the 115<sup>th</sup> day of the month  o<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>f<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l180"></a>&amp; this Feast was kept seven days together with great sacrifices, at which <a id="l181"></a>the Priests sounded their Trumpets &amp; the Levites sang with loud voices <a id="l182"></a>&amp; played upon musicall instruments. And in allusion to this, seven Angels  sound their Trumpets &amp; seven thunders utter their <a id="l184"></a>voices at seven great warrs  considered <a id="l186"></a>as sacrifices.</p>
<p id="par14"> But it is to be observed that  the times between the opening of the seventh Seal &amp; the sounding <a id="l187"></a>of the seventh Trumpet are described four times  &amp; the descriptions begin with the words <em class="underline">And after these things</em>, that is after the visions of the sixt seal. First by the sealing <a id="l188"></a>of 144000 out of all the tribes of Israel &amp; by the palm bearing multitude <a id="l189"></a>appearing with palm branches in their hand; Secondly by the sounding of  six of the Trumpets; Thirdly by the  seven thunders uttering their <a id="l191"></a>voices &amp; by a declaration that when the seventh Angel should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished. &amp; fourthly by measuring the Temple &amp; Altar &amp; them that dwell <a id="l192"></a>therein &amp;   giving power to the two witnesses to prophesy till the <a id="l193"></a>sounding of the seventh Trumpet should sound.  The first begins with the words And after these thing<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> that is after the visions of the first six seals.  Iohn <a id="l195"></a>adds. And after these things I saw four Angels stand on the four corners of <a id="l196"></a>the Earth holding the four winds that they should not blow on the earth <a id="l197"></a>nor on the sea nor on any tree, that is, the   Angels of the first four Trumpets which preceded the wo-trumpets And the four Angels who were to <a id="l200"></a>sound those Trumpets were commanded that they should not hurt the earth <a id="l201"></a>&amp; the sea &amp; trees till the servants of God were sealed in their foreheads. This <a id="l202"></a>se<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>a<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ling therefore was performed when the  Angels of the Trumpets  <a id="l203"></a>upo<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>n the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> opening of the seventh seale appeared with their Trumpets &amp; <a id="l204"></a> ready to sound so soon as the servants of God  were sealed. This <a id="l205"></a>sealing of 144000 out of  the twelve Tribes of Israel &amp; leaving all <a id="l206"></a>the rest unsealed signifies the same thing with measuring the Temple <a id="l207"></a>&amp; Altar &amp; them that worship therein &amp; leaving out the court which is <a id="l208"></a>without the Temple. And therefore these two visions are contemporary <a id="l209"></a>to one another &amp; commence  at the same time with the opening of <a id="l210"></a>the seventh seale. </p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p003v"> &lt;3v&gt; </span>
<p id="par15">Now the measuring of the Temple &amp; Altar &amp; them that <a id="l211"></a>worship therein  &amp; leaving the outward Court unmeasured <a id="l212"></a>signifies the building of a new Temple without  a outward Court, &amp; <a id="l213"></a>therefore the times of the second Temple begins with the opening of <a id="l214"></a>the seventh seal. In this Temple were only two  Candlesticks supplied <a id="l215"></a>with oyle by two Olive trees, &amp; these are called the two witnesses. In the <a id="l216"></a>first Temple were seven golden candlesticks representing the seven <a id="l217"></a>Churches of Asia. Five of these in the Epistles to the seven Churches <a id="l218"></a>were found fault with &amp; exhorted to repent. These were laid aside <a id="l219"></a>&amp; only the other two which were blameless &amp; in a state of persecution <a id="l220"></a> affliction &amp; poverty were propagated down into the second Temple. </p>
<p id="par16">After these things the seventh Angel sounded &amp; the time of the <a id="l223"></a>dead came that they should be judged. And thus ended the prophesy of the <a id="l224"></a>seals &amp; Trumpets.  But as in Daniel every Vision <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>it<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>that<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>if<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> is followed with an <a id="l225"></a>interpretation: so here in Iohn all this Prophesy is repeated by way of inter<a id="l226"></a>pretation. And the Interpretation begins with these words And the Temple <a id="l227"></a>of God was opened in heaven &amp; there was seen in his Temple the Ark <a id="l228"></a>of his Testament. By the Ark you may know that this was the first Temple <a id="l229"></a>In this Temple appeared  a Woman cloathed with the sun representing the primitive Church &amp;  a great red <a id="l230"></a>Dragon representing the old Roman heathen Empire. And she brought forth <a id="l231"></a>a Man-child representing the first Christian Empire of the Romans  that was erected by the victorys <a id="l232"></a>of Constantine the great over Maxentius &amp; Maximinus [&amp; the Dragon <a id="l233"></a>or heathen Empire was cast out of heaven by the fall of Licinius, &amp; <a id="l234"></a>coming down among the common people] And at length a two-horned <a id="l235"></a>Beast rising out of the Earth or Greek Empire put an end to the <a id="l236"></a>times of the first Temple by causing them that dwell on the earth <a id="l237"></a>to make an image to the Beast which caused as many as would not <a id="l238"></a>worship it should be killed &amp; by causing all men to receive a mark in <a id="l239"></a>their right hand or in their forehead &amp; that no man might buy &amp; sell <a id="l240"></a>save he that had the mark or name of the Beast. And then  those who <a id="l241"></a> are excommunicated for not receiving <a id="l242"></a>the mark stand on mount Sion with Lamb to the number of 144000. <a id="l243"></a>Then follows  the preaching of the gospel to all nations spoken of in Matthew <a id="l244"></a>24.14. And then   the double fall of Babylon is proclaimed <a id="l245"></a>&amp; succeeded by the  harvest &amp; vintage at the end of the world.</p>
<p id="par17">Then the Prophet returns back to the time of opening the <a id="l246"></a>seventh seal, &amp; sees those that get the victory over the Beast &amp; his <a id="l247"></a>image &amp; mark stand on the sea of glass, that is, the 144000 who <a id="l248"></a>stood on Mount Sion with the Lamb &amp; who were sealed out of all <a id="l249"></a>the twelve tribes of Israel. These are they who  worshipped in <a id="l250"></a>the second Temple &amp; were measured there &amp; represented by the two <a id="l251"></a>candlesticks &amp; called the two witnesses. And while these stand on the <a id="l252"></a>sea of glass,  seven Angels pour out seven Vialls of wrath which <a id="l253"></a>are the drink offerings to the seven sacrifices at which the seven Trum<a id="l254"></a>pets sounded &amp; the seven thunders uttered their voices.</p>
<p id="par18">And then the Prophet returns back  to the time of the sixt <a id="l255"></a>seal when five of the heads were fallen &amp; the sixt was &amp; describes <a id="l256"></a>the reign of the Woman upon her Beast untill the double fall <a id="l257"></a>of Babylon, &amp;  then  goes on to the resurrection of the just  called <a id="l258"></a>the first resurrection &amp; represented before by the harvest, &amp; <a id="l259"></a>further unto the general resurrection represen<span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span>ted before by the <a id="l260"></a> vintage.</p>
