<p id="par2">––– with God &amp; at length was made flesh.</p>
<p id="par3">The Christians of the uncircumcision during the three first <a id="l1"></a>centuries &amp; part of the fourth generally held that Christ was in <a id="l2"></a>the beginning before all things &amp;  that God created all things <a id="l3"></a>by him &amp; said unto him Let us make man &amp; that he had do<a id="l4"></a>minion over all things &amp; appeared to Adam in paradise &amp; <a id="l5"></a>to [Cain &amp; Noah &amp;] the Patriarchs &amp; Moses &amp; Ioshuah &amp; at <a id="l6"></a>length came down from heaven, was incarnate &amp; born of the Virgin Mary without <a id="l7"></a>the help of a man &amp; became  a true man &amp; suffered &amp; rose again from the dead <a id="l8"></a>&amp; reascended into heaven where he was before. And the Christi<a id="l9"></a>ans of the circumcision were also of the very same opinion <a id="l10"></a>excepting some disputes about the incarnation. For Epipha<a id="l11"></a>nius<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> reciting the several opinions of the Ebionites tells us that some of them  said that <em class="underline">Christ <a id="l12"></a>was Adam, even that Adam who was first formed by God <a id="l13"></a>&amp; animated by the divine breath, &amp; that others of them <a id="l14"></a>said that Christ was from above &amp; that he was a spirit <a id="l15"></a>which was  created</em>  <em class="underline">before all things &amp; was above the Angels <a id="l16"></a>&amp; had dominion over  all things &amp; was called Christ, <a id="l17"></a>&amp; that his habitation or residence was there perpetually; <a id="l18"></a>but as often as he pleased, he descended to these lower regi<a id="l19"></a>ons, as when he came in Adam &amp; appeared to the patriarchs <a id="l20"></a>cloathed with a body, coming to Abraham &amp; to Isaac &amp; to <a id="l21"></a>Iacob; that this same Christ came in these last times &amp; cloathed <a id="l22"></a>himself with the body of Adam</em> [that is with flesh &amp; <a id="l23"></a>bones of the race of Adam] <em class="underline">&amp; appeared a man &amp; was cru<a id="l24"></a>cified &amp; rose again &amp; ascended. But these Ebionites again <a id="l25"></a>when they please say it was not thus, but that a spirit <a id="l26"></a>who is the Christ came into Iesus &amp; cloathed himself with <a id="l27"></a>him who is called Iesus.</em> Thus far Epiphanius. And a little <a id="l28"></a>after describing  more at large the third opinion of these <a id="l29"></a>Ebionites he represents that they said that <sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup><em class="underline">Iesus was born of the <a id="l30"></a>seed of man</em> [viz<sup>t</sup> of Ioseph &amp; Mary] <em class="underline">&amp; was chosen, &amp; by election was called the son <a id="l31"></a>of God from the Christ who came upon him from above in <a id="l32"></a>the form of a dove &amp; that they said not that this Christ was <a id="l33"></a>generated of God the father</em> [viz<sup>t</sup> in the naturall sense of the word that is by emission of  his fathers substance as a man is generated or as the heathens suppose <a id="l34"></a>their gods to be <a id="l35"></a>generated <em class="underline">but that he was created as one</em> <a id="l36"></a> <sup>of the Archangels</sup> [viz<sup>t</sup> in respect of his spiritual body] <em class="underline">&amp; was greater then they &amp; reigns over <a id="l37"></a>both the Angels &amp; all things which were made by the omni<a id="l38"></a>potent &amp; came &amp; taught what was in their Gospel</em>, that is, <a id="l39"></a>in the Gospel according to Matthew. What the Ebionites meant by the first of these three opinions I do not well <a id="l40"></a>understand, unless perhaps they meant that Christ was the <a id="l41"></a>Adam Cadmon or first Man of the Cabbalists, that is, their <a id="l42"></a>first Sephiroth or Æon called by them  Kether, the Crown <a id="l43"></a>or  supreme Sephiroth &amp; by the Gnosticks Ἀρχή <a id="l44"></a>the Beginning.   But whatever <a id="l45"></a>they meant, it is manifest that the Ebionites according to <a id="l46"></a>all the three opinions here ascribed to them taught that Christ <a id="l47"></a>was as old as the creation of the world, &amp; according to the <a id="l48"></a>second &amp; third opinion (&amp; perhaps also the first) that he was <a id="l49"></a>above the Angels &amp; Archangels &amp; reigned over them &amp; over all <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> things else from the beginning &amp; came down from heaven &amp; was <a id="l50"></a>either incarnate of the Virgin or descended upon Iesus. // And <a id="l51"></a>if the Ebionites made Christ as old as the creation &amp; took him <a id="l52"></a>to be the supreme being next under the father &amp; Lord of the <a id="l53"></a>Vniverse, much more did the Nazarenes. For the Naza<a id="l54"></a>renes generally called Christ the son of God, which those Ebionites <a id="l55"></a>who said that Iesus was the son of Ioseph, did not. Those Ebi<a id="l56"></a>onites said  only that Iesus was the son of God by election <a id="l57"></a>&amp; by the descent of Christ upon him, but they allowed not <a id="l58"></a>a generation of Christ as the Nazarenes did, nor did they <a id="l59"></a>say that Christ was born of a Virgin suffered on the cross &amp; rose again from the <a id="l60"></a>dead. These things they attributed only to Iesus the son of <a id="l61"></a>Ioseph &amp; Mary, &amp; therefore the Nazarenes who said <a id="l62"></a><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup>that Christ <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span> was the son of God &amp;  born of  a Virgin  &amp; suffered &amp; rose again &amp; <a id="l63"></a>ascended, were of the opinion that Christ came down from <a id="l64"></a>heaven &amp; took flesh of the Virgin by the power of God <a id="l65"></a>&amp; was born of her &amp; suffered &amp; rose again &amp; ascended where <a id="l66"></a>he was before, &amp; by reason of his supernatural incarnati<a id="l67"></a>on was called the son of God. And whereas  those Ebionites who were of this opinion said that he was ‡<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 1v &gt; </span>‡ created before all things, they meant not that he was produced out of <a id="l68"></a>nothing (for that was a later sense of the word:) but that he was <a id="l69"></a>formed with a spiritual body without the emission of his fathers <a id="l70"></a>substance. For God the father has not a bodily substance <a id="l71"></a>to emit, &amp; therefore in the litteral sense of the word, gene<a id="l72"></a>rates nothing with a body. Had they been asked whether Christ <a id="l73"></a>was the beginning of the creation of God &amp; <em class="underline">the first begotten of every creature</em>, that is, the first begotten <a id="l74"></a>of every thing produced without the emission of  the fathers sub<a id="l75"></a>stance, I question not but that they would have granted it: [&amp; therefore <a id="l76"></a>in calling him a creature intended not to deny him to be the [son of <a id="l77"></a>God in the sense of the Apostle] but neither they nor the Nazarenes <a id="l78"></a>had been taught to call him the son of God by a generation in a litteral sense before the world began. <a id="l79"></a></p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 2r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par4">Vpon the commencing of the Iewish war, the Christian <a id="l85"></a>Iews or Nazarenes fled from Ierusalem into other countries &amp; chiefly <a id="l86"></a>into Peræa on the eastern side of Iordan , &amp; there they <a id="l87"></a>began first to be called Ebionites. They were called Nazarenes  before by their enemies the unbeleiving <a id="l89"></a>Iews, &amp; in Peræa  they were first called Ebionites <a id="l90"></a>by their friends &amp; themselves: for they gloried in the <a id="l91"></a>name of Ebionites &amp; said that they knew of no such <a id="l92"></a>man as Ebion, but from the days of the Apostles had <a id="l93"></a>distributed their goods to the poor &amp; by that means <a id="l94"></a>being generally impoverished were called Ebionites <a id="l95"></a>from the word Ebion which in their language signifies <a id="l96"></a>a poor man.  This is the account which they gave of  themselves. <span class="ns"></span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 1v &gt; </span> <span class="ns"></span> And  according to this account the Ebionites were the Nazarenes of Peræa &amp; these Nazarenes were of several opinions.  Some said <a id="l97"></a>that Christ was Adam, but in what sense I do not find. Some that he was a spirit created <a id="l98"></a>before all things  &amp; had dominion over all things &amp; dwelt in heaven &amp; descended whenever <a id="l99"></a>he pleased &amp; conversed with the Patriarchs &amp; in the last days came down &amp; was incarnate <a id="l100"></a>&amp; appeared as a man &amp; was crucified &amp; rose again &amp; ascended. And this I take to be the <a id="l101"></a>  original &amp; most general opinion of the Nazarenes. And some said that this Christ who was before the  creation &amp; had dominion over all things only <a id="l102"></a>descended upon Iesus in the form of a dove &amp; dwelt in him &amp; did the supernatural works but was not <a id="l103"></a>really incarnate nor born nor died, but when Iesus was led to Pilate departed from him. And <a id="l104"></a>many of these Nazarenes being so zealous of the law as not only to observe it them<a id="l105"></a>selves but also to impose it upon the converted Gentiles as requisite to salvation <a id="l106"></a>they were at length distinguished from the rest of the Nazarenes by the name of <a id="l107"></a>Ebionites. This sect was therefore as old as the first Council of Ierusalem, tho the <a id="l108"></a>name was of a later date. And from all this . . .<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 2r resumes &gt; </span> But many among them being so zealous of the <a id="l109"></a>law as not only to observe it themselves but also to impose it <a id="l110"></a>on the converted Gentiles  as requisite to salvation, these were   censured for it  &amp; at length the name of Ebionites appropriated to them <a id="l117"></a>to distinguish them from the rest of the Nazarenes. This sect was therefore as <a id="l118"></a>old as the first Council of Ierusalem  tho the name was of a later date [&amp; the Nazarenes were  the first Christians.]. And from  all this it is <a id="l119"></a>manifest that the Christians of the Church of Ierusalem  beleived <a id="l120"></a>from the beginning that Christ was    before the creation <a id="l121"></a>&amp; had dominion over  the Angels &amp; Archangels &amp;  all things, <a id="l123"></a>&amp; at length came down from heaven &amp; either was incarnate <a id="l124"></a>or descended upon Iesus. And this faith spread from Ierusalem <a id="l125"></a>into all the earth,  &amp; continued to be the faith of all the Churches till the days of  Hegesippus Irenaeus &amp; Pope <a id="l127"></a>Eleutherus, the Christians generally beleiving that Christ was incarnate of the Virgin &amp; became <a id="l128"></a>man, &amp; some few that Christ <a id="l129"></a>descended upon Iesus, or in our language, that the divine nature <a id="l130"></a>descended upon the humane,  or God the Word upon the man Christ Iesus. </p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p002v"> &lt;2v&gt; </span>
<p id="par5">And this state of the primitive Church explains to us the true <a id="l132"></a>meaning of the beginning of the gospel of Iohn. <em class="underline">In the beginning was <a id="l133"></a>the Word &amp; the word was with God</em>.  <em class="underline">All things were made by <a id="l134"></a>him &amp; without him was nothing made that was made</em>. By these words <a id="l135"></a>Iohn confirms the opinion of the Nazarenes &amp; those Ebionites who <a id="l136"></a>said that Christ was in the beginning of the creation of the world, &amp; <a id="l137"></a>was then with God the father &amp; that God created all things by him. <a id="l138"></a><em class="underline">And the Word was God</em>,  not a mere power or vertue of the father emitted <a id="l139"></a>without a proper life will &amp; understanding  &amp; actuated by the fathers will as was <a id="l140"></a>the opinion of some  who said that Christ descended upon Iesus, but <a id="l141"></a>a person with a proper life understanding &amp; will, &amp; not any person <a id="l142"></a>but a divine person, a person with dominion, a person who had <a id="l143"></a>dominion over the Archangels &amp; Angels &amp; all things created. For <a id="l144"></a>this is the signification of Θεὸς. Ο῾ Θεὸς is an individual &amp; signifies <a id="l145"></a>the supreme God when limited to no other sense: Θεὸς is a species <a id="l146"></a>(as Origen &amp; Epiphanius tell us) &amp; may signify any divine Being with <a id="l147"></a>dominion. For <em class="underline">Elohim</em>, Θεὸς, <em class="underline">Deus</em>, <em class="underline">God</em> are words of dominion &amp; have the same significa<a id="l148"></a>tion with the word Lord but in a higher degree.  <em class="underline">And the word was made flesh</em>. <a id="l152"></a> This is said in opposition to those who taught that Christ descended <a id="l153"></a>upon Iesus in the form of a Dove &amp; dwelt in him &amp; did the works <a id="l154"></a>&amp; for confirming the opinion of those who said that he overshadowed <a id="l155"></a>the virgin &amp; was incarnate in the proper sense of the word &amp; <a id="l156"></a>became a true passible man.
