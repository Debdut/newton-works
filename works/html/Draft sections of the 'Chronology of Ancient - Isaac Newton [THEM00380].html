<p id="par2">And as the Egyptians, Phenicians &amp; Syrians in those days deified their own kings, so upon their coming into Asia minor &amp; Greece with Cadmus &amp; Sesostris they taught <a id="l53"></a>those nations to do the like. ⭗ For then it came there into <a id="l54"></a>fashion κτερίζειν, <em class="underline">parentare</em>, to celebrate the funerals of <a id="l55"></a>their dead fathers with festivals &amp; invocations &amp; sacrifices <a id="l56"></a>offered to their ghosts, &amp; to erect magnificent sepulchres <a id="l57"></a>in the form of temples with Altars &amp; Statues to persons of <a id="l58"></a>renown, &amp; there to honour them with sacrifices &amp; invocations. <a id="l59"></a>Every man might do it to his ancestors, &amp; the Greeks did it to all the eminent Greecians, as to Minos &amp; Rhadamanthus <a id="l60"></a>the nephews of Cadmus, to Ino his daughter &amp; Melicertes <a id="l61"></a>the son of Ino, to Bacchus the son of his daughter Semele <a id="l62"></a>Aristæus the husband of his daughter Autonoe, Iasion the brother <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> of his wife Harmonia, Hercules the son of Alcmena, Æsculapius <a id="l63"></a>the son of Apollo or Orus, Machaon the son of Æsculapius, &amp; Pa<a id="l64"></a>lemocrates the son of Machaon; to Pandion &amp; Theseus kings of <a id="l65"></a>Athens, Hippolytus the son of Theseus, Pan the son of Penelope <a id="l66"></a>Ceres, Proserpina Triptolemus, Celeus, Trophonius, Castor, Pollux, <a id="l67"></a>Helena Menelaus, Agamemnon, Amphiaraus, &amp; his son Am<a id="l68"></a>philochus. .

They deified <a id="l72"></a>their dead in divers manners according to their abilities <a id="l73"></a>&amp; circumstances &amp; the merits of the persons, some only <a id="l74"></a>in private families as houshold Gods or Dij penates, others <a id="l75"></a>by erecting gravestones to them in publick for annual <a id="l76"></a>sacrifices, others by building also to them sepulchres <a id="l77"></a>in the form of houses or Temples, &amp; some by appointing <a id="l78"></a>mysteries &amp; ceremonies &amp; set sacrifices &amp; festivals &amp; <a id="l79"></a>initiations &amp; a succession of Priests for observing &amp; per<a id="l80"></a>forming those institutions in the temples &amp; handing them <a id="l81"></a>down to posterity. Altars might begin to be erected in <a id="l82"></a>Europe a little before the days of Cadmus, but temples <a id="l83"></a>began a little after. <sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>For Æacus the son of Ægina who <a id="l85"></a>was two generations older then the Trojan war, was one of <a id="l86"></a>the first, some say the first, who built a temple in Greece. <a id="l87"></a>Oracles came from Ægypt into Greece about the same <a id="l88"></a>time, as did also the custome of forming the  <a id="l89"></a>images of the Gods with their leggs bound up in the <a id="l90"></a>shape of the Egyptian mummies. But idolatry began in <a id="l91"></a>Egypt &amp; Assyria &amp; spread thence into the neighbouring <a id="l92"></a>countries long before it came into Europe. For the coun<a id="l93"></a>tries upon the Tigris &amp; the Nile being exceeding fertile <a id="l94"></a>were first frequented by mankind &amp; grew first into king<a id="l95"></a>doms &amp; therefore first began to adore their kings. But <a id="l96"></a>these kingdoms were little ones in the beginning &amp; every <a id="l97"></a>kingdom worshipped only its own kings untill they con<a id="l98"></a>quered one another, &amp; at length Sesostris by conquest <a id="l99"></a>spread the worship of the Gods of Egypt into all his <a id="l100"></a>conquests &amp; made them more famous &amp; universal then <a id="l101"></a>the Gods of any other kingdom had been before, so as <a id="l102"></a>to be called <em class="underline">Dij magni majorum gentium</em>. For by the <a id="l103"></a>names of the cities of Egypt dedicated to many of these <a id="l104"></a>Gods &amp; by their hieroglyphical symbols, you may know <a id="l105"></a>that they were of an Egyptian original.</p>
<p id="par3">For in those days the writing of the Thebans &amp; <a id="l106"></a>Ethiopians was in hieroglyphicks. And this way of writing <a id="l107"></a>seems to have spread into the lower Egypt before the <a id="l108"></a>days of Moses. For thence came the worship of their <a id="l109"></a>Gods in the various shapes of birds beasts and fishes forbidden <a id="l110"></a>in the second commandment. Now this emblematical way <a id="l111"></a>of writing gave occasion to the Thebans &amp; Ethiopians who <a id="l112"></a>in the days of Samuel David Solomon &amp; Rehoboam conquered <a id="l113"></a>Ægypt &amp; the nations round about, &amp; erected a great Empire, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> to represent &amp; signify their conquering Kings &amp; Princes not by <a id="l114"></a>writing down their names but by making various hieroglyphical <a id="l115"></a>figures, as by painting Ammon with Rams horns to signify the <a id="l116"></a>King who conquered Libya a country abounding with sheep; his <a id="l117"></a>father Amosis with a sith to signify the king who conquered <a id="l118"></a>the lower Egypt a country abounding with corn; his son Osiris <a id="l119"></a>by an Ox because he taught the conquered nations to plow <a id="l120"></a>with oxen &amp; Bacchus with Bulls horns for the same reason, <a id="l121"></a>&amp; with grapes because he taught the nations to plant vines <a id="l122"></a>&amp; upon a Tyger because he subdued India; Orus the son <a id="l123"></a>of Osiris with a harp to signify the Prince who was emi<a id="l124"></a>nently skilled on that instrument; Iupiter upon an Eagle <a id="l125"></a>to signify the sublimity of his dominion &amp; with a thunder<a id="l126"></a>bolt to represent him a warrior; Venus in a Chariot drawn <a id="l127"></a>which two doves to represent her amorous &amp; lustfull; Neptune <a id="l128"></a>with a Trident to signify the commander of a fleet com<a id="l129"></a>posed of three squadrons; Thoth which a doggs head &amp; wings at <a id="l130"></a>his cap &amp; feet &amp; a caduceus writhen about which two serpents <a id="l131"></a>to signify a man of craft &amp; an Embassador who reconciled <a id="l132"></a>two contending nations; Pan with a pipe &amp; with the leggs <a id="l133"></a>of a Goat to signify a man delighted in piping &amp; dancing, <a id="l134"></a>&amp; Hercules with pillars &amp; a club because Sesostris set up <a id="l135"></a>pillars in all his conquests &amp; in the reign of his father <a id="l136"></a>Ammon fought against the Libyans with clubs.

But <a id="l304"></a>in the fift year of Asa the land of Iudah became quiet from <a id="l305"></a>war &amp; had quiet ten years, &amp; Asa took  away the Altars of <a id="l306"></a>strange gods &amp; brake down the images &amp; built the fenced <a id="l307"></a>cities of Iudah with walls &amp; towers &amp; gates &amp; barrs having <a id="l308"></a>rest on every side &amp; got up an army of 580000 men, with <a id="l309"></a>which in the 15<sup>th</sup> year of his reign he met Zerah the <a id="l310"></a>Ethiopian who came out against him with an army of a <a id="l311"></a>thousand thousand Ethiopians &amp; Libyans. The way of the <a id="l312"></a>Libyans was through Egypt &amp; therefore Zerah was now <a id="l313"></a>Lord of Egypt. They fought at Maresha neare Gerar <a id="l314"></a>between Egypt &amp; Iudea, &amp; &amp; Zerah was beaten so that he <a id="l315"></a>could not recover himself. And from all this I seem to gather <a id="l316"></a>that Osiris or Sesak was slain in the fift year of Asa &amp; <a id="l317"></a>thereupon Egypt fell into civil wars, being invaded by the <a id="l318"></a>Libyans &amp; defended by the Ethiopians for a time, &amp; afterwards <a id="l319"></a>becoming subject to the Ethiopians who slew Orus the son &amp; <a id="l320"></a>successor of Sesak, drowning him in the Nile, &amp; seized his kingdom. <a id="l321"></a>By these civil wars of Egypt the land of Iudah had rest ten <a id="l322"></a>years.

For <a id="l326"></a>Pliny <sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup> tells us: <em class="underline">Ægyptiorum bellis attrita est Æthiopia vicissim</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">imperitando serviendoque clara et potens, etiam usque ad <a id="l327"></a>Trojana bella Memnone regnante</em>. Æthiopia might reign <a id="l328"></a>over the upper part of Egypt as far as Thebes till <a id="l329"></a>Ammon or his father conquered it: for Homer places <a id="l330"></a>Thebes in Ethiopia.

<p id="par8">As Homer places Thebes in Ethiopia, so Herodotus tells <a id="l334"></a>us that Egypt was anciently the name of Thebais, meaning <a id="l335"></a>by Thebais the upper part of Egypt including Coptus; &amp; to <a id="l336"></a>this day the Egyptians call themselves Coptites. Whence its <a id="l337"></a>probable that Ethiopia &amp; Egypt were originally the names <a id="l338"></a>of two kingdoms under the dominion of Thebes &amp; Coptus <a id="l339"></a>the Hebrew word Ai or Greek word Αἰα which signifies a land being præfixed to denote the Land of Thebes &amp; <a id="l340"></a>the land of Coptus; &amp; that the names were afterwards <a id="l341"></a>extended by conquest, Ethiopia to all the people upon the <a id="l342"></a>Nile above Thebes &amp; Egypt to all the people upon the <a id="l343"></a>Nile below Syene. And so Mizraim might at first <a id="l344"></a>signify only the people on both sides the Nile next above <a id="l345"></a>the Delta subject to the  city Mesir &amp; afterwards be <a id="l346"></a>extended to all the lower Egypt peopled from thence by <a id="l347"></a>the invention of corn.</p>

<p id="par19">When Asa by his victory over Zerah became <a id="l480"></a>safe from Egypt, he assembled all the people &amp; they offered <a id="l481"></a>sacrifices out of the spoils &amp; entred into a covenant upon <a id="l482"></a>oath to seek the Lord, &amp; in lieu of the vessels taken away <a id="l483"></a>by Sesak he brought into the house of the Lord the things <a id="l484"></a>which he &amp; his father had dedicated the gold &amp; the silver <a id="l485"></a>&amp; the vessels, 2 Chron. <span class="smallcaps">xv</span>.</p>
<p id="par20">When Zerah was beaten so that he could not re<a id="l486"></a>cover himself, <sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup>the people of the lower Egypt revolted <a id="l489"></a>from the Ethiopians, called in to their assistance <a id="l490"></a>200000 Iews, &amp; under the conduct of one Asarsiphus <a id="l491"></a>caused the Ethiopians now under Memnon to retire <a id="l492"></a>to Memphys where he turned the river into a new <a id="l493"></a>channel, built a bridge over it &amp; fortified that pass <a id="l494"></a>&amp; then went back into Ethiopia. But after 13 years <a id="l495"></a>Memnon with his young son Ramesses came down with <a id="l496"></a>a great army from Ethiopia, conquered the lower Egypt <a id="l497"></a>&amp; drove out the Iews. And this action the Egyptian writers <a id="l498"></a>&amp; their followers call the second expulsion of the shepherds, <a id="l499"></a>taking Osarsiphus for Moses. Manetho saith that the <a id="l500"></a>shepherds kept Egypt 511 years. Count backwards those <a id="l501"></a>years from the expulsion of the Iews, &amp; the kingdom of <a id="l502"></a>the shepherds in Egypt will begin about 6 or 8 years after <a id="l503"></a>the expulsion of the Canaanites by Ioshua.</p>
<p id="par21">Tithonus a beautifull youth the elder brother of Priam went into Ethiopia <a id="l504"></a>being carried thither, I think, among many captives by Sesostris <a id="l505"></a>&amp; the Greeks before the days of Hesiod feigned that Memnon was <a id="l506"></a>his son. Memnon therfore in the opinion of those ancient Greeks <a id="l507"></a>was born after the return of Sesostris into Egypt. He is said <a id="l508"></a>to have lived very long, &amp; so might die about 90 or 100 years <a id="l509"></a>after Solomon, as we recconed above. <sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup>His mother in a statue <a id="l511"></a>erected to her in Egypt was represented the daughter the wife &amp; <a id="l512"></a>the mother of a king, &amp; therefore he was the son of a king:  <a id="l513"></a>which makes it probable that Zerah whom he succeeded in <a id="l514"></a>the kingdom might be his father, unless you had rather say that <a id="l515"></a>Zerah זרה should be ורה Orus.</p>
<p id="par22">Historians agree that Menes reigned in Egypt next <a id="l516"></a>after the Gods &amp; built Memphys &amp; the magnificent Temple <a id="l517"></a>of Vulcan. He built Memphys in the old channel of the Nile after he had turned the river.

Psam<a id="l520"></a>miticus who built the last Portico of this Temple reigned <a id="l521"></a>three hundred years after the victory of Asa over Zerah, &amp; it is not likely that this Temple could be above three hundred years in building, or that any Menes could be king of all <a id="l522"></a>Egypt before the expulsion of the Shepherds. The last of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> the Gods of Egypt was Orus with his mother Isis &amp; sister Bubaste <a id="l523"></a>&amp; secretary Thoth, &amp; Vnkle Typhon &amp; the king who reigned next after their <a id="l524"></a>deaths was Memnon or Amenophis called by the Egyptians <a id="l525"></a>Amenoph, &amp; therefore he is Menes. For the names Amenoph <a id="l526"></a>or Menoph &amp; Menes do not much differ. And from Amenoph <a id="l527"></a>the city Memphis said to be founded or built by Menes had <a id="l528"></a>its Egyptian names Moph, Noph Menoph or Menuf as it <a id="l529"></a>is still called by the Arabian historians. The fortifying of <a id="l530"></a>this place against Osarsiphus gave occasion to the building <a id="l531"></a>of it.</p>
<p id="par23">The kings of Egypt reigned first at Thebes &amp; then at Mem<a id="l532"></a>phis, &amp; Thebes was famous in Homers days having been the <a id="l533"></a>royal city of Ammon, Osiris &amp; Orus, but Memphys grew famous <a id="l534"></a>afterwards, &amp; therefore became not the seat of the kings <a id="l535"></a>of Egypt before the days of the Poet, nor were the Pyramids <a id="l536"></a>&amp; other famous works at Memphys then erected.

And upon his death Menes or <a id="l543"></a>Memnon might deify him &amp; found the famous Temple of <a id="l544"></a>Vulcan in that city for his worship, but not live to finish it. <a id="l545"></a><sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup>In a plane not far from Memphys are many small Pyramids  <a id="l546"></a>said to be built by <a id="l547"></a>Venephes or Enephes &amp; I suspect that Venephes has <a id="l548"></a>been corruptly written for Menephis or Amenophis. For after the <a id="l549"></a>example of these Pyramids the following kings Mœris &amp; his successors built others much <a id="l550"></a>larger. The place in which they were built was the burying <a id="l551"></a>place of that city as appears by the Mummies there found <a id="l552"></a>&amp; therefore the Pyramids were the sepulchral monuments <a id="l553"></a>of the Kings &amp; Princes of that city. And the city by these &amp; such like <a id="l554"></a>works grew famous after the days of Homer &amp; Hesiod.</p>
<p id="par24">Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> the oldest historian (next after Solon) who <a id="l555"></a>wrote of the Egyptian antiquities &amp; had what he wrote from <a id="l556"></a>the Priests of Egypt, tells us that those Priests recited out of <a id="l557"></a>their books the names of 330 kings who reigned after Menes <a id="l558"></a>but did nothing memorable except Nitocris &amp; Mœris the last of them. After Mœris he reccons Sesostris <a id="l559"></a>Pheron, Protius, Rhampsinitus, Cheops, Cephren, Mycerinus, <a id="l560"></a>Asychis, Amysis, Sabacus &amp;c. The Egyptians before the <a id="l561"></a>days of Solon had made their antiquities 9000 year older <a id="l562"></a>then the truth &amp; here to make it out, they reccon <a id="l563"></a>to Herodotus a succession of 330 Kings reigning so many generations that is 11000 years before Sesostris. But before the <a id="l564"></a>use of letters they knew not how to write down the <a id="l565"></a>names of their kings. They could only represent them <a id="l566"></a>by symbols &amp; write down the histories of the men represented <a id="l567"></a>by those symbols: &amp; therefore we may with Herodotus omit <a id="l568"></a>‡ the names of those kings who did nothing memorable. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 9v &gt; </span>‡ the names of those kings who did nothing memorable &amp; consider only those whose <a id="l569"></a>actions are recorded. For those reduced into  due order will give us  allmost all the kings of Egypt from the days of Ammon &amp; Sesostris downwards to the reign of Sabacus.  <a id="l571"></a>And their names corrupted will give us many others recited in the uncertain dynasties of Manetho &amp; Eratosthenes. Sesostris reigned in the age of the Gods of Egypt being the Bacchus &amp; Osiris of <a id="l572"></a>the ancients &amp; therefore Menes Nitocris &amp; Mœris are to be placed after him <a id="l573"></a>Pheron is by Herodotus called the son &amp; successor of Sesostris &amp; so seems to <a id="l574"></a>be the same king with Orus, called Pharaoh or Pheron after his fa<a id="l575"></a>thers death. Pliny calls him Nuncoreus.  <a id="l577"></a>Proteus reigned  in the lower Egypt when  Paris sailed thither with <a id="l578"></a>Helenes, that is, 20 years before the taking of Troy, &amp; so might be <a id="l579"></a>Osarsiphus. The name Proteus signifies a Prince &amp; Herodotus tells us <a id="l580"></a>that it was the kings name translated into Greek &amp; that he rose up from among the common people. Conon calls him an <a id="l581"></a>Egyptian Prophet, that is, a Priest; &amp; Iosephus tells us that Osarsiphus <a id="l582"></a>was Priest of Heliopolis. Amenophis  began to reigne before  the revolt of Osarsiphus &amp; conquered him &amp; then  became king of all <a id="l584"></a>Egypt;  &amp; since he reigned next after the Gods, he is Menes, as above.</p> 
<p id="par25">After Menes had built Memphis &amp; the Temple of Vulcan, he <a id="l585"></a>was succeeded by his son called by Herodotus Rhampsinitus &amp; by others <a id="l586"></a>Ramses, Rameses, Ramesses, Remphis, Rhampses. This king built the western <a id="l587"></a>Portico of the Temple of Vulcan &amp; Mœris built the northern Portico <a id="l588"></a>thereof more stately &amp; therefore reigned after both. He also  made the Lake <a id="l589"></a>of Mœris with two great Pyramids of brick in the midst of it &amp; the Labyrinth. And <a id="l590"></a>for præserving the division of Egypt into equal shares amongst the soldiers <a id="l591"></a>this king wrote a  book of surveying, which gave a beginning to Geometry <a id="l592"></a>He is called also Maris, Myris,  Marrus, &amp; corruptly by changing <a id="l593"></a>M into A, VI, <span class="greek">Σ</span>, YX, <span class="greek">Α</span> &amp; such like mistakes) Ayres, Biyres, Soris, Vchoreus, <a id="l594"></a>Lacharis, Labaris, Thoris,  &amp;c.</p>
<p id="par26">Diodorus places Vchoreus Between Osimanduas &amp; Miris ( i.e. Memnon &amp; Mœris) , &amp; says that he built Memphys &amp; fortified it to <a id="l596"></a>admiration with a mighty rampart of earth &amp; a broad &amp; deep <a id="l597"></a>trench which was filled with the water of the Nile, &amp; built pala<a id="l598"></a>ces in it; &amp; that this place was so commodiously seated that most <a id="l599"></a>of the kings who reigned after him preferred it before Thebes &amp; <a id="l600"></a> removed the Court thence to this place, so that the magnificence <a id="l601"></a>of Thebes from that time began to decrease &amp; that of Memphys <a id="l602"></a>to increase till Alexander king of Macedon built Alexandria. <a id="l603"></a>These great works of Vchoreus, &amp; those of Mœris savour of <a id="l604"></a>one &amp; the same genius, &amp; I take them to have been done by one <a id="l605"></a>&amp; the same king  distinguished into two by a corruption of the name.</p> 
<p id="par27">After the example of the two brick Pyramids made by <a id="l606"></a>Mœris, the next kings Cheops, Cephren &amp; Mycerinus built the <a id="l607"></a>three great Pyramids of marble</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 10r resumes &gt; </span>
