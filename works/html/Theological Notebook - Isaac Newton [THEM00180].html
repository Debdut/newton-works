Then Abimelech called Abraham &amp; said – what have I offended thee that thou hast brought on me &amp; on my kingdom a great sin? – And Abraham said because I thought surely the fear of God is not in this place, &amp; they will slay me for my wives sake.  And Abimelech gave gifts to Abraham &amp; restored Sarah – And God healed Abimelech &amp; his wife &amp; maid-servants &amp; they bare children: ffor he had closed up all their wombs becaus of Sarah.

<p id="par42">And Israel abode in Shittim, &amp; the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab. And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their Gods &amp; the people did eat &amp; bowed down to their Gods. And Israel joyned himself unto Baal-Peor. Numb 25.1, 2, 3.

<p id="par45">The Ephod which Gideon made &amp; placed in his city Ophrah Iudges 8.27. was doubtless intended for the worship of the true God in imitation of the high Priests Ephod. ffor Gideon had lately seen an Angel of God, &amp; was commanded by God himself to destroy the worship of Baal &amp; did accordingly, Iudges 6. Insomuch that the Israelites turned not again to go a whoring after the heathen gods &amp; to forget the Lord till after Gideons death. ffor it is said that as soon as Gideon was dead the children of Israel turned again &amp; went a whoring after Baalim &amp; made Baal-Berith their God, &amp; —  remembered not the Lord their God  — neither shewed kindness to the house of Gideon. Iudges 8.33, 34, 35. And yet of the Ephod it is said  in Gideons life time that all Israel went  thither (to Ophrah) a <em class="underline">whoring</em> after it, &amp; that it became a snare unto Gideon &amp; to his house.

<p id="par46">Micah his Idolatry related Iudges 17 was in worshipping Images with respect to the true God. ffor of the silver of which the Images were made his Mother said that she had wholly dedicated it unto the <em class="underline">Lord</em> from her hand for her son to make a graven Image &amp; a molten Image vers  3. And doubtless it was in imitation of the true worship at Shiloh that he also made an Ephod &amp; Teraphim &amp; consecrated one of his sons who became his Priest; vers 5. And in further imitation of it that afterward he procured a Levite to be his Priest, saying Now I know that the <em class="underline">Lord</em> will do me good seing I have a Levite for my Priest, Vers 12, 13. And further the Danites when they  coming to Micahs house met with the Levite &amp; knew him to be 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> his Priest, said, Ask counsel we pray thee of <em class="underline">God</em>: chap 18. vers 5.

So that doubtles<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the worship of the true God was intended in these Images. And yet it was Idolatry ffor the Images are termed Micahs Gods in ch 17 v 5 where tis said that Micah had a house of Gods; &amp; in ch 18 v 24 where Micah saith to the Danites, Ye have taken away my Gods which I made. And the story is related with this character That in those days there was no King in Israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes c 17. v 6.</p>
<p id="par47">And so it is not to be doubted that the Danites were Idolaters in setting up Micah's graven Image, which they took from him, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh. Iudges 18.31. And yet it is most reasonable to think that they worshiped the Images with respect to the true God, becaus they acknowledged the true God in them Chap 18 v 5. &amp; had Micah's Priest to instruct them in his way of worship. ch. 18.30.</p>
<p id="par48">It is not probable that Solomon to whome God appeared twice 1 Kings 11.9 &amp; who was the wisest of men &amp; understood the nature of all trees, beasts, foules, creeping things &amp; fishes 1 Kings 4.33 could be so little a Philosopher as to think that Images made of Gold or wood or Stone were Deities. We may rather suppose that  he fell into Idolatry, through a perswasion that there was some reality in the supposed Gods Chemosh, Molech, Asterosh &amp;c to which the Heathen Idols were dedicated. &amp; so worshipped their Idols with respect to them. ffor if we consider that in the books of Moses &amp; the Iudges there is frequent mention of Angels imployed on severall occasions to execute the will of God in the government of the world why might not his heathen wives &amp; concubines by telling him stories of the works &amp; power of their Gods, perswade him to think that the supreme God had committed the government of the world to Angels &amp; such like intermediate beings &amp; that of this sort were the Heathen Deities &amp; therfore might be supplicated for their assistance &amp; worshipped as the superintendents of mankind. And thus notwithstanding his wisdom he might be perswaded to go a whoring after them, as he did 1 Kings 11.7, 33.</p>

<p id="par63">Look not every man on his own things but also every man on the things of others. Let this mind be in you which was also in christ Iesus: Who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equall with God. But made him self of no reputation (&amp; took upon him the form of a servant &amp; was made in the likeness of men, (ὃς ἐν μορφη θεου υπάρχων, οὐχ᾽ ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγήσατο τὸ εἰναι ἰσα θεω ἀλλ᾽ ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσε μορφὴν δούλου λαβων, εν ὁμοιώματι ανθρωπων γενόμενος καὶ σχήματι ἑυρεθεὶς ὡς ανθρωπος &amp;c) and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself &amp; became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him &amp; given him a name which is above every name; That at the name of Iesus every knee should bow, &amp; that every tongue should confess that Iesus Christ is lord to the glory of God the Father. Phil: 2.</p>
<p id="par64">– Who is the Image of the invisible God, the first born of every creature. For by him [God the Father] were all things created that are in heaven &amp; that are in earth visible &amp; invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities or powers, all things were created by him &amp; for him. And he is before all things &amp; by him all things <em class="underline">consist</em>. And he [Christ] is the head of the body the church, who is the beginning, the first born from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell Colos 1.15. – In him are hid all the treasures of wisdome &amp; knowledg, – For in him dwelleth all the fulnes of the Godhead bodily.

<p id="par66">God who at sundry times &amp; in divers manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the Prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory &amp; the express image of his person and <em class="underline">upholding</em> all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins sate down on the right hand of the majesty on high: being made so much better than the Angels as he hath  by inheritance obteined a more excellent name then they. For unto which of the Angels said he at any time thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee —— But unto the son he saith; Thy throne, O God,<sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup>  is for ever &amp; ever; a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousnes &amp; hated iniquity, therefore *<sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup>  God, even <em class="underline">thy God</em>, hath annoynted thee with the oyle of gladness above thy fellows.

<p id="par77">That which was from the beginning which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon &amp; our hands handled of the word of life: (For the life was manifested &amp; we have seen it, &amp; bear witness, &amp; shew unto you that eternall life which was with the Father &amp; was manifested unto us) that which we have seen &amp; heard declare we unto you &amp;c 1 Iohn 1.1.</p>

<p id="par82">No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man which is in heaven. Iohn 3.13.</p>
<p id="par83">God so loved the world that he gave his onely begotten son. Iohn 3.16.</p>
<p id="par84">He must increas but I must decreas. He that cometh from above is above all, he that is of the earth is earthly &amp; speaketh of the earth, he that cometh from the heaven is above all – – He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God, for God giveth not the spirit by measure unto him. The father loveth the son &amp; hath given all things into his hand. Iohn 3.30.</p>
<p id="par85">Iesus answered, my Father worketh hitherto, &amp; I work. Therefore the Iews sought the more to kill him becaus – he said that God was his Father, making himself equall with God. Then answered Iesus – the son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for whatsoever he doth these also doth the son likewise. For the Father loveth the son &amp; sheweth him all things that himself doth, &amp; he will shew him greater works then these that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiseth up the dead &amp; quickneth them even so the son quickneth whom he will.

For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the son to have life in himself, &amp; hath given him autority to execute judgment also — I can of my self do nothing; As I hear I judg, &amp; my judgment is just becaus I seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me. Iohn 5.17.</p>
<p id="par86">I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me. – No man hath seen the Father save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father – As the living Father hath sent me &amp; I live by the Father, so he that eateth me even he shall live by me – Doth this trouble you, what &amp; if ye shall se the son of man ascend up where he was before.

<p id="par88">Therefore doth my Father love me becaus I lay down my life that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me but I lay it down of my self. I have power to lay it down &amp; I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father Iohn 10.17</p>
<p id="par89">My sheep hear my voice &amp; I know them &amp; they follow me, &amp; I give unto them eternall life, &amp; they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My father which gave me them is greater then all, &amp; no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand. I &amp; the Father are one. Then the Iews took up stones – &amp; said – For a good work we stone the not but for blasphemy &amp; becaus thou being a man makest thy self God. Iesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said ye are Gods. If he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came, &amp; the scripture canot be broken: say ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified &amp; sent into the world; Thou blasphemest: becaus I said I am the Son of God?

And for this cause he is the mediator of the new Testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promis of the eternall inheritance. For where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament – is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. Whereupon neither was the first testament dedicated without blood. For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017v"> &lt;17v&gt; </span> calves &amp; of Goates with water &amp; scarlet wool &amp; hysop &amp; sprinkled both the book &amp; all the people, saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath injoyned unto you. Moreover he sprinkled likewise with blood both the Tabernacle &amp; all the vessels of the ministry. And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; &amp; without shedding of blood is no remission It was therefore necessary that the pattern of things for the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices then these. &amp;c.

But God comendeth his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us. Much more being now justifyed by his blood we shall be saved from  wrath  through him. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life.

For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection from the dead. For as in Adam all dye so in Christ shall all be made alive.

<p id="par201">It seemed good to the Holy ghost &amp; to us to lay upon you no greater burthen then these necessary things, That ye abstain from meats offered to Idols &amp;c. Acts 15.28.</p>
<p id="par202">While Appollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus, &amp; finding certain disciples, he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since ye beleived. And they said unto him, we have not so much as heard whither there be any holy ghost. And he said unto them unto (or into) what then were ye baptised? And they said. Vnto Iohns baptism. Then said Paul. Iohn verily baptised with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should beleive on him that should come after him that is on Christ Iesus. When they heard this they were baptised in or into the name of the Lord Iesus (id est into the faith &amp; profession of his name) And when Paul had laid his hands on them the holy ghost came on them, &amp; they spake with tongues &amp; prophesied. And all the men were about twelve. Acts 19.1. Hence Iohn baptised not in the name of the holy ghost but the Aposles always did.</p>

<p id="par207">No man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Iesus accursed, &amp; no man can say that Iesus is the Lord but by the holy ghost.

But the Manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withall. For to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledg by the same spirit. To another the working of miracles, to another Prophesy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these worketh that <em class="underline">one &amp; the self same</em> spirit, dividing to every severally as he <em class="underline">will</em>.

<p id="par272">Vnto which of the Angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand untill I make thine enemies thy foot stool, Are they not all ministring spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation. Hebr 1.13.</p>

<p id="par275">All things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the Image of his son, that he might be the first born among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them also he called; &amp; whom he called them he also justified: &amp; whom he justified them he also glorified. Rom. 8.28.</p>
<p id="par276">The children not being yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth, it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger. As it is written Iacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whome I will have mercy, &amp; I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. For the scripture saith unto Pharoh Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might shew my power in thee, &amp; that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, &amp; whom he will he hardneth. Thou wilt say then unto me; Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? Nay but O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour &amp; another unto dishonour? What if God willing to shew his wrath &amp; to make his power known, endured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath filled to destruction? And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory; even us whom he hath called not of the Iews onely but also of the Gentiles. Rom 9.11.</p>
<p id="par277">Blessed be the God &amp; Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spirituall blessings in heavenly places in christ; according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy &amp; without blame before him in love: having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Iesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will – In Christ we have obteined an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will. Ephes 1.3, 11.</p>
<p id="par278">Vnto me is this grace given – that I should – make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Iesus Christ: To the intent that now unto the Principalities &amp; powers in heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Iesus our Lord. Eph 3.9.</p>
<p id="par279">When it pleased God who separated me from my Mothers womb &amp; called me by his grace to reveale his son in me that I might preach him among the heathen, immediately I conferred not with flesh &amp; blood, neither went I up to Ierusalem &amp;c Gal 1.15.</p>
