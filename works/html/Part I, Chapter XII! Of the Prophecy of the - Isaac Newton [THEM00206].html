<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">CHAP. XII.</h2>
<p id="par1" class="cent"><em>Of the Prophecy of the Scripture of Truth.</em></p>
<p id="par2">The kingdoms represented by the second and third Beasts, or the Bear and Leopard, are again described by <em>Daniel</em> in his last Prophecy written in the third year of <em>Cyrus</em> over <em>Babylon</em>, the year in which he conquered <em>Persia</em>. For this Prophecy is a commentary upon the Vision of the Ram and He-Goat.</p>
<p id="par3"><em>Behold</em>, saith he,<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> <em>there shall stand up yet three kings in </em>Persia, [<em>Cyrus</em>, <em>Cambyses</em>, and <em>Darius Hystaspes</em>] <em>and the fourth</em> [<em>Xerxes</em>] <em>shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength thro' his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of </em>Grecia<em>. And a mighty king</em> [<em>Alexander</em> the great] <em>shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided towards the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity</em> [but after their death,] <em>nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p170"> &lt;170&gt; </span> <em>his kingdom shall be pluckt up, even for others besides those</em>. <em>Alexander</em> the great having conquered all the <em>Persian</em> Empire, and some part of <em>India</em>, died at <em>Babylon</em> a month before the summer Solstice, in the year of <em>Nabonassar</em> 425: and his captains gave the monarchy to his bastard brother <em>Philip Aridæus</em>, a man disturbed in his understanding; and made <em>Perdiccas</em> administrator of the kingdom. <em>Perdiccas</em> with their consent made <em>Meleager</em> commander of the army, <em>Seleucus</em> master of the horse, <em>Craterus</em> treasurer of the kingdom, <em>Antipater</em> governor of <em>Macedon</em> and <em>Greece</em>, <em>Ptolemy</em> governor of <em>Egypt</em>; <em>Antigonus</em> governor of <em>Pamphylia</em>, <em>Lycia</em>, <em>Lycaonia</em>, and <em>Phrygia major</em>; <em>Lysimachus</em> governor of <em>Thrace</em>, and other captains governors of other Provinces; as many as had been so before in the days of <em>Alexander</em> the great. The <em>Babylonians</em> began now to count by a new <em>Æra</em>, which they called the <em>Æra</em> of <em>Philip</em>, using the years of <em>Nabonassar</em>, and reckoning the 425th year of <em>Nabonassar</em> to be the first year of <em>Philip</em>. <em>Roxana</em> the wife of <em>Alexander</em> being left big with child, and about three or four months after brought to bed of a son, they called him <em>Alexander</em>, saluted him King, and joined him with <em>Philip</em>, whom they had before placed in the throne. <em>Philip</em> reigned three years under the administratorship of <em>Perdiccas</em>, two years more under <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p171"> &lt;171&gt; </span> the administratorship of <em>Antipater</em>, and above a year more under that of <em>Polyperchon</em>; in all six years and four months; and then was slain with his Queen <em>Eurydice</em> in <em>September</em> by the command of <em>Olympias</em> the mother of <em>Alexander</em> the great. The <em>Greeks</em> being disgusted at the cruelties of <em>Olympias</em>, revolted to <em>Cassander</em> the son and successor of <em>Antipater</em>. <em>Cassander</em> affecting the dominion of <em>Greece</em>, slew <em>Olympias</em>; and soon after shut up the young king <em>Alexander</em>, with his mother <em>Roxana</em>, in the castle of <em>Amphipolis</em>, under the charge of <em>Glaucias</em>, <em>An. Nabonass.</em> 432. The next year <em>Ptolemy</em>, <em>Cassander</em> and <em>Lysimachus</em>, by means of <em>Seleucus</em>, form'd a league against <em>Antigonus</em>; and after certain wars made peace with him, <em>An. Nabonass.</em> 438, upon these conditions: that <em>Cassander</em> should command the forces of <em>Europe</em> till <em>Alexander</em> the son of <em>Roxana</em> came to age; and that <em>Lysimachus</em> should govern <em>Thrace</em>, <em>Ptolemy</em> <em>Egypt</em> and <em>Lybia</em>, and <em>Antigonus</em> all <em>Asia</em>. <em>Seleucus</em> had possest himself of <em>Mesopotamia</em>, <em>Babylonia</em>, <em>Susiana</em> and <em>Media</em>, the year before. About three years after <em>Alexander</em>'s death he was made governor of <em>Babylon</em> by <em>Antipater</em>; then was expelled by <em>Antigonus</em>; but now he recovered and enlarged his government over a great part of the <em>East</em>: which gave occasion to a new <em>Æra</em>, called <em>Æra Seleuci<a id="l1"></a></em><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p172"> &lt;172&gt; </span><em>darum</em>. Not long after the peace made with <em>Antigonus</em>, <em>Diodorus</em> saith the same <em>Olympic</em> year; <em>Cassander</em>, seeing that <em>Alexander</em> the son of <em>Roxana</em> grew up, and that it was discoursed thro'out <em>Macedonia</em> that it was fit he should be set at liberty, and take upon him the government of his father's kingdom, commanded <em>Glaucias</em> the governor of the castle to kill <em>Roxana</em> and the young king <em>Alexander</em> her son, and conceal their deaths. Then <em>Polyperchon</em> set up <em>Hercules</em>, the son of <em>Alexander</em> the great by <em>Barsinè</em>, to be king; and soon after, at the sollicitation of <em>Cassander</em>, caused him to be slain. Soon after that, upon a great victory at sea got by <em>Demetrius</em> the son of <em>Antigonus</em> over <em>Ptolemy</em>, <em>Antigonus</em> took upon himself the title of king, and gave the same title to his son. This was <em>An. Nabonass.</em> 441. After his example, <em>Seleucus</em>, <em>Cassander</em>, <em>Lysimachus</em> and <em>Ptolemy</em>, took upon themselves the title and dignity of kings, having abstained from this honour while there remained any of <em>Alexander</em>'s race to inherit the crown. Thus the monarchy of the <em>Greeks</em> for want of an heir was broken into several kingdoms; four of which, seated <em>to the four winds of heaven</em>, were very eminent. For <em>Ptolemy</em> reigned over <em>Egypt</em>, <em>Lybia</em> and <em>Ethiopia</em>; <em>Antigonus</em> over <em>Syria</em> and the lesser <em>Asia</em>; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p173"> &lt;173&gt; </span> <em>Lysimachus</em> over <em>Thrace</em>; and <em>Cassander</em> over <em>Macedon</em>, <em>Greece</em> and <em>Epirus</em>, as above.</p>
<p id="par4"><em>Seleucus</em> at this time reigned over the nations which were beyond <em>Euphrates</em>, and belonged to the bodies of the two first Beasts; but after six years he conquered <em>Antigonus</em>, and thereby became possest of one of the four kingdoms. For <em>Cassander</em> being afraid of the power of <em>Antigonus</em>, combined with <em>Lysimachus</em>, <em>Ptolemy</em> and <em>Seleucus</em>, against him: and while <em>Lysimachus</em> invaded the parts of <em>Asia</em> next the <em>Hellespont</em>, <em>Ptolemy</em> subdued <em>Phœnicia</em> and <em>Cœlosyria</em>, with the sea-coasts of <em>Asia</em>.</p>
<p id="par5"><em>Seleucus</em> came down with a powerful army into <em>Cappadocia</em>, and joining the confederate forces, fought <em>Antigonus</em> in <em>Phrygia</em> and slew him, and seized his kingdom, <em>An. Nabonass.</em> 447. After which <em>Seleucus</em> built <em>Antioch</em>, <em>Seleucia</em>, <em>Laodicea</em>, <em>Apamea</em>, <em>Berrhæa</em>, <em>Edessa</em>, and other cities in <em>Syria</em> and <em>Asia</em>; and in them granted the <em>Jews</em> equal privileges with the <em>Greeks</em>.</p>
<p id="par6"><em>Demetrius</em> the son of <em>Antigonus</em> retained but a small part of his father's dominions, and at length lost <em>Cyprus</em> to <em>Ptolemy</em>; but afterwards killing <em>Alexander</em>, the son and successor of <em>Cassander</em> king of <em>Macedon</em>, he seized his kingdom, <em>An. Nabonass.</em> 454. Sometime after, preparing a very great army to recover his father's dominions in <em>Asia</em>; <em>Seleucus</em>, <em>Ptolemy</em>, <em>Lysimachus</em> and <em>Pyr<a id="l2"></a></em><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p174"> &lt;174&gt; </span><em>rhus</em> king of <em>Epirus</em>, combined against him; and <em>Pyrrhus</em> invading <em>Macedon</em>, corrupted the army of <em>Demetrius</em>, put him to flight, seized his kingdom, and shared it with <em>Lysimachus</em>. After seven months, <em>Lysimachus</em> beating <em>Pyrrhus</em>, took <em>Macedon</em> from him, and held it five years and a half, uniting the kingdoms of <em>Macedon</em> and <em>Thrace</em>. <em>Lysimachus</em> in his wars with <em>Antigonus</em> and <em>Demetrius</em>, had taken from them <em>Caria</em>, <em>Lydia</em>, and <em>Phrygia</em>; and had a treasury in <em>Pergamus</em>, a castle on the top of a conical hill in <em>Phrygia</em>, by the river <em>Caicus</em>, the custody of which he had committed to one <em>Philetærus</em>, who was at first faithful to him, but in the last year of his reign revolted. For <em>Lysimachus</em>, having at the instigation of his wife <em>Arsinoe</em>, slain first his own son <em>Agathocles</em>, and then several that lamented him; the wife of <em>Agathocles</em> fled with her children and brothers, and some others of their friends, and sollicited <em>Seleucus</em> to make war upon <em>Lysimachus</em>; whereupon <em>Philetærus</em> also, who grieved at the death of <em>Agathocles</em>, and was accused thereof by <em>Arsinoe</em>, took up arms, and sided with <em>Seleucus</em>. On this occasion <em>Seleucus</em> and <em>Lysimachus</em> met and fought in <em>Phrygia</em>; and <em>Lysimachus</em> being slain in the battel, lost his kingdom to <em>Seleucus</em>, <em>An. Nabonass.</em> 465. Thus the Empire of the <em>Greeks</em>, which at first brake into four king<a id="l3"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p175"> &lt;175&gt; </span>doms, became now reduced into two notable ones, henceforward called by <em>Daniel</em> the kings of the <em>South</em> and <em>North</em>. For <em>Ptolemy</em> now reigned over <em>Egypt</em>, <em>Lybia</em>, <em>Ethiopia</em>, <em>Arabia</em>, <em>Phœnicia</em>, <em>Cœlosyria</em>, and <em>Cyprus</em>; and <em>Seleucus</em>, having united three of the four kingdoms, had a dominion scarce inferior to that of the <em>Persian</em> Empire, conquered by <em>Alexander</em> the great. All which is thus represented by <em>Daniel</em>:<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> <em>And the king of the</em> South [<em>Ptolemy</em>] <em>shall be strong, and one of his Princes</em> [<em>Seleucus</em>, one of <em>Alexander</em>'s Princes] <em>shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion</em>.</p>
<p id="par7">After <em>Seleucus</em> had reigned seven months over <em>Macedon</em>, <em>Greece</em>, <em>Thrace</em>, <em>Asia</em>, <em>Syria</em>, <em>Babylonia</em>, <em>Media</em>, and all the <em>East</em> as far as <em>India</em>; <em>Ptolemy Ceraunus</em>, the younger brother of <em>Ptolemy Philadelphus</em> king of <em>Egypt</em>, slew him treacherously, and seized his dominions in <em>Europe</em>: while <em>Antiochus Soter</em>, the son of <em>Seleucus</em>, succeeded his father in <em>Asia</em>, <em>Syria</em>, and most of the <em>East</em>; and after nineteen or twenty years was succeeded by his son <em>Antiochus Theos</em>; who having a lasting war with <em>Ptolemy Philadelphus</em>, at length composed the same by marrying <em>Berenice</em> the daughter of <em>Philadelphus</em>: but after a reign of fifteen years, his first wife <em>Laodice</em> poisoned him, and set her son <em>Seleu</em><a id="l4"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p176"> &lt;176&gt; </span><em>cus Callinicus</em> upon the throne. <em>Callinicus</em> in the beginning of his reign, by the impulse of his mother <em>Laodice</em>, besieged <em>Berenice</em> in <em>Daphne</em> near <em>Antioch</em>, and slew her with her young son and many of her women. Whereupon <em>Ptolemy Euergetes</em>, the son and successor of <em>Philadelphus</em>, made war upon <em>Callinicus</em>; took from him <em>Phœnicia</em>, <em>Syria</em>, <em>Cilicia</em>, <em>Mesopotamia</em>, <em>Babylonia</em>, <em>Susiana</em>, and some other regions; and carried back into <em>Egypt</em> 40000 talents of silver, and 2500 images of the Gods, amongst which were the Gods of <em>Egypt</em> carried away by <em>Cambyses</em>. <em>Antiochus Hierax</em> at first assisted his brother <em>Callinicus</em>, but afterwards contended with him for <em>Asia</em>. In the mean time <em>Eumenes</em> governor of <em>Pergamus</em> beat <em>Antiochus</em>, and took from them both all <em>Asia</em> westward of mount <em>Taurus</em>. This was in the fifth year of <em>Callinicus</em>, who after an inglorious reign of 20 years was succeeded by his son <em>Seleucus Ceraunus</em>; and <em>Euergetes</em> after four years more, <em>An. Nabonass.</em> 527, was succeeded by his son <em>Ptolemy Philopator</em>. All which is thus signified by <em>Daniel</em>:<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> <em>And in the end of years they</em> [the kings of the <em>South</em> and <em>North</em>] <em>shall join themselves together: for the king's daughter of the</em> South [<em>Berenice</em>] <em>shall come to the king of the </em>North<em> to make an agreement, but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p177"> &lt;177&gt; </span> <em>she stand, nor her seed, but she shall be delivered up, and he</em> [<em>Callinicus</em>] <em>that brought her, and he whom she brought forth, and they that strengthned her in</em> [those] <em>times</em>, [or defended her in the siege of <em>Daphne</em>.] <em>But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his seat</em> [her brother <em>Euergetes</em>] <em>who shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress</em> [or fenced cities] <em>of the king of the </em>North<em>, and shall act against them and prevail: and shall carry captives into </em>Egypt<em>, their Gods with their Princes and precious vessels of silver and gold; and he shall continue some years after the king of the</em> North.</p>
<p id="par8"><em>Seleucus Ceraunus</em>, inheriting the remains of his father's kingdom, and thinking to recover the rest, raised a great army against the governor of <em>Pergamus</em>, now King thereof, but died in the third year of his reign. His brother and successor, <em>Antiochus Magnus</em>, carrying on the war, took from the King of <em>Pergamus</em> almost all the lesser <em>Asia</em>, recovering also the Provinces of <em>Media</em>, <em>Persia</em> and <em>Babylonia</em>, from the governors who had revolted: and in the fifth year of his reign invading <em>Cœlosyria</em>, he with little opposition possest himself of a good part thereof; and the next year returning to invade the rest of <em>Cœlosyria</em> and <em>Phœnicia</em>, beat the army of <em>Ptolemy Philopator</em> near <em>Berytus</em>; he then in<a id="l5"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p178"> &lt;178&gt; </span>vaded <em>Palestine</em> and the neighbouring parts of <em>Arabia</em>, and the third year returned with an army of 78000: but <em>Ptolemy</em> coming out of <em>Egypt</em> with an army of 75000, fought and routed him at <em>Raphia</em> near <em>Gaza</em>, between <em>Palestine</em> and <em>Egypt</em>; and recovered all <em>Phœnicia</em> and <em>Cœlosyria</em>, <em>Ann.

Being puffed up with this victory, and living in all manner of luxury, the <em>Egyptians</em> revolted, and had wars with him, but were overcome; and in the broils sixty thousand <em>Egyptian Jews</em> were slain.

<p id="par9">About twelve years after the battle between <em>Philopator</em> and <em>Antiochus</em>, <em>Philopator</em> died; and left his kingdom to his young son <em>Ptolemy Epiphanes</em>, a child of five years old. Thereupon <em>Antiochus Magnus</em> confederated with <em>Philip</em> king of <em>Macedon</em>, that they should each invade the dominions of <em>Epiphanes</em> which lay next to them. Hence arose a various war between <em>Antiochus</em> and <em>Epiphanes</em>, each of them seizing <em>Phœnicia</em> and <em>Cœlosyria</em> by turns; whereby those countries were much afflicted by both parties. First <em>Antiochus</em> seized them; then one <em>Scopas</em> being sent with the army of <em>Egypt</em>, recovered them from <em>Antiochus</em>: the next year, <em>An. Nabonass.</em> 550, <em>Antiochus</em> fought and routed <em>Scopas</em> near the fountains of <em>Jordan</em>, besieged him in <em>Sidon</em>, took the city, and recovered <em>Syria</em> and <em>Phœnicia</em> from <em>Egypt</em>, the <em>Jews</em> coming over to him voluntarily. But about three years after, preparing for a war against the <em>Romans</em>, he came to <em>Raphia</em> on the borders of <em>Egypt</em>; made peace with <em>Epiphanes</em>, and gave him his daughter <em>Cleopatra</em>: next autumn he passed the <em>Hellespont</em> to invade the cities of <em>Greece</em> under the <em>Roman</em> protection, and took some of them; but was beaten by the <em>Romans</em> the summer following, and forced to return back with his army into <em>Asia</em>. Before the end of the year the fleet of <em>Antiochus</em> was beaten by the fleet of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p180"> &lt;180&gt; </span> the <em>Romans</em> near <em>Phocæa</em>: and at the same time <em>Epiphanes</em> and <em>Cleopatra</em> sent an embassy to <em>Rome</em> to congratulate the <em>Romans</em> on their success against their father <em>Antiochus</em>, and to exhort them to prosecute the war against him into <em>Asia</em>. The <em>Romans</em> beat <em>Antiochus</em> again at sea near <em>Ephesus</em>, past their army over the <em>Hellespont</em>, and obtain'd a great victory over him by land, took from him all <em>Asia</em> westward of mount <em>Taurus</em>, gave it to the King of <em>Pergamus</em> who assisted them in the war; and imposed a large tribute upon <em>Antiochus</em>. Thus the King of <em>Pergamus</em>, by the power of the <em>Romans</em>, recovered what <em>Antiochus</em> had taken from him; and <em>Antiochus</em> retiring into the remainder of his kingdom, was slain two years after by the <em>Persians</em>, as he was robbing the Temple of <em>Jupiter Belus</em> in <em>Elymais</em>, to raise money for the <em>Romans</em>. All which is thus described by <em>Daniel</em>.<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> <em>For the King of the</em> North [<em>Antiochus</em>] <em>shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; and shall certainly come, after certain years, with a great army and with much riches. And in those times there shall many stand up against the King of the</em> South, [particularly the <em>Macedonians</em>;] <em>also the robbers of thy people</em> [the <em>Samaritans</em>, &amp;c.] <em>shall exalt themselves to establish the vision, but they shall fall. So the King of the </em>North<em> shall come, and</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p181"> &lt;181&gt; </span> <em>cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities; and the arms of the </em>South<em> shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand. But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which shall fail in his hand. He shall also set his face to go with the strength</em> [or army] <em>of all his kingdom, and make an agreement with him</em> [at <em>Raphia</em>;] <em>and he shall give him the daughter of women corrupting her; but she shall not stand his side, neither be for him. After this he shall turn his face unto the Isles, and shall take many: but a Prince for his own behalf</em> [the <em>Romans</em>] <em>shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him. Then he shall turn his face towards the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</em></p>
<p id="par10"><em>Seleucus Philopator</em> succeeded his father <em>Antiochus</em>, <em>Anno Nabonass.</em> 561, and reigned twelve years, but did nothing memorable, being sluggish, and intent upon raising money for the <em>Romans</em> to whom he was tributary. He was slain by <em>Heliodorus</em>, whom he had sent to rob the Temple of <em>Jerusalem</em>. <em>Daniel</em> thus describes his reign.<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> <em>Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom, but within</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p182"> &lt;182&gt; </span> <em>few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger nor in battle.</em></p>
<p id="par11">A little before the death of <em>Philopator</em>, his son <em>Demetrius</em> was sent hostage to <em>Rome</em>, in the place of <em>Antiochus Epiphanes</em>, the brother of <em>Philopator</em>; and <em>Antiochus</em> was at <em>Athens</em> in his way home from <em>Rome</em>, when <em>Philopator</em> died: whereupon <em>Heliodorus</em> the treasurer of the kingdom, stept into the throne. But <em>Antiochus</em> so managed his affairs, that the <em>Romans</em> kept <em>Demetrius</em> at <em>Rome</em>; and their ally the King of <em>Pergamus</em> expelled <em>Heliodorus</em>, and placed <em>Antiochus</em> in the throne, while <em>Demetrius</em> the right heir remained an hostage at <em>Rome</em>. <em>Antiochus</em> being thus made King by the friendship of the King of <em>Pergamus</em> reigned powerfully over <em>Syria</em> and the neighbouring nations: but carried himself much below his dignity, stealing privately out of his palace, rambling up and down the city in disguise with one or two of his companions; conversing and drinking with people of the lowest rank, foreigners and strangers; frequenting the meetings of dissolute persons to feast and revel; clothing himself like the <em>Roman</em> candidates and officers, acting their parts like a mimick, and in publick festivals jesting and dancing with servants and light people, exposing himself by all manner of ridiculous gestures. This conduct made some <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p183"> &lt;183&gt; </span> take him for a madman, and call him <em>Antiochus</em> Ἐπιμένης. In the first year of his reign he deposed <em>Onias</em> the high-Priest, and sold the high-Priesthood to <em>Jason</em> the younger brother of <em>Onias</em>: for <em>Jason</em> had promised to give him 440 talents of silver for that office, and 150 more for a licence to erect a place of exercise for the training up of youth in the fashions of the heathen; which licence was granted by the King, and put in execution by <em>Jason</em>. Then the King sending one <em>Apollonius</em> into <em>Egypt</em> to the coronation of <em>Ptolemy Philometor</em>, the young son of <em>Philometor</em> and <em>Cleopatra</em>, and knowing <em>Philometor</em> not to be well affected to his affairs in <em>Phœnicia</em>, provided for his own safety in those parts; and for that end came to <em>Joppa</em> and <em>Jerusalem</em>, where he was honourably received; from thence he went in like manner with his little army to the cities of <em>Phœnicia</em>, to establish himself against <em>Egypt</em>, by courting the people, and distributing extraordinary favours amongst them. All which is thus represented by <em>Daniel</em>.<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> <em>And in his</em> [<em>Philometor</em>'s] <em>estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they</em> [the <em>Syrians</em> who set up <em>Heliodorus</em>] <em>shall not give the honour of the kingdom. Yet he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries</em> [made principally to the King of <em>Pergamus</em>;] <em>and the arms</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p184"> &lt;184&gt; </span> [which in favour of <em>Heliodorus</em> oppose him] <em>shall be overflowed with a flood from before him, and be broken; yea also</em> [<em>Onias</em> the high-Priest] <em>the Prince of the covenant. And after the league made with him,</em> [the King of <em>Egypt</em>, by sending <em>Apollonius</em> to his coronation] <em>he shall work deceitfully</em> [against the King of <em>Egypt</em>,] <em>for he shall come up and shall become strong</em> [in <em>Phœnicia </em>] <em>with a small people. And he shall enter into the quiet and plentiful cities of the Province</em> [of <em>Phœnicia</em>;] <em>and</em> [to ingratiate himself with the <em>Jews</em> of <em>Phœnicia</em> and <em>Egypt</em>, and with their friends] <em>he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers fathers: he shall scatter among them the prey and the spoil, and the riches</em> [exacted from other places;] <em>and shall forecast his devices against the strong holds</em> [of <em>Egypt</em>] <em>even for a time.</em></p>
<p id="par12">These things were done in the first year of his reign, <em>An. Nabonass.</em> 573. And thenceforward he forecast his devices against the strong holds of <em>Egypt</em>, until the sixth year. For three years after, that is in the fourth year of his reign, <em>Menelaus</em> bought the high-Priesthood from <em>Jason</em>, but not paying the price was sent for by the King; and the King, before he could hear the cause, went into <em>Cilicia</em> to appease a sedition there, and left <em>Andronicus</em> his deputy at <em>Antioch</em>; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p185"> &lt;185&gt; </span> in the mean time the brother of <em>Menelaus</em>, to make up the money, conveyed several vessels out of the Temple, selling some of them at <em>Tyre</em>, and sending others to <em>Andronicus</em>. When <em>Menelaus</em> was reproved for this by <em>Onias</em>, he caused <em>Onias</em> to be slain by <em>Andronicus</em>: for which fact the King at his return from <em>Cilicia</em> caused <em>Andronicus</em> to be put to death. Then <em>Antiochus</em> prepared his second expedition against <em>Egypt</em>, which he performed in the sixth year of his reign, <em>An. Nabonass.</em> 578: for upon the death of <em>Cleopatra</em>, the governors of her son the young King of <em>Egypt</em> claimed <em>Phœnicia</em> and <em>Cœlosyria</em> from him as her dowry; and to recover those countries raised a great army. <em>Antiochus</em> <sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup>considering that his father had not quitted the possession of those countries, denied they were her dowry; and with another great army met and fought the <em>Egyptians</em> on the borders of <em>Egypt</em>, between <em>Pelusium</em> and the mountain <em>Casius</em>. He there beat them, and might have destroyed their whole army, but that he rode up and down, commanding his soldiers not to kill them, but to take them alive: by which humanity he gained <em>Pelusium</em>, and soon after all <em>Egypt</em>; entring it with a vast multitude of foot and chariots, elephants and horsemen, and a great navy. Then seizing the cities of <em>Egypt</em> as a friend, he marched to <em>Memphis</em>, laid the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p186"> &lt;186&gt; </span> whole blame of the war upon <em>Eulæus</em> the King's governor, entred into outward friendship with the young King, and took upon him to order the affairs of the kingdom. While <em>Antiochus</em> was thus employ'd, a report being spread in <em>Phœnicia</em> that he was dead, <em>Jason</em> to recover the high-Priesthood assaulted <em>Jerusalem</em> with above a thousand men, and took the city: hereupon the King thinking <em>Judea</em> had revolted, came out of <em>Egypt</em> in a furious manner, re-took the city, slew forty thousand of the people, made as many prisoners, and sold them to raise money; went into the Temple, spoiled it of its treasures, ornaments, utensils, and vessels of gold and silver, amounting to 1800 talents; and carried all away to <em>Antioch</em>. This was done in the year of <em>Nabonassar</em> 578, and is thus described by <em>Daniel</em>.<sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> <em>And he shall stir up his power, and his courage against the King of the </em>South<em> with a great army; and the King of the </em>South<em> shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they</em>, even <em>Antiochus</em> and his friends, <em>shall forecast devices against him</em>, as is represented above; <em>yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat, shall</em> betray and <em>destroy him, and his army shall be overthrown, and many shall fall down slain. And both these Kings hearts shall be to do</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p187"> &lt;187&gt; </span> <em>mischief; and they</em>, being now made friends, <em>shall speak lyes at one table</em>, against the <em>Jews</em> and against the holy covenant; <em>but it shall not prosper: for yet the end</em>, in which the setting up of the abomination of desolation is to prosper, <em>shall be at the time appointed. Then shall he return into his land with great riches, and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall act</em>, against it by spoiling the Temple, <em>and return into his own land</em>.</p>
<p id="par13">The <em>Egyptians</em> of <em>Alexandria</em> seeing <em>Philometor</em> first educated in luxury by the Eunuch <em>Eulæus</em>, and now in the hands of <em>Antiochus</em>, gave the kingdom to <em>Euergetes</em>, the younger brother of <em>Philometor</em>. Whereupon <em>Antiochus</em> pretending to restore <em>Philometor</em>, made war upon <em>Euergetes</em>; beat him at sea, and besieged him and his sister <em>Cleopatra</em> in <em>Alexandria</em>: while the besieged Princes sent to <em>Rome</em> to implore the assistance of the Senate. <em>Antiochus</em> finding himself unable to take the city that year, returned into <em>Syria</em>, leaving <em>Philometor</em> at <em>Memphis</em> to govern <em>Egypt</em> in his absence. But <em>Philometor</em> made friendship with his brother that winter; and <em>Antiochus</em>, returning the next spring <em>An. Nabonass.</em> 580, to besiege both the brothers in <em>Alexandria</em>, was met in the way by the <em>Roman</em> Ambassadors, <em>Popilius Læna</em>, <em>C. Decimius</em>, and <em>C. Hostilius</em>: he offered them his hand to kiss, but <em>Popi<a id="l6"></a></em><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p188"> &lt;188&gt; </span><em>lius</em> delivering to him the tables wherein the message of the Senate was written, bad him read those first. When he had read them, he replied he would consider with his friends what was fit to be done; but <em>Popilius</em> drawing a circle about him, bad him answer before he went out of it: <em>Antiochus</em>, astonished at this blunt and unusual imperiousness, made answer he would do what the <em>Romans</em> demanded; and then <em>Popilius</em> gave the King his hand to kiss, and he returned out of <em>Egypt</em>. The same year, <em>An. Nabonass.</em> 580, his captains by his order spoiled and slaughtered the <em>Jews</em>, profaned the Temple, set up the worship of the heathen Gods in all <em>Judea</em>, and began to persecute and make war upon those who would not worship them: which actions are thus described by <em>Daniel</em>.<sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> <em>At the time appointed he shall come</em> again <em>towards the </em>South<em>, but the latter shall not be as the former. For the ships of </em>Chittim<em> shall come</em>, with an embassy from <em>Rome</em>, <em>against him. Therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant. So shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</em></p>
<p id="par14">In the same year that <em>Antiochus</em> by the command of the <em>Romans</em> retired out of <em>Egypt</em>, and set up the worship of the <em>Greeks</em> in <em>Judea</em>; the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p189"> &lt;189&gt; </span> <em>Romans</em> conquered the kingdom of <em>Macedon</em>, the fundamental kingdom of the Empire of the <em>Greeks</em>, and reduced it into a <em>Roman</em> Province; and thereby began to put an end to the reign of <em>Daniel</em>'s third Beast. This is thus exprest by <em>Daniel</em>. <em>And after him Arms</em>, that is the <em>Romans</em>, <em>shall stand up</em>. As ממלך signifies <em>after the King</em>, Dan. xi. 8; so ממנו may signify <em>after him</em>. <em>Arms</em> are every where in this Prophecy of <em>Daniel</em> put for the military power of a kingdom: and they stand up when they conquer and grow powerful. Hitherto <em>Daniel</em> described the actions of the Kings of the <em>North</em> and <em>South</em>; but upon the conquest of <em>Macedon</em> by the <em>Romans</em>, he left off describing the actions of the <em>Greeks</em>, and began to describe those of the <em>Romans</em> in <em>Greece</em>. They conquered <em>Macedon</em>, <em>Illyricum</em> and <em>Epirus</em>, in the year of <em>Nabonassar</em> 580. 35 years after, by the last will and testament of <em>Attalus</em> the last King of <em>Pergamus</em>, they inherited that rich and flourishing kingdom, that is, all <em>Asia</em> westward of mount <em>Taurus</em>; 69 years after they conquered the kingdom of <em>Syria</em>, and reduced it into a Province, and 34 years after they did the like to <em>Egypt</em>. By all these steps the <em>Roman</em> Arms stood up over the <em>Greeks</em>: and after 95 years more, by making war upon the <em>Jews</em>, <em>they polluted the sanctuary of strength, and took</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p190"> &lt;190&gt; </span> <em>away the daily sacrifice, and then placed the abomination of desolation</em>. For this abomination was placed after the days of <em>Christ</em>, <em>Math.</em> xxiv. 15. In the 16th year of the Emperor <em>Adrian</em>, A.C. 132, they placed this abomination by building a Temple to <em>Jupiter Capitolinus</em>, where the Temple of God in <em>Jerusalem</em> had stood. Thereupon the <em>Jews</em> under the conduct of <em>Barchochab</em> rose up in arms against the <em>Romans</em>, and in the war had 50 cities demolished, 985 of their best towns destroyed, and 580000 men slain by the sword; and in the end of the war, A.C. 136, were banished <em>Judea</em> upon pain of death, and thenceforward the land remained desolate of its old inhabitants.</p>
<p id="par15">In the beginning of the <em>Jewish</em> war in <em>Nero</em>'s reign, the Apostles fled out of <em>Judea</em> with their flocks; some beyond <em>Jordan</em> to <em>Pella</em> and other places, some into <em>Egypt</em>, <em>Syria</em>, <em>Mesopotamia</em>, <em>Asia minor</em>, and elsewhere. <em>Peter</em> and <em>John</em> came into <em>Asia</em>, and <em>Peter</em> went thence by <em>Corinth</em> to <em>Rome</em>; but <em>John</em> staying in <em>Asia</em>, was banished by the <em>Romans</em> into <em>Patmos</em>, as the head of a party of the <em>Jews</em>, whose nation was in war with the <em>Romans</em>. By this dispersion of the <em>Christian Jews</em>, the <em>Christian</em> religion, which was already propagated westward as far as <em>Rome</em>, spred fast into all the <em>Roman</em> Empire, and suffered many persecutions under it till the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p191"> &lt;191&gt; </span> days of <em>Constantine</em> the great and his sons: all which is thus described by <em>Daniel</em>.<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> <em>And such as do wickedly against the covenant, shall he</em>, who places the abomination, <em>cause to dissemble</em>, and worship the heathen Gods; <em>but the people</em> among them <em>who do know their God, shall be strong and act. And they that understand among the people, shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by spoil many days. Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help, viz.</em> in the reign of <em>Constantine</em> the great; <em>and</em> at that time by reason of their prosperity, <em>many shall</em> come over to them from among the heathen, and <em>cleave to them with dissimulation. But of those of understanding there shall</em> still <em>fall to try</em> God's people <em>by them, and to purge</em> them from the dissemblers, <em>and to make them white even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.</em></p>
<p id="par16">Hitherto the <em>Roman</em> Empire continued entire; and under this dominion, the little horn of the He-Goat continued <em>mighty, but not by his own power</em>. But now, by the building of <em>Constantinople</em>, and endowing it with a Senate and other like privileges with <em>Rome</em>; and by the division of the <em>Roman</em> Empire into the two Empires of the <em>Greeks</em> and <em>Latins</em>, headed by those two cities; a new scene of things commences, in <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p192"> &lt;192&gt; </span>  which <sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup><em>a King</em>, the Empire of the <em>Greeks</em>, <em>doth according to his will, and</em>, by setting his own laws above the laws of God, <em>exalts and magnifies himself above every God, and speaks marvellous things against the God of Gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished. —— Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the</em> lawful <em>desire of women</em> in matrimony, <em>nor any God, but shall magnify himself above all. And in his seat he shall honour </em>Mahuzzims, that is, strong guardians, the souls of the dead; <em>even with a God whom his fathers knew not shall he honour them</em>, in their Temples, <em>with gold and silver, and with precious stones and valuable things</em>. All which relates to the overspreading of the <em>Greek</em> Empire with Monks and Nuns, who placed holiness in abstinence from marriage; and to the invocation of saints and veneration of their reliques, and such like superstitions, which these men introduced in the fourth and fifth centuries. <sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup><em>And at the time of the end the King of the</em> South, or the Empire of the <em>Saracens</em>, <em>shall push at him</em>; <em>and the King of the</em> North, or Empire of the <em>Turks</em>, <em>shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots and with horsemen, and with many ships</em>; <em>and he shall enter into the countries</em> of the <em>Greeks</em>, <em>and shall overflow and pass over.

All these nations compose the Empire of the <em>Turks</em>, and therefore this Empire is here to be understood by the King of the <em>North</em>. They compose also the body of the He-Goat; and therefore the Goat still reigns in his last horn, but not by his own power.</p>
