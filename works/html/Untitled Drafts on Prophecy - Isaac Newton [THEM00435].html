<p id="par16">7 Valentinian divided the Empire between himself &amp; his brother Valens <a id="l69"></a>&amp; from that time the Empire continued divided excepting the last three <a id="l70"></a>months of the reign of Theodosius which is too short a time to be worth <a id="l71"></a>considering.

<p id="par17">In the time of the sixt head the Empire became divided at the death <a id="l76"></a>of Constantine the great &amp; reunited by the victory of Constantius over <a id="l77"></a>Magnentius &amp; this is exprest by saying   that the Beast (or western Empire) was wounded to death in on one of his heads &amp; that he was &amp; is not &amp; shall <a id="l79"></a>ascend out of the abyss &amp; go into perdition, &amp; that  five  kings are fallen &amp; one is &amp; another is not <a id="l80"></a>come &amp; when he cometh he must continue a short space &amp; the Beast that <a id="l81"></a>was &amp; is not he is the eighth &amp; is of the seven &amp; goeth into perdition.

If it be objected that <a id="l92"></a>five heads were fallen before the days of the Prophet I answer that the <a id="l93"></a>Prophesy is not of things past. Nothing is more usual in prophesy then to speak of <a id="l94"></a>times future as present in the visions,  The phrases <em class="underline">five are fallen &amp; one is</em> <a id="l95"></a>&amp; the Beast which <em class="underline">was &amp; is not</em> have only relation to one another &amp; signify <a id="l96"></a>nothing more then that in the time of the sixt head the Beast ceases to be for <a id="l97"></a>a time being wounded to death in that head. Iohn in taking a view of the <a id="l98"></a>great Whore &amp; her Beast descends to the time next preceding their being in <a id="l99"></a>the wilderness, in that time he is carried in the spirit into the Wilderness to see them <a id="l100"></a>&amp; with respect to that time as present in the Vision saith five are fallen &amp; <a id="l101"></a>one is, &amp; the Beast was &amp; is not.

<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">THE SEALES OPENED.</h2>
<p id="par18">By the opening of the seven seales the Roman Empire is distinguished <a id="l104"></a>into seven successive Reigns Dynasties or kings the four first of which are represented by – four horsmen, &amp; these are the seven heads, <a id="l105"></a>of the Dragon &amp; Beast.  At the opening of the first seale the first Beast which was like a Lion <a id="l106"></a>&amp; stood eastward called Iohn to come &amp; see, &amp; he   <em class="underline">saw</em> <a id="l107"></a><em class="underline">&amp; behold a white horse &amp; he that sat on him had a bow &amp; a crown was given <a id="l108"></a>unto him &amp; he went forth conquering &amp; to conquer</em>. By the crown  <a id="l109"></a>the horsmen are kings &amp; by the bow this king is a conqueror &amp; by the white <a id="l110"></a>horse he is a very good man, &amp; by the situation of the first Beast he was <a id="l111"></a>an eastern Emperor. All which is true of Vespasian the first Emperor of the <a id="l112"></a>first dynasty of kings who reigned next after the writing of the Prophesy. He <a id="l113"></a>was created Emperor in Iudea which was eastward from Rome,  <a id="l114"></a>&amp; was an excellent Emperor &amp; at that time there was a rumour in <a id="l115"></a>all the east occasioned by the prophesy of Daniels' weeks that there <a id="l116"></a>should arise a great king in  Iudea, &amp; this the heathens recconed <a id="l117"></a>accomplished in Vespasian. He went forth conquering the Iewish nation <a id="l118"></a> dissolved their polity &amp; burnt Ierusalem &amp; the Temple: things of that <a id="l119"></a>consequence  in religion that they deserved to be taken notice of in this <a id="l120"></a>prophesy. In destroying Christs enemies the Iews, he may be recconed the <a id="l121"></a>Minister or Deputy of Christ.</p>
<p id="par19">At the opening of the second seale, the second Beast which  had the face on an Ox the type of slaughter &amp; stood <a id="l122"></a>westward from the throne called Iohn to  come &amp; look westward &amp; <a id="l123"></a> <em class="underline">then went forth</em> <em class="underline">a red horse &amp; power was given to him that sat thereon to take <a id="l124"></a>peace from the earth &amp; that they should kill one another &amp; there was <a id="l125"></a>given him a great sword</em>. All which agrees to Trajan the first Emperor <a id="l126"></a>of the second Dynasty. This Dynasty was of Spaniards a people westward <a id="l127"></a>from Rome &amp; Trajan was the greatest conqueror of all the Roman <a id="l128"></a>Emperors  since the writing of the <a id="l130"></a>prophesy. The Empire was almost dissolved by the seditions &amp; defections <a id="l131"></a>in Nero's reign &amp; something repaired by Vespasian &amp; again made to totter <a id="l132"></a>by Domitian. Trajan not only setled it but enlarged it by foreign conquests <a id="l133"></a>more then ever did any other Emperor; insomuch that Historians <a id="l134"></a>reccon the ἀκμὴ of the Empire to have been in his reign, &amp; the <a id="l135"></a>Emperor Iulian in his Cæsars singling out Iulius Cæsar, Octavius, <a id="l136"></a>Trajan, Marcus &amp; Constantine as the five gallantest of all the Roman <a id="l137"></a>Emperors to compare with Alexander the great, calls Iulius Octavius &amp; <a id="l138"></a>Trajan the worst warlike &amp; in conclusion  allots Trajan to keep <a id="l139"></a>company with Alexander. He was the first that propagated the Empire <a id="l140"></a>beyond the Danube &amp; having conquered &amp; almost depopulated Dacia by <a id="l141"></a>war he repeopled it with great numbers from several parts of the empire.  He gave a king to the Albani, &amp; received those  of Iberia &amp; Colchos <a id="l144"></a>&amp; the Cimmeneian Bosphori &amp; Sauromata into the Empire. He seized the regions of the Saracens &amp; Arabians &amp; reduced <a id="l145"></a>Arabia into the form of a Province. He recovered Armenia from the Parthians <a id="l146"></a>&amp;  conquered Mesopotamia &amp; Assyria reducing them into the form of <a id="l147"></a>Provinces &amp; was the first that extended the Empire beyond the Euphrates. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003v"> &lt;3v&gt; </span> He subdued the Cordueni &amp; Mardomedi  &amp; <a id="l148"></a>Seleucia &amp; Ctesiphon &amp; Babylonia &amp;  made the king of Parthia give him hostages &amp; went as far as India &amp; built a navy in the <a id="l149"></a>Persian gulph to invade the Indians.  In his letters to the senate he gave them account of <a id="l150"></a>so many conquered nations that they neither knew them all nor could number them &amp; therefore besides <a id="l151"></a>other honours they erected to him a triumphal arch in the market place of Rome &amp; decried <a id="l152"></a>that he might triumph of as many nations as he pleased. But when he was upon the sea the <a id="l153"></a>conquered nations  revolted &amp; slew the garrisons upon which followed great confusion &amp; slaughters on both sides. <a id="l154"></a>The Iews also in Libya  Cyrene &amp; Egypt  &amp; Thebais &amp; Cyprus  revolted &amp; slew great multitudes of the Romans <a id="l155"></a>&amp; Greeks putting them to various deaths &amp; eating their flesh. Dion reccons 200000 slain  about Cyrene &amp; 240000 in Cyprus &amp; <a id="l156"></a>the like slaughter in Egypt. Whereupon Trajan sent captains against them  who slew vast multitudes of them &amp; because they were very numerous in <a id="l158"></a>Mesopotamia he commanded that they should be all slain &amp; rooted out of that Province &amp; <a id="l159"></a>accordingly vast numbers of them were slain there. From all which slaughters his <a id="l160"></a> horse is represented of a red colour the embleme of bloodshed.</p>
<p id="par20">At the opening of the third seal the third Beast which had a humane face <a id="l161"></a>&amp; stood southward from the throne called Iohn to come &amp; look  southward. <em class="underline">And lo a <a id="l162"></a>black horse &amp; he that sat on him had a pair of Ballances in his hand &amp; Iohn <a id="l163"></a>heard a voice in the midst of the four Beasts say, A  Chænix of wheat for a penny &amp; <a id="l164"></a> four Chænixes of Barley for a penny &amp; see thou hurt not the oyle &amp; the wine</em>. All which <a id="l165"></a>is the exact character of Severus the  founder of the  southern Dynasty. <a id="l166"></a></p>
<p id="par21">A pair of ballances denotes a Iudge,  just or injust accordingly as the ballance <a id="l169"></a> is true or false  sincere or bruised; &amp; such was Severus.  In his childhood he used <a id="l170"></a>no other play  then of walking with the fasces axes before him &amp; of sitting <a id="l171"></a>with the boys about him &amp; acting the Iudge. At the age of 32 years he was designed Prætor <a id="l172"></a>by the Emperor Marcus. When he came to be Emperor he heard causes all the morning <a id="l173"></a>till noon was severely just &amp; inexorable against criminals, made excellent laws, left his deputy judge when war <a id="l174"></a>required him to lead the army, &amp; instituted his sons in the law, &amp; from him that study <a id="l175"></a>took such encouragement that I know not any other age of the Empire where a <a id="l176"></a>greater number of famous Lawyers are recorded then that which followed his <a id="l177"></a>reign most of which were the auditors of Papinian his special favorite. The <a id="l178"></a>voice in the midst of the four Beasts respects Rome the center of the Empire <a id="l179"></a>&amp; there the measure by which the corn in the publick granaries was dispensed <a id="l180"></a> for the sustenance of the people was a Chænix The proclamation A Chænix for a penny denotes plenty &amp; Severus was the first who increased the corn in the publick storehouses of Rome &amp; so far as I can find he was the first that gave them oyle, &amp; gave it gratis.   When Severus had newly conquered <a id="l184"></a>Albinus in writing an angry letter to the Senate he thus commemorates his benefactions &amp; upbraids them for their <a id="l185"></a>ingratitude. Ego frumenta reip. detuli; ego multa bella pro rep. gessi, Ego populo <a id="l186"></a>Romano tantum olei detuli puantum rerum natura vix habuit. Ego interfecto P. <a id="l187"></a>Nigro vos a malis tyrannis liberavi. Magnam sana mihi reddidistis vicem magnam <a id="l188"></a>consulvit ut excedens vita septem annorum Canonem populo Romana relin<a id="l189"></a>querat ita ut quotidiana septuagena quina millia modiorum expendi possent: <a id="l190"></a>olei verò tantum ut per quinquennium non solem Vrbis usibus sed et totius <a id="l191"></a>Italiæ, quæ oleo egeret, sufficeret.  Whence Casaubon by recconing eight Chænixes to a bushel collects that there were 600000 persons in the turba frumentaria of that city. Severus gave also a very fertile field to the <a id="l193"></a>city which I suppose was for vines. The black colour of his horse is  a type <a id="l194"></a>of funerals of great men such whose funerals then used &amp; still use to be solemnized in <a id="l195"></a>this mourning colour. And for the slaughter of such his reign was so infamous as much to <a id="l196"></a>transcend the reigns of the worst tyrants Nero Domitian &amp; Commodus. When he overcame <a id="l197"></a>Piscenius Niger in Syria he shewed much cruelty by which &amp; the austerity of his manners <a id="l198"></a>(for he was against his enemies very cruel &amp; inexorable) the senate &amp; Citizens of Rome <a id="l199"></a>became so disaffected to him as in his  war  with Albinus to favour his enemy <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> Whereupon he put to death great multitudes of men &amp; weomen of the best <a id="l200"></a>quality in Spain &amp; Gallia where Albinus reigned &amp; was conquered &amp; afterwards <a id="l201"></a>in Italy at his return thither  &amp; confiscating their estates gave more to the soldiers &amp; left more to his sons then any other Emperor Amongst the rest he slew very many of the <a id="l202"></a>Senators  the letters which he found with <a id="l203"></a>Albinus betraying them. Spartian names 41  Senators whom he put to death <a id="l204"></a>without hearing them, &amp; then adds Horum igitur tantorum ac tam illustrium <a id="l205"></a>virorum (nam multi in his Consulares, multi prætorij, omnes certe summi viri fuere) <a id="l206"></a>interfector, ab Afris et Deus habetur. – Damnabantur autem plerique cur <a id="l207"></a>jocati essent, alij cur tacuissent, alij cur pleraque figuratè dixissent ut quod <a id="l208"></a>esset Imperator vere sui nominis verè Pertinax verè Severus.– Multos <a id="l209"></a>insuper quasi Chaldæos aut vates de sua salute consuluissent interemit, præ<a id="l210"></a>cipuè suspectans unumquemque idoneum imperio – Infinita multorum cæde <a id="l211"></a>crudelior habitus.  Spartian in Severo. Innumeros Senatores interemit et ab alijs Scyllæ Punici ab alijs Marij nomen accepit. Spartian. in Piscen. Nigro. Omnes senatus Principes &amp; singularum <a id="l212"></a>Provinciarum nobilissimos &amp; ditissimos quosque interfecit. Auri enim avidissimus <a id="l213"></a>fuit ut fortitudinem vinceret avaritia.

<p id="par22">And at the opening of the fourth seal  the fourth <a id="l216"></a>beast which stood northward from the throne called Iohn to come &amp;  looke  <a id="l217"></a>northward  &amp; Iohn looked <em class="underline">&amp; behold a pale horse &amp; his name that <a id="l218"></a>sat on him was death &amp; the grave followed with him &amp; power was given <a id="l219"></a>unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword &amp; with <a id="l220"></a>hunger &amp; with death &amp; with the Beasts of the earth.</em> This character agrees <a id="l221"></a>fully to Decius the first Emperor of the northern Dynasty. He rode on a <a id="l222"></a><em class="underline">pale horse</em> &amp; his name was <em class="underline">death</em>.  &amp; this was thus fulfilled; The Scythians from Tanais invading <a id="l223"></a>Thrace, Decius beat them at first, but pursuing  them to the banks of <a id="l224"></a>Tanais &amp; there endeavouring to attack them through a lake, he stuck <a id="l225"></a>fast &amp; perished with his son &amp; his whole army. He was followed by <em class="underline">death</em> &amp; the <em class="underline">grave</em> <a id="l226"></a>who had power over the fourth part of the earth  (that is above the Roman Empire which was about a fourth part of the habitable world then known) to kill with the <em class="underline">sword</em> &amp; with <em class="underline">hunger</em> &amp; with <em class="underline">death</em> <a id="l229"></a>&amp; with the <em class="underline">Beasts of the earth</em>, that is with civil wars with famin with pestilence &amp; <a id="l230"></a>with forreign  kingdoms or nations invading the Empire.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">2 Of the sword.</h2>
<p id="par23" class="i0">Vpon the death of Decius &amp; his army the Empire soon fell into very great disorders <a id="l231"></a>as well by civil wars as by forreign invasions. so that between Decius &amp; <a id="l232"></a>Dioclesian that is within the space of 33 years, of about 21 legitimate <a id="l233"></a>Emperors &amp; Cesars (besides seven tyrannical ones who perished all by the <a id="l234"></a>sword) there died only Licinian &amp; Claudius by the pestilence &amp; Carus <a id="l235"></a>by lightening &amp; three more were slain by the publick enemy &amp; all the <a id="l236"></a>rest fell by the sword of one another or of their own soldiers. <a id="l237"></a>And besides all these, within the fifteen years reign of Gallienus who <a id="l238"></a>was one of the one &amp; twenty, there arose no less then 29 or 30 other <a id="l239"></a>Tyrannical Emperors some of which were as powerfull as Gallienus himself <a id="l240"></a>&amp; all these also fell by the sword except three or four who had their <a id="l241"></a>lives given them by their conquerors. What slaughters followed upon the civil <a id="l242"></a>wars between so many Emperors &amp; Tyrants may easily by imagined. I shall <a id="l243"></a>content my self with one instance. Vpon conquering Ingenuus who was saluted Empe<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span>ror by the Legions of Mœsia Gallienus was so cruel towards both soldiers <a id="l244"></a>&amp; inhabitants of Mœsia as to leave many cities void of males. His cruelty <a id="l245"></a>may be understood by this his Epistle to Verianus. . Gallienus <a id="l246"></a>Veriano: Non mihi satis facies si tantum armatos occideris quos et fors belli <a id="l247"></a>interimere potuissent: perimendus est omnis sexus virilis, si et senes atque <a id="l248"></a>impuberes sine reprehensione nostra occidi possint.

<h2 id="hd4" class="cent">3 Of the Famine &amp; Pestilence</h2>
<p id="par24">In the first year of Gallus  the successor of Decius a vehement plague began from Ethiopia &amp; went <a id="l253"></a>through all the Roman Provinces exhausting them wonderfully  <a id="l254"></a> till after the death of Claudius that is for above 15 years together. <a id="l255"></a>Vbique maximam partem incolentium exhausit, pleraque loca inhabitata reliquit: <a id="l256"></a>Lætus. Per omnia Romani regni ab oriente in occidentem spacia cùm omne <a id="l257"></a>propemodum genus hominum &amp; pecudum neci dedit, tum etiam corripuit <a id="l258"></a>lacus &amp; infecit pabula tabo: Oros. l. 7. c. 27. Nec alia unquam major <a id="l259"></a>lues mihi lecta spacio temporum sive terrarum: Lipsius de  Constant. 2. 23. <a id="l260"></a>At the same time with this plague a famin also began  which lasted longer then the plague  the wars hindering agriculture <a id="l262"></a>&amp; wasting the old stores. In Gallus's reign Dionysius Alexandrinus thus mentions <a id="l263"></a>it in his Epistle to the brethren. Post hæc (that is after the persecution of Decius) <a id="l264"></a>et bellum &amp; fames secuta sunt quæ una cum ethnicis pertulimus – At ubi <a id="l265"></a>cum nos tum ipsi respiraveramus invasit lues ista, res illis quovis terrore terri<a id="l266"></a>bilior &amp; calamitate quacunque lamentabilior, nobis verò exercitatio et <a id="l267"></a>exploratio nullis reliquis inferior.

In Claudius's reign Zosimus tells us that a body of Barba<a id="l271"></a>rians in Macedonia perished by famin with their cattel: &amp; Pollio that <a id="l272"></a> a multitude of barbarians in Thrace laboured so much under famin <a id="l273"></a>&amp; pestilence that Claudius sleighted them.

<h2 id="hd6" class="cent">2 Of the sword</h2>
<p id="par26">Vpon the death of Decius the Empire fell into disorder as well by <a id="l318"></a>civil wars as  by barbarian invasions; so that between Decius &amp; Diocle<a id="l319"></a>sian – – – – prest with famin</p>
<p id="par27">So terrible were these plagues of wars pestilence &amp; famin  in <a id="l320"></a> that Cyprian who lived in that age concluded from them that the end of the <a id="l321"></a>world was at hand, as you may understand by his Tract de Mortalitate <a id="l322"></a>&amp; yet he was martyred before the reign of Gallienus  when they were at the height.</p>
<p id="par28"> You have now the interpretation of  the four horsmen &amp; <a id="l324"></a>as there is nothing in the Prop<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>he<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>sy which has not to a tittle been fulfilled <a id="l325"></a>so the prophesy has omitted nothing remarkable enough to be a conve<a id="l326"></a>nient character of the things designed to be characterised. For what was <a id="l327"></a>there in Trajans reign very singular besides his victories &amp; the ensuing <a id="l328"></a>killing one another? What in Severus's besides his acting the Iudge <a id="l329"></a>killing the Senators &amp; great men &amp; augmenting the city provisions? What <a id="l330"></a>in Decius's but his perishing with his whole army? And what in the <a id="l331"></a>times immediately following him worth being taken notice of in compari<a id="l332"></a>son of the four plagues? I say what was there singular? For as for <a id="l333"></a>Trajan's humanity, Severus's wars, &amp; the like they were things common <a id="l334"></a>to them with divers other Emperors: whereas the Prophesy  (as was <a id="l335"></a>fit) takes notice of nothing but what was most remarkable in the kind. <a id="l336"></a>You may find other conquerors besides Trajan, other killing one another <a id="l337"></a>besides that in the Iewish war, other Iudges &amp; killers of great men &amp; <a id="l338"></a>heapers up of provisions besides Severus &amp; others perishing fatally besides <a id="l339"></a>Decius, but all the Roman History will not afford others so eminent <a id="l340"></a>in the kind as these, nor which are combined with one another <a id="l341"></a>after this manner &amp; as for the quaternary of plagues I know <a id="l342"></a>nothing like it.

For <a id="l419"></a> I reccon <a id="l420"></a>that the times of this Trumpet began A.C. 609 when  the Angel of the bottomless pit fell from heaven like a star <a id="l422"></a>&amp; received the Key of the bottomless pit that is  when Mahomet <a id="l423"></a>set up for a Prophet, &amp; that it lasted all the time  of  his successors <a id="l424"></a>the Califs, that is till the year  1258.  Togulbeck having conquered <a id="l425"></a>Chorasan &amp; Persia added Bagdad to his Empire A.C. 1055 &amp; made that city <a id="l426"></a>the  seat thereof. His successor Olub' Arslan (called also Asan, Axan, Olbarsalan <a id="l427"></a>Alpasalem &amp; Aspasalem.)   began his reign A.C. 1063 &amp; <a id="l428"></a>added Mesopotamia to his Empire &amp; took the Greek Emperor Diogenes Romanus prisoner.

And now this Empire of the Turks being  <a id="l431"></a>arrived to its ἀκμὴ, &amp;  after the death of Malechseh A.C. 1092, being left to a child who was but six years old brake into <a id="l432"></a>several smaller kingdoms or Sultanies of the Turks,  the governors  of Provinces revolting, one of which continued at Bagdad <a id="l433"></a>in the family of Togrulbec till about the year 1160,  <a id="l435"></a>the Calif of Bagdat recovered the temporal power of this Sultany which <a id="l436"></a> he had been deprived of for about 224 years. And this power <a id="l437"></a>continued from hence forward in the Calif till the year 1258 &amp; then <a id="l438"></a>Haalon or Hulacu the Tartar beseiged &amp; took  Bagdat slew <a id="l439"></a>the Calif &amp; put a full end to the Califate.  Thus ended the reign both spiritual &amp; temporal of <a id="l440"></a>the  Locusts at Bagdat under the Angel of the bottomless pit &amp; with his reign <a id="l441"></a>the times of the fift Trumpet expired.</p>

<p id="par42">In these computations I have followed the opinion of the <a id="l445"></a>Arabic Historians. For Elmacinus<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> distinguishes the Empire of  <a id="l446"></a>the Saracens into three  successive Dynasties, the <a id="l447"></a>first comprehending its rise &amp; increase during the reign of the line of Ommia <a id="l448"></a>at Damascus, the second conteining its decrease during the reign <a id="l449"></a>of the Abasides at Bagdat untill they subjected themselves to <a id="l450"></a>temporal Princes (which two  Dynasties together I interpreted <a id="l451"></a>to be the twice five months reign of the Locusts under their king the <a id="l452"></a>Angel of the bottomless pit) &amp; the third Dynasty he reccons <a id="l453"></a>to be the further continuance of this Empire after its distraction <a id="l454"></a>&amp; division into several Kingdoms most of which were governed by Saracens <a id="l455"></a>&amp; some of them by Turks. And this Dynasty ended in  the year 1258. For Abulpharajius who divides his history into <a id="l456"></a>so many Dynasties as there had been supreme Empires since the cre<a id="l457"></a>ation, &amp; reccons this Empire of the saracens in the ninth place; ex<a id="l458"></a>tends this Empire from the time of their Prophet Mahomet to the taking of <a id="l459"></a>Bagdat by the Tartars, &amp; there concludes it making the shortlived <a id="l460"></a>Empire of the Tartars then founded upon the ruins of the Saracens &amp; Turks <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> by Hulacu to be the 10<sup>th</sup> Dynasty or supreme Empire &amp; the year <a id="l461"></a>1258 to be their common period.</p>

By the <a id="l609"></a>fall of the Empire of the Assyrians &amp; the division thereof between the Medes &amp; Babylonians  the two empires of the Medes &amp; Babylonians rose up at once under <a id="l611"></a>Cyaxeres &amp; Nebuchadnezzar, &amp; they are represented by the two wings of the Lyon the first <a id="l612"></a>of Daniels four beasts. Dan. 7.4. And these continued standing together till the fall of <a id="l613"></a>Babylon, &amp; the rise of the Persian Empire. For upon the  conquest of Babylon <a id="l614"></a>by the Medes, Cyrus &amp; the Persians revolted from the Medes, I think  before the end of the year, &amp; <a id="l615"></a> beat them in battel the next year.  &amp; The king of Medes raised a new army &amp; was <a id="l616"></a>again beaten the year following &amp; lost his kingdom to  Cyrus  <a id="l620"></a>who set the Persians above the Medes,  Now Daniel continued <a id="l621"></a>only till the first year of Cyrus Dan. 1.21. &amp; yet received the prophesy of the scripture <a id="l622"></a>of truth in the third year of Cyrus Dan. X.1, the reign of Cyrus being dated in the <a id="l623"></a>first case from his conquest of the king of the Medes &amp; in the second from   his beginning to reign over the Persians. He conquered Babylon Ann. Nabonass <a id="l625"></a> 209 &amp; died anno Nabonass. 218 according to the Canon; &amp; reigned <a id="l626"></a>seven years after his conquest of the king of Medes according to Xenophon, &amp; therefore con<a id="l627"></a>quered him Anno Nabonass 211. There was no time therefore  worth <a id="l628"></a>considering  in this prophesy for the reign of the Medes after the fall of <a id="l629"></a>Babylon, &amp; therfore I  consider the Ram as reigning in his first horn  <a id="l630"></a>before the fall of Babylon, that is in the days of  the first of Daniels four Beasts, <a id="l631"></a>&amp; in his second horn in the days of the second Beast.</p>

For the Romans were descended from the Greeks <a id="l636"></a>&amp; thence Italy was called <em class="underline">Magna Græcia</em>, &amp; their ships which  within a month or two after they had conquered  the kingdom of Macedon, they sent against <a id="l638"></a>Antiochus Epiphanes then in Egypt, are called the ships of Kittim Dan. 11.20. And Kittim <a id="l639"></a>was the son of Iavan  whose posterity is represented by the Goat as <a id="l640"></a>above. And again in the prophesy of Balaam (if we may regard it as recited by Moses in favour of Israel) the Romans are called Kittim. And ships, saith he, shall come from Kittim &amp; shall afflict Assur &amp; s. a. E.</p>

<p id="par86">Now this vision of the first Temple with seven golden Candlesticks <a id="l797"></a>continues till the  opening of the seventh seal &amp; then there is a twofold representation of the great change of the <a id="l798"></a>affairs of the Church: and by allusion to the  days of expiation &amp; feast of the <a id="l799"></a>seventh month, the other by allusion to the day of the expiation &amp; feast of the seventh month <a id="l800"></a>the first Temple continues with the seven golden candlesticks  therein till the end of the feast: but if the change be  <a id="l802"></a>represented by allusion to the Babylonian captivity the first temple <a id="l803"></a>is destroyed by the Babylonians &amp; a new Temple built with two <a id="l804"></a>candlesticks &amp; two olive trees  resembling those in the second <a id="l805"></a>temple described in the vision of Zachary. In that vision the seven <a id="l806"></a>lamps were joyned to a golden bowle by seven golden pipes through <a id="l807"></a>which the oyle ran into them, &amp; the bowle stood upon a golden candlestick <a id="l808"></a>&amp; was joyned to two vessels of oyle on either side by two golden pipes <a id="l809"></a>through which the oyle ran into it, &amp; the two vessels were supported by <a id="l810"></a>two olive trees, not living trees with branches &amp; leaves but shafts, <a id="l811"></a>but shafts of olive wood. In the Apocalyps there being two golden <a id="l812"></a>candlesticks it is to be supposed that the golden bowle  is supported by two golden candlesticks one at either end,  the bowle being in an oblong form.</p>
<p id="par87">Conceive therefore that when the times of the first six seals are <a id="l814"></a>expired, the 144000 are sealed in the first Temple the Lamb standing <a id="l815"></a>before the throne untill the vision of the Palm-bearing multi<a id="l816"></a>tude is at an end, &amp; that when the seventh Trumpet sounds the Lamb <a id="l817"></a>changes his shape  &amp; appears  in the form of the High Priest with a golden censer <a id="l819"></a>to offer the prayers of the saints upon the golden Altar in the same <a id="l820"></a> first Temple. I say he changes his shape: for he never appears <a id="l821"></a>in two shapes at once. And when the first six  Angels <a id="l822"></a>have sounded their Trumpets in this Temple conceive that the Lamb appeares <a id="l823"></a>again in the form an Angel coming down from heaven  &amp; setts <a id="l824"></a>his right foot upon the sea of glass &amp; his left foot upon the earth <a id="l825"></a> with the book open in his hand &amp; continues in this posture till the seven thunders <a id="l826"></a>have uttered their voices  at the sacrifices in this Temple &amp; <a id="l827"></a>then  Iohn takes the book &amp; eats it in <a id="l828"></a>order to prophesy again  And  the Angel stands up with <a id="l829"></a>his right foot on the sea &amp; his left foot on the earth &amp; in allusion <a id="l830"></a>to the Babylonian captivity  prophesies to Iohn concerning the <a id="l832"></a>building of  new Temple with two Candlesticks in it. But this <a id="l833"></a>Temple was not shewed to Iohn in the visions. All the visions appeared <a id="l834"></a>in the first Temple. Now the Lamb in the form of an Angel standing <a id="l835"></a>on the earth &amp; sea signifies the Church of Christ diffused through <a id="l836"></a>the earth &amp; sea &amp; his two feet signify the distinction of this Church <a id="l837"></a>into two Churches the Churches of the earth &amp; sea. And these are the two witnesses. <a id="l838"></a>For the  Candlesticks are churches  <span class="hspac-n" title="6 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; so are Olive trees</p>
<p id="par88" class="i10">. And two Candlesticks supporting all the seven lamps can <a id="l839"></a>signify nothing less then the church catholick.</p>
<p id="par89" class="i0">untill the Woman fled from the Temple into the wilderness &amp; ceased <a id="l840"></a>to be illuminated any longer by the light of these lamps; &amp; then in allu<a id="l841"></a>sion to the  times of the Babylonian captivity a second Temple <a id="l842"></a>is built for the worship of those those that remain in Iudea &amp; in the holy city now troden <a id="l843"></a> underfoot by the Babylonian gentiles, &amp; the outward court of this temple is left open &amp; unbuilt &amp; given to those Gentiles.</p>
<p id="par90">These two olive trees &amp; this Candlestick (suppose with two branches) are <a id="l844"></a>alluded unto in the Apocalyps.   [And as the seven branches of the first golden <a id="l845"></a>candlestick are in this book called seven candlesticks, so the two branches of the second <a id="l846"></a>candlestick are here called two candlesticks] the name of candlestick which in <a id="l847"></a>old Testament is given to the stem with all its branches, being in this prophe<a id="l848"></a>sy given to each of the branches.</p>

<p id="par91">And the same thing is represented by the   son of man appearing <a id="l849"></a>in the beginning of the Prophesy with two flaming eyes,  &amp; two feet burning <a id="l850"></a>as it were in a furnace. His mystical body represents the church catholick &amp; his eyes <a id="l851"></a>leggs denote the division of this Church into two parts the Churches of the Greeks <a id="l852"></a>&amp; Latines the nations of the third &amp; fourth Empires.

<p id="par97">In the second Temple there was a candlestick with seven lamps whose form is thus described <a id="l900"></a>in the visions of Zechary ch. 4.   The  <a id="l901"></a>lamps were joyned to a golden bowle  by seven golden pipes through <a id="l902"></a>which the oyle ran into them, &amp; the bowle stood upon a golden candlestick <a id="l903"></a>&amp; was joyned (suppose with two branches to two vessels of oyle on either side by two golden pipes <a id="l904"></a>through which the oyle ran into it, &amp; the two vessels were supported by two <a id="l905"></a>Olive trees, not living trees growing upon a root &amp; flourishing with bran<a id="l906"></a>ches &amp; leaves, but shafts of  olive wood. These two olive trees are <a id="l907"></a>alluded unto in the Apocalyps &amp; instead of one golden candlestick to <a id="l908"></a>support the bowle with its seven lamps there are two suppose two branches from a common pedestal.. Now candlesticks <a id="l909"></a>signify Churches as above, &amp; so do olive trees Rom 11.17, 24. And since these <a id="l910"></a>two Candlesticks support the bowle all the seven lamps &amp; the two Olive branches supply them <a id="l911"></a>with oyle for illuminating the whole Temple of God they must represent the <a id="l912"></a> whole Church of God distinguished into  two Churches. And the same <a id="l913"></a>thing is signified by  the mystical body of Christ with  feet as pillars of fire. He has the book open in his hand to signify the times  which follow the opening of the seventh seale. He sets his right foot upon the sea &amp; his left foot <a id="l915"></a>upon the earth  to signify that he represents the the whole church  of God <a id="l916"></a>diffused through the earth &amp; sea. He stands in this posture all the time <a id="l917"></a>that he is prophesying concerning the  second Temple &amp; two <a id="l918"></a>witnesses &amp; therefore the two Witnesses represented by the two candlesticks <a id="l919"></a>&amp; two Olive trees  in this Temple are the true Church catholick of God composed of the Churches <a id="l920"></a>of the earth &amp; sea. This Temple with its Candlesticks appear not in the <a id="l921"></a> visions, the Angel only prophesies to Iohn concerning them without shew<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ing<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l922"></a>them to him.

And his  countenance being seen through <a id="l1329"></a>the bright flame of the Altar appeared  as the Sun shineth in <a id="l1330"></a>his strength &amp; his eyes like flames of fire &amp; his feet like amber <a id="l1331"></a>as if they burned in a furnace. The Lamps he dresses successively by declaring <span class="ns"></span> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 20v &gt; </span><span class="ns"></span> seven prophetic exhortations to the seven Angels of the Churches. For the seven <a id="l1332"></a>Angels  are represented by the seven stars &amp; seven <a id="l1333"></a>lamps  &amp; answer to the seven Amarcelim or chief Officers of the Temple.  For the seven Amacelim were Priests &amp; Officers of like &amp; equal honour &amp; <a id="l1335"></a>Authority, &amp; next in dignity to the High Priest &amp; his Deputies, &amp; had joyntly <a id="l1336"></a>the Keys of the seven Gates of the Temple, &amp;  those also of the Treasu<a id="l1337"></a>ries, &amp; the oversight,  direction &amp; appointment of all things in the Temple. And the seven <a id="l1338"></a>Angels were also chief Priests because they came out of the Temple <a id="l1339"></a>where none but chief Priests enter &amp; were cloathed in pure &amp; white <a id="l1340"></a>linnen &amp; had their breasts girded with golden girdles which is the Priests <a id="l1341"></a>habit, &amp; at seven sacrifices poured out seven Vials or drink offerings <a id="l1342"></a>&amp; sounded seven Trumpets. And as they are Priests, so they are said to <a id="l1343"></a>be before the Throne or Adytum of the Temple &amp; are considered in the Apo<a id="l1344"></a>calyps as next in dignity to the  great High Priest &amp; as having <a id="l1345"></a>the oversight of all things, being called the seven eyes of the Lamb <a id="l1346"></a>&amp; the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth, that is the <a id="l1347"></a>seven messengers  of God, &amp; the seven spirits before the throne <a id="l1348"></a>from whom &amp; the great High Priest &amp; God himself Iohn wishes grace &amp; peace to <a id="l1349"></a>the Churches. Angels signify messengers &amp; are put  in general for the Officers &amp; Ministers of the Temple &amp; by consequence the seven chief Angels for the seven chief Officers.</p>

<p id="par158"><em class="underline">After this</em>, saith Iohn <em class="underline">I looked &amp; behold a door</em> [the door of the <a id="l1350"></a>Temple not opening but already] <em class="underline">opened in heaven &amp; I heard <a id="l1351"></a>the first voice as the voice of a Trumpet talking with me &amp; <a id="l1352"></a>saying Come up hither</em>. This voice being the second sounding <a id="l1353"></a>of the Trumpet called the Prophet to see the solemnity of the <a id="l1354"></a>morning sacrifice. For the trumpets sounded every day thrice <a id="l1355"></a>first at the opening of the Gates of the Temple, then at the <a id="l1356"></a>morning &amp; lastly at the evening sacrifice. The Prophet therefore <a id="l1357"></a>being called up to the open door sees a <em class="underline">Throne</em>  set in heaven &amp; God <a id="l1358"></a>sitting thereon, that is  he sees the Adytum of the Temple &amp; God sitting therein above the Ark between <a id="l1359"></a>the Cherubims, &amp;  round <em class="underline">about the throne was a rainbow</em>, which imples that <a id="l1361"></a>the Sun was then in the East or that it was the time of morning <a id="l1362"></a>sacrifice.  And <em class="underline">about the throne were 24 seats &amp; upon them 24 Elders <a id="l1363"></a>in white raiment with crowns of gold upon their heads</em>.  These Elders are the Priests &amp; Levites  divided into 24 courses under 24 Princes who had 24 Chambers <a id="l1365"></a> about the Temple 12 on one side the Priests court &amp; <a id="l1366"></a>12 on the other side. Every elder comprehends in his mystical body the Prince Priests &amp; Levites of one course. For every single person in this Prophesy is put for a multitude.

Iohn standing at the eastern Gate  sees the flames <a id="l1368"></a>of the Altar  &amp; heares the  Temple-music like lightnings &amp; <a id="l1369"></a>thundrings &amp; voices proceeding out of the Throne. And there was the <a id="l1370"></a>golden candlestick with <em class="underline">seven lamps burning before the throne</em>, &amp; the brazen <em class="underline">sea</em>  <em class="underline">of glass</em> or water clear as <em class="underline">crystal</em>. <em class="underline">And in the midst of the throne &amp; circuit</em> <a id="l1372"></a> of <em class="underline">the throne</em> that is over against the midst of it  &amp; on either <a id="l1373"></a>hand <em class="underline">were four Beasts</em>  or Seraphims <em class="underline">full of eyes  before &amp; behind</em>, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021r"> &lt;21r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">&amp; also within</em> or under   their wings.  These Beast by their many eyes signify the <a id="l1374"></a>people of Israel in the four sides of the outward court of the temple <a id="l1375"></a>called the peoples Court. <em class="underline">And the first Beast was like a Lyon, the second <a id="l1376"></a>like a calf the third had the face of a man &amp; the fourth was like a flying <a id="l1377"></a>eagle.</em> The people in the Wilderness encamped round the Tabernacle. <a id="l1378"></a>On the east were thee Tribes under the standard of Iudah on the west were <a id="l1379"></a>three Tribes under the standard of Ephraim, on the south were three Tribes <a id="l1380"></a>under the standard of Reuben &amp; on the north were three tribes under the <a id="l1381"></a>standard of Dan. Num. 2. And the standard of Iudah was a Lyon that <a id="l1382"></a>of Ephraim  an Ox, that of Reuben a Man, &amp; that of Dan an Eagle <a id="l1383"></a>as the Iews affirm. Whence  were framed the Hieroglyphics of <a id="l1384"></a>Cherubims &amp; Seraphims ,   a Cherubim having  one body with the four faces of a Lyon, Ox, man <a id="l1385"></a>&amp; Eagle looking to the four winds of heaven without turning about, &amp; four <a id="l1386"></a>seraphims having the same four faces with four bodies, one face to every <a id="l1387"></a>body.  Conceive therefore that the first Beast stands on the <a id="l1388"></a>east side of the  Temple with the  head of a Lyon, the second on <a id="l1389"></a>the west side with the head of  a Calf, the third on the south <a id="l1390"></a>side with the head of a man &amp; the fourth on the north side with the <a id="l1391"></a>face of an Eagle. And that these four together signify all the twelve <a id="l1392"></a>tribes of Israel (those tribes out of which the hundred &amp; forty four thousand were sealed <a id="l1393"></a>Apoc  7.4) standing in the four sides of the outward court of  Solomons Temple which was the peoples Court while that Temple stood.  <em class="underline">And they had each of them six wings</em>, two wings to a Tribe, in all 24 wings or divisions according to the number of the elders. <em class="underline">And they rest not day &amp; night</em> <a id="l1396"></a>[that is morning &amp; evening at the sacrifices] <em class="underline">saying Holy, holy, holy <a id="l1397"></a>Lord God almighty.

At the <a id="l1399"></a>morning &amp; evening sacrifices so soon as the sacrifice was laid upon the Altar <a id="l1400"></a>&amp; the drink offering began to be poured out the trumpets sounded &amp; <a id="l1401"></a>the Levites sang by course three times &amp; every time  when the trumpets <a id="l1402"></a>sounded the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> people fell down &amp; worshipped.

<p id="par159"><em class="underline">And</em> Iohn <em class="underline">saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne <a id="l1416"></a>a book written within &amp; on the back side</em> [or on both sides of every leaf] <a id="l1417"></a><em class="underline">&amp; sealed with seven seales</em>.

<p id="par160">The affairs of the Greeks had three main periods of time <a id="l1434"></a>the first was under their own kings till they were conquered  <a id="l1435"></a> by the Romans, the second was under the <a id="l1436"></a>Romans till the division of the Roman Empire &amp; the third <a id="l1437"></a>was under their own kings reigning at Constantinople. And these <a id="l1438"></a>three periods  Daniel defines &amp; distinguishes by saying  at every period: <em class="underline">The end is yet at</em> [or after] <em class="underline">a time appointed.</em> First he describes the <a id="l1439"></a>affairs of the Greeks under their own kings very particularly <a id="l1440"></a>  by telling the  greatness <a id="l1441"></a>of the first king of Greece, the breaking of his kingdom in four great kingdoms but not to his <a id="l1442"></a>posterity &amp; by consequence after the  ceasing of his posterity,  the reduction of these four into two by <a id="l1443"></a>the king of the norths growing greater then the king of the south, <a id="l1444"></a>&amp; the  succession &amp; particular actions of the kings of the north &amp; south untill the <a id="l1445"></a> <a id="l1446"></a>last invasion of Egypt by Antiochus Epiphanes &amp; his indignation <a id="l1447"></a>against the holy covenant at his return to Syria. And there he puts an end to the first <a id="l1448"></a>period by saying that the hearts of both the  kings <em class="underline">shall be to do mischief</em> <a id="l1449"></a>[viz<sup>t</sup> against the holy covenant,] <em class="underline">but it shall not prosper: for yet the <a id="l1450"></a>end  shall be at the time appointed</em>. For in the very same year <a id="l1451"></a>that Antiochus  being checkt by the Roman Embassadors  returned the last time out of Egypt &amp; sent Appollonius with an  army against the Iews <a id="l1452"></a>&amp; set up the worship of the heathen Gods in the Temple &amp; throughout <a id="l1453"></a>all Iudea, the Romans conquered Perseus king of Macedon &amp; Gentius king of Illyricum &amp; reduced <a id="l1454"></a>the kingdoms of Macedon &amp;  Illyricum into  Provinces. And therefore Daniel prosecutes <a id="l1455"></a>the history of the kings of the north &amp; south no farther then <a id="l1456"></a>to that year, but  there <a id="l1457"></a> breaks of &amp; begins to describe the rise of the dominion of the <a id="l1458"></a>Romans over the Greeks in these words. <em class="underline">And after him arms <a id="l1459"></a>shall stand up</em>. &amp;c  , // For these words import that after Antiochus a new dominion <a id="l1460"></a>shall stand up over the  kingdoms of the north &amp; south.. For Daniel every where uses <a id="l1461"></a>the word <em class="underline">Arms</em> for the military power &amp; strength of a kingdom, &amp; as he <a id="l1462"></a>uses ממלה <em class="underline">a  rege</em> to signify  <em class="underline">post regem</em> after <a id="l1463"></a>the king (Dan XI. <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) so here he uses ממבו ab illo  to signify <a id="l1464"></a> <a id="l1465"></a><em class="underline">post illum</em>, after  him, that is, after Antiochus. <a id="l1466"></a>Daniel had mentioned the Romans in this Prophesy  twice before upon less occasions <a id="l1467"></a>&amp; therefore we need not wonder if he mentions them now upon <a id="l1468"></a>their conquering  first the kingdom of Macedon &amp; soon after the rest of the <a id="l1469"></a>kingdoms of the Greeks.  for under the short words: <em class="underline">And after him</em> <a id="l1470"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="8 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="hspac-n" title="10 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <a id="l1471"></a><em class="underline">arms shall stand up</em>  is comprehended the standing up of the <a id="l1472"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="11 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="hspac-n" title="15 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <a id="l1473"></a>Romans arms over   the  kingdoms of the north &amp; south <a id="l1475"></a> of which Daniel had been hitherto speaking.  &amp; by consequence over all the kingdoms of the Greeks. So soon as they stood up they were to  pollute the sanctuary of strength, &amp; could not do that till they stood up over  Phœnicia. They stood up first over Macedon, then over Achaia, then over  Asia <a id="l1476"></a>by the legacy of Attalus, then over Syria &amp; Phœnicia by the victories of Lucullus <a id="l1477"></a>&amp; Pompey &amp; lastly over Egypt by the victories of Augustus. And the <a id="l1478"></a>next thing of consequence done by the Romans was to make war upon the Iews, burn their <a id="l1479"></a>Temple  place the heathen Gods in all <a id="l1480"></a>the cities of Iudea,  &amp; disperse the people into all nations  All which <a id="l1482"></a>is exprest by Daniel in these words <em class="underline">And they shall pollute the Sanctuary of strength</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023r"> &lt;23r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">and take away the daily</em> [sacrifice] <em class="underline">&amp; place the abomination which maketh <a id="l1483"></a>desolate</em>. The attempt of Antiochus did not prosper. In his days the <a id="l1484"></a>land was not made desolate: but the abomination placed by the Romans <a id="l1485"></a>was accompanied with a desolation of the land &amp; dispersion of the Iews <a id="l1486"></a>into all nations as at this day, &amp; therefore was the abomination of <a id="l1487"></a>desolation spoken of by the Prophet Daniel.   as Christ himself has also <a id="l1488"></a>interpreted in Matt. XXIV. 15,16. </p>
<p id="par161">When the Romans made war upon the Iews they looked <a id="l1489"></a>upon  all the Iews as their enemies &amp; upon the Christian <a id="l1490"></a>gentiles as friends to the Christian Iews &amp; from that time began to afflict <a id="l1491"></a>&amp; persecute the Christians,  &amp; continued to do so from time to time untill <a id="l1492"></a>the conversion of the Empire to Christianity in the reign of Constantine <a id="l1493"></a>&amp; his sons,  whereby great numbers of heathens out of temporal ends <a id="l1494"></a>flowed into the Christian Churches making an outward profession of Christianity <a id="l1495"></a>without mending their lives,  as Daniel thus describes. <em class="underline"> And <a id="l1496"></a>such as do wickedly against the covenant he shall corrupt by flatteries</em> [causing <a id="l1497"></a>them to fall away by fair promises] <em class="underline">but the people that do know their God <a id="l1498"></a>shall be strong &amp; act. And they that understand among the people</em> [the Apostles <a id="l1499"></a>&amp;  primitive teachers] <em class="underline">shall instruct <a id="l1500"></a>many: yet they shall fall by the sword &amp; by flame by captivity &amp; by <a id="l1501"></a>spoile many days. And when they shall fall they shall be holpen with <a id="l1502"></a>a little help</em> [by the conversion of the Empire to Christianity:] <em class="underline">but many</em> <a id="l1503"></a>[hypocrites] <em class="underline">shall cleave to them with flatteries</em> [or dissembling speeches.] <em class="underline">And of those of understanding there <a id="l1504"></a>shall fall to try</em> [&amp; distinguish] <em class="underline">them &amp; to purge</em> [&amp; separate them from the multitude of <a id="l1505"></a>  flatterers] <em class="underline">&amp; to make them white, even to the time of the <a id="l1506"></a>end because it is yet for a time appointed</em>. Here daniel places the second <a id="l1507"></a>period of the affairs of the Greeks.   viz<sup>t</sup> at that  point of time <a id="l1508"></a>when the Christian Churches were filled full of flatterers &amp; the sincere <a id="l1509"></a>part of the Christians by opposing the heathen superstitions &amp; wicked practices <a id="l1510"></a>of the flatterers fell into new troubles  which lasted till the time of <a id="l1511"></a>the end. At that time therefore the affairs of the Greeks suffered a new great <a id="l1512"></a>change. And this change was the separation of the Greeks from the Latines <a id="l1513"></a>&amp; their erecting a new Empire at Constantinople &amp; henceforward <a id="l1514"></a>reigning there apart. For this was the next great change which happened <a id="l1515"></a>to the Greeks, &amp; Daniel  in the next words thus describes the rise &amp; reign <a id="l1516"></a>of this Empire. </p>
<p id="par162"><em class="underline">And a king shall do according to his will</em> [that is a new king or kingdom <a id="l1517"></a>shall  stand up over the Greeks,  a kingdom of the flatterers under <a id="l1518"></a>whom those of understand  are to fall <a id="l1519"></a>He shall not do according to the will of God but according to his own will] <a id="l1520"></a><em class="underline">&amp; he shall exalt himself &amp; magnify himself above every God, &amp; shall <a id="l1521"></a>speak marvellous things against the God of Gods, &amp; shall prosper till <a id="l1522"></a>the indignation</em> [against the holy covenant] <em class="underline">be accomplished</em>: for that that is <a id="l1523"></a><em class="underline">determined shall be done</em>. <em class="underline"> And he shall  not regard the God of his <a id="l1524"></a>fathers nor the desire of weomen</em> [in lawfull matrimony]  <em class="underline">nor  shall he regard any <a id="l1525"></a>God,  for he shall magnify himself above all</em>. <em class="underline">And</em>  <a id="l1526"></a><em class="underline">together with God he shall honour Mahuzzims</em> [or Guardians] <em class="underline">in his seat even together with the God whom his fathers <a id="l1527"></a>knew not shall he honour</em> [them] <em class="underline">with gold &amp; silver &amp; with pretious stones &amp; <a id="l1528"></a> with things of value</em>.

Prophesy is of things future &amp; therefore this prophesy of the eighth leafe <a id="l1567"></a>begins with his ascent  out of the abyss [&amp; lasts untill he goes into per<a id="l1568"></a>dition.] And since he ascends out of the abyss or sea he is that Beast which kills the <a id="l1569"></a>two Witnesses in the sreets of the great city Babylon which for its uncleaneness,  idola<a id="l1570"></a>try &amp; cruelty to Gods people is called Sodom &amp; Egypt.  He ascends out of the abyss <a id="l1571"></a>or sea with seven heads &amp; ten horns &amp; upon his heads the names of blas<a id="l1572"></a>phemy, &amp; in one of his heads a mortal wound. For all the world wonder after <a id="l1573"></a>both these beasts &amp; both of them continue to the end, the first being worshipped till <a id="l1574"></a>the time of the great harvest &amp; vintage the other being cast alive into the lake of fire] He <a id="l1575"></a>was  before he was wounded to death with a sword. He is not while he lies dead <a id="l1576"></a>of his wound, &amp; after  he revives he ascends out of the abyss or sea &amp; goes <a id="l1577"></a>into perdition  in the lake of fire His heads are called <a id="l1578"></a> seven kings. Five of them  fell before he  was slain &amp; ceased to <a id="l1579"></a>be, one of them was when he lay dead of his wound,  &amp; the seventh was <a id="l1580"></a>not then come &amp; therefore the mortal wound of the Beast was in his sixt head.  One side <a id="l1581"></a>of his head was not chopt off, but   the wound  was in his head; &amp; therefore he revived be<a id="l1582"></a>fore the time of his sixt head expired. He revived before he ascended out of the sea <a id="l1583"></a>&amp; ascended out of the sea before the Dragon gave him his throne. His ascent out <a id="l1584"></a>of the sea begins a seventh head &amp; his receiving the throne of the Dragon an eighth <a id="l1585"></a>For the beast  which was &amp; is not he is the eighth &amp; of the seven that is the latter <a id="l1586"></a>part of the seventh. Conceive the heads to be seven successive reigns  <a id="l1587"></a>beginning at the opening of the seven seales as was said of the heads of the Dragon <a id="l1588"></a>&amp; that the seventh head begins at the openong of the seventh seale &amp; the eighth  <a id="l1589"></a> when the seven Angels which had the seven Trumpets <a id="l1590"></a>prepared themselves to sound,  or just before the first Angel sounded. For this period is the most <a id="l1591"></a>remarkable division of the time of the seventh  seale into two successive parts.  <a id="l1592"></a>[In the prophesy of the Whore of Babylon sitting on a scarlet coloured Beast the first thing <a id="l1593"></a>spoken of as future is the ascent of the Beast out of the abyss &amp; the coming of his seventh <a id="l1594"></a>head &amp; this being at the opening of the seventh seale, this prophesy  begins at the open<a id="l1595"></a>ing of that seal. It continues till] At length the ten kings represented by the horns of the Beast <a id="l1596"></a>hate the Whore &amp; eat her flesh &amp; burn her with fire, &amp;   soon after the Word of God comes <a id="l1597"></a>with his army  on white horses &amp; the Beast &amp; kings of the earth &amp; their armies are <a id="l1598"></a>gathered together to make war against him &amp; his army &amp;  inthe battel between them the Beast &amp; fals Prophet <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024v"> &lt;24v&gt; </span> are taken &amp; cast alive into the lake of fire &amp; the rest are slain with the two edged sword  &amp; the Dragon is shut up in the bottomless pit.

<p id="par164">At the sounding of the fift Trumpet the bottomless pit was opened with a key <a id="l1605"></a>to let out a false religion.

<h2 id="hd10" class="left">The Dragon &amp; Beast have common heads &amp; horns</h2>
<p id="par171">While The Greeks &amp; Latines    remained united  in one monarchy  under one imperial city – which happened during the reign <a id="l1656"></a>of the Heathen  Emperors, the whole Empire   is represented by the Dragon; &amp; the Beast is  latent virtually in him : For he is the Flood which upon the division of the Empire, the Dragon <a id="l1658"></a>cast out of his mouth.  And  to signify this union the Dragon &amp; Beast have common heads &amp; horns: but the Dragon has <a id="l1660"></a> seven crowns upon his heads to shew that he reigns in the heads during the union &amp; the Beast has ten crowns <a id="l1661"></a>upon his horns to shew that he reigns in the horns after the division. For five of the heads were fallen  <a id="l1662"></a>&amp; the sixt was in being before the Beast ascended out of the abyss &amp; before the ten horns received power as kings  &amp; the 7<sup>th</sup> head began his reign before the Beast received the throne of the Dragon, because he is called the eighth. When the Dragon cast down out of his mouth water as a flood, the Empire became divided &amp; when the earth opened. <a id="l1663"></a>her mouth &amp; swallowed up the flood  the  empire became reunited &amp; the beast <a id="l1664"></a>was slain by a wound with a sword &amp; ceased for a time being reunited to the Dragon by the victory of the earth, &amp; at the next divisions of the Empire <a id="l1665"></a>the deadly wound was healed &amp; the Beast revived &amp; rose out of the sea &amp; received the Dragons throne, &amp; soon <a id="l1666"></a>after became divided into ten kingdoms which are his ten horns. The foundation of the <a id="l1667"></a>division of the Roman Empire into the Greek &amp; Latine Empires was the building of Constantinople by <a id="l1668"></a>Constantine the great. Before the building of this city Rome was the Metropolis of the whole, after <a id="l1669"></a>the building of it Rome was the Metropolis of the western nations &amp; Constantinople of the eastern. <a id="l1670"></a>Constane left the Empire divided between his sons  Constantine <a id="l1671"></a>Constantius &amp; Constans.  Constantine was soon slain Constantius reigned at Constantinople over the east &amp; <a id="l1673"></a>Constans &amp; after him Magnentius at Rome over the west. Constantius overcame Magnentius &amp; <a id="l1674"></a>reunited the Empire,  &amp; was succeed by Iulian &amp; Iovian.  After their reign the empire became <a id="l1675"></a>divided again between  the brothers Valentinian &amp; Valens &amp; thus the deadly wound was healed <a id="l1676"></a>&amp; the Beast revived. After the death of Valens the whole Empire  united  under Gratian <a id="l1677"></a>for about five months &amp; then became divided again  between Gratian &amp; Theodosius &amp; <a id="l1678"></a> by this division the Beast rose out of the Sea.  Theodosius reigned in the east &amp; three months before his death conquered <a id="l1679"></a> the western Emperor Eugenius &amp;  by his last will &amp; testament <a id="l1680"></a>A.C. 395 left the Empire divided between his two sons Arcadius &amp; Honorius giving the western empire <a id="l1681"></a>to his younger son Honorius.  This was the last division of the Empire &amp; therefore  <a id="l1682"></a>it was at this time that the Dragon gave the Beast his oldthrone. And soon after,  viz<sup>t</sup> A.C. <a id="l1683"></a>408,  the western Empire became divided at once (as has been explained above into ten kingdoms; of which its said <a id="l1684"></a><em class="underline">The ten horns are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet but receive power <a id="l1685"></a>as kings at one</em> &amp; the same  <em class="underline">hour</em> or time <em class="underline">with the Beast</em>.  That is, nine of their <a id="l1686"></a>  kingdoms are rent away from the   Beast &amp; the remaining part of the Beast is the tenth  <a id="l1687"></a> <em class="underline">These have one mind &amp; shall give their power &amp; strength &amp; kingdom unto <a id="l1688"></a>the Beast</em>,  that is is to compose his body As he was divided into these ten   <a id="l1689"></a> &amp; They are parts of his body  so they agree &amp; by their unamity compose a body politique or kingdom which is  still called the Beast. <a id="l1690"></a>And the<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>o<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> these kings may have since been more or fewer then ten yet they keep the <a id="l1691"></a>name of the ten kingdoms from their first number. And so the eastern nations which <a id="l1692"></a>at the first division of the Empire into the Eastern &amp; Western Empires composed the Eastern or Greek empire signified by the Dragon are still the <a id="l1693"></a>Dragon notwithstanding that some of then have been since conquered by the Saracens &amp; all of <a id="l1694"></a>them by the Turks. For as Daniels Beasts had their lives prolonged after their <a id="l1695"></a>dominions were taken away &amp; are all of them still in being so it is to be un<a id="l1696"></a>derstood of Iohns Dragon &amp; Beast. Those nations which composed their bodies <a id="l1697"></a>at the first division of Roman Empire into the Greek &amp; Latine Empires <a id="l1698"></a>do still compose their bodies notwithstanding the changes which they have suffer<a id="l1699"></a>ed in their dominion.</p>

But upon the divisions <a id="l1702"></a>of the Empire, as the Dragon retires into the Eastern Empire &amp; leaves the western to the tenhorned <a id="l1703"></a>Beast who then rises out of the  sea, so the Woman retires into the western Empire &amp; leaves the <a id="l1704"></a>eastern to the two horned Beast who then rises out of the earth. And this her retiring is represented <a id="l1705"></a>by her flying into a spiritually barren wilderness &amp; there getting upon the Beast &amp; committing fornication <a id="l1706"></a>with the ten kings represented by his horns. And when this Beast rises out of the sea the second <a id="l1707"></a>temple  appears &amp; is measured with them that worship therein to represent that part <a id="l1708"></a>of Gods people who live within his kingdom &amp; in this temple are two Candlesticks to represent <a id="l1709"></a>the two witnesses whom the Beast makes war upon &amp; kills in the streets of the great city <a id="l1710"></a>Babylon as the Dragon makes war upon the remnant of the womans seed left in <a id="l1711"></a>his kingdom &amp; represented by the remnant of the seven  Churches of Asia   or seven <a id="l1712"></a>Candlesticks in the  first Temple.

The  first four Dynasties were Mo<a id="l1728"></a>narchical this is  several Emperors reigning together &amp;  sharing the Empire between <a id="l1729"></a>them by consent. It began with the reign of Dioclesian &amp; his colleagues &amp; lasted till Constantine <a id="l1730"></a>by conquering Licinius reduced  the Empire back into a monarchical form as was said above. It is  also <a id="l1731"></a>distinguished from the former persecutions by the Æra of the Empire  dated from its <a id="l1732"></a>beginning &amp; called the Æra of Dioclesian &amp; the Æra of the martyrs.

In the beginning of <a id="l1775"></a>the former Prophesy Iohn saw a door opened in heaven, here he <a id="l1776"></a>sees the Temple of God opened in heaven: there he saw a throne  set in heaven &amp; <a id="l1777"></a>God sitting upon it, here he sees  in <a id="l1778"></a>the Temple the Ark of the Testament which is Gods throne.</p>
<p id="par177"><em class="underline">And there were lightnings &amp; voices &amp; thunderings &amp; an <a id="l1779"></a>earthquake &amp; great hail</em>. that is, great wars made by the <a id="l1780"></a>four horsmen at the opening of the first four seales.</p>
<p id="par178"><em class="underline">And there appeared a great wonder in</em> [the Temple of] <em class="underline">heaven, a Woman <a id="l1781"></a>cloathed with the Sun &amp;c And she being with child cried, travelling <a id="l1782"></a>in birth &amp; pained to be delivered</em>. At the opening of the fift <a id="l1783"></a>seal the Church of Christ which is this woman was in pain by <a id="l1784"></a>Dioclesians persecution for ten years together.</p>
<p id="par179"><em class="underline">And there appeared another wonder in</em> [the Temple of] <em class="underline">heaven &amp; behold a <a id="l1785"></a>great red Dragon having seven heads &amp; ten horns &amp; seven <a id="l1786"></a>crowns upon his heads</em>. The Roman Empire distinguished into <a id="l1787"></a>seven capital successive  reigns or Dynasties  <a id="l1788"></a> by the opening of the seven seals, the four first <a id="l1789"></a>of which heads are represented by the four horsmen or Kings  <a id="l1790"></a>which appeare at the opening of the first four heads of the Beast <a id="l1791"></a>are called seven Kings &amp; described to be successive by saying <a id="l1792"></a><em class="underline">five are fallen &amp; one is &amp; the other is not yet come.</em> Apoc. 17. <a id="l1793"></a>The ten horns are the ten kingdoms into which the western Em<a id="l1794"></a>pire became divided A.C. 408. The Dragon has crowns upon <a id="l1795"></a>his heads &amp; the Beast upon his horns to signify that the Dragon <a id="l1796"></a>is here considered in the reign of the heads &amp; the Beast after<a id="l1797"></a>wards in the reign of the horns.</p>
<p id="par180"><em class="underline">And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven <a id="l1798"></a>&amp; did cast them to the earth</em>. As the little horn of Daniels <a id="l1799"></a>He Goat waxed great to the very host of heaven &amp; cast down <a id="l1800"></a>of the Host &amp; of the stars to the grownd &amp; stamped upon them so <a id="l1801"></a>the tail of the Dragon, which is his army, casts down the <a id="l1802"></a>saints of the eastern Empire in Dioclesians persecution.</p>
<p id="par181"><em class="underline">And the Dragon stood before the woman which was ready <a id="l1803"></a>to be delivered for to devour her child so soon as it was born <a id="l1804"></a>And the woman brought forth a man child who was to rule <a id="l1805"></a>all nations with a rod of iron</em> <em class="underline">&amp; the child was caught up to God &amp; to his Throne</em>, that is, up to the Ark where God was represented sitting between the wings of the Cherubims. In the last year of the per<a id="l1806"></a>secution Constantine the great was converted to Christianity, <a id="l1807"></a>overcame Maxentius &amp; became Emperor of the west &amp; con<a id="l1808"></a>tracting affinity with Licinius they wrote to Maximinus to <a id="l1809"></a>stop the persecution in the east. Thus the woman brought <a id="l1810"></a>forth a manchild &amp; at his birth her pains ceased. By the <a id="l1811"></a>man-child understand not a single person but a Christian <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027r"> &lt;27r&gt; </span> kingdom. So Isaiah:<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> <em class="underline">Before her pain came she was delivered of a <a id="l1812"></a>man-child. Who hath heard such things? shall a nation be born <a id="l1813"></a>at once? For as soon as Zion travailed she brought forth her chil<a id="l1814"></a>dren</em>.  After seven or eight years Licinius began to <a id="l1815"></a>renew the persecution in the East, &amp; thereupon Constantine the great <a id="l1816"></a>made war upon him &amp; overcame him &amp; by this victory the Man-child <a id="l1817"></a>was caught up to God &amp; to his throne, the throne of the whole Empire <a id="l1818"></a>&amp; thereby delivered from the Dragon who stood ready to devour him. <a id="l1819"></a>This was at the opening of the sixt seal.</p>
<p id="par182"><em class="underline">And the woman fled into the wilderness</em>  [a country barren of those who keep the commandments <a id="l1821"></a>of Iesus: the western Empire whose metropolis Rome  is <a id="l1822"></a>the mystical Babylon] where she hath a place [a dignity &amp; dominion] <a id="l1823"></a>prepared for her that they [the merchants of the earth] should feed <a id="l1824"></a>her there [with their merchandise of Gold &amp; silver &amp; Gemms &amp; costly apparel <a id="l1825"></a>&amp; all manner of vessels &amp; spices &amp; odours &amp; oyntments &amp; wine &amp; oyle &amp; wheat <a id="l1826"></a>&amp; beasts  &amp; sheep &amp; chariots &amp; bodies &amp; souls of men &amp; that she <a id="l1827"></a>should  live deliciously with the kings of the earth] a thousand two <a id="l1828"></a>hundred &amp; threescore [prophetic] days.</p>
<p id="par183">But before she fled into the wilderness, at the same time that the <a id="l1829"></a>manchild was caught up to  God &amp; to his throne, the Dragon was cast <a id="l1830"></a>out of heaven. For at the opening of the sixt seal, <em class="underline">there was war <a id="l1831"></a>in heaven; Michael &amp; his Angels fought against the Dragon &amp; the Dragon <a id="l1832"></a>fought &amp; his Angels, &amp; prevailed not; neither was their place</em> [i.e. their <a id="l1833"></a>dignity &amp;  power] <em class="underline">found any more in  heaven</em>. <em class="underline">And the great Dragon was cast out that old Serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan who deceiveth the whole world he was cast out</em> [from the Temple of heaven or upper Court] <em class="underline">into the earth</em> [or outward Court] <em class="underline">&amp; his Angels were cast out with him</em> As the Angel told <a id="l1834"></a>Daniel that Micahel assisted him against the Prince  or Angel <a id="l1835"></a>of the kingdom of Persia &amp; that he had assisted Darius &amp; went forth <a id="l1836"></a>to fight with the king of Persia &amp; that Michael the great Prince <a id="l1837"></a>standeth for the children of Israel (Dan. 10 &amp; 12) so in the Apocalyps <a id="l1838"></a>Michael is represented as standing up  for Constantine &amp; the <a id="l1839"></a>Christians against Licinius whose kingdom is the  heathen Empire <a id="l1840"></a>assisted by the Dragon that old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan who <a id="l1841"></a>deceiveth the whole world. And by the victory of Michael the man child <a id="l1842"></a>was caught up to God &amp; to his throne &amp; the Dragon was cast out &amp; <a id="l1843"></a>his kingdome ruined as is fully exprest at  the opening of the sixt <a id="l1844"></a>seal by the earthquake &amp; smiting of the sun Moon &amp; stars &amp; departing of the <a id="l1845"></a>heavens Mountains &amp; Islands &amp; all men hiding themselves from the wrath <a id="l1846"></a>of the Conquerors God &amp; the Lamb, which Lamb is here represented by <a id="l1847"></a>Michael who gets the victory</p>
<p id="par184"><em class="underline">And Iohn heard a loud voice  saying in heaven, Now <a id="l1848"></a>is come salvation &amp; strength  &amp; the KINGDOM of our God &amp; the <a id="l1849"></a>power of his Christ, for the accuser</em> [or persecutor] <em class="underline">of our brethren <a id="l1850"></a>is cast out who accused them before our God day &amp; night.

<p id="par215" class="i0">When God first appeared to Ezekiel &amp; sent him  with general commission to prophesy,  against Israel he gave <a id="l3296"></a>him this book to eat in token of his commission &amp; therefore it respects the <a id="l3297"></a>manner the book which Iohn ate  must respect all  his prophesying  to the end of the Apocalyps. The Prophet <a id="l3299"></a>ate the whole book &amp; therefore is to prophesy again of the whole, &amp; <a id="l3300"></a>that more openly then before because the book was now opened &amp; nothing <a id="l3301"></a>had been hitherto prophesied out of it as open but what the Prophet was <a id="l3302"></a>commanded to seal up. When Ezekiel had eaten  the book  it was  sweet in his mouth as honey, but after <a id="l3304"></a>the  spirit had discoursed with him a while about his pro<a id="l3305"></a>phesying,  &amp; then sent him away to the people to prophesy  he went away in bitter<a id="l3306"></a>ness  &amp; heat of spirit &amp; so Iohn found the  little book sweet in his <a id="l3307"></a>mouth but afterwards bitter in his belly: sweet while the Angel discoursed <a id="l3308"></a>to him about the things he should prophesy of but bitter when the Angels <a id="l3309"></a>dismist him to prophesy.  The sweetness  being contrary to the <a id="l3310"></a> mournings lamentations &amp; wo   of which the book  was full, <a id="l3311"></a>signifies that the contents of the book did not immediately affect either Ezekiel <a id="l3312"></a>or Iohn. Some time was to be allowed for the book to be eaten &amp; digested before <a id="l3313"></a>it began to operate &amp; therefore the Angel does not stay till the prophesy <a id="l3314"></a>of the Trumpets be ended but for the decorum of the type gives him the <a id="l3315"></a>book to eat a little before  the end of that prophesy so  that  he may have time to digest it &amp; be ready to prophesy <a id="l3316"></a> again so soon as the first prophesy shal be ended. So then while <a id="l3317"></a>the  sweetness continues in the prophets mouth &amp; the book is not yet <a id="l3318"></a>digested, the Angel discourses to him about the contents thereof, the temple <a id="l3319"></a>  &amp; holy. City  two witnesses &amp; the great City &amp; Beast, &amp; then the sounding <a id="l3320"></a>of the seventh trumpet puts an end to the first Prophesy &amp; the Angel <a id="l3321"></a>leaves the Prophet to prophesy again of thos</p>
<p id="par216">So then the  things discoursed of by the Angel are  the things of <a id="l3323"></a>which the Prophet was to prophesy again &amp; by consequence of which he had <a id="l3324"></a>been prophesying already, &amp; therefore  this prophesy of the Angel  is collateral &amp; contemporary to the prophesies which both precede &amp; follow. And so far <a id="l3326"></a>as it is a description of the things of which the Prophet was to prophesy by<a id="l3327"></a> vertue of the eaten book &amp; those things are an interpreta<a id="l3328"></a>tion of the first prophesy, this  of the Angel  may also to be accounted <a id="l3329"></a>an interpretation of  so much of the first prophe<a id="l3330"></a>sy as preceded it  &amp; is contemporary to  the times of the <a id="l3331"></a>prophesying Angel that is to the times of the open book &amp; seven thunders. <a id="l3332"></a>&amp; by consequence to the times which follow the opening of the last seal &amp; fall in with the Trumpets. For it is improper to make the Angel discourse as a prophet <a id="l3333"></a>concerning things which precede the time of his first appearing   to prophesy. </p>

<p id="par218">Now because these times began with  numbering &amp; sealing the <a id="l3336"></a>  servants of God out of the 12 Tribes &amp; leaving the rest of the Tribes unsealed &amp; with offering incense with the prayers of the saints in the temple – on the day of expiation, <a id="l3337"></a>the Angel begins his prophetic discourse with measuring the temple &amp; altar <a id="l3338"></a>&amp; them that worship therein, &amp; leaving  the outward court unmeasured <a id="l3339"></a>for the nations to worship in. For these things have a peculiar relation  &amp; interpret one another <a id="l3340"></a>the measuring the Temple &amp; them that worship therein signifying the same thing <a id="l3341"></a>with numbering &amp; sealing them whose prayers were offered up with incense on <a id="l3342"></a>the  golden Altar: &amp; the omitting to seale &amp;  number the rest of </p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p042v"> &lt;42v&gt; </span>

<p id="par220" class="i0"> the tribes the same thing with omitting to measure the outward Court <a id="l3347"></a>which was given to the Nations. For the twelve tribes are  the <a id="l3348"></a>Christian nations  whereof the true &amp; sincere Christians are number<a id="l3349"></a>ed sealed &amp; measured &amp; the rest with their outward court neglected. <a id="l3350"></a>So then this prophesy of the Angel begins with the opening of the <a id="l3351"></a>seventh seal &amp;  therefore since it ends with the <a id="l3352"></a>sounding of the seventh Trumpet it respects all the  times of <a id="l3353"></a>Trumpets.</p>
<p id="par221">And that this is so will further appear from the Constitution of the <a id="l3354"></a>Temple. For the  sanctuary with which the Prophesy  began <a id="l3355"></a>was either  the Tabernacle or Ark within it &amp; by the four Beasts worshipping in the <a id="l3356"></a>four sides of the outward court, there being in the second temple no Ark nor     worshipping Israelites in the outward court, as you will understand by <a id="l3359"></a>this following history of the Temple. The Iews at their return <a id="l3360"></a>from captivity were but few – – – –</p>
<p id="par222">– – – – &amp; remained unbuilt &amp; open to the gentiles: &amp; the Gentiles <a id="l3361"></a>to whom the outward court is given &amp; who tread under foot the <a id="l3362"></a> holy City allude to the Babylonians who captivated Ierusalem <a id="l3363"></a>&amp; kept possession of the outward court  after  the <a id="l3364"></a>inward  court by the permission of Cyrus was rebuilt for the Iews. So <a id="l3365"></a>then the  Angels prophesy  concerning the measured  Temple <a id="l3366"></a> &amp; holy city begins  not with the Tabernacle or first Temple as the prophesy of the sealed book did, but with the Babylonian captivity &amp; <a id="l3369"></a>second Temple; that is, with the desolation  &amp; captivity of the holy Church <a id="l3370"></a>by the  great city Babylon (as the  nations which  tread under foot <a id="l3371"></a> the holy city are afterwards called,) &amp; with <a id="l3372"></a>the measuring &amp; building up the elect a spiritual house an holy Priesthood to offer <a id="l3373"></a>up sacrifices to God by Iesus Christ (as Peter expresses it) while the <a id="l3374"></a>outward court of the unholy nations lies spiritually unmeasured &amp; unbuilt. <a id="l3375"></a>And this consideration perfectly fixes the time of this prophesy in respect <a id="l3376"></a>of the prophesies which both precede &amp; follow.</p>
<p id="par223">For in the prophesies which precede, the sealing of the servants <a id="l3377"></a>of God alludes to Ezekiels vision of sealing or marking the best <a id="l3378"></a>of the people in their foreheads in the commencing Babylonian captivity <a id="l3379"></a>to be preserved &amp; continue the remnant of Gods Church in the <a id="l3380"></a>times of the second Temple &amp; therefore the sealed live in the <a id="l3381"></a>times of that  Temple &amp; of the holy Cities being troden under foot <a id="l3382"></a>by the Babylonian nations; &amp; their sealing as well as the measuring <a id="l3383"></a>of the Temple commences with the Babylonian captivity. For <a id="l3384"></a>seing the Church never ceases but is built up in a new form &amp; <a id="l3385"></a>state so soon as demolished in an old one, the interval between <a id="l3386"></a>the fall of the first  Temple &amp; building of the second is not <a id="l3387"></a>here to be considered.</p>

<p id="par226">The son of man amongst the Candlesticks alludes to the High Priest trimming the <a id="l3399"></a>Lamps.

<p id="par227">The lamps being trimmed there follows the morning sacrifice &amp; worship by <a id="l3402"></a>the general assembly in the temple chap 4 &amp; 5. Then an allusion in the seals to the High Priests <a id="l3403"></a>opening &amp; reading the law seven days before feast of Tabernacles chap 6  Then  <a id="l3404"></a>a description of the people who celebrate the feast of Tabernacles viz<sup>t</sup> first of <a id="l3405"></a>those who put on their phylacteries (the seale of God in their foreheads) in the morning <a id="l3406"></a>of the fast on the 10<sup>th</sup> day &amp; afterwards of the Palm bearing multitude. Then is <a id="l3407"></a>the fast day alluded to in silence during the high Priests offering incense on the <a id="l3408"></a>golden alter with the peoples prayers, then casting fire to the earth that is cleansing the alter to sprinkle it. Then <a id="l3409"></a>  sound the trumpets at the sacrifices of the seven days of the feast. To the same sacrifices allude the 7 vials as being their libamina These <a id="l3410"></a>are the main allusions to the law. Hence Christians are called Iews &amp; Apostates the <a id="l3411"></a>synagoge  of Satan, that is members of the Dragon.</p>
<p id="par228">To the history of the Iews there is this allusion. The Woman Israel <a id="l3412"></a>Ægypt under the persecuting Dragon bears the manchild Moses with his rod <a id="l3413"></a> Moses is caught up to Gods throne (dominion over the Iews) Michael &amp; the Dragon contend much in Ægypt &amp; the woman flys into <a id="l3414"></a>the Wilderness.

<p id="par229">Another allusion there is to  Babylon. This being a very great <a id="l3424"></a>&amp; idolatrous city &amp; reigning over many kingdoms, captivated &amp; afflicted the <a id="l3425"></a>people of God extreamly. Vnder her were the temple &amp; inner court granted <a id="l3426"></a>to the people of God to worship in but the outward court  which before the <a id="l3427"></a>captivity had been the court of the people was given to the gentiles &amp; thence <a id="l3428"></a>got the name of the gentiles court. Measuring the Temple &amp; Altar is a type of <a id="l3429"></a>building &amp; alludes to the building of the  inner Temple under Babylon <a id="l3430"></a>in the 2<sup>d</sup> yeare  of Darius: at which time the two Prophets Haggai &amp; <a id="l3431"></a>Zechary prophesied together Hag. 1.1. Zech 1.1, &amp; the two olive trees <a id="l3432"></a>appeared in a vision to Zechary Zech 4.3, 12, 14. In allusion also to  <a id="l3433"></a>the Apostacy of Israel under Iezebel, the whore of Babylon is called Iezebel <a id="l3434"></a>Apoc 2 &amp;   the acts of Elijah of devouring their enemies by fire, of shutting <a id="l3435"></a>up heaven that it rain not, &amp; of ascending up to heaven in a cloud ascribed to the two <a id="l3436"></a>witnesses. And these are the main allusions to the Iewish church &amp; history.</p>
<p id="par230">The plague of the first Trumpet falls on green things  as if the Beast were not yet fully in the wilderness with the woman. In the fift green things are not hurt but only the men which <a id="l3438"></a>have not the mark of God in their foreheads that is on  those who have the mark <a id="l3439"></a>of the Beast &amp; consequently are in the wilderness. As a natural wilderness is naturally <a id="l3440"></a>barren so a spiritual wilderness is spiritually barren. And to signify this the<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>y<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p044v"> &lt;44v&gt; </span>there are opposed to green things. Wherefore the woman flying into the wilder<a id="l3441"></a>ness becomes spiritually barren, &amp; consequently a degenerate church &amp; whore of <a id="l3442"></a>Babylon. The church of the Iews fleing into the wilderness worshipped the calf &amp; by <a id="l3443"></a>counsel of Balaam committed whoredom with Balac. The same church apostatized <a id="l3444"></a>in the reign of Iezebel. The outward court is the court of the church or woman <a id="l3445"></a>&amp; degenerates to gentiles. The name upon her forehead [Mystery] alludes to the Iews <a id="l3446"></a>phylacteries  as also does the name of blasphemy or idolatry on the beasts head &amp; the <a id="l3447"></a>mark in the hand &amp; forehead of his worshippers. These keep the form of the Church <a id="l3448"></a>say they are Iews and are not,  preside &amp; worship in the place of the out<a id="l3449"></a>ward court the place of the Church &amp; so are the church in Apostacy <a id="l3450"></a>the woman  degenerate into a whore. They worship the Beast &amp; his image, receive <a id="l3451"></a>his mark &amp; number of his name as the saints worship God &amp; Christ &amp; are sea<a id="l3452"></a>led &amp; numbred.</p>
<br><br>
<p id="par231">The epistles to the seven Churches of Asia respect those churches before <a id="l3453"></a>their dissolution by the Apostacy, &amp; are admonitions to stand stedfast against <a id="l3454"></a>the commencing apostacy &amp; to  persevere under persecution. The first third fift <a id="l3455"></a>&amp; seventh respect the churches only before their fall. The second fourth &amp; sixt <a id="l3456"></a>strike through to the end &amp; respect the Church at both rising &amp; falling of the Apostacy. <a id="l3457"></a> Ephesus is commended for trying fals Apostles the ringleaders of the Apostacy &amp; <a id="l3458"></a>finding them lyars &amp; hating the doctrine of the Nicolaitans (i.e. spiritual fornicators or Idolaters): blamed for having left her first love (the heat of religion <a id="l3459"></a>through temporal prosperity of the Churches then abating) &amp; threatned that if she <a id="l3460"></a>return not to her first love her Candlestick shall be removed out of its place <a id="l3461"></a>that is, out of the Temple into a prophane place, which removal came to pass <a id="l3462"></a>when the woman fled into the wilderness. Romoving from place to place is changing <a id="l3463"></a>from state to state Apoc 12.9, 12, 14. Isa 14.12, 13. Apoc 6.14. &amp; 15.6 &amp; 16.20. Heb 12.27. Apoc 3.16.</p>
<p id="par232">Pergamus dwells where satan's seat is that is in the reign of the Dragon &amp; <a id="l3464"></a>then was Antipas slain where Satan dwelleth, that is the remnant of the womans <a id="l3465"></a>seed in the war the Dragon made upon them, as many as would not  <a id="l3466"></a>worship the Image of the beast were by the decree of the Image killed. Then <a id="l3467"></a>had they among them those nicolaitans (whom Balac by the counsel of Balaam seduced) <a id="l3468"></a>whom christ threatens at length to fight against with the sword of his mouth. if they repent not but go on to  apostatize.</p>
<p id="par233">Sardis had a name that she lived &amp; was dead &amp; is admonished to <a id="l3469"></a>strengthen the things which are ready to dy &amp; therefore is the church  in name &amp; outward appearance flourishing but grown spiritually  wretched &amp;  <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>dstylly<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> decaying, for which reason God gabe way to the Aposta<a id="l3471"></a>cy to prevaile.</p>
<p id="par234">So Laodicea is neither hot nor cold but luke warm &amp; therefore Christ <a id="l3472"></a>threatnes to  spewe her out of  his mouth, which is the same thing with removing <a id="l3473"></a>the Candlestick of Ephesus out of its place. The Churches are one body <a id="l3474"></a>&amp; what happens to one happens to all. Laodicea  said shee <a id="l3475"></a>was rich &amp; increased with goods &amp; had need of nothing &amp; knew not that <a id="l3476"></a>she was wretched &amp; miserable &amp; poor &amp; blind &amp; naked. She was therefore newly grown temporally rich &amp; spiritually <a id="l3477"></a>poor, &amp; for that reason soon after spewed out of Christs mouth: which was the <a id="l3478"></a>condition of the church in  the latter end of Constantius reign</p>

<p id="par242">Pray that your flight be not in winter nor on the sabbath day. Mat 24.

For that <a id="l3516"></a>which was  their true religion at the destruction of Ierusalem will be their <a id="l3517"></a>true religion at   their  future conversion. If the <a id="l3518"></a>observation of the Law was not then abrogated to the circumcised Iews, tis not <a id="l3519"></a>yet abrogated. If it was the abrogated &amp; only indulged to the  weak Iews for <a id="l3520"></a>faciliating their conversion, it may be indulged to the Iews hereafter for faci<a id="l3521"></a>liating their conversion.

That the Apostleships of circumcision &amp; uncircum<a id="l3541"></a>cision were distinct: that Paul in his epistles disputing against the law  usually includes the law of the 10 Commandments Rom 2, &amp; 6, 1 Tim. 1. &amp; so described no further abroga<a id="l3542"></a>tion of the law to the Iews then in  respect of justification thereby, &amp; if <a id="l3543"></a>any where he express any thing more he writes to Gentiles who by Christs death were <a id="l3544"></a>freed from the law, or if he write to Iews (as in the Epistle to the Hebrews) <a id="l3545"></a>he respects only that abrogation  of the Law which was  <a id="l3546"></a>speedily to come to pass by the destruction of the Temple. When I con<a id="l3547"></a>sider that Paul Saith he became to them under the law as under the law <a id="l3548"></a>that he might gain them under the law (not from the Law but to Christ under it) <a id="l3549"></a>&amp; to them without the law as without the law (not being without the law to <a id="l3550"></a>God but under the law to Christ) that he might gain them without the law: that <a id="l3551"></a>is, that notwithstanding his being under the law to Christ he behaved himself among <a id="l3552"></a>the Gentiles  as if he had not been under the <a id="l3553"></a>law that he might gain them: that the same Apostle  saith is any man  called being circum<a id="l3555"></a>cised let him not become uncircumcised: is any called in uncircumcision let <a id="l3556"></a>him not become circumcised: that he saith the Law is good &amp; circumcision profiteth <a id="l3557"></a>if a man keep the law, &amp; that every man that is circumcised is a debtor <a id="l3558"></a>to do the whole law &amp;  lastly that Christ himself admonished the beleiv<a id="l3559"></a>ing Iews to pray that their flight be not on the sabbath day. When I <a id="l3560"></a>consider all this it seems to me that the law is no otherwise abrogated <a id="l3561"></a>to the circumcised Iews then by the abrogation of justification by its works <a id="l3562"></a>&amp; by the destruction of the Temple. For  circumcision  is a  covenant to keep <a id="l3563"></a>the Law &amp;  the law is in its self good &amp; lawful,  being kept by the Apostles &amp; therefore every man <a id="l3565"></a>circumcised is as much bound thereby to keep it as any  man <a id="l3566"></a>who obliges himself by covenant or oath to do any other lawful thing is bound <a id="l3567"></a>to do the  same  For which reason the Apostle Paul saith that every <a id="l3568"></a>man that is circumcised is a debter to the do the whole law.  It seems therefore The Iews  are to be converted not from the law but in the law to Christ But whether  they shal circumcise their children <a id="l3570"></a>&amp; so oblige them also to keep the Law,  Elias will tell them at his coming.  It is enough for my purpose <a id="l3571"></a>they keep the sabbath day upon account of their own circumcision &amp; that <a id="l3572"></a>there is the same reason for their keeping the sabbath day hereafter as <a id="l3573"></a>heretofore whether it be through the obligation arising from circumcision (as it <a id="l3574"></a>seems to me) or only through indulgence for their more easy conversion.</p>

This Dragon was not slain but only changed his <a id="l3682"></a>place, that is, was translated from one people  to another &amp; from one <a id="l3683"></a>condition to another. The Devil was cast out from his old heathen empire &amp; came <a id="l3684"></a>down to the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea. These therefore are the Dragon for <a id="l3685"></a>the future.  The Dragon does not come down to them to persecute 'em but <a id="l3686"></a>to deceive 'em. Wo be to the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea for the Devil is come <a id="l3687"></a>to you  with great wrath knowing he hath but a short time. A <a id="l3688"></a>wo is never denounced to the saints for persecution. We are  on the con<a id="l3689"></a>trary commanded to rejoyce exceedingly at such sufferings  as the greatest <a id="l3690"></a>blessing Matt 5.10, 11, 12. Iames 1.2. 1. Pet. 3.14. Acts 3.41. The wo is to the <a id="l3691"></a>wicked. To these the devil came down with great wrath to deceive them &amp; in them <a id="l3692"></a>to persecute the saints knowing he hath but a short time to reign amongst <a id="l3693"></a>them. The woman whom the Dragon now begins to persecute is the multi<a id="l3694"></a>tude which dwells in heaven &amp; triumphs at  Michaels victory obteined of God through <a id="l3695"></a>the word of their testimony. From this company the inhabitants of the earth &amp; <a id="l3696"></a>sea are distinguished &amp; therefore they are not the persecuted Woman <a id="l3697"></a>but a  distinct body, an erring sort of Christians deceived at <a id="l3698"></a>the Devils coming down to them, &amp; being deceived they become the Womans enemy <a id="l3699"></a>And to signify that they are the Dragon which now begins to persecute <a id="l3700"></a>her, tis said before the persecution begins, that the Devil is come down to <a id="l3701"></a>them. For this is all one as to say that the  Devil so soon as cast <a id="l3702"></a>out of his old throne, seats himself amongst the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea, that is that the <a id="l3703"></a>name of Dragon  descends from the old heathen empire to the kingdom <a id="l3704"></a>of these inhabitants.</p>
<p id="par254">So soon as the Dragon saw he was cast down he persecuted the <a id="l3705"></a>woman.  The woman is the seven churches of Asia. For the epistles respect her now. As the head city of the Apostacy is put for the whole Apostacy so the head of the true church is put for the whole. The inhabitants of the <a id="l3706"></a>earth &amp; sea  having the Devil amongst them persecute  those who dwell in heaven <a id="l3707"></a>&amp; consequently have the temporal power on their side. For persecution is not <a id="l3708"></a>raised but by those who have temporal dominion over those they persecute. <a id="l3709"></a>So then at the victory of Michael  Christians become divided into two <a id="l3710"></a>parties those that dwel in heaven &amp; the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea &amp; <a id="l3711"></a>the temporal power goes along with these erring inhabitants, &amp; by consequence <a id="l3712"></a>becomes now the Dragon. The earth &amp; sea are the eastern &amp; western <a id="l3713"></a>parts of the Empire.  The devil <a id="l3714"></a>comes down to both &amp; therefore both now become the Dragon &amp; this Dragon <a id="l3715"></a>being able to persecute must be the ruling party in both, that is the Christi<a id="l3716"></a>an Roman empire. So then  at the victory of Michael the Devil <a id="l3717"></a>being cast out of his old throne &amp; coming down to  the inhabitants  <a id="l3718"></a>of the earth &amp; sea, the name of Dragon  descended then from the Roman <a id="l3719"></a>heathen Empire to the Roman Christian. So long as the heathen empire <a id="l3720"></a>stood the christian is  called the manchild.  But when the <a id="l3721"></a> heathen was cast out the  christian erring exchanges the name of <a id="l3722"></a>the manchild for that of the Dragon &amp; this is signified by the  Man <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p049r"> &lt;49r&gt; </span> childs being caught up from hence to God, &amp; by <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Dragons being cast out of <a id="l3723"></a>heaven to the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea. The Christian empire  by Michels victory became the same with the old Roman heathen Empire in <a id="l3725"></a>all respects but religion &amp; now erring from the right faith &amp; becoming the <a id="l3726"></a>Womans enemy as the Heathen Empire was before, to express that error it inhe<a id="l3727"></a>rits the name as well as the kingdome of the old Dragon. This is that Dragon <a id="l3728"></a>who gave the Beast his power &amp; seat &amp; great authority &amp; therefore is that <a id="l3729"></a>empire wherein the Beast reigned afterwards, that is the Roman Empire.</p>
<p id="par255">When the Dragon saw he was cast  unto the earth he persecuted the woman &amp; there were given her two wings <a id="l3730"></a>of a great Eagle that she might fly into the wilderness,  unto her place. The per<a id="l3731"></a>secution therefore began presently after Michael's victory &amp; then by the founding <a id="l3732"></a>of Constantinople &amp; erecting a Senate there which should rule the east as Rome <a id="l3733"></a>did the west, the church by partaking of this division of the empire into eastern <a id="l3734"></a>&amp; western had two wings of the great Roman Eagle or empire given her  <a id="l3735"></a>&amp; as it  were on these wings flew  first into the wilderness  &amp; then in the wilderness unto her place  prepared there <a id="l3739"></a>of God that they should nourish her there a time times &amp; an half. Nor This <a id="l3740"></a>flying from place to place signifies  either a running of the church out of one kingdom <a id="l3741"></a>into another  or a changing of condition. Not the first For the wilderness is the territory of <a id="l3742"></a>the waters or beast on which the whore sitteth chap 17 &amp; consequently the  seat which <a id="l3743"></a>the  Dragon gave the Beast, that is the Roman empire in which the woman was fro<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>m<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3744"></a>the beginning. She fled not therefore out of the empire  &amp; by consequence only changed her <a id="l3745"></a>condition within it. So the Dragons being cast out of heaven to the earth &amp; coming <a id="l3746"></a>down amongst the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea signifies not a transition of the <a id="l3747"></a>Dragons kingdome from place to place but a changing it from condition to <a id="l3748"></a>condition, from heathen to Christian.  The woman therefore fled <a id="l3757"></a>by changing her condition only &amp; this change was either by dissolving her  government,  dispersing her &amp; lessening her <a id="l3759"></a>numbers so that at length she escaped the Dragon by lying hid &amp; invisible amongst <a id="l3760"></a>the people of the Empire as in a wilderness; or els it was by her degene<a id="l3761"></a>rating in point of religion &amp; embracing a fals religion to escape the Dra<a id="l3762"></a>gons persecution. Not the first for so the woman would be all one with <a id="l3763"></a>the remnant of her seed which she left behind her in her flight &amp; ye<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>t<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3764"></a>those were not so few &amp; invisible as after her flight to escape the Dragons <a id="l3765"></a>making war upon them. It remains therefore that her flight was by <a id="l3766"></a>changing her condition in point of Religion. Thus when Christ threatens to <a id="l3767"></a>remove the candlestick of Ephesus out of its place, he meanes not that he <a id="l3768"></a>would  remove the Church from one country to another. Such a transition <a id="l3769"></a>would be no great punishment, the advantage in one country countervailing the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p049v"> &lt;49v&gt; </span> detriment in another Nor does he mean that he would dissolve &amp; extinguish the <a id="l3770"></a>church. That would be to  destroy the candlestick or put out its <a id="l3771"></a>light rather then to remove it out of its place into another place. The <a id="l3772"></a>meaning is that he would remove the candlestick out of its place in the Temple <a id="l3773"></a>into  a prophane place, that is that he would remove the visible church <a id="l3774"></a> from its state of holiness to a state of prophaneness. The seven candlesticks <a id="l3775"></a>being seven churches united in one body,  like the seven candlesticks in the <a id="l3776"></a>Temple which were but seven sockets in one stem, what is said to one of <a id="l3777"></a>then is said to all,  that is to the woman. Vnder the type of a candlestick <a id="l3778"></a>she is threatned to be removed out of her place in heaven &amp; this removal <a id="l3779"></a>is performed by her flight thence into the wilderness. The same thing is also <a id="l3780"></a>expressed by Christs spewing the church of Laodicea out of his mouth.</p>
<p id="par256">Now this flight is double: first into the wilderness &amp; then in the wild<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>er<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><a id="l3781"></a>ness into her place prepared there of God.  A natural wilderness signifies <a id="l3782"></a>a place naturally barren, a spiritual wilderness a place spiritually barren. <a id="l3783"></a> Hence the men who have not the seale of God in their foreheads that is <a id="l3784"></a>they who have the mark of the Beast &amp; consequently the inhabitants of the Wilder<a id="l3785"></a>ness where the Beasts kingdome is (Apoc 17) are opposed to grass &amp; green things <a id="l3786"></a>&amp; trees Apoc 9.4. which is as much as to say that the wilderness in the Apoc. <a id="l3787"></a>is taken for a  place or state wherein  there grows nothing spiri<a id="l3788"></a>tually green Also the witnesses in the days of their prophesy cause that it rain not i.e. spiritually for bringing for spiritual fruits. Wherefore  by the womans flight into the wilderness is to be <a id="l3789"></a>understood her flight into a condition of spirituall barrenness, or her ceasing to <a id="l3790"></a>bring forth fruits of the spirits. The giving her wings to fly  from the <a id="l3791"></a>persecuting Dragon may at first sight seem a blessing, but 'tis only a <a id="l3792"></a>temporal one. To escape his fury she forsakes the truth &amp; flyes into a <a id="l3793"></a>state  void of all fruits of the spirit. <a id="l3794"></a>By this flight the woman becomes distinguished into two parts the multitude <a id="l3795"></a>which flys &amp; continues to be represented by the woman, &amp; the remnant of her <a id="l3796"></a>seed which keep the commandments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus whom <a id="l3797"></a>the Dragon therefore after  his anger against the flying Woman goes to persecute. This rem<a id="l3798"></a>nant by their not flying  that is by their persevering in their <a id="l3799"></a>former state &amp; by their keeping the commandments of God &amp;  continuing under persecution <a id="l3800"></a>are plainly the pure part of the Church. The woman by flying from these in<a id="l3801"></a>to the wilderness separates from the pure part of the Church &amp; consequently dege<a id="l3802"></a>nerates. The meaning of the type therefore is that  upon the Dragons <a id="l3803"></a>persecution the main body of the church which still keep the outward form <a id="l3804"></a>of  the Church &amp; so continue to be represented by the woman <a id="l3805"></a>forsake their station, separate from the  true beleivers, by apostacy <a id="l3806"></a> escape the Dragons wrath, fly into a state of spirituall fruitlesness <a id="l3807"></a>&amp; leave only a remnant behind them which keep the commandments <a id="l3808"></a>of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus &amp; which  because they do <a id="l3809"></a> not fly into the Wilderness the Dragon continues still to persecute</p>
<p id="par257"> The woman after her flight into the wildernes continues  to fly   further <a id="l3810"></a>into her place  where <a id="l3811"></a>they should nourish her a time times &amp; an half or 1260 days. That is she flyes <a id="l3812"></a>on in the wilderness to a certain state of prosperity wherein she should continue <a id="l3813"></a>1260 days. Flesh &amp; food signify riches &amp; eating of flesh is getting much riches. Whence the <a id="l3814"></a>womans being fed &amp; nourished will signify her being increased with riches. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p050r"> &lt;50r&gt; </span> Whence her place in the Wildernes is a state of affluence &amp; prosperity. In <a id="l3815"></a>this state she continues  a time times &amp; an half or  1260 days that is all the <a id="l3816"></a>time that witnesses prophesy in sackcloth  the gentiles tread down the outer court, &amp; the <a id="l3817"></a>reigning Beast is worshipped by all the world except the saints which he therefore makes war upon.  So great is the difference between the woman &amp; the true church. And hence you <a id="l3819"></a>may understand that this woman becomes that rich Whore  in the wilderness  <a id="l3820"></a>fed with all kind of pretious things by the Merchants of the earth Apoc 17 &amp; 18. <a id="l3821"></a>The Dragon by persecution turns her to his religion that is to  <a id="l3822"></a> be idolatrous &amp; consequently a whore, &amp; becoming <a id="l3823"></a>at length a rich whore, she differs not from the whore of Babylon. Hence in allusion <a id="l3824"></a>to the little horn in Daniel she is said to be fed a time times &amp; an half. For that <a id="l3825"></a> horn is the same with this whore. To lay the greater emphasis upon the place pre<a id="l3826"></a>pared for the woman in the wilderness, tis said that <a id="l3827"></a>this place is prepared  of God for her. This shews it to be some very <a id="l3828"></a>notable  state. This lookes like a remarkable blessing &amp; so it is a temporal <a id="l3829"></a>one. God prepares her a place in the wilderness: but 'tis only that they should feed <a id="l3830"></a>&amp; nourish her there.  <a id="l3834"></a>And such a place or state of prosperity does God prepare the whore of Baby<a id="l3835"></a>lon in the wilderness. For he puts in the heart of the ten kings to agree  <a id="l3836"></a>&amp; give their kingdome to the Beast over which she reigns.</p>
<p id="par258"> So soon as the eagles wings are given the woman to fly into the wildernes <a id="l3837"></a>the Dragon cast out waters as a flood after to cause her to be carried away. <a id="l3838"></a>&amp; the earth opened her mouth &amp; swallowed up the waters Waters are people &amp; a river or flood is a body politick of men, a dynasty or <a id="l3839"></a>kingdom.  And the eastern &amp; western Empires  being distinguished by the names of <a id="l3840"></a>earth &amp; water, the western is sometimes represented by the sea  <a id="l3841"></a>Apoc 12 <span class="hspac-n" title="11 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> sometimes by rivers as being divided into many kingdomes Apoc <span class="hspac-n" title="9 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>  &amp; here by water as <a id="l3842"></a>a flood or river. The dragon therefore cast out of his mouth the western Em<a id="l3843"></a>pire, whereby the woman was almost violently carried away as with a flood. But the <a id="l3844"></a> earth or eastern empire by the victory of Constantius over the west <a id="l3845"></a>swallowed up the waters.  Then the Dragon in the reign of Iulian the <a id="l3846"></a>Apostate was wroth with the woman  newly reskued from the waters &amp; not yet <a id="l3847"></a>got into the wildernes &amp; she flying from him went to make war with the rem<a id="l3848"></a>nant of her seed in the reign of Theodosius. Tis not said that he made war <a id="l3849"></a>but  that he went to make war,  As the womans flight was a change of her condition, so the Dragons going from place to place is a change of his condition before he made that war. And this change was made by the Beasts rising out of the sea</p>
<p id="par259">The Dragon therefore going to make war the Beast at the same time rises out of the sea having <a id="l3851"></a>seaven heads &amp; ten horns &amp; one of his heads wounded to death with a sword, &amp; his  mortal <a id="l3852"></a>wound was healed. This Beast is the same with that in the seventeenth chapter which <a id="l3853"></a>was &amp; is not &amp; shal ascend out of the bottomles pit. It was before it was mortally <a id="l3854"></a>wounded, with a sword, &amp; by that wound ceased for a time to be &amp; at the healing <a id="l3855"></a>of the wound rose out of the  abyss. The abyss is the sea &amp; there<a id="l3856"></a>fore the beast rose out of the sea at the healing of his mortal wound. He was <a id="l3857"></a>that flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth.  He was <a id="l3858"></a>wounded to death with a sword &amp; ceased to be when the earth swallowed up the <a id="l3859"></a> flood, &amp; when he rose out of the sea or Abyss ἔξησἔ he revived &amp; his <a id="l3860"></a>mortal wound was healed. This his rising out of the sea was at the new division of the Empire in the beginning of Valentinians reign.</p>
<p id="par260"> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p050v"> &lt;50v&gt; </span> </p>
<p id="par261">The Beast had seven heads &amp; ten horns &amp; upon his horns ten crowns. The <a id="l3863"></a>Dragons crowns were upon his heads. Both have the same heads &amp; horns  &amp; <a id="l3864"></a>so signify the same empire from beginning to end, but the Dragon reigns in the <a id="l3865"></a>time of the heads  &amp; the Beast in the time of <a id="l3866"></a>the <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>horns<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; when the Dragon reigns the Beast lies hid in him,  &amp; is therefore at length spewed <a id="l3867"></a>out of his mouth like a flood &amp;  is not new born but rises out <a id="l3868"></a>of the Roman Sea as lying hid therein till his rise. Whence it is that Daniel <a id="l3869"></a>who in his shorter prophesy  distinguishes the reign of the horns but not <a id="l3870"></a>the reign of the heads, calls this Empire only the Beast. The reign of the <a id="l3871"></a>heads was successive Apoc 17.10 that of the horns contemporary Apoc 17.12. <a id="l3872"></a>Anid therefore so long as the Empire continues monarchical the Dragon reigns, <a id="l3873"></a>where the monarchical form finally ceases there begins the reign of the Beast <a id="l3874"></a>And this happened at the death of Theodosius. Between the death of Constan<a id="l3875"></a>tine &amp; Theodosius the  Empire was sometimes divided sometimes united <a id="l3876"></a> &amp; when divided the  western Empire is the Beast the eastern the Dra<a id="l3877"></a>gon, thô when orthodox not called the Dragon but the earth. At constantines <a id="l3878"></a>death the Dragon  cast the Beast out of his mouth as a flood. The beast <a id="l3879"></a>then (according to his nature) was first a  compounded kingdome under constantine <a id="l3880"></a>the younger &amp; Constans &amp; then  grew united under Constans &amp; Magnentius <a id="l3881"></a>&amp; was slain by the sword of Constantius &amp; revived at the new division of the <a id="l3882"></a>Empire in the beginning of Valentinians reign. Then came the Dragon to him in <a id="l3883"></a>the end of Theodosius reign by the victory of Theodosius over  Eugenius, <a id="l3884"></a>&amp; by Theodosius last will &amp; Testament  making a perpetual division of the empire <a id="l3885"></a> gave him his power Throne &amp; great authority. This coming of  the Dragon <a id="l3886"></a>to the Beast was rather friendly then hostile For Eugenius the shortlived western Em<a id="l3887"></a>peror being a heathen was an enemy to the Beasts religion.  <a id="l3888"></a>Theodosius conquered Eugenius Anno 394 &amp; four months after 17 Kal. <a id="l3889"></a>Feb VIII Id. Sept anno 395 died &amp; left the empire divided. So that considering the short <a id="l3890"></a> reign of Theodosius over the whole, the Dragon came as it were only <a id="l3891"></a>to establish the Beast &amp; give him his own throne &amp; authority.</p>
<p id="par262"> I have sometimes doubted whether  after <a id="l3892"></a>the division of the Empire into Eastern &amp; Western, the Dragon did not signify <a id="l3893"></a>the Eastern &amp; the Beast the western to the end of the Prophesy. But  consider<a id="l3894"></a>ing that Daniels Beast was the whole &amp; that the Apocalyptic Beast is the same <a id="l3895"></a>with Daniels. Also that the Dragon before the rise of the Beast was the whole <a id="l3896"></a>&amp;  that Daniels beast &amp; this Dragon had but ten horns &amp; the Beast <a id="l3897"></a>has all those horns crowned &amp; consequently reigns in all the  ten King<a id="l3898"></a>domes the whole was to be divided into, I am satisfied that as the Dragon before <a id="l3899"></a>the rise of the Beast signifies the whole so the Beast after the Dragon gives <a id="l3900"></a>him his power &amp; throne signifies also the whole. And this universality of the Beast <a id="l3901"></a>is  confirmed by his having power over all kindreds &amp; tongues &amp; <a id="l3902"></a>nations &amp; being worshipped by all that dwell upon the earth whose names <a id="l3903"></a>are not written in the book of life. Apoc 13.7, 8. And thô the Dragon be <a id="l3904"></a> afterward mentioned with the Beast in the battel of the great day <a id="l3905"></a>Apoc 16.13 &amp; 20.1, 2 yet when I consider that the bottomles pit (not the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p051r"> &lt;51r&gt; </span> abyss the beast rose out of but a narrow-mouthed pit with  a covere which <a id="l3906"></a>remained lockt up till the locusts were let out)  was then unlockt &amp; remained <a id="l3907"></a>open till the Angel cast the Dragon into it &amp; shut it up again, &amp; that the <a id="l3908"></a>locusts which came out of this pit had tails like scorpions with stings in <a id="l3909"></a>them &amp; so were of a serpentine kind &amp; that their successors also the Euphratean <a id="l3910"></a>horsmen had tails like serpents: it seems to me that the  casting <a id="l3911"></a>the Dragon into the bottomles pit &amp; locking him up therein that he should deceive the nations no more is a type of <a id="l3912"></a>the ceasing of that  serpentine religion which came out of the same pit <a id="l3913"></a>before &amp; continued to deceive the nations till the shutting up of the Dragon <a id="l3914"></a>For thus  in the casting the Beast &amp; fals Prophet into the lake of fire &amp; <a id="l3915"></a>Dragon into the bottomless pit  superadded to the overthrow of paganism in Michaels victory before will the ceasing of all errors be comprehended <a id="l3916"></a>&amp; doubtles it was the mind of the Prophesy to express the ceasing of all <a id="l3917"></a>errours at that great victory   of the saints So then the Dragon <a id="l3918"></a>being secretly translated to signify that new serpentine generation of men leaves the <a id="l3919"></a>Beast to signify the  whole Roman Empire <a id="l3920"></a>.</p>


<p id="par265">Now the meaning of the heads &amp; horns is described more fully in the 17<sup>th</sup> <a id="l3921"></a>chapter. I will tell thee saith the Angel the mystery of the woman &amp; of the <a id="l3922"></a>Beast that carrieth her which hath the 7 heads &amp; ten horns, that is, I will <a id="l3923"></a>tell the the mystery of the beast  as to his heads &amp; horns. The Beast <a id="l3924"></a>which thou sawest was &amp; is not &amp; shall ascend out of the abyss &amp; go into <a id="l3925"></a>perdition, And they that dwell on the earth shal wonder whose names <a id="l3926"></a>are not written in the book of life  from the foundation of the <a id="l3927"></a>world) when they behold the beast that was &amp; is not &amp; is at hand. Here is <a id="l3928"></a>the mind which hath wisdome,  (a mystery which requires wisdome to  <a id="l3929"></a>understand aright) The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman <a id="l3930"></a>sitteth. Also they are seven kings: five are fallen &amp; one is &amp; the other is <a id="l3931"></a>not yet come &amp; when he cometh he must continue a short space  &amp; the Beast which was &amp; is not he is the eighth &amp; is of the <a id="l3933"></a>seven &amp; goeth into perdition. And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten <a id="l3934"></a>kings which have received no kingdome as yet but receive power as kings <a id="l3935"></a>at the same hour with the Beast.  From which words I observe; First <a id="l3936"></a>that the  <a id="l3937"></a>heads are successive, Five are fallen &amp; one is &amp; another is not yet come &amp; <a id="l3938"></a>when he cometh he must continue a short space, that is unto the rise of the <a id="l3939"></a>Beast who is the eighth of the seaven that is the latter part of the seventh <a id="l3940"></a>divided into two. Secondly that the  horns are contemporary  kings <a id="l3941"></a>reigning in the eighth head. They receive their kingdome the same hour with the <a id="l3942"></a>beast or eighth head &amp; (as is said afterward agre &amp; give their kingdome to the beast. There <a id="l3943"></a>are therefore seven kings or heads reigning before the rise of the beast &amp; the <a id="l3944"></a>beast begins his reign in the eighth head with the 10  kings. Whence the <a id="l3945"></a>Dragons heads are crowned &amp; not his horns &amp; the beasts horns are cround &amp; <a id="l3946"></a>not his heads. Thirdly that the words five are fallen &amp; one is &amp;c relate not to <a id="l3947"></a>the time the Prophet lived in but only to the words  the Beast was &amp; is not &amp; shal <a id="l3948"></a>ascend. And this is that mystery the  Prophet tells us of in these words <a id="l3949"></a>Here saith he is the mind that hath wisdome. First  as a foundation <a id="l3950"></a>of describing the mysteries of the beast he saith The beast was &amp; is not &amp; shall ascend <a id="l3951"></a>out of the  abyss &amp; go into perdition. Then he tells us there is a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p051v"> &lt;51v&gt; </span> mystery in what he is saying. Here is the mind which hath wisdome: And then <a id="l3952"></a>he adds that the seven heads are seven kings: five are fallen &amp; one is &amp; the <a id="l3953"></a>other is not yet come &amp; when he cometh he must continue a short space, &amp; the beast which was &amp; is not he is the eighth &amp; is of the <a id="l3954"></a>seven &amp; goeth into perdition. These last words the beast was &amp; is not  <a id="l3955"></a>he  is the eighth &amp; goeth into perdition do plainly relate to the former: <a id="l3956"></a>The beast was &amp; is not &amp; ascendeth out of the bottomles pit &amp; goeth into <a id="l3957"></a>perdition &amp; so shew that for understanding  the <a id="l3958"></a>mystery of the heads we must have  respect to the words  the beast was &amp; is not. Were the words to be understood literally as <a id="l3960"></a>if the Beast was before the Prophets time, was not in his time &amp; after his <a id="l3961"></a>time rose out of the abyss &amp; of the seven heads five were before his time  the sixt in <a id="l3962"></a>his time &amp; the seventh to  be after his time, there would be no difficulty <a id="l3963"></a>in the interpretation, no need of the Prophets exclamation, Here is the mind that hath <a id="l3964"></a>wisdome. We are therefore to understand the saings with a grain of salt, inter<a id="l3965"></a>preting them not with relation to the Prophets time but only to one ano<a id="l3966"></a>ther as if the meaning were this nothing more, That  at that time when the beast shall cease <a id="l3968"></a>to be, five of the heads shall be fallen &amp; the sixt shall be in being &amp; after <a id="l3969"></a>the seventh  has continued a short space the beast which ascendeth out of <a id="l3970"></a>the  abyss shall begin his reign &amp; constitute an eighth head which yet is <a id="l3971"></a>of the seaven as being the latter part of the seventh.</p>
<p id="par266">And this frees us from the  absurdity of looking for five of the heads before <a id="l3972"></a>the Prophets age &amp; for that end making the Beast to begin with Romulus when <a id="l3973"></a>the Roman kingdome was inconsiderable &amp; the first of  the four Monarchies <a id="l3974"></a>was not yet begun, &amp; recconning these heads to be not five successive go<a id="l3975"></a>vernments  but five sorts of government which interfered with one another <a id="l3976"></a>Kings the first head, Consuls the second, a Dictator the third, still consuls the second <a id="l3977"></a>Decemviri the 4<sup>th</sup> of three years continuance only, Consuls the second, Tribuni <a id="l3978"></a>militum the 5<sup>t</sup>, Consuls the second, &amp; again Tribuni militum  consuls <a id="l3979"></a>&amp; Dictators several times interfering &amp; next after Consuls the second head <a id="l3980"></a>come Emperors the sixt.  This   <a id="l3981"></a>splitting of the heads &amp; jumbling them together with any order of succession <a id="l3982"></a>seems to me very harsh &amp; absolutely contrary to the mind of the prophesy <a id="l3983"></a>where they are described successive. Nor is the Apocalyps a history of things <a id="l3984"></a>past but a prophesy of things to come. We are therefore to look for the <a id="l3985"></a>heads  within the compas of things <a id="l3986"></a>prophesied of &amp; there we may easily find them. For the seven seales <a id="l3987"></a>are divisions of the empire into five successive parts or heads before the <a id="l3988"></a>rise of the beast. The horsmen in the four first are plainly four kings <a id="l3989"></a>or heads.  For riding signifies reigning &amp; a horsman a king. These <a id="l3990"></a>begin with Vespasian in the east,  Trajan in the west, Severus in the South, Maxi<a id="l3991"></a>minus or rather Decius in the north. Diocles &amp;  Maximianus setting <a id="l3992"></a>up a mixt government begin the fift head signalized by the persecution of <a id="l3993"></a>the fift seale. Constantine at the conquest of Licinius reducing the Empire againe to a monarchical <a id="l3994"></a>form begins the sixt head. Then was the Dragon cast out of his old throne <a id="l3995"></a>&amp; begins a new reign amongst the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea.  <a id="l3996"></a>Which change is deservedly recconed a new head. The character of this <a id="l3997"></a>head or seale is the demolishing heathen Idolatry. This action lasted till the reign of <a id="l3998"></a>Iulian the Apostate. He altering the scene of things  breaks of the cha<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p052r"> &lt;52r&gt; </span>racter of this seale &amp; so begins the Dragons seventh head. Thus in the latter <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>end<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3999"></a>of Constantius reign when the beast being mortally wounded in one of his <a id="l4000"></a>heads (the sixt) had ceased to be, five heads were fallen &amp; one was &amp;  <a id="l4001"></a>another was not come &amp; when he came he continued a short space from  <a id="l4002"></a> Iulian to the death of Theodosius, &amp; then  the crowns ceased for ever <a id="l4004"></a>to be on the Dragons  successive monarchical heads &amp; were set upon the <a id="l4005"></a>Beasts collateral horns. For as the perpetual reign of collateral kings began <a id="l4006"></a>at Theodosius's death, so within the space of 14 or 15 years after  all <a id="l4007"></a> the ten were in being, receiving power as kings as it were the same hour with the <a id="l4008"></a>Beast. Now whereas the seventh head or seale is divided into two parts,  the seventh <a id="l4010"></a>head which continued but a short space &amp; the Beast which is the eighth &amp; of the <a id="l4011"></a>seven, in like manner the seventh seale is distinguished into two parts, the <a id="l4012"></a>short time before the   Trumpets sounded &amp; the time of their <a id="l4013"></a>sounding. The first is therefore the  seventh head &amp; the last <a id="l4014"></a>the eighth &amp; of the seven, &amp; consequently the trumpets begin to sound at the <a id="l4015"></a>death of Theodosius, when the beast begins his reign.</p>

While the Roman Empire continued <a id="l4042"></a>united the church catholick was represented by one golden candlestick <a id="l4043"></a>with seven branches, but when the empire became divided into two Empires the two Churches <a id="l4044"></a>in  those Empires composing the Church catholick were represented by two candlesticks of olive wood.

<p id="par272">When the temple was opened in heaven for Iohn to see the Visions in it <a id="l4064"></a>he saw there the Ark ...... &amp; being forbid to buy &amp; sell, that is being excommu<a id="l4065"></a>nicated, retire from the multitude ........  of the same Temple..</p>
<p id="par273">The temple in the beginning had the ark in it &amp; therefore respresents the Tabernacle or first <a id="l4066"></a>temple  &amp; they that worshipped in it were the twelve tribes of <a id="l4067"></a>Israel. For the 144000 were numbered &amp; sealed out of all the twelve tribes <a id="l4068"></a>of Israel. And twelve tribes being all Israel were the Church catholick &amp; <a id="l4069"></a>they inhabited the earth &amp; sea because the Angel which had the seale of God <a id="l4070"></a>cried with a loud voice saying hurt not the earth &amp; sea till we have <a id="l4071"></a>sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. The Church catholick <a id="l4072"></a>therefore at this time received a great alteration, &amp; became divided into two parties <a id="l4073"></a>The multitude received the mark or name of the beast or number of his name &amp; the 144000 were sealed <a id="l4074"></a>with the name of God &amp; both parties inhabited the earth &amp; sea, but separated <a id="l4075"></a> from one another in communion.  The multitude staid in the outward court where   they used to worship, &amp; the 144000 being excommunicated by the multitude retired into the  eastern border of the Priests court, which border was in the times of the second Temple called the  court of Israel To worship the Beast &amp; his Image is <a id="l4080"></a>to deify them, &amp; to receive his mark or name or the number of his name <a id="l4081"></a>is to be initiated in his worship . And seing they  that were initiated were of the twelve <a id="l4082"></a>tribes of Israel, by this initiation they became the synagogue of Satan who say <a id="l4083"></a>they are Iews &amp; are not,  And in like manner  to be sealed with the name of God &amp; <a id="l4085"></a>Christ in the forehead is to be initiated in  the Church of God &amp; Christ. <a id="l4086"></a>By the apostasy of the twelve tribes to the worship of the Beast &amp; his Image the first <a id="l4087"></a>Church of Christ was dissolved &amp; by the sealing of the 144000 with the name of <a id="l4088"></a>God &amp; Christ in their foreheads a new Church was instituted, &amp; this is <a id="l4089"></a>represented by measuring the second Temple &amp; the Altar &amp; them [the 144000] that wor<a id="l4090"></a>ship therein,  &amp; by changing the form of the candlesticks <a id="l4091"></a> Before the marking &amp; sealing of the twelve tribes the <a id="l4092"></a>Church catholick was represented by one golden candlestick with seven <a id="l4093"></a>branches called seven golden candlesticks;  but <a id="l4095"></a>upon that marking &amp; sealing, the candlestick is changed &amp; two candlesticks of olive tree <a id="l4096"></a>are put to represent the 144000. For then the Empire become divided into <a id="l4097"></a>two Empires represented by the Dragon &amp; Beast &amp; the Church becomes divided <a id="l4098"></a>accordingly  into two Churches seated in the two empires &amp; is thenceforward <a id="l4099"></a>represented by two candlesticks &amp; called two witnesses or martyrs as above.  <a id="l4100"></a>For when the Image spake as an oracle &amp; caused all that would not worship <a id="l4101"></a>it to be killed,  the 144000 were killed; not litterally, but by <a id="l4102"></a>dissolving their bodies ecclesiastic: &amp; being killed for not worshipping the Image <a id="l4103"></a>they became the  martyrs or witnesses of Iesus  or two witnesses. The two wings <a id="l4104"></a>of a  great Eagle which were given to the Woman <a id="l4105"></a>are the Greek &amp; Latin Churches &amp; these are the twelve tribes of Israel. When the two Beasts arose one out of the earth <a id="l4106"></a>the other out of the sea, then did these churches receive the mark of the beast <a id="l4107"></a>except the 144000 who being the remnant of the two wings are considered as two <a id="l4108"></a>churches &amp; accordingly represented by two Candlesticks &amp; for their sufferings &amp; testimony <a id="l4109"></a>against the worshippers of the Beast are called two witnesses: &amp; then did the Empire become divided between the Dragon &amp; the first Beast, &amp; the Church of the Empire or wings of the woman into two true churches called the two witnesses &amp; into fals ones called the two horned Beast &amp; the Whore of Babylon.</p>
<p id="par274">The Beast is sometimes ....... time will discover.</p>
<p id="par275"> &amp; the multitude of the two wings by  apostatising &amp; receiving <a id="l4110"></a>the mark of the Beast become the fals Churches represented by the  Whore of Bab. &amp; the two horned <a id="l4111"></a>Beast, &amp; these are the Churches of the  two Empires represented by the first Beast &amp; the Dragon. For when the first <a id="l4112"></a>Beast rises out of the sea the Empire becomes divided between him &amp; the Dragon, &amp; the Church becomes <a id="l4113"></a>divided into the Churches of the two Empires,   the worshippers of the Beast into two fals <a id="l4114"></a>Churches &amp; the worshippers of God into two true ones. For all Kingdoms have their churches.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p055r"> &lt;55r&gt; </span>

<p id="par277">When the Image of the Beast  spake  as an Oracle &amp; caused all that would <a id="l4116"></a>not worship it to be killed &amp; that all both small &amp; great rich &amp; poor free &amp; bond should <a id="l4117"></a>receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads &amp; that no man might buy or sell <a id="l4118"></a>but he that had the mark or name of the Beast or number of his name:  the Lamb stood on mount Sion  with  him an 144000 having the  name of God in their <a id="l4120"></a>foreheads. The multitude received the mark or name of the Beast &amp; excluded the rest <a id="l4121"></a>from their society, &amp; those that were excluded received the name of God  &amp; the Lamb <a id="l4122"></a>in their foreheads &amp; kept company with the Lamb on mount Sion,  <a id="l4123"></a> &amp; their number was 144000. These are therefore the 144000  <a id="l4124"></a>numbered out of all the twelve tribes of Israel &amp; sealed with the seal of God in their <a id="l4125"></a>foreheads,  &amp; at the same time that they were sealed the rest of the twelve tribes received the mark of the <a id="l4126"></a>Beast . The twelve <a id="l4127"></a>tribes of Israel  before this sealing were the Church catholick, &amp; this Church <a id="l4128"></a>catholick was diffused throughout the regions of the earth &amp; sea: &amp; therefore the <a id="l4129"></a> 144000 are sealed out of all the regions of the earth &amp; sea  For this <a id="l4131"></a>is signified by the Angel who had the seal of God &amp; cryed with a loud voice <a id="l4132"></a>saying hurt not the earth &amp; sea till we have sealed the servants of our <a id="l4133"></a>God in their foreheads. By this sealing &amp; marking  the Church <a id="l4134"></a>catholick diffused throughout the earth &amp; sea becomes distinguished into two <a id="l4135"></a>parties: the multitude which received the mark of the Beast &amp; the 144000 which <a id="l4136"></a> are sealed with the name of God &amp; both these parties are diffused throughout the <a id="l4137"></a>earth &amp; sea. The multitude of the twelve tribes by receiving the mark of the Beast <a id="l4138"></a>becomes the synagogue of Satan who say they are Iews &amp; are not; &amp; these prohibit buying <a id="l4139"></a>&amp; selling to those  who have not this mark that is excommunicate them. And the 144000 <a id="l4140"></a>who  are sealed with the name of God  &amp; exommunicated by the synagogue of Satan are for the future the <a id="l4141"></a>true Church catholick of Christ diffused through the earth &amp; sea.</p>

<p id="par278">The Temple being the scene of the visions I conceive that it remains the same  in all the visions from the beginning <a id="l4142"></a>to the end,  &amp; that in allusion to the times of the  tabernacle  or first temple or ~ ~ those of the second for <a id="l4143"></a>representing the various states of the church the things which appear in the temple are only <a id="l4144"></a>changed. The Ark being the throne of God remains the same  except perhaps in the second Temple which was measured The four Beasts <a id="l4145"></a>also representing the church catholick in all conditions remain the same.  In allusion to the <a id="l4146"></a>times of the Babylonian captivity to signify the like captivity of the Christian Church the form of the candlestick is changed &amp; the  eastern border of the  Priests court is made the courts of Israel &amp; the Woman flyes into the wilderness &amp; becomes the great <a id="l4148"></a>city Babylon which reigns over the kings of the earth,  &amp; the <a id="l4149"></a>Babylonian gentiles captivate the people of God invade that outward court of the temple place the abomination of desolation &amp; tread under foot the holy city  &amp; the  people of <a id="l4151"></a>God being forbidden to buy &amp; sell  by those who say they are Iews &amp; are not that is being excommunicated by the synagogue of Satan &amp; expelled their society, retire into  the eastern border of the Priests <a id="l4153"></a>court called the court of Israel &amp; there sing a new song,  standing as it were on the <a id="l4154"></a>sea of glass mingled with fire or the vessel of glass &amp; the water therein  that is on the earth &amp; sea.  <a id="l4156"></a>For this was the earth &amp; sea upon which the  son of man  stood in the form of an Angel <a id="l4157"></a>, &amp; these  victors standing in flames of fire signify <a id="l4158"></a>one &amp; the same thing  with the mystical body of the son of man standing on the earth &amp; sea with his two leggs like pillars of fire burning <a id="l4160"></a>as it were in a furnace, &amp; by standing on the sea of glass or on the earth &amp; sea they denote the two <a id="l4161"></a>churches called the two witnesses. // Their song on mount Sion is called a new song to denote <a id="l4162"></a>a new state of the Church.  And whereas while they stand on the sea of glass there appear in the temple seven Angels <a id="l4163"></a>having the seven last plagues &amp; upon their coming out of the temple of the Tabernacle one of the four Beasts gives <a id="l4164"></a>them seven vials of wrath  &amp; the temple is filled with smoke from so that they could not enter upon the glory of God This signifies that there is now a dedication of a new Temple like that of the Tabernacle in the wilderness Exod 40.34. 35., &amp; that the Church of God in this new state <a id="l4166"></a> inflicts these plagues by the hand of the seven Angels, &amp; so is the  same church <a id="l4167"></a> with the two witnesses who smite the earth with all plagues as often as they <a id="l4168"></a>will. For the four Beasts jointly &amp; severally represent the Church of God, &amp; the seven Angels <a id="l4169"></a> or seven spirits of God  are the seven stars or lamps, &amp; the two Witnesses are the two candlesticks <a id="l4170"></a>which support the seven lamps &amp;  supply them with oyle to make them con<a id="l4171"></a>tinue burning, &amp; what is done by the seven Angels is done by the seven Lamps &amp; by the <a id="l4172"></a>oyle of the two candlesticks which represent the two Witnesses.

<p id="par285"> – describes in the second temple Zech. 4.</p>
<p id="par286">The visions being in the temple, the Candlesticks must be conceived to resemble <a id="l4249"></a>the candlesticks in the  Temple. There was in the Tabernacle one golden <a id="l4250"></a>candlestick with seven branches &amp; seven lamps upon the branches &amp; in the Temple of <a id="l4251"></a>Solmon there were ten such candlesticks,  but in the Apocalyps there were but seven <a id="l4252"></a>lamps &amp; therefore but one candlestick with seven branches: which branches are called the <a id="l4253"></a>seven golden candlesticks.  One  branch was in the middle &amp; three on either side (Exod. 25.<a id="l4254"></a>32)  the lamps being in a right line so as to appear to Iohn like a rod of seven stars in <a id="l4255"></a>the right hand of the son of man. The seven  candlesticks  signify <a id="l4256"></a>seven churches &amp; all seven are but one sevenfold church, &amp; so  are most fitly represented by one <a id="l4257"></a>sevenfold candlestick. The seven lamps enlighten the temple &amp; the temple represents the Church <a id="l4258"></a>catholick. These lamps are the seven spirits of God (Apoc. 4.5) &amp; the seven spirits  are sent <a id="l4259"></a>forth into all the earth (Apoc. 5.6. &amp; Zech 4.10) &amp; therefore the lamps are the light of the Church <a id="l4260"></a>catholick,  &amp; the sevenfold candlestick is  a symbol of the Church catholick. And <a id="l4261"></a>as the horns of a beast represent the number of powers or dominions presiding over the people repre<a id="l4262"></a>sented by the body of the Beast so the seven branches of the candlestick represent  seven powers or dominions  which Christ  set over the Church  catholick  to in<a id="l4264"></a>struct it &amp; illuminate it by their light. For this end he sent seven epistles to the seven <a id="l4265"></a>Churches &amp; dressed their lamps.  Iohn presided there long after the death of the <a id="l4266"></a>rest of the Apostles &amp; left  a race of disciples which made those Churches the light of <a id="l4267"></a>the Church catholick in the first ages of the  Christian religion. And the same thing is <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p056v"> &lt;56v&gt; </span> signified by the Lamb with his seven horns &amp; seven eyes. His mystical body is the Church <a id="l4268"></a>catholick. His eyes are the seven spirits of God &amp; his horns the seven Churches. <a id="l4269"></a>And this vision of the sevenfold candlesticks &amp; the Lamb with seven horns continues <a id="l4270"></a>while the Lamb is opening the seven seals: but upon opening the seventh seale <a id="l4271"></a>the Lamb changes his shape &amp; appears  in the form of <a id="l4272"></a>the high Priest with a golden censer to offer the prayers of the saints upon the <a id="l4273"></a>golden altar. I say he changes his shape: for he never appears in two shapes at once. And at the same time instead of the seven candlesticks of God there are two candlesticks of Olive tree. And henceforward the Church catholick is represented by the mysti<a id="l4274"></a>cal body of Christ in the form of an High Priest with  his leggs burning as it <a id="l4275"></a>were in a furnace by reason of the persecutions, ;  &amp; by two candlesticks called Olive trees <a id="l4277"></a>in allusion to the vision of Zechary  In that vision the seven lamps <a id="l4278"></a>were joyned to a golden bowle by seven golden pipes through which the oyle ran into <a id="l4279"></a>them &amp; the bowle stood upon a golden candlestick &amp; was joyned to two vessels of <a id="l4280"></a>oyle on either side by two godlen pipes through which the oyle ran into  it &amp; the two vessels were <a id="l4281"></a>supported by two Olive trees, not living trees  growing upon a root &amp; flourishing with <a id="l4282"></a> branches &amp; leaves but  shafts of olive wood. In the Apocalyps the two <a id="l4283"></a>olive trees are called two candlesticks, &amp; therefore you are to conceive that in the visions <a id="l4284"></a>as they appeared to Iohn the  whole golden frame of the lamps &amp; bowle &amp; <a id="l4285"></a>two vessels of oyle are supported by  two candlesticks of Olive tree standing <a id="l4286"></a>under the two vessels of oyle, without the golden candlestick under the bowle, there <a id="l4287"></a>being no mention of this golden candlestick in the visions of Iohn.</p>
<p id="par287">Christ threatned to remove the candlestick of the church of Ephesus out of its place, &amp; to spew <a id="l4288"></a>the Church of Laodicea out of his mouth. These being two branches of the sevenfold <a id="l4289"></a>golden candlestick, could not be removed alone. Conceive therefore that at the <a id="l4290"></a>opening of the seventh seal, when the Lamb with seven horns changes his shape into <a id="l4291"></a>that of the High Priest  or Angel standing at the golden altar &amp; as it were on the earth &amp; sea, the sevenfold golden <a id="l4292"></a>candlestick is removed, &amp; the two candlesticks of olive wood come into its place; &amp; <a id="l4293"></a>that the Angel continues standing  with his right foot on the earth <a id="l4294"></a>&amp; left foot on the sea all the time of this vision of the two candlesticks of <a id="l4295"></a>olive wood supporting the seven lamps: &amp; that the Church catholick which had been <a id="l4296"></a>hitherto represented by the sevenfold golden candlestick &amp; by the mystical body of <a id="l4297"></a>Christ in the form of a Lamb with seven horns, is henceforward represented by the <a id="l4298"></a>two candlesticks of olive wood &amp; by the mystical body of Christ standing with his right <a id="l4299"></a>foot on the earth &amp; his left foot on the sea,  <a id="l4300"></a>For Candlesticks signify churches, &amp; the two candlesticks which support all the seven lamps <a id="l4301"></a>can signify nothing less then the Church catholick.  <a id="l4302"></a>As  Nebuchadnezzars image by its ten toes represented the division of the fourth <a id="l4303"></a>monarchy into ten kingdoms &amp; by its two leggs the divison of it into two  empires: so Christ by his two leggs standing on the earth &amp; sea  represents the <a id="l4305"></a> Church catholick seated in the two empires of the earth &amp; sea, &amp; these are the two <a id="l4306"></a>candlesticks &amp; the two witnesses  which prophesy in the times of the seventh <a id="l4307"></a>seal. // <em class="underline">And if any man will hurt them</em> &amp; c</p>

<p id="par294">Vpon publishing the Apocalyps the opinion that the saints should reign <a id="l4393"></a>a thousand years on earth was spread in the Churches   as appears by the writings of Papias, Iustin Martyr, Ireneus &amp;c. But Cerinthus <a id="l4395"></a>&amp; other  vitious men  interpreting corruptly &amp; applying them to carnal pleasures, Dionysius <a id="l4396"></a>of Alexandria thought it not enough to tell them that they misunderstood the prophesy <a id="l4397"></a>but endeavoured also to undermine its authority. It was at that time universally received <a id="l4398"></a>in the Churches, so that he durst not oppose it openly  &amp; therefore he complemented it highly, but <a id="l4399"></a>pretended that it differed in stile from the Gospel of Iohn being fuller of Hebraisms <a id="l4400"></a>&amp; therefore it was written by another Iohn. And this objection made many of the <a id="l4401"></a>Greeks  in the fourth Century  doubt of its authority, but without any reason. For the <a id="l4402"></a>hebraisms in the Apocalyps argue only that he wrote this book when he came newly out <a id="l4403"></a>of Iudea where he had been more used to the Hebrew or Syriac tongue then to the Greek <a id="l4404"></a>whereas he wrote his Gospel  above thirty years after he came into Asia, <a id="l4405"></a>where  he used himself to the Greek tongue.  If the words Ο ων καὶ <a id="l4406"></a>ὁ ην καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος  (which Dionysius might take for a barbarism) be taken <a id="l4407"></a>for a proper name, the Apocalyps is writ in a clear stile like that of the Gospel <a id="l4408"></a>&amp; by the stile it may be known that they were both written by the same author. <a id="l4409"></a>For the Gospel is written in a more lofty style then  any other of the Gospels &amp; hath <a id="l4410"></a>its loftiness from the Apocalyptic phrases used in it, such as are these <em class="underline">In the begin<a id="l4411"></a>ning was the word &amp; the word was with God &amp; the word was God</em>, <em class="underline">All things were <a id="l4412"></a>made by him.</em>  <em class="underline">In him was life &amp; the life was the light of men.</em> I am the light of the world <em class="underline">Iohn <a id="l4413"></a>came for a witness to bear witness of that light.</em> If I bear record of my self yet my record is true. This is the disciple which testifieth these things. If any man thirst let him come unto me &amp; drink. Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living waters. <em class="underline">Behold the Lamb of God which takes <a id="l4414"></a>away the sins of the world. For </em> in the Apocalyps Christ is called, <em class="underline">The <a id="l4415"></a>beginning of the creation of God, the first &amp; the last, the Word of God, he who is alive <a id="l4416"></a>for evermore</em>,  whose face is like the sun in his strengh, who enlightneth the earth with his glory <em class="underline">the faithful &amp; true witness, the Lamb of God who hath washed away our <a id="l4417"></a>sins in his blood</em>.

<p id="par295">The Epistle of Paul to the Hebrews beig writ after the Apocalyps, has also <a id="l4420"></a>reference to it, &amp; is thereby rendred very different from his other Epistles <a id="l4421"></a>&amp; more  mystical &amp; majestic. For the discourses  concerning the great <a id="l4422"></a>High Priest in the heavenly tabernacle who is both Priest &amp; King as was Melchisedec upon Christs appearing <a id="l4423"></a>in the form of the High Priest in the begining of the Apocalyps &amp; offering up the <a id="l4424"></a>prayers of the saints with incense in the most Holy in the day of Expiation at the opening <a id="l4425"></a>of the seventh seal, &amp;  upon his being the king of kings &amp; the sacrifice represented by the lamb slain in the Temple . The Apocalyps is also alluded unto in the discourses concerning the Word of <a id="l4427"></a>God with the sharp two edged sword, the σαββατισμὸς or millennial rest, the earth <a id="l4428"></a>whose end is to be burned (suppose by the lake of fire) the judgment &amp; fiery in<a id="l4429"></a>dignation (or lake of fire) which shall devour the adversaries, the heavenly city (or new Ierusalem) which hath founda<a id="l4430"></a>tions  (twelve  in number) whose builder &amp; maker is God, the cloud of witnesses (or witnesses in a cloud,) <a id="l4431"></a> the throne of God, mount Sion, the city of the living God, the innumerable company of Angels, the general assembly &amp; Church; spirits of just men made <a id="l4432"></a>of the first born (or sons of the first resurrection) written in heaven, God the judge of all,  the perfect (viz<sup>t</sup> by the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> resurrection,) &amp; the shaking of heaven &amp; earth &amp; removing them <a id="l4433"></a>that those things (the new heaven &amp; new earth &amp; new kingdom) which cannot be shaken may <a id="l4434"></a>remain.

<p id="par297">The second Epistle from the 19<sup>th</sup> verse of the first chapter to the <a id="l4443"></a>end of the Epistle seems to be a continued commentary upon the Apocalyps <a id="l4444"></a>For in writing to the Churches of Asia to whome  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p059r"> &lt;59r&gt; </span> Iohn was commanded to send this Prophesy;  he tells them that  ‡ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 58v &gt; </span>‡ the power &amp; coming of Christ is no fable, but  the Apostles were  eye-witnesses <a id="l4446"></a>of his majesty  in the holy mount when there came a <a id="l4447"></a>voice from heaven saying, This is my beloved son, &amp; that it is manifested <a id="l4448"></a>to them (the Churches of Asia) more surely by the word of prophesy [the Revelation of Iesus Christ sent unto them] <a id="l4449"></a>whereunto they do well to  give heed as unto a light shining in a dark place –<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 59r resumes &gt; </span> as a light shining in a dark place <a id="l4450"></a>untill they begin to understand it. For no prophesy, saith he, is of the <a id="l4451"></a>Prophets own interpretation: the Prophets of old spake not by their <a id="l4452"></a>own will but as they were moved by the spirit &amp; therefore the <a id="l4453"></a>churches were not to expect the interpretation from the Prophet <a id="l4454"></a>Iohn, but to study the Prophesy themselves. This is the sense of what <a id="l4455"></a>he saith in the first Chapter, &amp; then in the second he goes on to describe out <a id="l4456"></a>of this sure word of prophesy how there should come fals Prophets or false <a id="l4457"></a>teachers in the Church [collectively the fals Prophet] who should deny the Lord <a id="l4458"></a>that bought them [the Character of Antichrist] &amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> many shall follow their <a id="l4459"></a><sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> lasciviousness [with the great whore] by reason of whom the way of truth shall <a id="l4460"></a>be <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup> blasphemed [for the Beast blasphemes God &amp; them that dwell in heaven <a id="l4461"></a>&amp; is full of blasphemy] &amp; through covetousness shall they with feigned words <a id="l4462"></a><sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup> make merchandise of Christians [being the merchants of Babylon whose mer<a id="l4463"></a>chandise is the  goods &amp; bodies &amp; souls of men] whose <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup> judgment &amp; damnation linger<a id="l4464"></a>eth not but shall come upon them at the last day suddenly as the flood upon <a id="l4465"></a>the old world &amp; fire &amp; brimstone upon Sodom &amp; Gomorrha,  For the Lord knoweth how to reserve the unjust to <a id="l4467"></a>the day of judgment to be punished [in the Lake of fire] but chiefly them <a id="l4468"></a>that <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n26-ref">[26]</sup> walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness &amp; despise dominion <a id="l4469"></a>&amp; <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n27-ref">[27]</sup> blaspheme glories.

Thus does the author of this Epistle spend <a id="l4480"></a>all the second chapter in describing the qualities of the Apocalyptic <a id="l4481"></a>Beasts &amp; Fals Prophets, &amp; then in the third he goes on to describe their <a id="l4482"></a>destruction more fully &amp; the future kingdom. He saith that because the <a id="l4483"></a>coming of Christ should be long deferred, they should scoff saying, Where <a id="l4484"></a>is the promiss of his coming. Then he describes the sudden coming of the <a id="l4485"></a>day of the Lord upon them <em class="underline">as a thief in the night</em> (for that's the Apocalyptic <a id="l4486"></a>phrase) &amp; the millennium or <em class="underline">thousand years</em> which are with God but as a <a id="l4487"></a>day &amp; the <em class="underline">passing away of the old heaven</em> &amp; earth by a conflagration in <a id="l4488"></a>the lake of fire, &amp;  the promise of <em class="underline">a new heaven &amp; new earth</em> <a id="l4489"></a>wherein dwelleth righteousness.</p>
<p id="par298">After the writing of the Apocalyps the Apostle Iohn governed <a id="l4490"></a>the Churches of Asia above 30 years dying in the second year of Trajan <a id="l4491"></a>A.C. 99. And about eight years after, Simeon the son of Cleopas &amp;  <a id="l4492"></a>bishop of Ierusalem was martyred being  120 years. Hitherto as Hegesippus <a id="l4493"></a>testifies the Church was accounted a virgin,  all heresies being  <a id="l4494"></a>kept under by the authority of Iohn &amp; Simeon who had conversed with <a id="l4495"></a>Christ: but after their death the Hereticks began to be more bold &amp; make more disciples &amp; give the Churches more disturbance then before.</p>
