<p id="par1">When Ioshua conquered Canaan great numbers of the <a id="l3"></a>Cananites fled into Egypt &amp;  in time diffused themselves from thence into all <a id="l5"></a>Afric as far as the Pillars of Hercules: as Procopius<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> thus men<a id="l6"></a>tions. Phœnices cum  inexpugnabilum conspicerent advenarum <a id="l7"></a>exercitum, patrios fines deserentes in Ægyptum vicinam <a id="l8"></a>migrarunt, ibique numero ac sobole crescentes cum non satis <a id="l9"></a>commodum tantæ multitudini locum invenissent in Africam <a id="l10"></a>penetravere ubi civitates quamplures habitantes omnem eum <a id="l11"></a>tractum usque ad Herculis columnas tenuerunt semiphœnicia <a id="l12"></a>lingua et catalecto utentes, oppidumque Tingen situ muni<a id="l13"></a>tissimum in Numidia ædifacerunt, ubi duæ ex albo lapide <a id="l14"></a>columnæ prope magnum fontem constitutæ, in quibus Phœnicum lingua <a id="l15"></a>litteræ incisæ sunt hujusmodi. Nos a facie fugimus Iesu <a id="l16"></a>prædonis filij Nave. Hi demum quod nulli sint eis antiqui<a id="l17"></a>ores Aphricæ indignæ dicuntur esse. And to the same purpose <a id="l18"></a>Eusebius<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> tells us that the Canaanites flying from the face of the sons <a id="l19"></a>of Israel built. Tripolis in Africa. And the Ierusalem Gemara <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> that the Gergesites fled from Ioshua going into Afric. The manner of their coming <a id="l20"></a>into Egypt is thus described by Manetho the Egyptian d<sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> the second book of his <a id="l21"></a>history of Egypt.</p>
<p id="par2">We had a king called Timaus in whose reign there came <a id="l22"></a>unexpectedly from the east an ignoble sort of men who confi<a id="l23"></a>dently pitched their tents in our country, &amp; by their strength easily seized  <a id="l24"></a>it without war, &amp; gaining the  governours of the <a id="l25"></a>country to their side, afterwards cruelly burnt the cities <a id="l26"></a>&amp; subverted the temples of the Gods, &amp; carried themselves <a id="l27"></a>in a most hostile manner towards all the natives killing <a id="l28"></a>some of them &amp; reducing the children &amp; wives of others <a id="l29"></a>into servitude, &amp; in conclusion made one of their numbers <a id="l30"></a>called Salatis their king; &amp; he coming to Memphis made <a id="l31"></a>the regions above &amp; below tributary leaving garrisons in <a id="l32"></a>convenient places. – – – And finding in the Nome or Province <a id="l33"></a>of Sais a very convenient city on the eastern side of the Bu<a id="l34"></a>bastic stream of the Nile, which was called Abaris, he built <a id="l35"></a>this &amp; fortified it  very strongly with walls, placing <a id="l36"></a>there an armed multitude to the number of 240000 men for its <a id="l37"></a>custody. And after him reigned Bæon, Apagnas, Apophis, Janias &amp; <a id="l38"></a>Assis successively..  These were their first six kings, who were always con<a id="l39"></a>quering &amp; endeavouring to cut up the root of Egypt. They were <a id="l40"></a>called Hicsos, that is, shepherd Kings. For Hic in the sacred language <a id="l41"></a>signifies a king &amp; sos in the vulgar language a shepherd. They &amp; <a id="l42"></a>their successors obteined Egypt 511 years, &amp; then  this kingdom of shepherds was <a id="l43"></a>invaded by the kings of Thebais &amp; the rest of Egypt who made a <a id="l44"></a>very great &amp; lasting war upon them, &amp; under their kings Alisphrag<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span>muthosis or Misphragmuthosis &amp; his son Tethmosis or Amosis drove <a id="l45"></a>them out of Egypt.  First Misphragmuthosis king of Thebais drove them out of a <a id="l46"></a>part of Egypt &amp;  forced them to fortify <a id="l47"></a>themselves in the kingdom of Abaris which was ten thousand Aruras in compass. Then Amosis his son <a id="l48"></a>made fresh war upon them &amp; when he could not force them <a id="l49"></a>he covenanted with them that they should retire  out of Egypt quietly &amp; go whether they pleased. <a id="l51"></a>Whereupon they went with their families &amp; possessions to the <a id="l52"></a>number of 240000, out of Egypt through the wilderness into <a id="l53"></a>syria &amp; seating themselves in Iudea built there a city which <a id="l54"></a>might be sufficient for their number, &amp; called it Ierusalem. <a id="l55"></a>And this is the account which Manetho gives of the kingdom of Shepherds.</p>
<p id="par3">Here  Manetho takes these shepherd to be the Israelites who <a id="l56"></a>built Ierusalem, but he tells us that some  took them <a id="l57"></a>for Arabians. Africans speaking of the first six kings saith <a id="l58"></a> more truly that they were Phœniceans. Ἠσαν δὲ <a id="l59"></a>φοίνικες ξένοι βασιλεῖς 5. Bochartus<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> makes them a colony <a id="l60"></a>of Phenicians &amp; interprets the names of the first six kings <a id="l61"></a>in the Phenician language. And Ierome saith of the language of Canaan:<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> Inter Ægyptiam et Hebræam media est et Hebrææ <a id="l62"></a>magna ex parte confinis, Its between the Egyptian &amp; Hebrew <a id="l63"></a>&amp; for the most part comes nearer to the Hebrew. Which is <a id="l64"></a>a strong argument that the Canaanites were mixt of <a id="l65"></a>people who had converst in Egypt later then the He<a id="l66"></a>brews had done &amp; by consequence that the shepherds at <a id="l67"></a>their coming out of Egypt mixt with the Canaanites rather <a id="l68"></a>then with the Hebrews. The Canaanites were shepherds &amp; <a id="l69"></a>lay next Egypt, &amp; its more likely that the Egyptian sheep<a id="l70"></a>herds would go to a nation of their one language &amp; profession <a id="l71"></a>&amp; kindred &amp;  which lay nearest to them, then to a remoter nation of a strange <a id="l72"></a>language.</p>
<p id="par4">Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> tells us that a region in Memphys round <a id="l73"></a>the Temple of Proteus was inhabited by Tyrian Phenicians <a id="l74"></a>all which place was called the camp of the Tyrians. Probably <a id="l75"></a>these were the reliques of the shepherds. He tells us <a id="l76"></a>also<sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup>  of a city in the Delta called Aterbechis in <a id="l77"></a>which was a temple of Venus; &amp; by the name of the city <a id="l78"></a>this Venus seems to be the Venus of the Phenicians <a id="l79"></a>called Atargatis. The name is corruptly formed of <a id="l80"></a>Aster-dag, &amp; signifies a Queen of Sheepherds heards<a id="l81"></a>men &amp; mariners, the word <em class="underline">Aster</em> &amp; in the plural <a id="l82"></a>number Asteroth signifying heards of cattel &amp; flocks <a id="l83"></a>of sheep &amp; the word <em class="underline">dag</em> a  fish. As a Queen of <a id="l84"></a>sheepherds &amp; heardsmen she ware upon her head the head <a id="l85"></a>of an Ox (or diadem so formed) &amp; was called Asteroth &amp; <a id="l86"></a>corruptly Astarte &amp; Athara, &amp; as a Queen of Mariners  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> she was sometimes formed like a fish below &amp; then called <a id="l87"></a>Atargatis &amp; corruptly Derceto, &amp; here in Herodotus.<sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> Atar<a id="l88"></a>bechis. When any bulls died in Egypt it was the custome <a id="l89"></a>of the Egyptians to bury them neare their cities with <a id="l90"></a>one of their horns above grownd for a signe, &amp; after a <a id="l91"></a>certain time when their bodies were rotted away the <a id="l92"></a>inhabitants of this city Atarbechis came to the cities <a id="l93"></a>of Egypt in ships, dug up the bones, carried them ~ <a id="l94"></a>away to a common burying place &amp; there buried them <a id="l95"></a>together. This service imposed by the Egyptians <a id="l96"></a>upon the inhabitants of this city implies that they <a id="l97"></a>were the remains of ancient heardsmen who had <a id="l98"></a>left a brood of cattel scattered over the land of Egypt, <a id="l99"></a>&amp; their Goddess Aterbechis after whom (according to <a id="l100"></a>the custome of the Egyptians who named their cities <a id="l101"></a>from their Gods) the city seems to be named, im<a id="l102"></a>plies that they were Phenicians.</p>
<p id="par5">These shepherds while they reigned in Egypt <a id="l103"></a>sacrificed men  like the Phenicians, &amp; in <a id="l104"></a>Busiris a city in the middle of the Delta the Egyptians <a id="l105"></a>long after the expulsion of the shepherds continued <a id="l106"></a>to beat themselves in their worship &amp; some cut their <a id="l107"></a>foreheads after the manner of the Priests of Baal<sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> <a id="l108"></a>the God of the Zidonians. At the tomb    or temple of <a id="l109"></a>Osiris they sacrificed red men<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> because Typhon was <a id="l110"></a>red, &amp; few Egyptians being found of that colour they <a id="l111"></a>sacrificed strangers. In Heliopolis they sacrificed three <a id="l112"></a>men daily to Iuno<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> till  Amosis having taken that city <a id="l113"></a>from them abolished those sacrifices by substituting waxen <a id="l114"></a>images of men. And therefore they reigned over Heli<a id="l115"></a>opolis, &amp; by consequence over a great part of the lower <a id="l116"></a>Egypt till after the days of Misphragmuthosis.</p>
<p id="par6">Diodorus in his 40<sup>th</sup> Book saith<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> that in Egypt there <a id="l117"></a>were formerly multitudes of strangers of several nations <a id="l118"></a>who used forreign rites &amp; ceremonies in worshipping <a id="l119"></a>the Gods; for which they were expelled Egypt, &amp; under <a id="l120"></a>Danaus Cadmus &amp; other skilfull commanders after <a id="l121"></a>great hardships came into Greece &amp; other places, but <a id="l122"></a>the greatest part of them came into Iudea not far <a id="l123"></a>from Egypt, a country then uninhabited &amp; desart, <a id="l124"></a>being conducted thether by one Moses a wise &amp; valiant <a id="l125"></a>man, who after he had possest himself of the country, <a id="l126"></a>among other cities built Ierusalem &amp; the Temple. Dio<a id="l127"></a> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span>dorus here mistakes the original of the  Israelites as <a id="l128"></a>Manetho had done before, confounding their flight  into <a id="l129"></a>the Wilderness under the conduct of Moses, with the flight <a id="l130"></a>of the shepherds into Phœnicia. But however he let <a id="l131"></a>us know that the shepherds were expelled Egypt a <a id="l132"></a>little before the building of Ierusalem &amp; the Temple <a id="l133"></a>&amp; that after several hardships some of them came into <a id="l134"></a>Greece &amp; other places under the conduct of Cadmus <a id="l135"></a>&amp; other Captains, but the most of them settled in <a id="l136"></a>Phœnicia next Egypt. We may reccon therefore that <a id="l137"></a>the wars between the king of Thebais &amp; the Shepherds <a id="l138"></a>were the  occasion that the Philistims were so numerous in the days of Saul &amp; that so many men came with <a id="l139"></a>colonies out of Egypt &amp; Phenicia into Greece as Cecrops, <a id="l140"></a>
Lelex, Inachus, Pelasgus Cadmus, Phineus, Membliarius, Alymnus, Erechtheus, Peteos, &amp; that these <a id="l141"></a>things happened in the reign of Eli Samuel &amp; David;  Cecrops, Lelex, Inachus &amp; <a id="l142"></a>Pelasgus being contemporary to Eli, &amp; Cadmus Membliarius Alymnus Erech<a id="l143"></a>theus &amp; Phorbas  to David as was shewed above.</p>
<p id="par7">Iustin Martyr<sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> tells us that Apion the  <a id="l144"></a>son of Possidonius in his commentary against the Iews, &amp; in <a id="l145"></a>hos fourth book of histories, saith that when Inachus reigned <a id="l146"></a>at Argos the Iews under the conduct of Moses (he means the <a id="l147"></a>Shepherds) departed from Amasis king of Egypt, &amp; that the <a id="l148"></a>same thing is reported by Ptolomy the Mendesian an Egyptian <a id="l149"></a>Priest who wrote the affairs of Egypt, &amp; by Hellanicus &amp; Philocorus <a id="l150"></a>who wrote the acts of the Athenians, &amp; by Castor &amp; Thallus <a id="l151"></a> &amp; Alexander Polyhistor.  Whence Tatian &amp; Clemens out of <a id="l152"></a>ancient authors make Inachus contempory to Moses. But  <a id="l153"></a> Polemo in <a id="l154"></a>the first book of his Greek histories saith that in the time of <a id="l155"></a>Apis the son of Phoroneus part of the Egyptian army withdrew <a id="l156"></a>it self from Egypt &amp; seated it self in Palestine not far from <a id="l157"></a>Arabia, that is, the army of the Shepherds withdrew it self <a id="l158"></a>from Abaris by the compact made with Amosis. The wars <a id="l159"></a>between the kings of Thebais &amp; the Shepherds being lasting <a id="l160"></a>some of the Shepherds fled out of Egypt into Greece &amp; other <a id="l161"></a>places in the days of Inachus &amp; at length the main army re<a id="l162"></a>tired into Phenicia in the days of Apis the son of Phoroneus, <a id="l163"></a>&amp; after many hardships endured in Phenicia, some of the army <a id="l164"></a>came with Cadmus &amp; his companions into Greece. Whence <a id="l165"></a>I seem to gather that Misphragmuthosis drave them out <a id="l166"></a>of all Egypt above Memphys &amp; perhaps  out of some part of Egypt below <a id="l167"></a>it, in the days of Eli when Inachus Lelex Pelasgus &amp; Cecrops came into <a id="l168"></a>Greece, &amp; that Amosis  caused the rest of their army to <a id="l169"></a>retire into Phenicia in the days of Samuel, where they endured <a id="l170"></a>great hardships by the want of provisions &amp; by the wars which <a id="l171"></a>Saul &amp; David made upon them, until David  by his victories <a id="l172"></a>forced great numbers of them to seek new seats under the <a id="l173"></a>conduct of Cadmus &amp; other Captains.</p>
<p id="par8">The retiring of the Shepherds out of Egypt  augmenting <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> the armies &amp; strength of the Philistims &amp; making them too nu<a id="l174"></a>merous for their country, seems to have given occasion to the <a id="l175"></a>great wars which they made upon Israel in the days of Eli, Samuel <a id="l176"></a>Saul &amp; David. For they conquered Israel &amp; reigned over <a id="l177"></a>them 40 years untill Samuel in the 20<sup>th</sup> year of his <a id="l178"></a>reign beat them in a great battel &amp; subdued them &amp; took from <a id="l179"></a>them the cities which they had taken from Israel &amp; delivered <a id="l180"></a>coasts of Israel out of their hand so that they came no <a id="l181"></a>more into the coast of Israel. For the hand of the Lord was <a id="l182"></a>against the Philistims all the days of Samuel,  (1 Sam. 7.) <a id="l183"></a>that is, untill the reign of Saul. The Philistims therefore <a id="l184"></a>conquered Israel about the middle of the reign of Eli; about <a id="l185"></a>which time Inachus, Lelex, Cecrops, Pelasgus &amp; their companions <a id="l186"></a>fled from Egypt into Greece as we shewed above. And again <a id="l187"></a>in the beginning of the reign of Saul or the year before, they <a id="l188"></a>conquered Israel  a second time &amp; reduced them to such a degree of <a id="l189"></a>subjection that there   was no smith found in all Israel: <a id="l190"></a> for the Philistims said, Least the Hebrews <a id="l191"></a>should make them swords &amp; spears. And  now the army of the Philistims consisted of thirty <a id="l193"></a>thousand chariots &amp; six thousand horsmen &amp; foot as the sand <a id="l194"></a>which is on the sea shore in multitude. Which  innumerable <a id="l195"></a>multitude being too great to be composed of the Philistims alone <a id="l196"></a>without the access of the Shepherds from Egypt: it seems to <a id="l197"></a>me that the army of the Shepherds made peace with Amosis <a id="l198"></a>&amp; quitted Egypt upon a prospect of joyning with the Philistims <a id="l199"></a>to conquer Palestine, &amp; that from this conjunction ensued all <a id="l200"></a>that vehement war with Saul &amp; David untill after many <a id="l201"></a>battels they were subdued by David  &amp; for want of room were <a id="l204"></a>forced to apply themselves to sea affairs &amp; in great num<a id="l205"></a>bers to seek new seats in Asia minor Greece &amp; Afric, as <a id="l206"></a>has been explained above.</p>
<p id="par9">When the Philistims strengthned by the access of the <a id="l207"></a>Shepherds were in their greatest power they beseiged &amp; took <a id="l208"></a>Zidon &amp; thereby gave occasion to the building of Tyre &amp; Aradus as <a id="l209"></a>Trogus in his 18<sup>th</sup> book thus mentions. <em class="underline">A rege Ascaloniorum <a id="l210"></a>expugnati Sidonij navibus appulsi Tyrum urbem ante annum <a id="l211"></a>Trojanæ cladis condiderunt</em>.  And Strabo (l. 16) Aradus was built by men who fled from Sidon.  Hence Isaiah calls Tyre the daughter of <a id="l213"></a>Zidon, the inhabitants of the Isle whom the Merchants of Zidon <a id="l214"></a>have replenished. This original of Tyre I understand not of <a id="l215"></a>the first building of the town which Iosephus saith was 240 <a id="l216"></a>years before the building of Solomons Temple, but of the <a id="l217"></a>making it a populous trading city like that of Zidon &amp; <a id="l218"></a>building it accordingly. For the Zidonians built it for that <a id="l219"></a>purpose. And this seems to have been in the days of Abiba<a id="l220"></a>lus &amp; his son Hiram the two first kings of Tyre named in <a id="l221"></a>history. For Iosephus<sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> tells us out of Menander &amp; Dius, that <a id="l222"></a>Hiram king of Tyre succeeding his father Abibus, added a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> large region to the Island eastward by heaping up earth &amp; <a id="l223"></a>built the city greater &amp; the Temple of Iupiter Olympus <a id="l224"></a>which was in the Island he joyned to the city by a ridge of <a id="l225"></a>earth thrown between them, &amp; adorned the Temple with <a id="l226"></a>gifts of gold, &amp; demolishing the old Temples built new ones <a id="l227"></a>&amp; dedicated the Temples of Hercules &amp; Astartes. Kings <a id="l228"></a>upon founding or much enlarging their kingdoms usually <a id="l229"></a>build their cities more sumptuously as David &amp; Solomon <a id="l230"></a>did Ierusalem &amp; the Temple, Sesostris the cities &amp; <a id="l231"></a>temples of Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar the city of Ba<a id="l232"></a>bylon, Dejoces Ecbatane, &amp; Augustus Rome; &amp; according<a id="l233"></a>ly the building of Tyre by Hiram argues a new domi<a id="l234"></a>nion of the Tyrians. Now that this was the building <a id="l235"></a>of Tyre mentioned by Trogus, may be concluded <a id="l236"></a>from hence, that Solomon in the beginning of <a id="l237"></a>his reign called the servants of Hiram Zidonians. <a id="l238"></a><em class="underline">My servants</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">shall be with thy servants, <a id="l239"></a>&amp; unto thee will I give hire for thy servants <a id="l240"></a>according to all that thou desirest, for thou know<a id="l241"></a>est that there is not amongst us any that can skill <a id="l242"></a>to hew timber like unto the Zidonians</em>. 1 King. 5.6 <a id="l243"></a>The new inhabitants of Tyre had not yet lost the <a id="l244"></a>name of Zidonians, nor had the old inhabitants <a id="l245"></a>(if there were any considerable number of them) <a id="l246"></a>gained the reputation of the new ones for skill <a id="l247"></a>in hewing of timber as they would have done had <a id="l248"></a>shipping been long in use at Tyre. We may reccon <a id="l249"></a>therefore that the king of Ascalon (one of the <a id="l250"></a>five Lords of the Philistims) took Zidon  neare the <a id="l251"></a>beginning of the reign of David or not long before. <a id="l252"></a>For then were the Philistims most potent &amp; active <a id="l253"></a>in invading their neighbours &amp; propagating their <a id="l254"></a>dominion. And from the hostility between the Phi<a id="l255"></a>listims &amp; Zidonians it seems to have happened that <a id="l256"></a>David had friendship with the king of Tyre while <a id="l257"></a>he made war upon the Philistims, &amp; that the  Ty<a id="l258"></a>rians traded with Solomon upon the red Sea while the <a id="l259"></a>Zidonians traded apart upon the Mediterranean. So then <a id="l260"></a>Ierusalem &amp; Tyre were built about the same time <a id="l261"></a>as head cities of new kingdoms, &amp; thence forward <a id="l262"></a>continued in a flourishing condition untill Nebuchad<a id="l263"></a>nezzar beseiged &amp; took them.   And Aradus Arvad or Arpad continued under its own kings till it was conquered by the king of Assyria</p>

<p id="par10">When David<sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup> smote Hadad-ezer king of Zobah &amp; slew <a id="l264"></a>the Syrians of Damascus who came to assist him Rezon fled <a id="l265"></a>from his lord Hadad-ezer &amp; gathering a band of men became <a id="l266"></a>their captain &amp; reigned in Damascus over Syria.

<p id="par11">When David smote  Edom, Ioab staid there with <a id="l281"></a>all Israel six months untill he had smitten every male <a id="l282"></a>in Edom 1 King. 11.15, 16. This made Hadad the young king of <a id="l283"></a>Edom fly into Egypt with certain Edomites his fathers servants; <a id="l284"></a>&amp; as many others of the Edomites as could escape fled to the Philis<a id="l285"></a>tims &amp; to Sidon &amp; other places where they could be protected. <a id="l286"></a>For Stephanus in Azot tells us: ταύτυν ἔκτισαν εἷς τῶν <a id="l287"></a>ἐπανελθόντων ἀπ' Ερυθρᾶς Θαλάσσης φευγάδων <em class="underline">A <a id="l288"></a>fugitive or exul from the red sea built Arot or Ashdod</em>. <a id="l289"></a>That is, a fugitive Prince of Edom fortified it against <a id="l290"></a>the Israelites. By this victory over the Edomites, Ezion <a id="l291"></a>Gebar &amp; Eloth (sea ports of the Edomites on the Red Sea) <a id="l292"></a>came into the hands of David &amp; his successors. And Solomon<sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup> <a id="l293"></a>built a navy in Ezion Gebar &amp; sent it on the Red Sea <a id="l294"></a>with the fleet of Hiram king of Tyre to Tarshish &amp; <a id="l295"></a>Ophir for gold &amp; silver &amp; ivory &amp; Peacocks [or Parrots] <a id="l296"></a>&amp; Apes &amp; pretious stones &amp; Almug trees; by which means <a id="l297"></a>the Queen of Sheba or Sabea in Arabia Felix heard of <a id="l298"></a>Solomon's  glory; &amp; Hiram sent with Solomon's servants <a id="l299"></a>in Solomons navy his own servants shipmen who had <a id="l300"></a>knowledge of the sea. Solomon's servants were there<a id="l301"></a>fore novices in sea affairs &amp; Hiram's servants were <a id="l302"></a>experienced shipmen who had knowledge of those seas <a id="l303"></a>by former voyages, for Hiram had also a Navy on the <a id="l304"></a>Red Sea 1 King. 10.11, 22.  This fleet traded <a id="l305"></a>upon all the  Erythræan sea going as far as the Persian  <a id="l306"></a>gulf &amp; the coasts adjoyning. For one of the Islands in the  Arabic gulf was called Astarte, that name being given it by the Phenicians, &amp; Strabo<sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup> tells us from ancient authors <a id="l307"></a>that neare the mouth of the Persian gulf were two Islands called <a id="l308"></a>Tyrus &amp; Aradus which had Temples like the Phenician &amp; whose in<a id="l309"></a>habitants affirmed that the cities of Phœnicia of the same name <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> were their colonies. Hence came the opinion of the Persians <a id="l310"></a>mentioned in Herodotus, that the Phœnicians  came <a id="l311"></a>from the red sea; whereas its much more probable that those <a id="l312"></a>Islands  were colonies of the Phenicians <a id="l313"></a>&amp; had their names from the cities Tyre &amp; Aradus in Pheni<a id="l314"></a>cia.</p>
<p id="par12">The Red Sea being very shallow &amp; for that reason <a id="l315"></a>calmer then the Mediterranean was navigable in smaller <a id="l316"></a>vessels such as men could make in the beginning. And <a id="l317"></a>the short voyages between the many Islands with which <a id="l318"></a>that sea abounded, were an invitation to try that sea <a id="l319"></a>first. There navigation had its rise &amp;  from thence it <a id="l320"></a>came to the mediterranean. For Pliny<sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> tells us: <em class="underline">Nave <a id="l321"></a>primus in Græcian ex Ægypto Danaus advenit; ante <a id="l322"></a>ratibus navigabatur inventis in mari rubro inter in<a id="l323"></a>sulas a rege Eythra</em>. And Stephanus,<sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> that this sea <a id="l324"></a>was called Erythra from Erythra the Hero. And Strabo,<sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup> <a id="l325"></a>that on the coast of Carmania southward in the open sea was <a id="l326"></a>the island Tyrrhina (he means Ormus) in which was the sepulchre of Erythra, being <a id="l327"></a>a great heap of earth planted with palm trees &amp; that Ery<a id="l328"></a>thra reigned in those parts &amp; left his name to that sea. But <a id="l329"></a>Erythra is a Greek word of the same signification with Edom <a id="l330"></a>in Hebrew &amp; red in English, &amp; therefore king Erythra is usually <a id="l331"></a>taken for Edom or Esau. Certainly the red sea, the <a id="l332"></a>Eythrean sea &amp; the sea of Edom are phrases of the <a id="l333"></a>same signification &amp; the inhabitants of that sea or people <a id="l334"></a>of Edom are by the Greeks called Erythreans &amp; had their <a id="l335"></a>name originally from Edom or Esau, &amp; being driven from that <a id="l336"></a>sea by David &amp; his successors mixed with the Phenicians and <a id="l337"></a>traded  upon the Mediterranean &amp; then built several cities <a id="l338"></a>called Erythrean by the Greeks. For Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup> tells us that <a id="l339"></a>the Gephyræans were Phenicians who came with Cadmus into <a id="l340"></a>Bœtia &amp; affirmed  of themselves that they were ori<a id="l341"></a>ginally from Erethria, &amp; Stephanus<sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup> that Erethra was the <a id="l342"></a>name of a city in Ionia, of another in Libya of another <a id="l343"></a>in Locris, of another in Bœotia &amp; of another in Cyprus. Ery<a id="l344"></a>thræ in Ionia was a seaport town &amp; a colony of forreigners.<sup class="note" id="n26-ref">[26]</sup> <a id="l345"></a>The inhabitants said that they came from Crete under the <a id="l346"></a>conduct of Eythrus the son of Rhadamanthus; but their <a id="l347"></a>God was Phenician.
