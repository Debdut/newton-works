    <p id="par2" class="i0">May it please your Lordships <br><br></p>
    
    <p id="par3"><span class="large">In</span> obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference signified to us 
        <a id="l1"></a>by M<sup>r</sup> Lowndes we have considered the Memorial of the Chancellour of 
        <a id="l2"></a>Ireland about erecting a Mint in that kingdom with the Report of the 
        <a id="l3"></a>late Warden &amp; Master &amp; the other Papers accompanying them, and by <a id="l4"></a>those Papers we find that the Officers of the Mint have long been <a id="l5"></a>cautious in this matter. For in a Report made by them about 39 <a id="l6"></a>years ago they use these words. "It hath been, say they, the policy &amp; <a id="l7"></a>caution of King's &amp; Queens of England to stock their Realm of Ireland <a id="l8"></a>with monies (both for quantity and quality) coyned in their Mint in the <a id="l9"></a>Tower of London whereof one part yet retains the name of the <a id="l10"></a>Irish Mint; and King Iames (of happy memory) by his Indenture <a id="l11"></a>of the Mint caused his Moneys stampt for Ireland to be charged <a id="l12"></a>with an Harp crowned for distinctions sake whose Reasons and <a id="l13"></a>examples (as we submissively conceive) may well admit your Lordships <a id="l14"></a>first consideration.<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>"<span class="nb-n">}</span></span></p>
    
    <p id="par4">We understand also that the late Warden &amp; Master in their <a id="l15"></a>Report  were the more cautious by reason of a designe then <a id="l16"></a>on foot of perswading the people of Ireland that their Parliament <a id="l17"></a>&amp; government ought not to be subordinate to that of England.</p>
    
    <p id="par5">And we do not see but that the Government of England has ever been cautious <a id="l18"></a>in this matter For tho a Mint in Ireland may have been upon several occasions much <a id="l19"></a>desired yet it has either not been granted or not suffered to continue. <a id="l20"></a>Among the Papers above mentioned we find a Warrant for erecting <a id="l21"></a>such a mint soon after the restauration of King Charles the second but <a id="l22"></a>the designe is not yet put in execution.</p>
    
    <p id="par6">Yet a Mint for coyning English money there may tend to encrease the species if care be <a id="l24"></a>first taken by due laws as in England to prevent the melting it down for the Indies or otherwise <a id="l25"></a>exporting it. For if his Majesty upon comparing the reasons on both sides (some of which are above our judgment) shall please that a Mint be erected in Ireland, we are humbly <a id="l26"></a>of opinion (for the reasons of  our Predecessors in the Papers commu<a id="l27"></a>nicated to us) that the monies coyned there should be of the same weight <a id="l28"></a>allay species &amp; stamp or impression with the monies of England, adding <a id="l29"></a>only such a mark of distinction as his Majesty shall think fit &amp; that <a id="l30"></a>the mint be under the same rules &amp; laws with this in the Tower <a id="l31"></a>but with such retrenchments of salaries &amp; Officers as may conveniently <a id="l32"></a>be made; and that the same valuation of the moneys &amp; same proportion <a id="l33"></a>of gold to silver be observed in both nations. And we are ready to pro<a id="l34"></a>mote the setting up of such a Mint after the best manner and particularly 
        
        <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p213r"> &lt;213r&gt; </span>
        
        to supply them with standard weights, Trial pieces, Dyes &amp; Coyning Tools <a id="l35"></a>&amp; to try their money &amp; instruct their Officers at their first setting out <a id="l36"></a>But if a standing Mint should be desired for coyning from time to time <a id="l37"></a>the Bullion of Merchants &amp; others (as the words of the Memorial may <a id="l38"></a>import) we believe it may put Ireland to a greater charge then to <a id="l39"></a>coyn such Bullion in London, by means of an Exchange at Dublin.</p>
    
    <p id="par7">Vpon enquiring into the state of the Coyn in Ireland we understand <a id="l40"></a>that the forreign coyns which make a great part of their silver moneys are <a id="l41"></a>generally in great pieces (as Ducatons &amp; Pieces of eight) which are inconve<a id="l42"></a>nient for change &amp; that the want of smaller silver monies has incouraged <a id="l43"></a>the coyning of so great quantities of copper monies for change as to be <a id="l44"></a>complained of: and if for remedying this inconvenience a Mint be desired <a id="l45"></a>to coyn those forreign monies or any part of them into small English <a id="l46"></a>money (shillings &amp; sixpences) we believe it may be  cheapest &amp; best <a id="l47"></a>for Ireland &amp; safest for England to have this coynage dispatcht at once <a id="l48"></a>by erecting a Mint in Ireland for some short time (as eighteen months <a id="l49"></a>or two years) &amp; by lowering the value of the forreign monies to bring <a id="l50"></a>them into that Mint. But we humbly lay before your Lordships that the <a id="l51"></a>late Country Mints were in disorder &amp; left their Accompts full of <a id="l52"></a>difficulties &amp; that the breaking up of such a Mint may increase the <a id="l53"></a>number of false coyners. And we heare that the English money <a id="l54"></a>is now grown much more plentifull in Ireland in proportion to the <a id="l55"></a>forreign then it was a few years ago so that the want of change is <a id="l56"></a>in good measure vanishedg &amp; is still decreasing, the forreign monies having <a id="l57"></a>lately found a good market in London for the East Indies.</p>
    
    <p id="par8">If the Government of Ireland shall think fit to discourage the <a id="l58"></a>exportation of English money by setting a value something lower upon <a id="l59"></a>the forreign so that when Merchants or others have occasion to export gold or <a id="l60"></a>silver they may chuse rather to export the forreign monies then the <a id="l61"></a>English it will much promote the encrease of the English moneys in <a id="l62"></a>Ireland. A difference of one or two per cent in the value of the monies <a id="l63"></a>may be sufficient for this purpose, &amp; will mend the exchange to the <a id="l64"></a>profit of Ireland without hindring the importation of the monies of Spain <a id="l65"></a>&amp; Flanders into that Kingdome by trade. And if the exportation of the <a id="l66"></a>English money were prohibited by the same laws in Ireland as in England <a id="l67"></a>it would still conduce to the same end</p>
    
    <p id="par9">Also if shillings &amp; sixpences were for a while raised a farthing <a id="l68"></a>in the shilling without raising the greater money it would increase those <a id="l69"></a>smaller species of money at a less charge then by a new Mint. Or they may <a id="l70"></a>be increased by returns from England of small money for great.</p>
    
    <p id="par10">But if a new Mint be judged the fittest expedient, we believe the <a id="l71"></a>directions in the Warrant of 14 Car. II amongst the Papers referred to us <a id="l72"></a>may be proper for such a purpose if applied &amp; restrained to the present <a id="l73"></a>way of coyning by the Mill &amp; Press without a seigniorage &amp; without the <a id="l74"></a>penalty of Fine &amp; Ransome upon two penny weight remedy in the single <a id="l75"></a>pieces &amp; with the trial of their Pix by the Assaymaster &amp; Weigher &amp;

    <p id="par11">There are many Mints in France &amp; have divers in England <a id="l77"></a>and if his Majesty should think fit to set up a new one any where  for furnishing both Ireland and the Plantations with  <a id="l79"></a>silver &amp; brass money of the English standard without any dependence on the <a id="l80"></a>Mint in the Tower except for the trial of the monies &amp; the stamps, it might <a id="l81"></a>put an end to the Projections  which are dayly on foot for making great <a id="l82"></a>advantage by coyning money for the Plantations of other Standards then <a id="l83"></a>the English &amp; without due intrinsic value.</p>

    <p id="par22">And  we do not <a id="l142"></a>see but that the Government of England has even been cautious in this matter <a id="l143"></a>For tho a Mint in Ireland may have been upon several occasions much de<a id="l144"></a>sired yet it has either not been granted or not suffered to continue.   <a id="l147"></a> Among the Papers above mentioned we find a Warrant <a id="l148"></a>for erecting such a Mint  soon after the restauration of King Charles II <a id="l149"></a>but the designe is not yet put in execution.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="par24">But if it shall be his Majestys pleasure that a Mint be erected <a id="l152"></a>in that Kingdom (for the determination depends upon some for increasing  considerations which we reccon above us) we are humbly of opinion in <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>consideration<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 3 characters)">{illeg}</span>  in the papers communicated to us that the monies coyned <a id="l153"></a>there should be of the same weight allay species &amp; stamp or impression  <a id="l154"></a>with the monies of England, adding only such a mark of distinction <a id="l155"></a>as his Majesty shall think fit, &amp; that the Mint be  under the <a id="l156"></a>same rules &amp; laws with this in the Tower but with  such retrenchment of salaries &amp; Officers as <a id="l158"></a>may conveniently be made &amp; that the same valuation of the money &amp; same proportion of Gold to silver be observed in both nations. And we are ready to promote the setting up such a Mint after the best manner &amp; particularly to <a id="l159"></a>supply them with Standard weight,  Trial pieces, Dyes &amp; Coyning Tools <a id="l160"></a>&amp; to try their money &amp; instruct their Officers at their first setting <a id="l161"></a>out. But if a standing Mint be desired for coyning from time to time the <a id="l162"></a>Bullion of Merchants &amp; others  (as the words of the Memorial
        
         <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p221r"> &lt;221r&gt; </span>
        
        <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>may<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> import) we  believe it may put Ireland to a greater charge then <a id="l163"></a>to coyn such Bullion in London</p>
    
    <p id="par25">Vpon inquiring into the state of the Coyn in Ireland we understand <a id="l164"></a>that the forreign coyns which make a great part of their silver monies <a id="l165"></a>are generally in great pieces (as Ducatoons &amp; pieces of eight<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>)<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> which are inconvenient for change  and that by the want of small silver monies <a id="l167"></a>the coyning of great quantities of Copper monies for change hath <a id="l168"></a>been so much incouraged as to be complained of, &amp; if for remedying this <a id="l169"></a>inconvenience  a Mint is be desired  to coyn  the <a id="l170"></a> forreign moneys or any part of them int small English money (shillings &amp; sixpences)  we believe it may be cheapest &amp; best for Ireland &amp; safest <a id="l172"></a>for England to have this coynage dispatcht at once by erecting a Mint in <a id="l173"></a>Ireland for some short time (as eighteen months or two years) &amp; by lowering <a id="l174"></a>the values of the forreign monies to bring them into that Mint. But we humbly <a id="l175"></a> lay before your <a id="l176"></a>Lordships that the late Country Mints were in disorder &amp; left their Accounts <a id="l177"></a>are full of difficulties &amp; that  the breaking up of such a Mint may increase the number of fals coyners  And we heare that the  English money is <a id="l178"></a>now grown much more plentifull in Ireland in proportion to the forreign then it was a <a id="l179"></a>few years ago so that the want of change is  in good measure vanished &amp; is <a id="l180"></a>still  decreasing.</p>
    
    <p id="par26">If the Government of Ireland shall think fit to discourage the exportation <a id="l181"></a>of English money  by  setting a  value something lower <a id="l182"></a>upon the forreign so that when Merchants or others have occasion to export <a id="l183"></a>Gold or silver they may chuse rather to export the forreign monies then <a id="l184"></a>the English,  it will much promote <a id="l185"></a>the increase of the English money in Ireland. A difference of one or two per <a id="l186"></a>cent  in the value of the monies may be sufficient for this <a id="l187"></a>purpose &amp; will mend the exchange to these profits of Ireland without hindring the importation of the <a id="l188"></a>monies of Spain &amp; Flanders into that kingdom by trade. And if the exportation of <a id="l189"></a>English money  were prohibited by the same laws in Ireland as in England,  it would still conduce to the same end. <a id="l191"></a></p>
    
    <p id="par27">Also if shillings &amp; sixpences were for a  while raised a farthing in the shilling without raising the greater money it would  sufficiently increase those smaller species of money <a id="l193"></a>at a less charge then a Mint would do.</p>
    
    <p id="par28">But if a new Mint be added the fittest  expedient  <a id="l195"></a>for furnishing Ireland with small moneys we believe <a id="l196"></a>the Directions in the Warrant of 14 Car II amongst the Papers referred to us, may be propoer <a id="l197"></a>for such a purpose if applied &amp; restrained to the present way of coyning  <a id="l198"></a>by the Mill &amp; Press without a Seigniorage &amp; without the penalty of fine &amp; ransome <a id="l199"></a>upon two penny weight remedy in the single pieces, &amp; with the trial of <a id="l200"></a>their Pix by the Assaymaster &amp; Weigher &amp; Teller of his Majestys Mint <a id="l201"></a>in the Tower in the presence of the Warden Master &amp; Comptroller  of <a id="l202"></a>the same Mint.</p>
        
        <p id="par29"> There are many Mints in France &amp; have been divers in <a id="l203"></a>England &amp; if his Majesty should think fir to set up a new one any where in <a id="l204"></a>England (as at Bristol or Chester) for furnishing Ireland &amp; the Plantations with  money  of the English standard without any dependence on the Mint in the Tower except for the triall

            of their moneys &amp; the stamps,  it might put an end to the  Project<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l206"></a>which are dayly on foot for  making great advantage by the coyning m<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>oney<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l207"></a>for the Plantations of the other standards then the English &amp; without due intrinsic value.  <br><br></p>
    
    <p id="par30">Yet such a Mint   for coyning <a id="l208"></a>English money there may tend to encrease the species if care by first taken by due laws <a id="l209"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>(a<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>s in England) to prevent the melting it down for the  Indies or otherwise ex<a id="l210"></a>porting it. For if his Majesty upon  the reasons on both sides (some of which <a id="l211"></a>are about our judgment) shall please that a Mint be erected in Ireland, we are <a id="l212"></a>humbly of opinion that the monies coyned there <br><br></p>
    
    <p id="par31"></p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p id="par34">  A new Mint being a thing of a public  concern I could be glad to wave any private advantage I may have by the Coynage to oblige the <a id="l213"></a>Gentlemen of Ireland  And if his Majesty <a id="l214"></a>shall think fit to order one I am ready to  contribute what I <a id="l215"></a>can to the best manner of setting up it,  as by supplying them with Dyes &amp;c <a id="l216"></a> I am satisfied that the Memorial of  my Lord Chancellour of <a id="l217"></a>Ireland was well intended, &amp; perceiving  now that a mint for two or three years to coyn <a id="l218"></a>the forreign money now iin Ireland  into shillings &amp; sixpences   is only desired, I do not see that such a coynage (if it stop there) would prejudice the  <a id="l220"></a> Trade of England or the Mint in the Tower, but the Question whether  <a id="l221"></a>a new Mint shall be erected tho  but for a year or two depends upon some  considerations  reccon above their judgment</p>
