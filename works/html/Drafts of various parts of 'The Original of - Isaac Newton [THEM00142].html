<h2 id="hd1" class="cent"><span class="large">Chap. 1. <a id="l1"></a><br>The original of Monarchies.</span></h2>
<p id="par1">The whole earth was by the first inhabitants divided <a id="l2"></a>into many coordinate governments according to the number <a id="l3"></a>of families. For when Moses had recconed up the <a id="l4"></a>posterity of Noah to the fourth generation, he adds: <a id="l5"></a><em class="underline">These are the families of the sons of Noah after <a id="l6"></a>their generations in their nations &amp; by these were the <a id="l7"></a>nations divided after the flood</em>.<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>  Which is as much as <a id="l8"></a>to say, that as Noah divided the whole earth be<a id="l9"></a>tween his three sons &amp; gave Europe to Iaphet <a id="l10"></a>Asia to Sem &amp; Africa to Ham without making any <a id="l11"></a>one Lord of the others territories: so each of these <a id="l12"></a>divided his part between his sons &amp; each of them their <a id="l13"></a>parts between theirs without making any one Lord <a id="l14"></a>of anothers inheritance till the whole earth was <a id="l15"></a>distributed into independant &amp; coordinate nations tribes <a id="l16"></a>&amp; families. For what Moses saith of the division <a id="l17"></a>of the whole earth among all the posterity of Noah, <a id="l18"></a>he saith of the division of the several parts among the <a id="l19"></a>posterity of his severall sons. For when he had <a id="l20"></a>recconned up the children &amp; grand-children of Iaphet <a id="l21"></a>he subjoyns: <em class="underline">By these were the Isles of the Gen<a id="l22"></a>tiles divided in their lands every one after his <a id="l23"></a>tongue after their families in their nations</em>. And <a id="l24"></a>so of the rest. So then upon the first plantati<a id="l25"></a>on of the earth there were no standing kingdoms. <a id="l26"></a>Every father was soveraign Lord of his own inheri<a id="l27"></a>tance during his life &amp; then the son's became  <a id="l28"></a>soveraign Lords of their several shares &amp; so on till <a id="l29"></a>the earth was planted with innumerable scattered <a id="l30"></a>families not subject to any other Lords then their <a id="l31"></a>common fathers. For I here reccon every father <a id="l32"></a>with all his posterity to be one family &amp; upon the <a id="l33"></a>fathers death to break into so many families as he <a id="l34"></a>left sons surviving him.

For in the first ages the Cities &amp; kingdoms were <a id="l66"></a>so small &amp; numerous that Abraham with 318 men <a id="l67"></a>beat four kings with their armies when they had <a id="l68"></a>newly beaten five others &amp; Moses with only 1200 men beat five Kings of Midian &amp; Ioshua overcame 31 on thewest of Iordan besides the two great Kingdoms of Sihon King of Heshbon &amp; Og the King of Bashan on the other side of the river, &amp; some other kingdoms of the Canaanites whichhe left unconquered.  <a id="l69"></a>thirty kingdoms in that small country of Canaan, <a id="l70"></a>&amp; in the twelft part thereof which was Iudahs lot, <a id="l71"></a>there were 125 Cities besides villages.</p>
<p id="par2">So Egypt after the death of Menes or Misraim <a id="l72"></a>the common father of the Eygptians be<a id="l73"></a>came divided into several kingdoms.

<p id="par3">In Syria the first kingdom of any considerable <a id="l86"></a>bigness was that of Damascus &amp; that grew great <a id="l87"></a>after the days of king David. ffor in his days <a id="l88"></a><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> Hadadezer was king of Soba a town &amp; country <a id="l89"></a>between Iudea &amp; Euphrates &amp; was confederate <a id="l90"></a>with Damascus &amp; with three other kings of Syria <a id="l91"></a>who served him &amp; had wars with Toy king of <a id="l92"></a>Hamath or Epiphania another City of Syria.

<p id="par4">In Asia minor the first kingdom of any great <a id="l96"></a>extent was the Lydian seated at Sardes, &amp; that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p094r"> &lt;94r&gt; </span> grew great only in the reign of the two last kings <a id="l97"></a>Alyatte &amp; Croesus.</p>
<p id="par5">Greece also consisted of small polities till  <a id="l98"></a>Philip of Macedon conquered them, &amp; those small po<a id="l99"></a>lities were at first much smaller. Every City was <a id="l100"></a>a distinct &amp; absolute polity (as even the word Polity (derived from πολυς a City)  <a id="l101"></a>imports) untill divers cities for strengthening themselves <a id="l102"></a>combined to set up a common king over them to ma<a id="l103"></a>nage their affairs in time of  danger, &amp; this <a id="l104"></a>king by steps got the government into his own hands. <a id="l105"></a>For this is plain by the history of the Cities of <a id="l106"></a>Attica thus set down by Thucydides.<sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup>   <em class="underline">Vnder Cecrops <a id="l107"></a></em> saith he, <em class="underline">&amp; the ancient kings untill Theseus, <a id="l108"></a>Attica always</em> κατὰ πολεις ὠκειτο, πρυτανεια <a id="l109"></a>τε ἔχουσα καὶ ἄρχοντας <em class="underline">was inhabited  City <a id="l110"></a>by City having magistrates &amp; prytanæa  <a id="l111"></a> wherein the sacred fire  was kept.

<p id="par6">So also Italy consisted anciently of many <a id="l121"></a>small dominions &amp; those arose out of smaller. <a id="l122"></a>ffor when Romulus founded Rome<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup>  the dominion <a id="l123"></a>of the Latines was but a small part of Italy &amp; yet consisted of <a id="l124"></a>30 Courts or Councils in so many towns each with <a id="l125"></a>the sacred fire  kept in the Prytanaeum or <a id="l126"></a>Court  the  Senators who met there to per<a id="l127"></a>form sacred rites after the manner of the Greeks. <a id="l128"></a>whence the Senators were called <em class="underline">curiales</em>.

<p id="par7">Had we good accounts of the earliest ages of <a id="l132"></a>the more eastern nations I doubt not but we <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p094v"> &lt;94v&gt; </span> might find the same constitution of things there. <a id="l133"></a>For all the Medes, as Herodotus tells us,<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>  after they had been conquered by the <a id="l134"></a>Assyrians &amp; recovered their liberty, lived for a while <a id="l135"></a>under their old laws without a king: &amp; then by con<a id="l136"></a>sent making Dejoces their king, he  required them to <a id="l137"></a>build him a city fit to reside in, that this being <a id="l138"></a>fortified &amp; adorned, then might have no great care <a id="l139"></a>of the rest.

Their want of a regal City shews that  <a id="l141"></a>till now there was  no kingdom of any considerable <a id="l142"></a>bigness in all Media. So Gaule &amp; Britain  till Cæsar conquered ✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the right margin &gt; </span>✝ them consisted of many little kingdoms, &amp; so did America till the Spaniards &amp; other Europeans invaded it.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 94v resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par8">So then it was not without good ground that Iustin out of Trogus <a id="l143"></a>gives this account of the original of Kingdoms. <sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> <em class="underline">Principio <a id="l144"></a>rerum, gentium nationumque imperium penes reges erat: <a id="l145"></a>quos ad fastigium hujus majestatis non ambitio popula<a id="l146"></a>ris sed spectata inter bonos moderatio prohevebat. <a id="l147"></a>Populus nullis legibus tenebatur; arbitria Principum <a id="l148"></a>pro legibus erant: Fines imperij tueri magis quàm <a id="l149"></a>proferre nos erat : <span class="large">Intra suam cuique patriam <a id="l150"></a>regna</span> <a id="l151"></a>finiebantur.

<p id="par9">To make this a little plainer, its to be considered <a id="l155"></a>that the name of kings was at first given to the <a id="l156"></a>fathers of families, &amp; that of kingdoms to their fa<a id="l157"></a>milies. For the four first ages so much celebrated <a id="l158"></a>by antiquity are the ages of the four first generati<a id="l159"></a>ons of kings. Saturn  was King in the golden age,  Iupiter <a id="l160"></a>in the silver one, &amp; his sons and grand-sons in those of <a id="l161"></a>brass and iron thô each reigned over nothing more then his ffamily. For. This Theology was Egyptian &amp; therefore <a id="l162"></a>Iupiter here in Iupiter Hammon or Ham: &amp; by conse<a id="l163"></a>quence  his father Saturn is Noah. He reigned <a id="l164"></a>in the first age till the division of the earth <a id="l165"></a>between his sons. Then reigned Iupiter Hammon <a id="l166"></a>in his own lot till the division thereof between his <a id="l167"></a>sons. Then in the third age reigned Osiris &amp; Isis with <a id="l168"></a>their  brethren in their several lots till Chus <a id="l169"></a>not content with his own inheritance invaded the inhe<a id="l170"></a>ritance of the posterity of Sem &amp;  planted his <a id="l171"></a>sons (as Bochartus has shewn)<sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup>  in several regions round <a id="l173"></a>about the Persian gulf, from the furthest part of Arabia <a id="l174"></a>felix to the furthest part of Carmania. And with this <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p095r"> &lt;95r&gt; </span> war &amp; the reign of the sons of Chus in their se<a id="l175"></a>veral territories began the iron age. Nimrod was <a id="l176"></a>at this time planted by his father in the land of <a id="l177"></a>Shinar, &amp; there saith Moses was the beginning <a id="l178"></a>of his kingdom: but not content with this country <a id="l179"></a>he went out thence into Assyria &amp; planted that land <a id="l180"></a>with his posterity, placing them in several seats which <a id="l181"></a>at length grew into great citites. Whence Assyria is called <a id="l182"></a>the land of Nimrod. Micah.5.6. And Noah divi<a id="l183"></a>ded his kingdom between his sons  Ham his king<a id="l184"></a>dom between his sons &amp; Chus his kingdom between <a id="l185"></a>his sons so doubtless the sons of Chus (Nimrod <a id="l186"></a>as well as the rest) according to the law received <a id="l187"></a>from their fathers divided their several kingdoms <a id="l188"></a>among their sons &amp; so on untill untill families <a id="l189"></a>for want of room to spread into grew into, grew into <a id="l190"></a>towns, &amp; the competition between several fami<a id="l191"></a>lies in the same town altered the law of dividing <a id="l192"></a>the inheritance equally between all the sons &amp; <a id="l193"></a>brought in the custome of giving all to the eldest <a id="l194"></a>son for preserving the family in its power &amp; <a id="l195"></a>authority. So then Nimrod or Ninus left no <a id="l196"></a>standing kingdom. Assyria like all other coun<a id="l197"></a>tries became divided among many families &amp; <a id="l198"></a>every family was a town &amp; a kingdom &amp; every <a id="l199"></a>father a king.  For Resen which Nimrod built in Assyria <a id="l210"></a>neare Nineve is by Moses called a great city &amp; no doubt <a id="l211"></a>its greatness (like that of all other ancient great inland Cities) <a id="l212"></a>arose from its  dominion  in the first ages,  till Nineve subdued it <a id="l215"></a> with the rest of Assyria.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p095v"> &lt;95v&gt; </span>
<p id="par10">Its true that Nimrods  kingdom was composed of  more cities then one. <a id="l216"></a>But Bochartus has shewn that the sons of Chus were planted in several regions round <a id="l217"></a>about the Persian gulf from the furthest part of Arabia felix to <a id="l218"></a>the furthest part of Carminia &amp; therefore Chus with his family  <a id="l219"></a>leaving the parts of Eygpt where they first dwelt with their father Cham, <a id="l220"></a> went into the region <a id="l221"></a>of Chaldea &amp; the Persian gulf &amp;  subduing   the inhabitants  seated themselves there,  the father divid<a id="l224"></a>ding his new territories among all his sons according to the law of those <a id="l225"></a>times &amp; the lot of Nimrod falling in Chaldea. ffor there was the <a id="l226"></a>beginning of his kingdom  before he went into Assyria And as Chus thus divided his  territories <a id="l228"></a>amongst all his sons so it is to be presumed that his sons &amp; grandsons  <a id="l229"></a>(Nimrod as well as ye rest) divided theirs among their children according to the same law,  till kingdoms became as small in those re<a id="l231"></a>gions as in other parts of the world.  ffor I shew els where <a id="l239"></a>that the famous Assyrian monarchy  grew up  by conquest out of many small kingdoms long after these first ages.</p>
<p id="par11" class="i0">Its true that Nimrod built &amp; reigned over divers cities but  it <a id="l241"></a>may be presummed that  he   built them for his children &amp; left <a id="l242"></a> to every one his inheritance. ffor Bochartus – – –</p>

<p id="par17">The first great kingdom in the world on this side the <a id="l344"></a>Indies seems to have been that of Eygpt. ffor <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup>  Pliny in <a id="l345"></a>recconing up the first inventors of things ascribes to the <a id="l346"></a>Egyptians the invention of a royal City, &amp; to the inha<a id="l347"></a>bitants of Attica that of a popular one. Which is as <a id="l348"></a>much as to say that Athens was by the Greeks accounted <a id="l349"></a>the first city in the world under which other cities – <a id="l350"></a>united into a popular dominion by a common Council, &amp; <a id="l351"></a>the Eygptian Thebes the first city which became the seat <a id="l352"></a>of a kingdom. For Thebes was famous in Homers days <a id="l353"></a>when the four Monarachies &amp; their head cities were not <a id="l354"></a>yet talked of. <em class="underline">For</em>, saith <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup>  Strabo <em class="underline">Homer knew nothing <a id="l355"></a>of the Empire of the Medes &amp; Assyrians, otherwise <a id="l356"></a><sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup>  naming the Eygptian Thebes &amp; her riches &amp; those of</em> <a id="l357"></a>the Phoenicians, he would not have passed over in si<a id="l358"></a>lence the riches of Babylon Nineveh &amp; Ecbatane.</p>
<p id="par18">Egypt is a long &amp; narrow tract running north &amp; <a id="l359"></a>south on both sides the river Nile between two moun<a id="l360"></a>tains. The south end of this region with the spacious country beyond it was called Ethiopia <a id="l361"></a>&amp; the people Ethiopians. The middlemost tract was <a id="l362"></a>Thebais called in scripture the land of Pathros &amp; the <a id="l363"></a>lowest northern part was Mizraim. In Thebais between <a id="l364"></a>the Nile &amp; the red Sea, not far from Thebes was  the <a id="l365"></a>city Coptus,<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup>  whence its probable that the Coptites were originally a people <a id="l366"></a>of  Thebais. but in time they gave their name to all the E<a id="l367"></a>gyptians:  and thence the Greeks formed  ἀια Copti,  Ægyptus.  probably  the Coptites founded Thebes &amp; thereby spread their name with their dominion  Sir Iohn Marsham reccons that Thebais <a id="l370"></a>was anciently divided into two kingdomes the one on the <a id="l371"></a>east side of the Nile under the head city Thebes, the other <a id="l372"></a>on the west side under the head city This, &amp; that Misraim <a id="l373"></a>or  Egypt below Thebais was also anciently divided into two king<a id="l374"></a>doms, the lower upon the seven streams of Nile &amp; the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p097r"> &lt;97r&gt; </span> upper between that &amp; Thebais; both which were called Misra<a id="l375"></a>im in the dual  number to signify that they were two. And out of these four kingdomes <a id="l376"></a>&amp; perhaps some others at length arose the Monarchy of <a id="l377"></a>Egypt. But how those kingdoms at first arose out of smaller ones <a id="l378"></a>is hard to relate by reason of the great antiquity of the <a id="l379"></a>kingdoms. Yet some footsteps there are of their first <a id="l380"></a>original.</p>

<p id="par19"> On the western bounds of Egypt about 180 miles above Pelusium <a id="l381"></a>was  the city On or Heliopolis. The way between them was through <a id="l382"></a>a desert  over which there was an open access   into Egypt till <a id="l383"></a>Sesostris fenced Eygpt on that side with a great ditch  of water <a id="l384"></a>carried from  Pelusuim to Helipolis.  The Kingdom of Pharoah <a id="l385"></a>in the days of Ioseph &amp; Moses comprehended   the territories of <a id="l386"></a>Pithom &amp; On &amp; the  regions  between them &amp; the  Nile &amp; the <a id="l387"></a>land of Zoan on the other side the  Pelusiotic mouth of the river <a id="l388"></a> How much further it extended is uncertain Ioseph's <a id="l389"></a>going throughout all the land of Egypt, (Gen 41.45, 46) &amp;  Israel's being scattered in <a id="l390"></a>two days time throughout all the land of Eygpt  to gather stubble in stead of straw <a id="l391"></a>(Exod. 5.12, 14) shews that this kingdom in those ages was but of small <a id="l392"></a>extent.  It is called Mizraim,  that is the two  lands or two cities of Misor <a id="l393"></a> but what those lands or cities were is  not in history. <a id="l395"></a>The word Mizraim   was afterwards used to signify all <a id="l396"></a>Egypt below Thebais, &amp; the Turks still call it Missir.</p>

<p id="par23">The first king Tethmosis or Amosis who expelled the shepherds is <a id="l415"></a>plainly the same with Thmosis or Thuthmosis whose  Predecessor <a id="l416"></a>Misphragmuthosis  shut them up in Abaris &amp; therefore the first <a id="l417"></a>&amp; second Amenophis  who succeeded them is one &amp; the same <a id="l418"></a>Amenophis, &amp; I take the third Amenophis to be still the same &amp; his <a id="l419"></a>predecessor Armesses Rammeses or Ammeses to be the same with  their <a id="l420"></a> Predecessors. Amosis Thomosis or Tethmosis. the predecessors of the first &amp; second Amenophis <a id="l421"></a>Africanus recites  further out of the 11<sup>th</sup> &amp; 12<sup>th</sup> Dynasties of Manetho <a id="l422"></a>these four kings as reigning in order, Ammenemes, Gesongoses the son <a id="l423"></a>of Ammenemes, Ammanemes &amp; Sesostris  &amp; of these the first &amp; second <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p098v"> &lt;98v&gt; </span> seem to be the same kings with the third &amp; fourth, Gesongoses (whom Eusebius calls Sesonchosis) being cor<a id="l424"></a>ruptly written for Sesonchosis  or Sesak. By all which its plain <a id="l425"></a>to me that  it was frequent with Manetho to repeat the <a id="l426"></a>same kings several times. And by comparing all these successions of <a id="l427"></a>kings together they seem to me to be but several repetitions of <a id="l428"></a>the same race of Kings succeeding in this order. 1 Mephramu<a id="l429"></a>thosis, Mispharmuthosis or Misphragmuthosis.  2 Tethmosis, Thmosis, Thomosis, Amosis, Ammeses, <a id="l431"></a>Armesses, Rammeses, Rameses, Remesses. 3 Chebron or Chebros if <a id="l432"></a>he be rightly inserted. 4 Amenophis, Amenophthis, Menophis, <a id="l433"></a>Ammenoph Ammenemes, Ammon. 5 Sethos, Sethosis, Gesongoses, Sesonchosis, <a id="l434"></a>Sesostris.</p>

<p id="par25">Considering that Amosis besieged the Shepherds after his father Mis<a id="l437"></a>phragmuthosis had shut them up in Abaris: its probable that this <a id="l438"></a>siege was in the beginning of the reign of Amosis so that Amosis <a id="l439"></a>might reign many years after the expulsion of the Shepherds &amp; <a id="l440"></a>so be contenporary to Saul &amp; some part of the reign of David <a id="l441"></a>ffor I reccon that he expelled the Shepherds after the 20<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l442"></a>of Samuel when Samuel by one single victory over the Philis<a id="l443"></a>tines restored  liberty &amp; a long peace to Israel 1 Sam. 7.13, 14 &amp; <a id="l444"></a>before the 2<sup>d</sup> year of Saul when the Israelites were again in <a id="l445"></a>bondage &amp; the Philistines with a very numerous army made a new <a id="l446"></a>vehement &amp; lasting war upon Saul &amp; David &amp; could not be <a id="l447"></a>subduded  till they had been beaten in many battels 1. Sam <a id="l448"></a>13.. According to Manetho he reigns after the expulsion of the <a id="l449"></a>Shepherds 25 years 4 months &amp; Chebron 13 years &amp;  by this <a id="l450"></a>recconing the reign of Amenophis will begin about the 24<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l451"></a>David &amp; that of his son Sethosis will be coincident with the reign <a id="l452"></a>of Sesak.</p>
<p id="par26">We are told in Scripture that Sesak came out of Egypt with <a id="l453"></a>1200 chariots – – — — — answers to that of Sesak in scripture. Well <a id="l454"></a>therefore doth Iosephus affirm<sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup>  that Herodotus ascribes  to Sesostris the  actions of Sesak  &amp; particularly his invasion &amp; conquest of Iudea erring only in the name of the King.</p>
<p id="par27">Herodotus in giving an Account of the ancient state of Egypt <a id="l456"></a>— — — — — Apries, Amasis, Psammenitus. </p>
<p id="par28">Diodorus tells us<sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> that the father of Sesostris gathered together <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p099r"> &lt;99r&gt; </span> out of all Eygpt the male children who were born the same <a id="l458"></a>day with Sesostris &amp; placed them with nurses &amp; governours &amp; <a id="l459"></a>prescribed to them all the same form of education &amp; discipline <a id="l460"></a>being perswaded that they who were so brought up with his <a id="l461"></a>son would be most faithfull &amp; usefull to him in his warrs. <a id="l462"></a>These children he brought up with exercises of dayly labours <a id="l463"></a>commanding that none of them should eat till he had run <a id="l464"></a>180 stadia. By which means they became endued with <a id="l465"></a>strong &amp; active bodies &amp; great aspiring minds. Hence I <a id="l466"></a>gather that the father of Sesostris was king of Egypt <a id="l467"></a>before Sesostris or Sesak was born,  <a id="l468"></a>&amp; by consequence he was that Pharaoh king of Egypt who <a id="l469"></a>married his daughter to Solomon &amp; took Gezer from the <a id="l470"></a>Canaanites &amp; gave it to his daughter for a present. ffor Sesak <a id="l471"></a>as we shall shew hereafter was of about the same age with <a id="l472"></a>Solomon's young spouse &amp; her little sister who  by reason of her childhood had no breasts.</p>
<p id="par29">Sesostris being thus brought up was sent by his father <a id="l474"></a>with an army into that Arabia which lies between Egypt &amp; the <a id="l475"></a>Red Sea &amp; being accompanied with those his companions who <a id="l476"></a>were brought up with him they overcame the want of water <a id="l477"></a>&amp; food &amp; conquered all that nation which till then had been <a id="l478"></a>unconquered. Then being sent towards the west he overcame <a id="l479"></a>a great part of Afric though but yet a youth. By the first <a id="l480"></a>of these conquests the Troglodytes &amp; by the latter the Libyans <a id="l481"></a>of Marmorica &amp; Cyrene came under the dominion of Egypt. <a id="l482"></a>And this seems to have given occasion to the trafic of Solomon <a id="l483"></a>into Egypt for horses. ffor Egypt was supplied with horses from <a id="l484"></a>Cyrene, a country famous for breeding a multitude of good horses.</p>

To the Calendar of this year Cleobulus one of the seven wise men alluded in his Parable of one father who had 12 sons, each of which had 30 daughters half white &amp; half black. Thales called the last <a id="l496"></a>day of the Lunar month the 30<sup>th</sup>, &amp; Solon called it ἕνην <a id="l497"></a>καὶ νέαν the old &amp; the new.

And these periods seem to have been as <a id="l506"></a>old as the religions of Greece being used in divers of their sacra <a id="l507"></a>The Octaeteris was the Annus magnus of Cadmus &amp; Minos, &amp; seems to <a id="l508"></a>have been brought into Greece  &amp; Crete by the Phenicians who <a id="l509"></a>came with Cadmus &amp; Europa, &amp; to have continued till after the <a id="l510"></a>days of Herodotus.

And according to the number <a id="l513"></a>of days in the Calendar year of the Greeks Demetrius Phalareus had <a id="l514"></a>360 statues erected to him by the Athenians. But the Greeks (Cleostratus, Harpalus &amp; others, to make their months agree better with the course of the Moon in the <a id="l515"></a>days of the Persian Empire varied the manner of intercaling the three <a id="l516"></a>months in the Octaeteris inserting a month in the third 5<sup>t</sup> &amp; 8<sup>th</sup> year &amp; Meton found out the cycle of intercaling seven<sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> months in 19 years. ‖The ancient year of the Egyptians was also <a id="l517"></a>Lunisolar, &amp; continued to be so till the days of Hyperion or Osyris <a id="l518"></a>a king of Egypt the father of Helius &amp; Selene or Orus &amp; Bubaste. <a id="l519"></a>for the Israelites brought  this year out of Egypt, &amp; Diodorus <a id="l520"></a>tells us that Vranus the father of Hyperion used this year, &amp; that <a id="l521"></a>in the Temple of Osiris the Priests appointed thereunto filled 360 milk <a id="l522"></a>bowls every day; I think he means one bowle every day, in all 360, <a id="l523"></a>to count the number of days in the Calendar year, &amp; thereby to find <a id="l524"></a>the difference between this &amp; the true solar year. For this was the <a id="l525"></a>year to the end of which they added five days. That the Israelites used <a id="l526"></a> the Lunisolar year is beyond question.

<p id="par33"><sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> The first month of the Lunisolar year began sometimes <a id="l644"></a>a week or fortnight before the Equinox &amp; sometimes as much <a id="l645"></a>after it.

Achilles Tatius tells us that some anciently <a id="l649"></a>placed the Solstice in the beginning of Cancer, others <a id="l650"></a>in the eighth degree of Cancer others about the twelft <a id="l651"></a>degree &amp; others about the 15<sup>th</sup> degree. This variety of <a id="l652"></a>opinions proceeded from the præcession of the Equinox <a id="l653"></a>then not known to the Greeks. When the sphere was <a id="l654"></a>first formed the Equinox was in the 15<sup>th</sup> degree or <a id="l655"></a>middle of the constellation of Cancer. Then it came <a id="l656"></a>into the 12<sup>th</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> &amp;1<sup>st</sup> degree successively. Eudoxus <a id="l657"></a>in describing the sphere of the ancients placed the <a id="l658"></a>Solstices &amp; Equinoxes in the middle of the Constellations <a id="l659"></a>of  Aries Chelæ Cancer &amp; Capricorn as is <a id="l660"></a>affirmed by Hipparchus Bithynus, &amp; appears also by the <a id="l661"></a>description of the Equinoctial &amp; Tropical circles in Aratus <a id="l662"></a>who copied after Eudoxus, &amp; by the positions of the <a id="l663"></a>Colures of the Equinoxes &amp; Solstices which in the sphere <a id="l664"></a>of Eudoxus described by Hipparchus went through the middle <a id="l665"></a>of those Constellations.

It seems therefore to have <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p102r"> &lt;102r&gt; </span> been formed by Chiron &amp; Musæus for the use of the Argo<a id="l676"></a>nauts.

And the Trojan war <a id="l701"></a>was one generation later, several captains of the Greeks<sup class="note" id="n43-ref">[43]</sup>  <a id="l702"></a>in that war being sons of the Argonauts.

<p id="par34">These recconings founded upon Astronomy  differing from the Chronology of the Greeks give us <a id="l717"></a>occasion to enquire into the reason of the difference.</p>

Apollodorus followed Eratostosthenes &amp; both of them followed Thucydides in recconing 80 years from the Trojan war to the return of the Hera<a id="l816"></a>clides into Peloponesus  but in recconing 328 years from that return to the first <a id="l818"></a>Olympiad,  they computed the times by the succession of the kings of Lacedemon, as Plutarch also ✝<sup class="note" id="n60-ref">[60]</sup>  affirms. And therein they have been ever since followed by Chronologers. And since this recconing was gathered by <a id="l821"></a>computing the times from the kings of the Lacedemonians, <a id="l822"></a>that is from their number, Let us  reexamin that <a id="l823"></a>computation.</p>
<p id="par38">All nations before they began to keep exact accounts <a id="l824"></a>of time have been prone to raise their antiquities, &amp; this <a id="l825"></a>humour has been promoted by the contention between nations <a id="l826"></a>about the antiquity of their originals. The Greeks &amp; Latines have <a id="l827"></a>been more modest in this point then the Egyptians &amp; some<sup class="note" id="n61-ref">[61]</sup>  <a id="l828"></a>other nations but yet have exceeded the truth. For in stating <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p105r"> &lt;105r&gt; </span> the times by the reigns of such kings as were ancienter <a id="l829"></a>then the Persian Monarchy they have put their reigns <a id="l830"></a>equipollent to generations, &amp; accordingly made them one <a id="l831"></a>with another an age a piece, recconing three ages to an hun<a id="l832"></a>dred years. For they make the seven kings of Rome who <a id="l833"></a>preceded the Consuls to have reigned 244 years, which is one <a id="l834"></a>with another 35 years a piece. And the 14 Kings of the Latines <a id="l835"></a>between Æneas &amp; Numitor or the destruction of Troy &amp; <a id="l836"></a>founding of Rome to have reigned 425 years which is above <a id="l837"></a>30 years a piece. And the first ten kings of Macedon (Caranus &amp;c) <a id="l838"></a>to have reigned 353 years  which is above 35 years a piece <a id="l839"></a>&amp; the first ten kings of Athens (Cecrops &amp;c) 351 years which is 35 <a id="l840"></a>years a piece. And the eight first kings of Argos (Inachus, Phoroneus &amp;c) <a id="l841"></a>to have reigned 371 years which is above 46 years a piece. And <a id="l842"></a>between the return of the Heraclides &amp; the end of the first <a id="l843"></a>Messenian war the ten kings of Sparta by one race (Exrysthenes <a id="l844"></a>Agis,  Echestratus, Labotas, Doriagus, Agesilaus, Archelaus, Telechus <a id="l845"></a>Alcamines &amp; Polydorus) the nine by the other race (Procles, Sous <a id="l846"></a>Euripon, Prytanis, Eunomus, Polydectes, Charilaus, Nicander Theopompus,) <a id="l847"></a>the ten kings of Messene (Cresphontes Epytus,  Glaucus, Istmius, <a id="l848"></a>Doladas, Sybolas, Phintas, Antiochus, Euphaes, Aristodemus,) &amp; the nine <a id="l849"></a>of Arcadia (Cypselus, Olæas, Bucolion, Phialus, Simus, Pompus, <a id="l850"></a>Ægineta, Polymnestor, Æchmis) took up 379 years which is 38 years <a id="l851"></a>a piece to the ten kings &amp; 42 years a piece to the nine. And the <a id="l852"></a>five kings of Sparta of the race of Eurysthenes  <a id="l853"></a>between the end of the first Messenian war &amp; the beginning <a id="l854"></a>of the reign of Darius Hystaspis (Eurycrates, Anaxander, Eurycrates II, <a id="l855"></a>Leon, Anaxandrides)  reigned 202 years which is above 40 <a id="l856"></a>years a piece. Thus the Greek Chronologers who followed Ephorus <a id="l857"></a>have made the kings of their several cities who lived before the <a id="l858"></a>times of the Persian Empire to reign about 35 or 40 years a <a id="l859"></a>piece one with another, which is a length so much beyond the <a id="l860"></a>course of nature as is not to be credited. For by the ordinary course <a id="l861"></a>of nature kings reign one with another about 18 or 20 years a piece <a id="l862"></a>And if in some instances they reign 5 or 6 years longer in others <a id="l863"></a>they reign as much shorter. Eighteen or 20 years is a medium. <a id="l864"></a>So the 18 kings of Iudah who succeeded Solomon reigned 390 years <a id="l865"></a>which is one with another 22 years a piece.

But if the generations proceed <a id="l883"></a>by the eldest sons they are shorter so that three of them may be <a id="l884"></a>recconed to  75 or 80 years. And the reigns of Kings <a id="l885"></a>is still shorter because Kings are succeeded not only by their <a id="l886"></a>eldest sons but sometimes by their brothers &amp; sometimes they are <a id="l887"></a>slain or deposed &amp; succeeded by others of an equal or greater <a id="l888"></a>age, especially in elective &amp; turbulent kingdoms. But Ephorus <a id="l889"></a>&amp; his followers have taken the reigns of kings for generations <a id="l890"></a>&amp; recconned thre generations to an hundred &amp; sometimes to an hundred <a id="l891"></a>&amp; twenty years &amp; founded the technical chronology of the Greeks <a id="l892"></a>upon this way of recconing. Let the recconing be reduced to the <a id="l893"></a>course of nature by putting the reigns of kings one with <a id="l894"></a>another at about 18 or 20 years a reign: &amp;   <a id="l895"></a>the ten kings of Sparta by one race, the nine by another race <a id="l896"></a>the ten kings of Messens &amp; the nine of Arcadia above mentioned <a id="l897"></a>between the return of the Heraclides into Peloponesus &amp; the end <a id="l898"></a>of the first Messenian war will scarce take up above 180 or<sup class="note" id="n62-ref">[62]</sup>  <a id="l899"></a>200 years.  Euryleon the son of Ægeus commanded <a id="l901"></a>the main body of the Messenians in the fift year of the <a id="l902"></a>first Messenian war &amp; was in the fift generation from <a id="l903"></a>Oiolyeus the son of Theras the brother in law of Aristodemus <a id="l904"></a>&amp; Tutor of his sons Eurysthenes &amp; Proclus as Pausanias <a id="l905"></a>relates; &amp; by consequence from the return of the Heraclides <a id="l906"></a>which was in the days of Theras to the battel in the fift <a id="l907"></a>year of this war there were six generations, which ( as I <a id="l908"></a>conceive) being for the most part by the eldest sons, <a id="l909"></a> will scarce exceed 30 years to a gene<a id="l910"></a>ration &amp; so  may amount to about to about  175 or 180 years. That <a id="l911"></a>war lasted 20 years. Add the last 15 years &amp; there will be <a id="l912"></a>about 190 or 195 years to the end of that war. Thus by <a id="l913"></a>five several ways of recconing this period scarce amounted <a id="l914"></a>to 200 years, whereas the followers of Ephorus make it <a id="l915"></a>about 380 years.  In the race of the Spartan kings descended <a id="l916"></a>from Eurysthenes, after Polydorus reigned these kings, Eurycrates <a id="l917"></a>I, Anaxander, Eurycrates II, Leon, Anaxandrides, Cleomenes, <a id="l918"></a>Leonidas, &amp;c., and in the other race after Theopompus reigned <a id="l919"></a>Zeukidamus, Anaxidamus, Archidamus, Agasicles, Ariston, <a id="l920"></a>Demaratus, Leotycides, &amp;c according to Pausanias,  or Anaxandridas <a id="l921"></a>Archidemus, Ananileus, Leutychides, Hippocratides, Ariston, <a id="l922"></a>Demaratus, Leutychides II according to Herodotus. Leonidas was <a id="l923"></a>slain at Thermopylæ in the sixt year of Xerxes &amp; Leuty<a id="l924"></a>chides was then alive, so that in one race there were seven <a id="l925"></a>kings between the end of the first Messenian war &amp; the sixt <a id="l926"></a>year of Xerxes &amp; in the other race there were between <a id="l927"></a>six &amp; seven kings according to Pausanius  or between seven <a id="l928"></a>&amp; eight according to Herodotus, or at a medium, seven kings <a id="l929"></a>in both races. Which at 20 years to a reign take up 140 years. <a id="l930"></a>And these years being added to the 190 or 200 years between <a id="l931"></a>the return of the Heraclides into Peloponesus &amp; the end of the <a id="l932"></a>first Messenian war &amp; to the 139 years between the  sixt years of Xerxes the 20<sup>th</sup> year of Philip an 4 Olymp. 109, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p107r"> &lt;107r&gt; </span> make almost 480 years from the return of the Heraclides into <a id="l934"></a>Peloponesus to the 20 year of Philip: Whereas Ephorus reccons this <a id="l935"></a>interval to be almost 750 years, &amp; later Chronologers make <a id="l936"></a>it 760 years, which is 280 years too long.

<p id="par40" class="i0">– of the ancient Chronology of the Greeks</p>

<p id="par41">⊡ The kingdom of Macedon was founded by Caranus &amp; Perdiccas <a id="l943"></a>who being of the race of Temenus king of Argos fled from Argos <a id="l944"></a>in the reign of Phidon the brother of Caranus. Temenus entred<sup class="note" id="n63-ref">[63]</sup>  Pelo<a id="l945"></a>ponnesus with the  Heraclides as above &amp; after him &amp; his son Cisus <a id="l946"></a>the kingdom of Argos became divided among the posterity of Temenus <a id="l947"></a>untill Phidon reunited it expelling his kindred. He grew potent, ap<a id="l948"></a>pointed weights &amp; measures in Peloponnesus &amp; removing the Pisæans &amp; <a id="l949"></a>Eleans presided in the Olympic games, but was soon after subdued <a id="l950"></a>by the Eleans &amp; Spartans. Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n64-ref">[64]</sup>  reccons Per<a id="l951"></a>diccas the first king of Macedon. Later writers as Livy Pausanias <a id="l952"></a>&amp; Suidas make Caranus the first king. Iustin calls Perdiccas <a id="l953"></a>the successor of Caranus &amp; Solinus saith that Perdiccas succeeded <a id="l954"></a>Caranus &amp; was the first that obteined the name of king. Its <a id="l955"></a>probable that Caranus &amp; Perdiccas were contemporaries, &amp; fled at <a id="l956"></a>the same time from  Phidon &amp; at first erected small <a id="l957"></a>Principalities which after the death of Caranus became one under <a id="l958"></a>Perdiccas. Herodotus tells us<sup class="note" id="n65-ref">[65]</sup>  that after Perdiccas reigned Aræus <a id="l959"></a>(or Argæus,) Philip, Aeropus, Alcetas, Amyntas, &amp; Alexander suc<a id="l960"></a>cessively. Alexander was contemporary to Xerxes king of Persia, <a id="l961"></a>&amp; died an . 4 Olymp. 79 &amp; was succeeded by Perdiccas, &amp; Pausanias tells us<sup class="note" id="n66-ref">[66]</sup>  that there were <a id="l962"></a>eight kings of Macedon before Archelaus the son of Perdiccas. Now <a id="l963"></a>by recconing above 40 years a piece to these kings, Chronologers <a id="l964"></a>have made Caranus older then the Olympiads. Whereas if <a id="l965"></a>we should reccon their reigns at about 18 or 20 years a piece <a id="l966"></a>the first seven reigns counted backwards from the death of <a id="l967"></a> Alexander will place the beginning of the kingdom of Macedon <a id="l968"></a>under Perdiccas &amp; Caranus upon the 46<sup>th</sup> Olympiad or there<a id="l969"></a>abouts. It could not be older because Leocides the son of <a id="l970"></a>Phidon &amp; Megacles the Son of Alcmæon an Athenian at one &amp; the same time courted <a id="l971"></a>Agarista the daughter of Clisthenes king of Sicyon (as Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n67-ref">[67]</sup>  <a id="l972"></a>tells us,) &amp; the Amphictyons by the advice of Solon made Alc<a id="l973"></a>mæon &amp; Clysthenes &amp; Eurolycus king of Thessaly commanders <a id="l974"></a>of their army in their war against Cyrrha &amp; the Cyrrhæans <a id="l975"></a>were conquered an. 2, Olymp. 47, according to the Marbles. <a id="l976"></a>Phidon therefore &amp; his brother Caranus were contemporary to <a id="l977"></a>Alcmæon &amp; all of them to Clisthenes &amp; Solon, &amp; flourished about <a id="l978"></a>the 47<sup>th</sup> or 48<sup>th</sup> Olympiad.

The Eleans might call in Phidon against the <a id="l1006"></a>Pisæans &amp; upon overcoming them claim the presiding in <a id="l1007"></a>the games &amp; be refused by Phidon, &amp; then confederate with <a id="l1008"></a>the Spartans &amp; by their assistance overthrow the kingdom <a id="l1009"></a>of Phidon, &amp; recover  their ancient right <a id="l1010"></a>of presiding in the games.</p>

<p id="par43">Strabo tells us that Phidon was the tenth from Temenus <a id="l1011"></a>not the tenth king, for between Cisus &amp; Phidon they reigned not, but <a id="l1012"></a>the tenth by generation from father to son including Temenus. <a id="l1013"></a>If 27 years be recconed to a generation by the eldest sons, <a id="l1014"></a>the nine intervalls will amount to 243 years, which being <a id="l1015"></a>subducted from the 48<sup>th</sup> Olympiad in which Phidon flourished, <a id="l1016"></a>they will place the return of the Heraclides about fifty years <a id="l1017"></a>before the beginning of the Olympiads as above.

<p id="par52">Polydorus the son of Cadmus married Nicteis the daughter<sup class="note" id="n86-ref">[86]</sup>  <a id="l1220"></a>of Nicteus, &amp; dying left his kingdom &amp; young son Labdacus under <a id="l1221"></a>the administration of Nicteus.

Nicteus left the tuition <a id="l1225"></a>of Labdacus &amp; administration of the kingdom to his brother <a id="l1226"></a>Lycus, &amp; Epopeus ( or, as Hyginus calls him, Epaphus) left his <a id="l1227"></a>kingdom to Lamedon who presently ended the war by sending <a id="l1228"></a>home Antiopa, &amp; she in returning home brought forth Amphion <a id="l1229"></a>&amp; Zethus. Labdacus being grown up received the kingdom  from Lycus, <a id="l1230"></a>&amp; afterwards dying left it again to his administration. When <a id="l1231"></a>Amphion &amp; Zethus were about twenty years old, at the insti<a id="l1232"></a>gation of their mother Antiopa they killed Lycus, &amp; made <a id="l1233"></a>Laius the young son of Labdacus fly to Pelops, &amp; seized the city <a id="l1234"></a>Thebes &amp; compassed it with a wall.

The fortifying of this place against Osarsephus gave occasion to the building of it. He reigned in the times of the Trojan War &amp; I <a id="l1920"></a>think  about ten or twenty years longer, &amp; the Temple of Vulcan might <a id="l1921"></a>be then founded by him upon the death of  Cinyras the husband of Venus <a id="l1922"></a>&amp; Vulcan of Egypt who had furnished their kings with armour.

In a plane not far from Memphis are many small Pyramids <a id="l1928"></a>said to be built by Venephes, &amp; I  suspect that Venephes has been written corruptly <a id="l1929"></a>for  Menophis or Amenophis. ffor after the example of these <a id="l1930"></a>Pyramids the following Kings built others much larger The plane in which they were built was the burying place of that city as appears by the Mummies there found &amp; therefore the Pyramids were the sepulchral monuments of the kings &amp; Princes of that city.</p>
<p id="par85">For  next after Amenophis &amp; his son Ramses, called Rhampsinitus by <a id="l1931"></a>Herodotus reigned Moeris who built the lake of Mœris with two <a id="l1932"></a>great pyramids of brick in the middle of it.  ffor preserving the division of Egypt into equal shares amongst the soldiers this king wrote a book of surveying which gave a beginning to Geometry. And after the example of the two brick Pyramids which he built Cecrops Cephren &amp; Mycerinus who reigned successively <a id="l1934"></a>after him, built the three great Pyramids of marble. Mycerinus <a id="l1935"></a>died before the third was finished &amp; his  successor Nitocris <a id="l1936"></a>finished it. Then reigned Asychis who build the eastern Portico of <a id="l1937"></a>the temple of Vulcan very slendidly, &amp; a large Pyramid of brick, <a id="l1938"></a>&amp; was succeeded by Anysis a blind man. And these are the kings <a id="l1939"></a>who reigned at Memphys, &amp; spent their time in adorning that <a id="l1940"></a>city untill Ægypt was again  divided into <a id="l1941"></a>several small kingdoms. For Nitocris &amp; Asychis were succeeded at  Thebes by Gnephactus &amp; his son Boccharis; at Sais by Stephanates <a id="l1943"></a>Necepsos &amp; Nechus; &amp; at Tanis by Petubastes, Osorchon, Psammis &amp; <a id="l1944"></a> Zet .

He saith also that in <a id="l2015"></a>those days the Gods [having finished their conquests] divided <a id="l2016"></a>the whole earth amongst themselves partly into larger &amp; <a id="l2017"></a>partly into smaller portions, &amp; instituted Temples &amp; sacred <a id="l2018"></a>rites to themselves, &amp; that the island Atlantis fell to the lot <a id="l2019"></a>of Neptune, who made his eldest son Atlas king of the whole <a id="l2020"></a>Island, a part of which was called Gadir, &amp; that in the history <a id="l2021"></a>of the said wars mention was made of Cecrops, Erechtheus, <a id="l2022"></a>Erecthonius, Erisichthon &amp; others before Theseus, &amp; also of the <a id="l2023"></a>weomen who warred with the men &amp; of the habit &amp; statue <a id="l2024"></a>of Minerva, the study of war in those days being common <a id="l2025"></a>to men &amp; weomen. By all these circumstances it is manifest <a id="l2026"></a>that these Gods were the Dij magni majorum Gentium,  &amp; lived in the ages between Cecrops &amp; Theseus <a id="l2027"></a>&amp; that the wars which Sesostris made upon the nations by <a id="l2028"></a>sea &amp; land &amp; the following invasion of Egypt by Neptune <a id="l2029"></a>are here described; &amp; how the Captains of Sesostris shared <a id="l2030"></a>his conquests among themselves, as the captains of Alex<a id="l2031"></a>ander the great did his conquests long after; &amp; instituting <a id="l2032"></a>Temples &amp; Priests &amp; sacred rites to themselves caused the <a id="l2033"></a> nations to worship them after death as Gods; &amp; that the <a id="l2034"></a>island Gadir or Gades with the dominions thereof over Libya as far as Ægypt fell to the lot of him who after <a id="l2035"></a>death was deified by the name of Neptune. For in that <a id="l2036"></a>island Homer places Calypso the daughter of Atlas presently after <a id="l2037"></a>the Trojan war when Vlysses being shipwrackt, escaped thither. Homer <a id="l2038"></a>calls it the Ogygian island &amp; places it 18 or 20 days sail westward <a id="l2039"></a>from Pheacia or Corcyra. And so many days sail  <a id="l2040"></a>Gades is from Corcyra, recconing with the ancients a thousand sta<a id="l2041"></a>dia to a days sail. This island is by Homer described a small <a id="l2042"></a>one destitute of shipping &amp; cities &amp; inhabited only by Calypso <a id="l2043"></a>&amp; her weomen who dwelt in a cave in the midst of a wood, <a id="l2044"></a>there being no men in the island to assist Vlysses in building <a id="l2045"></a>a new ship or to accompany him thence to Corcyra: which de<a id="l2046"></a>scription of the island agrees to Gades. And the time when the <a id="l2047"></a>Gods made war &amp; shared the earth &amp; caused themselves to be <a id="l2048"></a>worshipped as Gods, is by Solon limited to the age of Neptune <a id="l2049"></a>the father of Atlas &amp; grandfather of Calypso, &amp; so was but <a id="l2050"></a>two generations before the destruction of Troy. This is that Nep<a id="l2051"></a>tune who with Apollo or Orus fortified Troy with a wall in <a id="l2052"></a>the reign of Laomedon, &amp; left many children in Greece some <a id="l2053"></a>of which were Argonauts &amp; others were contemporary to the Argo<a id="l2054"></a>nauts; &amp; therefore he flourished one generation before the Ar<a id="l2055"></a>gonautic expedition, or about 400 years before Solon went <a id="l2056"></a>into Egypt. But the Priests of Egypt in those 400 years, had mag<a id="l2057"></a>nified the stories &amp; antiquity of their Gods so exceedingly as <a id="l2058"></a>to make them  nine thousand years older then Solon, &amp; the <a id="l2059"></a>island Atlantis bigger then all Afric &amp; Asia together, &amp; full of <a id="l2060"></a>people. And because in the days of Solon this great island did <a id="l2061"></a>not appear, they pretended that it was sunk into the sea <a id="l2062"></a>with all its people. Thus great was the vanity of the Priests <a id="l2063"></a>of Egypt in magnifying their antiquities.</p>

But Hercules at length intercepted his <a id="l2105"></a>recruits &amp; slew him &amp; took the Libyan world from his <a id="l2106"></a>successor Atlas &amp; made Atlas pay tribute out of his <a id="l2107"></a>golden orchard, the  kingdom of Libya. Whence its probable that <a id="l2108"></a>Antæus was the proper name of Neptune the father of <a id="l2109"></a>Atlas &amp; Neptune the name by which Antæus was deified <a id="l2110"></a>ffor it was usual in those days to deify men by new names. <a id="l2111"></a>So Sesak was deified  in several countries by <a id="l2112"></a>the several names of Osiris, Bacchus, Dionysus, Belus, Mars &amp; <a id="l2113"></a>Hercules; Thoas Calycopis &amp; Gingris by the names of Vulcan <a id="l2114"></a>Venus &amp; Adonis; Alcæus the son of Alcmena by the name <a id="l2115"></a>of Hercules; Ino &amp; her son Melicertes by the names of Len<a id="l2116"></a>cothea &amp; Palæmon; the son of Semele by the name of Bacchus, <a id="l2117"></a>&amp; Romulus by the name of Quirinus.

<p id="par93">As the Gods or ancient Kings &amp; Princes of Greece, Egypt<sup class="note" id="n150-ref">[150]</sup>  <a id="l2152"></a>&amp; Syria of Damascus have been made much ancienter then <a id="l2153"></a>the truth, so have those of Chaldea &amp; Assyria.  For <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n151-ref">[151]</sup>  Diodorus tells us that when Alexander was in  Asia the Chaldeans recconed <a id="l2154"></a>470000 years since they first began to observe the motions of the stars. And Ctesias &amp; the <a id="l2155"></a>ancient Greek and Latin writers who copy from him, have <a id="l2156"></a>made the Assyrian Empire as old as that Belus or <a id="l2157"></a>Baal who was worshipped in all the east &amp; Belus as old as <a id="l2158"></a>Noah's flood within 60 or 70 years, &amp; tell us the names of <a id="l2159"></a>all the kings of Assyria down from his feigned son Ninus <a id="l2160"></a>to Sardanapalus the last king of that Monarchy. But the <a id="l2161"></a>names of his kings except one or two, have no affinity with the <a id="l2162"></a>names of the Assyrians mentioned in scripture. ffor the Assy<a id="l2163"></a>rians were usually named after their Gods Bel or Pul, <a id="l2164"></a>Chaddon, Haddon, Adon or Adonis, Melech or Moloch, Alsur or Assur, <a id="l2165"></a>Nebo, Nergal, Merodach, as in these names, Pul, Tiglath-<a id="l2166"></a>pul-asser, Salmon-asser, Adra-melech, Shar-asser, Asser-<a id="l2167"></a>haddon, Sardanapalus or Asser-adan-pul, Nabon-asser <a id="l2168"></a>or Nabo-adon-asser, Bel-adan, Chiniladan, or Chen-el-<a id="l2169"></a>adon, Nebo-pul-asser, Nebu-chadon-asser, Nebuzaradan <a id="l2170"></a>or Nebo-assar-adon, Nergal-asser, Nergal-shar-asser, <a id="l2171"></a>Labo-asser-dach, Shesheb-asser, Beltes-asser, Evil-meradach, <a id="l2172"></a>Shamgar-nebo, Rabsaris or Rab-asser, Nebu-shasban, <a id="l2173"></a>Mardocempad or Merodec-empad. Such were the Assyrian names <a id="l2174"></a>but those in  the Canon of Ctesias are of another sort, <a id="l2175"></a>except Sardanapalus whose name he had met with in <a id="l2176"></a>Herodotus. He makes Semiramis as old as the first Belus, <a id="l2177"></a>but Herodotus tells us that she was but five generations <a id="l2178"></a>older then the mother of Labynitus. He represents that the <a id="l2179"></a>city Ninus was founded by a man of the same name &amp; Babylon <a id="l2180"></a>by Semiramis, whereas either Nimrod or Assur founded those &amp; other <a id="l2181"></a>cities without giving his own name to any of them. He makes <a id="l2182"></a>the Assyrian empire continue about 1360 years whereas He<a id="l2183"></a>rodotus tells us that it lasted but 500 years, &amp; the numbers <a id="l2184"></a>of Herodotus concerning those old times are all of them <a id="l2185"></a>too long. He makes Nineveh destroyed by the Medes &amp; <a id="l2186"></a>Babylonians three hundred years before the reign of Astibares <a id="l2187"></a>&amp; Nebuchadnezzar who destroyed it, &amp; sets down the names <a id="l2188"></a>of seven or eight feigned kings of Media between the <a id="l2189"></a>destruction of Nineveh &amp; the reigns of Astibares &amp; Nebu<a id="l2190"></a>chadnezzar, as if the Empire of the Medes erected upon the <a id="l2191"></a>ruins of the Assyrian Empire had lasted 300 years, whereas <a id="l2192"></a>it lasted but 72. And the true Empire of the Assyrians <a id="l2193"></a>described in scripture, whose kings were Pul Tiglathpulasser <a id="l2194"></a>Salmonasser, Senacherib, Asserhaddon &amp;c he mentions not, tho <a id="l2195"></a>much nearer to his own times: which shews that he was <a id="l2196"></a>ignorant of the antiquities of the Assyrians. Yet something <a id="l2197"></a>of truth there is in the bottom of some of his stories as there <a id="l2198"></a>uses to be in Romances; as that Nineveh was destroyed by the <a id="l2199"></a>Medes &amp; Babylonians, that Sardanapalus was the last king of <a id="l2200"></a>Assyria, &amp; that Astibares &amp; Astyages were kings of the Medes: <a id="l2201"></a>but he has made all things too ancient, &amp; out of vain glory <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p128r"> &lt;128r&gt; </span> taken too great a liberty in feigning names &amp; stories <a id="l2202"></a>to please his reader.</p>
<p id="par94">When the Iews were newly returned from the <a id="l2203"></a>Babylonian captivity, they confessed their sins in this manner <a id="l2204"></a><em class="underline">Now therefore our God - - - - let not all the trouble seem little <a id="l2205"></a>before thee which hath come upon us, on our kings, on our Prin<a id="l2206"></a>ces &amp; on our Priests &amp; on our Prophets &amp; on our fathers &amp; on <a id="l2207"></a>all thy people since the time of the kings of Assyria unto <a id="l2208"></a>this day</em> (Nehem. 9.32) that is since the time of the king<a id="l2209"></a>dom of Assyria or since the rise of that Empire. And <a id="l2210"></a>therefore the Assyrian Empire arose when the kings of <a id="l2211"></a>Assyria began to afflict the inhabitants of Palestine; which <a id="l2212"></a>was in the days of Pul. He &amp; his successors afflicted Israel <a id="l2213"></a>&amp; conquered the nations round about, &amp; upon the ruin of <a id="l2214"></a>many small &amp; ancient kingdoms erected their Empire, <a id="l2215"></a>conquering the Medes as well as other nations. But of <a id="l2216"></a>these conquests Ctesias knew not a word, not not so much <a id="l2217"></a>as the names of the conquerors, or that there was an <a id="l2218"></a>Assyrian Empire now standing. ffor he supposes that the <a id="l2219"></a>Medes reigned at this time &amp; that the Assyrian Empire <a id="l2220"></a>was at an end above 250 years before it began.</p>

<p id="par95">However we must allow that Nimrod founded a kingdom <a id="l2221"></a>at Babylon &amp; perhaps extended it into Assyria; but this kingdom <a id="l2222"></a>was but of small extent if compared with the Empires which <a id="l2223"></a>rose up afterwards. And if it had been greater yet it was but <a id="l2224"></a>of short continuance, it being the custome in those early ages <a id="l2225"></a>for every father to divide his territories amongst his sons. So <a id="l2226"></a>Cham was king of all Afric &amp; Iaphet of all Asia minor &amp; Europe, <a id="l2227"></a>but they left not standing kingdoms. After the days of Nimrod we <a id="l2228"></a>hear no more of the Assyrians or of Nineveh or Babylon till the <a id="l2229"></a>days of Ionah. In the time of the Iudges of Israel &amp; reign of <a id="l2230"></a>David we find Syria &amp; Mesopotamia subject to kings of other <a id="l2231"></a>cities (Iud. 3.8. 2 Sam. 8 &amp; 10.) The kingdoms of Israel, Moab, Ammon, <a id="l2232"></a>Edom, Philistia, Sidon, Damascus, &amp; Hamath the great continued sub<a id="l2233"></a>ject to other Lords till the reign of Pul &amp; his successors, &amp; so did the <a id="l2234"></a>house of Eden (Amos 1.5. 2 King. 19.12) &amp; Haran or Carrhæ (Gen 12 <a id="l2235"></a>2 King. 19.12) &amp; Sepharraim in Mesopotamia &amp; Calneh neare Bagdad <a id="l2236"></a>(Gen 10.10 Isa 10.8. 2 King. 17.31.) Sesak &amp; Memnon were great con<a id="l2237"></a>querors in the East, but in their histories there's not a word of <a id="l2238"></a>an Assyrian Empire then standing to oppose them. On the contrary <a id="l2239"></a>the Assyrians sometime between the reigns of Nimrod &amp; Pul, went into <a id="l2240"></a>captivity (Amos 9.7.) Homer mentions Bacchus &amp; Memnon kings of <a id="l2241"></a>Egypt &amp; Persia but knew nothing of an Assyrian Empire. Ionah <a id="l2242"></a>prophesied when Israel was in affliction under the king of Syria <a id="l2243"></a>&amp; this was in the latter part of the reign of Iehoahaz &amp; first <a id="l2244"></a>part of the reign of Ioas kings of Israel, &amp; by consequence <a id="l2245"></a>about 120 years before the captivity of the ten tribes. Nineveh <a id="l2246"></a>was then a city of large extent, but full of pastures for <a id="l2247"></a>cattel, so that it conteined but about 120000 persons. After <a id="l2248"></a>its captivity it was not yet grown so great &amp; potent as not <a id="l2249"></a>to be terrified at the preaching of Ionah &amp; to fear being <a id="l2250"></a>invaded by its neighbours &amp; ruined within forty days. Its king <a id="l2251"></a>was not yet called king of Assyria but only <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n152-ref">[152]</sup>  king of Nineveh, <a id="l2252"></a>&amp; his Proclamation for a fast was not published in several <a id="l2253"></a>nations nor in all Assyria but only in Nineveh &amp; perhaps the <a id="l2254"></a>villages thereof: but soon after when the dominion of Nineveh <a id="l2255"></a>was established at home &amp; exalted over all Assyria properly so <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p129r"> &lt;129r&gt; </span> called &amp; this kingdom began to make war upon the neigh<a id="l2256"></a>bouring nations, its kings were no longer called kings of  Nineveh but kings of Assyria.</p>
<p id="par96">Amos prophesied in the reign of Ieroboam the son of Ioas <a id="l2258"></a>king of Israel soon after Ieroboam had subdued the kingdoms<sup class="note" id="n153-ref">[153]</sup>  <a id="l2259"></a>of Damascus &amp; Hamath, that is about 70 or 80 years before the <a id="l2260"></a>captivity of the ten Tribes, &amp; he thus reproves Israel for being <a id="l2261"></a>lifted up by those conquests.<sup class="note" id="n154-ref">[154]</sup> <em class="underline">Ye which rejoyce in a thing of nought, <a id="l2262"></a>which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our strength? Be<a id="l2263"></a>hold I will raise up against you a nation, o house of Israel <a id="l2264"></a>saith the Lord, &amp; they shall afflict you from the entring <a id="l2265"></a>in of Hamath unto the river of the wilderness</em>. God here <a id="l2266"></a>threatens to raise up a nation against Israel, but what <a id="l2267"></a>nation he names not. That he conceales till the Assyrians <a id="l2268"></a>should appear &amp; discover it. In the prophesies of Isaiah, Ieremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Micah, Nahum, Zephany &amp; <a id="l2269"></a>Zechary, which were written after this Monarchy grew up, <a id="l2270"></a>its openly named upon all occasions; but in this of Amos <a id="l2271"></a>not once, tho the captivity of Syria &amp; Israel be the <a id="l2272"></a>subject of the prophesy &amp; that of Israel be often <a id="l2273"></a>threatened. He only saith in general that Syria should <a id="l2274"></a>go into captivity unto Kir, &amp; that Israel notwithstand<a id="l2275"></a>ing her present greatness should go into captivity beyond <a id="l2276"></a>Damascus, &amp; that God would raise up a nation to afflict <a id="l2277"></a>them, meaning that he would raise up above them from <a id="l2278"></a>a lower condition a nation whom they yet feared not. <a id="l2279"></a>ffor so the Hebrew word חקם signifies when applied <a id="l2280"></a>to men, as in Amos. 5.2. 1 Sam. 2.8. 2 Sam.12.11 Psal.113.<a id="l2281"></a>7. Ier 10.20, &amp; 50.32 Hab. 1.6. Zech. 11.16 Amos mentions <a id="l2282"></a>the Assyrians but once, &amp; it is only to tell us that they <a id="l2283"></a>had been in captivity. Have not I brought up Israel <a id="l2284"></a>out of the land of Egypt, &amp; the Philistims from Caphtor, <a id="l2285"></a>&amp; the Assyrians form Kir? Amos. 9.7. They were therefore <a id="l2286"></a>returned from captivity, &amp; at the writing of this prophe<a id="l2287"></a>sy made no great figure in the world, but were to be <a id="l2288"></a>raised up against Israel &amp; by consequence rose up  <a id="l2289"></a>in the days of Pul &amp; his successors. For after Ieroboam <a id="l2290"></a>had conquered Damascus &amp; Hamath, his successor Mena<a id="l2291"></a>hem destroyed Tipsah with its territories upon Euphrates <a id="l2292"></a>because in his expedition against Shallum who usurped <a id="l2293"></a>the crown, they opened not to him. And therefore Israel <a id="l2294"></a>continued in its greatness till Pul (probably grown formi<a id="l2295"></a>dable by some victories) caused Menahem to buy his <a id="l2296"></a>peace. Pul therefore reigning presently after the pro<a id="l2297"></a>phesy of Amos, &amp; being the first upon record who began <a id="l2298"></a>to fulfill it, may be justly recconed the first conqueror <a id="l2299"></a>&amp; founder of this empire.</p>
<p id="par97">I have hitherto taken a view of the times reputed fabulous by <a id="l2300"></a>the Greeks &amp; Latines, &amp; shewed that before the reign of Pul &amp; the <a id="l2301"></a>beginning of the Olympiads there were no great empires in the world <a id="l2302"></a>except that of Egypt founded by Ammon &amp; Sesak which was but of short <a id="l2303"></a>continuance.  Towns began <a id="l2304"></a>to be built in Europe not above  an hundred &amp; eighty years before the Argo<a id="l2305"></a>nautick expedition, &amp; the founder of every town was its first <a id="l2306"></a>king. The first city that reigned over all Italy was Rome, &amp; the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p130r"> &lt;130r&gt; </span> first that reigned over all Greece was Macedon. Media  <a id="l2307"></a>before the days of Dejoces was peopled by villages, &amp; Ecbatane was <a id="l2308"></a>the first city of the Medes which reigned over all the rest as He<a id="l2309"></a>rodotus relates. Nineveh was the first capital city of all Assyria <a id="l2310"></a>Babylon the first of all Chaldea Thebes the first of all Egypt, &amp; Ierusalem the first of all Pheni<a id="l2311"></a>cia  from Egypt to Euphrates. Phenicia  &amp; the regions upon <a id="l2312"></a>Tigris were but thinly peopled in the days of the Patriarchs. Four <a id="l2313"></a>kings from the  coasts of Shinar &amp; Elam invaded &amp; spoiled the <a id="l2314"></a>Rephaims &amp; the  inhabitants of the countries of Moab Ammon <a id="l2315"></a>Edom &amp; Amaleck &amp; the Ammorites &amp; kings of Sodom, Gomorrha, Adma <a id="l2316"></a>&amp; Zeboim, &amp; yet were  pursued &amp; beaten by Abraham &amp; three <a id="l2317"></a>other kings of Canaan with an armed force of only 318 men. <a id="l2318"></a>The Patriarchs <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>fed<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> their flocks wherever they pleased the ground being not yet appropriated. And Egypt was so thinly peopled that Pharaoh said of the Israelites <a id="l2319"></a>Behold the people of the children of Israel are more  &amp; mightier <a id="l2320"></a>then we, &amp; to prevent their multiplying caused their male children <a id="l2321"></a>to be drowned.  The chariots of iron of all Egypt in the days of Moses were <a id="l2322"></a>but 600 &amp; the chariots of Iabin king of Hazor in the land of <a id="l2323"></a>Canaan in the days of  Debarah &amp; Barak were 900. The Canaanites <a id="l2324"></a> spread &amp; gave new names to places &amp; built new cities <a id="l2325"></a>all the days of the Patriarchs, &amp; the cities continued each under its <a id="l2326"></a>own king till the days of Ioshua, &amp; the Canaanites that fled from Ioshuah con<a id="l2327"></a>quered  Egypt. And while the world was but thinly peopled <a id="l2328"></a>&amp; kingdoms were small &amp; numerous &amp; letters were not yet in use <a id="l2329"></a>an exact account of particular kingdoms is not to be expected <a id="l2330"></a>for want of sufficient records. It may suffice to have <a id="l2331"></a>shewed in general that the antiquities of the Egyptians <a id="l2332"></a>Syrians Assyrians Chaldeans &amp; Greeks are made too great by the <a id="l2333"></a>heathens  &amp; to have given an idea of the dark ages <a id="l2334"></a>more consistent with the course of nature &amp; more consonant <a id="l2335"></a>to the scriptures which are by far the oldest records now extant. <a id="l2336"></a>And having brought down this general account of the times <a id="l2337"></a>to the beginning of the Olympiads &amp; Æra of Nabonassar <a id="l2338"></a>without undertaking to be exact in the histories of particular <a id="l2339"></a>kingdoms, it remains now that I proceed to consider the <a id="l2340"></a>great Empires which have risen since the end of the fabulous <a id="l2341"></a>ages; beginning with the Olympiads &amp; Æra of Nabonasser.</p>

<p id="par98">Eygpt, called in scripture Misor Misraim &amp; the land of Ham, <a id="l2344"></a>is a long and broad valley or meadow on both sides the Nile between <a id="l2345"></a>mountains and desarts, running north and south from Syene to the <a id="l2346"></a>Mediterranean. It consisted of two regions,   the upper  lying on both sides the <a id="l2348"></a>single stream of the Nile &amp; the lower lying upon the mouths <a id="l2349"></a>of the Nile in the form of a triangle about 3600 furlongs in <a id="l2350"></a>compass. This lower was called Delta by the Greeks &amp; Rahab  <a id="l2351"></a>in scripture. The upper was again divided into two parts the <a id="l2352"></a> southern called Thebais &amp; in scripture the land of Pathros <a id="l2353"></a>&amp; the northern called by the Greeks Heptanomis &amp;  Arcadia. The Metropolis <a id="l2354"></a>of Thebais was Thebes called in Scripture Ammon No (now <a id="l2355"></a>corruptly Minis) that is the city of Ammon or Iupiter, or (as <a id="l2356"></a>the seventy interpret) Diospolis. It stood on both sides the Nile <a id="l2357"></a>at the distance of about 840 stadia below the less Catarract. <a id="l2358"></a>Below it on the western side of the Nile was the city This.

<p id="par117">The 15<sup>th</sup> 16<sup>th</sup> &amp; 17<sup>th</sup> Dynasty is of the Shepherds &amp; they <a id="l2559"></a>invaded Egypt after Moses had led the Israelites out of it as I <a id="l2560"></a>shall shew hereafter.

<p id="par120">Eratosthenes has given us a series or Canon of 38 kings <a id="l2577"></a>of Thebes beginning with Menes &amp; differing from the Canons <a id="l2578"></a>of Manetho. In the title of the Canon according to the edition <a id="l2579"></a>of Africanus, the first king Menes is said to begin his reign <a id="l2580"></a>in the 10<sup>th</sup> year of the reign of the Phenician Shepherds in <a id="l2581"></a>Egypt. The first nineteen kings in this canon reigned 574 <a id="l2582"></a>years &amp; the 20<sup>th</sup> 21<sup>th</sup> &amp; 22<sup>th</sup> kings called Apappus Echeseos <a id="l2583"></a>&amp; Nitocris seem to be the same with Phiops Methesuphis <a id="l2584"></a>&amp; Nitocris the three last kings of Memphys in the sixt Dynas<a id="l2585"></a>ty of Manetho. ffor Apappus &amp; Phiops  reigned each <a id="l2586"></a>one hundred years &amp; therefore are  one &amp; the same king. <a id="l2587"></a>Echeseos &amp; Methusuphis reigned each one year &amp; Nitocris was <a id="l2588"></a>a Queen of the same name in both canons. Now before <a id="l2589"></a>these  two kings &amp; one Queen of Memphys reigned  20 other kings of <a id="l2590"></a>Memphys whose reign took up 586 years according to the <a id="l2591"></a>3<sup>d</sup> 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; 6<sup>th</sup> Dynasties of Manetho, &amp; therefore Menes the <a id="l2592"></a>first king of Thebes in the canon of Eratosthenes began his <a id="l2593"></a>reign later by 12 years then the first king of Memphys in <a id="l2594"></a>the Dynasties of Manetho,  that is at the same time with <a id="l2595"></a>Menes the first king of This. For he began his reign eleven years <a id="l2596"></a>later then the said first king of Memphys as above.  Also both <a id="l2597"></a>kings (Menes of Thebes &amp; Menes of This) reigned above 60 years <a id="l2598"></a>so that their reigns were contemporary &amp; he of Thebes is in the <a id="l2599"></a>Canon called <em class="underline">Menes Thebennites</em> [read Thinites] that is Menes of This <a id="l2600"></a>so that they were the same king.</p>
<p id="par121">From all which it seems to me that in the Dynasties of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p137r"> &lt;137r&gt; </span> Manetho &amp; Eratosthenes there is nothing so ancient as the <a id="l2601"></a>coming of Israel out of Egypt. And yet the Egyptian Priests <a id="l2602"></a>by summing up  the years of all the Dynasties together have <a id="l2603"></a>made their kingdom much older then the creation of the world: <a id="l2604"></a>which shews that they they knew not when their kings reigned. <a id="l2605"></a>In these Dynasties the kings seem to be often set out of order insomuch that its difficult to find above two or three together in due order of time &amp; their <a id="l2606"></a>names  are much corrupted &amp; some of them were perhaps only brothers or sisters of Kings or Viceroys or Secretaries of State <a id="l2607"></a>,  &amp; the same King is named several times, the Priests of Egypt affecting by naming many kings &amp; adding Dynasty to Dynasty, to make their nation look ancient. According to these Dynasties set in order as above there were in the days of the Iudges of Israel many kingdoms in Egypt all which united into one Monarchy before the reign of Sesostris. But whether those kingdoms were so ancient as the Dynasties make them may be doubted. For by further examining the order of the kings we shal find hereafter that several kings reigned after Sesostris who in the Dynasties are named before him</p>
<p id="par122">Sometime after the departure of the Israelites out of <a id="l2611"></a>Eygpt the Shepherds from the east invaded &amp; conquered Timaus<sup class="note" id="n164-ref">[164]</sup>  <a id="l2612"></a>king of the lower Egypt &amp; burnt the cities &amp; subverted the <a id="l2613"></a>Temples of the Egyptians &amp; reduced the people into servitude <a id="l2614"></a>&amp; at length creating a king over them they fortified the city Abaris &amp; reigning there a long time had various warrs with the kings <a id="l2615"></a>of the higher  parts of Eygpt. This invasion I place after <a id="l2616"></a>the departure of Israel out of Egypt because during their stay <a id="l2617"></a>in Eygpt there is no mention of Shepherds or Arabians or Cana<a id="l2618"></a>anites there but Pharoah &amp; all his people are constantly spoken of as <a id="l2619"></a>Eygptians. The Israelites had been in Egypt 215 years &amp; yet remained <a id="l2620"></a>a distinct people so as not to be called Egyptians &amp; the <a id="l2621"></a>Shepherds after they invaded Egypt remained also a distinct people because the Egyptians <a id="l2622"></a>at length drove them out of Egypt.<sup class="note" id="n165-ref">[165]</sup>  The Egyptians abominated <a id="l2623"></a>Shepherds &amp; would not so much as eat with them &amp; by way of <a id="l2624"></a>distinction <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n166-ref">[166]</sup>  called the kings of the Shepherds Hicsos, that is Shepherd kings. And <a id="l2626"></a>they differed also in religion the Shepherds sacrificing men <a id="l2627"></a>after the manner of the Canaanites &amp;  nations of Arabia <a id="l2628"></a> but the Egyptians abolishing <a id="l2629"></a>such sacrifices. But in the story of Moses the king of Egypt <a id="l2630"></a>under whom Israel was in bondage was called Pharaoh like the <a id="l2631"></a>kings of the  royal line of the Egyptians, &amp; he &amp; his cap<a id="l2632"></a>tains &amp; army &amp; all his people except the Israelites are considered <a id="l2633"></a>as one nation &amp; called Egyptians without distinction. Pharaoh <a id="l2634"></a>sought the life of Moses for killing an Egyptian (Exod. 2.15) <a id="l2635"></a>The Iews were in bondage under the Egyptians (Exod. 3.8, 9) The <a id="l2636"></a>tenn plagues fell on the Egyptians &amp; the Egyptians were drowned <a id="l2637"></a>in the red sea. Not one word in all the story of any other people <a id="l2638"></a>then  Egyptians &amp; Israelites. And it is further to be observ<a id="l2639"></a>ed that the worship of the calf which Israel brought out of Egypt <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p138r"> &lt;138r&gt; </span> was not that of the Canaanites or Arabians but that which the <a id="l2640"></a>genuine Egyptians paid to their Gods . And Pharaoh feared least <a id="l2641"></a>upon any incursion of forreigners Israel should help them &amp; <a id="l2642"></a>go with them out of the land. And as shepherds were an abomi<a id="l2643"></a>nation to the Egyptians in the days of Iacob so the sacrifices of <a id="l2644"></a>Shepherds were an abomination to the Egyptians in the days of <a id="l2645"></a>Moses (Exod. 10.9)  These Egyptians therefore <a id="l2647"></a>were not the kingdom of Shepherds, but that kingdom either <a id="l2648"></a>ceased before the days of Iacob or was set up after the days <a id="l2649"></a>of Moses.</p>
<p id="par123">These shepherds, saith Manetho,<sup class="note" id="n167-ref">[167]</sup>  first seated themselves <a id="l2650"></a>in Egypt without warr &amp; then  gaining the <a id="l2651"></a>Princes of the region where they were they invaded the cities <a id="l2652"></a>of Egypt with great violence &amp; reducing them into servitude <a id="l2653"></a>at length made Salatis their King. He took Memphys and <a id="l2654"></a>built &amp; fortified Abaris or Pelusium  strongly with a wall <a id="l2655"></a>&amp; numerous garison. After him reigned sucessively Beon <a id="l2656"></a>Apacnas, Apophis, Ianias or Staan, Assis or Arcles &amp; many <a id="l2657"></a>others. Their city Abaris the Egyptians accounted the city of <a id="l2658"></a>Typhon calling it Sethron from Seth a name of Typhon, &amp; <a id="l2659"></a>the country about Abaris was long after the fall of this <a id="l2660"></a>kingdom called Bucolica  because the Shepherds there fed <a id="l2661"></a>their heards &amp; flocks.  These shepherds like the people of Phenicia <a id="l2664"></a>&amp; Arabia sacrificed men &amp; in Busiris a city in the middle of <a id="l2665"></a>the Delta the Egyptians long after the expultion of these <a id="l2666"></a>Shepherds continued to beat themselves in their worship<sup class="note" id="n168-ref">[168]</sup>  &amp; some <a id="l2667"></a>cut their foreheads after the manner of the Priests of Baal<sup class="note" id="n169-ref">[169]</sup>  the <a id="l2668"></a>God of the Zidonians. At the Tomb or Temple of Osiris they sacrificed red <a id="l2669"></a>men because Typhon was red &amp; few Eygptians being found of that <a id="l2670"></a>colour they usually sacrificed strangers,  In Heliopolis they sacrificed three men daily till one <a id="l2672"></a>of the kings of Egypt whom Manetho calls Amosis having taken <a id="l2673"></a>that city from them abolished those sacrifices by substituting <a id="l2674"></a>waxen images of men. At length therefore Misphragmuthosis king of <a id="l2675"></a>Thebais drave them out of almost all Eygpt &amp; made them retire <a id="l2676"></a>into the the city Abaris where they walled in tenn thousand Acres <a id="l2677"></a>of land &amp; shut themselves up, &amp; his son &amp; successor Tuthmosis <a id="l2678"></a>or Thummosis or (as Appian the Gramniunan &amp; others call him) Amosis beseiged them there &amp; covenanted with them that <a id="l2679"></a>they should leave Egypt &amp; go whether they pleased &amp; thereupon <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p139r"> &lt;139r&gt; </span> saith Manetho, they went out of Eygpt through the Desart into <a id="l2680"></a>Syria.</p>
<p id="par124">Hence Manetho concludes that they were  the <a id="l2681"></a>Israelites. Others take them for Arabians. Africanus speaking of <a id="l2682"></a>the first six kings saith they were Phenicians. Ησαν δὲ Φοίνικες <a id="l2683"></a>ξενοι βασιλεις 5. Bochartus makes them a colony of Phenici<a id="l2684"></a>ans &amp; interprets the names of the first six kings in the Phenician <a id="l2685"></a>language. And Ierome saith of the language of Canaan, <em class="underline">Inter <a id="l2686"></a>Ægyptiam &amp; Hebræam media est et Hebrææ magna ex parte confinis.</em> <a id="l2687"></a>Its  between the Egyptian &amp; Hebrew &amp; for the most part comes <a id="l2688"></a>neare the Hebrew. Which is a strong argument that the Canaanites were mixt of people who had conversed in Eygpt  later then the Hebrews had done. The Canaanites were shepherds &amp; lay next <a id="l2689"></a>Egypt &amp; the main body of the Arabians lay at a greater distance <a id="l2690"></a>from Egypt with Edom between &amp; so were less likely to invade it. <a id="l2691"></a>ffor Edom lay before Egypt <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n170-ref">[170]</sup>  extending from Canaan to the Red <a id="l2692"></a>Sea &amp; the Edomites kept their seats.</p>
<p id="par125">Herodotus tells us that a region in Memphys round the temple <a id="l2693"></a>of Proteus was inhabited by Tyrian Phenicians all which place <a id="l2694"></a>was called the camp of the Tyrians. Probably these were the <a id="l2695"></a>reliques of the Shepherds. He tells us also of a city in the Delta <a id="l2696"></a>called Atarbechis in which was a temple of Venus. And by the <a id="l2697"></a>name of the city this Venus seems to be the Venus of the <a id="l2698"></a>Phœnicians  called Atargatis. The name is corruptly formed of <a id="l2699"></a>Aster-dag, &amp; signifies a Queen of Shepherds heardsmen &amp; marriners the word <em class="underline">Aster</em>, &amp; in the plural number Asteroth <a id="l2700"></a>signifying heards of cattel &amp; flocks of sheep &amp; the word <em class="underline">dag</em> <a id="l2701"></a>a fish. As a Queen of Shepherds &amp; heardsmen she wore upon <a id="l2702"></a>her head the head of an Ox (that is a diadem so formed) <a id="l2703"></a>&amp; was called Astaroth, Astarte, Athara, &amp; as a Queen of <a id="l2704"></a>Mariners she was sometimes formed like a fish below <a id="l2705"></a>&amp; then called Atargatis, Derceto,  &amp; here in <a id="l2706"></a>Herodotus Atarbechis. When any bulls died in Egypt it <a id="l2707"></a>was the custome of the Egyptians to bury them neare <a id="l2708"></a>their cities with one or two horns above ground for a signe <a id="l2709"></a>&amp; after a certain time when their bodies were rotted away <a id="l2710"></a>the inhabitants of this city Atarbechis came to the cities <a id="l2711"></a>of Egypt in ships, dug up the bones, carried them away to <a id="l2712"></a>a common burying place &amp; there buried them together. This <a id="l2713"></a>service imposed by the Egyptians upon the inhabitants of <a id="l2714"></a>this city implies that they were the remains of ancient heards<a id="l2715"></a>men who had left a brood of cattel scattered over the land <a id="l2716"></a>of Egypt, &amp; their Goddess Atarbechis after whom according to the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p140r"> &lt;140r&gt; </span> custome of the Egyptians who named their cities from their Gods) the city seems to be named implies that <a id="l2717"></a>they were Phenicians. </p>
<p id="par126">Lucian tells us<sup class="note" id="n171-ref">[171]</sup>  that the Phœnicians had a Temple which <a id="l2721"></a>was not Assyrian but Ægyptian &amp; came into Phœnicia from <a id="l2722"></a>Heliopolis &amp; was large &amp; very ancient. He tells us also that at <a id="l2723"></a>Biblais they had another large Temple dedicated to Venus  <a id="l2724"></a>in which they worshipped Adonis &amp; every year beat themselves <a id="l2725"></a>&amp; lamented his death throughout the whole region &amp; then <a id="l2726"></a>performed to him a sacrifice of the dead &amp; shaved their heads <a id="l2727"></a>after the manner of the Egyptians when their Apis was dead. <a id="l2728"></a>And some of Biblus affirmed that under the name of Adonis <a id="l2729"></a>the Egyptian Osiris was worshipped &amp; all this mourning performed <a id="l2730"></a>to him, &amp; that he was buried at Biblus, &amp; they confirmed their <a id="l2731"></a>opinion by this ceremony that the head of Osiris was every <a id="l2732"></a>year brought out of Egypt to Biblos in a ship, &amp;, saith Lucian <a id="l2733"></a>I saw this head formed of the Egyptian papyr. This custome <a id="l2734"></a>it seems they took to be in remembrance of the bringing of <a id="l2735"></a>the true head of Osiris out of Egypt to be buried at Biblus &amp; <a id="l2736"></a>upon that opinion grownded their worship. So then Adonis, Venus <a id="l2737"></a>&amp; the Boar are but other names of Osiris, Isis &amp; Typhon, &amp; <a id="l2738"></a>the worship of Adonis &amp; his Venus is Egyptian. All which are <a id="l2739"></a>further arguments that the Phœnicians came out of Egypt. <a id="l2740"></a>And its probable also that they brought their Hercules from <a id="l2741"></a>thence.</p>
<p id="par127">It seems to me therefore that as when David invaded <a id="l2742"></a>Edom &amp; Nebuchadnezzar invaded Iudea the invaded people retired <a id="l2743"></a>into Eygpt, so when Ioshua invaded Canaan &amp; drave out the in<a id="l2744"></a>habitants they retired in great numbers into Egypt &amp;  &amp; seated themselves about Abaris where they <a id="l2746"></a>found pasturage for their cattel, &amp;  when they found themselves numerous &amp; strong enough <a id="l2749"></a>they made warr upon Timaus king of the Egyptians (whom <a id="l2750"></a>perhaps Ezekiel calls Tammuz) &amp; overthrew the kingdom of <a id="l2751"></a>Ramesses &amp; staying long in Eygpt used themselves to naviga<a id="l2752"></a>tion upon the river Nile &amp; when they were   driven out of Egypt retired into Phœnicia, &amp; mixing with the Phœnicians some of them applied themselves to sea-affairs.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p141r"> &lt;141r&gt; </span>
<p id="par128">Polemo in the first book of his Greek histories saith expresly <a id="l2755"></a>that in the time of Apis the son of Phoroneus part of the Egyp<a id="l2756"></a>tian army withdrew it self from Egypt &amp; seated it self on Pa<a id="l2757"></a>lestine not far from Arabia. Africanus in citing this passage<sup class="note" id="n172-ref">[172]</sup>  <a id="l2758"></a>thinks that Polemo understood the Israelites led out of Egypt by <a id="l2759"></a>Moses. And Manetho tells us that when the shepherds were <a id="l2760"></a>expelled Egypt they went through the wilderness into Syria &amp; <a id="l2761"></a>built a city in the land which is now called Iudea which might <a id="l2762"></a>suffice for so many people &amp; called it Ierusalem. He confounds <a id="l2763"></a>the Shepherds with the Israelites as if the Israelites were the <a id="l2764"></a>Shepherds expelled by Misphragmuthosis &amp; upon their coming <a id="l2765"></a>out of Egypt seated themselves in Palestine &amp; built Ierusalem <a id="l2766"></a>whereas the Israelites came out of Egypt before the shepherds <a id="l2767"></a>went into it. But however he lets us understand that when <a id="l2768"></a>the shepherds were expelled Egypt they returned into Phenicia <a id="l2769"></a>their original country, &amp; there seated themselves, &amp; that this <a id="l2770"></a>was done a little before the seventh year of David. For <a id="l2771"></a>David reigned seven years in Hebron &amp; then smote the Iebusites <a id="l2772"></a>&amp; took from them Iebus which is Ierusalem &amp; reigned there 33 <a id="l2773"></a>years more &amp; built Ierusalem round about.</p>
<p id="par129">Diodorus in his 40<sup>th</sup> Book<sup class="note" id="n173-ref">[173]</sup> saith that in Egypt there were <a id="l2774"></a>formerly multitudes of strangers of several nations who used <a id="l2775"></a>forreign rites and ceremonies in worshipping the Gods for which they <a id="l2776"></a>were expelled Egypt &amp; under Danaus Cadmus &amp; other skilfull <a id="l2777"></a>commanders after great hardships came into Greece &amp; other places <a id="l2778"></a>but the greatest part of them came into Iudea not far from <a id="l2779"></a>Egypt a country then uninhabited &amp; desart being conducted thither <a id="l2780"></a>by one Moses a wise &amp; valiant man; who after he had possest <a id="l2781"></a>himself of the country among other cities built Ierusalem &amp; <a id="l2782"></a>the Temple. Diodorus here mistakes the original of the Israe<a id="l2783"></a>lites as Manetho had done before, but thereby lets us know <a id="l2784"></a>that the shepherds were expelled Egypt  a little before the building <a id="l2785"></a>of Ierusalem &amp; the Temple &amp; after several hardships some <a id="l2786"></a>of them came into Greece &amp; other places under the conduct of <a id="l2787"></a>Cadmus &amp; other captains, but the most of them setled in Phœnicia <a id="l2788"></a>next Eygpt. We may reccon therefore that the wars between the <a id="l2789"></a> King of Thebais &amp; the shepherds were the occasion that in those days <a id="l2790"></a>so many men came with Colonies out of Egypt &amp; Phenicia into Greece <a id="l2791"></a>as Cecrops, Selex, Inachus, Cadmus, Erectheus, Peteos, ; &amp; that these things <a id="l2792"></a>happened in the reign of  Eli, Samuel &amp; David,  Cadmus <a id="l2793"></a>being contemporary to David as was shewed above.</p>
<p id="par130">When the Israelites came out of Egypt God led them not through <a id="l2794"></a>the way of the land of the Philistims although that was near, for <a id="l2795"></a>God said, Least peradventure the people repent when they see war <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p142r"> &lt;142r&gt; </span> and they return into Egypt, but God led the people about through <a id="l2796"></a>the way of the wilderness of the Red sea Exod. 13.7. And there<a id="l2797"></a>fore the shepherds upon leaving Egypt were to expect war <a id="l2798"></a>with the Philistims unles they took care to prevent it by a treaty.</p>
<p id="par131">Manetho tells us that Thummosis besieged the shepherds in <a id="l2799"></a>Abaris untill he despaired of forcing them &amp; then covenanted <a id="l2800"></a>with them that if they would leave Egypt  they should <a id="l2801"></a>go safely whether they pleased &amp; thereupon they went out of <a id="l2802"></a>Egypt through the Desart into Syria with all their possessions <a id="l2803"></a>&amp; families to the number of 240000. They were not beaten <a id="l2804"></a>out of Egypt but retired quietly with their heards &amp; flocks <a id="l2805"></a>&amp; wives &amp; childred upon a compact that they should not be <a id="l2806"></a>pursued or hurt in their retiring. And since they did not <a id="l2807"></a>retire till they had taken care of a safe retreat, it may <a id="l2808"></a>be presumed that they did not retire till they had taken <a id="l2809"></a>care of a place into which they might safely retreat, &amp; <a id="l2810"></a>for that end had treated with the Philistims the nation which <a id="l2811"></a>lay next Egypt in their way  towards Syria.</p>
<p id="par132">The Philistims in those days reigned long over Israel <a id="l2812"></a>so as to give the name of Palestine to the whole land of <a id="l2813"></a>Canaan.

But afterwards they became again Lords <a id="l2820"></a>over  Israel before Saul was chosen King (1 Sam. 9.16) <a id="l2821"></a>&amp; then put Garrisons in the land &amp; suffered not a Smith to be <a id="l2822"></a>in the land of Israel least the Israelites should make them<a id="l2823"></a>selves swords and spears, but the Israelites went to the Arti<a id="l2824"></a>ficers of the Philistims to sharpen their shares &amp; coulters <a id="l2825"></a>&amp; axes &amp; mattocks. And in the second year of Saul when <a id="l2826"></a>Ionathan smote a Garrison of the Philistims the Philistims <a id="l2827"></a>came against Saul with an army of thirty thousand chariots <a id="l2828"></a>&amp; six thousand horsmen &amp; foot as the sand on the sea <a id="l2829"></a>shore in multitude so that the people of Israel were in a <a id="l2830"></a>strait &amp; hid themselves for fear 1 Sam.13. And there was <a id="l2831"></a>thence forward sore war against the Philistims all the days <a id="l2832"></a>of Saul, &amp; when Saul saw any strong or valiant man <a id="l2833"></a>he took him unto him (1 Sam. 14.52) nor could the Philistims <a id="l2834"></a>be subdued any more till David had beaten them in many <a id="l2835"></a>battels. Now the very great numbers of the Philistims in the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p143r"> &lt;143r&gt; </span> beginning of their war with Saul &amp; David &amp; the greatness <a id="l2836"></a>of their power in this war above what it was in the  <a id="l2837"></a>war with Samuel implies an access of forces &amp; seems no <a id="l2838"></a>way to be so well accounted for as by supposing that when <a id="l2839"></a>the Philistims being beaten by Samuel found themselves <a id="l2840"></a>too weak for the Hebrews &amp; the shepherds being besieged  <a id="l2841"></a>in Abaris found themselves too weak for the Egyptians, the <a id="l2842"></a>Philistims &amp; Shepherds agreed to assist one another &amp; the <a id="l2843"></a>Philistims thereupon received the shepherds into their terri<a id="l2844"></a>tories &amp; joyntly with them made war upon &amp; subdued the <a id="l2845"></a>Hebrews till Saul revolted &amp; he &amp; David by a tedious &amp; difficult <a id="l2846"></a>war recovered the liberty of the Hebrews.</p>
<p id="par133">And all this is the more probable because if the Shep<a id="l2847"></a>herds went out of Egypt into Palestine just before Saul <a id="l2848"></a>revolted from the Philistims, it was easy for Manetho &amp; Dio<a id="l2849"></a>dorus to take the revolting Israelites for the Shepherds &amp; so <a id="l2850"></a>to ascribe the building of Ierusalem &amp; the Temple to them <a id="l2851"></a>as if the wars which Saul &amp; David made upon the Philistims <a id="l2852"></a>were those by which the shepherds seated themselves in Pa<a id="l2853"></a>lestine. For the heathen historians knew that the Israelites <a id="l2854"></a>came out of Egypt but how &amp; when they came out they did <a id="l2855"></a>not know, nor that more nations then one came out of <a id="l2856"></a>Egypt &amp; invaded Palestine successively; &amp; therefore they <a id="l2857"></a>took the two nations of the Israelites &amp; Shepherds to be one <a id="l2858"></a>&amp; the same nation, &amp; some historians hearing that Moses <a id="l2859"></a>led the Israelites out of Egypt took him to be the captain <a id="l2860"></a>of the shepherds.</p>
<p id="par134">About the time that Saul reigned when the Philistims <a id="l2861"></a>strengthened by the access of the shepherds were in their greatest <a id="l2862"></a>power they besieged &amp; took Zidon &amp; thereby gave occasion to the <a id="l2863"></a>building of Tyre as Trogus in his 18<sup>th</sup> Book thus mentions. <em class="underline">A <a id="l2864"></a>rege Ascaloniorum expugnati Sidonij navibus appulsi Tyrum <a id="l2865"></a>urbem ante annum Trojanæ cladis condiderunt. Sidon being <a id="l2866"></a>sackt by the King of Ascalon the Sidonians fled in Ships to Tyre <a id="l2867"></a>&amp; built that city before the year of the destruction of Troy.</em> <a id="l2868"></a>And hence Isaiah calls Tyre the daughter of Zidon, the inhabi<a id="l2869"></a>tants of the Isle whom the merchants of Zidon have replenished. <a id="l2870"></a>This original of Tyre I understand not of the first building of the <a id="l2871"></a>town which Iosephus saith was 240 years before the building <a id="l2872"></a>of Solomons Temple but of the making it a populous trading <a id="l2873"></a>City like that of Zidon &amp; building it accordingly. For the Zi<a id="l2874"></a>donians built it for that purpose. And this seems to have been <a id="l2875"></a>in the days of Hiram &amp; his father Abibalus the two first Kings <a id="l2876"></a>of Tyre named in history. For Iosephus tells us<sup class="note" id="n174-ref">[174]</sup>  out of Menander <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p144r-b"> &lt;144r&gt; </span> &amp; Dius that Hiram king of Tyre succeeding his father Abiba<a id="l2877"></a>lus added a large region to the Island eastward by heaping up earth <a id="l2878"></a>&amp; built the city greater &amp; the Temple of Iupiter Olympus <a id="l2879"></a>which was in an Island he joyned to the city by a ridge of earth <a id="l2880"></a>thrown between them &amp; adorned the Temple with guifts of <a id="l2881"></a>gold &amp; demolishing the old Temples built new ones &amp; dedicated <a id="l2882"></a>the Temples of Hercules and Astartes. Kings upon founding <a id="l2883"></a>or much enlarging their kingdoms usually build their <a id="l2884"></a>cities more sumptuous as David &amp; Solomon did Ierusalem <a id="l2885"></a>&amp; the Temple, Sesostris the cities &amp; temples of Eygpt, Nebu<a id="l2886"></a>chadnezzar the city Babylon, Deioces Ecbatane &amp; Augustus <a id="l2887"></a>Rome, &amp; accordingly the building of Tire by Hiram argues <a id="l2888"></a>a new dominion of the Tyrians. Now that this was the <a id="l2889"></a>building of Tyre mentioned by Trogus may be concluded <a id="l2890"></a>from hence that Solomon in the beginning of his reign called <a id="l2891"></a>the servants of Hiram Zidonians. <em class="underline">My servants</em>, saith he, <a id="l2892"></a><em class="underline">shall be with thy servants &amp; unto thee will I give hire <a id="l2893"></a>for thy servants according to all that thou desirest, for thou <a id="l2894"></a>knowest that there is not amongst us any that can skill to <a id="l2895"></a>hew timber like unto the Zidonians</em>1 King. 5.6. The new <a id="l2896"></a>inhabitants of Tire had not yet lost the name of Zidonians <a id="l2897"></a>nor had the old inhabitants (if there were any considerable <a id="l2898"></a>number of them) gained the reputation of the new ones for <a id="l2899"></a>skill in hewing of timber as they would have done had <a id="l2900"></a>shipping been long in use at Tyre. We may reccon there<a id="l2901"></a>fore that the king of Ascalon (one of the five Lords of the <a id="l2902"></a>Philistims) took Zidon in the beginning of the reign of David <a id="l2903"></a>or not long before. For then were the Philisitims most potent <a id="l2904"></a>&amp; active in invading their neighbours &amp; propagating their <a id="l2905"></a>dominion. And from the hostility between the Philistims &amp; <a id="l2906"></a>Sidonians it seems to have happened that David had friend<a id="l2907"></a>ship with the king of Tyre while he made war upon the <a id="l2908"></a>Philistims. So then Ierusalem &amp; Tyre were built about <a id="l2909"></a>the same time as head cities of new kingdoms &amp; thence <a id="l2910"></a>forward continued in a flourishing condition till Nebuchad<a id="l2911"></a>nezzar beseiged &amp; took them.</p>
<p id="par135">The red sea being very shallow &amp; for that reason <a id="l2912"></a>calmer then the Mediterranean, was navigable in smaller <a id="l2913"></a>vessels such as men could make in the beginning. And the <a id="l2914"></a>short voiages between the many Islands with which that sea <a id="l2915"></a>abounded were an invitation to try that sea first. There <a id="l2916"></a>navigation had its rise &amp; was propagated thence to the Me<a id="l2917"></a>diterranean. For Pliny tells us:<sup class="note" id="n175-ref">[175]</sup>  <em class="underline">Nave primus in Greciam ex</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p145r"> &lt;145r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">Ægypto Danaus advenit; ante ratibus navigabatur inventis <a id="l2918"></a>in mari rubro inter insulas a rege Erythra.</em> King Erythra is <a id="l2919"></a>the king of Edom usually supposed to be  Esau. ffor Esau, Edom <a id="l2920"></a>&amp; Erythra are words of the same signification &amp; signify <em class="underline">red</em>.<sup class="note" id="n176-ref">[176]</sup>  <a id="l2921"></a>Whence that sea was called <em class="underline">mare Eyrthræum</em> the red sea or <a id="l2922"></a>sea of Edom. From these Edomites the Phenicians seem to have <a id="l2923"></a>had their rise: for the Phenicians traded first upon the Red sea <a id="l2924"></a>&amp; went  from thence to the Mediterranean, as they them<a id="l2925"></a>selves &amp; the Persians related to Herodotus.<sup class="note" id="n177-ref">[177]</sup>  And so Pliny:<sup class="note" id="n178-ref">[178]</sup>  <em class="underline">Tyrij <a id="l2926"></a>orti ab Erythræo mari ferebantur</em>, &amp; solinus, <em class="underline">Tyrij a mari rubro <a id="l2927"></a>profecti</em>. Hence Dionysius Afer<sup class="note" id="n179-ref">[179]</sup>  calls the Phenicians <em class="underline">Erythreans</em> <a id="l2928"></a>&amp; his old Interpreter thinks the name taken from the Red Sea. <a id="l2929"></a>And Strabo tells us<sup class="note" id="n180-ref">[180]</sup> that <em class="underline">some report that the Phœnicians and <a id="l2930"></a>Sidonians were colonies of the inhabitants of the Ocean &amp; that <a id="l2931"></a>they were called Phenicians</em> [Punici] <em class="underline">because the sea is red</em>.</p>
<p id="par136">How and when the Phenicians came from the red sea may <a id="l2932"></a>be gathered from the history of David. For when David smote <a id="l2933"></a>Edom, Ioab stayed there with all Israel six months untill <a id="l2934"></a>he had smitten every male in Edom. 1 King. 11.15, 16. This made <a id="l2935"></a>Hadad the young King of Edom fly into Egypt with certain <a id="l2936"></a>Edomites his fathers servants, and as many of the Edomites as <a id="l2937"></a>could escape fled to the Philistims &amp; to Sidon &amp; other places <a id="l2938"></a>where they could be protected. For Stephanus in Azot tells us <a id="l2939"></a>τάυτην ἔκτισαν εἱς των ἐπανελθόντων ἀπ᾽ Ερυθρας θαλάσσης <a id="l2940"></a>φευγάδων. <em class="underline">A fugitive or Exul from the Red sea built Azot <a id="l2941"></a>or Ashdod</em>. That is, a fugitive Prince of Edom fortified it against <a id="l2942"></a>the Israelites. By this victory over the Edomites, Ezion Gebar <a id="l2943"></a>&amp; Eloth (sea ports of the Edomites on the Red Sea) came into <a id="l2944"></a>the hands of David &amp; his successors untill the reign of Ioram, that <a id="l2945"></a>is for 150 years or above. And Solomon<sup class="note" id="n181-ref">[181]</sup>  built a Navy in Ezion <a id="l2946"></a>Gebar &amp; sent it on the Red sea with the fleet of Hiram king <a id="l2947"></a>of Tyre to Tarshish &amp; Ophir for gold &amp; silver &amp; ivory <a id="l2948"></a>&amp; Peacocks [or Parrots] &amp; Apes &amp; pretious stones &amp; Almug <a id="l2949"></a>trees; by which means the Queen of Sheba or Sabæa in Arabia <a id="l2950"></a>Felix heard of Solomon's glory; and Hiram sent with Solomons <a id="l2951"></a>servants in Solomon's navy his own servants shipmen who had <a id="l2952"></a>knowledge of the sea. Solomon's servants were therefore novices <a id="l2953"></a>in sea affairs &amp; Hiram's servants were experienced  shipmen who had knowledge of those seas by former voyages, for <a id="l2955"></a>Hiram had also a navy on the Red sea1 King. 10.11, 22. Thus <a id="l2956"></a>the trade of the <em class="underline">Edomites</em> on the Red sea came into the hands <a id="l2957"></a>of Solomon &amp; Hiram until the Egyptians invaded that sea &amp; left only the Mediterranean to the Tyrians.</p>
<p id="par137">In what year the Edomites were vanquished is uncertain. <a id="l2958"></a>If Solomon may be supposed about 22 or 23 years old at <a id="l2959"></a>the birth of his eldest son Rehoboam, since Rehoboam was <a id="l2960"></a>41 years old at the death of Solomon, the birth of Solomon <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p146r"> &lt;146r&gt; </span> will be about the 17<sup>th</sup> year of Davids reign. And since Solomon was <a id="l2961"></a>David's second son by Bathsheba, the seige of Rabbah when David <a id="l2962"></a>first lay with Bathsheba will begin at least two years before <a id="l2963"></a>&amp; in two years before that David had two great victories over <a id="l2964"></a>the Ammonites &amp; Syrians so that the war against them began <a id="l2965"></a>in the 13<sup>th</sup> year of David's reign, &amp; the first 12 years of <a id="l2966"></a>his reign were spent in wars with the house of Saul &amp; <a id="l2967"></a>with the Philistims and Amalekites &amp; Edomites &amp; Moabites <a id="l2968"></a> In the two first years of his reign he warred <a id="l2971"></a>with the house of Saul &amp; his next wars were with <a id="l2972"></a>the Philistims. Then he took Ierusalem &amp; came &amp; dwelt <a id="l2973"></a>there in the eighth year of his reign, &amp; the wars against <a id="l2974"></a>Edom &amp; Moab seem to be in the next four years: so that <a id="l2975"></a>the error cannot be great if we place the flight of the <a id="l2976"></a>Edomites  upon the tenth year of David's reign.</p>
<p id="par138">When the Edomites were driven from their seats it <a id="l2977"></a>may be presumed that they sent out  colonies upon the <a id="l2978"></a>Mediterranean &amp; of this there are footsteps. ffor Herodotus tells us that among the colonies of Cadmus there were Erythræans &amp; Stepha<a id="l2979"></a>nus (in Ερυθράι)  that Erythra was the name of <a id="l2980"></a>a city in Ionia, of another in Lybia, of another in Locris, <a id="l2981"></a>of another in Bœotia &amp; of another in Cyprus. Erythræ <a id="l2982"></a>in Ionia was a seaport town &amp; a colony of forreigners. <a id="l2983"></a>The inhabitants said that they came from Crete<sup class="note" id="n182-ref">[182]</sup>  under <a id="l2984"></a>the conduct of Erythrus the some of Rhadamanthus but <a id="l2985"></a>their God was Phenician;<sup class="note" id="n183-ref">[183]</sup>  for they worshipped the statue <a id="l2986"></a>of Hercules brought from Tyre &amp; in memory of its come<a id="l2987"></a>ing from thence they kept it standing upon the wood of <a id="l2988"></a>the ship which brought it. By their God you may know <a id="l2989"></a>that they were Phœnicians, &amp; by their name that they <a id="l2990"></a>came from the Erythrean sea.</p>
<p id="par139">Herodotus tells us<sup class="note" id="n184-ref">[184]</sup>  that the Phenicians were the <a id="l2991"></a>authors of Dissentions, who coming from the red sea to <a id="l2992"></a>the Mediterranean &amp; seating themselves on the sea coasts <a id="l2993"></a>of Syria, quickly undertook long voyages &amp; in carrying  <a id="l2994"></a>Egyptian &amp; Assyrian wares passed over to other coasts and <a id="l2995"></a>chiefly to Argos: ffor Argos was then the chief city of <a id="l2996"></a>Greece. That the Phenicians coming hither exposed their <a id="l2997"></a>merchandise &amp; after 5 or 6 days, when they had sold almost <a id="l2998"></a>all certain weomen came to the sea<sup class="note" id="n185-ref">[185]</sup>  amongst whom was <a id="l2999"></a>Io the daughter of Inachus. And whilst they bought what <a id="l3000"></a>they liked, the Phenicians set upon them &amp; seizing Io <a id="l3001"></a>&amp; some others, carried them into their ship &amp; sailed into <a id="l3002"></a>Egypt, &amp; this was the beginning of injuries. That in requital <a id="l3003"></a>of this injury, some Greeks of the Island Crete afterwards <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p147r"> &lt;147r&gt; </span> coming to Tyre carried away Europa, and a while after <a id="l3004"></a>the Greeks committed also a second injury in carrying away <a id="l3005"></a>Medea from Colchos. And when the king of Colchos sent an <a id="l3006"></a>Embassadour to demand his daughter back &amp; that the raptors <a id="l3007"></a>might be punished, the Greeks answered that as they (to wit <a id="l3008"></a>the Egyptians of whom the kingdom of Colchos was a colo<a id="l3009"></a>ny) had not punished the raptors of Io, so neither would <a id="l3010"></a>the Greeks punish those of Medea. In the next age Paris <a id="l3011"></a>stole Helena &amp; these things occasioned the ruin of Troy. <a id="l3012"></a>From these passages of Herodotus it appears that the navi<a id="l3013"></a>gation of the Phenician Merchants to Greece began upon <a id="l3014"></a>their coming from the Red Sea, &amp; by consequence that <a id="l3015"></a>the rapture of Io and Europa was not ancienter then the <a id="l3016"></a>reign of David. The Sidonians might have ships before, <a id="l3017"></a>&amp; sail as far as Eygpt, but it doth not appear that they traded with Greece before <a id="l3018"></a>they fled from the Philistims &amp; the Philistims fled from David <a id="l3019"></a>&amp; the merchants of Edom were driven by David from their <a id="l3020"></a>trade upon the red Sea &amp; deprived of their estates &amp; country <a id="l3021"></a>&amp; thereby necessitated to seek out a new trade upon the <a id="l3022"></a>mediterranean for getting a livelyhood. In such vessels as <a id="l3023"></a>were used upon the Red sea they sailed  by the <a id="l3024"></a>shoar of the Mediterranean till they came as far as <a id="l3025"></a>Greece. These vessels were round &amp; continued in use till <a id="l3026"></a>the Egyptians invented long ships in one of which with fifty <a id="l3027"></a>oars Danaus came into Greece. &amp; In imitation of this ship <a id="l3028"></a>the Greeks built the ship Argo.<sup class="note" id="n186-ref">[186]</sup>   At that time masts &amp; sails were also in<a id="l3029"></a>vented by Isis &amp; Neptune &amp; used by  Dædalus , &amp; navigation still <a id="l3030"></a>improving the Phœnicians soon after the Trojan war <a id="l3031"></a>(as Strabo relates)<sup class="note" id="n187-ref">[187]</sup>  sailed to the middle of the coast of <a id="l3032"></a>Afric where they built cities &amp; went out beyond the <a id="l3033"></a>Pillars of Hercules into the Atlantic sea. The Phœnicians <a id="l3034"></a>seem to be chiefly Zidonians: ffor the Edomites fled to <a id="l3035"></a>the enemies of Israel &amp; in those days the Zidonians grew <a id="l3036"></a>famous among the Greeks while Tyre was scarce known <a id="l3037"></a>to them: Homer often mentions Zidon &amp; Zidonians but <a id="l3038"></a>makes no mention of Tyre.</p>
<p id="par140">The expulsion of the Shepherds out of Eygpt Polemo <a id="l3039"></a>places in the time of Apis the son  of Phoroneus as above, but this Apis <a id="l3040"></a>was a little later being supposed by the Greeks to be the <a id="l3041"></a>Egyptian Osiris who was Sesostris as we shal shew hereafter. <a id="l3042"></a>Iustin  Martyr <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n188-ref">[188]</sup> tells us that Moses lived in the days <a id="l3043"></a>of Ogyges &amp; Inachus, &amp; that Apion the son of Possidonius <a id="l3044"></a>in his commentary against the Iews &amp; in his fourth book <a id="l3045"></a>of Histories saith that when Inachus reigned at Argos <a id="l3046"></a>the Iews under the conduct of Moses departed from Amasis <a id="l3047"></a>king of Egypt, and that the same thing is reported by Ptolomy <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p148r"> &lt;148r&gt; </span> the Mendesian an Egyptian Priest who wrote the affairs of <a id="l3048"></a>Egypt, &amp; by Hellanicus &amp; Philocorus who wrote the Acts of <a id="l3049"></a>the Athenians &amp; by Castor &amp; Thallus &amp; Alexander <a id="l3050"></a>Polyhistor.

This was a commodity with which <a id="l3078"></a>Æygpt always abounded &amp; which the new colonies in Greece then wanted. ffor <a id="l3079"></a>plowing &amp; sowing was not yet in use among the Greeks. <a id="l3080"></a>When Solomon desired Hiram king of Tyre to send <a id="l3081"></a>him timber for his buildings,<sup class="note" id="n194-ref">[194]</sup>  he gave Hiram for the <a id="l3082"></a>timber, twenty thousand measures of wheat &amp; twenty <a id="l3083"></a>thousand measures of barly &amp; twenty thousand baths of <a id="l3084"></a>wine &amp; twenty thousand baths of oyle. Whence it seemes <a id="l3085"></a>that the people of Tyre were numerous in proportion to <a id="l3086"></a>the soile so as to want corn &amp; wine &amp; oyle &amp; therefore <a id="l3087"></a>Egypt being neare them they would be apt to send Mer<a id="l3088"></a>chants thither for what corn they wanted; &amp; this might <a id="l3089"></a>occasion a trafic between Egypt &amp; Phœnicia some time <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p149r"> &lt;149r&gt; </span> before the Phœnicians began to sail as for as Greece.

<p id="par143">Erechtheus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n203-ref">[203]</sup>  was the son of Pandion the son of Erechthonius <a id="l3132"></a>&amp; I take Erechthonius to be an Egyptian.

The Greeks not knowing his parents derived him from <a id="l3139"></a>forreigners by a miraculous birth of the earth &amp; the Egyp<a id="l3140"></a>tians recconed his grandson Erechtheus to be <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n204-ref">[204]</sup>  an Egyptian by <a id="l3141"></a>his family. Now Erechthonius being two generation or about <a id="l3142"></a>50 or 60 years older then Erechtheus may be recconed <a id="l3143"></a>contemporary to Samuel &amp; Saul: but I do not take him <a id="l3144"></a>or his son Pandion to have been king of Athens. For <a id="l3145"></a>Erechtheus in a time of famin procured a great quan<a id="l3146"></a>tity of corn from Egypt,<sup class="note" id="n205-ref">[205]</sup>  &amp; for this benefaction the <a id="l3147"></a>people of Athens made him their king &amp; therefore <a id="l3148"></a>he did not inherit his fathers kingdom but succeeded some <a id="l3149"></a>other king, suppose Amphictyon, by right of Election. Cranaus <a id="l3150"></a>the  predecessor of Amphictyon was the <a id="l3151"></a>father of Rharus the father of Celeus &amp; therefore con<a id="l3152"></a>temporary to Erechthonius: for Celeus was contemporary to <a id="l3153"></a>Erechtheus. Whence its probable that Cecrops the Prede<a id="l3154"></a>cessor of Cranaus began his reign in the days of Eli. <a id="l3155"></a> He is recconed one of the first Egyptians <a id="l3156"></a>who led Colonies into Greece.

He came from the province of Sais which lies upon <a id="l3162"></a>the Canobic ostium of the Nile &amp; in sailing from thence <a id="l3163"></a>he came by the sea coasts  of Phenicia &amp; Cyprus  to <a id="l3164"></a>Greece, &amp; seems to be one of the shepherds because <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n207-ref">[207]</sup>  a <a id="l3165"></a>colony which he left in Cyprus sacrificed yearly a <a id="l3166"></a>man to his daughter Agraulis, an impiety which the genuine Egyptians were free from. By the like colo<a id="l3167"></a>nies the sacrificing of men came also into Greece. For Erechtheus <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n208-ref">[208]</sup> sacrificed his daughter &amp; therefore his <a id="l3168"></a>family was also of the race of the shepherds. But <a id="l3169"></a>circumsision, the religion of the genuine Egyptians <a id="l3170"></a>was no where introduced in Greece by any of these colo<a id="l3171"></a>nies. When Cecrops came first into Greece, the Cares <a id="l3172"></a>sailed between the Islands of the Cyclades, &amp; infested the <a id="l3173"></a>sea costs of Attica.

<p id="par151">Cadmus pretending to be sent in quest of his sister Europa <a id="l3267"></a>&amp; coming into Phocis <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n226-ref">[226]</sup>  followed an Ox which he had bought of <a id="l3268"></a>the heardsmen of Pelagon &amp; which was marked in both sides with <a id="l3269"></a>a white spot resembling the full moon. This was in imita<a id="l3270"></a>tion of the Ox Apis &amp; shews that he was of the religion of <a id="l3271"></a>the Egyptians who worshipped that Ox. And thence its proba<a id="l3272"></a>ble that as the Israelites in the time of Moses, &amp; Ieroboam <a id="l3273"></a>in the time of Solomon by staying in Egypt learnt the <a id="l3274"></a>worship of the calf, so did the ancestors of Cadmus in the <a id="l3275"></a>reign of the Shepherds. Strabo <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n227-ref">[227]</sup>  lets us know that the peo<a id="l3276"></a>ple which accompanied Cadmus into Europe were mixt of Phe<a id="l3277"></a>nicians &amp; Arabians: which Arabians I take to be such as <a id="l3278"></a>fled from the red sea &amp; other places to Zidon in the wars <a id="l3279"></a>of David. Conon in his 32<sup>th</sup> Narration saith that when Cad<a id="l3280"></a>mus was sent to seek Europa he was accompanied with Pro<a id="l3281"></a>teus who fearing the tyranny of Busiris  came with Cad<a id="l3282"></a>mus out of Egypt, &amp; married Chrysonome the daughter of <a id="l3283"></a>Clytus king of a region in Thrace &amp; by the assistance of <a id="l3284"></a>Clytus expelled the Bisaltes &amp; became king of their coun<a id="l3285"></a>try. Cadmus therefore came out of Egypt with the shepherds.</p>
<p id="par152">Herodotus tells us<sup class="note" id="n228-ref">[228]</sup> that the Gephyreans, as they themselves <a id="l3286"></a>reported, were originally from  Erythræa. But, saith he, by <a id="l3287"></a>inquiring, I find that they were Phenicians who came with <a id="l3288"></a>Cadmus into Bœotia &amp; dwelt in the Tanagrian country &amp; being <a id="l3289"></a>expelled thence first by the Argives &amp; then by the Bœotians <a id="l3290"></a>they retired to Athens where they built temples which had no<a id="l3291"></a>thing common with other temples but were distinct. He adds <a id="l3292"></a>that the Phenicians who came with Cadmus of whom the Ge<a id="l3293"></a>phyreans were a part, brought many doctrines into Greece, <a id="l3294"></a>&amp; particularly letters, &amp; that the Iones learnt letters of the <a id="l3295"></a>of the <a id="l3296"></a>Phenicians &amp; called them Phenician letters. Since these Gephy<a id="l3297"></a>reans were originally Erythreans, its probable that the city <a id="l3298"></a>Erythra in Bœotia was built by Erythreans who came with Cadmus.</p>
<p id="par153">Some think that the letters which Cadmus brought from <a id="l3299"></a>Phenicia were originally from Egypt, which is improbable because <a id="l3300"></a>Cecrops Erichthonius &amp; Lelex came from Egypt before <a id="l3301"></a>without letters. Navigation &amp; merchandise occasioned the <a id="l3302"></a>invention of Astronomy &amp; Arithmetick, &amp; Letters were as ne<a id="l3303"></a>cessary to a Merchant, &amp; therefore its reasonable to ascribe <a id="l3304"></a>the invention of all these things to the Phenicians, or if you <a id="l3305"></a>please, to the inhabitants of the red sea who were the first mer<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p154r"> &lt;154r&gt; </span>chants.

About When Amphion &amp; Zethus were about 20 years <a id="l3323"></a>old, at the instigation of their mother Antiopa they killed <a id="l3324"></a>Lycus, made Laius the young sone of Labdacus fly to Pelops, <a id="l3325"></a> seized the city Thebes,  compassed it with a wall &amp; <a id="l3326"></a>from their kinswoman Thebe called it Thebes, &amp; then <a id="l3327"></a>Amphion married Niobe the sister of Pelops &amp; by her had <a id="l3328"></a>several children amongst whom was Chloris the mother of <a id="l3329"></a>Periclymenus who was one of the Argonauts. Whence I <a id="l3330"></a>gather that Amphion killed Lycus and married  Niobe <a id="l3331"></a>about two generations before the Argonautic expedition <a id="l3332"></a>&amp; as much after the coming of Cadmus into Europe <a id="l3333"></a>that is about the 25<sup>t</sup> year of Solomon &amp; that <a id="l3334"></a>Amphion &amp; Zethus were born &amp; Epopeus &amp; Nicteus <a id="l3335"></a>slain about 20 years before &amp; that Pelops was of about <a id="l3336"></a>the same age with Amphion &amp; Zethus.

He married Iocasta the sister of Creon <a id="l3340"></a>&amp; by her had Oedipus who ignorantly slew his father &amp; <a id="l3341"></a>married his mother.

Whence I gather <a id="l3344"></a>that Oedipus was about 20 or 25 years older then Her<a id="l3345"></a>cules, &amp; his sons Eteocles &amp; Polynices whom he had by <a id="l3346"></a>a former wife named Eurygenea, were of about the same <a id="l3347"></a>age with Hercules. Polynices the younger brother in the <a id="l3348"></a>reign of his father Oedipus fled to Argos &amp; there married <a id="l3349"></a>the daughter of Adrastus king of Argos &amp; upon the death <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p155r"> &lt;155r&gt; </span> of Oedipus returned to Thebes. But falling out with <a id="l3350"></a>Eteocles about the kingdom returned back to Adrastus. <a id="l3351"></a>And thence ensued the war of the seven captains against <a id="l3352"></a>Thebes in which Eteocles &amp; Polynices slew one another <a id="l3353"></a>Laodamas the son of Eteocles succeeded his father at <a id="l3354"></a>Thebes, &amp; during his minority Creon administered the king<a id="l3355"></a>dom. When Laodamas was grown up there ensued ano<a id="l3356"></a>ther war between him &amp; Thersander the son of Poly<a id="l3357"></a>nices.

<p id="par155">After Lamedon had reigned some years at Ægyale <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n236-ref">[236]</sup> he made <a id="l3361"></a>war upon Archander &amp; Architeles the sons of Achæus the <a id="l3362"></a>grandson of Erechtheus &amp; in that war was assisted by Sicyon <a id="l3363"></a>the son of Metion the son of Erechtheus &amp; dying left his <a id="l3364"></a>kingdom to Sicyon,  from whome the city Ægyale was called <a id="l3365"></a>Sicyon &amp; the kingdom Sicyonia.  And Sicyon was succeeded by his grandson Poly<a id="l3368"></a>bus who was contemporary to Adrastus king of Argos &amp; by con<a id="l3369"></a>sequence to the Argonautic expedition &amp; war of the seven <a id="l3370"></a>captains. The kings of Sicyon were therefore<sup class="note" id="n237-ref">[237]</sup> Ægyalus, <a id="l3371"></a>Europs, Telchin, Apis or , Epaphus or Epopeus Lamedon, Sicyon, Polybus <a id="l3372"></a>&amp;c. Between Apis &amp; Epaphus or Epopeus Chronologers reccon many <a id="l3373"></a>other kings, for whom there is no room. None of those <a id="l3374"></a>kings gave their name to any cities regions or people <a id="l3375"></a>as was the custome in those days. None of them had wars <a id="l3376"></a>with any nation. Epopeus<sup class="note" id="n238-ref">[238]</sup> was the first king of Ægyale <a id="l3377"></a>who made war; &amp; without war kingdoms do not use to <a id="l3378"></a>continue long. Apis is recconed by some<sup class="note" id="n239-ref">[239]</sup>  the son or grand<a id="l3379"></a>son of Phoroneus, &amp; by others the grandson of Ægyaleus <a id="l3380"></a>the brother of Phoroneus, &amp; therefore since Phoroneus <a id="l3381"></a>was contemporary to David, Apis must be contemporary to <a id="l3382"></a>Solomon or Rehoboam &amp; so could not reign before Epopeus. <a id="l3383"></a> Herodotus tells us<sup class="note" id="n240-ref">[240]</sup>  that Apis in the Greek tongue is Epaphus &amp; we shewed above that Epaphus &amp; Epopeus are the same king. The Greeks feign that this king went into Egypt &amp; there became the great <a id="l3385"></a>god whom the Egyptians call Apis Epaphus Serapis &amp; Osiris. <a id="l3386"></a>&amp; that Ceres was the goddess Isis. And hence I learn that <a id="l3387"></a>in the opinion of the ancient Greeks Osiris &amp; Isis reigned in <a id="l3388"></a>Egypt when Apis &amp; Ceres flourished in Greece or presently <a id="l3389"></a>after, that is, in the days of Solomon or Rehoboam.</p>
<p id="par156">Between Phoroneus &amp; Acrisius Chronologers reccon up many <a id="l3390"></a>kings of Argos, namely Apis, Argus, , Pirasus or Phorbas, Triopas, Iasus <a id="l3391"></a>Crotopus, , Sthenelus, Danaus, Lynceus &amp;c. And yet for <a id="l3392"></a>so many intermediate successive kings there is no room. Its more probable that they were kings of several cities which afterwards united under Argos. For Some of them <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p156r"> &lt;156r&gt; </span> were contemporary to Inachus &amp; Phoroneus &amp; others were later <a id="l3393"></a>then Aerisus. ffor Polycaon the younger son of Lelex <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n241-ref">[241]</sup>  married <a id="l3394"></a>Messene the daughter of Tropas the son of Phorbas.  &amp; therefore Phorbos was as old as Lelex &amp; by consequence older than then Inachus. He led a Io the daughter of Inachus is <a id="l3396"></a>sometimes called the daughter of Iasus, which makes it suspected <a id="l3397"></a>that Iasus is corruptly written for Inachus. Danaus &amp; his son <a id="l3398"></a>Lynceus &amp; daughters were younger then Perseus the grandson of Aerisius <a id="l3399"></a> &amp; older then the Argonauts as has been <a id="l3402"></a>shewed above &amp; therefore flourished in the reign of Rehoboam, &amp; in the same age flourished Ægyptus the bro<a id="l3404"></a>ther of Danaus whom Manetho calls Sethosis.</p>
<p id="par157">And since the Greeks in the room of the Egypti<a id="l3405"></a>an Bacchus substituted the son of Semele it argues <a id="l3406"></a>that the Egyptian Bacchus in the opinion of the anci<a id="l3407"></a>ent Greeks was contemporary to the son of Semele &amp; <a id="l3408"></a>by consequence to Solomon &amp; Rehoboam. He was <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n242-ref">[242]</sup>  con<a id="l3409"></a>temporary to Perseus &amp; Perseus flourished in the reign <a id="l3410"></a>of those two kings.</p>
<p id="par158">So then these three kings of Egypt Osiris, Bacchus, <a id="l3411"></a>&amp; Sethosis lived in one &amp; the same age, &amp; being all <a id="l3412"></a>of them very great conquerors, its probable that they <a id="l3413"></a>were but several names of one &amp; the same king.</p>
<p id="par159">Conon in his 37<sup>th</sup> Narration tells us that when <a id="l3414"></a>Cadmus was sent by the king of the Phenicians to <a id="l3415"></a>seek Europa,  the Phenicians were very potent &amp; <a id="l3416"></a>having conquered a great part of Asia placed their <a id="l3417"></a>royal seat at the Egyptian Thebes. It seems the <a id="l3418"></a>Phenicians gloried in their descent from Egypt, &amp; being conquered by the Egyptians &amp; become the subjects of Egypt they <a id="l3419"></a>affected to be accounted Egyptians, &amp; for that end derived <a id="l3420"></a>their great men from the royal  family reigning <a id="l3421"></a>at Thebes. For they ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 155v &gt; </span> ✝ accounted Belus to be a Phenician.

Belus <a id="l3426"></a>in the language of the Egyptians &amp; Libyans is Ammon <a id="l3427"></a>or as the Greeks &amp; Latines call him, Iupiter Ammon <a id="l3428"></a>&amp; his wife <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n244-ref">[244]</sup>  Iuno Ammonia. And therefore Ammon <a id="l3429"></a>was the father of Ægyptus, Danaus,  Cepheus &amp; Phineus and <a id="l3430"></a>brother of Agenor according to the Phenicians, so that <a id="l3431"></a>in his reign happened the story of Agenor &amp; Cadmus <a id="l3432"></a>&amp; in the next reign the storys of Ægyptus, Danaus, Cepheus <a id="l3433"></a>&amp; Phineus. Now Cepheus &amp; his daughter Andromeda were <a id="l3434"></a>contemporary to Perseus &amp; therefore flourished in the reign <a id="l3435"></a>of Solomon.

For Conon in <a id="l3438"></a>his 40<sup>th</sup> Narration saith that Cepheus the father of <a id="l3439"></a>Andromeda reigned from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea <a id="l3440"></a>&amp; that his kingdom was called Ioppa from the city Ioppa <a id="l3441"></a>upon the Mediterranean. And Stephanus in Ιόπη tells us <a id="l3442"></a>that this city was built by Cepheus. And Solinus c. 47 <a id="l3443"></a>that they there shewed the rock to which Andromeda <a id="l3444"></a>was chained.</p>
<p id="par166">Manetho tells us<sup class="note" id="n245-ref">[245]</sup>  that Ægyptus &amp; Danaus were <a id="l3445"></a>Sethosis &amp; Armais &amp; that Sethosis having forces by <a id="l3446"></a>sea &amp; land left the government of Æygpt to his <a id="l3447"></a>brother Armais while he invaded &amp; conquered Cyprus <a id="l3448"></a>Phœnicia, Media, Persia &amp; other nations. Others ascribe <a id="l3449"></a>these  conquests to Sesostris: for Sethosis &amp; Sesostris are but two <a id="l3450"></a>names of the same king. The Greeks have transmitted to <a id="l3451"></a>posterity many things concerning Sesostris all which had been <a id="l3452"></a>forgotten had those things been done before the use of letters <a id="l3453"></a>brought into Europe by Cadmus. And therefore Sesostris reigned <a id="l3454"></a>after the rapture of Europa &amp; by consequence after the <a id="l3455"></a>days of Saul David &amp; Solomon. For Herodotus saw some of <a id="l3456"></a>Sesostris his  pillars erected in Palestine in memory of <a id="l3457"></a>his conquering that country, &amp; such a conquest cannot agree <a id="l3458"></a>either to the warlike &amp; victorious reigns of Saul &amp; David <a id="l3459"></a>or to the peaceable &amp; flourishing reign of Solomon; nor is there <a id="l3460"></a>any mention of an invasion of Iudea by the Egyptians in the <a id="l3461"></a>days of the Iudges or at any time before the fift year of <a id="l3462"></a>Rehoboam. And on the other hand all antiquity reccon <a id="l3463"></a>Sesostris older then the Trojan war &amp; something older then <a id="l3464"></a>the Argonautic expedition. The ship Argo was the first long ship built by the Greeks &amp; the Greeks built  <a id="l3465"></a>it after the pattern of the long ship in which Danaus upon the <a id="l3466"></a>return of Ægyptus or Sethosis into Egypt, sailed with his <a id="l3467"></a>fifty daughters to Greece,<sup class="note" id="n246-ref">[246]</sup>  &amp; Argus the son of Danaus was <a id="l3468"></a>the master builder. Sethosis therefore returned into Egypt <a id="l3469"></a>before the Argonautic expedition &amp; not above one generati<a id="l3470"></a>on before, &amp; by consequence invaded the nations in the reign <a id="l3471"></a>of Rehoboam, &amp; so can be no other king then Sesak.</p>
<p id="par167">The same thing is confirmed by Iosephus<sup class="note" id="n247-ref">[247]</sup>  who affirms <a id="l3472"></a>that Herodotus ascribes to Sesostris the actions of Sesak, mentioning his expedition against Ierusalem &amp; conquest of Palestine &amp; other nations &amp; erring <a id="l3473"></a>only in the name of the king. Which is all one as to say that <a id="l3474"></a>Sesak was that conquerer whom Herodotus calls Sesostris. <a id="l3475"></a>The old Scholiast of Apollonius Rhodius<sup class="note" id="n248-ref">[248]</sup>  out of Dicæarchus calls him Sesonchosis <a id="l3476"></a>saying that Sesonchosis who was king of all Egypt &amp; reigned <a id="l3477"></a>after Orus the son of Osiris &amp; Isis, conquered all Asia <a id="l3478"></a>&amp; a great part of Europe &amp; erected pillars of his conquests, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p158r"> &lt;158r&gt; </span> and made laws &amp; found out horsmanship &amp; left a colony at <a id="l3479"></a>Æa with laws writ in Tables &amp; with Geographical Tables <a id="l3480"></a>of his conquests by land &amp; sea &amp; that Theopompus calls him <a id="l3481"></a>Sesostris. Now Sesonchosis or as others call him Sesonchis is the <a id="l3482"></a>same name with Sesak much after the manner that Mem<a id="l3483"></a>phis is the same name with Moph, or that the Susanchites <a id="l3484"></a>(Ezra 4) are the people of Susa or Shushan called <a id="l3485"></a>Sheshach by Ieremiah chap. 25 &amp;51.</p>
<p id="par168">Ægypt was conquered successively by the Ethiopians, <a id="l3486"></a>Assyrians, Babylonians &amp; Persians &amp; by those conquests their <a id="l3487"></a>antiquities  &amp; Records were  from time to time <a id="l3488"></a>impaired &amp; at length destroyed &amp; carried away upon the con<a id="l3489"></a>quest of Egypt by Artaxerxes Ochus king of Persia, &amp; <a id="l3490"></a>from that time the Greeks left off travelling into Egypt <a id="l3491"></a>for knowledge.  Manetho &amp; Eratosthe<a id="l3492"></a>nes  wrote long after that conquest which makes their <a id="l3493"></a>accounts of the kings of Egypt very confused. Herodotus <a id="l3494"></a>travelled into Egypt almost an hundred years before that <a id="l3495"></a>conquest &amp; in giving an account of the ancient state of <a id="l3496"></a>Egypt he tells us<sup class="note" id="n249-ref">[249]</sup>  that the Priests of Egypt affirming <a id="l3497"></a>Menes to be their first king, read to him out of a <a id="l3498"></a>book the names of 330 following kings of Egypt who <a id="l3499"></a>all reigned before Sesostris &amp; among whom were eighteen <a id="l3500"></a>Ethiopians &amp; a forreign woman named Nitocris who <a id="l3501"></a>aquired the kingdom by a memorable revenge of her <a id="l3502"></a>brothers death, &amp; that the Priests affirmed nothing done <a id="l3503"></a>by any of the rest except one who was the last of <a id="l3504"></a>them &amp; was called Mœris. But Menes &amp; Mœris reigned <a id="l3505"></a>at Memphis &amp; together with some other kings of Memphjs built there the most magnificent Temple of Vulcan. <a id="l3506"></a>&amp; therefore were later then Sesostris as we shall further shew <a id="l3507"></a>hereafter, &amp; so was Nitocris later if she reigned over <a id="l3508"></a>both Egypt &amp; Ethiopia as Iosephus mentions, &amp; built <a id="l3509"></a>the third Pyramid at Memphis as is affirmed by Ma<a id="l3510"></a>netho. Herodotus therefore justly passes over in a few <a id="l3511"></a>words all the ages of Egypt before Sesostris as obscure <a id="l3512"></a>&amp; containing nothing memorable &amp; begins his history <a id="l3513"></a>of the kings of Egypt with this king, the former <a id="l3514"></a>kings, except two or three of his immediate prede<a id="l3515"></a>cessors, reigning not over all Egypt successively but <a id="l3516"></a>divers of them at once in several parts of Egypt, which <a id="l3517"></a>renders them the less memorable. In the <a id="l3518"></a>time of the Monarchy of Egypt, Herodotus who has given us the best <a id="l3519"></a>account of this kingdom, sets down their kings in the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p159r"> &lt;159r&gt; </span> following order if Menes Mœris &amp; Nitocris be duly in<a id="l3520"></a>serted.
