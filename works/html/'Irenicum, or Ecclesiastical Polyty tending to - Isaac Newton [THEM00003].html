<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Irenicum.</h2>
<p id="par1">In matters of religion the first &amp; great Commandment hath <a id="l1"></a>always been: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all  thy heart <a id="l2"></a>&amp; with all thy soul &amp; with all thy mind. And the second is like unto <a id="l3"></a>it: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self. On these two hang <a id="l4"></a>all the Law &amp; the Prophets. Matth. 22.27. And the Gospel is that Iesus <a id="l5"></a>is the Christ. Whoever beleiveth that Iesus is the Christ is born of God, &amp; every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him 1 Iohn 5.1.</p>
<p id="par2">When Christ rose from the dead he appeared to his disciples to prove <a id="l6"></a>to them his resurrection, &amp; expounded to them out of Moses &amp; all the <a id="l7"></a>Prophets &amp; the Psalms the things concerning himself, viz<sup>t</sup> how that the <a id="l8"></a>Christ ought to suffer &amp; to rise from the dead the third day &amp; to enter <a id="l9"></a>into his glory, &amp; that he was the Christ in whom all those things were <a id="l10"></a>fulfilled, &amp; that repentance &amp; remission of sins should be preached in <a id="l11"></a>his name amongst all nations beginning at Ierusalem. (Luke 24.21, 22, <a id="l12"></a>23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 44, 45, 46, 47.) He told them also that all power was <a id="l13"></a>given him in heaven &amp; in earth &amp; that he would send the promise of <a id="l14"></a>his father upon them (viz<sup>t</sup> the Holy Ghost) whereby they should be <a id="l15"></a>endued with power from on high &amp; that they should then go &amp; teach <a id="l16"></a>all nations what he had taught them &amp; baptize them in the name of <a id="l17"></a>the father &amp; of the Son and of the Holy Ghost &amp; that he would be with <a id="l18"></a>them &amp; their disciples &amp; the disciples of their disciples always unto <a id="l19"></a>the end of the world Matt. 28.18, 19, 20. Luke 24.49, 50. And after <a id="l20"></a>these things he ascended up into heaven in their sight, &amp; they were <a id="l21"></a>told by an Angel that he should come again in the same manner as <a id="l22"></a>they saw him ascend. And all this is the Gospel which Christ sent his <a id="l23"></a>disciples to teach all nations &amp; which the first Christians were taught <a id="l24"></a>in catechising before baptism &amp; communion, </p>
<p id="par3">Repentance &amp; remission of sins relate to  transgressions <a id="l25"></a>against the two first commandments. We are to forsake the Devil, <a id="l26"></a>that is, all fals Gods &amp; all manner of idolatry, this being a breach of the first <a id="l27"></a>&amp; great commandment. And we are to forsake the flesh &amp; the world, or <a id="l28"></a>as the Apostle Iohn expresseth it, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the <a id="l29"></a>eye, &amp; the pride of life, that is, unchastity, covetousness pride &amp; ambition; these <a id="l30"></a><a id="l31"></a>things being a breach of the second of the two great commandments. <a id="l32"></a>And we are to beleive in one God, the father, almighty in dominion, the <a id="l33"></a>maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp; of all things therein; &amp; in one Lord Iesus <a id="l34"></a>Christ the son of God, who was born of a Virgn, &amp; sacrificed for us on the <a id="l35"></a>cross, &amp; the third day rose again from the dead, &amp; ascended into heaven, &amp; <a id="l36"></a>sitteth on the right hand of God in a mystical sense, being next unto him <a id="l37"></a>in honour &amp; power, &amp;  who shall come again to judge the quick &amp; the dead raised <a id="l38"></a>again to life, &amp; who sent the Holy Ghost to comfort his disciples &amp; assist <a id="l39"></a>them in preaching the Gospel. All this was taught from the beginning <a id="l40"></a>of the Gospel in Catechising, that the Catechumen might know before Baptism <a id="l41"></a>why &amp; in whose names he was to be washed. viz<sup>t</sup> in the name of one God the father &amp; of one Lord Iesus Christ &amp;c. And nothing more is now <a id="l42"></a>necessary to communion &amp; salvation then what was taught in those days before <a id="l43"></a>baptism &amp; admission into communion . ffor every thing necessary to communion must be taught before admission into it.</p>
<p id="par4">All this the Apostle Paul calls milk for babes &amp; the foundation &amp; first <a id="l44"></a>Principles of the doctrine of Christ.  And those things which are to be <a id="l45"></a>learnt after admission into communion he calls strong meat for men of <a id="l46"></a>riper years. For in writing to the Hebrews he saith: <em class="underline">When for the time <a id="l47"></a>ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the <a id="l48"></a>first principles of the oracles of God; &amp; are become such as have need of milk <a id="l49"></a>&amp; not strong meat. For every one that useth milk, is unexercised in the <a id="l50"></a>word of  righteousness, for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to <a id="l51"></a>them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their <a id="l52"></a>senses exercised to discern both good &amp; evil. Therefore leaving the principles</em>  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p3"> &lt;3&gt; </span><em class="underline">of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection, not laying <a id="l53"></a>again the foundation of repentance from dead works, &amp; of  faith towards God</em>,  <em class="underline">Of the doctrine of Baptisms <a id="l55"></a>&amp; of</em> [admission into communion by] <em class="underline">laying on of hands</em> [in the name of the father Son &amp; Holy Ghost ] <em class="underline">&amp; of the resurrection of the dead &amp; of eternal judg<a id="l56"></a>ment</em>. Heb. V.12, 13, 14 &amp; VI.1, 2. Here the Apostle under the name of <a id="l57"></a>milk for babes comprehends all that was taught before baptism <a id="l58"></a>&amp; admission into communion, &amp; under the name of strong meats <a id="l59"></a>he comprehends all that was to be learnt afterwards by men of riper years in studying <a id="l60"></a>the scriptures or otherwise. And since strong meats are not fit for <a id="l61"></a>babes, but are to be given only to men of riper years they were not to be imposed on all men but only to be learnt <a id="l62"></a>by such as after admission into communion were able to learn them. <a id="l63"></a>And by consequence men were not to damn or excommunicate one <a id="l64"></a>another or treat one another as heretiques, or quarrel or reproach one another, or <a id="l65"></a> hate or despise or censure one another for not knowing them. <a id="l66"></a>Every man after admission into communion was to study the scriptures <a id="l67"></a>&amp; especially the Prophesies, &amp; to learn as much as he could out of <a id="l68"></a>them, &amp; might endeavour to instruct his neighbour in a friendly <a id="l69"></a>manner, but not fall out with him for differing in opinion about <a id="l70"></a>any thing which was not imposed before baptism &amp; admission into <a id="l71"></a>communion. For enmity &amp; discord in things not  necessary to com<a id="l72"></a>munion  tends to schism &amp; is contrary to the rule of charity imposed upon <a id="l73"></a>all men in the second of the two great commandments &amp; more especially upon those of the same communion. And with <a id="l74"></a>what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged. See Rom XIV &amp; XV, &amp; <a id="l75"></a>1 Cor. III. If any thing s<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>hould<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> at any time be made necessary to communion which was not so before, it ought thence forward to be taught before admission into communion.</p>
<p id="par5">And as for the Christian worship, we are authorized in <a id="l76"></a>scripture to give glory  &amp; honour to God the father because he hath created all things, &amp; to the Lamb of God because he <a id="l77"></a>hath redeemed us with his blood &amp; is our Lord, &amp; to direct our prayers <a id="l78"></a>to God the father in the name of Christ for what we want &amp; give <a id="l79"></a>him thanks for what we receive, &amp; to wish for Grace &amp; peace from <a id="l80"></a>God &amp; Christ &amp; the Holy Ghost &amp; baptize in their name, &amp; to re<a id="l81"></a>ceive the Eucharist in memory of Christs death. All this was <a id="l82"></a>practised by the first Christians in the Apostles days from the <a id="l83"></a>time of their admission into Communion, &amp; is included in the first <a id="l84"></a>principles of the doctrine of Christ, &amp; if any man contend for <a id="l85"></a>any other sort of worship which he cannot prove to have been <a id="l86"></a>practised in the Apostles days, he <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span> may use it in his Closet <a id="l87"></a>without troubling the Churches with his private sentiments.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; insertion from p 2 &gt; </span>
<p id="par6">The first Principles of the Christian religion are founded, not on <a id="l88"></a>disputable  conclusions or humane sanctions, opinions or conjectures, but on the express words of Christ &amp; his Apostles; <a id="l89"></a>&amp; we are to hold fast the form of sound words. It is not enough that <a id="l90"></a>a Proposition be true or in the express words of scripture: it must <a id="l91"></a>also appear to have been taught from the  days of the Apostles in order to <a id="l92"></a>baptism &amp; communion. For the  Laws of Communion are  unchangeable Dan. 7.25.. If an Angel from heaven preach any other Gospel [as <a id="l94"></a>necessary to Communion &amp; Salvation] then that which  the Apostles preached <a id="l95"></a> let him be accursed. Gal. 1.8, 9. And since Christ <a id="l96"></a>set on foot the Christian religion by</p>

<p id="par7">And since Christ set on foot the Christian religion by explaining <a id="l97"></a>to his Apostles the prophesies in Moses the Prophets &amp; the Psalms concerning him<a id="l98"></a>self, &amp; sending them to teach his interpretations to all nations: if <a id="l99"></a>any question at any time arise concerning his interpretations, we <a id="l100"></a>are to  to have recourse to the old Testament, &amp; <a id="l102"></a>compare the places interpreted with the interpretations thereof in the <a id="l103"></a>new. As for instance in  explaining why Iesus is called the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>  Christ or Messiah, the <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup>  Son of Man, the <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup>  Son of God, the <a id="l105"></a><sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup>  Lamb of God, the <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> Word of God, <span class="ns">☉</span> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from p 2 &gt; </span> <span class="ns">☉</span> the <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>  Lord who sitteth on the right hand of God,<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from p 3 resumes &gt; </span> &amp; the g<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup>  God who was in the beginning with <a id="l106"></a>God &amp; by whom all things were made And by this means the Old Testament will be also better understood.</p>

<p id="par8">All nations were originally of the Religion  compre<a id="l108"></a>hended in the Precepts of the sons of Noah, the chief of which were <a id="l109"></a>to have one God, &amp; not to alienate his worship, nor prophane his <a id="l110"></a>name; to abstein from murder, theft, fornication, &amp; all injuries; not <a id="l111"></a>to feed on the flesh or drink the blood of a living animal, but to be <a id="l112"></a>mercifull even to bruit beasts; &amp; to set up Courts of justice in <a id="l113"></a>all cities &amp; societies for putting these laws in execution. In the anci<a id="l114"></a>ent cities the Iudges usually sat in the Gates of the city &amp; were <a id="l115"></a>called the Elders of the city &amp; judged of causes both sacred &amp; civil &amp; the father of every family was the <a id="l116"></a>elder of the family subordinate to the Elders of the city. This <a id="l117"></a>religion descended to Melchisedec &amp; Iob &amp; to Abraham Isaac Iacob Moses &amp; the <a id="l118"></a>Israelites &amp; to the proselites of the Gate. ffor so the Israelites called the <a id="l119"></a>strangers within their Gates  who observed the precepts of the sons of Noah. But the <a id="l120"></a>Kings of the nations by degrees causing their dead ancestors to be <a id="l121"></a>celebrated with sacrifices praises &amp; invocations, the religion of Noah &amp; <a id="l122"></a>his sons passed  into the worship of dead men &amp; the laws of their courts of Iustice into the moral Philosophy of the <a id="l123"></a>heathens. . ffor Pythagoras one of the <a id="l124"></a>oldest Philosophers in Europe, after he had travelled  among the <a id="l125"></a>eastern nations for the sake of knowledge &amp; conversed with their Priests &amp; Iudges &amp; seen their manners,  <a id="l126"></a>taught his scholars that all men should be friends to all men &amp; even <a id="l127"></a>to bruit Beasts &amp; should conciliate the friendship of the Gods by piety, &amp; <a id="l128"></a>that a friend was another self, &amp; his disciples were celebrated for <a id="l129"></a>loving one another. The religion of Noah &amp; his sons was therefore <a id="l130"></a> the moral law of all nations put in execution by their <a id="l131"></a>courts of Iustice untill they corrupted themselves.</p>
<p id="par9">Then Moses reformed the Israelites from those corruptions &amp; added <a id="l132"></a>many new precepts to the Moral law, writing  all down in a book <a id="l133"></a>&amp; imposed the whole upon the people of Israel by the covenant of <a id="l134"></a>circumcision, &amp; allowed strangers  of all nations to live within <a id="l135"></a>their Gates  without entring into that covenant, provided <a id="l136"></a>they kept the Precepts of the sons of Noah. And for putting this law <a id="l137"></a>in execution he commanded that the people of Israel should make <a id="l138"></a> Iudges &amp; Officers in all their Gates.  Deut. 16.10. And these <a id="l139"></a>courts continued in Iudea till the Babylonian captivity &amp; then were <a id="l140"></a>abolished by the Chaldeans (Lament. 5.14) &amp; restored by the Commissi<a id="l141"></a>on of Artaxerxes given to Ezra (Ezra 7.25, 26 &amp; 10.14) &amp; in the reign <a id="l142"></a>of the Greeks were called the Sanhedrim &amp; Synagogues of the Iews. And <a id="l143"></a>because the Elders (called Presbyters by the Greeks) judged of things both <a id="l144"></a>sacred &amp; civil, they had a place of worship adjoyning to the Court where <a id="l145"></a>they sat, &amp; before the Babylonian captivity  they had sometimes upon the next high hill an altar for sacrificing &amp; a place for eating <a id="l147"></a>the sacrifices called the High Place.</p>
<p id="par10">When Christ was asked which was the great Commandment of <a id="l148"></a>the Law, he answered, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy <a id="l149"></a>heart &amp; with all thy soul &amp; with all thy mind. This is the first &amp; <a id="l150"></a>great commandment, &amp; the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy <a id="l151"></a>neighbour as thy self. On these two commandments hang all the <a id="l152"></a>Law &amp; the Prophets. Mat. 22.36. This was the religion of the sons of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p7"> &lt;7&gt; </span>Noah established by Moses &amp; Christ &amp; is still in force.</p>

<p id="par11">In matters of religion the first &amp; great Commandment <a id="l153"></a>hath always been: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with <a id="l154"></a>all thy heart, &amp; with all thy soul &amp; with all thy mind. <a id="l155"></a>And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neigh<a id="l156"></a>bour as thy self. On these two hang all the law &amp; the <a id="l157"></a>Prophets. Matth. 22.27. And the Gospel is, that Iesus is the <a id="l158"></a>Christ. Whoever beleiveth that Iesus is the Christ is born of <a id="l159"></a>God, &amp; every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also <a id="l160"></a>that is begotten of him. 1 Iohn. 5.1.</p>
<p id="par12">When Christ rose from the dead he appeared to his disciples <a id="l161"></a>to prove to them his resurrection, &amp; expounded to them out of <a id="l162"></a>Moses &amp; all the Prophets &amp; the Psalms, the things concerning himself <a id="l163"></a>viz<sup>t</sup> how that Christ ought to suffer &amp; to rise from the dead the third <a id="l164"></a>day, &amp; to enter into his glory, &amp; that he was the Christ in whom all <a id="l165"></a>those things were fulfilled, &amp; that repentance &amp; remission of sins <a id="l166"></a>should be preached in his name amongst all nations beginning at Ieru<a id="l167"></a>salem (Luke 24.21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 44, 45, 46, 47.) He told them also that <a id="l168"></a>all power was given him in heaven &amp; in earth &amp; that he would <a id="l169"></a>send the promise of his father upon them (viz<sup>t</sup> the Holy Ghost) <a id="l170"></a>whereby they should be endued with power from on high, &amp; that <a id="l171"></a>they should then go &amp; teach all nations what he had taught them, &amp; <a id="l172"></a>baptize them in  the name of the ffather &amp; of the Son <a id="l173"></a>&amp; of the Holy Ghost, &amp; that he would be with them &amp; their disci<a id="l174"></a>ples &amp; the disciples of their disciples always unto the end of the world <a id="l175"></a>(Matth. 28.18, 19, 20. Luke 24.49, 50.) And after these things he <a id="l176"></a>ascended up into heaven in their sight, &amp; they were told by an Angel <a id="l177"></a>that he should come again in the same manner that they saw <a id="l178"></a>him ascend. And all this is the Gospel which Christ sent his disciples <a id="l179"></a>to teach all nations, &amp; which the first Christians were taught in <a id="l180"></a>catechising before baptism &amp; communion.</p>
<p id="par13">Repentance &amp; remission of sins relate to transgressions <a id="l181"></a>against the two  great commandments. We are to forsake the <a id="l182"></a><em class="underline">Devil</em>, that is all fals Gods &amp; all manner of idolatry this being <a id="l183"></a>a breach of the first &amp; great commandment. And we are to <a id="l184"></a>forsake the <em class="underline">flesh</em> &amp; the <em class="underline">World</em>, or as the Apostle Iohn expresseth <a id="l185"></a>it, the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye &amp; the pride of life, <a id="l186"></a>that is, unchastity, intemperance, injustice, covetousness, pride, &amp; ambition, these things being <a id="l187"></a>a breach of the second of the two great commandments. And we are <a id="l188"></a>(with the primitive Greek Church) to beleive in one God, the ffather, <a id="l189"></a>almighty in dominion, the maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp; of all things <a id="l190"></a>therein: and in one Lord Iesus Christ, the son of God, who was <a id="l191"></a>born of a Virgin, &amp; sacrificed for us on the cross, &amp; the third day <a id="l192"></a>rose again from the dead, &amp; ascended into heaven, &amp; sitteth on <a id="l193"></a>the right hand of God in a mystical sense, being next to him in <a id="l194"></a>  honour &amp; power; &amp; who shall come again to judge &amp; reign over the <a id="l195"></a>quick &amp; the dead raised again to life; &amp; who sent the Holy Ghost <a id="l196"></a>to comfort his disciples &amp; assist them in preaching the Gospel. All <a id="l197"></a>this was taught from the beginning of the Gospel in catechising, that the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p11"> &lt;11&gt; </span>Catechumen might know before baptism why &amp; in whose names he <a id="l198"></a>was to be washed, viz<sup>t</sup> in the name of one God the father &amp; of one <a id="l199"></a>Lord Iesus Christ &amp;c 1 Cor. 8.6.. And nothing more is now necessary to communion <a id="l200"></a>&amp; salvation then what was taught in those days before baptism &amp; com<a id="l201"></a>munion, &amp; in order thereunto. For every thing necessary to communion <a id="l202"></a>must be taught before admission into it.</p>
<p id="par14">All this the Apostle Paul calls milk for babes &amp; the foundation &amp; <a id="l203"></a>first Principles of the doctrine of Christ. And those things which are to <a id="l204"></a>be learnt after admission into communion he calls strong meats for <a id="l205"></a>men of riper years. For in writing to the Hebrews he saith: <em class="underline">When <a id="l206"></a>for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach <a id="l207"></a>you again what be the first principles of the oracles of God &amp; <a id="l208"></a>are become such as have need of milk &amp; not strong meat. <a id="l209"></a>For every one that useth milk is unexercised in the word of <a id="l210"></a>righteousness, for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth <a id="l211"></a>to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of <a id="l212"></a>use have their senses exercised to discern both good &amp; evil. <a id="l213"></a>Therefore leaving the Principles of the doctrine of Christ <a id="l214"></a>let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation <a id="l215"></a>of repentance from dead works &amp; of faith towards God; Of the <a id="l216"></a>doctrine of Baptisms &amp; of</em> [admission into Communion by] <em class="underline">laying <a id="l217"></a>on of hands, &amp; of the resurrection of the dead &amp; of eternal <a id="l218"></a>judgment</em>. Heb. V.12, 13, 14 &amp; VI.1, 2. Here the Apostle under the <a id="l219"></a>name of Milk for Babes comprehends all that was taught before <a id="l220"></a>Baptism &amp; admission into Communion, viz<sup>t</sup> repentance from the dead <a id="l221"></a>works of the world the flesh &amp; the Devil, &amp; the Creed or system <a id="l222"></a>of faith here called ffaith towards God &amp; the doctrine of bap<a id="l223"></a>tism &amp; confirmation founded upon it, including the resurrection &amp; <a id="l224"></a>last judgment. And under the name of strong meats he com<a id="l225"></a>prehends all that was to be learnt afterwards by men of riper <a id="l226"></a>years in studying the scriptures or otherwise. And since strong <a id="l227"></a>meats are not fit for babes but are to be given only to men of riper <a id="l228"></a>years, they are not to be imposed upon all men as necessary to com<a id="l229"></a>munion, but only to be learnt by such as after admission into com<a id="l230"></a>munion are able to learn them. And by consequence Christians  are not to damn or excommunicate one <a id="l232"></a>another or treat one another as heretiques, or quarrel or reproach <a id="l233"></a>one another or hate or despise or censure one another for not <a id="l234"></a>knowing them. Every man after chatechizing &amp; admission into com<a id="l235"></a>munion, is to study the scriptures &amp; especially the prophesies, &amp; to learn <a id="l236"></a>as much as he can out of them, &amp; may endeavour to instruct his <a id="l237"></a>neighbour in a friendly manner, but not fall out with him for differ<a id="l238"></a>ing in opinion about any thing which was not required before bap<a id="l239"></a>tism into the remission of sins, &amp; admission into the communion of <a id="l240"></a>Christians. Men may be excommunicated for breaking the condi<a id="l241"></a>tions upon which they were admitted into communion, but not for <a id="l242"></a>any thing else: &amp; men of the same communion are to love one <a id="l243"></a>another. Enmity &amp; discord in things not necessary to communion <a id="l244"></a>tends to schism &amp; is contrary to the  rule of charity imposed upon <a id="l245"></a>all men in the second of the two great Commandments, &amp; more <a id="l246"></a>especially upon those of the same communion. The strong in the <a id="l247"></a>faith must not despise the weak, &amp; the weak must not judge the strong. ffor with what <a id="l248"></a>judgement they judge they shall be judged. See Rom. XIV &amp; XV, &amp; 1 Cor. III.</p>
 <span class="pagenumber" id="p13"> &lt;13&gt; </span>
<p id="par15">And as for the Christian worship, we are authorized in <a id="l249"></a>scripture to give glory &amp; honour to God the father because he <a id="l250"></a>hath created all things, &amp; to the Lamb of God because he hath <a id="l251"></a>redeemed us with his blood &amp; is our Lord, &amp; to direct our prayers <a id="l252"></a>to God the father in the name of Christ for what we want, &amp; to <a id="l253"></a>give him thanks for what we receive, &amp; to wish for grace &amp; <a id="l254"></a>peace from God &amp; Christ &amp; the Holy Ghost, &amp; baptize in their <a id="l255"></a>name, &amp; to receive the Eucharist in memory of Christ's death. <a id="l256"></a>All this was practised by the first Christians in the Apostles <a id="l257"></a>days from the time of their admission into communion, &amp; is <a id="l258"></a>included in the first principles of the doctrine of Christ. And <a id="l259"></a>if any man contend for any other sort of worship which he <a id="l260"></a>cannot prove to have been practised in the Apostles days, he <a id="l261"></a>may use it in his Closet without troubling the Churches  <a id="l262"></a>with his private sentiments.</p>
<p id="par16">The first Principles of the Christian religion are <a id="l263"></a>founded, not on disputable conclusions opinions or conjectures or <a id="l264"></a>on humane sanctions, but on the express words of Christ &amp; his <a id="l265"></a>Apostles; &amp; we are to hold fast the form of sound words. 2 Tim. 1.13 <a id="l266"></a>And further, it is not enough that a Proposition be true or in <a id="l267"></a>the express words of Scripture: it must also appear to have <a id="l268"></a>been taught in the  days of the Apostles in order <a id="l269"></a>to baptism &amp; communion. ffor baptism into the remission of sins <a id="l270"></a>is of divine institution, &amp; the laws of God are unalterable by men. It <a id="l271"></a>is the character of his people that they keep his commandments <a id="l272"></a>(1 Iohn 2.3, 4 &amp; 5.2, 3 &amp; Apoc. 12.17) &amp; that of their enemies that they <a id="l273"></a>change times &amp; laws (Dan. 7.25.) Temporall laws may be made by <a id="l274"></a>men about the changeable circumstances of religion, &amp; temporal <a id="l275"></a>Iudges may be appointed to put the laws of both God &amp; the King in <a id="l276"></a>execution (Ezra 7.25, 26.) But the Gospel which Christ sent <a id="l277"></a>his Apostles to preach is not alterable by humane authority. <a id="l278"></a>It is as much the law of God as the Law of Moses was, &amp; as <a id="l279"></a>unalterable. The High Priest &amp; the Sanhedrim it self had no power to alter the <a id="l280"></a>law of Moses, &amp; if an Angel from heaven preach any other Gos<a id="l281"></a>pel then that which the Apostles preached [imposing it as a law <a id="l282"></a>of God necessary to baptism communion &amp; salvation] let him be <a id="l283"></a>accursed Gal. 1.8, 9.</p>
<p id="par17">And since Christ set on foot the Christian religion by explaining <a id="l284"></a>to his Apostles the prophesies in Moses the Prophets &amp; the Psalms concern<a id="l285"></a>ing himself, &amp; sending them to teach his interpretations to all nations: if <a id="l286"></a>any question at any time arise concerning his interpretations, we are to <a id="l287"></a>have recourse to the old Testament &amp; compare the places interpreted <a id="l288"></a>with the interpretations thereof in the new. As for instance, in explain<a id="l289"></a>ing why Iesus is called the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup>  Christ or Messiah, the <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup>  son of man, the <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup>  son <a id="l290"></a>of God, the <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup>  Lamb of God, the <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup>  Word of God, the <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup>  Lord who sitteth on the <a id="l291"></a>right hand of God, &amp; <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup>  the God who was in the beginning with God, &amp; by whom <a id="l292"></a>all things were made  or who was in glory with the father before the world began. &amp; came down from heaven.. And by this means the Old Testament will be also <a id="l293"></a>better understood.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p14"> &lt;14&gt; </span>
<p id="par18">And as the prophesies of the old Testament remained in obscu<a id="l294"></a>rity till Christs first coming &amp; then were interpreted by Christ &amp; <a id="l295"></a>the interpretations became the religion of the Christians: so the <a id="l296"></a>prophesies of both Testaments relating to Christs second coming <a id="l297"></a>may remain in obscurity till that coming, &amp; then be interpreted <a id="l298"></a>by divine authority, &amp; the interpretations become the religion of <a id="l299"></a>God's people till Christ has put all things under his feet in heaven &amp; earth &amp; shall deliver up the kingdom to the father. <a id="l300"></a>And therefore it is no objection against the Christian religion that the prophesies which relate to Christs second <a id="l301"></a>coming  remain still in obscurity.</p>
<p id="par19">3. The Apostle Paul opposed the  preaching of the law of Moses to the <a id="l302"></a>Gentiles,  &amp; called it another Gospel whereby <a id="l303"></a>the faith in Christ was made void, not because the Law was evil, (for the <a id="l304"></a>Apostle tells us that the Law is good;) but because it was not necessary <a id="l305"></a>to salvation &amp; therefore not to be imposed  as a fundamental  Article of communi<a id="l306"></a>on. And for the same reason the imposing of any Proposition (true or <a id="l307"></a>false) as an Article of Communion which was not an Article of Commu<a id="l308"></a>nion from the first preaching of the Gospel,  may be  preaching another <a id="l309"></a>Gospel, &amp; the persecuting of any true Christians for not receiving that <a id="l310"></a>Gospel  may be persecuting Christ in his mystical members, &amp; the Persecutor <a id="l311"></a>in making war upon Christ  breaks the second &amp; third great commandments &amp; may deserve the name of an Antichristian in <a id="l312"></a>a literal sense. A Church guilty of this crime is in a state of Apostasy from Christ <a id="l313"></a>.</p>

<p id="par21">2 Idolatry is a breach of the first &amp; greatest commandment. It is <a id="l317"></a>giving to Idols the love honour &amp; worship which is due to the true God alone. <a id="l318"></a>It is forsaking the true God to commit whoredome with other lovers. <a id="l319"></a>It makes a Church guilty of Apostasy from God as an Adulteress forsakes her husband.. It makes her guilty of <a id="l320"></a>spiritual whoredome with other lovers. It makes her become the Church <a id="l321"></a>of the Idols, fals Gods, or Dæmons whom she worships, such a true Church <a id="l322"></a>as in Scripture is called a Synagogue of Satan.</p>

<p id="par66">The government by Courts of Elders continued in Iudea till <a id="l602"></a>the Babylonian captivty &amp; then was abolished by the Chaldeans <a id="l603"></a>(Lament. 5.14) &amp;  restored by the Commission of Artaxer<a id="l604"></a>xes given to Ezra (Ezra 7.25, 26 &amp; 10.14) &amp; []  at that time Nehemi<a id="l606"></a>ah founding a Library gathered together the  Acts of the Kings &amp; the <a id="l607"></a>Prophets &amp; of David &amp; the Epistles of  the Kings concern<a id="l608"></a>ing the holy gifts. [2 Maccab. 2.13  &amp; out of these  Records  Ezra being a ready Scribe copied the Books of Samuel Kings <a id="l610"></a>&amp; Chronicles,  in due order of  time. ffor the Books of the Kings &amp; Chronicles cite one another &amp; therefore were written at one &amp; the same time &amp; the book  of Ezra was originally a part of the book of Chronicles,  this now ending abruptly with the words with which the other begins. And the Psalms &amp; Prophets <a id="l616"></a>he reduced also into  order. And in the reign of Antiochus Epipha<a id="l617"></a>nes  Iudas gathered together those things that were lost by <a id="l618"></a>  reason of the war &amp; left them in the order now extant. 2 Macc. 2.14.] &amp; the Book of Chroni<a id="l619"></a>cles cites also the Book of Samuel the Seer,  the Book of Nathan the Pro<a id="l620"></a>phet,  the book of Gad the Seer,  the  Prophesy of Ahijah the Shilonite,  the <a id="l621"></a>Book of Shemajah the Prophet,  the  history of Iddo the Seer, the book <a id="l622"></a>of Iehu the son of Hanani, &amp;  the Prophesies of Isaiah, &amp; therefore <a id="l623"></a>was copied out of these books &amp; perhaps some others.</p>
<p id="par67" class="i0">&amp; out of these  records Ezra being a ready scribe copied the Books of <a id="l624"></a>Samuel Kings &amp;  Chronicles puting the  extracts together in <a id="l625"></a>due order of time. ffor the Book of Chronicles cites the book of Samuel <a id="l626"></a>the Seer &amp; the book of Kings, &amp; the book of Nathan the Prophet &amp; the book of Gad <a id="l627"></a>the Seer, &amp; the Prophesy of Ahijah the Shilonite &amp; the book of She<a id="l628"></a>majah the Prophet &amp; the Book history of Iddo the Seer &amp; the book of <a id="l629"></a>Iehu the son of Hanani &amp; the prophesies of Isaiah &amp; therefore was <a id="l630"></a>extracted out of all these books. And the Book of  Kings mutually <a id="l631"></a>cites the books of the Chronicles, &amp; therefore both these books were written <a id="l632"></a>at one &amp; the same time. And the history  in both these books is <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p29"> &lt;29&gt; </span>continued down to the Babylonian captivity  <a id="l634"></a>&amp; therefore they were written in that captivity. And the book of Ezra was <a id="l635"></a>originally a part of the book of Chronicles &amp; therefore they were <a id="l636"></a>written by Ezra. ffor the book of Chronicles now breaks off <a id="l637"></a>abruptly, &amp; the book of Ezra begins with the  two last verses <a id="l638"></a>of the book of Chronicles &amp; carries on the history. And the first <a id="l639"></a>book of Ezdras begins with the two last chapters of the book of <a id="l640"></a>Chronicles &amp; carries on the history. ffor in the persecution of <a id="l641"></a>Antiochus Epiphanes the holy books were scattered, &amp; then Iudas <a id="l642"></a>Maccabæus gathered together those things that were lost by reason <a id="l643"></a>of the war 2 Macc. 2.14 And at that time the book of Ezra <a id="l644"></a>being broke of from the end of the book of Chronicles, was re<a id="l645"></a>collected by two different hands &amp; reduced into the two forms now <a id="l646"></a>extant in the books of Ezra &amp; the first book of Esdras, &amp; the <a id="l647"></a>story of the three young men was inserted into the latter out of some <a id="l648"></a>other writing. For if that story be omitted the  books agree. And at the <a id="l649"></a>same time a part of the Prophesies of Isaiah was scattered from the <a id="l650"></a>rest &amp; added to the end of the Prophesy of Zechary &amp; the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel was lost. Now that Ezra <a id="l651"></a>did not write the books of the Kings &amp; Chronicles in his own stile <a id="l652"></a>but copied them out of former records I gather from hence, that <a id="l653"></a>where the books of the kings &amp; Chronicles agree in sence they agree <a id="l654"></a>in words &amp; that the words of Isaiah are copied in both those books. And <a id="l655"></a>the Pentateuch &amp; books of Ioshua Iudges &amp; Ruth seem to have been <a id="l656"></a>copied out of ancient Records by Samuel after the same manner. <a id="l657"></a>Samuel not using his own stile but keeping to the words of Moses <a id="l658"></a>&amp; the Records, &amp; only connecting what he transcribed out of <a id="l659"></a>several books.</p>
<p id="par68">When Christ was asked which was the great commandment <a id="l660"></a>of the Law he answered, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with <a id="l661"></a>all thy heart &amp; with all thy soul &amp; with all thy  mind. This is <a id="l662"></a>the first &amp; great Commandment. And the second is like unto it, <a id="l663"></a>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.

<p id="par69">When there  arose a question about imposing the Law of Moses upon the Gentiles <a id="l682"></a>&amp; a Council of the Apostles &amp; Elders was called at Ierusalem to consider of this matter,  <a id="l683"></a>Iames the President of the Council or Bishop of the Church of Ierusalem  said <a id="l684"></a>My sentence is that we trouble not them who from among the  <a id="l685"></a>GENTILES are turned unto God: but that we write unto them that they <a id="l686"></a> [the Gentiles] abstein from pollutions of Idols &amp; from fornication &amp; from <a id="l687"></a>things strangled &amp; from blood. For [as for the Iews] Moses of old time hath in <a id="l688"></a>every city them that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every sabbath <a id="l689"></a>day. Act 15.19, 20, 21. &amp; 21.24, 25. Which is as much as to say, that  about the  observation of <a id="l690"></a>the Law of Moses  by the Iews there is no dispute, <a id="l691"></a> but as for those who from among the Gentiles are converted unto God , they are <a id="l692"></a>to be looked upon as Proselites of the Gate &amp; nothing more is to be imposed upon <a id="l693"></a>them out of the Law then the Precepts of the sons of Noah.  <a id="l694"></a>Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become [as one] uncircumcised. <a id="l695"></a>Is any called in uncircumcision, let him not become circumcised. Circumcision is nothing <a id="l696"></a>&amp; uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of God. Let every <a id="l697"></a>man abide in the same calling [whether of circumcision or uncircumcision]  wherein he was called 1 Cor. 7.  Accordingly all the <a id="l698"></a>Church of Ierusalem kept the Law Act. 21.20 &amp; so did Paul himself Act 18.18 &amp; 21. 24. And <a id="l699"></a>because Timothy was born of a Iewish parent Paul circumcised him (Act 16.1, 3.) <a id="l700"></a>but would not suffer Titus  to be circumcised because he was a Greek <a id="l701"></a>Gal. 2.3. And the Church of Ierusalem had Bishops of the circumcision till <a id="l702"></a>the Emperor Adrian, A.C. 135, banished all the Iews out of Iudea upon pain <a id="l703"></a>of death. And this distinction between the Churches of the circumcision &amp; un<a id="l704"></a>circumcision remained till the days of Irenæus who tells us</p>
<p id="par70">The Christian religion therefore among the Gentiles is  the ancient religion of the sons of <a id="l706"></a>Noah with this addition that we are to beleive that Iesus is the Christ <a id="l707"></a> or Messiah whom the Iews expected.</p>
<p id="par71">When Christ rose from the dead, he appeared - - - &amp; communion.</p>
<p id="par72">Repentance &amp; remission of sins relate to transgressions against <a id="l708"></a>the moral Religion of the sons of Noah,   comprehended <a id="l709"></a>by Christ in the two great commandments. We are to forsake - - - <a id="l710"></a>- - let him be accursed Gal 1.8, 9. The Iudges  that are to put the laws <a id="l711"></a>of God in execution, may explain them to  ignorant people according to the best of their <a id="l712"></a>skill, (Ezra 7.25.) but if they impose their explications as a divine law in any <a id="l713"></a>other words then those  in which the Law was at first deliver<a id="l714"></a>ed by divine authority, they sit in the throne of God  &amp; act not only as Iudges according to the law of God but also as legislators in  conjunction with  God &amp; if they err they  repeale <a id="l716"></a>the laws of God,  become apostates from thise laws <a id="l717"></a>&amp;  oppose &amp; exalt themselves above every God. We are to keep to the form of sound words 2 Tim. 1.13. Titus 1.9, 14. &amp; 2.8. &amp; 1 Tim 6.3. to contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints Iude. 3. to teach no other doctrine 1 Tim. 1.3.</p>
<p id="par73">Now since Christ set on foot the Christian religion by explaining <a id="l718"></a>to his  Apostles the prophesies in Moses the Prophets &amp; the Psalms concerning <a id="l719"></a>himself &amp; sending them  to teach his interpretations to all nations:</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p31"> &lt;31&gt; </span>
<p id="par74">In matters of Religion   before the coming of Christ, the first &amp; <a id="l720"></a>great commandment was, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy <a id="l721"></a> heart &amp; with all thy soul &amp; with all thy  mind. And the <a id="l722"></a>second was like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self. On these <a id="l723"></a>two commandments hang all the Law &amp; the Prophets. Mat. 22.37.</p>

<p id="par76"> </p>
<p id="par77">To become a christian was to receive what was taught in Catechising in the beginning <a id="l727"></a>of Christianity in order to Baptism &amp; Communion  &amp; to be <a id="l728"></a>baptized &amp; admitted into communion thereupon. And nothing more was to be imposed after<a id="l729"></a>wards upon condition of communion. Other things were to be taught after Baptism but <a id="l730"></a>not imposed as necessary to communion.</p>
<p id="par78">One of the things taught in Catechising was repentance from dead works, <a id="l731"></a>that is, from the breaches of the said two great commandments. And this repentance <a id="l732"></a>is called forsaking the World  &amp; the Devil. To forsake the Devil is to <a id="l733"></a>forsake all false Gods, the worship of which is a breach of the first &amp; great <a id="l734"></a>commandment. To forsake the World [&amp; the Flesh is to  repent of covetousness &amp; ambition  <a id="l736"></a>&amp; unlawful lusts, so as to forsake them,  &amp; these things occasion trangressions against the  second commandment &amp; are by the Apostle Iohn <a id="l737"></a>called the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye &amp; the pride of life &amp; said to <a id="l738"></a>be  of the world &amp; not of God .] is to abandon the love of the <a id="l739"></a>things  of this world called by the Apostle Iohn the lust of the flesh the lust of <a id="l740"></a>the eye &amp; the pride of life, that is, the inordinate desire of weomen riches <a id="l741"></a>&amp; honour,  or effeminacy covetousness &amp; ambition which are the root of all evil against  our neighbour, &amp; the <a id="l742"></a>fountains of uncharitableness.</p>
<p id="par79">Another thing taught in catechising was faith towards God.  Proselytes were to be baptized in the name of the father son &amp; Holy Ghost <a id="l744"></a>&amp; in order thereunto they were to be taught who were the father son &amp; <a id="l745"></a>holy Ghost.  And the summary of this doctrine is called the Creed, &amp; by <a id="l746"></a>the Apostle Paul, ffaith  towards God. And all that was taught in cathechising <a id="l747"></a>is by him called Milk for Babes &amp; the first Principles of the  <a id="l748"></a>Oracles of God &amp; of the doctrine of Christ. When, saith he, for the time <a id="l749"></a>[since your conversion] ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one [cathechize you &amp;] teach you again [in Catechizing] <a id="l750"></a>which be the first Principles of the Oracles of God, &amp; are become such <a id="l751"></a>as have need of Milk &amp; not of strong meat. ffor every one that useth milk is <a id="l752"></a> [unexperienced &amp;] unskilful in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe: but strong meat <a id="l753"></a>belongeth to them that are of full age even  those who by reason of use have <a id="l754"></a> their senses exercised to discern both good &amp; evil. Therefore leaving <a id="l755"></a>the Principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection, not laying</p>
<p id="par80">And as for the Christian worship, we  are authorized in Scripture to give glory &amp; honour to God - - of <a id="l756"></a>Christs death. All this  was practised by the Christians in the Apostles days from the <a id="l757"></a>time of their admission into communion,  &amp; is included in the first principles of the doctrine of <a id="l758"></a>Christ, &amp; is sufficient to salvation. And if any one contend for any other  sort of <a id="l759"></a>worship which he cannot prove to have been  practised in the Apostles days, he may <a id="l760"></a>use it in his closet without troubling the Churches with his private sentiments.</p>
<p id="par81">Since Christ after his resurrection taught his disciples out of Moses <a id="l761"></a>&amp; the Prophets &amp; Psalms what he sent them to teach all nations, &amp; <a id="l762"></a>the Apocalyps (a Prophesy given by himself) is full of references to the pro<a id="l763"></a>phesies of the old Testament for explaining them: We are <a id="l764"></a>in studying the scriptures to com <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from p 33 &gt; </span>compare the old Testament with the new,  &amp; explain each of them by <a id="l765"></a>the relation they have to one another, <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span>  And by this means <a id="l774"></a>we shall understand that Iesus is called the Christ or Messiah to <a id="l775"></a>signify that he  - - - - with <a id="l776"></a>the breath of his lips shall slay the wicked. And so in the prophesy <a id="l777"></a>of Hosea God saith that he hath hewed Ephraim &amp; Iudah by his <a id="l778"></a>prophets &amp; slain them by the words of his mouth Hosea 6.5. And<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p34"> &lt;34&gt; </span> And the Gospel  is that Iesus the son of Mary is the Christ the <a id="l779"></a>son of God &amp;  was   was sacrificed for us upon the Cross, &amp; the third day rose again from the dead <a id="l780"></a>&amp; ascended into heaven &amp; sitteth on the right hand of God  being next to him in <a id="l781"></a>dignity &amp; dominion, &amp; shall come again to judge &amp; reign over the quick &amp; the dead <a id="l782"></a>raised again to life, &amp; that upon his  ascention he sent the Holy Ghost <a id="l783"></a>to comfort his disciples, &amp; assist them in preaching this Gospel to all nations.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from p 31 resumes &gt; </span><span class="pagenumber" id="p32"> &lt;32&gt; </span>
<p id="par82">Here the Apostle under the name of milk for babes comprehends <a id="l784"></a>all that was to be taught before baptism &amp; admission into communion, &amp;  <a id="l785"></a>under the name of strong meats he comprehends all that was  to be learnt afterwards. <a id="l786"></a> by studying the Scriptures or  otherwise. And since strong meats are not fit for babes, it is certain that they <a id="l787"></a>were not to be imposed on all men, but only to be learnt by such as after admission into communion were <a id="l788"></a>able to learn them. And by consequence men were not to damn or excommu<a id="l789"></a>nicate one another or treat one another as heretiques  or quarrel with one another <a id="l790"></a>or hate  or despise or censure one another for not knowing them. Every man after admission into communion was to <a id="l791"></a>study the scriptures, &amp; especially the Prophesies &amp; to learn as much as he could out of <a id="l792"></a>them, &amp;  might instruct his neighbour in a friendly manner but not to fall out with him <a id="l793"></a>for differing in opinion about any thing which was not imposed before baptism <a id="l794"></a>&amp; admission into communion. For this sort of enmity is contrary to the rule of Charity <a id="l795"></a>imposed upon all men in the second of the two great commandments.</p>

<p id="par84">All Christians agree that we may  give glory &amp; honour to God the <a id="l804"></a>father because he hath created all things &amp; to the Lamb of God because <a id="l805"></a>he hath redeemed us with his blood, &amp; that we may  pray to God the <a id="l806"></a>father in the name of Christ for what we want &amp; give him thanks for <a id="l807"></a>what we receive &amp; wish for grace &amp; peace  from God &amp; Christ <a id="l808"></a>&amp; the Holy Ghost, &amp; baptize in their name, &amp; receive the Eucharist in <a id="l809"></a>memory of Christs death. And all this worship &amp; practise is included in the <a id="l810"></a>first principles of the doctrine of Christ &amp; is sufficient for salvation <a id="l811"></a>And if any man hath a mind to add to this worship, he may do it in his <a id="l812"></a>closet without troubling the Churches with his private sentiments.</p>
<p id="par85">If you would know the meaning of the several names given to <a id="l813"></a>Christ in preaching the Gospel, you are  to have recourse not to Metaphysicks <a id="l814"></a>&amp; Philosophy but to the scriptures of the old Testament. ffor Christ sent not <a id="l815"></a>his disciples to preach Metaphysicks  to the common people &amp; to their <a id="l816"></a>wives &amp; children, but  expounded to them  out of Moses &amp; <a id="l817"></a>the Prophets &amp; Psalms the things concerning himself &amp; opened their understanding <a id="l818"></a>that they might understand the scriptures &amp; then sent them to teach all <a id="l819"></a>nations what he had taught them. And the Apostle bids us beware of <a id="l820"></a>vain philosophy. If you would therefore know why  Iesus is called the <a id="l821"></a>Christ, the son of God, the son of man, the Lamb of God, the Word of God, &amp;c <a id="l822"></a>you must have recourse to the old Testament, &amp; there you will find that <a id="l823"></a>he is called the <em class="underline">Christ</em> or <em class="underline"> Messiah</em> to signify that he is the <em class="underline">Messiah</em> who <a id="l824"></a>was spoken of in Daniels Prophesy of the 70 weeks. The <em class="underline">son of man</em> to signi<a id="l825"></a>fy that he is the person of whom Daniel writes in saying,  Behold one like the <a id="l826"></a><em class="underline">son of man</em> came with the clouds of heaven: &amp; there was given him dominion <a id="l827"></a>&amp; glory &amp; a kingdom that all people nations &amp; languages should serve  <a id="l828"></a>him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion.  The <em class="underline">son of God</em> to signify <a id="l829"></a>that he is the person spoken of in the second Psalm in these words: The <a id="l830"></a>Lord hath said unto me Thou art my son this day have I begotten thee <a id="l831"></a>Ask of me &amp; I will give the heathen for thine inheritance &amp; the ends <a id="l832"></a>of the earth for thy possession: thou shalt break them with a rod of iron, <a id="l833"></a>&amp; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potters vessel. The <em class="underline">Lamb of God</em> <a id="l834"></a>to signify that he was prefigured in the Paschal Lamb ordeined by Moses <a id="l835"></a>The <em class="underline">Word of God</em>.</p>

<p id="par86">He is also called Michael  in Apoc 12,  &amp; this with reference <a id="l836"></a>to the same name in Daniel chap 10 &amp; 12, to signify that he is that Michael the great Prince who in <a id="l837"></a>the end of the world shall stand up for the children of Daniels people &amp; <a id="l838"></a>who in the days of Daniel helped the Angel Gabriel against the Prince of <a id="l839"></a>the kingdom of Persia &amp; who alone held with &amp; assisted the Angel Gabriel in matters of <a id="l840"></a>prophesy &amp; is there called the Prince of Daniels people, &amp; by consequence is <a id="l841"></a>the Prince of the Host &amp; the Prince of Princes spoken of in Daniels prophesy <a id="l842"></a>of the Ram &amp; He Goat. And from the last horn of  the He Goat which stands up <a id="l843"></a>against this Prince of Princes,  the  name Antichrist hath been taken. <a id="l844"></a>But these difficulter points are to be  recconed rather  among the <a id="l845"></a>strong meat then  among the first principles of the doctrine <a id="l846"></a>of Christ.</p>
<p id="par87">And so the name of <em class="underline">Antichrist</em> has been taken from the old Testament <a id="l847"></a>&amp; has relation to the last horn of the He Goat which  magnified it self against the Prince of the Host &amp; stood up against the Prince of <a id="l849"></a>Princes.

<p id="par91">And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy <a id="l888"></a>self. Vpon these two hang all the  Law &amp; the Prophets. These two command<a id="l889"></a>ments always have &amp; always will be  the duty of all nations &amp; The coming <a id="l890"></a>of Iesus Christ has made no alteration in them.  For As often as mankind has <a id="l891"></a>swerved from them God has made a reformation. When the sons of Adam erred &amp; <a id="l892"></a>the thoughts of their heart became evil continually God selected Noah to people a new <a id="l893"></a>world &amp; when the posterity of Noah transgressed &amp; began to  invoke  <a id="l894"></a>dead men God selected Abraham &amp; his posterity &amp; when they transgressed in Egypt God <a id="l895"></a>reformed them by Moses &amp;  when they relapsed to idolatry <a id="l896"></a>&amp; immorality God sent Prophets to reform them &amp; punished them by the Babylonian captivity &amp; when they that returned from captivity mixed human inventions <a id="l898"></a>with the law of Moses under the name of traditions &amp; laid the stress of religion not upon <a id="l899"></a>the acts of the mind but upon outward acts &amp; ceremonies God sent Christ to reform <a id="l900"></a>them &amp; when the nation received him not God called the Gentiles, &amp; now the Gentiles <a id="l901"></a>have corrupted themselves we may expect that God in due time will make a new refor<a id="l902"></a>mation. And in all the reformations of religion hitherto made the religion in respect of God &amp; <a id="l903"></a>our neighbour is one &amp; the same  religion (barring ceremonies &amp; forms of government <a id="l904"></a>which are of a changeable nature) so that this is the oldest religion in the world &amp; <a id="l905"></a>All other religions have been set on foot for politique ends, this is of a contrary natur<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l906"></a>The heathens out of flattery worshipped the ancestors of their kings &amp; the Mahometans the founder of their Empire such religions men are prone to: but Abraham fled his country for the sake of his religion &amp; Christ &amp; his disciples <a id="l907"></a>suffered  persecutions even unto death for 300 years together for the sake of theirs.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p36"> &lt;36&gt; </span>
<p id="par92">Now to this ancient religion there was added  upon the death <a id="l908"></a>&amp; resurrection of Iesus Christ a new duty  which relates to Gods government <a id="l909"></a>of the world, namely that we should beleive that God hath raised Iesus Christ from the <a id="l910"></a>dead [&amp;  exalted him above all men &amp; made him their Iudge <a id="l911"></a>&amp; king] &amp; will at length raise all men from the dead to be judged by him &amp; <a id="l912"></a>rewarded according to their deeds &amp; that God hath given Iesus Christ a kingdom <a id="l913"></a>to be selected out of the best of those men who rise from the dead, whose <a id="l914"></a>sins shall be remitted  by God almighty at the <a id="l915"></a>request of Iesus Christ. For all men except Christ are sinners &amp;  might in justice be <a id="l916"></a>punished for their sinns. But  Christ  by his obedience to God <a id="l917"></a>&amp; particularly by his submitting to God's will even to dye an ignominious &amp; painful <a id="l918"></a>death upon the Cross as an example to teach us absolute obedience in all things to <a id="l919"></a>God's will, has so far pleased God as to merit of him a kingdom &amp; that God <a id="l920"></a>should forgive the sins of all those whom he shall chuse to be his subjects <a id="l921"></a>&amp;  therefore he is said to have made an attonement for us &amp; to have <a id="l922"></a>satisfied Gods wrath &amp; merited our pardon &amp; to have washed away our sins in his blood &amp; made <a id="l923"></a>us kings &amp; Priests. For a man to forgive  injuries without <a id="l924"></a>satisfaction made to him is no injustice. It's an act of mercy &amp; more commendable then <a id="l925"></a>to forgive  injuries upon satisfaction made. Its our duty to do so <a id="l926"></a> &amp; God has in effect commanded us to do it if we expect to have our <a id="l927"></a>sins forgiven. And that which is an act of mercy, a duty  commanded a commendable meritorious <a id="l928"></a>act in us cannot be injustice in God. If we pray that God would for<a id="l929"></a>give us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us <a id="l930"></a>&amp; the meaning of the prayer is that  that God would be merciful to us as we are merciful to others <a id="l933"></a>&amp; forgive us as we forgive others  without insisting upon justice.  Certainly <a id="l934"></a> it is as  lawful for God as for us to forgive injuries without satisfaction of justice. <a id="l935"></a> If we may forgive  <a id="l936"></a>a malefactor tho we do not know but that it may redound to the <a id="l937"></a>injury of another by the future misdemeanours of that malefactor, much <a id="l938"></a>more may God forgive malefactors  whenever he foreknows that it will be of no ill <a id="l940"></a>consequence. If a favorite of a king by  serving him  <a id="l941"></a>has gained his favour, &amp; by interceding with  him for an offender <a id="l942"></a>who has deserved death,  obteins  a pardon for the offender, this <a id="l943"></a>is  appeasing the kings wrath, satisfying <a id="l944"></a>his justice, meriting the offenders pardon,  making an attonement &amp; <a id="l945"></a>reconciliation for him:  without paying a debt by way of equity: &amp; why may not <a id="l946"></a>Christ have done all this without paying a debt for us by way <a id="l947"></a>of an equivalent. If Christ by his death has merited a kingdom &amp; without <a id="l948"></a>his merit no such kingdom would have been erected  tis certain <a id="l949"></a>that without his merit no such kingdom would have been erected, &amp; we <a id="l950"></a>must have been content with such a state as would have fallen to our lot <a id="l951"></a>without the erecting of such a kingdom. And therefore whatever advantage <a id="l952"></a>we hope to receive in his kingdom is owing to his merits.</p>
<p id="par93">Now upon account of the benefit we are in hopes to receive <a id="l953"></a>by Christs deathe we are in gratitude to love  &amp; honour him &amp; to <a id="l954"></a>behave our selves towards him as our lord &amp; king. For tho there <a id="l955"></a>be gods many &amp; Lords many yet to us there is but one God the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p37"> &lt;37&gt; </span>father of whom are all things &amp;  we  in <a id="l956"></a>him &amp; one Lord Iesus Christ by whom are all things &amp; we by him.</p>
<p id="par94">Now our duty to Christ  in point of gratitude is to love him <a id="l957"></a>as he loved us,  to give <a id="l958"></a>him glory &amp; honour &amp; thanks  <a id="l959"></a>as he is the  Lamb of God &amp; the great High Priest who hath offered himself a sacrifice for us to  God &amp; redeemed us with his blood   to beleive  that he is the great Prophet <a id="l960"></a>to whom alone God reveales himself immediately &amp; whose testimony is the spirit of prophesy &amp; who is therefore <a id="l961"></a>called the <span class="large">Word of God</span>, to beleive that he is the great High Priest <a id="l962"></a>who offers up our prayers to God &amp; in whose name we are to direct all <a id="l963"></a>our prayers to the father, to beleive that he is the great king, the king <a id="l964"></a>of kings &amp; lord of lords &amp; on that account to  obey all his commands &amp; to <a id="l965"></a>give him glory &amp; honour</p>

<p id="par97">2 And the second is like unto it</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p39"> &lt;39&gt; </span>
<p id="par98">In matters of Religion in all ages the first &amp; great command<a id="l979"></a>ment is Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart &amp; with all thy soul &amp; with <a id="l980"></a>all thy mind. And the second is like unto it, Thou <a id="l981"></a>shalt love thy neighbour  as thy self. On these two hung all the <a id="l982"></a>Law &amp; the Prophets. Mat 22.27.</p>
<p id="par99">When Christ rose from the dead he  appeared to his disciples to prove to them his resurrection &amp; expounded to them out of Moses &amp; all the Prophets <a id="l984"></a>&amp; the Psalms  the things concerning himself, viz<sup>t</sup> how that <a id="l985"></a>the Christ ought to suffer &amp; to rise from the dead the 3<sup>d</sup> day &amp; to enter into his <a id="l986"></a> glory, &amp; that he was the Christ in whom all these things were fulfilled <a id="l987"></a>&amp; that repentance &amp; remission of Sins  should be preached in his name among <a id="l988"></a>all nations beginning at Ierusalem. Luke 24.21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 44, 45, 46, 47.  <a id="l989"></a>And that upon his resurrection from the dead all power was given him in heaven <a id="l990"></a>&amp; in earth, &amp; he would send the promise of his father upon them (viz<sup>t</sup> the Holy <a id="l991"></a>Ghost) whereby they should be endued with power from on high, &amp; should then <a id="l992"></a>go &amp; teach all nations what he had  taught them, &amp; should baptize them in the <a id="l993"></a>name of the father &amp; of the son &amp; of the Holy Ghost, &amp; <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>that<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> he would be with <a id="l994"></a>them &amp; their disciples &amp; the disciples of their disciples always unto the end <a id="l995"></a>of the world. And after these things he ascended up into heaven   in their sight &amp; they were told by an Angel that he should come again in the same manner as they saw him ascend. And all this is the Gospel. Mat 28.18, 19, 20. Luke 24.49, 50.  the Gospel <a id="l996"></a>which Christ taught his disciples after his resurrection, &amp; sent <a id="l997"></a>them to teach all nations, &amp; which the first Christians were taught in <a id="l998"></a>catechising them before baptism.</p>
<p id="par100">Repentance &amp; remission of sins relates to the transgressions against <a id="l999"></a>the two first commandments. We are to forsake the Devil that is <a id="l1000"></a>all fals Gods &amp; all manner of Idolatry this being a breach of the <a id="l1001"></a>first &amp; great commandment. And we are to forsake the flesh &amp; the world , or as St Iohn expresses it,  the lust <a id="l1003"></a>of the flesh the lust of the eye &amp; the pride of life; that is <a id="l1004"></a> unchastity covetousness &amp; ambition; these things being a <a id="l1005"></a>breach of the second  of the two great Commandments. And we <a id="l1006"></a>are to beleive in one God the father almighty in dominion, the maker <a id="l1007"></a>of heaven &amp; earth &amp; in one Lord Iesus Christ the son of God,  who was born of a Virgin  &amp; sacrificed for us on the Cross &amp; the third day rose <a id="l1009"></a>again from the dead, &amp; ascended into heaven,  &amp;  sitteth on the right hand of <a id="l1010"></a>God,  being next to him in honour &amp; power, &amp; shall come again to judge <a id="l1011"></a>the quick &amp; the dead raised again to life, &amp; who   sent the Holy Ghost <a id="l1012"></a>to comfort his disciples.  This repentance  &amp; this faith was taught in cate<a id="l1013"></a>chising from the beginning in the eastern churches &amp; was sufficient for baptism communion &amp; salvation. [And to damn <a id="l1014"></a>or exclude from communion such men as beleive &amp; practise all this would be an <a id="l1015"></a>act of uncharitableness.</p>
<p id="par101">This repentance &amp; this faith  &amp; Baptism &amp; admission into communi<a id="l1016"></a>on by imposition of hands, is by the Apostle called milk for Babes &amp; the <a id="l1017"></a>first Principles of the doctrine of Christ. Those things which are to be <a id="l1018"></a>learnt after admission into communion he calls strong meats for men <a id="l1019"></a>of riper years. Heb. 5.12, 13, 14 &amp; 6.1, 2. / And strong meats are not fit <a id="l1020"></a>for Babes &amp; therefore are not to be imposed on all Christians including <a id="l1021"></a>Babes. Every man is to be fed with milk untill he be baptized &amp; admitted into <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p40"> &lt;40&gt; </span>And Pausanias tells us that the Belus at Babylon had his name from Belus an <a id="l1022"></a>Egyptian, the son of Libya.<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p41"> &lt;41&gt; </span> communion. And nothing more is to be imposed  as necessary to commu<a id="l1023"></a>nion &amp; salvation then what was taught (from the beginning of the Gospel) <a id="l1024"></a>before baptism &amp; admission into communion. Men are afterwards to study the <a id="l1025"></a>scriptures to the end of their lives &amp; learn as much as they can out of them &amp; live according to what <a id="l1026"></a>they learn. And these things the Apostle calls strong meats for men of riper years who <a id="l1027"></a>have their senses exercised to discern both good &amp; evil. And The feeding on these meats he calls going on <a id="l1028"></a>unto perfection. But when we have learnt any of these things we are not <a id="l1029"></a>to impose them upon our neighbours. We may  teach them to him in a friendly manner, but if he is weak &amp; unable to receive them we are not to fall out with him about <a id="l1031"></a>them; much less are we to pronounce him damned or tax him with heresy <a id="l1032"></a>or break communion with him, or to hurt him in his body or goods on that <a id="l1033"></a>account.  On the contrary the strong must not despise the weak  and the <a id="l1034"></a>weak must not judge &amp; censure the strong: but all men who agree in the funda<a id="l1035"></a>mental principles of religion  by the Apostle called milk <a id="l1037"></a>for babes must be tender towards one another &amp; continue to love one another notwithstanding any differences <a id="l1038"></a>in opinions concerning the higher points of religion by him called strong meats <a id="l1039"></a>for them of riper years. Hast thou faith in these higher matters, have <a id="l1040"></a>it to thy self &amp; do not give offence to thy weak brother for whom Christ <a id="l1041"></a>died by imposing more upon  him then he can bear or then <a id="l1042"></a>Christ hath imposed, &amp; thereby  prejudicing him against the <a id="l1043"></a>Christian religion. For this is contrary to the second of the two great <a id="l1044"></a>commandments, <em class="underline">Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self</em>. And from <a id="l1045"></a>this sort of uncharitableness almost all the warrs &amp; discords which have <a id="l1046"></a>been among Christians in relation to religion, have had their rise, &amp;</p>
<p id="par102"> Now concerning the faith which Christ taught his disciples <a id="l1047"></a>after his resurrection &amp; sent them to teach all nations before bap<a id="l1048"></a>tism it is to be observed that he taught it out of  Moses &amp; <a id="l1049"></a>the Prophets &amp; Psalms, opening their understandings that they might <a id="l1050"></a> understand what was written concerning him. And therefore for understanding this faith <a id="l1051"></a>aright we must have recourse to the prophesies of the old Testament <a id="l1052"></a>concerning him, &amp; which were fulfilled  in him. And the chief of these pro<a id="l1053"></a>phesies are pointed at by the several names given to him with <a id="l1054"></a>relation to them &amp; explain those names. He is called the <a id="l1055"></a> Christ or Messiah to signify that he is that Messiah who <a id="l1056"></a>was annointed by his death at the end of Daniels 70 weeks of <a id="l1057"></a>years; the son of Man to signify that he is the person whom <a id="l1058"></a>Daniel saw like the son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven to receive a kingdom <a id="l1059"></a>that all  people nations &amp; languages should serve him: the <a id="l1060"></a>son of God to signify that he is the person of whom God said, Thou art <a id="l1061"></a>my son, this day have I begotten thee; ask of me &amp; I will give thee <a id="l1062"></a>the heathen for thine inheritance &amp; the  uttermost <a id="l1063"></a>parts of the earth for  thy possession. Thou shalt <a id="l1064"></a>break them with a rod of iron &amp; dash them in pieces like a Potters <a id="l1065"></a>vessel. Psal. 2. He is called the Lamb of God  to signify that he was <a id="l1066"></a>typified in the Paschal Lamb instituted by Moses, &amp; said to sit on the right <a id="l1067"></a>hand of God &amp; to be a Priest for ever after the order of Melchize<a id="l1068"></a>deck to signify that he is the person spoken of the 110<sup>th</sup> Psalm. He is <a id="l1069"></a>called the word of God with a two edged sword coming out of his mouth to signi<a id="l1070"></a>fy that he is the person spoken of in Isaiah (ch. 11) whom God <a id="l1071"></a>should make of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord to judge the poor <a id="l1072"></a>with righteousness, &amp; who shall smite the earth with the rod [or, according to the 70, with the word] of his mouth <a id="l1073"></a>&amp; with the breath of his lips shall slay the wicked. He is <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p42"> &lt;42&gt; </span>He is called the God who was in the beginning with God to <a id="l1074"></a>signify that he was that God who walked in Paradise in the cool <a id="l1075"></a>of the day &amp; sentenced Adam &amp; Eve &amp; the Serpent, &amp; by whom <a id="l1076"></a>God the father made all things in the beginning &amp; gave the promisses <a id="l1077"></a>to the Patriarchs. So then for understanding these names of Christ <a id="l1078"></a>we are to have recourse unto the old Testament &amp; to beware <a id="l1079"></a>of vain Philosophy. ffor Christ sent his Apostles not to teach Philosophy <a id="l1080"></a>to the common people &amp; to their wives &amp; children but to teach what he <a id="l1081"></a>had taught them out of Moses &amp; the Prophets &amp; Psalms concerning himself.</p>

<p id="par103">The fundamentals of the Christian religion are those &amp; only those things which <a id="l1082"></a>the primitive Christians were taught in catechising &amp; instructing them in order <a id="l1083"></a>to baptism. And those were to forsake the Devil, the lusts of the flesh the <a id="l1084"></a>lust of the eye &amp; the pride of life &amp; to beleive in one God, &amp; one Lord &amp; <sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup> <a id="l1085"></a>in the Holy Ghost. To forsake the Devil is to forsake the worship of Demons <a id="l1086"></a>or Ghosts &amp; of all fals Gods whatsoever collectively called the Devil. To <a id="l1087"></a>forsake the lusts of the flesh is to forsake all unlawful desires of weomen. <a id="l1088"></a>To forsake the lust of the eye &amp; the pride of life is to forsake cove<a id="l1089"></a>tousness &amp; ambition the roots of all evil. These vices we are to forsake as being contrary to the  fundamental Duty of loving our neighbours as our selves To beleive in one God &amp; in one <a id="l1090"></a>Lord &amp; in the Holy Ghost is to beleive in them aright in order to practise our duty towards them. In <em class="underline">one God</em> the God <a id="l1091"></a>of the Patriarchs, the Iews &amp; the Christians, the <em class="underline">father</em> who hath life in himself <a id="l1092"></a>&amp; hath given the Son to have life in himself, the author of life to all intelli<a id="l1093"></a>gent beings, the <em class="underline">Almighty</em> or universal  monarch Παντοκράτωρ,  the supreme  governour <a id="l1094"></a>of the Vniverse, <em class="underline">the maker of heaven &amp; earth</em> &amp; of all things therein <a id="l1095"></a>visible &amp; invisible.  In <em class="underline">one Lord</em>, the <em class="underline">Son</em> who hath received life from <a id="l1096"></a>the father, &amp; was <em class="underline">slain</em> for us, &amp; <em class="underline">rose again</em>  from the dead, &amp; <em class="underline">as<a id="l1097"></a>cended</em> into heaven, &amp; who  to express his being <a id="l1098"></a>next to the father in dignity &amp; dominion is said to <em class="underline">sit at the right hand <a id="l1099"></a>of God</em> the father, &amp; <em class="underline">who shall  come again to judge</em>  &amp; reign over the <em class="underline">quick</em> <a id="l1100"></a>who remain alive in the flesh, <em class="underline">&amp; the dead</em> whom he shall raise again to life <a id="l1101"></a>&amp; reward according to their works at his coming &amp; his kingdom. for he must reign till he hath put all things under his feet, the last of which is death, that is till all the dead are raised &amp; judged. And <em class="underline">in the <a id="l1102"></a>Holy Ghost</em> whom Christ promised to send to  the elect to assist &amp; comfort them &amp; to shew them <a id="l1103"></a>things to come. In <em class="underline">one God</em> whom we are to worship with  prayer because he is able to hear &amp; help us &amp; with praises &amp; thanks-giving because he created all <a id="l1105"></a>things &amp;  for his pleasure they are &amp; were created. In <em class="underline">one Lord</em> in whose name we are <a id="l1106"></a>to invoke  God the father, &amp;  whom we are to  <a id="l1107"></a>worship by giving him glory &amp; honour &amp; praise &amp; thanks as the Lamb of <a id="l1108"></a>God who was slain for us &amp; hath redeemed us with his blood. And <em class="underline">in the <a id="l1109"></a>Holy Ghost</em>  or Spirit of  truth from whom  &amp; the father <a id="l1110"></a>&amp; Son we are to wish for grace &amp; peace &amp; truth  &amp; comfort. And be<a id="l1111"></a>cause of this dependance of the Church upon all three, we are bap<a id="l1112"></a>tized in  all their names &amp; before baptism are  taught who they are  that we may be baptized in their names. And upon <a id="l1115"></a>these professions promisses &amp; covenants being baptized &amp; admitted into com<a id="l1116"></a>munion men are not afterwards to be excommunicated without breaking <a id="l1117"></a>one more of the Articles or Covenants upon which they were admitted. <a id="l1118"></a>By Catechizing &amp; Baptism men are made disciples of Christ &amp; admitted into the visible body of Christians.  By imposition of the hands of the Presbytery  of any particular church <a id="l1120"></a>they are admitted into the society &amp; communion of that Church or <a id="l1121"></a>corporation ecclesiastick. By communicatory Letters from that Church to <a id="l1122"></a>other  Churches they are admitted into the Communion of other <a id="l1123"></a>Churches, &amp; by excommunication for any fact which can be repented of they are  ex<a id="l1124"></a>pelled that Church or corporation of Christians &amp; return into the state <a id="l1125"></a>of  wicked men baptized but not yet admitted into communion &amp; <a id="l1126"></a>therefore upon repentance they are not rebaptized but ony readmitted <a id="l1127"></a>into communion. But if they  turn unbelievers and are justly  excommunicated for infidelity, they  return into <a id="l1128"></a>the state they were in before baptism, &amp; without new baptism, (which is not <a id="l1129"></a>allowed,) they are not to be readmitted into the Church. Se Heb. VI.4, 5, 6. All this <a id="l1130"></a>is what the Apostle calls the first Principles of the Oracles of God &amp; the <a id="l1131"></a>Principles of the doctrine of Christ, &amp; the milk which is to be given to babes <a id="l1132"></a>who are not yet skilled in the word of righteousness. And the foundation of <a id="l1133"></a>these Principles being once laid we are to practise what we have been taught &amp; study the scriptures &amp; become teachers of others &amp; go on unto perfection   <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p44"> &lt;44&gt; </span>
grow in grace &amp; in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ  &amp; by <a id="l1135"></a>reason of use to have our senses exercised to discern both good &amp; evil. <a id="l1136"></a>  not forgetting <a id="l1139"></a>the first Principles &amp; <em class="underline">laying again the foundation of repentance from dead <a id="l1140"></a>works &amp; of faith towards God</em> [&amp; the Lord &amp; H. Spirit] <em class="underline">&amp;</em>  <em class="underline">the doctrine of baptisms</em> [in their name] <em class="underline">&amp; of  laying on of <a id="l1142"></a>hands, &amp; of  the resurrection of the dead &amp; eternal judgment</em> [included in that <a id="l1143"></a>doctrine.] This foundation being once laid we are to leave these first principles of the Doctrine of Christ &amp; to to go  forward if god permit. <a id="l1144"></a>For if after we have been fed with the milk which belongs to  <a id="l1145"></a>babes we do not go on unto perfection using strong meats which belong to them of <a id="l1146"></a> full age but by disuse &amp; negligence grow weak &amp; faint in our <a id="l1147"></a>duty  &amp; fall away so as to need to be fed with milk anew, our case grows <a id="l1148"></a>desperate.  <em class="underline">For it is impossible for those who  were once enlightend <a id="l1149"></a>&amp; have tasted of the heavenly gift &amp; were made partakers of the Holy Ghost <a id="l1150"></a>if they shall fall away, to renew them </em> [by new catechizing] <a id="l1151"></a><em class="underline">unto repentance</em> [from dead works in order to a second baptism] <em class="underline">seing they</em> [sin <a id="l1152"></a>against the Holy Ghost &amp;] <em class="underline">crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh &amp; put him to <a id="l1153"></a>an open shame</em>.</p>
<p id="par104">It behoves us therefore after we have been once catechized baptized <a id="l1154"></a>&amp; admitted to communion, to exercise our selves in the practise of those <a id="l1155"></a>things which we have promised to perform that we may make them habitual &amp; to study the scriptures for improve<a id="l1156"></a>ing our selves in the knowledge of those things which tend to a good life &amp; yet <a id="l1157"></a>are not necessary to communion, &amp; to instruct &amp; enlighten one another in the <a id="l1158"></a>knowledge &amp; fear of  our Lord. And this we are to do in love &amp; charity without <a id="l1159"></a>breaking communion or falling out with one another. The strong are not to <a id="l1160"></a>despise the weak &amp; the weak are not to judge the strong: but where they <a id="l1161"></a>differ in opinions they are to beare with one another in all meekness humility <a id="l1162"></a>&amp; love. ffor if the strong impose their opinions as conditions of communion <a id="l1163"></a>they preach another gospel &amp; become schismaticks, &amp; if the weak set up <a id="l1164"></a>contrary opinions as conditions of communion, they   become <a id="l1165"></a>guilty of the like offences. To fall out about these matters is to become <a id="l1166"></a>carnal &amp; to relaps into the state of Babes, &amp; to need to be catechized anow in the <a id="l1167"></a> fundamental doctrine of  loving our neighbour as our selves. ffor upon <a id="l1168"></a> the like occasion the Apostle tells the Corinthians<sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup>  that he <em class="underline">could not speak <a id="l1169"></a>unto them as unto spiritual</em> [men] <em class="underline">but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in <a id="l1170"></a>Christ.

<p id="par105">The first Article of the Creed was the faith of Noah &amp; and his posterity <a id="l1176"></a>till they corrupted themselves. It was the faith  which Abraham received by a <a id="l1177"></a>tradition from Noah &amp; for the sake of which he left his native country when <a id="l1178"></a>they began to worship other Gods &amp; Idols. It was the faith enjoyned by God in <a id="l1179"></a>the first of the ten Commandments, <em class="underline">Thou shalt have no other Gods before</em> <a id="l1180"></a>me;  that is,  Thou shalt have no other Gods in thy <a id="l1181"></a>worship before me.

<p id="par106">The second Article  of the Creed was added to <a id="l1202"></a>the first upon the resurrection of Christ from the dead. At that time <a id="l1203"></a>all power  was given him in heaven &amp; in earth Matt. XXVIII.18.  <a id="l1204"></a> At that time God made Iesus whom the Iews had crucified both <a id="l1205"></a>Lord &amp; Christ. Act. II.36.  By his death he was <a id="l1206"></a>annointed to be the Prince of Israel, &amp; from that annointing had the <a id="l1207"></a>name given him of the Messiah or Christ, &amp; ascending up to <a id="l1208"></a>heaven he sat down at the right hand of God,  that is, became next in <a id="l1209"></a>dignity to the father, or as is exprest in the Apocalyps, he sat <a id="l1210"></a>down in his fathers throne as the saints are to sit down in his <a id="l1211"></a>throne.  Because he became obedient to death therefore God highly exalted him &amp; gave him a name above every <a id="l1212"></a>name that at the name of Iesus every knee should bow of <a id="l1213"></a>things in heaven &amp; things in earth &amp; things under the earth &amp; that <a id="l1214"></a>every tongue should confess that Iesus Christ is Lord to the glory <a id="l1215"></a>of God the father. This  το εἰναι ἰσα Θεω, this being worship<a id="l1216"></a>ped as the Lord, he did not assume tho before his incarnation he <a id="l1217"></a>was  ἐν μορφὴ Θεου, but humbled himself by his <a id="l1218"></a>incarnation &amp; laying aside the μορφὴ Θεου took upon himself the <a id="l1219"></a>μορφὴ δουλου &amp; was made in fashion as a man &amp; being found in fashion as a man  <a id="l1220"></a>became obedient unto death even the death of the cross &amp; therefore <a id="l1221"></a>God highly exalted him &amp; gave him the name above every name that <a id="l1222"></a>he should be worshipped as the Lord by all the creation. And hence <a id="l1223"></a>forward it became an article of faith to beleive in one Lord <a id="l1224"></a>Iesus Christ. And tho we are to worship him, yet we are to do it without  breaking the first commandment  <em class="underline">there is</em>  to be <a id="l1225"></a>(in our worship) <em class="underline">no other God but one.

VIII.5.  We are not to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p48"> &lt;48&gt; </span>not to give the worship of the father to the son nor the worship <a id="l1230"></a>of the Son to the to the father but to worship each with that worship <a id="l1231"></a>which is  proper &amp; peculiar to him. We are not to invoke the <a id="l1232"></a>Son in the name of the father but on the contrary to invoke the <a id="l1233"></a>  father in the name of the Son. We are not to give <a id="l1234"></a> glory to the father because he was slain for us  nor to the son <a id="l1235"></a>because he created all things, but on the contrary we are   to conform our <a id="l1239"></a>worship to the dictates of our Creed. We are to worship the father <a id="l1240"></a>as   God almighty maker of heaven <a id="l1241"></a>&amp; earth &amp; the son as the  Lord Iesus Christ who was slain for us <a id="l1242"></a>&amp; hath redeemed us with his blood. ‖ For this form of worship is   plainly <a id="l1243"></a>prescribed to us in the Apocalyps where the scene of the visions is <a id="l1244"></a>in the Temple &amp; God the father is represented sitting there upon his throne <a id="l1245"></a>that is, above the Ark between the Cherubims, &amp; the son is represented <a id="l1246"></a>in the form of a Lamb receiving the book of prophesy from him <a id="l1247"></a>that sitteth upon the throne &amp; the Presbytery &amp; People are repre<a id="l1248"></a>sented by four &amp; twenty Elders &amp; four Beasts  <a id="l1249"></a>worshipping in the courts of the Temple. And the four Beasts <a id="l1250"></a>rest not day &amp; night (or morning &amp; evening) saying <em class="underline">Holy, holy holy <a id="l1251"></a>Lord God almighty which was &amp; is &amp; is to come</em>. And when those Beasts <a id="l1252"></a><em class="underline">give glory &amp; honour &amp; thanks to him that sitteth upon the throne who <a id="l1253"></a>liveth for ever &amp; ever</em>, the four &amp; twenty Elders fall down before <a id="l1254"></a>him that sat on the throne &amp; worship him that liveth for ever &amp; <a id="l1255"></a>ever &amp; cast their crowns before the throne saying, <em class="underline">Thou art worthy <a id="l1256"></a> o Lord to receive glory &amp; honour &amp; power: for thou hast created <a id="l1257"></a>all things &amp; for thy pleasure they are &amp; were created</em>. This is the <a id="l1258"></a>worship of God the father &amp; now follows the worship of the Lord <a id="l1259"></a>Iesus Christ partly alone &amp; partly in conjunction with the father.</p>
<p id="par107">And the Lamb took the book out of the right hand of him that <a id="l1260"></a>sat upon the throne.

And the four beasts said <em class="underline">Amen</em>. And the <a id="l1274"></a>four &amp; twenty Elders <em class="underline">fell down &amp; worshipped  him that <a id="l1275"></a>liveth for ever &amp; ever</em>. This is the worship which is due to the <a id="l1276"></a>father &amp; the son. It beginns &amp; ends with the father: And it is <a id="l1277"></a>given to the son by the name of the LAMB  to signify that <a id="l1278"></a>it  relates to him as he is the Lamb of God that was slain for us <a id="l1279"></a>&amp; hath redeemed us with his blood. And this is all the worship which <a id="l1280"></a>is necessary to be given to the Lord in order to salvation, &amp; all that we are <a id="l1281"></a>authorized from heaven to give him, &amp; by consequence all that ought to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p49"> &lt;49&gt; </span> required of us in order to communion. And by reason of this difference of worship <a id="l1282"></a>it is that we are taught in our Creed to beleive in one God &amp; one Lord.</p>

And the attaining all that is to be learnt after admission into communion the <a id="l1290"></a>Apostle calls going on to perfection &amp; compares it to  strong meats for them that are of  age &amp; by means <a id="l1291"></a>of   use have their senses exercised to discern both good &amp; evil. And about <a id="l1292"></a>these things men are not to break communion with one another nor to fall out <a id="l1293"></a>The strong must not despise the weak &amp; the weak must not judge the strong <a id="l1294"></a> provided they agree in the fundamentals. </p>
<p id="par109">The fundamentals requisite to communion in the Church of England <a id="l1295"></a>are 1 To renounce the Devil &amp; all his works, the vain pomp &amp; glory of the <a id="l1296"></a>world with all the covetous desires of the same, &amp; the carnall desires of the <a id="l1297"></a>flesh so as not to  follow nor be led by them.  that is, to renounce idolatry, ambition, pride covetousness, &amp; <a id="l1299"></a>unchastity. And this the Apostle calls repentance from dead works. 2 To profess the <a id="l1300"></a> faith  conteined in the Creed usually called the Apostles Creed. And the <a id="l1301"></a>profession of faith in the primitive Church the Apostle calls faith towards God &amp; the resurrection of the dead &amp; eternal judgment. <a id="l1302"></a>3 To keep Gods commandments; that is the ten commandments, as is explained in <a id="l1303"></a>the Church Catechism.  These &amp; baptism &amp; laying on of hands are all the fundamentalls requisite to com<a id="l1304"></a>munion in the Church of England. And therefore to excommunicate any man <a id="l1305"></a>for any thing else is   contrary to the fundamental constitution of this Church. <a id="l1306"></a>It is to excommunicate a man who according to the  fundamental consti<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>tu<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><a id="l1307"></a>tion  &amp; express declaration of this Church became by baptism &amp; laying on of h<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ands<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> a member of <a id="l1308"></a>Christ a child of God &amp; an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven, &amp; may be still so <a id="l1309"></a>as much as he was at his  admission into communion for any thing objected against him.</p>
<p id="par110">The Constantinopolitan Creed usually called the Nicene Creed &amp; the Creed usually <a id="l1310"></a>called the Creed of Athanasius are not therefore any part of the milk for babes <a id="l1311"></a>in the Church of England but are to be referred to the strong meats for them <a id="l1312"></a>that are of  age, &amp; therefore to fall out about them proceeds from the <a id="l1313"></a>want of Charity. They are indeed appointed  by the Common prayer book <a id="l1314"></a>to be read in the Churches upon certain occasions. And so are many <a id="l1315"></a>parts of the Scriptures which we do not understand. As Daniel 9. &amp; 10 v. 5. Apoc 1. &amp; 4 <a id="l1316"></a>&amp; 7. v 2 to v 13 &amp; 12 v. 7 to v. 13 &amp; 14. v. 1 to v 6. &amp; 19. v.1 to v. 17. &amp; 22. We dayly dispute: <a id="l1317"></a>about the meaning of these &amp; many other parts of scripture  without falling out <a id="l1318"></a>about them &amp; are allowed to do so,  And so we may about the meaning <a id="l1319"></a>of the two Creeds  notwithstanding their <a id="l1320"></a>being read in Churches.</p>
<p id="par111">The Church of England in her 21<sup>th</sup> Article  hath declared that General <a id="l1321"></a>Councils ( forasmuch as they be an Assembly of men whereof all be not <a id="l1322"></a>governed  with the spirit &amp; word of God) may err &amp; sometimes have erred even in things <a id="l1323"></a>pertaining unto God: &amp; therefore things ordeined by them as necessary to salvation, <a id="l1324"></a>have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they are <a id="l1325"></a>taken out of the holy scriptures. And in the 8<sup>th</sup> Articles she declares that <a id="l1326"></a>the three Creeds are to be received because they may be proved by most certain <a id="l1327"></a>Warrants of  holy scripture. She doth not require us to receive them by <a id="l1328"></a>authority of general Councils &amp; much less by authority of Convocations, but   becaus they are taken out of the scriptures <a id="l1330"></a>And therefore  we are authorized by the Church to compare them with the scriptures <a id="l1331"></a>&amp; see how &amp; in what sence they can be deduced from thence. And where we <a id="l1332"></a>cannot see the deduction we are not to rely upon the Authority of Councils or <a id="l1333"></a>Synods, but may endeavour to learn from others how they may be deduced, &amp; <a id="l1334"></a>those others are not to fall out with us for doing so.</p>

<p id="par112">The Council of  Ephesus which was one of the four general Coun<a id="l1335"></a>cils, ordeined that nothing should be added to the  Constantinopolitan Creed now <a id="l1336"></a>commonly called the Nicene. And yet the Latines had added the filioque to this <a id="l1337"></a>Creed, &amp; the Church of England has ordered this Creed with the addition <a id="l1338"></a>to be read in Churches, contrary to the Decree of one of the four general Coun<a id="l1339"></a>cills. And other things which are not in the Constantinopolitan Creed are added in the Creed usually attributed to Athanasius <a id="l1340"></a> contrary to said Decree of the Council of Ephesus. The Church of England <a id="l1341"></a>therefore lays no stress upon General Councils but grounds all her religion upon <a id="l1342"></a>the scriptures.</p>
<p id="par113">The Church of England in her sixt Article declares that the Holy Scripture <a id="l1343"></a>conteins all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein <a id="l1344"></a>nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any Man that it should <a id="l1345"></a>be beleived as an Article of faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to sal<a id="l1346"></a>vation. And in her eighth Article she  saith only of the three Creeds that <a id="l1347"></a>they ought throughly to be received because they may be proved by certain warrants <a id="l1348"></a>of  holy Scripture. Tis not upon the authority of General Councills, not upon <a id="l1349"></a>authority of Convocations or any Church authority but upon that of the holy Scriptures <a id="l1350"></a>that she recommends them to be received. And in her 19 20<sup>th</sup> &amp; 21<sup>th</sup> Articles that the <a id="l1351"></a>Churches as those of Ierusalem Alexandria Antioch &amp; Rome &amp;c &amp; even general Councils <a id="l1352"></a>have erred &amp; may erre even in matters of faith &amp; what they decree as necessary to <a id="l1353"></a>salvation is of no strength or authority unless they can be shewn to be taken from <a id="l1354"></a>the holy scriptures.</p>
