    <span class="pagenumber" id="p001r"> &lt;1r&gt; </span><h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Sect. II. <a id="l1"></a><br>Of the Woman &amp; two-horned Beast.</h2>
        <p id="par1">In this Prophesy the scene of the visions is the Temple, <a id="l2"></a>&amp; the worship of the Christians is described in the Temple under the <a id="l3"></a>form of the Jewish worship as we shewed above. And hence the Christi<a id="l4"></a>an Churches are represented in this Prophesy by the twelve tribes of <a id="l5"></a>Israel &amp; when some are numbered out of the twelve Tribes &amp; sealed <a id="l6"></a>with the seale of God, the rest of the Tribes who are not sealed become <a id="l7"></a>the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews &amp; are not, that is, <a id="l8"></a>who profess themselves Christians but are the Church of Satan. <a id="l9"></a>For all men whose names are not written in the book of life, <a id="l10"></a>that is, all who are not sealed with the seale of God, wonder after <a id="l11"></a>the Beast &amp; worship him &amp; his Image &amp; receive his mark. When <a id="l12"></a>the saints are numbered &amp; sealed out of the twelve Tribes the <a id="l13"></a>rest of Tribes receive the mark of the Beast &amp; become the <a id="l14"></a>synagogue of Satan &amp; therefore they that have the mark of the <a id="l15"></a>Beast &amp; worship him &amp; his Image are Christians in outward pro<a id="l16"></a>fession.</p>
        <p id="par2">And as the Tribes of Israel &amp; Judah are in the old Testament <a id="l17"></a>represented by weomen, so the Church of Christ signified by those <a id="l18"></a>Tribes in here represented by the Lambs' wife &amp; by the glorious <a id="l19"></a>woman in heaven. For this woman was cloathed with the Sun of righteousness &amp; had the new moon &amp; Jewish ceremonies under her feet &amp; upon her head a crown of twelve stars <a id="l20"></a>which are the twelve Apostles, &amp; her seed keep the commandments <a id="l21"></a>of God &amp; have the testimony of Jesus, &amp; therefore she is the <a id="l22"></a>Church. In the first ages of Christianity she is the true sin<a id="l23"></a>cere Church of Christ diffused through the whole Roman <a id="l24"></a>Empire represented by the Dragon: but upon the division <a id="l25"></a>of the Empire into two Empires represented by the Dragon <a id="l26"></a>ten-horned Beast, the Church also becomes divided into <a id="l27"></a>two Churches represented by the Woman &amp; the two-horned Beast. <a id="l28"></a>For upon this division of the Empire the woman &amp; Dragon part from one another. She flees from the Dragon into the <a id="l29"></a>western Empire called a wilderness for its spiritual barren<a id="l30"></a>ness &amp; desolation, &amp; leaves behind her [in the dominion of the Dragon] <a id="l31"></a>a remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of <a id="l32"></a>God &amp; have the testimony of Jesus, &amp; the Dragon goes from <a id="l33"></a>the Woman to make war upon that remnant. And as the <a id="l34"></a> ten horned Beast rises out of the Sea to succeed the Dragon in <a id="l35"></a>the western Empire so the two horned Beast rises out of the <a id="l36"></a>Earth to suceed the Woman in the eastern Empire.</p>
        <p id="par3">Every kingdom hath its  <a id="l37"></a>Church, &amp; the Churches of the Dragon &amp; <a id="l38"></a>ten horned Beast are the two-horned Beast &amp; Woman in the <a id="l39"></a>wilderness.</p>
        <p id="par4">For When she fled into the wilderness she fled from the <a id="l40"></a>Dragon &amp; therefore ceased to be his Church. She was afterwards <a id="l41"></a>found in the wilderness sitting upon the ten horned Beast, that is, reign<a id="l42"></a>ing over him &amp; therefore became his Church. She is the great city <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> which reigns over the kings of the earth represented by the ten <a id="l43"></a>horns of the Beast. She is Babylon the great, the western Ba<a id="l44"></a>bylon, the great city seated upon seven hills &amp; by consequence <a id="l45"></a>the Church of Rome, &amp; this Church is the Church catholick <a id="l46"></a>of the western kingdoms &amp; nations into which the Latine ~ <a id="l47"></a>Empire is now divided.</p>
           <p id="par5">And as for the two horned Beast he rose out <a id="l48"></a>of the earth or nations of the eastern Empire &amp; <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>therefore<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l49"></a>is seated in that Empire. He hath two horns like the Lamb <a id="l50"></a>that is two Churches like the seven Churches of Asia signi<a id="l51"></a>fied by the seven horns of the Lamb, &amp; therefore is an ec<a id="l52"></a>clesiastical body. He speaks as the Dragon &amp; therefore is of <a id="l53"></a>the Dragon's religion. And <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>as<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> a Church in the eastern Empire of the <a id="l54"></a>Dragons language &amp; religion is the Greek Church. This Beast by fals mira<a id="l55"></a>cles deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, &amp; for doing so is called the fals Prophet &amp; therefore is of an ecclsiastical kind, <a id="l56"></a>&amp; this fals Prophet survives the Whore of Babylon being cast alive <a id="l57"></a>into the lake of fire after the ten kings have eaten the flesh <a id="l58"></a>of the Whore &amp; burnt her with fire, &amp; therefore this Prophet <a id="l59"></a>differs from the Whore &amp; signifies another idolatrous Church <a id="l60"></a>&amp; by consequence the Greek Church or Church of the Greek Empire.</p>
     <span class="pagenumber" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span>
        <p id="par6" class="i0">Lord,</p>
        <p id="par7">Altho the two witneses prophesy all the time of the Trumpets yet they do not prophesy all that time <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>in sackcloths<span class="nb-n">}</span></span></p>
        <p id="par8"></p>
        <p id="par9"> with the plagues of the seven <a id="l61"></a>Trumpets. They &amp; the seven Angels cooperate in executing those plagues, &amp; therefore they prophesy <a id="l62"></a>all the times of those plagues. But yet they do not wear sackcloth all that time. When the <a id="l63"></a>Abomination of the wilderness called by Daniel the abomination of desolation is set up then they  put on sackcloth. The nations [who tread under foot <a id="l64"></a>the holy city] are not completely Gentiles till the worship of Images be set up. From that time the Gentiles <a id="l65"></a>tread under foot the holy city 42 months.</p>
        <p id="par10">They that worship in that Temple &amp; have the testimony of Jesus are mysticaly killed for not worshipping the Image of <a id="l66"></a>the Beast &amp; in that respect  the 144000 are called the first <a id="l67"></a>fruits into God &amp; are his martyrs or Witnesses. They sing a new song on mount Sion with harps <a id="l68"></a>&amp; in that respect they are Prophets. For  singing with musical instruments in prophesying <a id="l69"></a>1 Chron 25. 1, 2, 3. 2 King. 3.15 1 Sam 10.5. And in their mouth was found no <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>lye<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l70"></a>&amp; therefore they are true witnesses &amp; true prophets.</p>
        <p id="par11">And as they that worship God in the second Temple are called Witnesses &amp; Prophets <a id="l71"></a>&amp; worship in the inner court of the Temple while the outward court is given to the <a id="l72"></a>Gentiles so they that have the names of God on their foreheads &amp; worship in the firstin the first Temple are <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span> Gods witnesses &amp; Prophets &amp; worship in the <a id="l74"></a>inner Court of that Temple while those that have name or mark of the Beast worship <a id="l75"></a>the Image of the Beast in the outward Court of that Temple. For they have the testimony of <a id="l76"></a>Jesus Apoc 12.17 &amp; are mystically killed for not worshipping the Image of the Beast ch. 13.15 &amp; <a id="l77"></a>in respect of the great harvest of martyrs (ch 14.15) are called the first fruits unto God (v.4) <a id="l78"></a>&amp; therefore they are Gods martyrs or witnesses.  They sing a new song with harps &amp; in that <a id="l79"></a>respect are Prophets: for singing  with musical instruments is prophesying 1 Chron 25. <a id="l80"></a>1, 2, 3. 2 King. 3.15. 1 Sam. 10.5.  They sing in the Priests court as  was described above &amp; stand as it were on the Sea of Glass <a id="l82"></a>which is in that Court. And in their mouth was found no lye Apoc 14.5 &amp; therefore they are true <a id="l83"></a>witnesses &amp; true prophets. And they that have the mark or name of the Beast are the inhabitants of the Earth and Sea to whom the Dragon came down in the outward court <a id="l84"></a>when he was cast out of heaven the upper Court in which the throne of God is placed. And <a id="l85"></a>as the 144000 prophesy with harps   the sacrifices of the seven Trumpets <a id="l86"></a>so it is to be conceied that the two witnesses also prophesy with harps at the same sacrifices. For <a id="l87"></a>they have power to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will, that is with the plagues <a id="l88"></a>of the seven Trumpets &amp; at the sacrifices to which those Trumpets sound they  prophesy <a id="l89"></a>with harps in the  voices of the seven thunders  uttered by the cloud wherewith the Son of <a id="l90"></a>Man is cloathed who in the forms of an Angel sets his right foot on the sea &amp; his left foot on the <a id="l91"></a><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>earth<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Earth<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>. For the two Witnesses are his two leggs &amp; his mystical body including that cloud. In <a id="l92"></a>the form of a Lamb with seven eyes &amp; seven horns he represents the seven Churches in the first Temple: in the <a id="l93"></a>form of the Son of Man with two eyes &amp; two leggs he represents the two chruches in the Second <a id="l94"></a>Temple: &amp; with the seven stars in his right hand he represents all the Churches in both Tem<a id="l95"></a>ples.</p>
        <p id="par12">(1)The first &amp; second temple are distinguished from one another in the number of their Candlesticks. <a id="l96"></a>In the first there are seven Candlesticks representing the seven Churches of Asia, in the second there are <a id="l97"></a>two Candlesticks representing the two Witnesses. (3)The first Temple is in the Kingdom of the Dragon the <a id="l98"></a>Second in the kingdom of the Beast. For the Beast makes war upon the two witnesses &amp; kills &amp; their dead <a id="l99"></a>bodies lye in the street of the great city. (2) The worshippers of God in the first Temple from the time of their <a id="l100"></a>sealing are called 144000 those in the second two witnesses. 4 In these things the two Temples disagree <a id="l101"></a>in other things they agree. For as they that worship God in the second Temple.</p>
        <p id="par13">Before the division of the Roman Empire the whole  was represented  by the Dragon <a id="l102"></a> &amp; the Chruch of the whole by the 12 tribes of Israel in the form of Woman in hte Taberna <a id="l103"></a>cle  or first Temple whose seven Candlesticks with their Lambs illuminating the whole Temple represent the seven Churches of Asia as the <a id="l104"></a>Metropolis  from whence the light of the Gospel went forth into the whole church of the primitive <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>beings<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>.. But <a id="l105"></a>when the Empire becomes divided into the Greek &amp; Latine Empires, that both Empires with <a id="l106"></a>their Churches fals &amp; true may be distinctly represented  a Beast with her <a id="l107"></a>horns rises out of the sea, another Beast with two horns rises out of the earth &amp; a <a id="l108"></a>new Temple is built with two Candlesticks. And hence forward the Eastern Empire with its <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003v"> &lt;3v&gt; </span>Churches fals &amp; true are represented by the Dragon <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span> the two horned Beast <a id="l109"></a>&amp; the 144000 <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span> worshipping  in the first Temple &amp; the  Latine Empire with its Churches fals &amp; true are represented by the  tenhorned Beast the Woman <a id="l110"></a>in the Wilderness &amp; the two witnesses worshipping   in the Second Temple ✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the top of f 4r &gt; </span>. &amp; in each Temple the people of God worship in the inner Court &amp; the Apostates in the Court without.</p>

And the worship in the inner Courts of <a id="l156"></a>both Temples is also alike, the worshippers being of one &amp; the same religion &amp; members <a id="l157"></a>of one &amp; the same mystical body of Christ.  As those in the  second Temple are called <a id="l158"></a>Witnesses &amp; Prophets so those in the first Temple are also Witnesses &amp; Prophets. For they have  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span><span class="hspac-n" title="2 lines space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the testimony of Jesus Apoc 12.17 &amp; are mystically killed for not worshipping the Image of the Beast (Ch 13. <a id="l159"></a>15) &amp; in respect of the great harvest of Martyrs (ch 14.15) are called the first fruits unto God (v.4) <a id="l160"></a>&amp; therefore they are  Martyrs or Witnesses. And they sing a new song with harps <a id="l161"></a>&amp; in that respect are Prophets. For singing with musical instruments is prophesying <a id="l162"></a>(1 Chron 25.1, 2, 3, 2 King. 3.15 1 Sam. 10.5) And wither mouth was found no <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>lye<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> (Apoc <a id="l163"></a>14.5) &amp; therefore they are true Witnesses &amp; true Prophets. And as these Prophets pro <a id="l164"></a>phesy in the inner court of the first Temple with harps &amp; singing at the sacrifices offered <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>in<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> that Temple.  so it is to be conceived <a id="l165"></a>that the two Witnesses prophesy in the inner court of the second Temple with harps &amp; sing<a id="l166"></a>ing at the sacrifices offered in this Temple. For they have power to smite the earth with all <a id="l167"></a>plagues as often as they will that is with the plagues of the seven wars represented by the sacri <a id="l168"></a>fices at which the seven Trumpets sound.,They consume their enemies with fire in the first war &amp; turning <a id="l169"></a>the waters into blood n the second: And therefore they prophesy all the time of those sacrifices. <a id="l170"></a>They are the two leggs of the earth as was said above. They are  his mystical body &amp; the cloud with which <a id="l171"></a>he is cloathed, &amp; their voice is the voice of that cloud uttering te seven Thunders, which, <a id="l172"></a>as was said, , are the song of the Temple sung by the Levits with harps &amp; other <a id="l173"></a>musical Instruments at the seven sacrifices while the Priests sound the seven Trumpets alternately &amp;  <a id="l174"></a>pour out the drink offerings called the seven vials of wrath.  And in respect of the <a id="l176"></a>seven stars in the right hand of the Son of Man, the 144000 may be also comprehended in his mystical body &amp; in the Cloud with which he is <a id="l177"></a>cloathed,  &amp; their voice of singing at the like sacrifices may be  comprehended in the voices of the seven thunders.  So then the worship in both Temples is one &amp; the <a id="l179"></a>same  &amp; has one &amp; the same signification. In each there are seven successive sacrifices synchro <a id="l180"></a>nal to one another  representing the slaughters to be made in the wars to which the seven Trumpets sound.</p>
        <p id="par17">But tho the two Witnesses prophesy during all the seven sacrifices; yet it is not <a id="l181"></a>to be conceived that they prophesy all this time in sackcloth.

Here's a continual subordination of witnesses. God gave it to Christ as the most <a id="l246"></a>worthy to receive it &amp; the fittest Witness to attest it. Christ gave to his Angel no doubt the most <a id="l247"></a>worthy to receive it from him &amp; the fittest witness to attest it to men.

Is not this the Angel who was sent with prophesies to Daniel, Zechar<a id="l250"></a>rias &amp; the Virgin Mary?
