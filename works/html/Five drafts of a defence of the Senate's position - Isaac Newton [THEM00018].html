<h2 id="hd1" class="left">The Answer to some Questions propounded by the Lord Chancellor at the Appearance <a id="l1"></a>of the Vice Chancellor &amp; Deputies of the Senate of the Vniversity of Cambridge before <a id="l2"></a> the Lords Commissioners May 7<sup>th</sup> 1687.</h2>
<p id="par1">To the Question what was the Vice Chancellors Oath of Office.  They say that the words of the <a id="l3"></a>Oath are these: Iurabis quod bene et fideliter præstabis omnia quæ spectant <a id="l4"></a>ad officium Procancellarij hujus Academiæ: Sic te Deus adjuvet &amp;c: which office <a id="l5"></a>being stated &amp; prescribed by the Laws of the Land &amp; Statutes of the Vniversity, the <a id="l6"></a>Vice Chancellor is thereby obliged to observe faithfully those laws so far as they respect <a id="l7"></a>his office: a part of which Statutes were those recited in the beginning of the <a id="l8"></a>Answer of the Vice Chancellor &amp; Senate formerly presented to your Lordships.  Further <a id="l9"></a>the said Oath we conceive to be as ancient as the office of Vicechancellourship, &amp; <a id="l10"></a>that the breaches thereof doe not onely make the Vice Chancellor forsworn but also affect the <a id="l11"></a>whole Senate.</p>
<p id="par2">To the Question: Have you never admitted persons to Degrees without <a id="l12"></a>taking the oaths.  They answer that they know not of any that have been so ad<a id="l13"></a>mitted, excepting onely such as by the custome of the Vniversity have been <a id="l14"></a>reputed Noblemen.  As to other persons who take Degrees of Learning to use, <a id="l15"></a>exercise, supply or occupy the same (as the statute words it) they represent that <a id="l16"></a>it has been the constant custome of the Vniversity to require the Oaths.  And for <a id="l17"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Lightfoot in whom your Lordship instanced they are fully satisfied that he <a id="l18"></a>did take the oaths by reason that he subscribed the three Articles in their common <a id="l19"></a>Register to which all persons taking the oaths do sett their hands, one of which Articles <a id="l20"></a>is the Kings supremacy, &amp; which subscription is all the Record they have &amp; conse<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>quently<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l21"></a>all the proofe that can be expected from them of any mans taking the said oaths, <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span> oaths themselvs being never recorded.  And yet in proofe of this matter they <a id="l22"></a>further alledge that D<sup>r</sup> Lightfoot took his Degree by the benefitt of the same <a id="l23"></a>Letters from which the aforesaid Perrera &amp; Stephens were upon their refusing <a id="l24"></a>to take the oaths excluded as appears by the records of the Vniversity.  And if <a id="l25"></a>any one shall represent (as they hear some do) that he took a Degree in his <a id="l26"></a>absence from the Vniversity &amp; consequently without taking the said oaths, <a id="l27"></a>they answer that he did it by Proxy under hand &amp; seale in which instrument he <a id="l28"></a>empowers his Proxy to take the oaths for him &amp; binds himself to abide by <a id="l29"></a>those oaths according to the practise of the civil Law.  And further if any <a id="l30"></a>one hath in any hurry of business or otherwise by oversight escaped taking <a id="l31"></a>them, they conceive it was a transgression of the law punishable in the persons <a id="l32"></a>offending &amp; can be no just precedent for any to transgress them wilfully <a id="l33"></a>&amp; thereby subject themselvs to the penalties <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>thereof.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> And they further <a id="l34"></a>say that they are fully &amp; particularly assured, that no person was ever admitted <a id="l35"></a>to a Degree who refused to take the oaths.</p>
<p id="par3">To the Questions, why the Senate interposed in this affair &amp; sent up <a id="l36"></a>Messengers to the Vice Chancellor.  They answer that the Kings Mandate being communi<a id="l37"></a>cated to the Senate according to its directions they conceived themselvs <a id="l38"></a>obliged by their oaths so to do, for (beside their oaths of Allegiance <a id="l39"></a>&amp; supremacy) all the Members of the Senate have obliged themselvs by <a id="l40"></a>their Matriculation Oath to save harmless the State, honour &amp; dignity of <a id="l41"></a>the Vniversity as long as they live; &amp; the same to defend by their vote <a id="l42"></a>&amp; counsel whether askt or not askt.  And further they represent that it <a id="l43"></a>is the natural right &amp; priviledge of <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>al Senates<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> that their members may <a id="l44"></a>consult &amp; advise one another concerning any business which comes before <a id="l45"></a>them, &amp; the onely way whereby the houses in Senate or any of their Members <a id="l46"></a>may consult the Vice Chancellor is by Messengers, it being indecent for him to go down <a id="l47"></a>to them, &amp; turbulent for any great Number of them to go up to him.  That <a id="l48"></a>it is very frequent for persons to go up from him to the houses to advise <a id="l49"></a>or consult him either in their own Names or in the names of many others <a id="l50"></a>or in the names of whole Colledges, &amp; by the same reason many or all the <a id="l51"></a>Colledges or Senate may consult him by one or more Messengers in any business <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> which concerns the whole.  That his late Majestie in a Letter to  the Vniversity <a id="l52"></a>dated December 15<sup>th</sup> 1669 enjoyned that none in the Regent house shall make <a id="l53"></a>any other addresse to the Vice Chancellor then by reverent &amp; respectfull application <a id="l54"></a>to him: whereby his said Majestie seems both to advise &amp; approve addresses <a id="l55"></a>of this nature; we humbly conceiving that the sence of both houses was <a id="l56"></a>communicated to the Vice Chancellor by their Messengers in the most modest quiett <a id="l57"></a>reverent &amp; respectfull manner that they could think of.  And the reason why <a id="l58"></a>these Messengers rather then others were chosen by the Senate was because <a id="l59"></a>of their being publick persons or Seniors of their houses.<br><br></p>
<p id="par4">They were influenced also by their religion established &amp; supported by the laws they are commanded to infringe.  Men of the Roman ffaith <a id="l60"></a>have been put into Masterships of Colleges.  The entrance into ffellowships <a id="l61"></a>is as  open.  And if forreigners be once incorporated <a id="l62"></a> twill be as open to them as others.  <a id="l63"></a>A mixture of Papist and Protestants  in the same Vniversity <a id="l64"></a>can neither  subsist happily nor long together.  And if the <a id="l65"></a>fountains once be dryed up the streams hitherto diffused thence throughout the <a id="l66"></a>Nation  must soon fall of.  Tis not their preferments  for a  time but their religi<a id="l67"></a>on &amp; Church which men of Conscience  <a id="l68"></a> are concerned for, &amp; if  it must  falll they implore this <a id="l69"></a>mercy that it may fall by the hands of others. </p>

<h2 id="hd2" class="left">The Answer to some Questions propounded by the Lord Chancellour at the <a id="l71"></a>appearance of the Vice-Chancellor &amp; Deputies of the Senate of the Vniversity <a id="l72"></a>of Cambridge before the Lords Commissioners May 7<sup>th</sup> 1687</h2>
<p id="par5">To the Question what was the Vice Chancellors oath of office.  They say that the words of the <a id="l73"></a>oath are these: Iurabis quod bene et fideliter præstabis omnia quæ spectant ad <a id="l74"></a>officium Procancellarij hujus Academiæ: Sic te Deus adjuvet &amp;c: which office being <a id="l75"></a>stated &amp; prescribed by the Laws of the Land &amp; Statutes of the Vniversity, the Vice Chancellor is <a id="l76"></a>thereby obliged to observe faithfully those laws so far as they respect his office: <a id="l77"></a>a part of which statutes were those recited in the beginning of the Answer of the <a id="l78"></a>Vice Chancellor &amp; Senate formerly presented to their Lordships.  Further the said oath <a id="l79"></a>they conceive to be as ancient as the office of Vice chancellourship, &amp; that the breaches <a id="l80"></a>thereof doe not onely make the Vice Chancellor forsworn but also affect the whole Senate.</p>
<p id="par6">To the Question, Did you ever know the Kings Mandate for Degrees declined <a id="l81"></a>before They answer always in this case where the oaths have been refused.  <a id="l82"></a>An instance of this was given in one Tatnel who was a non-conformist and <a id="l83"></a>upon certificate from the Vniversity that he refused to take the said oaths his <a id="l84"></a>late Majestie was pleased to recall his particular Mandate for conferring the <a id="l85"></a>Degree of D<sup>r</sup> of Divinity.  And they further say that M<sup>r.</sup> Pereira &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Stephens <a id="l86"></a>Servants to her Majesty the Queen Dowager &amp; Roman Catholicks, upon his <a id="l87"></a>late Majestys general Mandate for conferring Degrees on occasion of the <a id="l88"></a>Kings comming to the Vniversity had their graces passed by the Senate but <a id="l89"></a>upon their refusing to take these oaths were not admitted.</p>
<p id="par7">To the Question have you never admitted persons to Degrees without taking <a id="l90"></a>the oaths: They answer that they know not of any that have been so admitted, <a id="l91"></a>excepting onely such as by the Custome of the Vniversity have been reputed Noblemen.  <a id="l92"></a>As to other persons who take Degrees of Learning to use exercise supply or <a id="l93"></a>occupy the same (as the statute words it) they represent that it has been the constant <a id="l94"></a>custome of the Vniversity to require the oaths.  And for D<sup>r.</sup> Lightfoot in whom  his <a id="l95"></a>Lordship instanced they are fully satisfied that he did take the oaths by reason <a id="l96"></a>that he subscribed the three Articles in their common Register to which all persons <a id="l97"></a>taking the oaths do sett their hands, one of which Articles is the Kings supremacy, <a id="l98"></a>&amp; which subscription is all  the Record they have &amp; consequently all the proofe <a id="l99"></a>that can be expected from them of any mans taking the said oaths, the oaths them<a id="l100"></a>selvs being never recorded.  And yet in proofe of this Matter they further alledge <a id="l101"></a>that D<sup>r</sup> Lightfoot took his Degree by the benefitt of the same Letters from which the <a id="l102"></a>aforesaid Pereira &amp; Stephens were upon their refusing to take the oaths excluded <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003v"> &lt;3v&gt; </span> as appears by the Records of the Vniversity.  And if any one shall represent (as they hear <a id="l103"></a>some do) that he took a Degree in his absence from the Vniversity &amp; consequently <a id="l104"></a>without taking the said oaths, they answer that he did it by Proxy under hand &amp; <a id="l105"></a>Seale in which instrument he empowers his Proxy to take the oaths for him and <a id="l106"></a>binds himself to abide by those oaths, according to the practise of the civil Law.  <a id="l107"></a>And further if any one hath in any hurry of business or otherwise by oversight <a id="l108"></a>escaped taking them, they conceive it was a transgression of the Law punishable <a id="l109"></a>in the persons offending &amp; can be no just precedent for any to transgress them <a id="l110"></a>wilfully &amp; thereby subject themselvs to the penalties thereof. And they further <a id="l111"></a>say that they are fully &amp; particularly assured that no person was ever admitted to <a id="l112"></a>a Degree who refused to take the oaths.</p>
<p id="par8">To the Question why the Senate interposed in this affair &amp; sent up Messengers to the Vice Chancellor.  They answer that the Kings Mandate being communicated to <a id="l114"></a> the Senat according to its direction, the accepting the same would have passed <a id="l115"></a>for their act: especially since Degrees are not given by the Vice Chancellor without the <a id="l116"></a>Senate consisting of a certain number of persons at the least &amp; consenting <a id="l117"></a>either by vote or else by silence which in their proceedings usually passeth for an <a id="l118"></a>affirmative vote.  They conceived themselvs obliged by their oaths so to in<a id="l119"></a>terpose. For beside their oaths of Allegiance &amp; supremacy whereby they <a id="l120"></a>promise to renounce all forreigne Authority &amp; to their power assist and <a id="l121"></a>defend all authorities annexed to the Imperial Crowne of England and by <a id="l122"></a>consequence to oppose as far as they may lawfully the abettors of forreign <a id="l123"></a>authorities) they have obliged themselvs by their Matriculation Oath to preserve <a id="l124"></a>the priviledges of the Vniversity as much as in them lies, &amp; to save harmless the State ho<a id="l125"></a>nour &amp; dignity thereof as long as they live &amp; the same to defend by their <a id="l126"></a>vote &amp; counsell whether askt or not askt, &amp; other oaths to the same purpose are <a id="l127"></a>taken &amp; repeated by every graduate in his respective degree.  And even Noblemen <a id="l128"></a>themselvs who are excused from all other oaths do make faith to the same <a id="l129"></a>purpose in verbo honoris.  And further they represent that it is the natural right <a id="l130"></a>&amp; priviledge of all Senates that their members may consult &amp; advise one another <a id="l131"></a>concerning any business which comes before them, &amp; the onely way whereby the <a id="l132"></a>houses in Senate or any of their members may conveniently consult the Vice Chancellor is <a id="l133"></a>by Messengers it being indecent for him to go down to them, &amp; turbulent for <a id="l134"></a>any great Number of them to go up to him.

<h2 id="hd3" class="left">The Answer to some Questions propounded by the Lord chancellor at the <a id="l146"></a>appearance of the Vicechancellor &amp; Deputies of the Senate of the <a id="l147"></a>Vniversity of Cambridge before the Lords Commissioners May 7<sup>th</sup> 1687.</h2>
<p id="par9">To the Question what was the Vice Chancellors oath of office.  They say that the words of <a id="l148"></a>the oath are these: Iurabis quod bene et fideliter præstabis omnia quæ spec<a id="l149"></a>tant ad officium Procancellarij hujus Academiæ: sic te Deus adjuvet &amp;c: which <a id="l150"></a>office being stated &amp; prescribed by the Laws of the Land &amp; statutes of the Vniversity, <a id="l151"></a>the Vice Chancellor is thereby obliged to observe faithfully those laws so far as they res<a id="l152"></a>pect his office a part of which statutes were those recited in the beginning of <a id="l153"></a>the Answer of the Vice Chancellor &amp; Senate formerly presented to their Lordships.  Fur<a id="l154"></a>ther the said oath they conceive to be as ancient as the office of Vice Chancellourship <a id="l155"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp; that<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the breaches thereof doe not onely make the Vice Chancellor forsworn but also affect <a id="l156"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> whole Senate.</p>
<p id="par10">To the Question, Did you ever know the Kings Mandate for Degrees <a id="l157"></a>declined before. They answer always in this Case where the oaths have been <a id="l158"></a>refused.  An instance of this was given in one Tatnel who was a Non-<a id="l159"></a>conformist and upon certificate from the Vniversity that he refused to take the <a id="l160"></a>said oaths his <a id="l161"></a>late Majestie was pleased to recall his particular Mandate for <a id="l162"></a>conferring the Degree of D<sup>r</sup> of Divinity.  And they further say that M<sup>r.</sup> <a id="l163"></a>Pereira &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Stephens Servants to her Majesty the Queen Dowager &amp; Roman <a id="l164"></a>Catholicks, upon his <a id="l165"></a>late Majestys general Mandate for conferring  Degrees <a id="l166"></a>on occasion of the Kings coming to the Vniversity had their graces passed by the <a id="l167"></a>Senate but upon their refusing to take these Oaths were not admitted.</p>
<p id="par11">To the Question have you never admitted persons to Degrees without <a id="l168"></a>taking the Oaths. They answer that they know not of any that have been so <a id="l169"></a>admitted, excepting onely such as by the Custome of the Vniversity have <a id="l170"></a>been reputed Noblemen.  As to other persons who take Degrees of Learning <a id="l171"></a>to use exercise supply or occupy the same (as the Statute words it) they re<a id="l172"></a>present that it has been the constant <a id="l173"></a>Custome of the Vniversity to require the Oaths.  <a id="l174"></a>And for D<sup>r.</sup> Lightfoot in whom his Lordship instanced they are fully sa<a id="l175"></a>tisfied that he did take the oaths by reason that he subscribed the three Articles <a id="l176"></a>in their common Register to which all persons taking the oaths do sett their hands, <a id="l177"></a>one of which Articles is the Kings Supremacy, &amp; which subscription is all the Record <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005v"> &lt;5v&gt; </span> they have, &amp; consequently all the proofe that can be expected from them of <a id="l178"></a>any mans taking the said oaths, the oaths themselvs being never recorded.  <a id="l179"></a>And yet in proof of this Matter they further alledge that D<sup>r.</sup> Lightfoot <a id="l180"></a>took his Degree by the benefitt of the same Letters from which the aforesaid <a id="l181"></a>Pereira &amp; Stephens were upon their refusing to take the oaths excluded <a id="l182"></a>as appears by the records of the Vniversity.  And if any one shall represent <a id="l183"></a>(as they hear some do) that he took a Degree in his absence from the <a id="l184"></a>Vniversity &amp; consequently without taking the said oaths, they answer that he did <a id="l185"></a>it by Proxy under hand &amp; Seal, in which instrument he empowers his <a id="l186"></a>Proxy to take the oaths for him and binds himself to abide by those oaths, <a id="l187"></a>according to the practise of the civil Law.  And further if any one hath <a id="l188"></a>in any hurry of business or otherwise by oversight escaped taking them, <a id="l189"></a>they conceive it was a transgression of the Law punishable in the persons <a id="l190"></a>offending, &amp; can be no just precedent for any to transgress them wil<a id="l191"></a>fully &amp; thereby subject themselvs to the penalties thereof. And they <a id="l192"></a>further say that they are fully &amp; particularly assured that no person was <a id="l193"></a>ever admitted to a Degree who refused to take the oaths.</p>
<p id="par12">To the Question why the Senate interposed in this affair &amp; sent up <a id="l194"></a>Messengers to the Vice Chancellor.  They answer that the Kings Mandate being communicated <a id="l195"></a>to the Senate according to its direction, the accepting the same would <a id="l196"></a>have passed for their act: especially since Degrees are not given by <a id="l197"></a>the Vice Chancellor without the senate consisting of a certain number of persons <a id="l198"></a>at the least &amp; consenting either by vote or else by silence which in their <a id="l199"></a>proceedings usually passeth for an affirmative vote.  They conceived <a id="l200"></a>themselvs obliged <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>also<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> by their oaths to interpose. For besides their oaths <a id="l201"></a>of Allegiance &amp; supremacy whereby they promise to renounce all <a id="l202"></a>forreigne authoritie &amp; to their power to assist &amp; defend all authori<a id="l203"></a>ties annexed to the Imperial Crown of England and by consequence to <a id="l204"></a>oppose as far as they may lawfully the abettors of forreign Authorities) <a id="l205"></a>they have obliged themselvs by their Matriculation oath to preserve the <a id="l206"></a>priviledges of the Vniversity as much as in them lies, &amp; to save harmless <a id="l207"></a>the state honour &amp; dignity thereof as long as they live &amp; the same to defend <a id="l208"></a>by their vote &amp; counsel whether askt or not askt, &amp; other oaths to the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> same purpose are taken &amp; repeated by every Graduate in his respective <a id="l209"></a>Degree.  And even Noblemen themselvs who are excused from all other <a id="l210"></a>Oaths do make faith to the same purpose in verbo honoris.  And further <a id="l211"></a>they represent that it is the natural right &amp; priviledge of all Senates <a id="l212"></a>that their members may consult &amp; advise one another concerning any <a id="l213"></a>business which comes before them, &amp; the onely way whereby the houses in <a id="l214"></a>Senate or any of their members may conveniently consult the Vice Chancellor is <a id="l215"></a>by Messengers it being indecent for him to go down to them, &amp; turbulent <a id="l216"></a>for any great Number of them to go up to him.  That it is very frequent <a id="l217"></a>for persons to go up to him from the houses to advise or consult him either <a id="l218"></a>in their own Names or in the Names of whole Colledges, &amp; by the same <a id="l219"></a>reason many or all the Colledges or Senate may consult him by one <a id="l220"></a>or more Messengers in any business which concerns the whole.  That his <a id="l221"></a>late Majestie in a Letter to the Vniversity dated Decemb. 15<sup>th</sup> 1669 enjoyned <a id="l222"></a>that none in the regent house shall make any other address to the Vice Chancellor <a id="l223"></a>then by a reverent &amp; respectfull application to him: whereby his said <a id="l224"></a>Majestie seems both to advise &amp; to ap<a id="l225"></a>prove addresses of this nature; we <a id="l226"></a>humbly conceiving that the sence of both houses was communicated to <a id="l227"></a>the Vice Chancellor by their Messengers in the most modest quiet reverent &amp; <a id="l228"></a>respectfull manner that they could think of.  And the reason why these <a id="l229"></a>Messengers rather then others were chosen by the Senate was because <a id="l230"></a>of their being publick persons or Seniors of their houses.</p>

<h2 id="hd4" class="left">The Answer to some Questions propounded by the Lord Chancellor at the appearance of <a id="l231"></a>the Vicechancellor &amp; Deputies of the Senate of the Vniversity of Cambridge before the <a id="l232"></a>Lords Commissioners May 7<sup>th</sup> 1687</h2>
<p id="par13">To the Question what was the Vice Chancellors oath of office &amp; of what antiquity?.  They say, that the words of the oath <a id="l233"></a>are these: Iurabis quod bene et fideliter præstabis omnia quæ spectant ad officium <a id="l234"></a>Procancellarij hujus Academiæ: sic te Deus adjuvet: which office being stated &amp; <a id="l235"></a>prescribed by the Laws of the Land &amp; Statutes of the Vniversity, the Vice Chancellor is thereby obliged <a id="l236"></a>to observe faithfully those Laws, as far as they respect his office; a part of which <a id="l237"></a>laws were those recited in the beginning of the Answer of the Vice Chancellor &amp; Senate for<a id="l238"></a>merly presented to their Lordships.  Further the said oath they conceive to be as <a id="l239"></a>ancient as the office of Vice chancellorship, &amp; that the breaches thereof do not onely <a id="l240"></a>make the Vice Chancellor forsworn, but also affect the whole Senate: the honour &amp; dignity whereof <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>eac<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>h member is sworn to save harmless.</p>
<p id="par14">To the Question, Did you ever know the Kings Mandate for degrees declined before <a id="l241"></a>They answer; always in this case where the oaths have been refused.  An instance <a id="l242"></a>of this was given in one Tatnel, who was a non-conformist &amp; upon certificate <a id="l243"></a>from the Vniversity that he refused to take the said oaths his late Majestie was pleased to <a id="l244"></a>recall his particular Mandate for conferring the Degree of D<sup>r</sup> of Divinity.  <a id="l245"></a>And <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>they<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> further say, that M<sup>r.</sup> Pereira, &amp; M<sup>r.</sup> Stephens, Servants to her Majesty the <a id="l246"></a>Queen Dowager, &amp; Roman Catholicks, upon his late Majestys general Mandate <a id="l247"></a>for conferring Degrees on occasions of the Kings comming to the Vniversity had their <a id="l248"></a>graces passed by the Senate, but upon their refusing to take these oaths were <a id="l249"></a>not admitted.</p>
<p id="par15">To the Question, have you never admitted persons to Degrees without taking <a id="l250"></a>the Oaths? They answer, that they know not of any that have been so admitted, excepting <a id="l251"></a>onely Peers such as by the Custome of the Vniversity have been reputed Noblemen &amp; are thereupon excused.  As to other <a id="l252"></a>persons who take Degrees of Learning to use, exercise, supply, or occupy the same, <a id="l253"></a>(as the Statute words it) they represent that it has been the constant custome of the <a id="l254"></a>Vniversity to require the oaths.  And for D<sup>r.</sup> Lightfoot, in whom his Lordship instanced, <a id="l255"></a>they are fully  satisfied that he did take the oaths, by reason that he subscribed the <a id="l256"></a>three Articles in their common Register, to which all persons taking the oaths do sett <a id="l257"></a>their hands, one of which Articles is the King's supremacy, &amp; which subscription is all the <a id="l258"></a>Record they have, &amp; consequently all the proof that can be expected of any mans taking <a id="l259"></a>the said oaths, the oaths themselvs being never recorded.  And yet it is worthy of <a id="l260"></a>remark, that D<sup>r</sup> Lightfoot took his Degree by the benefitt of the same Letters from <a id="l261"></a>which the aforesaid Pereira, &amp; Stephens,  upon their refusing to take the oaths, were <a id="l262"></a>excluded; as appears by the records of the Vniversity.  And they hear that D<sup>r</sup> Balaam affirms <a id="l263"></a>that he, &amp; D<sup>r.</sup> Lightfoot had their hands on the book together in swearing.  And if it <a id="l264"></a>shall be represent (as they hear it is by some) that  some persons in thir absence from the <a id="l265"></a>Vniversity &amp; consequently without taking the said oaths  haue  been, admitted to  degrees; they <a id="l266"></a>answer, that they took them by Proxy under hand &amp; seale, in which instrument they empower <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007v"> &lt;7v&gt; </span> Proxys to perform the ceremony of swearing for them, and in animam suam; &amp; bind <a id="l267"></a>themselves to abide by those oaths, according to the practise of the civil Law,  conserved <a id="l268"></a>not only in the Vniversity but also in the Church of Rome, as well formerly in this <a id="l269"></a>Nation, as still in other Countries.  And further, if any one hath in any hurry <a id="l270"></a>of business, or otherwise, escaped taking them (an instance whereof will not <a id="l271"></a>easily be found) they conceive it was a transgression of the law punishable in <a id="l272"></a>the persons offending, &amp; can be no just precedent for any to transgresse them <a id="l273"></a>wilfully, &amp; thereby subject themselvs to the penalties thereof. And in general <a id="l274"></a>thus much may confidently be said, that no person was ever admitted to any Degree <a id="l275"></a>who refused to take the oaths: which is the true state of the present case.</p>
<p id="par16">To the Question, why the Senate interposed in this affair, &amp; sent up Messengers <a id="l276"></a>to the Vice Chancellor?  They answer, that the Kings Mandate being communicated to the Senate ac<a id="l277"></a>cording to its direction their not taking notice of the same would have made <a id="l278"></a>it seem to be accepted by them, &amp; so the admission of M<sup>r</sup> Francis to a degree to pass for the act of the Vniversity: especially since <a id="l279"></a>Degrees are not given by the Vice Chancellor without the Senate, consisting of a certain Number of persons (22 at the least) &amp; consenting either by vote or else by silence, <a id="l280"></a>which in their proceedings usually passeth for an affirmative vote . #<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 8r &gt; </span> # <a id="l282"></a>And  as the Mandate was directed to all &amp; consequently required obedience in them all, so the Lords Commissioners in their Summons advisedly accused the Vice Chancellor &amp; <a id="l283"></a>Senate together of disobedience &amp; the Vicechancellor &amp; Senate returned one common answer <a id="l284"></a>&amp; after hearing the Lord Chancellor reproved the Senate not for impertinent intermedling with what <a id="l285"></a>concerned them not, but for disobedience &amp; uneasiness under his Majesties commands, <a id="l286"></a>&amp; advised their obedience for the future. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 7v resumes &gt; </span>  They <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>conce<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ived <a id="l287"></a>themselvs obliged also by their oaths, to interpose. For by their oaths <a id="l288"></a>of Allegiance &amp; Supremacy  they  renounce all forreign <a id="l289"></a>Authority, &amp; promise to their power to assist, and defend all Iurisdictions &amp; Authorities annexed to the <a id="l290"></a>Imperial Crown of England &amp; by consequence to oppose as far as they may <a id="l291"></a>lawfully, the abettors of forreign <a id="l292"></a>authorities ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 8r &gt; </span> # which they could not be said to do at present, &amp; should disable themselves <a id="l293"></a>n great measure of doing for the future, if they should consent to the <a id="l294"></a>admission of such persons into their body, without insisting upon those <a id="l295"></a>oaths according to the trust reposed in the Vice Chancellour, &amp; Senate, <a id="l296"></a> for  defence of the  Crown against them.  <a id="l297"></a>And besides they have –<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 7v resumes &gt; </span> they have obliged themselvs <a id="l298"></a>by their Matriculation oath, to preserve the priviledges of the Vniversity as much <a id="l299"></a>as in them lies, &amp; to save harmless the state, honour, &amp; dignity thereof, as long <a id="l300"></a>as they live, &amp; the same to defend by their vote, &amp; counsel, whether askt, or <a id="l301"></a>not askt, &amp; other oaths to the same purpose are taken, &amp; repeated by every <a id="l302"></a>Graduate in his respective degree.  And even Noblemen themselvs, who are <a id="l303"></a>excused from all other oaths, do make faith to the same purpose in verbo <a id="l304"></a>honoris.   These are the reasons for the Senate's interposing, &amp; for the manner of their doing it they represent, that it is the natural right &amp; priviledge of <a id="l305"></a>all Senates, that their Members may consult &amp; advise one another, concerning <a id="l306"></a>any business that comes before them; &amp; the only way whereby the Houses in Senate, <a id="l307"></a>or any of their Members may conveniently consult the Vice Chancellor is by Messengers, it <a id="l308"></a>being indecent for him to go down to them, &amp; turbulent for any great num<a id="l309"></a>ber of them to go up to him, where it may be conveniently avoided.  That <a id="l310"></a>it is very frequent for persons to go up to him from the houses to advise or consult <a id="l311"></a>him, either in their own Names or in the Names of many others, or in the Names <a id="l312"></a>of whole Colledges, &amp; by the same reason,  all the Colledges, or Senate <a id="l313"></a>may consult him, by one or <a id="l314"></a>more Messengers, in any business which concerns the whole. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> 
That it would be a force upon the Senate to be required to be present at an act which <a id="l315"></a>cannot be done without them, &amp; to have the thing communicated to them, <a id="l316"></a>in order to its being done, &amp; yet, whilst they are averse from it, to be denyed <a id="l317"></a>all liberty of signifying their dissent.  That a Grace is not the proper way of <a id="l318"></a>the Senate's signifying their dissent from the Vice Chancellor in an illegal Act; for Graces <a id="l319"></a>are proposed by private persons to the Vice Chancellor to be communicated to the Senate, &amp; <a id="l320"></a>may be laid aside by him, or stop't by any one in the Head.  That the Members <a id="l321"></a>of the Senate may protest against the Vice Chancellors acting amongst them contrary to his <a id="l322"></a>duty, &amp; by consequence, may all of them severally request him to forbeare, <a id="l323"></a>&amp; therefore are not to be blamed for signifying their dissent in a more <a id="l324"></a>quiet &amp; modest way.  That the Order in his late Majestys Letter to the Vniversity Decemb. <a id="l325"></a>15<sup>th</sup>1669 against cursitation in the Senate, is to be understood of such needless, or <a id="l326"></a> indecent  actions as disturbe the  Senate; &amp; barrs not fit motion in business, as in Scrutinies, writing <a id="l327"></a>&amp; giving up votes, paying of mony to the Proctors, or other just occasions: and <a id="l328"></a>that one clause of the said order is, that none in the Regent house shall make any other <a id="l329"></a>address to the Vice Chancellor then by a reverent, &amp; respectfull application to him: whereby <a id="l330"></a>his said Majestie seems both to  approve &amp; advise addresses of this nature; they hum<a id="l331"></a>bly conceiving that the sence of both houses was communicated to the Vice Chancellor by <a id="l332"></a>their Messengers in the most modest, quiet, reverent, &amp; respectfull manner that <a id="l333"></a>they could think of.  For if in this Message there was any thing extraordinary <a id="l334"></a>'twas suitable to the occasion, &amp; not more extraordinary then protesting would <a id="l335"></a>have been which every one allows to be a lawfull act; &amp; which not onely implys a <a id="l336"></a>right of signifying their dissent, whether immediately, or by Messengers, but also <a id="l337"></a>recommands the same as fit, &amp; proper to be done, in the first place.  And the reason <a id="l338"></a>why these Messengers, rather then others were chosen by the Senate, was because of <a id="l339"></a>their being publick persons or Seniors of their houses.</p>

<p id="par17">To the Question, Did you ever know the Kings Mandate for Degrees declined <a id="l343"></a>before: They answer always in this case where the Oathes have been re<a id="l344"></a>fused.

<p id="par18">To the Question, Have you never admitted persons to Degrees without <a id="l352"></a>taking the Oaths.

They answer that the Kings Mandate being com<a id="l379"></a>municated to the Senate according to its direction they conceived themselvs <a id="l380"></a>obliged by their Oaths so to doe, for (besides their Oaths of Allegiance &amp; <a id="l381"></a>Supremacy) all the Members of the Senate have obliged themselvs by their <a id="l382"></a>Matriculation Oaths to preserve the privileges of the Vniversity as much as in them lies, &amp; to save harmless the State, honour &amp; dignity of the <a id="l383"></a>Vniversity as long as they live, &amp; the same to defend by their vote and <a id="l384"></a>Counsell whether askt or not askt. And further they represent that it is <a id="l385"></a>the naturall right &amp; priviledge of all Senates that their Members may con<a id="l386"></a>sult &amp; advise one another concerning any business which comes before them, <a id="l387"></a>&amp; the onely way whereby the houses in Senate or any of their Members may <a id="l388"></a>consult the Vicechancellor is by Messengers, it being indecent for him to goe <a id="l389"></a>down to them, &amp; turbulent for any great Number of them to go up to <a id="l390"></a>him.  That it is very frequent for persons to go up from him to the houses to <a id="l391"></a>advise or consult him either in their own Names or in the Names of many <a id="l392"></a>others or in the Names of whole Colledges, &amp; by the same reason many <a id="l393"></a>or all the Colledges or Senate may consult him by one or more Messengers <a id="l394"></a>in any business which concerns the whole.  That his late Majestie in a Letter to <a id="l395"></a>the Vniversity dated Decemb. 15<sup>th</sup> 1669 enjoyned that none in the Regent house <a id="l396"></a>shall make any other address to the Vice chancellor then by reverent &amp; respect<a id="l397"></a>full application to him: whereby his said Majestie seems both to advise &amp; <a id="l398"></a>approve addresses of this nature; we humbly conceiving that the sense of <a id="l399"></a>both houses was communicated to the Vice Chancellor by their Messengers in the most <a id="l400"></a>modest quiet reverent &amp; respectfull manner that they could think of.  And <a id="l401"></a>the reason why these Messengers rather then others were chosen by the Senate <a id="l402"></a>was because of their being publick persons or Seniors of their houses.</p>
