And therefore the first Temple continues in the <a id="l4"></a>kingdom of the Dragon. For when the Dragon has made war with <a id="l5"></a>the remnant of the womans seed which were left in his kingdom &amp; all <a id="l6"></a>are mystically killed who will not worship the Image of the Beast <a id="l7"></a>&amp; none are allowed to buy &amp; sell except those who receive the <a id="l8"></a>mark or name of the Beast &amp; all ave received his mark or name <a id="l9"></a>except the 144000 who are sealed with the seale or name of God in their <a id="l10"></a>foreheads: these 144000 being sealed in his kingdom where the <a id="l11"></a>rest are marked, sing a new song on mount Sion before the throne <a id="l12"></a>&amp; before the four Beasts &amp; the Elders, &amp; by consequence in the <a id="l13"></a>first Temple; &amp;  in the end there come Angels out of <a id="l14"></a>this Temple (Apoc. XIV. 3, 15, 17, 18.) and after the fall of Babylon the <a id="l15"></a>four &amp; twenty Elders &amp; four Beasts who were in the courts of this <a id="l16"></a>Temple, fall down &amp; worship God that sat upon the throne in this <a id="l17"></a>Temple, Apoc XIX. 4. And this Temple (not the second Temple but <a id="l18"></a>the Temple of the Tabernacle, that Temple which has the four Beasts <a id="l19"></a>in its outward court &amp; the 144000 standing upon its sea of glass) <a id="l20"></a>  is filled with <a id="l21"></a>smoke from the glory of God till the seven plagues of these Angels <a id="l22"></a>be fulfilled (Apoc. XV. 8) &amp; the seven Angels continue sounding <a id="l23"></a>the Trumpets &amp; pouring out the Vials to the end &amp; are the lamps <a id="l24"></a>of the seven Candlesticks of this Temple. And the seven Candlesticks <a id="l25"></a>also continue to the end: for the Churches of Pergamus, Sardis, <a id="l26"></a>Thyatria &amp; Philadelphia are four of the seven Candlesticks, &amp; <a id="l27"></a>the Church of Pergamus lasts till Christ comes &amp; fights against <a id="l28"></a>the Nicolaitans with the sword of his mouth, &amp; that of Sardis <a id="l29"></a>till Christ come as a thief, &amp; those of Thyatria &amp; Philadel<a id="l30"></a>phia are to hold fast what they have till Christ comes. So <a id="l31"></a>then the first Temple with it's throne &amp; seven Candlesticks <a id="l32"></a>&amp; Lamps &amp; 24 Elders &amp; four Beasts &amp; 144000 worshippers <a id="l33"></a>continues in the Dragon's kingdom to the end, &amp; a new Temple <a id="l34"></a> with two Candlesticks is built in the kingdom of the <a id="l35"></a>Beast. And by this means the Greek &amp; Latin Empires with <a id="l36"></a>their Churches false &amp; true are distinctly represented by the <a id="l37"></a>Dragon &amp; ten-horned Beast, the fals Prophet &amp; Whore &amp; the <a id="l38"></a>seven Candlesticks in the first Temple &amp; two Candlesticks in the <a id="l39"></a>second. For it was fit that all these things should be represented.</p>
        <p id="par2">But for understanding what is meant by the two candlesticks <a id="l40"></a>you are to remember that the nations in which the whole Church <a id="l41"></a>of Christ was seated, consisted of three parts, the eastern Empire <a id="l42"></a>the western Empire &amp; the northern nations of Europe. The first <a id="l43"></a>Temple before the division of the Empire, comprehended the whole. <a id="l44"></a>But after the division, it comprehended only the nations of the Greek <a id="l45"></a>Empire, amongst which I reccon Dacia; &amp; a new Temple was built <a id="l46"></a>for the saints of the western Empire &amp; of the northern nations <a id="l47"></a>who had received the gospel from them. And this Temple comprehending <a id="l48"></a>two of the three parts, it has in it two Candlesticks &amp; two Olive trees </p>
        <span class="pagenumber" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span><p id="par3" class="i0">because the Beast makes war upon the two Witnesses <a id="l49"></a>represented by the Candlesticks &amp; overcomes them &amp; kills <a id="l50"></a>them in the streets of the great city Babylon which in the <a id="l51"></a>form of a woman reigns over him. And therefore the first <a id="l52"></a>Temple continues in the kingdom of the Dragon. For the <a id="l53"></a>seven Candlesticks do not cease at the division of the Em<a id="l54"></a>pire but continue in the first Temple to the end of the <a id="l55"></a>Prophesy, the seven Angels which sound the Trumpets &amp; <a id="l56"></a>pour out the Vials being their lamps. This Temple (not <a id="l57"></a>the second Temple but the Temple of the Tabernacle) <a id="l58"></a>stands till the seven plagues of the seven Angels be <a id="l59"></a>fulfilled (Apoc. XV. 8) &amp; the four Beasts &amp; 24 Elders who were in <a id="l60"></a>the courts of this Temple fall down &amp; worship God that <a id="l61"></a>sat upon the throne between the Cherubims in this Temple (Apoc. <a id="l62"></a>XIX. 4.</p>

XI. 17.) The seven Candlesticks were applied literally to the Churches <a id="l66"></a>of particular cities, &amp; least you should apply the two Candlesticks to <a id="l67"></a>the Churches of two cities they are called also Olive trees, &amp; Olive <a id="l68"></a>trees are types of nations &amp; national churches (Ier. XI. 16. Rom. <a id="l69"></a>XI. 17.) They are also called two Witnesses &amp; by that name com<a id="l70"></a>prehend all the saints &amp; Martyrs who prophesy against the Beast <a id="l71"></a>&amp; Whore of Babylon &amp; with whose blood she is drunken, &amp; by con<a id="l72"></a>sequence extend into the northern nations.

And it was the mind of the Prophesy to make <a id="l81"></a>the Beast &amp; his Churches true &amp; false of one &amp; the same extent so <a id="l82"></a>that the two Witnesses might prophesy against the Beast &amp; Woman <a id="l83"></a>in all their dominions.</p><span class="hspac-n" title="1 line space left blank.">&nbsp;</span>

        <p id="par5">Iohn tells us that before the Beast ascended out of the <a id="l87"></a>abyss, five of the kings represented by his heads were fallen &amp; <a id="l88"></a>the sixt was in being. For before he ascended he was latent in the <a id="l89"></a>Dragons body &amp; therefore partakes of all his heads. For he was <a id="l90"></a>the water which the Dragon cast out of his mouth as a  flood <a id="l91"></a>after the Woman to cause her to be carried away of the flood. <a id="l92"></a>For waters are peoples &amp; nations &amp; multitudes &amp; tongues &amp; an <a id="l93"></a>aggregate of waters as a river a flood  or sea, is a body politi; <a id="l94"></a>or kingdom; &amp; the western Empire has a particular relation <a id="l95"></a>to the watry element, the Beast rising out of the sea &amp; the <a id="l96"></a>Woman sitting upon many waters. As the Woman was flying <a id="l97"></a>westward he cast this flood after her, &amp; therefore the flood <a id="l98"></a>is a western kingdom. She fled into the wilderness by a division <a id="l99"></a>of the Empire, &amp; the Dragon cast out of his mouth this flood after her to cause her to be carried away by it, &amp; there<a id="l100"></a>fore the casting of this flood out of his mouth signifies the <a id="l101"></a>division of the Empire by which she was carried away.</p>
        <p id="par6">The occasion of this division was the building of Constan<a id="l102"></a>tinople by Constantine the great A.C. 330, &amp; endowing it with <a id="l103"></a>a Senate &amp; privileges like those of Rome, &amp; making it the </p>

And therefore the sabbatic year began in the <a id="l181"></a>ninth year of Zedekiah in the seventh month three months <a id="l182"></a>before the siege of Ierusalem.

And <a id="l723"></a>accordingly from that time the plague abated. These things are  affirmed by Sigoni<a id="l724"></a>us who saith that he related them as they are  written in the Rituals of the Roman <a id="l725"></a>Church. And now by this miracle the invocation of the Virgin Mary with <a id="l726"></a>an Ora pro nobis by way of a solemn antiphony of the Church being brought into the Litany, the invocation of the Angels Apostles <a id="l727"></a>Martyrs &amp; other saints were of course inserted into the Antiphony – Ant this was the originall of the Litany <a id="l728"></a> now used in the Roman Church which is as follows.</p>

        <p id="par45">Before the Empire became Christian I meet with nothing <a id="l730"></a>in the Christian religion in favour of the Images or Pictures of <a id="l731"></a>dead men.

But in Italy the Bishops were less cautious if <a id="l741"></a>all be true which Pope Hadrian wrote to Charles the great. <a id="l742"></a>For in that letter he tells us that the Popes Silvester, Damacus, <a id="l743"></a>Cælestine, Leo &amp; Vigilius, who (by their deputies) were in the first five general Coun<a id="l744"></a>cils, &amp; several other Popes, as Marcus Iulius, Sixtus, Pelagius, Iohn <a id="l745"></a>&amp; Gregory the great, built &amp; painted Churches, Basilicas &amp; Marty<a id="l746"></a>ries both in mosaic work &amp; in histories with images in colours which <a id="l747"></a>remained till his days &amp; were  venerated by the people &amp; that <a id="l748"></a>Pope &amp; the Emperor Valentinian at the request of Sixtus placed <a id="l749"></a>statues of Gold in the Churches of Saint Mary &amp; Saint Peter at Rome which <a id="l750"></a>had been ever since venerated by all the faithful. And that Gregory <a id="l751"></a>the great  in his Monastery made a beautiful Oratory or Chappel painted <a id="l752"></a>with divers histories &amp; in it erected sacred Images &amp; he &amp; Saint Eleuthe<a id="l753"></a>rius who raised a dead man to life, prostrated themselves before the <a id="l754"></a>Images in prayer to God &amp; were heard,  &amp; the Images have been <a id="l755"></a>venerated ever since. And the same Gregory consecrated a church <a id="l756"></a>of the Arians with the reliques of saints &amp; after a miracle done in it caused it to be painted <a id="l757"></a>with various histories both in mosaic &amp; in colours, &amp; erected vene<a id="l758"></a>rable images in it which have ever since been venerated. And, <a id="l759"></a>saith Hadrian, the time would fail me to tell in order how <a id="l760"></a>many churches the Popes our predecessors have made erecting holy <a id="l761"></a>images in the &amp; painting  divers histories &amp; venerating <a id="l762"></a> what was erected or painted.</p>

Sam. 1037, <a id="l991"></a>&amp; the kingdom of Iudea An. Sam. 1038, &amp; the kingdom <a id="l992"></a>of Egypt An. Sam. 1071, &amp; by conquering those three <a id="l993"></a>kingdoms it stood up &amp; became exceeding great towards <a id="l994"></a>the south &amp; towards the east &amp; towards the pleasant <a id="l995"></a>land, but not by its own power. And by growing great towards the pleasant land &amp; conquering Iudea the <a id="l996"></a>people of God, it grew up also to the host of <a id="l997"></a>heaven &amp;  cast down some of the host &amp; of the starrs to <a id="l998"></a>the grownd. Then it magnified it self to the Prince of <a id="l999"></a>the host &amp; took away the daily worship. But for under<a id="l1000"></a>standing these things its necessary to compare this vision <a id="l1001"></a>of the Ram &amp; Goat with the Prophesy of the Scripture of <a id="l1002"></a>truth. For they both concern the  nations of the Greek <a id="l1003"></a>Empire reigning sometimes by their own power &amp; sometimes by the <a id="l1004"></a>power of others  till the end of the four Empire, <a id="l1005"></a>&amp; the latter is a commentary upon the  former.</p>
        <p id="par64">In the prophesy of the scripture of truth Daniel <a id="l1006"></a>tells us how the first Kingdom of the Greeks represented <a id="l1007"></a>by the first horn of the Goat brake into four great <a id="l1008"></a>kingdoms seated to the four winds of heaven, &amp; then describes <a id="l1009"></a>the history of the kings or kingdoms of the north &amp; south <a id="l1010"></a>which are two of the four &amp;  prosecutes the de<a id="l1011"></a>scription down to the eighth year of Antiochus Epi<a id="l1012"></a>phanes, the year in which the kingdom of Macedon fell, <a id="l1013"></a>&amp; there he breaks off &amp; passes from describing the kingdom of the four horns to describe that of the <a id="l1014"></a>little horn of the Goat or king of fierce counte<a id="l1015"></a>nance in these words, <em class="underline">And arms out of him shall <a id="l1016"></a>stand up</em>. <em class="underline">Arms</em> are every where in this prophesy <a id="l1017"></a>put for the military force of a kingdom; <em class="underline">out of him</em> is out of the people of his kingdom &amp; <em class="underline">standing <a id="l1018"></a>up</em> signifies making war &amp; growing great &amp; powerfull <a id="l1019"></a>by conquest; &amp; here it signifies standing up over the <a id="l1020"></a>kingdoms of the north &amp; south of which Daniel had been <a id="l1021"></a>hitherto speaking. Arms shall stand up &amp; a king of <a id="l1022"></a>fierce countenance shall stand up are expressions of the 
        <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span>same signification.

These arms grew out of the people of the king of the north <a id="l1028"></a>by conquest. These arms grew out of the people of the king of the north <a id="l1029"></a>by conquest, till they became a little horn, &amp; this horn was still to grow <a id="l1030"></a>out of the remainder of the people of that king by conquest &amp; thereby was great &amp; <a id="l1031"></a> by carrying on his conquests also into Egypt wax exceeding great.</p>

        <p id="par71">Thus Daniel in this prophesy of the scripture of truth <a id="l1132"></a>hath described by steps the chief actions &amp; revolutions within <a id="l1133"></a>the compass of the Greek Empire in all ages from the reign 
                    <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021r"> &lt;21r&gt; </span> of Alexander the great to the resurrection of the dead. And in <a id="l1134"></a>doing this he hath distinguished the times into three of four cor<a id="l1135"></a>dinal periods. The first is of the reign of the Greeks untill the <a id="l1136"></a>Romans began to conquer them. The second is of the Romans over <a id="l1137"></a>the Greeks untill the division of their Empire into the Empires of the <a id="l1138"></a>Greeks &amp; Latines. The third is of the Greek Empire at Constantinople <a id="l1139"></a>after separation from the Latines untill the rise &amp; reign of the <a id="l1140"></a>Mahometans. And the fourth is of the Mahometans making war <a id="l1141"></a>upon the Greeks &amp; reigning successively in the south &amp; north. <a id="l1142"></a>And these periods are distinguished from one another by saying in the <a id="l1143"></a>beginning of the second, &amp; again in the beginning of the third, that <a id="l1144"></a>the end is  yet for a time appointed &amp; calling the fourth the <a id="l1145"></a>time of the end. In the first period the transgressors came to <a id="l1146"></a>the full. The second began with their practices against the daily <a id="l1147"></a>worship of the Iews; The third with the rise &amp; reign of the <a id="l1148"></a>religion of the Moncks: &amp; the fourth with the rise &amp; reign <a id="l1149"></a>of the religion of the Mahometans. In the end of the first <a id="l1150"></a>period Iason the High Priest with certain of the Iews having <a id="l1151"></a>obteined licence from the king to do after the ordinances of the <a id="l1152"></a>heathens &amp; they made themselves uncircumcised &amp; forsook <a id="l1153"></a>the holy covenant &amp; joyned themselves to the heathen (1 Mac. <a id="l1154"></a>I. II &amp; 2 Mac. 4. 9, 12:)  In the  beginning of the second <a id="l1155"></a>the abomination of the heathens was set up by Antiochus <a id="l1156"></a>Epiphanes in all Iudæa &amp; it was afterwards endeavoured to be set <a id="l1157"></a>up by the persecutions of the heathen Roman Emperors among <a id="l1158"></a>the Christians. In the third the abomination of the Moncks <a id="l1159"></a>of invoking the dead, which is a breach of the first command<a id="l1160"></a>ment, was set up in all the empires. In the fourth the <a id="l1161"></a>Monckish abomination of worshipping pictures or images, <a id="l1162"></a>which is a breach of the second commandment, was set up <a id="l1163"></a>in all the Empire: And these abominations made a desolati<a id="l1164"></a>on continued all the time of the end untill the cleansing <a id="l1165"></a>of the sanctuary.</p>
        
        <p id="par73">In the end of the first period it is said: <em class="underline">And both these kings <a id="l1174"></a>hearts shall be to do mischief &amp; they shall speak lyes at one <a id="l1175"></a>table</em> [against the holy covenant;] <em class="underline">but it shall not prosper: for <a id="l1176"></a>yet the end shall be at the time appointed</em>. And the second <a id="l1177"></a>period begins with these words: <em class="underline">Then shall be return into <a id="l1178"></a>his land with great riches &amp; his heart shall be against the <a id="l1179"></a>holy covenant: &amp; he shall act</em> [against it,] <em class="underline">but it shall not <a id="l1180"></a>prosper, for the end is not yet</em>. All this was in autumn in the <a id="l1181"></a>year of Seleucus 143, when Antiochus Epiphanes in returning <a id="l1182"></a>out of Egypt into Syria sackt Ierusalem, slew many of the <a id="l1183"></a>people, spoiled the Temple, took away the golden Altar &amp; the <a id="l1184"></a>Candlestick &amp; the Table of shew bread &amp; the Vail, &amp; all the Vialls <a id="l1185"></a>the vessels &amp; treasures of the Temple, &amp; thereby made the daily <a id="l1186"></a>worship begin to cease. This was in the middle of the war of 
        <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022r"> &lt;22r&gt; </span> the Romans against the kingdom of Macedon, &amp; after two <a id="l1187"></a>years more, when that kingdom was newly conquered, – <a id="l1188"></a>Antiochus upon his second return out of Egypt caused the Altar <a id="l1189"></a>to be polluted &amp; idol-altars &amp; groves &amp; chappels of Idols <a id="l1190"></a>to be set up throughout all the cities of Iudea &amp;  <a id="l1191"></a>ordeined that all men should forsake the law &amp; follow <a id="l1192"></a>the customes of the heathens 1 Macc. I. 42, 47, 50, 54. And all this <a id="l1193"></a>was done by the suggestion of Ptolomy king of Egypt as above <a id="l1194"></a>2 Macc. 6. 8. This was the first act of taking away the <a id="l1195"></a>daily sacrifice &amp; setting up the abomination of desolation: &amp; <a id="l1196"></a>the last act was in the beginning of the year of Christ 842 &amp; end of the <a id="l1197"></a>year of Seleucus 1153, when a Council called at Constan<a id="l1198"></a>tinople by the Empress Theodora &amp; her son Michael <a id="l1199"></a>decreed that Images which had been condemned &amp; thrown <a id="l1200"></a>down by several former Emperors should be set up <a id="l1201"></a>again &amp; venerated as before; &amp; a festival was instituted <a id="l1202"></a>to be kept annually on Feb. II in memory of their <a id="l1203"></a>restitution. And it is observable that the difference be<a id="l1204"></a>tween these two periods being 1010 Iudaic years is the same <a id="l1205"></a>with the difference between the 2300 &amp; the 1290 days, <a id="l1206"></a>putting a prophetick day for a Iudaic year. But these <a id="l1207"></a>numbers admit of several interpretations &amp; it must be left <a id="l1208"></a>to time to discover the truth.</p>
        <p id="par74">And its further observable that Daniel describes the last <a id="l1209"></a>end of all these things by three steps or successive events. The <a id="l1210"></a>first event is the fall of the last horn of the fourth Beast <a id="l1211"></a>in the end of <em class="underline">a time times &amp; half a time</em>. The second event <a id="l1212"></a>is the return of the Iewish captivity &amp; cleansing of the <a id="l1213"></a>sanctuary  when <a id="l1214"></a>God <em class="underline">shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy <a id="l1215"></a>people</em>. The third event is the commencing of the kingdom of <a id="l1216"></a>God &amp; Christ over the nations of the four Monarchs by the <a id="l1217"></a>victory of Michael at the end of the great tribulation: at <a id="l1218"></a>which time the people of Daniel was many as are found written <a id="l1219"></a>in the book are delivered thereby &amp; many that sleep in the dust <a id="l1220"></a>awake &amp; Daniel stands in his lot among them. And these three <a id="l1221"></a>successive events are described by Daniel in this manner.</p>
        <p id="par75">1 <em class="underline">And one said to the man cloathed in linnen who <a id="l1222"></a>was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it <a id="l1223"></a>be to the end of these wonder? And I heard the man <a id="l1224"></a>cloathed in linnen who was upon the waters of the river <a id="l1225"></a>when he lift up his right hand &amp; his left hand unto</em> – <a id="l1226"></a>heaven &amp; sware by him that liveth for ever &amp; ever, <a id="l1227"></a>that it shall be for a time times &amp; an half.</p>
        <p id="par76">2 <em class="underline">And</em> [after that] <em class="underline">when he shall have</em> [further] <a id="l1228"></a><em class="underline">accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people <a id="l1229"></a>all these things shall be finished. And I heard but I <a id="l1230"></a>understood not. Then I said I, O my Lord what shall be <a id="l1231"></a>the end of these things</em> [when he shall have accomplished <a id="l1232"></a>to scatter the power of the holy people &amp; all these things <a id="l1233"></a>shall be  finished?] <em class="underline">And he said – From the time that <a id="l1234"></a>the daily sacrifice shall be taken away &amp; the abomination <a id="l1235"></a>that maket desolate be set up</em> [untill he shall have <a id="l1236"></a>accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people] <em class="underline">three <a id="l1237"></a>shall be a thousand two hundred &amp; ninety days</em></p>
        <p id="par77">3. <em class="underline">Blessed is he that waiteth &amp; cometh to the thousand <a id="l1238"></a>three hundred &amp; give &amp; thirty days</em> [at which time all these

        <p id="par78">At the first period, times &amp; laws cease to be given into the <a id="l1241"></a>hands of the little horn of the fourth Beast, &amp; many begin <a id="l1242"></a>to run to &amp; fro &amp; knowledge to be encreased &amp; the gospel to <a id="l1243"></a>be preached in all nations by the two Witnesses ascending up to <a id="l1244"></a>heaven in a cloud.</p>
        <p id="par79">At the second period the Sanctuary is cleansed from the <a id="l1245"></a>abomination of desolation which had been set up by the little <a id="l1246"></a>horn of the He-goat.</p>
        <p id="par80">At the third period that horn reigning in the power of <a id="l1247"></a>the king of the north plants the palace of his tabernacle <a id="l1248"></a>between the seas in the glorious holy mountain &amp; comes to <a id="l1249"></a>his end by the hand of Michael the great Prince who is set <a id="l1250"></a>over the children of Daniels people, &amp; the Dragon being <a id="l1251"></a>overcome by Michael is taken &amp; shut up in the bottom<a id="l1252"></a>less pit, &amp; the great tribulation ceases &amp; Daniels people are <a id="l1253"></a>delivered  as many as are found written in the book <a id="l1254"></a>&amp; many that sleep in the dust awake, &amp; the world being <a id="l1255"></a>now at an end the Messiah the Prince comes to judge the <a id="l1256"></a>quick &amp; the dead, &amp; the great Iubilee is celebrated at his <a id="l1257"></a>coming in the end of the seven weeks.</p>

        <p id="par83">In the days of the Patriarchs almost every city had its <a id="l1353"></a>king.

        <p id="par84">When Christ reigned over Israel in the wilderness &amp; in <a id="l1363"></a>the days of the Iudges, he had  a kingdom of Angels &amp; by their ministry governed his people below: &amp; built in <a id="l1364"></a>like manner when he comes to judgement he comes with a <a id="l1365"></a>kingdom composed of an innumerable company of Angels; &amp; <a id="l1366"></a>the saints who rise from the dead are added to this kingdom. <a id="l1367"></a>For they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as <a id="l1368"></a>the Angels in heaven. At his coming the saints rise out of the <a id="l1369"></a>dust with bodies celestial &amp; he shall send his Angels &amp; they shall gather the elect <a id="l1370"></a>from the four winds of heaven &amp; the dead in Christ shall rise <a id="l1371"></a>first &amp; they that are alive shall be caught up together with <a id="l1372"></a>them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air &amp; so shall they ever be with the Lord 1 Thess IV. 16, 17 Matt. XVII. 31, 40. <a id="l1373"></a>Luke XVII. 34, 37. These reign with Christ &amp; with the blessed Angels <a id="l1374"></a>in heaven a thousand years before the rest of the dead are raised: for judg<a id="l1375"></a>ment begins at the house of God. And when these are judged they <a id="l1376"></a>assist in judging the rest of the dead &amp; also in judging the fallen Angels, 1 Cor. VI. <a id="l1377"></a>2, 3. Matt. XIX. 28. At his coming he shall also send forth his Angels <a id="l1378"></a>&amp; they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend <a id="l1379"></a>&amp; them which do iniquity, &amp; then shall the righteous shine forth <a id="l1380"></a>as the Sun in the kingdom of their father &amp; as the starrs for ever &amp; ever. Matt. XIII. 41, 43 &amp; Dan XII. 3. Thus <a id="l1381"></a>he shall judge the quick &amp; the dead at his coming &amp; his kingdom, <a id="l1382"></a> <a id="l1383"></a>mouth ,  rewarding the saints with a crown of <a id="l1386"></a>life in heaven &amp; with power over the nations on earth, &amp; <a id="l1387"></a>smiting the nations  by the word of his mouth as with a two-<a id="l1388"></a>edged sword &amp; ruling them by an army of Angels as with a rod <a id="l1389"></a>of iron.

This was in the year 365 ten years <a id="l1433"></a>after the Council of Millain. For the emperor resided <a id="l1434"></a>that year at Millain till the month of September.

        <p id="par94">① The Council of Constantinople A.C. 360 had for <a id="l1481"></a>various crimes deposed Macedonius bishop of Constantinople, <a id="l1482"></a>Eustathius bishop of Sebastia, Eleusius bishop of Cyzicum, So <a id="l1483"></a>phronius bishop of Pompeiopolis, Cyril bishop of Ierusalem &amp; <a id="l1484"></a>some others: &amp; soon after Macedonius who had hitherto <a id="l1485"></a>been against the Nicene decree declared for it in the sense <a id="l1486"></a>of the word ὁμοιούσιος &amp; had many followers, this being <a id="l1487"></a>the sense in which the Greek Church had understood the <a id="l1488"></a>Nicene faith. For the Macedonians represented that the <a id="l1489"></a>western Churches took the homousion in a vitious sense <sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup>, &amp; that <a id="l1491"></a>Ætius in the east coining a new language introduced τὸ κατ' <a id="l1492"></a>ὸὐσίαν ἀνόμοιον unlike according to substance, &amp; that both <a id="l1493"></a>opinions were wicked. For, say they, these [the western Churches]  rashly connected the distinct hypostases of the father <a id="l1495"></a>&amp; son into unity binding them together with the word ὀμο<a id="l1496"></a>ούσιος as with a bond of iniquity: but he [Ætius] wholy dis<a id="l1497"></a>joyned the conjection of the nature of the son with that <a id="l1498"></a>of the father by introducing the name of unlike according <a id="l1499"></a>to substance. Seing therefore the two opinions run into two <a id="l1500"></a>extremes, we have accounted the middle way between both <a id="l1501"></a>agreable to truth &amp; piety, namely that the son is like the <a id="l1502"></a>father  κατ' ὑπόστασιν according to <a id="l1503"></a>substance. In this manner the Macedonians defended the <a id="l1504"></a>Nicene faith &amp; in the reign of Iovian some of them with the <a id="l1505"></a>Acacians &amp; Meletius one of the bishops of Antioch met in a <a id="l1506"></a>Council at Antioch &amp; presented this their faith to the Emperor <a id="l1507"></a>Iovian as we told you above. And in the two or three years <a id="l1508"></a>following  for reestablishing the Council of Nice the Macedonians met <a id="l1509"></a>in several Councils  in Pamphylia &amp; Isauria &amp; Lycia &amp; <a id="l1510"></a>at Smyrna &amp; Lampsacum. And when the new Emperor <a id="l1511"></a>Valens, going eastward, had in his stay at Constantinople  been pre<a id="l1512"></a>possessed against the homousion by Eudoxus bishop of that city, &amp; came to Heraclea <a id="l1513"></a>in Bithynia, which was in August or September A.C. 365, some <a id="l1514"></a>from the Council of Lampsacum applied to him with <a id="l1515"></a>their faith &amp; were rejected &amp; thereupon the Council resolved to send Legates <a id="l1516"></a>to the western Emperor Valentinian &amp; the Bishops of Rome &amp; the west. <a id="l1517"></a></p>

        <p id="par101">In the time of the sixt reign of head when the Beast had <a id="l1537"></a>been &amp; was not &amp; was to ascend out of the abyss the ten <a id="l1538"></a>kings had received no kingdom  but were to receive <a id="l1539"></a>power as kings at one &amp; the same hour with the Beast <a id="l1540"></a>This Beast received the Dragon's throne at the death of Theodo<a id="l1541"></a>sius A.C. 395 Ian 13 &amp; therefore the ten horns were now to receive power as kings &amp; accordingly the western Empire began presently to break into ten kingdoms. The Visigoths under the conduct of Alaric rose from their seats in Thrace &amp; made war upon the Empire presently after the death of Theodosius &amp; at length seated themselves in Gallia &amp; Spain. The same year the Hunns Alans &amp; Vandals rose up in arms &amp; began to make war upon the Empire, &amp; so did the Suevians the same year or soon after. When they took up arms they received power as kings. The The Vandals the Alans in two bodies &amp; the Suevians leaving Pannonia to the Hunns marched to the Burgundians upon the Rhene, joyned them, passed the Rhene at Ments, invaded Gallia, put the Salian Francks into motion &amp; gave occasion to the revolt of the Britains &amp; after some wars seated themselves in various parts of France &amp; Spain. And these nine kingdoms with the remainder of the western Empire received power as kings most of them upon the death of Theodosius &amp; the rest within 12 or 13 years after his death, the Empire braking into these ten kingdoms by one continued series of war which began at the sounding of the  first Trumpet, &amp; shifted from east to west at the sounding of the second &amp;  completed the division of the western ✝✝ Empire into the ten kingdoms represented by  rivers &amp; fountains of water at the sounding of the third be<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>ch<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> explained above. As the Leopard which rose out of the sea with four heads &amp; four wings represents the –––––– wings represents the Greek Empire which was first monarchical <a id="l1550"></a>&amp; then brake into four great kingdoms so the Beast which rose <a id="l1551"></a>out of the sea with ten horns represents the western empire <a id="l1552"></a>first in a monarchical form &amp; soon after divided into ten <a id="l1553"></a>kingdoms. And as the four heads &amp; wings of the Leopard &amp; <a id="l1554"></a>four horns of the He-Goat constantly represent the kingdoms into which <a id="l1555"></a>the Greek Empire was divided whether more or fewer then <a id="l1556"></a>four, the number four respecting only the first division: <a id="l1557"></a>so the ten horns constantly represent the kingdoms into which the Latine <a id="l1558"></a>empire is at any time divided be they more or fewer then <a id="l1559"></a>ten, the number &amp; the rooting up of three of them they are <a id="l1560"></a>ever after called the ten horns &amp; the seven heads. And because <a id="l1561"></a>the heads in this sense are the seven mountains where the Woman <a id="l1562"></a>sitteth &amp; mountains are kingdoms, it is to be conceived that her fa<a id="l1563"></a>mous reign represented by her sitting there begins not till the <a id="l1564"></a>three horns are rooted up those three which stood in <a id="l1565"></a>her way &amp; reigned over the rest. The ten horns are said to receive <a id="l1566"></a>power as kings the same hour with the Beast to signify either that <a id="l1567"></a>the interval was very short, of that when they received power as <a id="l1568"></a>kings he also received power together with them as one of the ten <a id="l1569"></a>which he did by deserting Rome &amp; making Ravenna the seat of his <a id="l1570"></a>kingdom. For at that time they horns were all risen. They became of one mind that is of one religion, &amp; by unit<a id="l1571"></a>ing in religion &amp; submitting to the Woman's ecclesiastical authority they agreed <a id="l1572"></a>&amp; gave their kingdom to compose her Beast.</p>
        
        <p id="par103">Some have recconed the Greek Empire amongst the <a id="l1574"></a>horns of the Beast. For as the ten horns are ten kings which agree <a id="l1575"></a>&amp; give their  power &amp; strength to the Beast <a id="l1576"></a>so the Dragon gave the Beast his power &amp; throne &amp; all the world wondred after the Beast <a id="l1577"></a>&amp; power was given to the Beast over all kindreds &amp; tongues &amp; 
        <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p031v"> &lt;31v&gt; </span>nations &amp; all that dwell on the earth worshipped him whose names <a id="l1578"></a>were not written in the book of life. But its to be observed that <a id="l1579"></a>after it was said that all the world wondered after him, it is added <a id="l1580"></a>in the next words that <em class="underline">they worshipped the Dragon which gave <a id="l1581"></a>power to the Beast &amp; they worshipped the Beast saying, Who is <a id="l1582"></a>like unto the Beast? Who is able to make war with him?</em> For <a id="l1583"></a>by these words the Dragon &amp; Beast or Greek &amp; Latin Empire <a id="l1584"></a>are still distinguished &amp; considered apart &amp; the Greek Empire is still considered <a id="l1585"></a>as the Dragon. Yet the power of the Beast became universal in <a id="l1586"></a>respect of his worship. For after his death &amp; resurrection <a id="l1587"></a> the two horned Beast became his Priest, con<a id="l1588"></a>secrated him a God &amp; caused the eastern nations to erect an <a id="l1589"></a>image to him &amp; to worship him &amp; his image, &amp; wonder after him, <a id="l1590"></a>but gave him no temporal dominion over them.</p>

Thou shalt have <a id="l1668"></a>no other Gods in my sight, neither shalt thou make <a id="l1669"></a>to thy self any graven image.

For the ten commandments are practical &amp; <a id="l1676"></a>respect the worship &amp; morals of the Iews. We are <a id="l1677"></a>not forbidden to give the name of Gods to Angels <a id="l1678"></a>&amp; kings but we are forbidden to worship them as <a id="l1679"></a>Gods. We are forbidden to worship them not only as <a id="l1680"></a>supreme infinite eternal &amp; omnipotent Gods, but even <a id="l1681"></a>as inferior &amp; subordinate Gods. We are forbidden <a id="l1682"></a>to worship them in such a sense as the heathens <a id="l1683"></a>worshipped their Gods, who took them for nothing <a id="l1684"></a>more then the souls of dead men, mediators between <a id="l1685"></a>God &amp; man, Lords who reigned over us under the <a id="l1686"></a>supreme God. For to us in our worship there is but <a id="l1687"></a>one God the father almighty &amp; one mediator between <a id="l1688"></a>God &amp; man the man Christ Iesus; one God &amp; one Lord; <a id="l1689"></a>one God to whom we are to give honour &amp; glory <a id="l1690"></a>&amp; praise &amp; thanks &amp; worship for creating all things <a id="l1691"></a>&amp; preserving us &amp; giving us our daily bread &amp; to – <a id="l1692"></a>direct our prayers for what we want, &amp; one Lord &amp; <a id="l1693"></a>Mediator to whom we are to give honour &amp; glory &amp; <a id="l1694"></a>thanks for redeeming us with his blood, &amp; in whose <a id="l1695"></a>name we are to direct all our prayers to God.

The first part is moral, &amp; the second <a id="l1702"></a>is only ceremonial. The first part was performed in <a id="l1703"></a>all the synagogues, the second was performed only in the <a id="l1704"></a>temple: And where the daily worship was performed <a id="l1705"></a>there was the sanctuary of strength.

              <span class="pagenumber" id="p035r"> &lt;35r&gt; </span><p id="par112">For understanding Daniels' descriptions of the princi<a id="l1723"></a>pal Monarchies &amp; Kingdoms which  were to flourish after his <a id="l1724"></a>days, it is to be observed that all Daniels' Beasts continue <a id="l1725"></a>in being to the end. For he tells us that the three first Beasts <a id="l1726"></a>had their dominions taken away, but their lives were pro<a id="l1727"></a>longed for a season &amp; time, that is, untill the judgement <a id="l1728"></a>should sit, &amp; the greatness of the dominion under the whole <a id="l1729"></a>heaven should be given to the people of the saints of the <a id="l1730"></a>most High. For then the stone cut out of the mountain <a id="l1731"></a>without hands should smite the image upon its feet &amp; break <a id="l1732"></a>in pieces the iron, the brass, the silver &amp; the gold respre<a id="l1733"></a>senting the four monarchies, &amp; grow into a great mountain <a id="l1734"></a>filling the earth with its dominion. The four Beasts <a id="l1735"></a>are therefore all of them still in being, notwithstanding <a id="l1736"></a>that the dominions of the three first have been long <a id="l1737"></a>since taken away. The Lyon  with its two wings <a id="l1738"></a>in Chaldea &amp; Media remains still standing upon its hinder <a id="l1739"></a>leggs with a mans heart &amp; by consequence alive; but his <a id="l1740"></a>wings are pluckt to signify that his dominion has been taken <a id="l1741"></a>away. The Bear had three ribs in his mouth to distinguish <a id="l1742"></a>his conquests from himself. The four heads &amp; four wings <a id="l1743"></a>of the Leopard were seated in Greece, Asia minor, Syria <a id="l1744"></a>&amp; Egypt, but have lost their dominion. And the eleven <a id="l1745"></a>horns of the fourth Beast are seated in the regions of the <a id="l1746"></a>Latines on this side Greece &amp; Egypt where we have found them. The Roman Empire <a id="l1747"></a>therefore on this side Greece &amp; Egypt is the proper body <a id="l1748"></a>of the Beast with his horns, &amp; the residue which he <a id="l1749"></a>stamped with his feet is so much of the three first Empires as he conquered. </p>
        <p id="par113">And in the same manner the Ram &amp; the He-Goat are to be <a id="l1751"></a>distinguished from one another. The Ram with his two horns is the <a id="l1752"></a>kingdom of Media &amp; Persia &amp; his horn which rose up first is the <a id="l1753"></a>kingdom of Media which rose up before the kingdom of Persia. <a id="l1754"></a>And as the Ram comprehends all the times of the two first Monarchies, so the <a id="l1755"></a>He-Goat comprehends all the times of the two last. He is the <a id="l1756"></a>Kingdom of Greece on this side Media &amp; Persia &amp; his first horn <a id="l1757"></a>is this kingdom in a monarchical form during the reign of its <a id="l1758"></a>three first Kings, Alexander the great, Philip Aridæus his <a id="l1759"></a>brother, &amp; Alexander Ægus his son by Roxana. And his four next <a id="l1760"></a>horns are the kingdoms of Macedon, Asia, Syria &amp; Ægypt <a id="l1761"></a>into which this Monarchy then brake. And in the latter time of <a id="l1762"></a>their kingdom when their dominion was ready to  be taken <a id="l1763"></a>away, a little horn rose out of one of them &amp; grew mighty <a id="l1764"></a>but not by his own power, not by the power of any of the four <a id="l1765"></a>horns for that was expiring, not by the power <a id="l1766"></a>of the Goat for that would have been the power of his horn; <a id="l1767"></a>but by a forreign power, a power which was to reign over the Leo<a id="l1768"></a>pard after his dominion was taken away. He grew mighty <a id="l1769"></a>towards the south &amp; towards the east &amp; towards the land of <a id="l1770"></a>delight, &amp; therefore rose out of the north west horn, &amp; extended <a id="l1771"></a>his dominion towards Egypt &amp; Syria &amp; Palestine. He reigned <a id="l1772"></a>a long time after his dominion was taken away: for this <a id="l1773"></a>Vision was at the time of the end &amp; at the last end of the <a id="l1774"></a>Indignation against the Iews; &amp; after he was grown mighty <a id="l1775"></a>he took away the daily sacrifice &amp; cast down the Sanctuary <a id="l1776"></a>to the grownd, &amp; in this state things continued 2300 years 
            <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p036r"> &lt;36r&gt; </span> before the Sanctuary was cleansed. So then the Goat in <a id="l1777"></a>the reign of his last horn signifies the same thing with the <a id="l1778"></a>Leopard after his dominion is taken away &amp; his life is prolonged <a id="l1779"></a>under the  power of the conqueror. In this state he grows <a id="l1780"></a>mighty but not by his own power. And all this points out the <a id="l1781"></a>kingdom of Pergamus. For this rose out of one of the four, was <a id="l1782"></a>at first a little one &amp; grew mighty by the power of the Romans. <a id="l1783"></a>At first it was nothing more then  the city Pergamus with its <a id="l1784"></a>castel &amp; villages revolting from Lysimachus king of Macedon <a id="l1785"></a>Thrace Caria Lydia &amp; Phrygia. But two years before the death <a id="l1786"></a>of Antiochus magnus, by the assistance of the Romans, it was <a id="l1787"></a>enlarged over all Asia minor on this side the mountain <a id="l1788"></a>Taurus, &amp; soon after it was inherited by the Romans by the <a id="l1789"></a>last will &amp; testament of its king Attalus, &amp; by their power <a id="l1790"></a>&amp; under their administration as successors to its kings, it <a id="l1791"></a>grew mighty towards the south &amp; towards the east &amp; towards <a id="l1792"></a>the Holy Land, conquering Syria Palestine &amp; Egypt; &amp; then <a id="l1793"></a>it took away the daily sacrifice &amp; cast down the sanctuary to <a id="l1794"></a>the grownd, &amp; at length separated from the Latines &amp; is now under <a id="l1795"></a>the dominion of the Turks.</p>
        <p id="par114">And all this is described more at large in the Prophesy <a id="l1796"></a>of the scripture of truth. For this Prophesy is nothing else <a id="l1797"></a>then a commentary upon the Prophesy of the Ram &amp; He-goat <a id="l1798"></a>And here Daniel after he had mentioned the kingdom of <a id="l1799"></a>Persia then beginning to reigne, &amp; predicted the invasion of <a id="l1800"></a>Greece by the fourth king of Persia who was Xerxes, he adds <a id="l1801"></a>that the kingdom of Greece should afterwards stand up with a <a id="l1802"></a>mighty dominion &amp; be broken into four great kingdoms to the <a id="l1803"></a>four winds of heaven, (which are the four horns of the Goat;) &amp; <a id="l1804"></a>then he describes the actions of two of those kingdoms whose kings <a id="l1805"></a>he calls the kings of the south &amp; north, &amp; proceeds in this description <a id="l1806"></a>untill the eighth year of Antiochus Epiphanes, the year in <a id="l1807"></a>which the Romans conquered Macedonia the chief of the <a id="l1808"></a>four kingdoms, that is, untill the four horns began to lose <a id="l1809"></a>their dominion, or untill the latter time of their kingdom, <a id="l1810"></a>at which time the transgressors who sided with Antiochus Epiphanes <a id="l1811"></a>against the holy covenant, were come to the full. And then he <a id="l1812"></a>breaks off this description, &amp; proceeds to describe the power by which <a id="l1813"></a>the little horn of the Goat was to grow mighty. <em class="underline">And after him</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">arms <a id="l1814"></a>shall stand up, &amp; they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength <a id="l1815"></a>&amp; take away the daily sacrifice</em> &amp;c.

        <p id="par120">Now when the Romans made war upon the Iews they looked <a id="l1950"></a>upon all the Iews (the Christian Iews as well as others) to be their ene<a id="l1951"></a>mies &amp; upon all the Christian Gentiles to be friends to the Christian <a id="l1952"></a>Iews &amp; for that reason began from that time forward to vex the <a id="l1953"></a>Christians. And because the Christians were united in one body &amp; were enemies to the heathen <a id="l1954"></a>religion, the heathens continued to vex &amp; persecute them from 
            <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p041r"> &lt;41r&gt; </span>time to time till the reign of Constantine the great &amp; his sons, <a id="l1955"></a>And then the Empire becoming Christian great multitudes of hea<a id="l1956"></a>thens came over to the profession of the Christian religion. All <a id="l1957"></a>which is thus exprest by Daniel. <em class="underline">And such as forsake the <a id="l1958"></a>covenant</em> [fals Christs &amp; fals Apostles called by Iohn the many Antichrists who went out from the Church &amp; by Paul the mystery of iniquity.] <em class="underline">shall seduce men <a id="l1959"></a>with flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall <a id="l1960"></a>be strong &amp; act.

They that fall are the stars which the last horn of the Goat cast down to the grownd &amp; stamped upon &amp; the many flatterers are they that at length by separating from the Church become the host of the little horn. They are the heathens who in the reign of <a id="l1967"></a>  <a id="l1968"></a>Constantine &amp; his sons flowed into the Christian churches in great <a id="l1969"></a>numbers for temporal end, being not truly converted but dissem<a id="l1970"></a>bling &amp; only making an outward profession of the Christian religion. <a id="l1971"></a>And these dissemblers made the Church numerous &amp; splendid in outward appearance but being still inclined in their hearts to the – <a id="l1972"></a>heathen superstitions &amp; continuing to live voluptuous &amp; vitious lives, <a id="l1973"></a>quickly corrupted the Christian religion filling it full of heathen <a id="l1974"></a> superstitions &amp; vitious practices; whereby the sincere part of <a id="l1975"></a>Christians who opposed the  superstitions &amp; vices of the <a id="l1976"></a>multitude could not avoid being involved in new troubles. For <a id="l1977"></a>the flatterers pressing into places of profit honour &amp; trust (which <a id="l1978"></a>was the end of their professing Christianity) easily prevailed by <a id="l1979"></a>their numbers &amp; power to establish their superstitions &amp; oppress <a id="l1980"></a> their opposers. And therefore Daniel adds: <em class="underline">But of those of</em> – <a id="l1981"></a><em class="underline">understanding there shall fall to try them &amp; to purge them</em> <a id="l1982"></a>from  flatterers] <em class="underline">to make  white even to the time <a id="l1983"></a>of the end; because it is yet for a time appointed</em>. These <a id="l1984"></a>last words, as I said, shew that this is a very notable period of time &amp; <a id="l1985"></a>begins a new scene of things, namely a new reign of the Greeks by the division of the R. Empire, &amp; a persecution of the saints by the <a id="l1986"></a>flatterers both which last till the time of the end. The flatterers there<a id="l1987"></a>fore now separate &amp; prevail in the Greek Empire &amp; become the host of the little horn &amp; begin to persecute the saints: for Da<a id="l1988"></a>niels adds in the nest words, <em class="underline">And the king [of Greek]  shall  do according to <a id="l1989"></a>his will, &amp; [by usurping a legislative authority in matters of religion &amp; by his host of flatterers] he shall exalt himself &amp; magnify himself above <a id="l1990"></a>every God &amp; shall speak marvellous things against the God of Gods</em> <a id="l1991"></a>&amp; <em class="underline">shall prosper</em> [in oppressing dispersing wearing out &amp; making desolate &amp; <a id="l1992"></a>destroying thesaints] <em class="underline">till the indignation</em> [against Gods people &amp; the holy covenant] <em class="underline">be accom<a id="l1993"></a>plished: for that which is determined shall be done</em>.</p>
        <p id="par121">Now the Empire soon after its conversion to Christianity <a id="l1994"></a>became divided into two Empire, the Empire of the Greeks seated <a id="l1995"></a>at Constantinople &amp; the empire of the Latines seated at Rome. <a id="l1996"></a>At Constantinople reigned Valens Theodosius Areadius &amp; <a id="l1997"></a>their successors. At Rome reigned Valentinian, Gratian, Valen<a id="l1998"></a>tinian II,  Honorius &amp; their successors: The Greek Empire by this division became <a id="l1999"></a>a new King, &amp; this is the the  king which <em class="underline">doth according to his will</em>. For Daniel in this prophesy notes what relates to the Greeks.</p>
        <p id="par122">The Greek Emperors by calling together Councils of <a id="l2000"></a>their own bishops imposed upon the Churches what laws they <a id="l2001"></a>pleased in matters of religion. For the Council decreed what ever <a id="l2002"></a>the Emperor pleased. And therefore Daniel adds: <em class="underline">And he shall <a id="l2003"></a>magnify himself above every God, and speak marvellous things</em> 
            <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p042r"> &lt;42r&gt; </span><em class="underline"> against the God of Gods</em>, that is, he shall speak <a id="l2004"></a>them as a lawgiver, &amp; by dictating laws against the laws of God he <a id="l2005"></a>shall exalt &amp; magnify himself above every God, &amp; weare out the <a id="l2006"></a>saints. For dictating laws in matters of revealed religion is usurping <a id="l2007"></a>divine authority &amp; sitting in God's throne, or as the Apostle <a id="l2008"></a>Paul expresseth, it is <em class="underline">exalting himself above all that is called <a id="l2009"></a>God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the Temple <a id="l2010"></a>of God shewing himself that he is God</em>. It is sitting in God's throne <a id="l2011"></a>in the Temple between the Cherubims where God dictated <a id="l2012"></a>laws to the Iews &amp; was worshipped by them. When Daniel <a id="l2013"></a>tells us that the little horn of his fourth Beast should <em class="underline">speak <a id="l2014"></a>great words against the most High &amp; wear out the saints of <a id="l2015"></a>the most High</em>: he means that this Horn should speak as a <a id="l2016"></a>Law-giver &amp; by making laws against the laws of God should <a id="l2017"></a>weare out the saints. For in the next words he adds that this <a id="l2018"></a>Horn should <em class="underline">think to change times &amp; laws &amp; they should be given <a id="l2019"></a>into his hand for a time times &amp; half a time</em>. And in the <a id="l2020"></a>same sence he tells us that the king who doth according to <a id="l2021"></a>his well should <em class="underline">magnify himself above every God &amp; speak <a id="l2022"></a>marvellous things against the God of Gods</em>, &amp; that the last horn of the He-Goat <em class="underline">magnified himself even to the Prince of the Host</em>.</p>
        <p id="par123">In the reigns of Constantine &amp; his son Constantius, the <a id="l2023"></a>profession of Monkery was set on foot in the Wildernesses <a id="l2024"></a>of Egypt &amp; Syria by Antony &amp; Hilarion, &amp; in the reign <a id="l2025"></a>of  Gratian &amp; Theodosius the Monks  two provinces  under the protection of the bishops of Alexandria &amp; Antioch being grown very <a id="l2026"></a>numerous crept into towns &amp; overspread all the Empire <a id="l2027"></a>They placed their religion in abstinence from marriage &amp; from <a id="l2028"></a>meats &amp; in bodily austerities which are hurtfull to themselves &amp; <a id="l2029"></a>of no use to mankind. And for these things they were admired <a id="l2030"></a>by all the Empire as men more holy then the rest. And there<a id="l2031"></a>fore Daniel adds: <em class="underline">Neither shall he regard the God of his fa<a id="l2032"></a>thers nor the desire of weomen</em>, that is, the lawfull desire <a id="l2033"></a>of weomen in matrimony, as the Apostle Paul thus explains: <sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> <a id="l2034"></a><em class="underline">In the latter times some shall depart from the faith, <a id="l2035"></a>giving heed to spirits of seduction &amp; doctrines of Ghosts <a id="l2036"></a>speaking lyes in hypocrisy having consciences seared as <a id="l2037"></a>with a hot iron, forbidding to marry &amp; commanding to <a id="l2038"></a>abstain from meats which God hath created to be received <a id="l2039"></a>with thanksgiving of them that know the truth</em>. These <a id="l2040"></a>Moncks were a new sort of Christians not instituted by <a id="l2041"></a>Christ or his Apostles nor heard of in the primitive <a id="l2042"></a>Churches. You may know then by their fruits. For they <a id="l2043"></a>were the ringleaders in bringing into the Christian Chur<a id="l2044"></a>ches all manner of heathen superstitions &amp; particularly <a id="l2045"></a>the doctrine of Ghosts, the invocation of the dead, the worship<a id="l2046"></a>ping of dead men's reliques &amp; pictures &amp; images &amp; the feigning <a id="l2047"></a>of miracles &amp;  legendary stories for promoting their <a id="l2048"></a>superstitions. And from that time the religion of the Moncks <a id="l2049"></a>became the religion of the empire. There remain to this day <a id="l2050"></a>among the heathens of Persia &amp; India certain sects of religious <a id="l2051"></a>men who place their religion in abstinence from marriage &amp; </p>

        <p id="par126">About four of five years before the reign of Valens, there began <a id="l2054"></a>to be a raimour of great miracles done at the shrines of the <a id="l2055"></a> Martyrs in Syria &amp; in his reign &amp; the reign of Theodosius <a id="l2056"></a>&amp; Areadius the reliques of the Martyrs were dispersed from <a id="l2057"></a>Egypt &amp; Syria into all the Empire &amp; lodged in churches <a id="l2058"></a>for their miraculous effects, &amp; an opinion was spread that <a id="l2059"></a>the dead saints heard our prayers, &amp; men began to invoke <a id="l2060"></a>them &amp; to set up their pictures in Cæmeteries &amp; Churches. <a id="l2061"></a>&amp; at length their Images also; the Moncks being the ring<a id="l2062"></a>leaders in these practises.

The <a id="l2185"></a>first is of the reign of the Greeks  untill the Romans began to conquer them; The <a id="l2187"></a>second is of the Romans over the Greeks untill the division <a id="l2188"></a>of their Empire into the Empires of the Greeks &amp; Latines; <a id="l2189"></a>The third is of the Greek Empire at Constantinople after <a id="l2190"></a>separation from the Latines untill the rise &amp; reign of <a id="l2191"></a>the Mahometans: And the fourth is of the Mahometans <a id="l2192"></a>reigning successively in the south &amp; north &amp; making war <a id="l2193"></a>upon the Greeks. And these periods are distinguished from <a id="l2194"></a>one another by saying in the beginning of the  <a id="l2195"></a>second, &amp; again in the beginning of the third that the <a id="l2196"></a>end is yet for a time appointed, &amp; calling the fourth the <a id="l2197"></a>time of the end. The second began with the  prac<a id="l2198"></a>tises against the daily sacrifices of the Iews; the third <a id="l2199"></a>with the rise &amp; reign of the religion of the Moncks, &amp; <a id="l2200"></a>the fourth with the rise &amp; reign of the religion of the – 
            <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p046r"> &lt;46r&gt; </span> Mahometans. In the second the abomination of the heathens was set <a id="l2201"></a>up in all Iudæa &amp; endeavoured by many persecutions to be set up <a id="l2202"></a>among the Christians  in the third the abomi<a id="l2203"></a>nation of the Moncks of invoking the dead which is a breach of the <a id="l2204"></a>first commandment was set up among the Christians in all the <a id="l2205"></a>Empire, in the  fourth the Monkish abomination of worshipping <a id="l2206"></a>Images which is a breach of the second commandment, was also – <a id="l2207"></a> set up in all the Empire; &amp; these abominations made <a id="l2208"></a>a desolation of Gods people wherever they were set up. In the <a id="l2209"></a>first of these periods the Goat reigned in his four horns, in the <a id="l2210"></a>second his little horn <em class="underline">waxed exceeding great</em> sideways <em class="underline">toward the <a id="l2211"></a>south &amp; toward the east &amp; toward the pleasant land, &amp;</em> upwards <a id="l2212"></a><em class="underline">even to the host of heaven &amp; cast down some of the host &amp; of <a id="l2213"></a>the stars to the grownd,</em>  in the <a id="l2215"></a>third this horn <em class="underline">magnified himself even to the Prince of the <a id="l2216"></a>host</em> becoming the king which exalts &amp; magnifies himself above <a id="l2217"></a>every God &amp; speaks marvellous things against the God of Gods, <em class="underline">&amp; <a id="l2218"></a>by him the daily</em> [worship]  <em class="underline">was <a id="l2219"></a>taken away, &amp; the place of his sanctuary</em>  <em class="underline">was cast down, &amp; an host</em>  <em class="underline">was given him against the daily worship in <a id="l2222"></a> the transgression</em>  <em class="underline">&amp; it cast down the truth to <a id="l2224"></a>the grownd &amp; it practised &amp; prospered &amp; destroyed wonderfully the mighty <a id="l2225"></a>&amp; the holy people</em>. And in the fourth the Transgression of desolation <a id="l2226"></a>was established &amp; continued to <em class="underline">the last end of the indignation</em>&amp; the cleansing of the sanctuary.</p>
        <p id="par132">And its observable that the first act against the holy covenant <a id="l2227"></a>was in autumn in the Iudiac year of Seleucus 143 when Antio<a id="l2228"></a>chus Epiphanes returned out of Egypt &amp; spoiled the Temple – <a id="l2229"></a>(1 Maccab. I. 20) &amp; that the last act of setting up the abomination <a id="l2230"></a>was in the beginning of the year of Christ 842, &amp; end of the Iu<a id="l2231"></a>daic year of Seleucus 1153 when a Council called at Constanti<a id="l2232"></a>nople by the Empress Theodora &amp; her son Michael, decreed that <a id="l2233"></a>Images which had been condemned &amp; thrown down by some former Em<a id="l2234"></a>perors, should be set up again &amp; venerated as before, &amp; a festival <a id="l2235"></a>was instituted to be kept annually on Feb. 11, in memory of their <a id="l2236"></a>restitution: &amp; that the difference between these two periods being <a id="l2237"></a>1010 Iudiac years, is the same with the difference between the <a id="l2238"></a>2300 &amp; the 1290 days, putting a day for a Iudaic year.</p>
        <p id="par133">And its further observable that Daniel describes the last end <a id="l2239"></a>of all these things by three steps or successive events. The first <a id="l2240"></a>event is the fall of the last horn of the fourth Beast in the end <a id="l2241"></a>of <em class="underline">a time times &amp; half a time</em>, the second event is the fall of <a id="l2242"></a>the last horn of the Goat in the end of the indignation when <em class="underline">God <a id="l2243"></a>shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people</em> &amp; the sanctuary shall be cleansed <a id="l2244"></a>For this horn lasts till the indignation be accomplished, Dan. VIII. 19. <a id="l2245"></a>&amp; XI. 36. And the third event is at the resurrection of Daniel &amp; by <a id="l2246"></a>consequence at the day of judgement. But of that day &amp; hour knoweth <a id="l2247"></a>no man. These three events he describes in this manner. <em class="underline">And one said to the man cloathed in linnen who was upon the <a id="l2248"></a>waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? And I heard <a id="l2249"></a>the man cloathed in linnen who was upon the waters of the river when he lift up his <a id="l2250"></a>right hand &amp; his left unto heaven &amp; sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall <a id="l2251"></a>be fore a time times &amp; an half. And</em> [after that] <em class="underline">when he shall have</em> [further] <em class="underline">ac<a id="l2252"></a>complished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished. And <a id="l2253"></a>I heard but I understood not. Then said I, O my Lord what shall be the end of these things</em> 
            <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p046v"> &lt;46v&gt; </span> [when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people] <a id="l2254"></a>&amp; all these things shall be finished?] <em class="underline">And he said – from the time that the Daily sacrifice shall be taken <a id="l2255"></a>away  &amp; the abomination that maketh desolate set up</em> [unto <a id="l2256"></a>that accomplishment,  there shall be] <em class="underline">a thousand two hundred &amp; ninety <a id="l2257"></a>days. // Blessed is he that waiteth &amp; cometh to the thousand three</em> hundred <a id="l2258"></a>&amp; five &amp; thirty days. But go thou thy way Daniel for thou shalt rest &amp; stand in thy lot at the end of the days.</p>
        <p id="par134">The four Empires being described by the Image of four metalls <a id="l2259"></a>&amp; again by the vision of the four Beasts; &amp; the third Empire being <a id="l2260"></a> more fully described by the vision of the he-Goat &amp; still <a id="l2261"></a>more fully by the prophesy of the scripture of truth: a fuller descrip<a id="l2262"></a>tion of the fourth Empire was reserved for the visions of Iohn in <a id="l2263"></a>the times of the gospel. Daniels prophesies began with the times <a id="l2264"></a>of the Babylonian captivity, Iohn's prophesy was in the beginning <a id="l2265"></a>of the Roman captivity; &amp; the relation of the two captivities to one another is <a id="l2266"></a>represented  in Iohn's by giving the name of Babylon to Rome. It <a id="l2267"></a>remains that we consider the prophesy of Iohn for understanding <a id="l2268"></a>the times of the Roman captivity.</p>

This I learn out of <a id="l2272"></a>Elmacinus &amp; Abul-Pharajius two Arabian Historians. Elmacinus <a id="l2273"></a>writes thus. Anno Hegira 324 (qui cæpit Novem. 20 A.C. 935) as se venire <a id="l2274"></a>jussit Califa Arradis Billa Imperatorum Muhammedem f.

At ab eo tempore dignitas Consiliarij <a id="l2282"></a>Bagdadi obsolevit, ne remansit nisi nomen ejus. Potestas autem omnis <a id="l2283"></a>cessit Imperatoribus qui rerum potiebantur. At id duravit donec <a id="l2284"></a>florere desierunt. Salgjuki (i.e. Turcarum Imperatores Bagdadi.

        <p id="par136">To the same purpose writes Abul-Pharajius another <a id="l2299"></a>Arabic Historian whose words are thus translated. Anno [Hegiræ] <a id="l2300"></a>trecentisimo vicesimo quarto impulit necessitas Al-Radium ut <a id="l2301"></a>Abu Becrum Mohammedem filium Rayeki imperatorem exercitus <a id="l2302"></a>crearet.

        <p id="par137">Within less then two years after this change, Bagdad <a id="l2311"></a>(as Elmacius writes) was taken from Muhammed by one Iahcamus <a id="l2312"></a>a Turk, &amp; from that time often taken &amp; retaken, being in the <a id="l2313"></a>hands sometimes of the Turks &amp; sometimes of the Saracens <a id="l2314"></a>untill at length Togrulbec took it &amp; established it to the Turks</p>

He grew mighty <em class="underline">towards the south &amp; toward <a id="l2317"></a>the east &amp; toward the pleasant land</em>: &amp; therefore he was <a id="l2318"></a>to rise up in the north-west quarter of those nations &amp; extend <a id="l2319"></a>his dominion towards Egypt &amp; Syria &amp; Iudea. In the latter <a id="l2320"></a>time of the kingdom of the four horns it was to rise up out <a id="l2321"></a>of one of them (the north-west horn) &amp; to subdue the rest <a id="l2322"></a>but not by its own power. It was to be assisted by a forreign <a id="l2323"></a>power, a power superior to it self, the power which took <a id="l2324"></a>away the dominion of the third Beast, the power of the <a id="l2325"></a>fourth Beast. And such a little horn was the  <a id="l2326"></a>kingdom of Pergamus.</p>
        <p id="par141">For this kingdom by the revolt of  Phileærus king of Thrace Phrygia Lydia &amp; <a id="l2328"></a>Lycaonia, came out of one of the four horns. It arose in <a id="l2329"></a>the northwest &amp; was very little at its first rise. But <a id="l2330"></a>at length by the assistance of the Romans it took from An<a id="l2331"></a>tiochus magnus king of Syria almost all Asia minor on this <a id="l2332"></a>side the mountain Taurus. Afterwards it assisted the Romans <a id="l2333"></a>in conquering the kingdom of Macedon. Then it came under <a id="l2334"></a>the power of the Romans by the Legacy of Attalus its last <a id="l2335"></a>king An. Nabonass. 615; &amp; thereby the Senate of Rome <a id="l2336"></a>succeeded Attalus, &amp; became its king by right of inheri<a id="l2337"></a>tance. And then this kingdom by their power <em class="underline">waxed exceeding <a id="l2338"></a>great towards the south &amp; towards the east &amp; towards the <a id="l2339"></a>pleasant land</em>, conquering all the nations southward eastward <a id="l2340"></a>&amp; south-eastward which composed the body of the third Beast, <a id="l2341"></a>&amp; particularly Pontus, Armenia, Syria, Egypt &amp; Libya. <a id="l2342"></a>It grew mighty <em class="underline">towards the pleasant land, &amp; it waxed <a id="l2343"></a>great even to the host of heaven, &amp; cast down of the Host &amp; of the <a id="l2344"></a>starrs to the grownd &amp; stamped upon them</em>; conquering <a id="l2345"></a>Iudea by the conduct of Pompey An.

This <a id="l2362"></a>transgression is in the next words called the transgression of <a id="l2363"></a>desolation, &amp; in Dan. XI. 31 the abomination which maketh desolate, <a id="l2364"></a>&amp; in Matt. XXIV. 15, the abomination of desolation (spoken of by <a id="l2365"></a>Daniel the Prophet) standing in the holy place. And it may relate <a id="l2366"></a>chiefly to the worship of Iupiter Olympius in his Temple of the Iews, &amp; to the <a id="l2367"></a>revolt of the Iews under Barchochab occasioned thereby, &amp; to the <a id="l2368"></a>desolation of Iudæa which followed thereupon, all the Iews being <a id="l2369"></a>thenceforward banished Iudea upon pain of death. <em class="underline">then I heard</em>, saith Daniel, <em class="underline">one saint speaking, &amp; another saint said to him <a id="l2370"></a>that spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily

And he said <a id="l2372"></a>unto me, Vnto two thousand &amp; three hundred days; then <a id="l2373"></a>shall the sanctuary be cleansed</em>. Daniel's days are years <a id="l2374"></a>&amp; those years may be recconed either from the destruction <a id="l2375"></a>of the Temple by the Romans in the reign of Vespatian or  <a id="l2376"></a>from the pollution of the Sanctuary by the worship of Iupiter <a id="l2377"></a>Olympius, or from the desolation of Iudæa made in the end <a id="l2378"></a>of the Iewish war by the banishing of all the Iews out <a id="l2379"></a>of their country. And the difference of the times is but small <a id="l2380"></a>Henceforward the last horn of the Goat continued mighty under <a id="l2381"></a>the Romans till the reign of Constantine the great &amp; his <a id="l2382"></a>sons. And then by the division of the Roman Empire into <a id="l2383"></a>the Greek &amp; Latine Empires it separated from the <a id="l2384"></a>Latines &amp; became the Greek Empire alone, but yet <a id="l2385"></a>under the dominion of a Roman family; &amp; at present <a id="l2386"></a>it is mighty under the dominion of the Turks.</p>
        <p id="par142">The Goat in the days of his last horn is represented <a id="l2387"></a>in the Apocalyps by the great red Dragon, &amp; this Dragon <a id="l2388"></a>is there called Satan, &amp; Satan is there said to have his <a id="l2389"></a>throne in Pergamus to denote that he is the kingdom of <a id="l2390"></a>Pergamus represented by the last horn of the Goat.</p>
        <p id="par143">This last horn is by some taken for Antiochus Epi<a id="l2391"></a>phanes, but not very judiciously. A horn of a Beast is <a id="l2392"></a>never taken for a single person. It always signifies a <a id="l2393"></a>kingdom, &amp; a new  horn signifies a new kingdom, <a id="l2394"></a>&amp; the kingdom of Antiochus was an old one. Antiochus – <a id="l2395"></a>reigned over one of the four horns, &amp; the little horn was <a id="l2396"></a>a fift under its proper kings. This horn was at first a <a id="l2397"></a>little one &amp; waxed exceeding great, &amp; so did not Antiochus. <a id="l2398"></a>It is described great above all the former horns, &amp; so was <a id="l2399"></a>not Antiochus. His kingdom on the contrary was weak &amp; <a id="l2400"></a>tributary to the Romans, &amp; he did not enlarge it. The horn <a id="l2401"></a>was a king of fierce countenance &amp; destroyed wonderfully <a id="l2402"></a>&amp; prospered in his practices against the holy people: but <a id="l2403"></a>Antiochus was frighted out of Egypt by a mere message of <a id="l2404"></a>the Romans, &amp; afterwards routed &amp; baffled by the Iews. <a id="l2405"></a>The horn was mighty by anothers power, Antiochus acted <a id="l2406"></a>by his own. The horn stood up against the Prince of the <a id="l2407"></a>Host of heaven, the Prince of Princes, &amp; this is the cha<a id="l2408"></a>racter not of Antiochus but of Antichrist. The horn cast <a id="l2409"></a>down the Sanctuary to the ground, &amp; so did not Antiochus. <a id="l2410"></a>He left is standing. The Sanctuary &amp; Host were trampled <a id="l2411"></a>under foot 2300 days, &amp; in Daniels Prophesies days are <a id="l2412"></a>put for years: but the profanation of the Temple in <a id="l2413"></a>the reign of Antiochus  did not last so many natural <a id="l2414"></a>days. These things were to last till <em class="underline">the time of the end</em>, <a id="l2415"></a>till <em class="underline">the last end of the Indignation</em> against the Iews, &amp; <a id="l2416"></a>this Indignation is not yet at an end.
