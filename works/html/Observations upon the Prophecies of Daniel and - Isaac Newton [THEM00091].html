<h2 id="hd1" class="cent"><span class="large">Of the Church.</span> <a id="l1"></a><br>The Introduction.</h2>
<p id="par1">When Manasses<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> set up a carved image in the house of the <a id="l2"></a>Lord &amp; built altars in the two courts of the house to all the Host of heaven <a id="l3"></a>&amp; used inchantments &amp; witchcraft &amp; familiar spirits &amp; for his great wick<a id="l4"></a>edness was invaded by the army of Assarhadon king of Assyria &amp; carried cap<a id="l5"></a>tive to Babylon, the book of the law was lost till the eighteenth year of his <a id="l6"></a>grandson Iosiah. Then Hilkiah<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> the high Priest upon repairing the Temple <a id="l7"></a>found it there, &amp; the King lamented that their fathers had not done after <a id="l8"></a>the words of the book &amp; commanded that it should be read to the people <a id="l9"></a>&amp; caused the people to renew the holy covenant with God. This is the <a id="l10"></a>book of the law now extant.</p>
<p id="par2">When Sesak<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> came out of Egypt &amp; spoiled the temple &amp; brought <a id="l11"></a>Iudea into subjection to the monarchy of Egypt (which was in fift year <a id="l12"></a>of Rehoboam,) the Iews continued under great troubles for about twenty <a id="l13"></a>years; being without the true God &amp; without a teaching Priest &amp; <a id="l14"></a>without the law; &amp; in those times there was no peace to him that <a id="l15"></a>went out nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon <a id="l16"></a>all the inhabitants of the countries, &amp; nation was destroyed of nation, <a id="l17"></a>&amp; city of city, for God did vex them with all adversity. But when <a id="l18"></a>Sesak<sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> was dead &amp; Egypt fell into troubles, Iudea had quiet ten years <a id="l19"></a>&amp; in that time Asa built fenced cities in Iudea &amp; got up an army of <a id="l20"></a>580000 men with which in the 15<sup>th</sup> year of his reign he met &amp; overcame <a id="l21"></a>Zerah the Ethiopian who had conquered Egypt &amp; Libya &amp; Troglodytica &amp; <a id="l22"></a>came out with an army of 1000000  Libyans  <a id="l23"></a>&amp; Ethiopians to recover the countries  conquered by Sesak. And <a id="l24"></a>after this victory Asa dethroned his mother for idolatry, &amp; he renewed the altar &amp; brought new vessels of gold &amp; silver into the Temple<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup>, &amp; he &amp; the <a id="l25"></a>people entered into a new covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers <a id="l26"></a>upon pain of death to those who worshipped other Gods; &amp; his son Iehosa<a id="l27"></a>phat took away the high places &amp; in the third year of his reign <a id="l28"></a>sent some of his princes &amp; of the priests &amp; levites to teach in the cities <a id="l29"></a>of Iudah, &amp; they had the book of the law with them, &amp; went about <a id="l30"></a>throughout all the cities of Iudah, &amp; taught the people. This is that book <a id="l31"></a>of the law which was afterwards lost in the reign of Manasses &amp; found <a id="l32"></a>again in the reign of Iosiah, &amp; therefore it was written before the <a id="l33"></a>third year of Iehosaphat.</p>
<p id="par3">The same book of the law was preserved &amp; handed down to posterity <a id="l34"></a>by the Samaritans  &amp; therefore was received by the <a id="l35"></a>ten tribes before their captivity. For when the ten tribes were captivated<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>, a <a id="l36"></a>Priest of the captivity was sent back to Bethel by order of the king of <a id="l37"></a>Assyria to instruct the new inhabitants of Samaria in the manner of the <a id="l38"></a>God of the land, &amp; the Samaritans  had the Pentateuch from this <a id="l39"></a>Priest as conteining the law or manner of the God of the land which he <a id="l40"></a>was to teach them. For they persevered in the religion which he taught them<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> <a id="l41"></a>  joyning with it the worship of their own Gods, &amp; by persevering in what they <a id="l42"></a>had been taught they preserved this book of their law in the original character <a id="l43"></a>of the Hebrews, while the two tribes after their return from Babylon <a id="l44"></a>changed the character to that of the Chaldees which they had learned at <a id="l45"></a>Babylon.</p> 
<p id="par4">And while the Pentateuch was received as the book of the law both by the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> two tribes &amp; by the ten tribes, it follows that they received it be<a id="l46"></a>fore they became divided into two kingdoms. For after the division <a id="l47"></a>they received not laws from one another, but continued at <a id="l48"></a>variance. Iudah could not reclaim Israel from the sin of <a id="l49"></a>Ieroboam &amp; Israel could not bring Iudah to it. The Pentateuch <a id="l50"></a>therefore was the book of the Law in the days of David &amp; <a id="l51"></a>Solomon. The affairs of the Tabernacle &amp; Temple were <a id="l52"></a>ordered by David &amp; Solomon according to the law of this <a id="l53"></a>book, &amp; David in the 78<sup>th</sup> Psalm admonishing the people to give <a id="l54"></a>ear to the law of  God means the law of this <a id="l55"></a>book. For in describing how their forefathers kept it not <a id="l56"></a>he quotes many historical things out of the books of Exodus &amp; Num<a id="l57"></a>bers.</p>
<p id="par5">The race of the kings of Edom before there  reigned any king <a id="l58"></a> over Israel is set down in the book of Genesis<sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup>, &amp; there<a id="l59"></a>fore that book was not written entirely in the form now extant before the reign of Saul. <a id="l60"></a>The writer set down the race of those kings till his own <a id="l61"></a>time &amp; therefore wrote before David conquered Edom. <a id="l62"></a>The Pentateuch is composed of the Law &amp; the history of Gods <a id="l63"></a>people together, &amp; the history hath been collected from se<a id="l64"></a>veral books, such as were the history of the creation com<a id="l65"></a>posed by Moses ( Exod. 20.11.) the book of the generations of Adam <a id="l66"></a>(Gen.5) &amp; the book of the wars of the Lord, Num. 21.14. This <a id="l67"></a>book of wars conteined what was done at the red sea &amp; in the <a id="l68"></a>journeying of Israel through the wilderness, &amp; therefore was begun <a id="l69"></a>by Moses. And Ioshua might carry it on  to the conquest <a id="l70"></a>of Canaan. For Ioshua wrote some things in the book of the <a id="l71"></a>law of God (Ios. 24.26.) &amp; therefore might write his own wars <a id="l72"></a>in the book of wars, those being the principal wars of God. These <a id="l73"></a>were publick books &amp; therefore not written without the authority <a id="l74"></a>of Moses &amp; Ioshua. And Samuel had leasure in the reign of <a id="l75"></a>Saul to put them into the form of the books of Moses &amp; <a id="l76"></a>Ioshua now extant inserting into the Book of Genesis, the race of the kings of Edom, until their reigned a king in Israel.</p>
<p id="par6">The book of the Iudges is a continued history of the Iudges <a id="l77"></a>down to the death of Sampson &amp; therefore was compiled after <a id="l78"></a>his death out of the Acts of the Iudges. Several things  in this book are said to be done when there was no <a id="l80"></a>king in Israel (Iudg. 17.6 &amp; 18.1 &amp; 19.1 &amp; 21.5) &amp; therefore this <a id="l81"></a>book was written after the beginning of the reign of Saul. <a id="l82"></a>When it was written, the Iebusite dwelt in Ierusalem (Iud. 1.<a id="l83"></a>21) &amp; therefore it was written before the  eighth year of David <a id="l84"></a>2 Sam. 5.8. &amp; 1 Chron. 11.6. The books of Moses, Ioshua, &amp; Iudges <a id="l85"></a> contein one continued history down from the creation to the death <a id="l86"></a>of Sampson. Where the Pentateuch ends the book of Ioshua begins <a id="l87"></a>&amp; where the book of Ioshua ends the book of Iudges beginns. And <a id="l88"></a>therefore all these books have been composed out of the writings of <a id="l89"></a>Moses Ioshua &amp; other records by one &amp; the same hand after the <a id="l90"></a>beginning of the reign of Saul &amp; before the eighth year of David. <a id="l91"></a>And Samuel was a  sacred writer (1 Sam. 10.25) &amp; acquainted with <a id="l92"></a>the history of Moses &amp; the Iudges (1 Sam. 12.8, 9, 10, 11, 12) &amp; had leasure <a id="l93"></a>in the reign of Saul &amp; sufficient authority to compose these books. He was <a id="l94"></a>a prophet, &amp;  Iudged  Israel  all the days of his life &amp; was in the greatest esteem with the people; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> &amp; the law by which he was to judge the people was not to <a id="l95"></a>be published by less authority then his own the law-maker being not inferior to the judge. And the book of Iasher <a id="l96"></a>which is quoted in the book of Ioshua (Ios. 10.13) was in being at the <a id="l97"></a>death of Saul, 2 Sam. 1.18.</p>
<p id="par7">At the dedication of the Temple of Solomon when the Ark <a id="l98"></a>was brought into the most Holy, there was nothing in it but the <a id="l99"></a>two tables (1 King. 8.9) &amp; therefore when the Philistines took the <a id="l100"></a>Ark, they took out of it the Book of the Law &amp; the golden pot <a id="l101"></a>of manna &amp; Aarons rod. And this &amp; other losses  in the desolati<a id="l102"></a>on of Israel by the conquering Philistims, might give occasion to Sa<a id="l103"></a>muel, after some respite from those enemies, to recollect the scattered <a id="l104"></a>writings of Moses &amp; Ioshua &amp; the Records of the Patriarchs &amp; Iudges &amp; compose <a id="l105"></a>them in the form now extant.</p>
<p id="par8">The book of Ruth is a history of things done in the days <a id="l106"></a>of the Iudges &amp; may be looked upon as an addition to the book of the Iudges written by the same author &amp; at the same time. <a id="l107"></a>For it was written after the  birth of David (Ruth IV.17, 22) &amp; not long after because the history of Booz &amp; Ruth the great <a id="l109"></a>grandfather &amp; great grandmother of David &amp;  that of their contemporaries could not <a id="l110"></a>well be remembred above two or three generations. And since this <a id="l111"></a>book derives the genealogy of David from Booz &amp; Ruth &amp; omits <a id="l112"></a>Davids elder brothers &amp; his sons; it was written in honour <a id="l113"></a>of David after he was annointed King by Samuel &amp; before <a id="l114"></a>he had children in Hebron &amp; by consequence in the reign of <a id="l115"></a>Saul. It proceeds not to the history of David &amp; therefore seems <a id="l116"></a>to have been written presently after he was annointed. They <a id="l117"></a>judge well therefore who ascribe to Samuel the books of Ioshua <a id="l118"></a>Iudges &amp; Ruth.</p>
<p id="par9">Samuel is also reputed the author of the first book of Sa<a id="l119"></a>muel till the time of his death. The two books of Samuel cite no <a id="l120"></a>authors &amp; therefore seem to be originals. They begin with his gene<a id="l121"></a>alogy birth &amp; education &amp;    might be written partly in his life time by himself or   his disciples the Prophets at Naioth in Ramah (1 Sam. 19. 18, 19, 20) &amp; partly after his death by the same disciples.</p>
<p id="par10">The books of the kings cite other authors, as the book of the <a id="l126"></a>Acts of Solomon, the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel &amp; <a id="l127"></a>the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah. The books of the <a id="l128"></a>Chronicles cite the book of Samuel the Seer, the book of Nathan the <a id="l129"></a>prophet, &amp; the book of Gad the Seer for the acts of David; the book <a id="l130"></a>of Nathan the prophet, the prophesy of Ahijah the  Shilonite &amp; the <a id="l131"></a>visions of Iddo the Seer for the Acts of Solomon; the book of <a id="l132"></a>Shemajah the prophet, &amp; the book of Iddo the Seer concerning <a id="l133"></a>genealogies, for the Acts of Rehoboam &amp; Abijah; the book of <a id="l134"></a>the kings of Iudah &amp; Israel for the acts of Asa, Ioash, Ama<a id="l135"></a>ziah, Iotham, Azaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, &amp; Iosiah; the book of <a id="l136"></a>Hanani the Seer for the Acts of Iehosaphat; &amp; the visions of Isaiah <a id="l137"></a>for the Acts of Vzziah &amp; Hezekiah. <sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup>[These books were therefore <a id="l138"></a>collected out of the historical writings of the ancient Seers &amp; Prophets. <a id="l139"></a>And because the books of the Kings &amp; Chronicles quote one another <a id="l140"></a>they were written at one &amp; the same time. And this time was after <a id="l141"></a>the return from the Babylonian captivity because they bring down <a id="l142"></a>the history of Iudah &amp; the genealogies of the Kings of Iudah &amp; <a id="l143"></a>of the high Priests to that captivity. And the book of Ezra was <a id="l144"></a>originally a part of the book of the Chronicles &amp; has been divided <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> from it. For it begins with the two last verses of the books of <a id="l145"></a>Chronicles, &amp; the first book of Esdras begins with the two last chap<a id="l146"></a>ters thereof. Ezra was therefore the compiler of the books of <a id="l147"></a>Kings &amp; Chronicles &amp; brought down the history to his own time. <a id="l148"></a>He was a ready Scribe in the Law of God, &amp; for assisting him <a id="l149"></a>in this work Neemias founded a library &amp; gathered together <a id="l150"></a>the Acts of the kings &amp; the Prophets &amp; of David &amp; the Epistles <a id="l151"></a>of the Kings concerning the holy gifts, 2 Maccab. 2.13. By <a id="l152"></a>the Acts of David I understand here the two books of Samuel <a id="l153"></a>or at least the second book. Out of the Acts of the Kings  written from time to time by the Prophets he composed the books of <a id="l155"></a>the Kings of Iudah &amp; Israel, the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah <a id="l156"></a>&amp; the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. And in doing this he joyned those <a id="l157"></a>Acts together in due order of time, copying the very words of the <a id="l158"></a>authors, as is manifest from hence that the books of the kings <a id="l159"></a>&amp; Chronicles frequently agree with one another in words for <a id="l160"></a>many sentences together. Where they agree in sense there they <a id="l161"></a>agree in words.</p>
<p id="par11"> So also the prophesies of Isaiah written at several times he has <a id="l162"></a>collected into one body. And the like for those of Ieremy &amp; the <a id="l163"></a>rest of the prophets down to the days of the second Temple <a id="l164"></a>The book of Ionah is the history of Ionah written by another <a id="l165"></a>hand. The book of Daniel is a collection of papers written at <a id="l166"></a>several times. The six last chapters contein prophesies written <a id="l167"></a>at several times by Daniel himself: the six first are a collec<a id="l168"></a>tion of  historical papers written by others. The fourth <a id="l169"></a>chapter is a decree of Nebuchadnezzar. The first chapter <a id="l170"></a>was written after Daniels death: for the author saith that <a id="l171"></a>Daniel continued to the first year of Cyrus; that is to his <a id="l172"></a>first year over the Persians &amp; Medes &amp; third year over <a id="l173"></a>Babylon. And for the same reason the fift &amp; sixt chapters <a id="l174"></a>were also written after his death. For they end with these <a id="l175"></a>words: <em class="underline">So this</em> Daniel <em class="underline">prospered in the reign of</em> Darius <em class="underline">&amp; in <a id="l176"></a>the reign of</em> Cyrus <em class="underline">the</em> Persian. Yet these words might be added <a id="l177"></a>by the collector of the papers whom I take to be Ezra.</p>
<p id="par12">The Psalms composed by Moses David &amp; others seem to <a id="l178"></a>have been also collected by Ezra into one volume. I reccon him <a id="l179"></a>the collector because in this collection I meet with Psalms <a id="l180"></a>as late as the Babylonian captivity, but with none later.</p>
<p id="par13">After these things Antiochus Epiphanes spoiled the Temple <a id="l181"></a>commanded the Iews to forsake the law upon pain of death &amp; caused the <a id="l182"></a>sacred books to be burnt wherever they could be found, &amp; in these troubles <a id="l183"></a>the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel was entirely lost. But <a id="l184"></a>upon recovering from this oppression, Iudas Maccabeus gathered together <a id="l185"></a>all those writings that were to be met with (2 Maccab. 2.14) &amp; in reducing <a id="l186"></a>them into order, part of the prophesies of Isaiah or some other Prophet have been added to the <a id="l187"></a>end of the prophesies of Zechary &amp; the book of Ezra has been separated <a id="l188"></a>from the book of Chronicles &amp; set together in two different orders; in <a id="l189"></a>one order in the book of Ezra received into the Canon &amp; in another <a id="l190"></a>order in the first book of Ezdras.</p>
<p id="par14">And after the Roman captivity the Iews for preserving their tra<a id="l191"></a>ditions put them in writing in their Talmud, &amp; for preserving their scriptures <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> agreed upon an edition &amp; pointed it &amp; counted the letters of <a id="l192"></a>every sort in every book. And by preserving only this Edition <a id="l193"></a>the ancienter various lections, except what can be discovered <a id="l194"></a>by means of the Septuagint Version, are now lost, &amp; such <a id="l195"></a>marginal notes or other corruptions as by the errors of the <a id="l196"></a>transcribers before this Edition was made, have crept into the text, are <a id="l197"></a>now scarce to be corrected.</p>
<p id="par15">The Iews before the Roman captivity, distinguished the <a id="l198"></a>sacred books into the Law, the Prophets, &amp; the Hagiographa or Holy writings, &amp; <a id="l199"></a>read only the Law &amp; the Prophets in their Synagogues. And Christ <a id="l200"></a>&amp; his Apostles laid the stress of religion upon the Law &amp; the <a id="l201"></a>Prophets, Matt. 7.12 &amp; 22.4. Luke 16.16, 29, 31, &amp; 24.44. Acts 24.<a id="l202"></a>14 &amp; 26.22. Rom. 3.21. By the Hagiographa they meant the histo<a id="l203"></a>rical books called Ioshua, Iudges, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, <a id="l204"></a>Ezra, Nehemiah, &amp; Esther, the book of Iob, the Psalms, the books <a id="l205"></a>of  Solomon, &amp; the Lamentations. The Samaritans read only <a id="l206"></a>the Pentateuch. And when Iehosaphat sent men to teach in the <a id="l207"></a>cities they had with them only the book of the Law: for the <a id="l208"></a>Prophesies now extant were not then written. And upon the <a id="l209"></a>return from the Babylonian captivity Ezra read only the book <a id="l210"></a>of the Law to the people from morning to noon on the first <a id="l211"></a>day of the seventh month &amp; from day to day in the feast of <a id="l212"></a>Tabernacles: for he had not yet collected the writings of the <a id="l213"></a>Prophets into the  volume now extant but instituted the reading of them after the collection was made. By reading the <a id="l214"></a>Law &amp; the Prophets in the Synagogues those books have been <a id="l215"></a>kept freer from corruption than the Hagiographa.</p>

<p id="par17"> In the infancy of the nation of Israel when God had given them <a id="l231"></a>a law &amp; made a covenant with them to be their God if they would keep <a id="l232"></a>his commandments, he sent Prophets to reclaim them as often as they <a id="l233"></a>revolted to the worship of other Gods: &amp; upon their returning to him <a id="l234"></a>they sometimes renewed the covenant  which they had broken. <a id="l235"></a>These prophets he continued to send till the days of Ezra: but after <a id="l236"></a>their prophesies were read in the synagogues, those prophesies were <a id="l237"></a>thought sufficient. For if the people would not hear Moses &amp; the old <a id="l238"></a>Prophets, they would hear no new ones, no not tho they should rise <a id="l239"></a>from the dead. At length when a new truth was to be preached to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> the Gentiles, namely that Iesus was the Christ, God sent new Prophets <a id="l240"></a>&amp; teachers: but after their writings were also received &amp; read in the <a id="l241"></a>synagogues of the Christians, prophesy ceased a second time. We have <a id="l242"></a>Moses the Prophets &amp; Apostles &amp; the words of Christ himself, &amp; if we <a id="l243"></a>will not hear them we shall be more inexcusable then the Iews. For <a id="l244"></a>the Prophets &amp; Apostles have foretold that as Israel often revolted &amp; brake the <a id="l245"></a>covenant &amp; upon repentance renewed it , so there should be a falling <a id="l246"></a>away among the Christians soon after the days of the Apostles, &amp; that in the latter days God would destroy <a id="l247"></a>the impenitent revolters &amp; make a new covenant with his people. <a id="l248"></a>And the giving ear to the prophets is a fundamental character of the <a id="l249"></a>true Church. For God has so ordered the prophesies that  in the  latter days the wise may understand but the wicked shall do wickedly &amp; none of the wicked shall understand, <a id="l251"></a>Dan. 12.9, 10. The authority of  <a id="l252"></a>Emperors Kings &amp; Princes is humane. The authority of Coun<a id="l253"></a>cils, Synods, Bishops &amp; Presbyters is humane. The authority of the <a id="l254"></a>Prophets is divine &amp; comprehends the summ of religion,  recconing <a id="l255"></a>Moses &amp; the Apostles  among the prophets. And if an Angel from heaven preach <a id="l256"></a>any other gospel then what they have delivered let him be accursed. Their writings con<a id="l257"></a>tein the covenant between God &amp; his people, with instructions for <a id="l258"></a>keeping this covenant,  instances of Gods judgments upon them that <a id="l259"></a>break it, &amp; predictions of things to come. While the people of God <a id="l260"></a>keep the covenant they continue to be his people: when they <a id="l261"></a>break it they cease to be his  people or Church &amp; became the synagogue <a id="l262"></a>of Satan who say they are Iews &amp; are not. And no power on <a id="l263"></a>earth is authorised to alter this covenant.</p>
<p id="par18">The predictions of things to come relate to the state of <a id="l264"></a>the Church in all ages. And amongst the old Prophets Daniel is <a id="l265"></a>most distinct in order of time &amp; easiest to be understood: &amp; there<a id="l266"></a>fore in those things which relate to the last times he must be <a id="l267"></a>made the key to the rest. </p>

<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">Chap  2 <a id="l283"></a><br>Of the prophetic language.</h2>
<p id="par19">For understanding these prophesies we are in the first place to <a id="l284"></a>acquaint our selves with the figurative language of the Prophets. And this <a id="l285"></a>language is taken from the analogy between the world natural &amp; an  empire <a id="l286"></a>or kingdom considered as a world politique</p>
<p id="par20">Accordingly the whole world natural consisting of heaven &amp; earth signifies <a id="l287"></a>the whole world politique consisting of thrones &amp; people, or so much of it as is con<a id="l288"></a>sidered in the prophesy: &amp; the things in that world signify the analogous things in <a id="l289"></a>this. For the heavens &amp; the things therein signify thrones &amp; dignities &amp; those that <a id="l290"></a>enjoy them; &amp; the earth with the things therein the inferior people, &amp; the lowest <a id="l291"></a>parts of the earth called Hades or Hell, the lowest or most miserable part <a id="l292"></a>of the people. Whence ascending towards heaven &amp; descending to the earth are <a id="l293"></a>put for rising &amp; falling in power &amp; honour: Rising out of the earth or wa<a id="l294"></a>ters &amp; falling into them, for the rising up to any dignity or dominion out <a id="l295"></a>of the in[ferior<sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> state of the people or falling down from the same into that <a id="l296"></a>inferior state. Descending into the lower parts of the earth for descending <a id="l297"></a>to a very low &amp; unhappy estate. Speaking with a faint voice out of the <a id="l298"></a>dust for being in a weak &amp; low condition. Moving from one place to <a id="l299"></a>another for translation from one office dignity or dominion to another. Great earthquakes &amp; the shaking of heaven &amp; earth for the shaking of kingdoms <a id="l300"></a>so as to distract or overthrow them. The creating a new heaven &amp; earth &amp; <a id="l301"></a>the passing away of an old one,  or the beginning &amp; end of the world, for <a id="l302"></a>the rise &amp; ruin of the body politique signified thereby.</p>
<p id="par21">In the heavens the Sun &amp; Moon are by interpreters of dreams put for the per<a id="l303"></a>sons of Kings &amp; Queens, but in sacred prophesy which regards not single persons, the sun <a id="l304"></a>is put for the whole species &amp; race of kings in the kingdom or kingdoms of the world <a id="l305"></a>polytic shining with regal power &amp; glory: the Moon for the body of the common people <a id="l306"></a>considered as the kings wife: the starrs subordinate Princes &amp; great men, or for <a id="l307"></a>Bishops &amp; Rulers of the people of God when the sun is Christ. Light for the glory <a id="l308"></a>truth &amp; knowledge wherewith great &amp; good men shine &amp; illuminate others. Darkness <a id="l309"></a>for obscurity of condition, &amp; for error blindness &amp; ignorance. Darkning, smiting, or <a id="l310"></a>setting of the Sun Moon &amp; Starrs for the ceasing of a kingdom, or for the desolation <a id="l311"></a>thereof proportional to the darkness. Darkning the Sun, turning the Moon into blood, <a id="l312"></a>&amp; falling of the starrs, for the same. New Moons for the return of a dispersed <a id="l313"></a>people into a body politique or ecclesiastique.</p>
<p id="par22">Fire &amp; Meteors refer to both heaven &amp; earth, &amp; signify as follows. Burning <a id="l314"></a>any thing with fire is put for the consuming thereof by war. A conflagration  of <a id="l315"></a>the earth or turning a country into a lake of fire, for the consumption of a <a id="l316"></a>kingdom by war.

Riding on the clouds for reigning over much people. Covering the Sun <a id="l321"></a>with a cloud or with smoke, for oppression of the king by the armies of an enemy. <a id="l322"></a>Tempestuous winds (that is, the motion of clouds) for warrs.

<p id="par23">In the earth, the dry land &amp; congregated waters (as a Sea, a River, <a id="l327"></a>a Flood) are put for the people of several regions nations &amp; dominions. <a id="l328"></a>Embittering of waters for great affliction of the people by war &amp; per<a id="l329"></a>secution. Turning things into blood for the mystical death of bodies politique, <a id="l330"></a>that is for their dissolution.

<p id="par25">If the world politique considered in prophesy consists of many king<a id="l344"></a>doms, they are represented by as many parts of the world natural. As the <a id="l345"></a>noblest by the celestial frame, &amp; then the Moon &amp; Clouds are put for the <a id="l346"></a>common people. The less noble by the earth sea &amp; rivers, &amp; by the animals <a id="l347"></a>or vegetables or buildings therein; &amp; then the greater &amp; more powerfull <a id="l348"></a>animals &amp; taller trees are put for kings princes &amp; nobles. And because the whole <a id="l349"></a>kingdom is the body politique of the king, therefore the Sun, or a Tree, or a Beast, <a id="l350"></a>or Bird or a man whereby the king is represented, is put in a large significa<a id="l351"></a>tion for the whole kingdom; &amp; several animals, as a Lion, a Beare, a Leopard, <a id="l352"></a>a Goat, according to their qualities, are put for several kingdoms &amp; bodies <a id="l353"></a>politique; &amp; sacrificing of Beasts for slaughtering &amp; conquering of king<a id="l354"></a>doms; &amp; friendship between Beasts for peace between kingdoms. Yet sometimes <a id="l355"></a>vegetables &amp; animals are by certain epithites or circumstances extended to <a id="l356"></a>other significations; as a Tree when called the tree of life or of knowledge, <a id="l357"></a>&amp; a Beast when called the old serpent, or worshipped.</p>
<p id="par26">When a Beast or Man is put for a kingdom, his parts &amp; qualities are <a id="l358"></a>put for the analogous parts &amp; qualities of the kingdom. As the head of a Beast <a id="l359"></a>for the great men who precede &amp; govern. The tail for the inferior people <a id="l360"></a>who follow &amp; are governed. The heads, if more then one, for the number of <a id="l361"></a>capital parts or dynasties or dominions in the kingdom whether collateral <a id="l362"></a>or successive with respect to the civil government. The horns on any <a id="l363"></a>head for the number of kingdoms in that head with respect to military <a id="l364"></a>power. Seeing for understanding, &amp; the eyes for men of understanding <a id="l365"></a>&amp; policy, &amp; in matters of religion for Ἐπίσκοποι Bishops. Speaking <a id="l366"></a>for making laws. The mouth for a lawgiver, whether civil or sacred. <a id="l367"></a>The loudness of the voice for might &amp; power. The faintness thereof <a id="l368"></a>for weakness. Eating &amp; drinking for acquiring what is signified by the <a id="l369"></a>things eaten &amp; drunken. The hairs of a beast or man, &amp; the feathers <a id="l370"></a>of a bird for people. The wings for the  number of kingdoms represented by the beast. The arm of <a id="l372"></a>a man for his power or for any people wherein his strength &amp; power <a id="l373"></a>consists. His feet for the lowest of the people or for the latter end of <a id="l374"></a>the kingdom. The feet nails &amp; teeth of beasts of prey for armies &amp; <a id="l375"></a>squadrons of armies. The bones for strength &amp; for fortified places. The <a id="l376"></a>flesh for riches &amp; possessions. And the days of their acting for years. And <a id="l377"></a>when a tree is put for a kingdom, its branches leaves &amp; fruit signify as <a id="l378"></a>do the wings feathers &amp; food of a bird or beast.</p>
<p id="par27">When a man is taken in a mystical sense, his qualities are often <a id="l379"></a>signified by his actions, &amp; by the circumstances of things about him. So a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> Ruler is signified by his riding on a beast: a Warrior &amp; Conqueror by his <a id="l380"></a>having a sword &amp; bow: a potent man by his gigantic stature: a Iudge by weights <a id="l381"></a>&amp; measures: a sentence of absolution  or condemnation by a white or black <a id="l382"></a>stone: a new dignity by a new name: moral or civil qualifications by gar<a id="l383"></a>ments: honour &amp; glory by splendid apparel: royal dignity by purple or scarlet, <a id="l384"></a>or by a crown: righteousnes by white &amp; clean robes: wickedness by spotted <a id="l385"></a>&amp; filthy garments: affliction mourning &amp; humiliation by cloathing in <a id="l386"></a>sackcloth: dishonour shame &amp; want of good works by nakedness: error <a id="l387"></a>&amp; misery by drinking a cup of his or her wine that causeth it: propagating <a id="l388"></a>any religion for gain by exercising trafick &amp; merchandise with that <a id="l389"></a>people whose religion it is: worshipping or serving the false Gods of <a id="l390"></a>any nation by committing adultery with their princes, or by worshipping <a id="l391"></a>them: a Council of a kingdom by its image: idolatry by blasphemy: <a id="l392"></a>overthrow in war by a wound of man or beast: a durable plague of war <a id="l393"></a>by a sore &amp; pain: the affliction or persecution which a people suffers <a id="l394"></a>in labouring to bring forth a new kingdom by the pain of a woman <a id="l395"></a>in labour to bring forth a manchild: the dissolution of a body politick <a id="l396"></a>or ecclesiastick by the death of a man or beast: &amp; the revival of a <a id="l397"></a>dissolved dominion by the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<h2 id="hd3" class="cent">Chap. II. 3. <a id="l398"></a><br>Of the vision of the Image <a id="l399"></a><br>composed of four metals.</h2>
<p id="par28">The prophesies of Daniel are all of them related to one another <a id="l400"></a>as if they were but several parts of one general prophesy given at several times. <a id="l401"></a>The first is the easiest to be understood, &amp; every following prophesy adds something <a id="l402"></a>new to the former. The first was given in a dream to Nebuchadnezzar king <a id="l403"></a>of Babylon; in the second year of his reign; but the king forgetting his dream, it was given again to Daniel <a id="l404"></a>in a dream &amp; by him revealed to the king. And thereby Daniel presently <a id="l405"></a>became famous for wisdome &amp; revealing of secrets: insomuch that <a id="l406"></a>Ezekiel his contemporary in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar spake <a id="l407"></a>thus of him to the king of Tyre. <em class="underline">Behold</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">thou art wiser then <a id="l408"></a> Daniel, there is no secret that they can hide from thee.</em> Ezek <a id="l409"></a>XXVIII.3. And <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>t<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>he same Ezekiel in another place joyns Daniel with <a id="l410"></a>Noah &amp; Iob as most high in the favour of God. Ezek. XIV.14, 16, 18, 20. <a id="l411"></a>And in the last year of Belshazzar, the Queen mother said of him to <a id="l412"></a>the king. <em class="underline">Behold there [<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup>is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of <a id="l413"></a>the  holy Gods, And in the days of thy father, light &amp; understanding <a id="l414"></a>&amp; wisdom like the wisdome of the Gods, was found in him; whom the king <a id="l415"></a>Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father made master of the <a id="l416"></a>magicians, astrologers, Caldeans &amp; soothsayers: forasmuch as an excellent <a id="l417"></a>spirit  &amp; knowledge, &amp; understanding, interpreting of dreams, <a id="l418"></a>&amp; shewing of hard sentences, &amp; dissolving of doubts, were found in  the <a id="l419"></a>same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar.</em>  Dan. V.11, 12. Daniel <a id="l420"></a>was in the greatest credit amongst the Iews till the reign of the Roman Em<a id="l421"></a>peror Hadrian: &amp; to reject his prophesies is to reject the Christian religion. <a id="l422"></a>For this religion is founded upon his prophesy concerning the Messiah.</p>
<p id="par29">Now in this vision of the Image composed of four metals the foundation <a id="l423"></a>of all Daniels prophesies is laid. It represents a body of four great nations <a id="l424"></a>which should reign over the earth successively: viz<sup>t</sup> the people of Baby<a id="l425"></a>lonia, the Persians, the Greeks, &amp; the Romans. And by a stone cut out without <a id="l426"></a>hands, which fell upon the feet of the image, &amp; brake all the four metalls <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> to pieces &amp; became a great mountain &amp; filled the earth, it further represents that a new kingdom <a id="l427"></a>should arise after the four &amp; conquer all those nations &amp; grow very great <a id="l428"></a>&amp; last to the end of ages.</p>
<p id="par30">The head of the image was of gold, &amp; signifies the nations of Baby<a id="l429"></a>lonia who reigned first, as Daniel himself interprets. <em class="underline">Thou art this head <a id="l430"></a>of gold</em>, saith he to Nebuchadnezzar. These nations reigned till Cyrus conquered <a id="l431"></a>Babylon, &amp; within a few months after that conquest <em class="underline">revolted to the</em><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> Persi<a id="l432"></a>ans &amp; set them up above the Medes. The breast &amp; arms of the image were <a id="l433"></a>of silver &amp; represent the Persians who reigned next. The belly &amp; thighs <a id="l434"></a>of the image were of brass &amp; represent the Greeks who under the domi<a id="l435"></a>nion of Alexander the great conquered the Persians &amp; reigned next <a id="l436"></a>after them. The leggs were of iron &amp; represent the Romans who reigned <a id="l437"></a>next after the Greeks, &amp; began to conquer them in the eighth year of <a id="l438"></a>Antiochus Epiphanes. For in that year they conquered Perseus king of <a id="l439"></a>Macedon the fundamental kingdom of the Greeks, &amp; from thence forward <a id="l440"></a>grew into a mighty empire &amp; reigned with great power till the days of <a id="l441"></a>Theodosius the great. Then by the incursion of many northern nations <a id="l442"></a>they brake into many smaller kingdoms which are represented by the <a id="l443"></a>feet &amp; toes of the image composed part of iron &amp; part of clay. For then, <a id="l444"></a>saith Daniel, the kingdom shall be divided, &amp; there shall be in it of <a id="l445"></a>the strength of iron, but they shall not cleave  one to another.</p>
<p id="par31"><em class="underline">And in the days of these kings</em>, saith Daniel, <em class="underline">shall the God of heaven set up a <a id="l446"></a>kingdom which shall never be destroyed nor left to other people, but it shall break in <a id="l447"></a>pieces  &amp; consume all these kingdoms, &amp; it shall stand for ever: Foras much as <a id="l448"></a>thou sawest the stone was cut out of the mountains without hands, &amp; that it brake <a id="l449"></a> in pieces the iron, the brass, the silver &amp; the gold</em>.</p>

<h2 id="hd4" class="cent">Chap.  4 <a id="l450"></a><br>Of the vision of the four Beasts.</h2> 
<p id="par32">In the next vision, which is of the four Beasts, the prophesy of <a id="l451"></a>the four empires is repeated, with several new additions; such as are the <a id="l452"></a>two wings of the Lion, the three ribs in the mouth of the Bear, the four <a id="l453"></a>wings &amp; four heads of the Leopard, the eleven horns of the fourth Beast, <a id="l454"></a>&amp; the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven to the ancient of days <a id="l455"></a>sitting in judgment.</p>
<p id="par33">The first Beast was like a Lion, &amp; had eagles wings, to denote the <a id="l456"></a> kingdoms of Babylonia &amp;   <a id="l458"></a> Media, which overthrew the Assyrian Empire &amp; divided it between them, &amp; thereby became considerable, &amp; grew into great empires. In the former Prophesy the Empire of Babylonia was represented by the head of gold; in this both empires are represented together by the two wings of the Lion. <em class="underline">And I beheld</em>, saith Daniel<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup>, <em class="underline">till the wings thereof were <a id="l460"></a>pluckt, wherewith it was lifted up from the earth, &amp; made to stand upon <a id="l461"></a>the feet  as a man, &amp; a man's heart was given to it</em>; that is, till it was <a id="l462"></a>humbled &amp; subdued, &amp; made to know  its humane state.</p>
<p id="par34">The second Beast was like a Bear, &amp; represents the empire which <a id="l463"></a>reigned next after the Babylonians, that is, the empire of the Persians. <a id="l464"></a><em class="underline">Thy kingdom is divided</em> or broken, saith Daniel to the last king of Babylon, <a id="l465"></a><em class="underline">&amp; given to the Medes &amp; Persians</em>, Dan. V.28. This Beast <em class="underline">raised it self <a id="l466"></a>up on one side</em>; the Persians being under the Medes at the fall of Ba<a id="l467"></a>bylon, but presently rising up above them. <em class="underline">And it had three ribs in <a id="l468"></a>the mouth of it between the teeth of it</em>,<sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> to signify the kingdoms of Sardes, <a id="l469"></a>Babylon &amp; Egypt, which were conquered by it, but did not belong to its <a id="l470"></a>proper body. And it devoured much flesh, the riches of those three king<a id="l471"></a>doms.</p>
<p id="par35">The third Beast was the kingdom which succeeded the Persian; &amp; this <a id="l472"></a>was the empire of the Greeks, Dan. VIII.6, 7, 20, 21. It was <em class="underline">like a Leopard</em> <a id="l473"></a>to signify its fierceness, &amp; had four heads &amp; four wings to signify that <a id="l474"></a>it should become divided into four kingdoms Dan. VIII.22. For it conti<a id="l475"></a>nued in a monarchical form during the reign of Alexander the great <a id="l476"></a>&amp; his brother Aridæus, &amp; young sons Alexander &amp; Hercules; &amp; then brake <a id="l477"></a>into four kingdoms, by the governours of provinces putting crowns on <a id="l478"></a>their own heads, &amp; by mutual consent reigning over their provinces. Cassander reigned <a id="l479"></a>over Macedon, Greece &amp; Epire; Lysimachus over Thrace &amp; Bithynia; Ptolomy <a id="l480"></a>over Egypt, Lybia,  Arabia,  Cœlosyria, &amp; Palæstine;, &amp; Seleucus over Syria.</p>
<p id="par36">The fourth Beast was the Empire which succeeded that of the Greeks, &amp; this <a id="l481"></a>was the Roman. This Beast was exceeding dreadfull &amp; terrible, &amp; had great <a id="l482"></a>iron teeth, &amp; devoured &amp; brake in pieces, &amp; stamped the residue with its feet. <a id="l483"></a>And such was the Roman Empire. It was larger, stronger, &amp; more formi<a id="l484"></a>dable &amp; lasting than any of the former. It conquered the kingdom of <a id="l485"></a>Macedon, the fundamental kingdom of the Greeks, (together with Illyricum <a id="l486"></a>&amp; Epire) in the eighth year of Antiochus Epiphanes, Anno Nabonass. <em class="underline">500;</em><sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> <a id="l487"></a>&amp; inherited that of Pergamus Anno Nabonass. 615; &amp; conquered that of <a id="l488"></a>Syria Anno Nabonass. 679, &amp; that of Egypt, Anno Nabonass. 718. And by <a id="l489"></a>these &amp; other conquests it became greater &amp; more terrible then any of the <a id="l490"></a>three former Beasts. This Empire continued in its greatness till the reign <a id="l491"></a>of Theodosius the great; &amp; then brake into ten kingdoms, represented <a id="l492"></a>by the ten horns of this Beast; &amp; continued in a broken form, till the Ancient <a id="l493"></a>of days sat in a throne like fiery flame, &amp; the judgment was set, &amp; the <a id="l494"></a>books were opened, &amp; the Beast was slain &amp; his body given to the burning <a id="l495"></a>flames; <em class="underline">&amp; one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven &amp; was <a id="l496"></a>brought before the Ancient of days</em><sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup>, &amp; received dominion over all nations, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span> &amp; judgment was given to the saints of the most high, &amp; the time came <a id="l497"></a>that they possessed the kingdom.</p>
<p id="par37"><em class="underline">I beheld</em>, saith Daniel<sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup>, <em class="underline">till the Beast was slain, &amp; his body destroyed,  <a id="l498"></a>&amp; given to the burning flames. As concerning the rest of the Beasts, they <a id="l499"></a>had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a <a id="l500"></a>season &amp; a time.</em> And therefore all the four Beasts are still alive, tho <a id="l501"></a>the dominion of the three first  be taken away. The nations <a id="l502"></a>of Chaldea &amp; Assyria are still the first Beast. Those of Media &amp; Persia <a id="l503"></a>are still the second Beast. Those of Macedon, Greece &amp; Thrace, Asia <a id="l504"></a>minor, Syria &amp; Egypt,×<sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup> are still the third. And those of Europe on this <a id="l505"></a>side Greece are still the fourth. Seeing therefore that the body of the third <a id="l506"></a>beast is confined to the nations on this side  the river Euphrates, &amp; that the <a id="l507"></a>body of the fourth Beast is confined to the nations on this side Greece; we <a id="l508"></a>are to look for all the four heads of the third Beast, among the nations on <a id="l509"></a>this side of the river Euphrates; &amp; for all the eleven horns of the fourth <a id="l510"></a>Beast, among the nations on this side of Greece. And therefore, at the breaking <a id="l511"></a>of the Greek empire into four kingdoms of the Greeks, we include no part of <a id="l512"></a>the Chaldeans, Medes &amp; Persians in those kingdoms, because they belonged to <a id="l513"></a>the bodies of the two first Beasts. Nor do we reckon the Greek empire <a id="l514"></a>seated at Constantinople among the horns of the fourth Beast, because <a id="l515"></a>it belonged to the body of the third.</p>

<p id="par38">Dacia was a large country bounded on the south by the Danube, on the east by <a id="l519"></a>the Euxine sea, on the north by the river Neister &amp; the mountain Crapac, &amp; on <a id="l520"></a>the west by the river Tibesis, or Teys, which runs southward into the Danube a little <a id="l521"></a>above Belgrade. It comprehended the countries now called Transylvania, Mol<a id="l522"></a>davia, &amp; Wallachia, &amp; the eastern part of  the upper Hungary. Its ancient <a id="l523"></a>inhabitants were called Getæ by the Greeks, Daci by the Latines, &amp; Goths by <a id="l524"></a>themselves. Alexander the great attaqued them, &amp; Trajan conquered them, &amp; <a id="l525"></a>reduced their country into a Province of the Roman Empire: &amp; thereby the <a id="l526"></a>propagation of the Gospel among them was much promoted. They were composed <a id="l527"></a>of several Gothic nations, called Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Vandals, Gepides, Lombards, <a id="l528"></a>Burgundians, Alans, &amp;c: who all  agreed in their manners, &amp; spake the same <a id="l529"></a>language, as Procopius represents. While they lived under the Romans the Goths <a id="l530"></a>or Ostrogoths were seated in the eastern parts of Dacia, the Vandals in the <a id="l531"></a>western part upon the river Teys, where the rivers Maresh &amp; Keresh run <a id="l532"></a>into it. The Visigoths were between them. The Gepides, according to Ior<a id="l533"></a>nandes, were upon the Vistula. The Burgundians (a Vandalic nation) were <a id="l534"></a>between the Vistula &amp; the southern fountain of the Boristhenes, at some <a id="l535"></a>distance from the mountain Crapac northwards, where Ptolomy places them, <a id="l536"></a>by the names of Phrugundiones &amp; Burgiones. The Alans (another<sup><em>a</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup> Gothic <a id="l537"></a>nation) were between the northern fountain of the Boristhenes &amp; the mouth <a id="l538"></a>of the river Tanais, where Ptolomy placeth the mountain Alanus, &amp; western <a id="l539"></a>side of the Palus Mæotis.</p>
<p id="par39">These nations continued under the dominion of the Romans till the second <a id="l540"></a>year of the emperor Philip, &amp; then for want of their military pay began to revolt; <a id="l541"></a>&amp; the Ostrogoths set up a kingdom, which, under their kings Ostrogotha, Cniva, <a id="l542"></a>Araric, Geberic, &amp; Hermaneric, increased till the year of Christ 376; &amp; then by an <a id="l543"></a>incursion of the Huns from  beyond the Tanais, &amp; the death of Hermaneric, <a id="l544"></a>brake into several smaller kingdoms. Hunnimund, the son of Hermaneric, <a id="l545"></a>became king  over the Ostrogoths; Fridigern over the Visigoths; Winithar, <a id="l546"></a>or Vinithar, over a part of the Goths called Gruthungi by Ammian, Go<a id="l547"></a>thunni by Claudian, &amp; Sarmatæ &amp; Scythians by others; Athaneric over <a id="l548"></a>another part of the Goths in Dacia, called Thervingi; &amp; Box over the Antes <a id="l549"></a>in Sarmatia. And the Gepides had also their king. The Vandals fled over the <a id="l550"></a>Danube from Geberic in the latter end of the reign of Constantine the great, <a id="l551"></a>&amp; had seats granted to them in Pannonia by that Emperor, &amp; there lived <a id="l552"></a>quietly forty years, viz<sup>t</sup> till the year 377, when several Gothic nations <a id="l553"></a>flying from the Hunns came over the Danube, &amp; had seats granted them <a id="l554"></a>in Mæsia &amp; Thrace by the Greek Emperor Valens.. But the next year <a id="l555"></a>they revolted, &amp; called in some Goths, Alans &amp; Hunns, from beyond the <a id="l556"></a>Danube, &amp; routed the Roman army,  slew the emperor Valens, &amp; spread <a id="l557"></a>themselves into Greece &amp; Pannonia as far as to the Alps. But in the years <a id="l558"></a>379 &amp; 380 they were checkt by the arms of the Emperors Gratian &amp; <a id="l559"></a>Theodosius, &amp; made a submissive peace; &amp; the Visigoths &amp; Thervingi <a id="l560"></a>returned to their seats in Mæsia &amp; Thrace, &amp; the Hunns retired over <a id="l561"></a>the Danube, &amp; the Alans &amp; Gruthungi obtained seats in Pannonia.</p>
<p id="par40">About the year 373, or 374, the Burgundians rose from their seats  <a id="l562"></a>upon the Vistula with an army of eighty thousand men to invade Gallia; &amp; <a id="l563"></a>being opposed, seated themselves upon the northern side of the Rhine over <a id="l564"></a>against Mentz.  In the year 358, a body of the Salian Franks, with <a id="l565"></a>their king, coming from the river Sala, were received into the empire by <a id="l566"></a>the emperor Iulian, &amp; seated in Gallia between Brabant &amp; the Rhine. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> And their king Mellobaudes was made Comes domesticorum  by the <a id="l567"></a>emperor Gratian.  Richomer, another noble Salian Frank, was made <a id="l568"></a>Comes domesticorum, &amp; Magister utriusque Militiæ, by Theodosius; &amp; A.C. 384 <a id="l569"></a>was Consul with Clearchus. He was a great favourite of Theodosius, &amp; <a id="l570"></a> accompanied him in his warrs against Eugenius, but died in the expedi<a id="l571"></a>tion, &amp; left a son called Theudemir, who afterwards became king of the <a id="l572"></a>Salian Franks in Brabant. In the time of this war some Franks from <a id="l573"></a>beyond the Rhine invaded Gallia under the conduct of Genobald, Marcomir <a id="l574"></a>&amp; Suno, but were repulsed by Stilico; &amp; Marcomir being slain, was suc<a id="l575"></a>ceeded in Germany by his son Pharamund.</p>
<p id="par41">While these nations remained quiet within the Empire subject to the <a id="l576"></a>Romans, many others continued beyond the Danube till the death of the empe<a id="l577"></a>ror Theodosius, &amp; then rose up in arms. For Paulus Diaconus in his Historia <a id="l578"></a>Miscell. Lib. XIV, speaking of the times next after the death of this Empe<a id="l579"></a>ror, tell us: <em class="underline">Eodem tempore erant Gothi et aliæ gentes maximæ trans Danu<a id="l580"></a>bium habitantes: ex quibus rationabiliores quatuor sunt, Gothi scilicet, <a id="l581"></a>Huisogothi, Gepides &amp; Vandali; et nomen tantum &amp; nihil aliud mutantes. <a id="l582"></a>Isti sub Arcadio et Honorio Danubium transeuntes, locati sunt in terra <a id="l583"></a>Romanorum: et Gepides quidem (ex quibus postea divisi sunt Langobardi <a id="l584"></a>et Avares) villas, quæ sunt circa Singidonum &amp; Sirmium, habitavere</em>. And <a id="l585"></a>Procopius in the beginning of his Historia Vandalica writes to the same pur<a id="l586"></a>pose. Hitherto the western Empire continu'd entire, but now brake into <a id="l587"></a>many kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par42">Theodosius died A.C. 395; &amp; then  the Visigoths, under the conduct <a id="l588"></a>of Alaric the successor of Fridigern, rose from their seats in Thrace, &amp; <a id="l589"></a>wasted Macedon, Thessaly, Achaia, Peloponnesus, &amp; Epire with fire &amp; sword <a id="l590"></a>five years together; &amp; then turning westward, invaded Dalmatia, Illyricum &amp; <a id="l591"></a>Pannonia; &amp; from thence went into Italy A.C. 402, &amp; the next year were <a id="l592"></a>so beaten at Pollentia &amp; Verona by Stilico the commander of the forces <a id="l593"></a>of the western Empire, that Claudian calls the remainder of the forces <a id="l594"></a>of Alaric, <em class="underline">tanta ex gente reliquias breves</em>, &amp; Prudentius <em class="underline">Gentem deletam</em>. <a id="l595"></a>Thereupon Alaric made peace with the Emperor, being so far humbled <a id="l596"></a>that Orosius saith, he did <em class="underline">pro pace optima &amp; quibuscunque sedibus</em>  <em class="underline">suppliciter &amp; simpliciter orare</em>. This peace was ratified by mu<a id="l598"></a>tual hostages;  Ætius was sent hostage to Alaric; &amp;  Alaric <a id="l599"></a>continued a free Prince in the seats now granted to him.</p>
<p id="par43">When Alaric took up arms, the nations beyond the Danube began to be <a id="l600"></a>in motion; &amp; the next winter ( between A.C. 395 &amp;  396) a <a id="l601"></a>great body of Hunns, Alans, Ostrogoths, Gepides, &amp; other northern nations, <a id="l602"></a>came over the frozen Danube, being invited by Ruffin: &amp; their brethren <a id="l603"></a>also, who had obtained seats within the Empire, took up arms. Ierome <a id="l604"></a>calls all this great multitude, Hunns, Alans, Vandals, Goths, Sarmatans, <a id="l605"></a>Quades, &amp; Marcomans; &amp; saith, that they invaded all places between Constan<a id="l606"></a>tinople &amp; the Iulian Alps, wasting Scythia, Thrace, Macedon, Dardania, <a id="l607"></a>Dacia, Thessaly, Achaia, Epire, Dalmatia, &amp; all Pannonia. And the <a id="l608"></a>Suevians also invaded Rhætia. For when Alaric ravaged Pannonia, the Romans were defending Rhætia; which gave Alaric an opportunity <a id="l609"></a>of  invading Italy, as Claudian thus mentions.</p>
<div class="lg">
<p class="l">Non nisi perfidia nacti penetrabile tempus,</p>
<p class="l">Irrupere Getæ, nostras dum Rhætia vires</p> 
<p class="l">Occupat, atque alio desudant Marte cohortes.</p></div>
<p id="par44" class="i0">And when Alaric went from those parts into Italy, some other barbarous nations <a id="l610"></a>invaded Noricum &amp; Vindelicia, as the same Poet Claudian thus mentions.</p>
<div class="lg">
<p class="l25">Iam fœdera gentes</p>
<p class="l">Exuerant, Latijque audita clade feroces</p>
<p class="l">Vendelicos saltus &amp; Norica rura tenebant.</p>
</div>
<p id="par45" class="i0">This was in the years 402 &amp; 403. And among these nations I reccon the Suevians, <a id="l611"></a>Quades, &amp; Marcomans; For they were all in arms at this time,  The Quades &amp; Marcomans <a id="l613"></a>were Suevian nations; &amp; they and the Suevians came originally from Bohemia, <a id="l614"></a>&amp; the river Suevus or Sprake in Lusatia, &amp; were now united under one common <a id="l615"></a>king called Ermeric, who soon after led them into Gallia. The Vandals &amp; Alans <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015r"> &lt;15r&gt; </span> might also about this time extend themselves into Noricum. Also Vldin with <a id="l616"></a>a great body of Hunns passed the Danube about the time of Chrysostom's ba<a id="l617"></a>nishment, that is, A.C. 404, &amp; wasted Thrace &amp; Mœsia. And Radagaisus king <a id="l618"></a>of the Gruthunni &amp; successor of Winithar, inviting over more barbarians <a id="l619"></a>from beyond the Danube, invaded Italy with an army of above two hundred thousand Goths; &amp;  within a year or two (A.C. 405 or 406) was overcome by <a id="l621"></a>Stilico, &amp; perished with his Army. In this war Stilico was assisted with a <a id="l622"></a>great body of Huns &amp; Ostrogoths under the conduct of Vldin &amp; Sarus: They were <a id="l623"></a>hired by Emperor Honorius. And in all this confusion it was necessary <a id="l624"></a>for the Lombards in Pannonia to arm themselves in their own defence, &amp; <a id="l625"></a>assert their liberty, the Romans being no longer able to protect them.</p>
<p id="par46">And now Stilico purposing to make himself Emperor, procured a military <a id="l626"></a>prefecture for Alaric, &amp; sent him into the east in the service of Honorius the <a id="l627"></a>western Emperor, committing some Roman troops to his conduct to strengthen <a id="l628"></a>his army of Goths, &amp; promising to follow soon after with his own army. His pretence <a id="l629"></a>was to recover some regions of Illyricum, which the eastern Emperor was <a id="l630"></a>accused to detain injuriously from the western; but his secret design <a id="l631"></a>was to make himself Emperor, by the assistance of the Vandals &amp; their <a id="l632"></a>allies: For he himself was a Vandal. And for faciliating this designe, he <a id="l633"></a>invited a great body of the barbarous nations to invade the western Empire, <a id="l634"></a>while he &amp; Alaric invaded the eastern. And these nations under their seve<a id="l635"></a>ral kings, the Vandals under Godegisilus, the Alans in two bodies, the one <a id="l636"></a>under Goar, the other under Resplendial, &amp; the Suevians Quades &amp; Marcomans <a id="l637"></a>under Ermeric, marched through Rhetia to the side of the Rhine, <sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup>[leaving <a id="l638"></a>their seats in Pannonia to the Hunns &amp; Ostrogoths, &amp; joyned the Burgundians <a id="l639"></a>under Gundicar, &amp; ruffled the Franks in their further march.  On the <a id="l640"></a>last day of December A.C. 406, they passed the Rhine at Ments, &amp; <em class="underline">diffused</em><sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> <a id="l641"></a>themselves into <em class="underline">Germania prima</em> &amp; the adjacent regions; &amp; amongst other <a id="l642"></a>actions the Vandals took <em class="underline">Trevirs</em><sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup>. Then they advanced into Belgium, &amp; began <a id="l643"></a>to <em class="underline">ruffle</em><sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup> that country. Whereupon the Salian Franks in Brabant took up <a id="l644"></a>arms, &amp; under the conduct of Theudemir, the son of Ricimer, or Richomer, <a id="l645"></a>above mentioned, made so stout a resistance, that they slew almost twenty <a id="l646"></a>thousand of the Vandals, with their king Godegesilus, in battel; the rest escap<a id="l647"></a>ing only by a party of Resplendial's Alans  which came timely to their assistance.</p>
<p id="par47">Then the British soldiers, alarm'd by the rumour of these things, re<a id="l648"></a>volted, &amp; set up Tyrants there; first Marcus, whom they slew presently; then <a id="l649"></a>Gratian, whom they slew within four months; &amp; lastly Constantine, under whom <a id="l650"></a>they invaded Gallia A.C. 408, being favoured by Goar &amp; Gundicar. And Constan<a id="l651"></a>tine having possessed a good part of Gallia, created  his son Constans <a id="l652"></a>Cæsar, &amp; sent him into Spain to order his affairs there, A.C. 409.</p>
<p id="par48">In the mean time Resplendial, seing the aforesaid disaster of the <a id="l653"></a>Vandals, &amp; that Goar was gone over to the Romans, led his army from the <a id="l654"></a>Rhine; &amp; together with the Suevians, &amp; residue of the Vandals, went towards <a id="l655"></a>Spain; the Franks in the mean time prosecuting their victory so far as to <a id="l656"></a>retake <em class="underline">Trevirs</em><sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup>, which after they had plundered it, they left to the Romans. <a id="l657"></a>The Barbarians were at first stopt by the Pyrenean mountains, which made them <em class="underline">diffuse</em><sup class="note" id="n26-ref">[26]</sup> <a id="l658"></a>themselves into Aquitain: but the next year they had the passage betrayed to <a id="l659"></a>them by some soldiers of Constans; &amp; entring Spain 4 Kal. Octob. A.C. 409, every <a id="l660"></a>one conquered what he could; &amp; at length (A.C. 411) they divided their conquests <a id="l661"></a>by lot, &amp; the Vandals obtained Bœtica, &amp; part of Gallæcia, the Suevians the <a id="l662"></a>rest of Gallæcia, &amp; the Alans Lusitania &amp; the Carthaginensian Province: the <a id="l663"></a>Emperor for the sake of peace confirming them in those seats by grant A.C. 413.</p>
<p id="par49">Also the Roman Franks above mentioned, having made Theudemir their <a id="l664"></a>king, began streight after their conquest of the Vandals to invade their neigh<a id="l665"></a>bours. The first they set upon were the <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n27-ref">[27]</sup> Gauls of Brabant: but meeting with no<a id="l666"></a>table resistance, they desired their alliance. And so those Gauls fell off from the <a id="l667"></a>Romans, &amp; made an intimate league with the Franks to be as one people, <a id="l668"></a>marrying with one another, &amp; conforming to one another's manners, till they <a id="l669"></a>became without distinction. Thus by the access of these Gauls, &amp; of the <a id="l670"></a>foreign Franks also, who afterwards came over the Rhine, the Salian <a id="l671"></a>kingdom soon grew very great &amp; powerfull.</p>
<p id="par50">Stilico's expedition against the Greek Emperor was stopt by the order of <a id="l672"></a>Honorius; &amp; then Alaric came out of Epire into Noricum, &amp; requested a summ <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span> of money for his service. The Senate were inclined to deny him, but by  by Stilico's <a id="l673"></a>mediation granted it. But after a while Stilico being accused of a traiter<a id="l674"></a>ous conspiracy with Alaric, &amp; slain 10 Kal. Sept. A.C. 408, &amp; Alaric thereby <a id="l675"></a>disappointed of his money, &amp; reputed an enemy to the empire; he brake streight <a id="l676"></a>into Italy with his army which he brought out of Epire, &amp; sent to his brother <a id="l677"></a>Adolphus to follow him with what forces he had in Pannonia, which were not <a id="l678"></a>great but yet not to be despised. Thereupon Honorius fearing to be shut up <a id="l679"></a>in Rome, retired to Ravenna in October A.C. 408. And from that time Ravenna <a id="l680"></a>continued to be the seat of the western Emperors. In those days the Hunns also <a id="l681"></a>invaded Pannonia; &amp; seizing the deserted seats of the Vandals, Alans &amp; Goths, <a id="l682"></a>founded a new kingdom there.  Alaric advancing to Rome besieged it, &amp; <a id="l683"></a>9 Kal. Sept. A.C. 410 took it: &amp; afterwards attempting to pass into Afric, was ship<a id="l684"></a>wrackt. After which Honorius made peace with him, &amp; got up an army to send <a id="l685"></a>against the Tyrant Constantine.<sup class="note" id="n28-ref">[28]</sup></p>

<p id="par51">At the same time Gerontius, one of Constantine's captains, revolted from him, &amp; set <a id="l686"></a>up Maximus Emperor in Spain. Whereupon Constantine sent Edobec, another of <a id="l687"></a>his captains, to draw to his assistance, beside the barbarians under Goar &amp; Gun<a id="l688"></a>dicar in Gallia, supplies of Franks &amp; Alemans from beyond the Rhine; &amp; com<a id="l689"></a>mitted the custody of Vienna in Narbonne to his son Constans. Gerontius advancing, <a id="l690"></a>first slew Constans at Vienna, &amp; then began to besiege Constantine at Arles. But <a id="l691"></a>Honorius at the same time sending Constantius with an army on the same er<a id="l692"></a>rand, Gerontius fled, &amp; Constantius continued the siege, being strengthned by the <a id="l693"></a>access of the greatest part of the soldiers of Gerontius. After four months <a id="l694"></a>siege, Edobec having procured succours, the barbarian kings at Ments, Goar <a id="l695"></a>&amp; Gundicar, constitute Iovinus Emperor, &amp; together with him set forward <a id="l696"></a>to relieve Arles. At their approach Constantius retired. They pursued, &amp; <a id="l697"></a>he beat them by surprise; but not prosecuting his victory, the barbarians <a id="l698"></a>soon recovered themselves; yet not so as to hinder the fall of the tyrants <a id="l699"></a>Constantine, Iovinus &amp; Maximus. But Britain could not be recovered to <a id="l700"></a>the empire, but remained ever after a distinct kingdom.</p>
<p id="par52">The next year (A.C. 412) the Visigoths being beaten in Italy,  <a id="l701"></a>had Aquitain granted them to retire into: &amp; they invaded it with much violence, <a id="l702"></a>causing the Alans &amp; Burgundians to retreat, who were then depopulating it. <a id="l703"></a>At the same time the Burgundians were brought to peace; &amp; the Emperor <a id="l704"></a>granted them for inheritance a region upon the Rhene which they had in<a id="l705"></a>vaded. And the same I presume he did with the Alans. But the Franks not <a id="l706"></a>long after retaking &amp; burning <em class="underline">Trevirs</em><sup class="note" id="n29-ref">[29]</sup>, Castinus, A.C. 415, was sent against them <a id="l707"></a>with an army, &amp; routed them &amp; slew Theudomir their king. This was the second <a id="l708"></a> taking of <em class="underline">Trevirs</em><sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup> by the Franks. It was therefore taken four times, once by the <a id="l709"></a>Vandals &amp; thrice by the Franks. Theudemir was succeeded by Pharamond,  <a id="l710"></a>the Prince or King of the Salian Franks in Germany. From thence he brought <a id="l711"></a>new forces, reigned over the whole, &amp; had seats granted to his people  <a id="l712"></a>within the empire neare the Rhine.</p>
<p id="par53">And now the Barbarians were all quieted, &amp; settled in several kingdoms <a id="l713"></a>within the Empire, not only by conquest, but also by the grants of the emperor <a id="l714"></a>Honorius. For Rutilius in his Itinerary, written in Autumn, Anno Vrbis 1169, <a id="l715"></a>that is (according to Varro's computation then in use) A.C. 416, thus laments <a id="l716"></a>the wasted fields:</p> 
<div class="lg"><p class="l"><em class="underline">Illa quidem longis nimium deformia bellis</em>; &amp; then adds,</p>
<p class="l"><em class="underline">Iam tempus laceris post longa incendia fundis</em></p>
<p><em class="underline">Vel pastorales ædificare casas</em>. And a little after</p>
<p class="l"><em class="underline"> Æternum tibi Rhenus aret</em>.</p>
</div>
<p id="par54" class="i0">And Orosius in the end of his history, which was finished A.C. 417, represents <a id="l717"></a>now a general pacification of the barbarous nations by the words <em class="underline">comprimere, <a id="l718"></a>coangustare, addicere gentes immanissimas</em>; terming them <em class="underline">imperio addictas</em>, <a id="l719"></a>because they had obteined seats in the empire by league &amp; compact; &amp; <a id="l720"></a><em class="underline">coangustatas</em>, because they did no longer invade all regions at pleasure, <a id="l721"></a>but by the same compact remained quiet in the seats then granted them. <a id="l722"></a>And these are the kingdoms, of which the feet of the Image were hencefor<a id="l723"></a>ward composed, &amp; which are represented by iron &amp; clay intermixed, which <a id="l724"></a>did not stick one to another, &amp; were of different strength.</p>

<p id="par55">Now by the warrs above described the western empire of the <a id="l728"></a>Romans,  about the time that Rome was besieged &amp; taken by the Goths, became broken into the following ten kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par56">• 1 The kingdome of the Vandals &amp; Alans in Spain &amp; Afric</p>
<p id="par57">• 2 The kingdom of the Suevians in Spain</p>
<p id="par58">• 3 The kingdom of the Visigoths.</p>

<p id="par66" class="i0">Seven of these kingdoms are thus mentioned by Sigonius. <sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup>1 <em class="underline">Honorio reg<a id="l729"></a>nante, in Pannoniam <sup>2</sup> Hunni, in Hispaniam <sup>3</sup> Vandali, <sup>4</sup> Alani, <sup>5</sup> Suevi &amp; <a id="l730"></a><sup>6</sup> Gothi, in Galliam <sup>4</sup> Alani <sup>7</sup> Burgundiones et <sup>6</sup> Gothi, certis sedibus permis<a id="l731"></a>sis, accepti</em>. Add the Franks, Britains, &amp; Lombards, &amp; you have the ten. <a id="l732"></a>For these arose about the same time with the  seven. But let us view <a id="l733"></a>them severally.</p>
<p id="par67">1. The kings of the Vandals were, A.C. 407<sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup>, Godegisilus, 407 Gunderic, <a id="l734"></a>426 Geiseric, 477 Hunneric, 484 Gundemund, 496 Thrasamund, 523 Geiseric, <a id="l735"></a>530 Gelimer. Godegesilus led them into Gallia A.C. 406, Gunderic into Spain <a id="l736"></a>A.C. 409. Geiseric into Africa A.C. 427, &amp; Gelimer was conquered by Be<a id="l737"></a>lisarius A.C. 533. Their kingdom lasted in Gallia, Spain &amp; Africa together <a id="l738"></a>126 years; &amp; in Africa they were very potent. The Alans had only two <a id="l739"></a>kings of their own in Spain, Resplendial, &amp; Ataces, Vtacus or Othacar. <a id="l740"></a>Vnder Resplendial they went into France A.C. 407, &amp; into Spain A.C. 409. <a id="l741"></a> Ataces was slain with almost all his army by Vallia king of the Visi<a id="l742"></a>goths A.C. 419. And then the remainder of these Alans subjected them<a id="l743"></a>selves to Gunderic king of the Vandals in Bœtica, &amp; went afterwards <a id="l744"></a>with them into Africa, as I learn out of Procopius.  Whence the kings <a id="l745"></a>of the Vandals styled themselves kings of the Vandals &amp; Alans; as may <a id="l746"></a>be seen in the Edict of Hunneric recited by Victor in his Vandalic per<a id="l747"></a>secution. In conjunction with the <sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup>[Chatti, these Alans gave the name of <a id="l748"></a>Cathalaunia, or Catth-Alania, to the Province which is still so called. <a id="l749"></a>These Alans had also Gepides among them; &amp; therefore the Gepides <a id="l750"></a>came into Pannonia before the Alans left it. There they became <a id="l751"></a>subject to the Hunns till the death of Attila A.C. 454, &amp; at length <a id="l752"></a>were conquered by the Ostrogoths.</p>
<p id="par68">2. The kings of the Suevians were A.C.   407 Er<a id="l753"></a>meric, 483 Rechila, 448 Rechiarius, 458 Maldra, 460 Frumarius, <a id="l754"></a>463 Regismund. And after some other kings who are unknown, reigned <a id="l755"></a>A.C. 558 Theodemir, 568 Miro, 582 Euboricus, &amp; 583 Andeca. This <a id="l756"></a>kingdom, after it had been once seated in Spain, remained always in <a id="l757"></a>Gallæcia &amp; Lusitania. Ermeric after the fall of the Alan kingdom, <a id="l758"></a>enlarged it into all Gallicia, forcing the Vandals to retire into Bœtica &amp; <a id="l759"></a>the Carthaginensian Province. This kingdom  lasted 177 years according to Isidorus, &amp; then was subdued by Leo<a id="l761"></a>vigildus king of the Visigoths, &amp; made a Province of his kingdom A.C. 585.</p>
<p id="par69">3. The kings of the Visigoths were A.C. 400 Alaric, 410 Athaulphus, <a id="l762"></a>415 Sergeric &amp; Vallia, 419 Theoderic, 451 Thorismund, 452 Theoderic, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span> 465 Euric, 482 Alaric, 505 Gensalaric, 526 Amalaric, 531 Theu<a id="l763"></a>dius, 548 Theudisclus, &amp;c. I date this kingdom from the time that Alaric <a id="l764"></a>left Thrace &amp; Greece to invade the western Empire. In the end of the <a id="l765"></a>reign of Athaulphus the Goths were humbled by the Romans, &amp; attemp<a id="l766"></a>ted to pass out of France into Spain. Sergeric reigned but a few days. <a id="l767"></a>In the beginning of Vallia's reign they assaulted the Romans afresh, but <a id="l768"></a>were again repulsed, &amp; then made peace on this condition, that they <a id="l769"></a>should on the behalf of the empire invade the barbarian kingdoms in <a id="l770"></a>Spain. And this they did, together with the Romans, in the years 417 &amp; <a id="l771"></a>418, overthrowing the Alans &amp; part of the Vandals.  Then they <a id="l772"></a>received Aquitain of the Emperor by a full donation, leaving their <a id="l773"></a>conquests in Spain to the Emperor: and thereby the seats of the conquered <a id="l774"></a>Alans came into the hands of the Romans. In the year 455, Theoderic <a id="l775"></a>(assisted by the Burgundians) invaded Spain, which was then almost all <a id="l776"></a>subject to the Suevians, &amp; took a part of it from them. A.C. 506, the Goths <a id="l777"></a>were driven out of Gallia by the Franks. A.C. 585, they conquered the <a id="l778"></a>Suevian kingdom, &amp; became Lords of all Spain. A.C. 713, the Saracens <a id="l779"></a>invaded them, but in time they recovered their dominions, &amp; have reigned <a id="l780"></a>in Spain ever since</p>
<p id="par70">4. The kings of the Alans in Gallia were Goar, Sambida, Eocharic, <a id="l781"></a>Sangibanus, Beurgus, &amp;c. Vnder Goar they invaded Gallia A.C. 407, &amp; had <a id="l782"></a>seats given them near the Rhine, A.C. 412. Vnder Sambida (whom <a id="l783"></a>Bucher  makes the successor, if not the son of Goar) they had the territories <a id="l784"></a>of Valence given them by Ætius the Emperor's Generall, A.C. 440. Vnder <a id="l785"></a>Eocharic they conquered a region of the rebelling Galli Arborici, given them by <a id="l786"></a>Ætius. This region was from them named Alencomium, quasi Alanorum con<a id="l787"></a>ventus. Vnder Sangibanus they were invaded, &amp; their regal city Orleans besieged <a id="l788"></a>by Attila king of the Hunns, with a vast army of 500000 men. And Ætius &amp; the <a id="l789"></a>barbarian kings of Gallia came to raise the siege, &amp; beat the Hunns in a very <a id="l790"></a>memorable battel, A.C. 451, in  <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>×<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> campis Catalaunicis, so called from these <a id="l791"></a>Alans mixt with the Chatti. The region is now contractly called Campane. <a id="l792"></a>In that battel were slain on both sides 162000 men. A year or two after, <a id="l793"></a>Attila returned with an immense army to conquer this kingdom, but was <a id="l794"></a>again beaten by them &amp; the Visigoths together in a battle of three days con<a id="l795"></a>tinuance, with a slaughter almost as great as the former. Vnder Beurgus, or Bi<a id="l796"></a>orgor, they infested Gallia round about, till the reign of Maximus the Emperor; &amp; <a id="l797"></a>then they passed the Alps in winter, &amp; came into Liguria, but were there beaten, <a id="l798"></a>&amp; Beurgus slain, by Ricimer commander of the Emperor's forces, A.C. 464. Afterwards <a id="l799"></a>they were again beaten, by the joint force of Odoacer king of Italy &amp; Childeric king <a id="l800"></a>of the Franks, about the year 480, &amp; again by Theudebert king of the Austrian <a id="l801"></a>Franks about the year 511.</p>
<p id="par71">5. The kings of the Burgundians were A.C. 407 Gundicar, 436 Gundioc, 467 <a id="l802"></a>Bilimer, 473 Gundobaldus with his brothers, 510 Sigismund, 517 Godomarus. Vnder <a id="l803"></a>Gundicar they invaded Gallia A.C. 407, &amp; had seats given them by the Emperor <a id="l804"></a>near the Rhine in Gallia Belgica, A.C. 412. They had Saxons among them, &amp; <a id="l805"></a>were now so potent, that Orosius A.C. 417 wrote of them: <em class="underline">Burgundionum esse <a id="l806"></a>prævalidam manum, Galliæ hodieque testes sunt, in quibus præsumpta possessione con<a id="l807"></a>sistunt</em>. About the year 435 they received great overthrows by Ætius, &amp; soon after <a id="l808"></a>by the Hunns: but five years after had  Savoy granted them to be shared <a id="l809"></a> with the inhabitants; &amp; from that time became again a potent kingdom, being <a id="l810"></a>bounded by the river Rhodanus, but afterwards extending much further into the <a id="l811"></a>heart of Gallia. Gundobald conquered the regions about the rivers Araris &amp; Rho<a id="l812"></a>danus, with the territories of Marseilles; &amp; invaded Italy in the time of the Emperor <a id="l813"></a>Glycerius, &amp; conquered all his brethren. Godomarus made Orleans his royal seat: <a id="l814"></a>whence the kingdome was called <em class="underline">Regnum Aurelianorum</em>. He was conquered by <a id="l815"></a>Clotharius &amp; Childebert, kings of  the Franks, A.C. 526.  From thence <a id="l816"></a>forward this kingdom was sometimes united to the kingdom of the Franks, <a id="l817"></a>&amp; sometimes divided from it, till the reign of Charles the great, who made <a id="l818"></a>his son Carolottus king of Burgundy. And from that time, for about 300 <a id="l819"></a>years together, it enjoyed its proper kings; &amp; was then broken into the <a id="l820"></a>Dukedome of Burgundy, &amp; County of Burgundy &amp; County of Savoy; &amp; <a id="l821"></a>afterwards those were broken into other lesser Counties.</p>
<p id="par72">6.

<p id="par78">Now for Genobaldus, Marcomer &amp; Suno, they were captains of the <a id="l834"></a><em class="underline">Transrhenane</em> Franks in the reign of Theodosius, &amp; concern us not. We <a id="l835"></a>are to begin with Theudemer the first king of the rebelling Salij, called <a id="l836"></a>Didio by Ivo Carnotensis, &amp; Thiedo &amp; Theudemerus by Rhenanus. His face <a id="l837"></a>is extant in a coin of gold found with this inscription, THEVDEMER REX, <a id="l838"></a>published by Petavius; &amp; still or lately extant, as Windeline testifies: which <a id="l839"></a>shews that he was a king, &amp; that in Gallia, seeing that rude Germany under<a id="l840"></a>stood not then the coining of money, nor used either Latin words or letters. <a id="l841"></a>He was the son of Richemer, or Richomer, the favourite of the Emperor <a id="l842"></a>Theodosius; &amp; so being a Roman Frank, &amp; of the Salian royal blood, they <a id="l843"></a>therefore upon the rebellion made him king. The whole time of his reign <a id="l844"></a>you have stated in Excerptis Gregorij Turonensis e Fredigario, cap. 5, 6, <a id="l845"></a>7, 8, where the making him king, the tyranny of Iovinus, the slaughter of <a id="l846"></a>the associates of Iovinus, the second taking of <em class="underline">Trevirs</em><sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> by the Franks, &amp; their <a id="l847"></a>war with Castinus in which this king was slain, are as a series of <a id="l848"></a>successive things thus set down in order. <em class="underline">Extinctis Ducibus in Francis, <a id="l849"></a>denuo Reges creantur ex eadem stirpe qua prius fuerant.

Of his death Gre<a id="l861"></a>gory Turonensis makes this further mention: <em class="underline">In consularibus legimus <a id="l862"></a>Theodemerem regem Francorum  filium Ricimeris quondam, et Ascilam <a id="l863"></a>matrem ejus, gladio interfectos</em>.</p>
<p id="par79">Vpon this victory of the Romans, the Franks &amp; rebelling Gauls, who <a id="l864"></a>in the time of Theudemir were  at war with one another, united to <a id="l865"></a>strengthen themselves, as Ordericus Vitalis<sup><em>a</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup> thus mentions. <em class="underline">Cum Galli prius <a id="l866"></a>contra Romanos rebellâssent, Franci ijs sociati sunt, et pariter juncti <a id="l867"></a>Ferramundum Sunonis Ducis Filium, sibi regem præfecerunt</em>. Prosper <a id="l868"></a>sets down the time; <em class="underline">Anno 25 Honorij, Pharamundus regnat in Francia</em>. This <a id="l869"></a>Bucher well observ<em class="underline">es</em><sup class="note" id="n39-ref">[39]</sup>, refers to the end of the year  416, or the beginning <a id="l870"></a>of the next year, dating the years of Honorius from the death of Valen<a id="l871"></a>tinian; &amp; argues well, that at this time Pharamund was not only king <a id="l872"></a>by the constitution of the Franks, but crowned also by the consent of Ho<a id="l873"></a>norius, &amp; had a part of Gallia assigned  him by covenant. And this might <a id="l874"></a>be the cause that Roman writers reckoned him the first king: Which some <a id="l875"></a>not understanding have reputed him the founder of this kingdom by an army <a id="l876"></a>of the <em class="underline">transrhenane</em> Franks. And he might come with such an army, but <a id="l877"></a>he succeeded Theudemir by right of blood &amp; consent of the people. For the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span> above cited passage of Fredegarius, <em class="underline">Extinctis Ducibus in Francis denuo <a id="l878"></a>Reges creantur ex eadem stirpe, quâ prius</em>, implies that the kingdom con<a id="l879"></a>tinued to this new elected family, during the reign of more kings than <a id="l880"></a>one. If you date the years of Honorius from the death of his father, the <a id="l881"></a>reign of Pharamund might begin two years later than is assigned by <a id="l882"></a>Bucher. The Salique laws made in his <sup class="note" id="n40-ref">[40]</sup>[reign, which are yet extant, shew <a id="l883"></a>by their name that it was the kingdom of the Salij over which he reigned; <a id="l884"></a>&amp; by the pecuniary mulcts in them, that the place where he reigned, abound<a id="l885"></a>ed much with money, &amp; consequently was within the Empire, rude Ger<a id="l886"></a>many knowing not the use of money, till they mixed with the Romans. Also <a id="l887"></a>in the Preface to the Salique laws (written &amp; prefixed to them soon after the <a id="l888"></a>conversion of the Franks to the Christian religion, that is, in the end of the <a id="l889"></a>reign of Merovæus, or soon after,) the original of this kingdom is thus described: <a id="l890"></a><em class="underline">Hæc enim gens, quæ fortis dum esset, et robore valida, Romanorum jugum <a id="l891"></a>durissimum de suis cervicibus excussit pugnando</em>, &amp;c. This kingdom there<a id="l892"></a>fore was erected, not by invasion but by rebellion, as was described above. <a id="l893"></a>Prosper in regestring their kings in order, tells us: Pharamundus regnat <a id="l894"></a>in Francia; Clodio regnat in Francia; Merovæus regnat in Francia: <a id="l895"></a>&amp; who can imagin but that in all these places he meant one &amp; the same <a id="l896"></a>Francia? And yet it's certain that the Francia of Merovæus was in <a id="l897"></a>Gallia.</p>
<p id="par80">Yet the father of Pharamund, being king of a body of Franks in Germany <a id="l898"></a>in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius, as above, Pharamund might reign <a id="l899"></a>over the same Franks in Germany before he succeeded Theudemer in the <a id="l900"></a>kingdom of the Salians within the empire, &amp; even before Theudemer began <a id="l901"></a>his reign; suppose in the first year of Honorius, or when those Franks <a id="l902"></a>being repulsed by  Stilico, lost their kings Marcomir &amp; Suno, one of whom <a id="l903"></a>was the father of Pharamund. And the Roman Franks, after the death of <a id="l904"></a>Theudemer, might invite Pharamund with his people  from beyond the <a id="l905"></a>Rhine. But we are not to regard the reign of Pharamund in Germany: <a id="l906"></a>We are to date this kingdom from its rise within the empire, &amp; to look upon <a id="l907"></a>it as strengthened by the access of other Franks coming from beyond the <a id="l908"></a>Rhine, whether in the reign of this king or in that of his successor Clodio. <a id="l909"></a>For in the last year of Pharamund's reign, Ætius took from him a part <a id="l910"></a>of his possession  in Gallia: but his successor Clodio <a id="l911"></a>(whom Fredigarius represents the son of Theudemer, &amp; some call Clogio, <a id="l912"></a>Cloio, &amp; Claudius) inviting from beyond the Rhine a great body of Franks, <a id="l913"></a>recovered all, &amp; carried on their conquests as far as the river <em class="underline">Some</em>.  <a id="l914"></a>Then those Franks dividing conquests with him, erected certain new kingdoms <a id="l915"></a>at Colen &amp; Cambray, &amp; some other cities: all which were afterwards con<a id="l916"></a>quered by Clodovæus, who also drave the Goths out of Gallia, &amp;  fix'd his <a id="l917"></a>seat at Paris, where it has continued ever since. And this was the original <a id="l918"></a>of the present kingdom of France.</p>
<p id="par81">7. The kings of Britain were A.C. 407 or 408, Marcus, Gratian, <a id="l919"></a>&amp; Constantine successively; A.C. 425 Vortigern, 466 Aurelius Ambrosius, <a id="l920"></a>498 Vther Pendraco, 508 Arthur, 542 Constantinus, 545 Aurelius <a id="l921"></a>Cunanus, 578 Vortiporeus, 581 Malgo, 586 Careticus, 613 Cadwan, <a id="l922"></a>635 Cadwalin, 676 Cadwallader: The first three were Roman Tyrants, <a id="l923"></a>who revolted from the empire. Orosius, Prosper &amp; Zosimus connect their <a id="l924"></a>revolt with the irruptions of the barbarians into Gallia, as consequent <a id="l925"></a>thereunto.  Prosper (with whom Zosimus agrees) puts it in the year which <a id="l926"></a>began the day after that irruption. The just time I thus collect: Marcus <a id="l927"></a>reigned not many days, Gratian four months, &amp; Constantine three years. <a id="l928"></a>He was slain the year after the taking of Rome, that is A.C. 411, 14 Kal <a id="l929"></a>Octob. Whence the revolt was in Spring A.C. 408. Sozomen joyns Con<a id="l930"></a>stantine's expedition into Gallia with Arcadius's  death, or the <a id="l931"></a>times a little after, &amp; Arcadius died A.C. 408 May 1<sup>st</sup>. Now tho the reign <a id="l932"></a>of these Tyrants was but short, yet they gave a beginning to the kingdom <a id="l933"></a>of Britain, &amp; so may be reckoned the three first kings, especially since <a id="l934"></a>the posterity of Constantine (viz<sup>t</sup> his sons sons Aurelius Ambrosius, &amp; Vther Pen<a id="l935"></a>draco, &amp; his grandson Arthur) reigned afterwards. For from the time of the <a id="l936"></a>revolt of these tyrants Britain continued a distinct kingdom absolved <a id="l937"></a>from subjection to the Empire, the Emperor not being able to spare soldiers <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021r"> &lt;21r&gt; </span> to be sent thither to receive &amp; keep the Island, &amp; therefore neglecting it; as we learn <a id="l938"></a>by unquestionable records. For Prosper tells us: <em class="underline">A.C. 410, Variane Cos. Hac tem<a id="l939"></a>pestate præ valetudine Romanorum vires funditus attenuatæ Britanniæ</em>. And Sigebert, <a id="l940"></a>conjoining this with the siege of Rome, saith: <em class="underline">Britannorum vires attenuatæ, et <a id="l941"></a>substrahunt se a Romanorum dominatione</em>. And Zosimus lib. 6: <em class="underline">The Transrhe<a id="l942"></a>nane Barbarians invading all  places, reduced the inhabitants of the island <a id="l943"></a>of Britain, &amp; also certain Celtic nations to that pass, that they fell off from the Roman <a id="l944"></a>Empire; &amp; being no longer obedient to the Roman laws</em> κατ᾽ ἑαυτὸν βιατεύειν, <a id="l945"></a><em class="underline">they lived in separate bodies after their own pleasure. Therefore the Britains <a id="l946"></a>taking up arms, &amp; hazarding themselves for their own safety, they freed their <a id="l947"></a>cities from the imminent Barbarians. In like manner all Brabant &amp; some <a id="l948"></a>other Provinces of the Gauls imitating the Britains, freed themselves after <a id="l949"></a>the same manner, ejecting the Roman Presidents, &amp; forming a certain com<a id="l950"></a>mon wealth according to their own pleasure. This rebellion of Britain &amp; the <a id="l951"></a>Celtic nations happened when Constantine usurped the kingdom.</em> So also Pro<a id="l952"></a>copius, lib. 1.  Vandal., speaking of the same Constantine, saith: <em class="underline">Constantine being <a id="l953"></a>overcome in battel, was slain with his children</em>: Βρετταννίαν μέν τοι Ρωμᾶιοι <a id="l954"></a>ἀνασώσασθαι οὐκέτι ἔχον αλλ᾽ οὖσα ὑπὸ <em class="underline">τυραννος</em><sup class="note" id="n41-ref">[41]</sup> ἀπ᾽ ἀυτοῦ ἔμενε: <em class="underline">Yet <a id="l955"></a>the Romans could not recover Britain any more, but from that time it remain<a id="l956"></a>ed under Tyrants.</em> And Beda, (l. 1, c. 11.) <em class="underline">Fracta est Roma a Gothis anno 1164 <a id="l957"></a>suæ conditionis; ex quo tempore Romani in Britannia regnare cessaverunt</em>. <a id="l958"></a>And Ethelwaldus: <em class="underline">A tempore Romæ a Gothis expugnatæ cessavit imperium <a id="l959"></a>Romanorum a Britannia insula, et ab alijs, quas sub jugo</em>  <span class="overline">servi<a id="l960"></a>tutis tenebant, multis terris.</span>  And Theodoret (Serm. 9. de curand. Græc. <a id="l961"></a>affect.) about the year 424, reckons the Britains among the nations which <a id="l962"></a>were not then in subjection to the Roman Empire.  So Sigonius, ad annum <a id="l963"></a>411, <em class="underline">Imperium Romanorum post excessum Constantini in Britannia nullum fuit.</em></p>
<p id="par82">Between the death of Constantine &amp; the reign of Vortigern was an interreg<a id="l964"></a>num of about 14 years, in which the Britains had wars with the Picts &amp; Scots, <a id="l965"></a>&amp; twice obtained the assistance of a Roman Legion, who drove out the <a id="l966"></a>enemy, but told them positively at their departure that they would come no <a id="l967"></a>more. Of Vortigern's beginning to reign there is this record in an old Chro<a id="l968"></a>nicle in Nennius, quoted by Camden &amp; others: <em class="underline">Guortigernus tenuit imperi<a id="l969"></a>um in Britannia, Theodosio &amp; Valentiniano Coss</em> [viz<sup>t</sup> A.C. 425.] <em class="underline">&amp; in quarto <a id="l970"></a>anno regni sui Saxones ad Britanniam venerunt, Fœlice &amp; Tauro Coss.</em> <a id="l971"></a>[viz<sup>t</sup> A.C. 428.] This coming of the Saxons Sigebert referrs to the 4<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l972"></a>of Valentinian, which falls in with the year 428 assigned by this Chronicle: <a id="l973"></a>And two years after, the Saxons together with the Picts were beaten by the Bri<a id="l974"></a>tains. Afterwards in the reign of Martian the Emperor, that is, between the <a id="l975"></a>years 450 &amp; 456, the Saxons under Hengist were called in by the Britains, <a id="l976"></a>but six years after revolted from them, &amp; made war upon them with various <a id="l977"></a>success, &amp; by degrees succeeded them. Yet the Britains continued a flourishing <a id="l978"></a>kingdom till the reign of Careticus; &amp; the war between the two nations<sup><em>a</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n42-ref">[42]</sup> continued <a id="l979"></a>till the reign of Pope Sergius A.C. 688.</p>
<p id="par83">8. The kings of the Hunns were A.C. 406 Octar &amp; Rugila, 433 Bleda <a id="l980"></a>&amp; Attila. Octar &amp; Rugila were the brothers of Munzuc king of the Hunns in <a id="l981"></a>Gothia beyond the Danube, &amp; Bleda &amp; Attila were his sons, &amp; Munzuc was the <a id="l982"></a>son of Balamir. The two first, as Iornandes tells us, were kings of the Hunns, but <a id="l983"></a>not of them all, &amp; had the two last for their successors. I date the reign of the Hunns <a id="l984"></a>in Pannonia from the time that the Vandals &amp; Alans relinquished Pannonia to them, A.C. 407: Sigo<a id="l985"></a>nius from the time that the Visigoths relinquished Pannonia A.C. 408. <em class="underline">Constat</em>, <a id="l986"></a>saith he, <em class="underline">quod Gothis ex Illyrico profectis, Hunni successerunt, atque imprimis <a id="l987"></a>Pannoniam tenuerunt.

Whence it's probable that he became hostage to the Hunns about the <a id="l1002"></a>year 412 or 413, when Honorius made leagues with almost all the barbarous <a id="l1003"></a>nations, &amp; granted them seats. But I had rather say with Sigonius, that Ætius <a id="l1004"></a>became hostage to Alaric A.C. 403. It's further manifest out of  <a id="l1005"></a>Prosper, that the Hunns were in quiet possession of Pannonia in the year 432. <a id="l1006"></a>For in the first book of Eusebius's Chronicle Prosper writes: <em class="underline">Anno decimo <a id="l1007"></a>post obitum Honorij, cum ad Chunnorum gentem cui tunc Rugila præerat; <a id="l1008"></a>post prælium cum Bonifacio se Ætius contulisset, impetrato auxilio ad Ro<a id="l1009"></a>manorum solum regreditur</em>. And in the second book: <em class="underline">Ætio et Valerio Coss: Ætius <a id="l1010"></a>deposita potestate profugus ad Hunnos in Pannonia pervenit, quorum <a id="l1011"></a>amicitia auxilioque usus pacem principum interpellatæ potestatis obtinuit</em>. <a id="l1012"></a>Hereby it appears that at this time Rugila (or as Maximus calls him, <a id="l1013"></a>Rechilla) reigned over the Hunns in Pannonia; &amp; that Pannonia was not <a id="l1014"></a>now so much as accounted within the soil of the Empire, being formerly granted <a id="l1015"></a>away to the Hunns; &amp; that these were the very same body of Hunns with <a id="l1016"></a>which Ætius had, in the time of his being a hostage, contracted friendship: <a id="l1017"></a>by virtue of which, as he sollicited them before to the aid of Iohn the tyrant <a id="l1018"></a>A.C. 424, so now he procured their intercession for himself with the Empe<a id="l1019"></a>ror. Octar died A.C. 430; for Socrates tells us, that <sup class="note" id="n43-ref">[43]</sup>[about that time the Bur<a id="l1020"></a>gundians having been newly vext by the Hunns, upon intelligence of <a id="l1021"></a>Octar's death seeing them without a leader, set upon them suddenly with <a id="l1022"></a>so much <em class="underline">success</em><sup class="note" id="n44-ref">[44]</sup>, that 3000 Burgundians slew 10000 Hunns. Of Rugila's <a id="l1023"></a>being now king in Pannonia you have heard already. He died A.C. 433, &amp; was <a id="l1024"></a>succeeded by Bleda, as Prosper &amp; Maximus inform us. This Bleda with  <a id="l1025"></a>his brother Attila were before this time kings of the Hunns beyond the Danube, <a id="l1026"></a>their father Munzuc's kingdom being divided between them; &amp; now they <a id="l1027"></a>united the kingdom of Pannonia to their own. Whence Paulus Diaconus <a id="l1028"></a>saith, they did <em class="underline">regnum intra Pannoniam Daciamque gerere</em>. In the year 441, they <a id="l1029"></a>began to invade the Empire a fresh, adding to the Pannonian forces new <a id="l1030"></a>&amp; great armies from Scythia. But this war was presently composed. And <a id="l1031"></a>then Attila seing Bleda inclined to peace, slew him A.C. 444, inherited <a id="l1032"></a>his dominions, &amp; invaded the Empire a fresh. At length after various <a id="l1033"></a>great warrs with the Romans, Attila perished A.C. 454; &amp; his sons quar<a id="l1034"></a>relling about his dominions, gave occasion to the Gepides, Ostrogoths &amp; other <a id="l1035"></a>nations who were their subjects, to rebel &amp; make war upon them.  <a id="l1036"></a>The same year the Ostrogoths had seats granted  them in Pannonia, <a id="l1037"></a>by the Emperors Marcian &amp; Valentinian; &amp; with the Romans ejected <a id="l1038"></a>the Hunns out of Pannonia, soon after the death of Attila, as all histo<a id="l1039"></a>rians agree. This ejection was in the reign of Avitus, as is mentioned in <a id="l1040"></a>the Chronicum Boiorum, &amp; in Sidonius, Carm. 7 in Avitum, which speaks <a id="l1041"></a>thus of that Emperor</p>
<div class="lg"><p>— <em class="underline">cujus solum amissas post sæcula multa</em></p> 
<p class="l"><em class="underline">Pannonias revocavit iter, jam credere promptum est</em></p> 
<p class="l"><em class="underline">Quid faciet bellis.</em></p></div>
<p id="par84" class="i0">The Poet means, that by the coming of Avitus the Hunns yielded more <a id="l1042"></a>easily to the Goths. This was written by Sidonius in the beginning of the <a id="l1043"></a>reign of Avitus: And his reign began in the end of the year 455, &amp; lasted <a id="l1044"></a>not one full year.</p>
<p id="par85">Iornandes tells us: <em class="underline">Duodecimo anno regni  Walliæ post pene <a id="l1045"></a>quinquaginta annos invasa Pannonia, Hunni a Romanis &amp; Gothis pulsi sunt</em>. <a id="l1046"></a>And Marcelline: <em class="underline">Hierio et Ardaburio Coss. Pannoniæ quæ per quinquaginta annos ab Hunnis retinebantur, a Romanis receptæ sunt</em>. Whence it <a id="l1048"></a>should seem that the Hunns invaded &amp; held Pannonia from the year 378 <a id="l1049"></a>or 379 to the year 427, &amp; then were driven out of it. But this is a plane <a id="l1050"></a>mistake: For it is certain that the Emperor Theodosius left the Empire <a id="l1051"></a>entire. And we have shewed out of Prosper, that the Hunns were in quiet <a id="l1052"></a>possession of Pannonia in the year 432. The Visigoths in those days <a id="l1053"></a>had nothing to do with Pannonia, &amp; the Ostrogoths continued subject to the <a id="l1054"></a>Hunns till the death of Attila, A.C. 454; &amp; Wallia king of the Visigoths <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023r"> &lt;23r&gt; </span> did not reign twelve years. He began his reign in the end of the year <a id="l1055"></a>415, reigned three years, &amp; was slain A.C. 419, as Idacius, Isidorus, &amp; <a id="l1056"></a>the Spanish manuscript Chronicles seen by Grotius testify. And Olympio<a id="l1057"></a>dorus, who produceth his history only to the year 425, sets down therein <a id="l1058"></a>the death of Valia king of the Visigoths, &amp; conjoins it with that of Con<a id="l1059"></a>stantius which happened A.C. 420. Wherefore the Valia of Iornandes, <a id="l1060"></a>who reigned at the least twelve years, is some other king. And I suspect <a id="l1061"></a>that this name hath been put by mistake for Valamir king of the Ostro<a id="l1062"></a>goths:  For the action recorded was of the Romans &amp; Ostrogoths dri<a id="l1063"></a>ving the Huns out of Pannonia after the death of Attila; And it is not <a id="l1064"></a>likely that the historian would referr the history of the Ostrogoths to the  years of the Visigothic <a id="l1065"></a>kings. This action happened in the end of the year 455, which I take to <a id="l1066"></a>be the twelfth-year of Valamir in Pannonia, &amp; which was almost fifty <a id="l1067"></a>years after the year 406, in which the Hunns succeeded the Vandals &amp; <a id="l1068"></a>Alans in Pannonia. Vpon the ceasing of the line of Hunnimund the son <a id="l1069"></a>of Hermaneric, the Ostrogoths lived without kings of their own nation <a id="l1070"></a>about forty years together, being subject to the Hunns. And when Alaric <a id="l1071"></a>began to make war upon the Romans, which was in the year 444, he <a id="l1072"></a>made Valamir, with his brothers Theodemir &amp; Videmir the grandsons of <a id="l1073"></a>Vinethar, captains or kings of these  Ostrogoths under him. And in <a id="l1074"></a>the twelfth year of Valamir's reign dated from thence, the Hunns <a id="l1075"></a>were driven out of Pannonia.</p>
<p id="par86">Yet the Hunns were not so ejected, but that they had further con<a id="l1076"></a>tests with the Romans, till the head of Denfix the son of Attila, A.C. 469, <a id="l1077"></a>(in the Consulship of Zeno &amp; Marcian as Marcelline relates) was car<a id="l1078"></a>ried to Constantinople. Nor were they yet totally ejected the empire: <a id="l1079"></a>For besides their reliques in Pannonia, Sigonius tells us, that when the <a id="l1080"></a>emperors Marcian &amp; Valentinian granted Pannonia to the Goths, (which <a id="l1081"></a>was in the year 454) they granted part of Illyricum to some <a id="l1082"></a>of the Hunns &amp; Sarmatans. And in the year 526, when the Lombards <a id="l1083"></a>removing into Pannonia made war there with the Gepides, the Avares <a id="l1084"></a>(a part of the Hunns, who had  taken the name of Avares from one <a id="l1085"></a>of their kings) assisted the Lombards in that war; &amp; the Lombards after<a id="l1086"></a>wards, when they went into Italy, left their seats in Pannonia to the <a id="l1087"></a>Avares in recompence of their friendship.  From that time the Hunns <a id="l1088"></a>grew again very powerfull, their kings (whom they called Chagan) <a id="l1089"></a>troubling the empire very much in the reigns of the Emperors Mauri<a id="l1090"></a>tius, Phocas, &amp; Heraclius. And this is the original of the present <a id="l1091"></a>kingdom of Hungary, which from these Avares &amp; other Hunns mixed <a id="l1092"></a>together took the name of Hun-Avaria, &amp; by contraction Hungary.</p>
<p id="par87">9. The Lombards, before they came over the Danube, were command<a id="l1093"></a>ed by two Captains, Ibor &amp; Ayon: after whose death they had kings, Agil<a id="l1094"></a>mundus, Lamisso, Lechu, Hildehoc, Gudehoc, Claffo, Tato, Wacho, Walter, <a id="l1095"></a>Audoin, Alboin, Cleophis, &amp;c. Agilmundus was the son of Ayon; &amp; became <a id="l1096"></a>their king (according to Prosper) in the Consulship of Honorius &amp; Theo<a id="l1097"></a>dosius A.C. 389, &amp; reigned 33 years, according to Paulus Warnefridus, <a id="l1098"></a>&amp; was slain in battel by the Bulgarians. Prosper places his death in the <a id="l1099"></a>Consulship of Marinianus &amp; Asclepiadorus, A.C. 423. Lamisso routed <a id="l1100"></a>the Bulgarians, &amp; reigned three years, &amp; Lechu almost forty. Gudehoc was <a id="l1101"></a>contemporary to Odoacer king of the Heruli in Italy, &amp; led his people <a id="l1102"></a>from Pannonia into Rugia, a country on the north side of Noricum next <a id="l1103"></a>beyond the Danube; from whence Odoacer then carried his people into <a id="l1104"></a>Italy. Tato overthrew the kingdom of the Heruli beyond the Danube.  <a id="l1105"></a>Wacho conquered the Suevians, a kingdom then bounded on the east by Ba<a id="l1106"></a>varia, on the west by France, &amp; on the south by the Burgundians. Audoin <a id="l1107"></a>returned into Pannonia A.C. 526, &amp; there overcame the Gepides. Alboin <a id="l1108"></a>A.C. 551 overthrew the kingdom of the Gepides, &amp; slew their king Chunnimun<a id="l1109"></a>dus:  A.C. 563 he assisted the Greek emperor against Totila king of the Ostro<a id="l1110"></a>goths in Italy; &amp; A.C. 568 led his people out of Pannonia into Lombardy, <a id="l1111"></a>where they reigned till the year 774.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p024r"> &lt;24r&gt; </span>
<p id="par88">According to Paulus Diaconus, the Lombards with many other Gothic nations came <a id="l1112"></a>into the Empire from beyond the Danube in the reign of Arcadius &amp; Honorius, that is, <a id="l1113"></a>between the years 395 &amp; 408. But they might come in a little earlier. For we are <a id="l1114"></a>told that the Lombards, under their captains Ibor &amp; Ayon, beat the Vandals in battel; &amp; <a id="l1115"></a>Prosper placeth this victory in the Consulship of Ausonius &amp; Olybrius, that is, A.C. 379. <a id="l1116"></a>Before this  war the Vandals had remained quiet forty years in the seats granted <a id="l1117"></a> them in Pannonia by Constantine the great. And therefore if these were the same Van<a id="l1118"></a>dals, this war  must have been in Pannonia; &amp; might be occasioned by the coming of the Lombards <a id="l1119"></a>over the Danube into Pannonia a year or two before the battel; &amp;  must have put an end to that <a id="l1120"></a>quiet which had lasted forty years. And after Gratian &amp; Theodosius had quieted the <a id="l1121"></a>barbarians, they might either retire over the Danube, or continue quiet under the <a id="l1122"></a>Romans till the death of Theodosius; &amp; then either invade the Empire anew, or throw <a id="l1123"></a>off all subjection to it. By their warrs, first with the Vandals &amp; then with the Bulgarians, a Scythian <a id="l1124"></a>nation so called from the river Volga whence they came; it appears that even <a id="l1125"></a>in those days they were a kingdom not contemptible.</p>
<p id="par89">10. These nine kingdoms being rent away, we are next to consider the residue <a id="l1126"></a>of the western empire. While this empire continued entire, it was the Beast himself: <a id="l1127"></a>but the residue thereof is  only a part of him. And if this part be considered as a <a id="l1128"></a>horn, the reign of this horn may be dated from the translation of the Imperial <a id="l1129"></a>seat from Rome to Ravenna, which was in October A.C. 408. For then the <a id="l1130"></a>Emperor Honorius, fearing that Alaric would beseige him in Rome if he staid <a id="l1131"></a>there retired to Millain, &amp; thence to Ravenna: &amp; the ensuing siege &amp; sacking <a id="l1132"></a>of Rome confirmed his residence there, so that he &amp; his successors ever after  <a id="l1133"></a>made it their home.  Accordingly Macchiavel in his Florentine history <a id="l1134"></a>writes, that Valentinian having left Rome, translated the seat of the empire to Ravenna.</p>
<p id="par90">Rhætia belonged to the western Emperors so long as that Empire stood; &amp; then <a id="l1135"></a>it descended, with Italy &amp; the Roman Senate, to Odoacer king of the Herulij in <a id="l1136"></a>Italy, &amp; after him to Theoderic king of the Ostrogoths &amp; his successors, by the grant <a id="l1137"></a>of the Greek Emperors. Vpon the death of Valentinian the second, the Ale<a id="l1138"></a>mans &amp; Suevians invaded Rhætia A.C. 455. But I do not find  they erected <a id="l1139"></a>any <em class="underline">standing</em><sup class="note" id="n45-ref">[45]</sup> kingdom there: For in the year 457, while they were yet depo<a id="l1140"></a>pulating Rhætia, they were attacked &amp; beaten by Burto Master of <a id="l1141"></a>the horse to the Emperor Majoranus; &amp; I hear nothing more of their <a id="l1142"></a>invading Rhætia. Clodovæus king of France, in or about the yeare 496, conquered <a id="l1143"></a>a kingdome of the Alemans, &amp; slew their last king Ermeric. But this <a id="l1144"></a>kingdome was seated in Germany, &amp; only bordered upon Rhætia: For <a id="l1145"></a>its people fled from Clodovæus into the neighbouring kingdom of the Os<a id="l1146"></a>trogoths under Theoderic,  who received them as friends, &amp; wrote <a id="l1147"></a> a friendly letter to Clodovæus in their behalf. And by this means they <a id="l1148"></a>became inhabitants of Rhætia, as subjects under the dominion of the <a id="l1149"></a>Ostrogoths.</p>
<p id="par91">When the Greek Emperor conquered the Ostrogoths, he succeeded them <a id="l1150"></a> in the kingdom of Ravenna, not only by right of conquest but also <a id="l1151"></a>by right of inheritance, the Roman Senate <sup class="note" id="n46-ref">[46]</sup>[still going along with this <a id="l1152"></a>kingdom. And therefore we may reccon that this kingdome continued <a id="l1153"></a>in the Exarchate of Ravenna &amp; Senate of Rome. For the remainder <a id="l1154"></a>of the western Empire went along with the Senate of Rome, by reason <a id="l1155"></a>of the right which this Senate still retained, &amp; at length exerted, of <a id="l1156"></a>chusing a new western Emperor.</p>
<p id="par92">I have now enumerated the tenn kingdoms, into which the wes<a id="l1157"></a>tern Empire became divided at its first breaking, that is, at the time of <a id="l1158"></a>Rome's being besieged &amp; taken by the Goths. Some of these kingdoms at <a id="l1159"></a>length fell, &amp; new ones arose: but whatever was their number after<a id="l1160"></a>wards, they are still called the ten kings from their first number.</p>

But it was a kingdom of a different kind from the other <a id="l1178"></a>ten kingdoms, having a life or soul peculiar to it self with eyes <a id="l1179"></a>&amp; a mouth.

<p id="par98">The invocation of the dead, &amp; veneration of their images, being <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span> gradually introduced in the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>,  6<sup>th</sup> &amp; 7<sup>th</sup> centuries, the Greek Emperor <a id="l1209"></a>Philippicus declared against the latter, A.C. 711 or 712. And the Emperor <a id="l1210"></a>Leo Isaurus, to put a stop to it, called a meeting of Counsellors &amp; Bishops<sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> <a id="l1211"></a>in his Palace A.C. 726, &amp; by their advice put out an Edict against that <a id="l1212"></a>worship, &amp; wrote to Pope Gregory  II. that a general Council might <a id="l1213"></a>be called. But the Pope thereupon called a Council at Rome, confirmed the <a id="l1214"></a>worship of Images, excommunicated the Greek Emperor, absolved <a id="l1215"></a>the people from their allegiance, &amp; forbad them to pay tribute, or other<a id="l1216"></a>wise to be obedient to him. And the people of Rome, Campania, Ravenna <a id="l1217"></a>&amp; Pentapolis, with the cities under them, revolted &amp; laid violent hands <a id="l1218"></a>upon their magistrates, killing the Exarch Paul at Ravenna, &amp; laying <a id="l1219"></a>aside Peter Duke of Rome who was become blind. And when Exhilera<a id="l1220"></a>tus Duke of Campania incited the people against the Pope, the Romans <a id="l1221"></a>invaded Campania, &amp; slew him with his son Hadrian. Then a new Exarch, <a id="l1222"></a>Eutychius, coming to Naples, sent some secretly to take away the <a id="l1223"></a>lives of the Pope &amp; the Nobles of Rome: but the plot being discovered, the <a id="l1224"></a>Romans revolted absolutely from the Greek Emperor, &amp; took an oath <a id="l1225"></a>to preserve the life of the Pope, &amp; to defend their state, &amp; be obedient to <a id="l1226"></a>their authority in all things. Thus Rome with its Duchy, including <a id="l1227"></a>part of <em class="underline">Tuscia</em><sup class="note" id="n54-ref">[54]</sup> &amp; part of Campania, revolted in the year 726, &amp; <a id="l1228"></a>became a free state under the government of the  senate of this city. And the autho<a id="l1229"></a>rity of the Senate in civil affairs was  henceforward <a id="l1230"></a>absolute, the authority of the Pope extending hitherto no farther than <a id="l1231"></a>to the affairs of the Church.</p>
<p id="par99">At that time the Lombards<sup class="note" id="n55-ref">[55]</sup> also being zealous for the worship of <a id="l1232"></a>images, &amp; pretending to favour the cause of the Pope, invaded the cities <a id="l1233"></a>of the Exarchate: &amp; at length (viz<sup>t</sup> A.C. 752) they took Ravenna &amp; put <a id="l1234"></a>an end to the Exarchate. And this was the first of the three king<a id="l1235"></a>doms which fell before the little horn.</p>
<p id="par100">In the year 751 Pope Zechary deposed Childeric<sup class="note" id="n56-ref">[56]</sup>, a slothfull <a id="l1236"></a>&amp; useless king of France, &amp; the last of the race of Merovæus; &amp; absolv<a id="l1237"></a>ing his subjects from their oath of allegiance, gave the kingdom to Pipin, <a id="l1238"></a>the Major of the Palace; &amp; thereby made a new &amp; potent friend. And <a id="l1239"></a>his successor Pope Stephen III<sup class="note" id="n57-ref">[57]</sup> knowing better how to deal with the <a id="l1240"></a>Greek Emperor than with the Lombards, went the next year to the <a id="l1241"></a>king of the Lombards, to persuade him to return the Exarchate to the <a id="l1242"></a>Emperor. But this not Succeeding, he went into France, &amp; persuaded <a id="l1243"></a>Pipin to take the Exarchate &amp; Pentapolis from the Lombards, &amp; give <a id="l1244"></a>it to S<sup>t.</sup> Peter. Accordingly Pipin A.C. 754 came with an army <a id="l1245"></a>into Italy, &amp; made Aistulphus king of the Lombards promise the surrender. <a id="l1246"></a>But the next year Aistulphus, on the contrary, to revenge himself on <a id="l1247"></a>the Pope, besieged the city of Rome. Whereupon the Pope sent letters to <a id="l1248"></a>Pipin, wherein he told him that if he came not speedily against the Lom<a id="l1249"></a>bards, <em class="underline">pro data sibi potentia alienandum fore a regno Dei &amp; vita æter<a id="l1250"></a>na</em>, he should be excommunicated. Pipin therefore, fearing a revolt <a id="l1251"></a>of his subjects, &amp; being indebted to the Church of Rome, came speedily <a id="l1252"></a>with an army into Italy, raised the siege, besieged the Lombards in Papia<sup class="note" id="n58-ref">[58]</sup>, <a id="l1253"></a>&amp; forced them to surrender the Exarchate &amp; region of Pentapolis to the <a id="l1254"></a>Pope for a perpetual possession. Thus the Pope became Lord of Ravenna, <a id="l1255"></a>&amp; the Exarchate, some few cities excepted; &amp; the keys were sent to Rome, <a id="l1256"></a>&amp; laid upon the confession of S<sup>t</sup> Peter, that is upon his tomb at the High <a id="l1257"></a>Altar, <em class="underline">in signum veri perpetuique dominij, sed pietate Regis gratuita</em>, as <a id="l1258"></a>the inscription of a coin of Pipin hath it. This was in the year of Christ <a id="l1259"></a>755. And henceforward the Popes being temporal Princes, left off in their <a id="l1260"></a>epistles &amp; Bulls to note the years of the Greek Emperors, as they had hither<a id="l1261"></a>to done.</p>
<p id="par101">After this the Lombards invading the Pope's countries, Pope Adrian<sup class="note" id="n59-ref">[59]</sup> sent to <a id="l1262"></a>Charles the great, the son &amp; successor of Pipin, to come to his assistance. <a id="l1263"></a>Accordingly Charles entered Italy with an army, invaded the Lombards, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027r"> &lt;27r&gt; </span> overthrew their kingdom, became master of their countries, &amp; restored <a id="l1264"></a>to the Pope, not only what they had taken from him, but also the rest <a id="l1265"></a>of the Exarchate which they had promised Pipin to surrender to him, <a id="l1266"></a>but had hitherto detained; &amp; also gave him some cities of the Lombards, &amp; <a id="l1267"></a><sup class="note" id="n60-ref">[60]</sup>was mutually made Patricius by the Romans, &amp; had the authority of con<a id="l1268"></a>firming the elections of the Popes conferred upon him. These things <a id="l1269"></a>were done in the years 773 &amp; 774. And this kingdom of the Lombards was the second kingdom <a id="l1270"></a>which fell before the little horn. But Rome, which was to be the seat of <a id="l1271"></a>his kingdom, was not yet his own.</p>
<p id="par102">In the year 796, Leo III<sup class="note" id="n61-ref">[61]</sup> being made Pope, notified his election <a id="l1272"></a>to Charles the great by his Legates, sending to him for a present, the <a id="l1273"></a>golden keys of the Confession of Peter, &amp; the Banner of the city of Rome: <a id="l1274"></a>the first as an acknowledgment of the Pope's holding the cities of the <a id="l1275"></a>Exarchate &amp; Lombardy by the grant of Charles; the other as a signifi<a id="l1276"></a>cation that Charles should come &amp; subdue the Senate &amp; people of <a id="l1277"></a>Rome, as he had done the Exarchate &amp; the <sup class="note" id="n62-ref">[62]</sup>[kingdom of the Lombards. <a id="l1278"></a>For the Pope at the same time desired Charles to send some of his <a id="l1279"></a>Princes to Rome, who might subject to the Roman people to him, &amp; bind <a id="l1280"></a>them by oath <em class="underline">in fide &amp; subjectione</em>, in fealty &amp; subjection, as his words <a id="l1281"></a>are recited by Sigonius. An anonymous Poet,  published by Boecle<a id="l1282"></a>rus at Strasburg, expresseth it thus:</p>
<div class="lg">
<p class="l">Admonuitque pijs precibus, qui mittere vellet</p>
<p class="l">Ex proprijs aliquos primoribus, ac sibi plebem</p>
<p class="l">Subdere Romanam, servandaque fœdera cogens</p>
<p class="l">Hanc fidei sacramentis promittere magnis.</p>
</div>
<p id="par103">Hence arose a misunderstanding between the Pope &amp; the city. And the <a id="l1283"></a>Romans about two or three years after, by assistance of some of the <a id="l1284"></a>Clergy, raised so great tumults against him, as gave occassion to a <a id="l1285"></a>new state of things in all the West. For two of the Clergy accused <a id="l1286"></a>him of certain crimes, &amp;  with an armed force of the Romans, seized <a id="l1287"></a>him, stript him of his sacerdotal habit, &amp; imprisoned him in a monastery. <a id="l1288"></a>But by assistance of his friends he made his escape, &amp; fled into Germany <a id="l1289"></a>to Charles the great,  to whom he complained   of the Romans for acting <a id="l1290"></a>against him out of a design  to throw off all authority of the Church, <a id="l1291"></a>&amp; to recover their ancient freedom.  In his absence his accusers <a id="l1292"></a>with  their forces ravaged the possessions of the Church, &amp; sent <a id="l1293"></a>the accusations to Charles. And before the end of the year Charles <a id="l1294"></a>sent the Pope back to Rome with a large retinue.  The Nobles &amp; <a id="l1295"></a>Bishops of France who accompanied him, examined the chief of his <a id="l1296"></a>accusers at Rome, &amp; sent them into France in custody. This was in the <a id="l1297"></a>year 799.  The next year Charles himself went to Rome, &amp; upon <a id="l1298"></a>a day appointed presided in a Council of Italian &amp; French Bishops <a id="l1299"></a>to hear both parties. But when the Pope's adversaries expected to be <a id="l1300"></a>heard, the Council declared that he who was the supreme judge<sup class="note" id="n63-ref">[63]</sup> of all <a id="l1301"></a>men, was above being judged by any other than himselfe.  Where<a id="l1302"></a>upon the Pope made a solemn declaration of his innocence before all <a id="l1303"></a>the people, &amp; by doing so was looked upon as acquitted.</p>
<p id="par104"> Soon after,  upon Christmas day,  the people of <a id="l1304"></a>Rome, who had hitherto elected their Bishop, &amp; reckoned that they &amp; their <a id="l1305"></a>Senate inherited the rights of the ancient Senate &amp; people of Rome, voted Charles <a id="l1306"></a>their Emperor, &amp; subjected themselves to him in such manner <a id="l1307"></a>as the old Roman Empire &amp; their Senate were subjected to  the <a id="l1308"></a>old Roman Emperors.  The Pope crowned him, &amp; anointed him with <a id="l1309"></a>holy oil, &amp; worshipped him on his knees after the manner of adoring <a id="l1310"></a>the old Roman Emperors; as the aforesaid Poet thus mentions:</p>
<div class="lg">
<p class="l"><em class="underline">Post laudes igitur dictus et summus eundem</em></p>
<p class="l"><em class="underline">Præsul adoravit, sicut mos debitus olim</em></p>
<p class="l"><em class="underline">Principibus fuit antiquis.</em></p>
</div>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p028r"> &lt;28r&gt; </span>
<p id="par105" class="i0">And the Emperor  on the other hand,<sup class="note" id="n64-ref">[64]</sup> took the following oath to the Pope: <em class="underline">In nomine <a id="l1311"></a>Christi spondeo atque polliceor Ego Carolus Imperator coram Deo et beato <a id="l1312"></a>Petro Apostolo me protectorem ac defensorem fore hujus sanctæ Romanæ <a id="l1313"></a>Ecclesiæ in omnibus utilitatibus quatenus divino fultus fuero adjutorio <a id="l1314"></a>prout sciero poteroque.</em> The Emperor was made Consul of Rome, &amp; <a id="l1315"></a>his son Pipin was crowned king of Italy. And henceforward the Empe<a id="l1316"></a>ror styled himself: <em class="underline">Carolus serenissimus, Augustus, a Deo coronatus, <a id="l1317"></a>magnus, pacificus, Romæ gubernans imperium</em>, or <em class="underline">Imperator Romanorum</em>; <a id="l1318"></a>&amp; was prayed for in the Churches of Rome.  His image was hencefor<a id="l1319"></a>ward put  upon the coins of Rome. And the enemies of the Pope, to the <a id="l1320"></a>number of three hundred Romans &amp; two or three of the Clergy, were <a id="l1321"></a>sentenced to death; &amp; the three hundred Romans were beheaded in <a id="l1322"></a>one day in the Lateran fields; but the Clergy-men at the intercession <a id="l1323"></a>of the Pope were pardoned &amp; banished into France. And thus the right <a id="l1324"></a>of the Roman Emperors, which had hitherto been in the Greek Emperors, <a id="l1325"></a>was by this Act transferred in the west to the kings of France.</p>
<p id="par106">After these things Charles gave the City &amp;  Duchy of Rome<sup class="note" id="n65-ref">[65]</sup> <a id="l1326"></a>to the Pope, subordinately to himself as Emperor of the Romans; spent <a id="l1327"></a>the winter in ordering the affairs of Rome, &amp; those of the Apostolic sea &amp; <a id="l1328"></a>of all Italy, both civil &amp; ecclesiastical, &amp; in making new laws for them; &amp; <a id="l1329"></a>returned the next summer into France: leaving the city under its <a id="l1330"></a>senate, &amp; both under the Pope &amp; himself. And hearing that his new <a id="l1331"></a>laws were not observed by the judges in dictating the law, nor by the <a id="l1332"></a>people in hearing it; &amp; that the great men took servants from free men, <a id="l1333"></a>&amp; from the Churches &amp; Monasteries, to labour in their vineyards, fields, <a id="l1334"></a>pastures &amp; houses, &amp; continued to exact cattel &amp; wine of them, &amp; to <a id="l1335"></a>oppress those that served the Churches: he wrote to his son Pipin to <a id="l1336"></a>remedy these abuses, to take care of the Church, &amp; see that his laws <a id="l1337"></a>be executed.</p>
<p id="par107">Now the Senate &amp; people &amp; principality of Rome I take to be the third <a id="l1338"></a>king whom the little horn overcame &amp; even the chief  of the three. <a id="l1339"></a>For this people elected the Pope  &amp; the Emperor &amp;   now, by electing the Emperor &amp; making him <a id="l1340"></a>Consul, was acknowledged to retain the authority of the old Roman  Senate &amp; people. This city was the Metropolis of the old Roman <a id="l1342"></a>Empire, represented in Daniel by the fourth Beast; &amp; by subduing <a id="l1343"></a>the Senate &amp; people &amp; Duchy, it became the Metropolis of the little <a id="l1344"></a>horn of that Beast, &amp; completed Peter's Patrimony, which was the <a id="l1345"></a>kingdom of that horn. And this victory was attended with greater con<a id="l1346"></a>sequences then  those over the other two kings. For it set up the <a id="l1347"></a>western Empire, which continues to this day. It set up the Pope <a id="l1348"></a>above the judicature of the Roman Senate, &amp; above that of a Council <a id="l1349"></a>of Italian &amp; French Bishops, &amp; even above all humane judicature; <a id="l1350"></a>&amp; gave him the supremacy over the western Churches &amp; their Councills <a id="l1351"></a>in a high degree. It gave him a look more stout then his fellows; so <a id="l1352"></a>that when his new religion began to be established in the minds of <a id="l1353"></a>men, he grappled not only with kings, but even with the western <a id="l1354"></a>emperor himself. It is observable also, that the custom of kissing <a id="l1355"></a>the Pope's feet, an honour superior to that of kings &amp; Emperors, <a id="l1356"></a>began about this time. There are some instances of it in the ninth <a id="l1357"></a>century. Platina tells us, that the feet of Pope Leo IV were kissed <a id="l1358"></a>according to ancient custome by all  who came to him: &amp; some <a id="l1359"></a>say that Leo III began this custome, pretending that his hand was in<a id="l1360"></a>fected by the kiss of a woman. The Popes began also about this time <a id="l1361"></a>to canonize saints, &amp; to grant Indulgences &amp; pardons. And some <a id="l1362"></a>represent that Leo III was the first author of all these things.  <a id="l1363"></a>It is further observable, that Charles the great, between the years <a id="l1364"></a>775 &amp; 796, conquered all Germany from the Rhine &amp; Danube northward <a id="l1365"></a>to the Baltic sea, &amp; eastward to the river Teis; &amp; extended his conquests <a id="l1366"></a>also into Spain as far as to the river Eber: &amp; by these conquests he laid <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p029r"> &lt;29r&gt; </span> the foundation of the new empire; &amp; at the same time he propagated <a id="l1367"></a>the Roman Catholic religion into all his conquests, obliging the Saxons <a id="l1368"></a>&amp; Hunns who were heathens, to receive the Roman faith, &amp; distributing <a id="l1369"></a>his northern conquests into Bishopricks,  granting tithes to the Clergy <a id="l1370"></a>&amp; Peter-pence to the Pope: by all which the Church of Rome was highly <a id="l1371"></a>enlarged, enriched, exalted, &amp; established.</p>
<p id="par108">In a small book printed at Paris 1689,  entituled, <em class="underline">An historical <a id="l1372"></a>dissertation upon some coins of Charles the great, Ludovicus Pius, Lo<a id="l1373"></a>tharius, &amp; their successors, stamped at Rome</em>,<sup class="note" id="n66-ref">[66]</sup> there is a draught of a piece <a id="l1374"></a>of Mosaic work which Pope Leo III caused to be made in his Palace neare <a id="l1375"></a>the Church of Iohn Lateran, in memory of his sending the standard or <a id="l1376"></a>banner of the city of Rome curiously wrought, to Charles the great, <a id="l1377"></a>&amp; which still remained there at the publishing of the said book. In the <a id="l1378"></a>Mosaic work there appeared Peter with three keys in his lap, reaching <a id="l1379"></a>the pallium to the Pope with his right hand, &amp; the banner of the city <a id="l1380"></a>to Charles the great with his left. By the Pope is this inscription, <a id="l1381"></a>SCISSIMVS D.N. LEO PP; by the king this, D.N. CAROLO REGI; &amp; under the <a id="l1382"></a>feet of Peter this, BEATE PETRE, DONA VITAM LEONI PP, ET <a id="l1383"></a>VICTORIAM CAROLO REGI DONA. This Monument gives the title of <a id="l1384"></a>King to Charles, &amp; therefore was erected before he was Emperor. It was <a id="l1385"></a>erected when Peter was reaching the Pallium to the Pope, &amp; the Pope was send<a id="l1386"></a>ing the banner of the city to Charles, that is, A.C. 796. The words above, viz<sup>t</sup> <a id="l1387"></a><em class="underline">Sanctissimus Dominus noster Leo Papa Domino nostro Carolo Regi</em>, relate <a id="l1388"></a>to the message; &amp; the words below, viz<sup>t</sup> <em class="underline">Beate Petre, dona vitam Leoni Papæ <a id="l1389"></a>&amp; victoriam Carolo regi dona</em>, are a prayer that in this undertaking God <a id="l1390"></a>would preserve the life of the Pope, &amp; give victory to the king over the Ro<a id="l1391"></a>mans. The three keys in the lap of Peter signify the keys of the three <a id="l1392"></a>parts of his patrimony, viz<sup>t</sup> that of Rome with its Duchy, which the Pope claimed &amp; was <a id="l1393"></a>conquering, &amp; those of Ravenna with the Exarchate, &amp; of the territories <a id="l1394"></a>taken from the Lombards; both which he had newly conquered. These <a id="l1395"></a>were the three dominions, whose keys were in the lap of S. Peter, &amp; whose <a id="l1396"></a>Crowns are now worn by the Pope, &amp; by the conquest of which he became <a id="l1397"></a>the little horn of the fourth Beast. By Peter's giving the Pallium to <a id="l1398"></a>the Pope with his right hand, &amp; the banner of the city to the king with <a id="l1399"></a>his left, &amp; by naming the Pope before the king in the inscription, may <a id="l1400"></a>be understood that the Pope was then reckoned superior in dignity to the <a id="l1401"></a>kings of the Earth.</p>
<p id="par109">After the death of Charles the great, his son &amp; successor Ludovicus <a id="l1402"></a>Pius, at the request of the Pope<sup><em>a</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n67-ref">[67]</sup>, confirmed the donations of his Grandfather <a id="l1403"></a>&amp; father to the see of Rome. And in the confirmation he names first Rome <a id="l1404"></a>with its Duchy extending into <em class="underline">Tuscia</em><sup class="note" id="n68-ref">[68]</sup> &amp; Campania;  then the Exar<a id="l1405"></a>chate of Ravenna, with Pentapolis; &amp; in the third place, the territories <a id="l1406"></a>taken form the Lombards. These are his three conquests, &amp; he was to <a id="l1407"></a>hold them of the Emperor for the use of the Church <em class="underline">sub integritate</em>, <a id="l1408"></a>entirely, without the Emperor's medling therewith, or with the <a id="l1409"></a>jurisdiction or power of the Pope therein, unless called thereto <a id="l1410"></a>in certain cases. This ratification the Emperor Ludovicus made <a id="l1411"></a>under an oath. And as the king of the Ostrogoths, for acknowledging  that <sup class="note" id="n69-ref">[69]</sup>[he held his kingdom of Italy of the Greek Emperor, stamped the effigies <a id="l1413"></a>of the Emperour on one side of his coins &amp; his own on the Reverse; so the Pope <a id="l1414"></a>made the like acknowledgement to the western Emperor. For the Pope began <a id="l1415"></a>now to coin money, &amp; the coins of Rome are hence forward found with the <a id="l1416"></a>head of the Emperors (Charles, Ludovicus Pius, Lotharius, &amp; their successors) <a id="l1417"></a>on the one side, &amp; the Pope's inscription on the reverse, for many years.</p>

<p id="par111">The granting of this Iurisdiction to the Pope gave occasion <a id="l1449"></a>to several Bishops to write to him for his resolutions upon doubt<a id="l1450"></a>ful cases, &amp; to his answering them by Decretal Epistles. And <a id="l1451"></a>henceforward he gave laws to the western Churches by <a id="l1452"></a>such Epistles.

And <a id="l1493"></a>this he did in the favour of the Council of Alexandria, that <a id="l1494"></a>nothing more should be required of them than to renounce <a id="l1495"></a>their opinions. Pope Damasus is said to have decreed in <a id="l1496"></a>a Roman Council, that tithes &amp; tenths should be paid upon <a id="l1497"></a>pain of an Anathema; &amp; that <em class="underline">Glory be to the father; &amp;c</em> <a id="l1498"></a>should be said or sung at the end of the Psalms. But <a id="l1499"></a>the first Decretal Epistle now extant is this of Siricius <a id="l1500"></a>to Himerius. And by this Epistle the Pope made Himerius his <a id="l1501"></a>Vicar over all Spain for promulging his Decrees, &amp; seing <a id="l1502"></a>them observed. The Bishop of Sevill was also the Pope's Vicar <a id="l1503"></a>sometimes; For Pope Simplicius wrote thus to Zeno Bishop <a id="l1504"></a>of Sevil: <em class="underline">Talibus idcirco gloriantes indicijs, congruum <a id="l1505"></a>duximus vicariâ Sedis nostræ te auctoritate fulciri: <a id="l1506"></a>cujus vigore munitus, Apostolicæ institutionis Decreta, <a id="l1507"></a>vel sanctorum terminos Patrum, nullatenus transcendi <a id="l1508"></a>permittas</em>.

<p id="par114">By the influence of the same Imperial Edict, not only <a id="l1564"></a>Spain &amp; Gallia, but also Illyricum became subject to the Pope. <a id="l1565"></a>Damasus made Ascholius, or Acholius, bishop of Thessalonica the <a id="l1566"></a>Metropolis of Oriental Illyricum, his Vicar for hearing of <a id="l1567"></a>causes; &amp; in the year 382 Acholius being summoned by <a id="l1568"></a>Pope Damasus, came to a Council at Rome.

And the following Popes gave Rufus the successor <a id="l1572"></a>of Anysius, a power of calling Provincial Councils: For in the <a id="l1573"></a>Collections of Holstenius there is an account of a Council of Rome <a id="l1574"></a>convened under Pope Boniface II, in which were produced Letters of <a id="l1575"></a>Damasus, Syricius, Innocent I, Boniface I, &amp; Cælestine Bishops of <a id="l1576"></a>Rome, to Ascholius, Anysius &amp; Rufus, Bishops of Thessalonica: in <a id="l1577"></a>which Letters they commend to them the hearing of causes in Illyricum <a id="l1578"></a>granted by the Lord &amp; the holy Canons to the Apostolick sea  <a id="l1579"></a>thro'out that Province.

<p id="par115">Occidental Illyricum comprehended Pannonia prima &amp; secunda, <a id="l1634"></a>Savia, Dalmatia, Noricum mediterraneum, &amp; Noricum ripense; <a id="l1635"></a>&amp; its Metropolis was Sirmium till Attila destroyed this city. <a id="l1636"></a>Afterwards Laureacum became the Metropolis of Noricum &amp; both <a id="l1637"></a>Pannonias, &amp; Salona the Metropolis of Dalmatia.

The subjection of these Provinces to the <a id="l1642"></a>see of Rome seems to have begun in Anemius, who was <a id="l1643"></a>ordeined bishop of Sirmium by Ambrose bishop of Millain, <a id="l1644"></a>&amp; who in the Council of Aquileia  under Pope Damasus, A.C. 381, <a id="l1645"></a>declared his sentence in these words: <em class="underline">Caput Illyrici non nisi <a id="l1646"></a>civitas Sirmiensis: Ego igitur illius civitatis Episcopus sum.

The next year Anemius <a id="l1649"></a>&amp; Ambrose,  with Valerian bishop of Aquilea,  Acholius <a id="l1650"></a>bishop of Thessalonica  &amp; many others, went to the Council <a id="l1651"></a>of Rome, which met for overruling the Greek Church by the <a id="l1652"></a>majority of votes, &amp; exalting the authority of the Apostolick <a id="l1653"></a>sees as was attempted before in the Council of Serdica.</p>
<p id="par116">Aquileia was the second city of the western Empire, &amp; <a id="l1654"></a> by some called the second Rome.

<p id="par117">The Bishops of Aquileia &amp; Millain created one another; <a id="l1670"></a>&amp; therefore were of equal authority, &amp; alike subject to the <a id="l1671"></a>see of Rome.

<p id="par125">The second &amp; third Empires, represented by the Bear <a id="l1931"></a>&amp; Leopard, are again represented by the Ram &amp; He-Goat; but <a id="l1932"></a>with this difference, that the Ram represents the kingdoms <a id="l1933"></a>of the Medes &amp; Persians from the beginning of the four Empires, <a id="l1934"></a>&amp; the Goat represents the kingdom of the Greeks to the end of <a id="l1935"></a>them.  By this means, under the type of the Ram &amp; He-Goat, <a id="l1936"></a>the times of all four Empires are again described: <em class="underline">I <a id="l1937"></a>lifted up mine eyes</em>, saith Daniel,<sup class="note" id="n95-ref">[95]</sup> <em class="underline">&amp; saw, &amp; behold there stood <a id="l1938"></a>before the river</em> [Vlai] <em class="underline">a Ram which had two horns, &amp; the two <a id="l1939"></a>horns were high, but one was higher than the other, &amp; the <a id="l1940"></a>higher came up last.</em> — <em class="underline">And the Ram having two horns, <a id="l1941"></a>are the kings of Media &amp; Persia</em>: not two persons but two <a id="l1942"></a>kingdoms, the kingdoms of Media &amp; Persia; &amp; the kingdom <a id="l1943"></a>of Persia was the higher horn &amp; came up last. The king<a id="l1944"></a>dom of Persia rose up, when Cyrus having newly conquered <a id="l1945"></a>Babylon, revolted from Darius king of the Medes, &amp; beat him <a id="l1946"></a>at Pasargadæ, &amp; set up the Persians above the Medes. This <a id="l1947"></a>was the horn which came up last. And the horn which came up <a id="l1948"></a>first was the kingdom of the Medes, from the time that Cy<a id="l1949"></a>axeres &amp; Nebuchadnezzar overthrew Niniveh, &amp; shared <a id="l1950"></a>the Empire of the Assyrians between them. The Empires <a id="l1951"></a>of Media &amp; Babylon were contemporary, &amp; rose up together <a id="l1952"></a>by the fall of the Assyrian Empire; &amp; the Prophesy of <a id="l1953"></a>the four Beasts begins with one of them, &amp; that of the <a id="l1954"></a>Ram &amp; He-Goat with the other. And as the Ram represents <a id="l1955"></a>the kingdom of Media &amp; Persia from the beginning of <a id="l1956"></a>the four Empires; so the He-Goat represents the Empire <a id="l1957"></a>of the Greeks to the end of those Monarchies. In the reign <a id="l1958"></a>of his  great horn, &amp; of the four horns which <a id="l1959"></a>succeeded it, he represents this Empire during the reign <a id="l1960"></a>of the Leopard: &amp; in the reign of his little horn, which <a id="l1961"></a>stood up in the latter time of the kingdom of the four, &amp;  after their <a id="l1962"></a>fall became mighty but not by his  own power, he <a id="l1963"></a>represents it during the reign of the fourth Beast.</p>
<p id="par126"><em class="underline">The rough Goat</em>, saith Daniel, <em class="underline">is the king of Greece</em>, <a id="l1964"></a>that is, the kingdom; <em class="underline">&amp; the great horn between his eyes <a id="l1965"></a>is the first king</em>: not the first Monarch, but the first kingdom, <a id="l1966"></a>that which lasted during the reign of Alexander the great, <a id="l1967"></a>&amp; his brother Aridæus &amp; two young sons, Alexander &amp; <a id="l1968"></a>Hercules. <em class="underline">Now that</em> [horn] <em class="underline">being broken off, whereas four</em> <a id="l1969"></a>[horns] <em class="underline">stood up for it; four kingdoms shall stand up out <a id="l1970"></a>of the nation</em> [of the Greeks], <em class="underline">but not in his</em> [the first horn's] <a id="l1971"></a><em class="underline">power</em>. The four horns are therefore four kingdoms; &amp; by <a id="l1972"></a>consequence, the first great horn which they succeeded is <a id="l1973"></a>the first great kingdom of the Greeks, that which was <a id="l1974"></a>founded by Alexander the great, An. Nabonass. 414, &amp; lasted <a id="l1975"></a>till the death of his Son Hercules An. Nabonass. 441. And the <a id="l1976"></a>four are those of Cassander, Lysimachus, Antigonus, &amp; <a id="l1977"></a>Ptolomy, as above.</p>
<p id="par127"><em class="underline">And in the latter time of their kingdome, when the <a id="l1978"></a>transgressors are come to the full, a king</em> [or new kingdom] <em class="underline">of</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p041r"> &lt;41r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">fierce countenance, &amp; understanding dark sentences, shall <a id="l1979"></a>stand up: And his power shall be mighty, but not by his <a id="l1980"></a>own power</em>. This king was the last horn of the Goat, the <a id="l1981"></a>little horn which came up out of the four horns, <a id="l1982"></a>&amp; waxed exceeding great.  The latter time of their <a id="l1983"></a>kingdom  was when the Romans began to conquer them, <a id="l1984"></a>that is, when they conquered Perseus king of Macedonia, the <a id="l1985"></a>fundamental kingdom of the Greeks. And at that time <a id="l1986"></a>the transgressors came to the full: For then the High-<a id="l1987"></a>priesthood was exposed to sale,  the Vessels of the Temple <a id="l1988"></a>were sold to pay for the purchase; &amp; the High-priest, with <a id="l1989"></a>some of the Iews, procured a licence from  Anti<a id="l1990"></a>ochus Epiphanes to do after the ordinances of the heathen, <a id="l1991"></a>&amp; set up a school at Ierusalem for teaching those <a id="l1992"></a>ordinances. Then Antiochus took Ierusalem with an <a id="l1993"></a>armed force, slew 4000 Iews, took as many prisoners <a id="l1994"></a>&amp; sold them, spoiled the Temple, interdicted the wor<a id="l1995"></a>ship, commanded the Law of Moses to be burnt, &amp; set <a id="l1996"></a>up the worship of the heathen Gods in all Iudea.  In <a id="l1997"></a>the very same year (An. Nabonass. 580) the Romans conquered <a id="l1998"></a>Macedonia, the chief of the four horns. Hitherto the Goat <a id="l1999"></a> was mighty by its own power, but hence forward <a id="l2000"></a>began to be under the Romans.  Daniel distinguishes the <a id="l2001"></a>times, by describing very particularly the actions of the kings <a id="l2002"></a>of the north &amp; south, (those two of the four horns which bordered <a id="l2003"></a>upon Iudea) untill the Romans  conquered Macedonia, <a id="l2004"></a>&amp; thenceforward only touching upon the main revolutions <a id="l2005"></a>which happened within the compass of the nations repre<a id="l2006"></a>sented by the Goat.  In this latter period of time the <a id="l2007"></a>little horn was to stand up &amp; grow mighty, but not by his <a id="l2008"></a>own power.</p>
<p id="par128">The three first of Daniel's Beasts had their dominions <a id="l2009"></a>taken away, each of them at the rise of the  next Beast; <a id="l2010"></a>but their lives were prolonged, &amp; they are all of them <a id="l2011"></a>still alive. The third Beast, or Leopard, reigned in his <a id="l2012"></a>four heads, till the rise of the fourth Beast or Empire <a id="l2013"></a>of the <em class="underline">Latins</em>; &amp; his life was prolonged under their <a id="l2014"></a>power. This Leopard reigning in his four heads, signifies <a id="l2015"></a>the same thing with the He-goat reigning in his four <a id="l2016"></a>horns: &amp; therefore the He-goat reigned in his four <a id="l2017"></a> horns till the rise of Daniel's fourth Beast, or <a id="l2018"></a>Empire of the Latins:  then its dominion was <a id="l2019"></a>taken away by the Latins, but its life was prolonged <a id="l2020"></a>under their power. The Latines are not comprehended <a id="l2021"></a>among the nations represented by the He-Goat in this <a id="l2022"></a>Prophecy: Their power over the Greeks is only named <a id="l2023"></a>in it to distinguish the times in which the He-Goat was <a id="l2024"></a>mighty by his power, from the times in which he <a id="l2025"></a>was mighty but not by his own power. He was mighty <a id="l2026"></a>by his own power till his dominion was taken away <a id="l2027"></a>by the Latines; &amp; after that, his life was prolonged under <a id="l2028"></a>their dominion, &amp; this prolonging of his life was in the <a id="l2029"></a>days of his last horn: For in the days of this horn the <a id="l2030"></a>Goat became mighty but not by his own power.</p>
<p id="par129">Now because this horn was a horn of the Goat, we <a id="l2031"></a>are to look for it amongst the nations which composed the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p042r"> &lt;42r&gt; </span> body of the Goat. Among those nations he was to rise up &amp; grow <a id="l2032"></a>mighty: He grew mighty <sup class="note" id="n96-ref">[96]</sup><em class="underline">towards the south &amp; towards the east &amp; <a id="l2033"></a>towards the pleasant land</em>; &amp; therefore he was to rise up in <a id="l2034"></a>the north-west parts of those nations, &amp; extend his dominion <a id="l2035"></a>towards Egypt,  Syria &amp; Iudea. In the latter time of the king<a id="l2036"></a>dom of the four horns, it was to rise up out of one of them <a id="l2037"></a>&amp; subdue the rest, but not by its own power. It was to be assisted <a id="l2038"></a>by a foreign power, a power superior to it self, the power which <a id="l2039"></a>took away the dominion of the third Beast, the power of the fourth <a id="l2040"></a>Beast. And such a little horn was the kingdom of Macedon from <a id="l2041"></a>the time that it became subject to the Romans. This kingdom by <a id="l2042"></a>the victory of the Romans over Perseus king of Macedon, Anno Nabonass 580, ceased <a id="l2043"></a>to be one of the four horns of the Goat, &amp; became a dominion of <a id="l2044"></a>a new sort; not a horn of the fourth Beast, for Macedon be<a id="l2045"></a>longed to the body of the third: but a horn of the third Beast <a id="l2046"></a>of a new sort, a horn of the Goat which grew mighty but not <a id="l2047"></a>by his own power, a horn which rose up &amp; grew potent under a <a id="l2048"></a>forreign power, the power of the Romans.</p>
<p id="par130">The Romans, by the legacy of Attalus the last king of <a id="l2049"></a>Pergamus, An. Nabonass. 615, inherited that kingdom, including <a id="l2050"></a>all Asia minor on this side mount Taurus:  An. Nabonass. <a id="l2051"></a>, 684 &amp; 685 they conquered Armenia, Syria &amp; Iudæa;  An. <a id="l2052"></a>Nabonass. 718, they subdued Egypt. And by these conquests <a id="l2053"></a>the little <sup class="note" id="n97-ref">[97]</sup>[horn <em class="underline">waxed exceeding great towards the south, <a id="l2054"></a>&amp; towards the east, &amp; towards the pleasant land. And it <a id="l2055"></a>waxed great even to the host of heaven; &amp; cast down of the <a id="l2056"></a>Host &amp; of the starrs to the grownd, &amp; stamped upon them,</em><sup class="note" id="n98-ref">[98]</sup> <a id="l2057"></a>that is, upon the people &amp; great men of the Iews. <sup class="note" id="n99-ref">[99]</sup><em class="underline">Yea, he <a id="l2058"></a>magnified himself even to the Prince of the Host</em>, the <a id="l2059"></a>Messiah, the Prince of the Iews, whom he put to death An. <a id="l2060"></a>Nabonass. 780. <em class="underline">And by him the daily sacrifice was taken <a id="l2061"></a>away, &amp; the place of his Sanctuary was cast down</em>; viz<sup>t</sup> <a id="l2062"></a>in the warrs which the armies of the eastern nations under <a id="l2063"></a>the conduct of the Romans made against Iudea, when <a id="l2064"></a>Nero &amp; Vespasian were Emperors, An. Nabonass. 816, 817, <a id="l2065"></a>&amp; 818. <em class="underline">And an host was given him against the daily sa<a id="l2066"></a>crifice by reason of transgression, &amp; it cast down the truth <a id="l2067"></a>to the grownd, &amp; it practised &amp; prospered.</em><sup class="note" id="n100-ref">[100]</sup> This transgressi<a id="l2068"></a>on is in the next words called <em class="underline">the transgression of desolation;</em> <a id="l2069"></a>&amp; in Dan. XI.31 <em class="underline">the abomination</em>  <em class="underline">which maketh <a id="l2070"></a>desolate</em>; &amp; in Matth. XXIV.15 <em class="underline">the abomination of desolation,</em> <a id="l2071"></a><em class="underline">spoken of by</em> Daniel <em class="underline">the Prophet,</em> <em class="underline">standing in the holy place.</em> <a id="l2072"></a> It may relate chiefly to the worship of Iupiter Olym<a id="l2073"></a>pius in his Temple built  by the Emperor Hadrian, in <a id="l2074"></a>the place of the Temple of the Iews, &amp; to the revolt of <a id="l2075"></a>the Iews under Barchochab occasioned thereby, &amp; to the <a id="l2076"></a>desolation of  Iudæa which followed thereupon, all <a id="l2077"></a>the Iews being thenceforward banished Iudæa upon pain of <a id="l2078"></a>death. <em class="underline">Then I heard,</em> saith Daniel<sup class="note" id="n101-ref">[101]</sup>, <em class="underline">one saint speaking, &amp; <a id="l2079"></a>another saint said to him that spoke, How long shall be the <a id="l2080"></a>vision concerning the daily sacrifice, &amp; the transgression of <a id="l2081"></a>desolation, to give both the sanctuary &amp; the Host to be trodden <a id="l2082"></a>under feet? And he said unto me, <a id="l2083"></a>Vnto two thousand &amp; three <a id="l2084"></a>hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</em> Daniel's days <a id="l2085"></a>are years; &amp; these years may perhaps be  recconed either <a id="l2086"></a>from the destruction of the Temple by the Romans in the reign <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p043r"> &lt;43r&gt; </span> of Vespasian, or from the pollution of the Sanctuary by <a id="l2087"></a>the worship of Iupiter Olympius, or from the desolation of <a id="l2088"></a>Iudea made in the end of the Iewish war by the banishment <a id="l2089"></a>of all the Iews out of their own country, or from some other <a id="l2090"></a>period which time will discover. Henceforward the last horn of the <a id="l2091"></a>Goat continued mighty under the Romans, till the reign of <a id="l2092"></a>Constantine the great &amp; his sons: And then by the division <a id="l2093"></a>of the Roman Empire between the Greek &amp; Latin Empires, <a id="l2094"></a>it separated from the Latins, &amp; became the Greek Em<a id="l2095"></a>pire alone, but yet under the dominion of a Roman <a id="l2096"></a>family; &amp; at present it is mighty under the dominion of <a id="l2097"></a>the Turks.</p>
<p id="par131">This last horn is by some taken for Antiochus Epiphques, <a id="l2098"></a>but not very judiciously. A horn of a Beast is never taken <a id="l2099"></a>for a single person: It always signifies a new kingdom, <a id="l2100"></a>&amp; the kingdom of Antiochus was an old one. Antiochus <a id="l2101"></a>reigned over one of the four horns, &amp; the little horn <a id="l2102"></a>was a fifth under its proper kings. This horn was at <a id="l2103"></a>first a little one, &amp; waxed exceeding great,  &amp; so did not Antiochus. It is described <a id="l2105"></a>great above all the former horns, &amp; so was not Antio<a id="l2106"></a>chus. His kingdom on the contrary was weak, &amp; tri<a id="l2107"></a>butary to the Romans, &amp; he did not enlarge it. The <a id="l2108"></a>horn was a <em class="underline">king of fierce countenance, &amp; destroyed <a id="l2109"></a>wonderfully, &amp; prospered &amp; practised</em>; that is, he prospered in his <a id="l2110"></a>practises against the holy people: but Antiochus was <a id="l2111"></a>frighted out of Egypt by a mere message of the Romans, <a id="l2112"></a>&amp; afterwards routed &amp; baffled by the Iews. The horn was <a id="l2113"></a>mighty by another's power, Antiochus acted by his own. <a id="l2114"></a>The Horn stood up against the Prince of the Host of <a id="l2115"></a>heaven, the Prince of Princes; &amp; this is the character <a id="l2116"></a>not of Antiochus but of Antichrist. The Horn cast down <a id="l2117"></a>the Sanctuary to the grownd, &amp; so did not Antiochus; <a id="l2118"></a>He left it standing. The Sanctuary &amp; Host were <a id="l2119"></a>trampled under foot 2300 days; &amp; in Daniel's pro<a id="l2120"></a>phesies days are put for years: but the profana<a id="l2121"></a>tion of the Temple in the reign of Antiochus did <a id="l2122"></a>not last so many natural days. These were to last <a id="l2123"></a>till the time of the end, till the last end of the In<a id="l2124"></a>dignation against the Iews; &amp; this Indignation is not <a id="l2125"></a>yet at an end. They were to last till the Sanctuary <a id="l2126"></a>which had been cast down should be cleansed, &amp; the <a id="l2127"></a>Sanctuary is not yet cleansed.</p>
<p id="par132">This Prophesy of the Ram &amp; He-Goat is repeated <a id="l2128"></a>in the last Prophesy of Daniel. There the Angel tells <a id="l2129"></a>Daniel<sup class="note" id="n102-ref">[102]</sup>, that <em class="underline">he stood up to strengthen Darius the Mede, <a id="l2130"></a>&amp; that there should stand up yet three kings in Persia,</em> <a id="l2131"></a>[Cyrus, Cambyses, &amp; Darius Hystaspis] <em class="underline">&amp; the fourth</em> <a id="l2132"></a>[Xerxes] <em class="underline">should be far richer then they all; &amp; by his <a id="l2133"></a>wealth thro' his riches he should stir up all against <a id="l2134"></a>the realm of Greece.</em> This relates to the Ram, whose <a id="l2135"></a>two horns were the kingdoms of Media &amp; Persia. Then <a id="l2136"></a>he goes on to describe<sup class="note" id="n103-ref">[103]</sup> the horns of the Goat by the <em class="underline">stand<a id="l2137"></a>ing up of a mighty king, which should rule with great <a id="l2138"></a>dominion, &amp; do so according to his will</em>; &amp; by the breaking <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p044r"> &lt;44r&gt; </span> of his kingdom into four smaller kingdoms, &amp; not to his <a id="l2139"></a>posterity. Then he describes the actions of two of those king<a id="l2140"></a>doms which bordered upon Iudea, viz<sup>t</sup>  <a id="l2141"></a>Egypt &amp; Syria, calling them the kings of the south &amp; north, <a id="l2142"></a>that is, in respect of Iudea; &amp; he carries on the description till <a id="l2143"></a>the latter end of the kingdom of the four, &amp; till the reign of <a id="l2144"></a>Antiochus Epiphanes, when transgressors were come to the <a id="l2145"></a>full.  In the eighth yeare of Antiochus, the year in <a id="l2146"></a>which  he    prophaned the Temple &amp; set up the heathen Gods in all Iudæa, &amp; the Romans conquered <a id="l2147"></a>the kingdom of Macedon, the prophetic Angel leaves off describing the affairs <a id="l2148"></a>of the kings of the South &amp; north, &amp; begins to describe those <a id="l2149"></a> of the Greeks under the dominion of the Romans, <a id="l2150"></a>in these words. And after him<sup class="note" id="n104-ref">[104]</sup> <em class="underline">Arms</em> [The Romans] <em class="underline">shall <a id="l2151"></a>stand up, &amp; they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength</em> <a id="l2152"></a>As ממלך signifies <em class="underline">after the king</em>, Dan XI.8; so here ממנו <a id="l2153"></a>may signify <em class="underline">after him</em>: &amp; so תן־האחת may signify <a id="l2154"></a><em class="underline">after one of them</em>, Dan. VIII.9. Arms are every where in <a id="l2155"></a>these prophesies of Daniel put for the military power of <a id="l2156"></a>a kingdom, &amp; they stand up when they conquer &amp; grow <a id="l2157"></a>powerfull. The Romans conquered Illyricum, Epire &amp; Mace<a id="l2158"></a>don, in the year of Nabonassar 580; &amp; 35 years after, by the <a id="l2159"></a>last will &amp; testament Attalus the last king of Pergamus, <a id="l2160"></a>they inherited that rich &amp; flourishing kingdom, that is, all <a id="l2161"></a>Asia on this side mount Taurus: &amp; 69 years after, they con<a id="l2162"></a>quered the kingdom of Syria, &amp; reduced it into a Province: &amp; <a id="l2163"></a>34 years after they did the like to Egypt.  By all these <a id="l2164"></a>steps the Roman arms stood up over the Greeks. And after <a id="l2165"></a>95 years more,  by making war upon the Iews, <em class="underline">they <a id="l2166"></a>polluted the sanctuary of strength, &amp; took away the dayly <a id="l2167"></a>sacrifice, &amp;</em> [in its room soon after they] <em class="underline">placed the abomi<a id="l2168"></a>nation which made</em> [the Land] <em class="underline">desolate.</em> For this abo<a id="l2169"></a>mination was placed after the days of Christ, Matth. <a id="l2170"></a>XXIV.15. In the 16<sup>th</sup> year of the Emperor Hadrian, <a id="l2171"></a>A.C. 132, they placed this abomination by building a <a id="l2172"></a>Temple to Iupiter Capitolinus, where the Temple of <a id="l2173"></a>God in Ierusalem had stood.  Thereupon the Iews <a id="l2174"></a>under the conduct of Barchochab rose up in arms <a id="l2175"></a>against the Romans, &amp; in the war had 50 cities demolish<a id="l2176"></a>ed, &amp; 985 of their best towns destroyed, &amp; 580000 men <a id="l2177"></a>slain by the sword: &amp; in the end of the war, A.C. 136, they <a id="l2178"></a>were banished Iudea upon pain of death; &amp; thencefor<a id="l2179"></a>ward the land hath remained desolate of its old inhabitants.</p>
<p id="par133">Now that the prophetic Angel passes in this manner <a id="l2180"></a>from the four kingdoms of the Greeks to the Romans reign<a id="l2181"></a>ing over the Greeks, is confirmed  from hence, that in the <a id="l2182"></a>next place he describes the affairs of the Christians unto the <a id="l2183"></a>time of the end, in these words:<sup class="note" id="n105-ref">[105]</sup> <em class="underline">And they that understand <a id="l2184"></a>among the people shall instruct many, yet they shall fall <a id="l2185"></a>by the sword &amp; by flame,  by captivity &amp; by spoile many days. <a id="l2186"></a>Now when they shall fall they shall be holpen with a little <a id="l2187"></a>help,</em> [viz<sup>t</sup> in the reign of Constantine the great,] <em class="underline">but many shall <a id="l2188"></a>cleave to them with  dissimulation.

<p id="par134">The Vision of the Image composed of four metals was given first to <em class="underline">Nebuchad<a id="l2195"></a>nezzar</em>, and then to <em class="underline">Daniel</em> in a dream: and <em class="underline">Daniel</em> began then to be celebrated <a id="l2196"></a>for revealing of secrets, <em class="underline">Ezek.

<p id="par159">The same thing I gather also thus. Cambyses began <a id="l2530"></a>his reign spring I.P. 4185, &amp; reigned 8 years, including the <a id="l2531"></a> five months of Smerdes; &amp; then Darius Hystaspis <a id="l2532"></a>began in spring  I.P. 4193, &amp; reigned 36 <a id="l2533"></a>years, by the unanimous consent of all Chronologers. <a id="l2534"></a>The reigns of these  two kings are determined by <a id="l2535"></a>three eclipses of the moon observed at Babylon, &amp; recorded by Ptolomy; so that  it cannot <a id="l2536"></a>be disputed. One was  in the 7<sup>th</sup> year of Cambyses, an. <a id="l2537"></a> I.P. 4191, Iul. 16,  at 11 <a id="l2538"></a> at night;  another in the 20<sup>th</sup> <a id="l2539"></a>year of Darius, I.P. 4212, Nov. 19, at 11<sup>h.</sup> 45′  at night; <a id="l2540"></a>a third in the 31<sup> st</sup> year of Darius, I.P. 4223, Apr. <a id="l2541"></a>25, at 11<sup>h.</sup> 30′ at night. By these eclipses, &amp; the <a id="l2542"></a>Prophesies of Haggai &amp; Zechary compared together, it's <a id="l2543"></a>manifest that his years began after the 24<sup>th</sup> day of <a id="l2544"></a>the 11<sup>th</sup>  Iewish month, &amp; before the 25<sup>t</sup> day <a id="l2545"></a>of April, &amp; by consequence about March. <a id="l2546"></a> Xerxes therefore began in spring I.P. 4229: for <a id="l2547"></a> Darius died in the fifth year after the battel at Mara<a id="l2548"></a>thon (as Herodotus lib. 7, &amp; Plutarch mention) &amp; that battel <a id="l2549"></a>was in October I.P. 4224, ten years before the  <a id="l2550"></a>battel at Salamis.  Xerxes there<a id="l2551"></a>fore began within less than a year after October I.P. 4228, <a id="l2552"></a>suppose in the spring following: For he spent his first <a id="l2553"></a>five years, &amp; something more, in preparations for <a id="l2554"></a>his  expedition against the Greeks; &amp; this expedi<a id="l2555"></a>tion was in the time of the Olympic games, an. 1 Olymp. <a id="l2556"></a>75, Calliade Athenis Archonte,  28 years after the <a id="l2557"></a>Regifuge, &amp; Consulship of the first Consul Iunius Brutus, <a id="l2558"></a>anno Vrbis conditæ 273, Fabio &amp; Furio Coss. The passage <a id="l2559"></a>of  Xerxes's army over the hellespont began in the  end of <a id="l2560"></a>the fourth year of the 74<sup>th</sup> Olympiad,  (that is, in <a id="l2561"></a>Iune I.P. 4234) &amp; took up one month; &amp; in autumn, <a id="l2562"></a>after three months more, die Munychionis 16 Plenilunio was the <a id="l2563"></a>battel at Salamis, &amp; a little after that an Eclips of <a id="l2564"></a>the sun, which by the calculation fell on Octob. 2.  His <a id="l2565"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p054r"> &lt;54r&gt; </span> sixth year therefore began a little before Iune <a id="l2566"></a>(suppose in  spring)  an. I.P. 4234 &amp; his first year in spring I.P. 4229, as above. Now <a id="l2567"></a>he reigned almost 21 years, by the consent of <a id="l2568"></a>all writers.  Add the seven months <a id="l2569"></a>of Artabanus, &amp; the summ will be 21 years &amp; <a id="l2570"></a> about 4  or 5 months, which end  <a id="l2571"></a> between midsummer &amp; autumn <a id="l2572"></a>I.P. 4250.  At this time there<a id="l2573"></a>fore begins the reign of his successor Artaxerxes, as was to be <a id="l2574"></a>proved. </p>
<p id="par160">The same thing is also confirmed by Iulius <a id="l2575"></a>Africanus, who informs us out of former writers, <a id="l2576"></a>that the 20<sup>th</sup> year of this <em class="underline"> Artaxerxes</em><sup class="note" id="n127-ref">[127]</sup> was the 115<sup>th</sup> <a id="l2577"></a>year from the  beginning of Cyrus in Persia, <a id="l2578"></a>&amp; fell in with an. 4 Olymp. 83.

So soon as the winter was over, &amp; the weather <a id="l2657"></a>became warm enough,  we may reccon that Iohn <a id="l2658"></a>began to baptize; &amp; that before next winter his fame went <a id="l2659"></a>abroad, &amp; all the people came to his baptism, &amp; Iesus among the <a id="l2660"></a>rest. Whence the first Passover after his baptism  mentioned <a id="l2661"></a>Iohn 2.13. was in the 16<sup>th</sup> year of Tiberius. After this feast <a id="l2662"></a>Iesus came into the land of Iudea, &amp; staid there baptizing, <a id="l2663"></a>whilst Iohn was baptizing in Enon, (Iohn 3.22) But when he <a id="l2664"></a>heard that Iohn was cast into prison, he departed in Galilee, <a id="l2665"></a>(Mat 3.12) being afraid, because he  Pharisees had heard <a id="l2666"></a>that he baptized more disciples than Iohn, (Iohn 4.1.) &amp; in <a id="l2667"></a>his journey he passed thro' Samaria four months before the <a id="l2668"></a>harvest  (Iohn 4.35) that is,  about the <a id="l2669"></a> time of the winter Solstice.

This is the beginning of his <a id="l2792"></a>miracles in Galile; &amp; thus far Iohn is full &amp; distinct in relating <a id="l2793"></a>the actions of his first year, omitted by the other evangelists. <a id="l2794"></a> The rest of his history is  from <a id="l2795"></a>this time related more fully by the other evangelists then by <a id="l2796"></a>Iohn; For what they relate he omitts.</p>
<p id="par168">From this time therefore Iesus tought in the  Synagogues of Galilee <a id="l2797"></a>on the Sabbath-days, being glorified of all: &amp; coming to his own city Nazareth,  &amp; <a id="l2798"></a>preaching  in their synagogue, they were offended, &amp; thrust <a id="l2799"></a>him out of the city, &amp; led him to the brow of the hill on which the <a id="l2800"></a>city was built to cast him headlong; but he passing thro' the <a id="l2801"></a>midst of them, went his way, &amp; came &amp; dwelt at Capernaum, <a id="l2802"></a> Luke 4.

All this was done <a id="l2813"></a>before the sermon in the mount: &amp; therefore we may certainly <a id="l2814"></a>reccon that the second Passover was past before the preaching of that <a id="l2815"></a>Sermon  <span class="ns">☉</span><sup class="note" id="n136-ref">[136]</sup> [Let us see therefore how the rest of the feasts <a id="l2828"></a>follow in order in Matthew's Gospel: For he was an eye-witness of <a id="l2829"></a>what he relates, &amp; so tells all things in due order of <a id="l2830"></a>time, which Mark &amp; Luke do not.</p>

<p id="par171">After this Christ did many miracles, &amp; went about all the cities <a id="l2851"></a>&amp; villages of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues &amp; healing <a id="l2852"></a>diseases, Mat. 9. &amp; sent forth the twelve  to do the like, Mat 10. &amp; then  departed <a id="l2854"></a>again to do the same in their cities:  &amp; at length when he had received  a <a id="l2855"></a>message from Iohn &amp; answered it,   <a id="l2856"></a> he said to the multitudes,   <em class="underline">From the days <a id="l2857"></a>of Iohn the Baptist untill now the kingdom of heaven suffereth <a id="l2858"></a>violence</em>;   &amp; upbraided the cities <a id="l2859"></a>(Chorazin, Bethsaida, &amp; Capernaum) wherein most of his <a id="l2860"></a>mighty works were done, because they repented not, Mat. 11. <a id="l2861"></a>Both which passages shew, that from the  imprisonment of Iohn till now <a id="l2862"></a>there  was  a considerable length <sup class="note" id="n139-ref">[139]</sup>of time past. For now the <a id="l2863"></a>winter was past, &amp; the next Passover was at hand. For imme<a id="l2864"></a>diately after this, Matthew (in Chap 12) subjoyns, that  Iesus went <a id="l2865"></a>on the Sabbath thro' the corn, &amp; his disciples were an <a id="l2866"></a>hungred, &amp; began to pluck the ears of corn &amp; to eat, rubbing <a id="l2867"></a>it, saith Luke, with their hands. So then the corn now was <a id="l2868"></a>not only in the ear, but ripe: &amp;  therefore <a id="l2869"></a>the Passover, in which the first-fruits were always offered before the <a id="l2870"></a>harvest, was now come or past. Luke calls this  <a id="l2871"></a>sabbath δευτερόπρωτον, the second prime sabbath, that is, <a id="l2872"></a>the second of the two great feasts of the passover. As we <a id="l2873"></a>call Easter day high Easter, &amp; it octave low Easter or <a id="l2874"></a>lowsunday: so Luke calls the feast on the seventh day of unlevened <a id="l2875"></a>bread the second of the two prime sabbaths.</p>
<p id="par172">In one  of the sabbaths following he went into a synagogue, <a id="l2876"></a>&amp; healed a man with a withered hand, Mat 12.9. Luke 6.6. And <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p060r"> &lt;60r&gt; </span> when the Pharisees took counsel to destroy him, he w<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ithdrew<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l2877"></a>himself from thence, &amp;  great multitudes followed him; &amp; he <a id="l2878"></a>healed them all,  but charged them that they should not make <a id="l2879"></a>him known, Mat. 12.14. Afterwards being in a ship,  &amp; the <a id="l2880"></a>multitude standing on the shore, he spake to them three parables <a id="l2881"></a>together,   taken from the seedsmen sowing  the <a id="l2882"></a>fields, (Matt. 13:) by which you may know that it was now seed-time, <a id="l2883"></a>&amp; by consequence that the feast of tabernacles was past. <a id="l2884"></a>After this he went into his own country, &amp;  <a id="l2885"></a> taught them in the synagogue, but did not many <a id="l2886"></a>mighty works there because of their unbeleif. Then  the twelve having been abroad a year,  <a id="l2888"></a>returned, &amp; told Iesus all that they had done: &amp; at the same <a id="l2889"></a>time Herod beheaded Iohn in prison, &amp; his disciples came <a id="l2890"></a>&amp; told Iesus; &amp; when Iesus heard it, he took the twelve &amp; departed thence <a id="l2891"></a>privately by ship into a desert place belonging to Bethsaida: &amp; <a id="l2892"></a>the people when they knew it, followed him on foot out <a id="l2893"></a>of the cities, the winter being now past; &amp; he healed their <a id="l2894"></a>sick, &amp;  in the desert fed them to the number of <a id="l2895"></a>five thousand men besides weomen &amp; children with only five loaves <a id="l2896"></a>&amp; two fishes, (Mat. 14 Luke 9.)  at the doing of which miracle the Passover <a id="l2897"></a>of the Iews was  nigh, (Iohn 6.4) But Iesus went <a id="l2898"></a>not up to this  feast; but after these things walked in <a id="l2899"></a>Galilee, because the Iews  <a id="l2900"></a>in the Passover before had taken counsel to destroy him, <a id="l2901"></a>&amp; still sought to kill him, (Iohn 7.1.) Henceforward therefore he is found first in the coast of Tyre &amp; Sidon,  then by the sea of Galilee, afterwards in the coast of Cæsarea Philippi; &amp; lastly at Capernaum, (Mat. 15.21, 29 &amp; ch. 16.13. &amp; 17.34.</p>
<p id="par173">Afterwards when the feast of Tabernacles was at <a id="l2902"></a>hand, his brethren upbraided him  for walking <a id="l2903"></a>secretly, &amp; urged him to go to the feast. But he went <a id="l2904"></a>not till they were gone, &amp; then went up privately, Iohn <a id="l2905"></a>7.2. &amp; when the Iews sought to stone him, escaped, Iohn 8.59. After this he was at the feast of the dedication in <a id="l2906"></a>winter, (Iohn 10.22) &amp; when they sought again to take <a id="l2907"></a>him he fled beyond Iordan (Iohn 10.39, 40. Matt. 19.1): where he stayed till the death <a id="l2908"></a>of Lazarus,  &amp; then came to Bethany <a id="l2909"></a>near Ierusalem, &amp; raised him,  Iohn 11. 7, 18. <a id="l2910"></a>whereupon the Iews took counsel  from that time to kill him: &amp; therefore he <a id="l2911"></a>walked no more openly  among the Iews, but went <a id="l2912"></a>thence unto a country near the wilderness, to a city <a id="l2913"></a>called Ephraim; &amp; there continued with his disciples till <a id="l2914"></a>the last Passover, in which the Iews put him to death, <a id="l2915"></a>Iohn 11.53, 54.</p>
<p id="par174">Thus have we, in the Gospels of Matthew &amp; Iohn <a id="l2916"></a>compared together,  the history of Christ's actions  in conti<a id="l2917"></a>nuall order during five passovers. Iohn is more distinct in <a id="l2918"></a>the beginning &amp; end; Matthew in the middle. What either omits, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p061r"> &lt;61r&gt; </span> the other supplies.  <a id="l2919"></a> The first passover was between the baptism of Christ <a id="l2920"></a>&amp; the imprisonment of Iohn, Iohn 2.13 the second within four <a id="l2921"></a>months after the imprisonment of Iohn, &amp; Christ's beginning to preach in Galilee Iohn 4.35. &amp; there<a id="l2922"></a>fore it was either that feast to which Iesus went up when the <a id="l2923"></a>Scribe desired to follow him, Matt 8.19 Luke 9.51, 57 or <a id="l2924"></a>the feast before it. The third was the  next <a id="l2925"></a>feast after it, when the corn was eared &amp; ripe, Mat. 12.<a id="l2926"></a>1. Luke 6.1. The fourth was that which was nigh   <a id="l2927"></a>  <sup class="note" id="n140-ref">[140]</sup>at hand where Christ wrought the miracle of the five loaves, Matt. 14.15. <a id="l2928"></a>Iohn 6.4, 5. &amp; the fifth is that in which Christ suffered, <a id="l2929"></a>Mat. 20.17. Iohn 12.1.</p>
<p id="par175">Between the first &amp; second Passover Iohn &amp; Christ baptized together, <a id="l2930"></a>till the imprisonment of Iohn,  which was four months before the second. Then <a id="l2931"></a>Christ began to preach, &amp; call his disciples; &amp; after he had <a id="l2932"></a>instructed them a year, sent them to preach in the cities <a id="l2933"></a>of the Iews:  at the same time Iohn hearing of the fame <a id="l2934"></a>of Christ, sent to him to know who he was. At the third, <a id="l2935"></a>the  chief Priests began to consult about the death of Christ. A <a id="l2936"></a>little before the fourth, the twelve after they had preached <a id="l2937"></a>a year in all the cities, returned to Christ; &amp; at the same <a id="l2938"></a>time  Herod beheaded Iohn in prison, after he had been in prison two years &amp; a quarter  &amp; thereupon Christ <a id="l2939"></a>fled into the  desert for fear of Herod.  The <a id="l2940"></a>fourth Christ went not up to for fear of the Iews, who <a id="l2941"></a>at the Passover before had consulted his death, &amp; because his time was not yet come. Thenceforward therefore till <a id="l2942"></a>the feast of Tabernacles he walked in Galilee, &amp; that <a id="l2943"></a>secretly for fear of Herod: &amp; after the feast of  <a id="l2944"></a> Tabernacles he returned no more into <a id="l2945"></a>Galilee,  but sometimes was at Ierusalem, <a id="l2946"></a>&amp; sometimes  retired beyond Iordan, or to the city Ephraim <a id="l2947"></a>by the wilderness, till the passover in which he was betrayed, <a id="l2948"></a> apprehended, &amp; crucified. </p>
<p id="par176">Iohn therefore baptized two summers, &amp; Christ preached three. <a id="l2952"></a>The first summer Iohn preached to make himself known, in <a id="l2953"></a>order to give testimony to  Christ. Then, after Christ came to his baptism <a id="l2954"></a>&amp; was made known to him,  he baptized another summer, to <a id="l2955"></a>make Christ known by his testimony; &amp; Christ also baptized the <a id="l2956"></a>same summer, to make himself the more known: &amp; by reason <a id="l2957"></a>of Iohn's testimony there came more to Christ's baptism than to <a id="l2958"></a>Iohn's. The winter following Iohn was imprisoned; &amp;  <a id="l2959"></a>now his course being at an end, Christ  entred upon <a id="l2960"></a>his  proper office of preaching in the cities. In the beginning <a id="l2961"></a>of his preaching he completed the number of the twelve Apostles, <a id="l2962"></a>&amp;  instructed them  all the first year  in order to send <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p062r"> &lt;62r&gt; </span> them abroad.   Before the end of this year, his fame by his preaching &amp; miracles  <a id="l2963"></a>was so far spread abroad, that the Iews at the passover <a id="l2964"></a> following consulted how to kill him. In the <a id="l2965"></a>second year of his preaching, it being no longer safe for <a id="l2966"></a>him to converse openly in Iudea, he sent the twelve <a id="l2967"></a>to preach in all their cities: &amp; in the end of the year they <a id="l2968"></a>returned to him, &amp; told him all they had done. All the <a id="l2969"></a>last year the twelve continued with him to be instructed more per<a id="l2970"></a>fectly, in order to their preaching   to all nations after <a id="l2971"></a>his death.  And  upon the news of Iohn's death, being afraid <a id="l2972"></a>of Herod as well as of the Iews, he walked this year more secretly <a id="l2973"></a>than before, frequenting deserts, &amp;  spending the last half of the year in <a id="l2974"></a>Iudea without the dominions of Herod.</p>
<p id="par177">Thus have you in the Gospels of Matthew &amp; Iohn all <a id="l2975"></a>things told in due order, from the beginning of Iohn's <a id="l2976"></a>preaching to the death of Christ, &amp; the years distinguished <a id="l2977"></a>from on another by such essential characters that they <a id="l2978"></a>cannot be mistaken. The second Passover is distinguished <a id="l2979"></a>from the first, by the interposition of Iohn's imprison<a id="l2980"></a>ment. The third is distinguished from the second, by <a id="l2981"></a>a double character: first, by the interposition of the <a id="l2982"></a>feast to which Christ went up, Mat. 8.19 Luke 9.57 &amp; <a id="l2983"></a> secondly, by the distance of time from the beginning <a id="l2984"></a>of Christ's preaching: For the second was in the begin<a id="l2985"></a>ning of his preaching; the third so long after, that <a id="l2986"></a>before it came Christ said, <em class="underline">Ffrom the days of Iohn the <a id="l2987"></a>Baptist untill now</em>, &amp;c. &amp; upbraided the Cities of Galilee <a id="l2988"></a>for their not repenting at his preaching, &amp; mighty <a id="l2989"></a>works done in all that time. The fourth is distin<a id="l2990"></a>guished from the 3<sup>d</sup>, by the mission of the twelve from Christ to <a id="l2991"></a>preach in the cities of Iudea in all the intervall. <a id="l2992"></a>The fifth is distinguished from   <a id="l2993"></a> all the former by the twelve's being  returned from preaching, <a id="l2994"></a>&amp; continuing with Christ in all the intervall between the fourth &amp; <a id="l2996"></a>fifth,  &amp; by the passion &amp; other infallible characters.</p>
<p id="par178">Now since the first summer of Iohn's  baptizing <a id="l2997"></a>fell in the fifteenth year of  the Emperor Tiberius, <a id="l2998"></a>&amp; by consequence the first of these five passovers in <a id="l2999"></a>his sixteenth year; the  last of them; in which Iesus <a id="l3000"></a>suffered will fall on the twentieth year of the same <a id="l3001"></a>Emperor,  &amp; by consequence in the consulship of Fabius &amp; <a id="l3002"></a>Vitellius, in the 79<sup>th</sup> Iulian year, &amp; year of Christ 34, <a id="l3003"></a>which was the sabbatical year of the Iews.  And that <a id="l3004"></a>it did so, I further confirm by these arguments.  </p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p063r"> &lt;63r&gt; </span>

<p id="par180"> </p>
<p id="par181">I take it for granted that the passion was on friday preparation of the Passover the  14 <a id="l3020"></a>day of the month Nisan.  the great feast of the Passover on satur<a id="l3021"></a>day the 15<sup>th</sup> day of Nisan, &amp; the resurrection on the day following. Now the 14<sup>th</sup> <a id="l3022"></a>day of Nisan always fell on the full moon next after the vernal <a id="l3023"></a>Equinox; &amp; the month began at the new moon before, not at <a id="l3024"></a>the true conjunction, but at the first appearance of the new <a id="l3025"></a>moon. For the Iews referred all the time of the silent moon (as <a id="l3026"></a>they phrased it, that is, of the Moon's disappearing) to the old moon. <a id="l3027"></a>And because the first appearance might  usually be about <a id="l3028"></a>18 hours after the true conjunction, therefore they began their <a id="l3029"></a>month from the sixth hour <sup class="note" id="n141-ref">[141]</sup>[at evening,  that is, at sunset, <a id="l3030"></a>next after the eighteenth hour from the conjunction. And this rule <a id="l3031"></a>they called יה Iah, designing by the letters י &amp; ה the number 18.</p>
<p id="par182">— I know that Epiphanius tells us (if some interpret his words <a id="l3032"></a>rightly) that the Iews  used a vitious cycle, &amp; thereby <a id="l3033"></a>anticipated the legal new moons by two days. But this he spake <a id="l3034"></a>certainly not as a witness, (for he neither understood Astronomy <a id="l3035"></a>nor Rabbinical learning) but  by arguing from his erroneous hypothesis about <a id="l3037"></a>the time of the passion. For the Iews did not anticipate, but <a id="l3038"></a>postpone their months. They thought it lawful to begin their <a id="l3039"></a>months a day later than the first appearance of the new moon,  because the new moon continued for more days than one; but  <a id="l3040"></a>than our; but <a id="l3041"></a>not a day sooner,  lest they should celebrate the new moon <a id="l3042"></a>before there was any. And the Iews still keep a tradition in their <a id="l3043"></a>books, that the Sanhedrim used diligently to define the new <a id="l3044"></a>moons by sight: sending witnesses into mountanous places, &amp; <a id="l3045"></a>examining them about the moon's appearing, &amp;  translating the new <a id="l3046"></a>moon from the day they had agreed on to the day before, as often as witnesses <a id="l3047"></a>came from distant regions, who had seen it a day sooner than <a id="l3048"></a>it was seen at Ierusalem.   Accordingly Iosephus, one of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p064r"> &lt;64r&gt; </span> Iewish Priests who had ministred in the temple,<sup><em>a</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n142-ref">[142]</sup> tells us <a id="l3049"></a>that the Passover was kept <em class="underline">on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of Nisan</em> κατὰ <a id="l3050"></a>σελήνην <em class="underline">according to the moon, when the Sun was in Aries</em>. <a id="l3051"></a>  This  is confirmed  also by two instances,  recorded by him which totally <a id="l3053"></a>overthrow the hypothesis of the Iews using a vitious cycle. <a id="l3054"></a> For  that year in which Ierusalem was taken &amp; destroyed, <a id="l3055"></a>he saith, the Passover was on the 14 day of the month <a id="l3056"></a>Xanticus, which to Iosephus is our April; &amp;  that five years <a id="l3057"></a>before, it fell on the 8<sup>th</sup> day of the same month. Which <a id="l3058"></a>two instances agree with the course of the moon.</p>
<p id="par183">Computing therefore the new moons of the first according to <a id="l3059"></a>the course of the Moon &amp; the rule Iah, &amp; thence counting <a id="l3060"></a>14 days, I find that the 14<sup>th</sup> day of this month in the <a id="l3061"></a>year of Christ 31, fell on Tuesday March 27: In the <a id="l3062"></a>year 32, on sunday Apr. 13. In the year 33, on Friday <a id="l3063"></a>Apr. 3. In the year 34, on wednesday March 24, or <a id="l3064"></a>rather  (for avoiding the equinox which fell <a id="l3065"></a>on the same day, &amp; for having a fitter time for har<a id="l3066"></a>vest) on Thursday Apr. 22. Also in the year 35, on <a id="l3067"></a>Tuesday Apr. 12. And in the year 36, on Saturday March <a id="l3068"></a>31.</p>
<p id="par184">But because the 15<sup>th</sup> &amp; 21<sup>st</sup> days of Nisan, &amp;  a day or two of Pen<a id="l3069"></a>tecost, &amp; the 10<sup>th</sup> 15<sup>th</sup> &amp; 22<sup>d</sup> of Tisri, were always sabba<a id="l3070"></a>tical days or days of rest, &amp; it was inconvenient on two sabbaths together  to be prohibited burying their dead &amp;  making ready  fresh meate, <a id="l3072"></a> &amp; in that <a id="l3074"></a>hot region  their meat  would be apt in two days to corrupt:  to avoyd <a id="l3075"></a>these &amp; such like inconveniences, the Iews postponed their <a id="l3076"></a>months a day, as  often as the first day of the <a id="l3077"></a>month Tisri, or (which is all one) the third of the month Nisan, <a id="l3078"></a>was Sunday, Wednesday or Friday: &amp;  <a id="l3079"></a>this rule they called אדו Adu, by the letters א, ד, ו, <a id="l3080"></a>signifying the numbers 1, 4, 6 that is, the 1<sup>st</sup> 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; 6<sup>t</sup> <a id="l3081"></a>days of the week:   which days we call Sunday, Wednesday &amp; Friday.

<p id="par185">By this computation therefore the year 32 is absolutely <a id="l3090"></a>excluded, because the passion cannot fall on friday without <a id="l3091"></a>  <a id="l3094"></a> making it five days after the full moon, or two <a id="l3096"></a>days before it;  whereas it ought to <a id="l3097"></a>be upon the day of the full moon, or the next day.  <a id="l3098"></a>For the same reason the years 31 &amp; 35 are excluded, because <a id="l3099"></a>in them the passion cannot fall on friday, without making it <a id="l3100"></a>three days after the full moon, or four days before it: <a id="l3101"></a> Errors so enormous, that they would <a id="l3102"></a>be very conspicuous in the heavens to every vulgar <a id="l3103"></a>eye.

<p id="par189">Tiberius in the beginning of his reign made Valerius <a id="l3118"></a>Gratus President of Iudea; &amp; after 11 years,  substituted Pontius <a id="l3119"></a>Pilate,   who governed 10 years Vitellius, newly made President of Syria, deprived <a id="l3121"></a>him of his honour, substituting Marcellus, &amp; at length sent him <a id="l3122"></a>to Rome: but (by reason of delays) Tiberius died before Pilate got <a id="l3123"></a>thither. In the mean time Vitellius, after he had deposed <a id="l3124"></a>Pilate, came to Ierusalem in the time of the Passover, to <a id="l3125"></a> visit that Province as well as others in the beginning of his office;  &amp; in the place of Caiaphas, then High Priest, <a id="l3127"></a>created Ionathas the son of Ananus,  or Annas as he is called in scripture. <a id="l3128"></a> Afterwards, when Vitellius was returned to Antioch, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p066r"> &lt;66r&gt; </span> he received letters from Tiberius to make peace with <a id="l3129"></a>Artabanus king of the Parthians. At the same time the <a id="l3130"></a>Alans, by the sollicitation of Tiberius, invaded the kingdom <a id="l3131"></a>of Artabanus; &amp; his Subjects also, by the procurement of <a id="l3132"></a>Vitellius,  soon after rebelled. For <a id="l3133"></a>Tiberius thought that Artabanus, thus pressed with difficulties, <a id="l3134"></a>would more readily accept the conditions of peace. Arta<a id="l3135"></a>banus therefore streightway gathering a greater army, <a id="l3136"></a>opprest the rebells; &amp; then meeting Vitellius at Euphrates, <a id="l3137"></a>made a league with the Romans. After this Tiberius com<a id="l3138"></a>manded Vitellius to make war upon Aretas King of <a id="l3139"></a>Arabia. He therefore leading his army against Aretas, <a id="l3140"></a>went together with Herod to Ierusalem, to sacrifice at <a id="l3141"></a>the publick Feast which was then to be  celebrated: Where <a id="l3142"></a>being received honourably, he stayed three days, &amp; in the <a id="l3143"></a>mean while translated the  high Priesthood from Ionathas <a id="l3144"></a>to his Brother Theophilus: And the fourth day, receiving <a id="l3145"></a>letters  of the death of Tiberius,  made the people <a id="l3146"></a>swear allegiance to Caius the new Emperor; &amp; recalling back <a id="l3147"></a>his army, sent them  back into their quarters. All <a id="l3148"></a>this is related by Iosephus lib. 18 Antiq. c. 6, 7. Now Tibe<a id="l3149"></a>rius reigned 22 years &amp; 7 months, &amp; died  March 16 <a id="l3150"></a>in the beginning of the year of Christ 37; &amp; the  feast of <a id="l3151"></a>the Passover fell on April 20 following, that is, 35 days after the <a id="l3152"></a>death of Tiberius: so that there were about 36 or 38 <a id="l3153"></a>days for the news of his death to come from Rome to  <a id="l3154"></a>Vitellius at Ierusalem; which being a convenient time for <a id="l3155"></a> that message, confirms that the Feast which Vitellius  <a id="l3156"></a>&amp; Herod now went up to was the Passover. For had it <a id="l3157"></a>been the Pentecost, (as is usually supposed)  Vitellius would have continued three months ignorant <a id="l3159"></a>of the Emperor's death: which is not to be supposed. However, <a id="l3160"></a>the things done between this  Feast &amp; the passover  <a id="l3161"></a>which Vitellius was at before,  (namely, the stirring up a sedition in Parthia, the quieting  that sedition, the making a league  after that with  the Parthians, the sending news of that league to Rome,  the receiving new order from <a id="l3165"></a>thence to go against the Arabians, &amp; putting those orders in execution) required much more time <a id="l3166"></a>than the fifty days between the Passover &amp; Pentecost of the <a id="l3167"></a>same year; &amp; therefore the Passover  which Vitellius first <a id="l3168"></a>went up to, was in the year before.  So then Pilate was de<a id="l3169"></a>posed before the Passover A.C. 36, &amp; by consequence the <a id="l3170"></a>passion of Christ was before the passover: For he suffered <a id="l3171"></a>not under Vitellius, nor under Vitellius &amp; Pilate together, but <a id="l3172"></a>under Pilate alone.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p067r"> &lt;67r&gt; </span>
<p id="par190">Now its observable that the high Priesthood was at this <a id="l3173"></a>time become an annual office, &amp; the Passover was the time of making <a id="l3174"></a>a new High Priest. For Gratus the predecessor of Pilate, <a id="l3175"></a>saith Iosephus, made Ismael High Priest after Ananus; &amp; <a id="l3176"></a>a while after  (suppose a year) deposed him, &amp; substi<a id="l3177"></a>tuted Eleazar, &amp; a year after Simon, &amp; after another <a id="l3178"></a>year Caiaphas; &amp; then gave way to Pilate. So Vitellius <a id="l3179"></a>at  one Passover  <a id="l3180"></a>  made Ionathas successor to  Caiaphas, &amp; at <a id="l3181"></a>the next  Theophilus  to Ionathas.   Hence <a id="l3182"></a>Luke tells you, that in the 15<sup>th</sup> year of Tiberius, Annas <a id="l3183"></a>&amp; Caiaphas were High Priests, that is, Annas till the <a id="l3184"></a>Passover, &amp;  Caiaphas afterwards.   Accordingly Iohn speaks of the High Priesthood as an annual office: For he tells you  <a id="l3185"></a> again &amp; again, in that last year of Christ's preaching, that <a id="l3186"></a>Caiaphas was High Priest for that year, Iohn 11.49, 51. <a id="l3187"></a>&amp; 18.13. And  the next year Luke tells you, that Annas <a id="l3188"></a>was High Priest, Act. 4.6. So then  Theophilus was <a id="l3189"></a>made High Priest in the first year of Caius, Ionathas <a id="l3190"></a>in the 22<sup>th</sup> year of Tiberius,  &amp; Caiaphas <a id="l3191"></a>in the 21<sup>st</sup> year of the same emperor:  <a id="l3192"></a> <a id="l3193"></a> &amp; therefore,   allotting a year to each, the passion when Annas  succeeded  Caiaphas,  could not be later <a id="l3195"></a>then  the 20<sup>th</sup>  year of Tiberius, A.C. 34.</p>

<p id="par192">So then there remain only the years 33 &amp; 34 <a id="l3197"></a>to be considered; &amp;  the year 33 I exclude by <a id="l3198"></a>this argument. In the  passover  two years <a id="l3199"></a>before the passion, when Christ went thro' the <a id="l3200"></a>corn, &amp; his disciples pluckt the ears, &amp; rubbed them <a id="l3201"></a>with their hands to eat; this ripeness of the  corn <a id="l3202"></a>shews that the passover then fell late.  And so <a id="l3208"></a>did the Passover A.C. 32, Apr. 14. But the Passover A.C. <a id="l3209"></a>31, March 28<sup>th</sup> fell very early. It was not therefore <a id="l3210"></a>two years after the year 31, but two years after 32 <a id="l3211"></a>that Christ suffered.</p>
<p id="par193">So then all the characters of the Passion agree to the year 34;  &amp; this is the only <a id="l3212"></a>year to which they all agree:</p>

And after his example, Se<a id="l3288"></a>leucus, Cassander, Lysimachus &amp; Ptolemy, took upon them<a id="l3289"></a>selves the title &amp; dignity of kings, having abstained <a id="l3290"></a>from this honour while there  remained any <a id="l3291"></a>of Alexander's race to inherit the crown.  Thus the <a id="l3292"></a>Monarchy of the Greeks for want of an heir was broken into <a id="l3293"></a>several kingdoms; four of which, seated to the four winds of <a id="l3294"></a>heaven, were very eminent. For Ptolemy reigned over Egypt, <a id="l3295"></a>Lybia &amp; Ethiopia; Antigonus over Syria &amp; the lesser Asia; <a id="l3296"></a>Lysimachus in Thrace; &amp; Cassander over Macedon, Greece &amp; <a id="l3297"></a>Epire, as above.</p>
<p id="par196">Seleucus at this time reigned over the nations which <a id="l3298"></a>were beyond Euphrates, &amp; belonged to the bodies of the two <a id="l3299"></a>first Beasts: but after six years he conquered Antigonus, <a id="l3300"></a>&amp; thereby became one of the four kingdoms: For Cassan<a id="l3301"></a>der being afraid of the power of Antigonus, combined with  <a id="l3302"></a> Lysimachus, Ptolemy &amp; Seleucus, against him. And <a id="l3303"></a>while Lysimachus invaded the parts of Asia next the Helles<a id="l3304"></a>pont,  Ptolemy subdued Phœnicia &amp; Cœlosyria,  with the sea-coasts <a id="l3305"></a>of Asia.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p070r"> &lt;70r&gt; </span>
<p id="par197" class="i0">Seleucus came down with  a powerfull army into Cappadocia, <a id="l3306"></a>&amp; joyning the confederate forces, fought Antigonus in Phrygia <a id="l3307"></a>&amp; slew him &amp; seized his kingdom, Ann.

<p id="par198">Yet Demetrius the son of Antigonus retained but a small part <a id="l3311"></a>of his father's dominions, &amp; at length lost Cyprus to Ptolemy; <a id="l3312"></a>but killing Alexander, the son &amp; successor of Cassander king <a id="l3313"></a>of Macedon, seized his kingdom Ann.

Lysimachus in his warrs <a id="l3322"></a>with Antigonus and Demetrius, had taken from them Caria, Lydia, <a id="l3323"></a>&amp; Phrygia; &amp; had a treasury in Pergamus, a castle on the top of <a id="l3324"></a>a comical hill in Phrygia, by the river Caicus,  <a id="l3325"></a>the custody  of which he had coommitted to one Philetærus, who was at first faithfull <a id="l3326"></a>to Lysimachus, but in the last year of his reign revolted; For <a id="l3327"></a>Lysimachus,  at the instigation of his wife Arsinoe, slew first <a id="l3328"></a>his own son Agathocles, &amp; then those that lamented him. <a id="l3329"></a>Vpon which the wife Agathocles fled with her children &amp; <a id="l3330"></a>brothers, &amp; some others of their friends, &amp; sollicited Seleucus <a id="l3331"></a>to make war upon Lysimachus.  Philetærus also, grieving <a id="l3332"></a>at the death of Agathocles, &amp; being accused thereof by Arsinoe, <a id="l3333"></a>revolted, &amp; sided with Seleucus. On this occasion Seleucus &amp; <a id="l3334"></a>Lysimachus met &amp; fought in Phrygia; &amp; Lysimachus being slain <a id="l3335"></a>in the battel, lost his kingdom to Seleucus, Ann.

<p id="par201">About twelve years after the battel between Philo<a id="l3421"></a>pator &amp; Antiochus, Philopator died, &amp; left his kingdom to his <a id="l3422"></a>young son Ptolemæus Epiphanes, a child five years old. Thereupon <a id="l3423"></a>Antiochus magnus confederated with Philip king of Macedon, that <a id="l3424"></a>they should invade the dominions of Epiphanes which lay next <a id="l3425"></a>to each of them.  Hence arose a various war between An<a id="l3426"></a>tiochus &amp; Epiphanes, they seizing Phœnicia &amp; Cœlosyria by turns; <a id="l3427"></a>whereby those countries were much afflicted by both parties. First <a id="l3428"></a>Antiochus seized those countries; then one Scopas being sent with <a id="l3429"></a>the army of Egypt, recovered them from Antiochus:  the next <a id="l3430"></a>year,  Nabonass. 550, Antiochus fought &amp; routed Scopas <a id="l3431"></a>near the fountains of Iordan, besieged him in Sidon, took the <a id="l3432"></a>city, &amp; recovered Syria &amp; Phænicia from Egypt, the Iews coming <a id="l3433"></a>over to him voluntarily. But about three years after, upon <a id="l3434"></a>preparing for a war against the Romans, he came to Raphia <a id="l3435"></a>in the borders of Egypt,  made peace with Epiphanes, &amp; gave <a id="l3436"></a>him his daughter Cleopatra:  the next autumn he passed the Helles<a id="l3437"></a>pont to invade the cities of Greece under the Roman protection, <a id="l3438"></a>&amp; took some of them, but was beaten by the Romans the summer <a id="l3439"></a>following, &amp; forced to return back with his army into Asia.  <a id="l3440"></a>Before the end of the year the fleet of Antiochus was beaten by <a id="l3441"></a>the fleet of the Romans near Phocæa.  At the same time <a id="l3442"></a>Epiphanes &amp; Cleopatra sent an embassy to Rome to congratulate the <a id="l3443"></a>Romans  on their success against their father Antiochus, &amp; to ex<a id="l3444"></a>hort them to prosecute the war against him into Asia.

<p id="par209">In the first ages of the Christian religion the Christians <a id="l3713"></a>of every city were governed by a Council of Presbyters, &amp; the <a id="l3714"></a>President of the Council was the Bishop of the city.  The <a id="l3715"></a>Bishop &amp; Presbyters of one city medled not with the affairs of <a id="l3716"></a>another city, except by admonitory Letters or Messages. Nor did <a id="l3717"></a>the Bishops of several cities meet together in Council before the <a id="l3718"></a>reign of the Emperor Commodus: For they could not meet together <a id="l3719"></a>without the leave of the Roman governours of the Provinces. But <a id="l3720"></a>in the reign of that Emperor they began to meet in Provincial <a id="l3721"></a>Councils, by the leave of the Governours; first in Asia in opposition <a id="l3722"></a>to the Cataphrygian heresy, &amp; soon after in other places &amp; upon <a id="l3723"></a>other occasions.  The Bishop of the head-city, or Metropolis of the <a id="l3724"></a>Roman Province, was usually made President of the Council.  <a id="l3725"></a>Hence came the authority of Metropolitan Bishops above that of <a id="l3726"></a>other Bishops within the Province. Hence also it was that the <a id="l3727"></a>Bishop of Rome in Cyprian's days called himself the Bishop of Bishops. <a id="l3728"></a>And as soon as the Empire became Christian, the Roman Emperors <a id="l3729"></a>began to call general Councills out of all the Provinces of the Em<a id="l3730"></a>pire; &amp; by prescribing to them what points they should consider, <a id="l3731"></a>&amp; influencing them by their interest &amp; power, they set up what <a id="l3732"></a>party they pleased.  Hereby the Greek   Empire , upon the <a id="l3733"></a>division of the Roman Empire into the Greek &amp; Latin Empires, be<a id="l3734"></a>came <em class="underline">the king who</em> [in matters of religion] <em class="underline">did according to his will, <a id="l3735"></a>&amp;</em> [in legislature]  <em class="underline">exalted &amp; magnified himself above <a id="l3736"></a>every God</em>; &amp; at length, by the seventh General Council, established <a id="l3737"></a>the worship of the Images &amp; Souls of dead men, here called <a id="l3738"></a><em class="underline">Mahuzzims</em>.</p>
<p id="par210">The same king placed holiness in abstinence from marri<a id="l3739"></a>age.

Monta<a id="l3765"></a>nus refined upon them, &amp; made only second marriages unlawfull; <a id="l3766"></a> he introduced frequent fastings, &amp; annual fasting days, &amp; Lent, &amp; <a id="l3767"></a>feeding upon dryed meats. The <em class="underline">Apostolici</em>, about the middle <a id="l3768"></a>of the third Century, condemned marriage, &amp; were a branch of <a id="l3769"></a>the disciples of Tatian. The Hierocitæ in Egypt, in the latter end <a id="l3770"></a>of the third Century, also condemned marriage. Paul the Eremite <a id="l3771"></a>fled into the wilderness from the persecution of Decius, &amp; lived <a id="l3772"></a>there a solitary life till the reign of Constantine the great, but <a id="l3773"></a>made no disciples. Antony did the like in the persecution of <a id="l3774"></a>Diolesian, or a little before, &amp; made disciples; &amp; many others soon followed his <a id="l3775"></a>example.</p>
<p id="par211">Hitherto the Principles of the <em class="underline">Encratites</em> had been rejected <a id="l3776"></a>by the Churches; but now being refined by the Monks, &amp; imposed <a id="l3777"></a>not upon all men, but only upon those who would voluntarily <a id="l3778"></a>undertake a monastick life, began to be admired, &amp; to overflow <a id="l3779"></a>first the Greek Church, &amp; then the Latin Church, like a torrent. <a id="l3780"></a>Eusebius tells us<sup class="note" id="n164-ref">[164]</sup> that Constantine the great had those men in the <a id="l3781"></a>highest veneration, who dedicated themselves wholly to the <a id="l3782"></a>divine philosophy; &amp; that he almost venerated the most holy <a id="l3783"></a>company of Virgins perpetually  devoted to God, being certain <a id="l3784"></a>that the God to whom he had consecrated himself did dwell in <a id="l3785"></a>their minds. In his reign &amp; that of his sons, this profession of a <a id="l3786"></a>single life was propagated in Egypt by Antony, &amp; in Syria by <a id="l3787"></a>Hilarion; &amp; spread so fast, that soon after the reign of Iulian <a id="l3788"></a>the apostate a third part of the Egyptians were got into the <a id="l3789"></a> desarts of Egypt. They lived first singly in cells, then <a id="l3790"></a>associated into <em class="underline">cœnobia</em> or convents; &amp; at length came into towns, <a id="l3791"></a>&amp; filled the Churches with Bishops, Presbyters &amp; Deacons. Athanasius <a id="l3792"></a>in his younger days poured water upon the hands of his master <a id="l3793"></a>Antony; &amp; finding the Monks faithfull to him, made many of them <a id="l3794"></a>Bishops &amp; Presbyters in Egypt: &amp; these Bishops erected new monas<a id="l3795"></a>teries in their cities, out of which they chose Presbyters of their <a id="l3796"></a>own cities, &amp; sent Bishops to other cities.

<p id="par213">Thus the Sect of the <em class="underline">Encratites</em>, set on foot by the <em class="underline">Gnosticks</em> &amp;  propagated by Tatian <a id="l3827"></a>&amp; Montanus near the End of the second century,  which was condemned <a id="l3828"></a>by the Churches of that &amp; the third Century, &amp; refined by their <a id="l3829"></a>followers, overspread the eastern Churches in the fourth Century, <a id="l3830"></a>&amp; before the end of  it began to overspread the <a id="l3831"></a>western.  Henceforward the Christian Churches having a <a id="l3832"></a>form of Godliness, but denying the power thereof, came into <a id="l3833"></a>the hands of the <em class="underline">Encratites</em>; the heathens, who in the fourth <a id="l3834"></a>century came over in  great numbers to the Christians, em<a id="l3835"></a>bracing more readily this sort of Christianity, as having a greater <a id="l3836"></a>affinity with their old superstitions than that of the sincere <a id="l3837"></a>Christians, who by the lamps of the seven Churches of Asia, <a id="l3838"></a>&amp; not by the lamps of the Monasteries, had illuminated the <a id="l3839"></a>Church Catholick during the three first centuries.</p>
<p id="par214">V The <em class="underline">Cataphrygians</em> brought in also several other <a id="l3840"></a>superstitions, such as were the doctrine of Ghosts,  of their <a id="l3841"></a>punishment in Purgatory,  with prayers &amp; oblations for mitigat<a id="l3842"></a>ing that punishment, as Tertullian teaches in his books <a id="l3843"></a>De Anima &amp; De Monogamia.

Now this came to pass by steps in the following manner.</p>
<p id="par217">Gregory Nyssen tells us,<sup class="note" id="n169-ref">[169]</sup> that after the persecution of the <a id="l3894"></a>Emperor Decius, Gregory bishop of Neocæsarea in Pontus <em class="underline">in<a id="l3895"></a>stituted among all people, as an addition or corollary of devotion <a id="l3896"></a>towards God, that festival days &amp; assemblies should be celebrated <a id="l3897"></a>to them who had contended for the faith</em>, that is, to the Martyrs. <a id="l3898"></a>And he adds this reason for the institution: <em class="underline">When he observed;</em> <a id="l3899"></a>saith Nyssen, <em class="underline">that the simple &amp; unskilful multitude, by reason <a id="l3900"></a>of corporal delights, remained in the error of idols; that the prin<a id="l3901"></a>cipal thing might be corrected among them, namely, that <a id="l3902"></a>instead of their vain worship they might turn their eyes upon <a id="l3903"></a>God; he permitted that at the memories of the holy martyrs <a id="l3904"></a>they might make merry &amp; delight themselves, &amp; be <em class="doubleunderline">resolved</em><sup class="note" id="n170-ref">[170]</sup> into <a id="l3905"></a>joy</em>. The heathens were delighted with the festivals of their Gods, <a id="l3906"></a>&amp; unwilling to part with those delights; &amp; therefore Gregory, <a id="l3907"></a>to facilitate their conversion instituted annual festivals to the <a id="l3908"></a>saints &amp; martyrs.  Hence it came to pass, that for exploding <a id="l3909"></a>the festivals of the heathens, the principal festivals of the Christians <a id="l3910"></a>succeeded in the room of the principal festivals of the heathens; as <a id="l3911"></a>the keeping of Christmas with ivy &amp; feasting, &amp; playing &amp; sports, in <a id="l3912"></a>the room of the <em class="underline">Bacchanalia</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Saturnalia</em>; the celebrating of <a id="l3913"></a><em class="underline">May-day</em> with flowers in the room of the <em class="underline">Floralia</em>;<sup class="note" id="n171-ref">[171]</sup> &amp; the keeping <a id="l3914"></a>of festivals to the Virgin Mary, Iohn the Baptist, &amp; divers of the <a id="l3915"></a>Apostles, in the room of the solemnities at the entrance of the <a id="l3916"></a>Sun into the signs of the Zodiac in the old Iulian Calendar. <a id="l3917"></a>In the same persecution of Decius, Cyprian ordered the passions <a id="l3918"></a>of the Martyrs in Afric to be registred, in order to celebrate their <a id="l3919"></a>memories annually with oblations &amp; sacrifices. And Felix Bishop <a id="l3920"></a>of Rome, a little after, as Platina relates, <em class="underline">Martyrum gloriæ <a id="l3921"></a>consulens, constituit ut quotannis sacrificia eorum nomine cele<a id="l3922"></a>brarentur</em>; consulting the glory of the Martyrs, ordeined that <a id="l3923"></a>sacrifices should be celebrated annually in their name. By the <a id="l3924"></a>pleasure of these festivals the Christians increased much in <a id="l3925"></a>number, &amp; decreased as much in vertue, untill they were purged <a id="l3926"></a>&amp; made white by the persecution of Dioclesian. And this was the <a id="l3927"></a>first step made in the Christian religion towards the veneration <a id="l3928"></a>of the Martyrs. And tho it did not yet amount to an unlawful <a id="l3929"></a>worship; yet it disposed the Christians towards such a further <a id="l3930"></a>veneration of the dead, as in a short time ended in the invocation of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p082r"> &lt;82r&gt; </span> Saints</p>
<p id="par218">The next step was the affecting to pray at the sepulchres <a id="l3931"></a>of the Martyrs: which practice began in Dioclesian's persecution. <a id="l3932"></a>The Council of <em class="underline">Eleberis</em> in Spain, celebrated in the third or fourth <a id="l3933"></a>year of Dioclesian's persecution, A.C. 305, hath these Canons. <a id="l3934"></a>Can. 34; <em class="underline">Cereos per diem placuit in Cœmiterio non incendi. <a id="l3935"></a>Inquietandi enim spiritus sanctorum non sunt.

Can. 35; <em class="underline">Placuit prohiberi ne fœminæ in Cœmeterio pervigilent, eò <a id="l3937"></a>quod sæpe sub obtentu orationis latenter scelera com<a id="l3938"></a>mittant.</em> Presently after that persecution, suppose about <a id="l3939"></a>the year 314, the Council of Laodicea in Phrygia, which <a id="l3940"></a>then met for restoring the lapsed discipline of the Church, <a id="l3941"></a>has the following Canons. Can. 9: <em class="underline">Those of the Church <a id="l3942"></a>are not allowed to go into the Cœmeteries or Martyries <a id="l3943"></a>(as they are called) of hereticks, for the sake of the prayer <a id="l3944"></a>or recovery of health: but such as go, if they be of the <a id="l3945"></a>faithful, shall be excommunicated for a time</em>. Can. 34: <a id="l3946"></a><em class="underline">A Christian must not leave the Martyrs of Christ, &amp; go to <a id="l3947"></a>false Martyrs, that is, to the Martyrs of the Hereticks; <a id="l3948"></a>For these are an alien from God. And therefore let those be <a id="l3949"></a>anathema who go to them</em>. Can. 51: <em class="underline">The birth-days of <a id="l3950"></a>the Martyrs shall not be celebrated in Lent, but their <a id="l3951"></a>commemoration shall be made on the sabbath-days &amp; Lords <a id="l3952"></a>days.</em> The Council of Paphlagonia, celebrated in the year <a id="l3953"></a>324, made this Canon: <em class="underline">If any man being arrogant, abomi<a id="l3954"></a>nates the congregations of the Martyrs, or the Liturgies per<a id="l3955"></a>formed therein, or the memories of the Martyrs, let him be anathema</em>. By all which its manifest that the Christians <a id="l3956"></a>in the time of Dioclesian's persecution used to pray in the <a id="l3957"></a>Cœmeteries or burying-places of the dead, for avoiding the danger <a id="l3958"></a>of the persecution, &amp; for want of Churches, which were all <a id="l3959"></a>thrown down: and after the persecution was over, continued <a id="l3960"></a>that practice in honour to the Martyrs, till new churches <a id="l3961"></a>could be built; &amp; by use affected it as advantageous to devotion, <a id="l3962"></a>&amp; for recovering the health of those that were sick: &amp; that <a id="l3963"></a>in these burying-places they commemorated the martyrs yearly <a id="l3964"></a>upon days dedicated to them, &amp; accounted all these practices <a id="l3965"></a>pious &amp; religious, &amp; anathematized those men as arrogant <a id="l3966"></a>who opposed them or prayed in the Martyries of the Hereticks. <a id="l3967"></a>They also lighted torches to the Martyrs in the day-time, as the heathens <a id="l3968"></a>did to their Gods; which custom before the end of the fourth century, pre<a id="l3969"></a>vailed much in the west. And they sprinkled the worshipers of the Mar<a id="l3970"></a>tyrs with holy-water, as the heathens did the worshipers of their Gods: <a id="l3971"></a>&amp; went in procession to see Ierusalem &amp; other holy places, as if the <a id="l3972"></a>places conferred sanctity to the visiters.  From the custome of pray<a id="l3973"></a>ing in the Cœmeteries &amp; Martyries, came the custome of translating <a id="l3974"></a>the bodies of the saints &amp; martyrs into such Churches as were new <a id="l3975"></a>built: the Emperor Constantius beginning this practice about the <a id="l3976"></a>year 359, by causing the bodies of Andrew the Apostle &amp; Luke <a id="l3977"></a>&amp; Timothy to be translated into a new Church at Constantinople. <a id="l3978"></a>And before the Act of Constantius, the Egyptians kept the bodies <a id="l3979"></a>of their Martyrs &amp; Saints unburied upon beds in their private <a id="l3980"></a>houses, &amp; told stories of their souls appearing after death &amp; ascend<a id="l3981"></a>ing up to heaven, as Athanasius relates in the life of Antony. All <a id="l3982"></a>which gave occasion to the Emperor Iulian (as Cyrill<sup class="note" id="n172-ref">[172]</sup> relates) to <a id="l3983"></a>accuse the Christians in this manner: <em class="underline">Your adding to that ancient <a id="l3984"></a>dead man</em> [viz<sup>t</sup> Iesus] <em class="underline">many new dead men, who can sufficiently abo<a id="l3985"></a>minate? You have filled all places with Sepulchres &amp; monuments, altho</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p083r"> &lt;83r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">you are no where bidden to prostrate your selves to sepulchres, &amp; <a id="l3986"></a>to respect them officiously</em>. And a little after: <em class="underline">Since Iesus said that <a id="l3987"></a>sepulchres are full of filthiness, how do you invoke God upon them?</em> <a id="l3988"></a>And in another place he saith, that if Christians had adhered to the <a id="l3989"></a>precepts of the Hebrews, <em class="underline">they would have worshiped one God instead <a id="l3990"></a>of many, &amp; not a man, or rather not many unhappy men</em>: And that <a id="l3991"></a>they <em class="underline">adored the wood of the cross, making its images on their fore<a id="l3992"></a>heads, &amp; before their houses</em>.</p>
<p id="par219">After the sepulchres of Saints &amp; Martyrs were thus con<a id="l3993"></a>verted into places of worship like the heathen Temples &amp; the Churches <a id="l3994"></a>into sepulchres, &amp; a certain sort of sanctity was placed in the dead bodies <a id="l3995"></a>of the Saints &amp; <sup class="note" id="n173-ref">[173]</sup>[Martyrs buried in them, &amp; annual festivals were kept <a id="l3996"></a>to them, with sacrifices offered to God in their name; the next step <a id="l3997"></a>towards the invocation of Saints, was the attributing to the dead bodies <a id="l3998"></a>&amp; bones &amp; other reliques of the saints, a power of working miracles, <a id="l3999"></a>by means of the separate souls, who were supposed to know what <a id="l4000"></a>we do or say, &amp; to be able to do us good or hurt, &amp; to work those mi<a id="l4001"></a>racles.  This is the very notion that the heathens had of the se<a id="l4002"></a>parate souls of their ancient kings &amp; heros, whom they worshiped <a id="l4003"></a>under the names of Saturn, Rhea, Iupiter, Iuno, Mars, Venus, <a id="l4004"></a>Bacchus, Ceres, Osiris, Isis, Apollo, Diana, &amp; the rest of their  <a id="l4005"></a>Gods:  For these Gods being male &amp; female, husband &amp; wife, son &amp; <a id="l4006"></a>daughter, brother &amp; sister, are thereby discovered to be ancient <a id="l4007"></a>men &amp; weomen. And as the first step towards the invocation <a id="l4008"></a>of saints was set on foot by the persecution of Decius, &amp; the se<a id="l4009"></a>cond by the persecution of Dioclesian; so this third step seems <a id="l4010"></a>to have been set on foot by the proceedings of Constantius &amp; <a id="l4011"></a>Iulian the Apostate. When Iulian began to restore the <a id="l4012"></a>worship of the heathen Gods, &amp; vilify the saints &amp; martyrs; <a id="l4013"></a>the Christians of Syria &amp; Egypt seem to have made a great <a id="l4014"></a>noise of the miracles done by the reliques of the Christian <a id="l4015"></a>Saints &amp; Martyrs, in opposition to the powers attributed by <a id="l4016"></a>Iulian &amp; the heathens to their Idols. For  Sozomen <a id="l4017"></a>&amp; Ruffinus tell us, that when he opened the heathen Temples, <a id="l4018"></a>&amp; consulted the Oracle of Apollo Daphnæus in the suburbs of <a id="l4019"></a>Antioch, &amp; pressed by many sacrifices for an answer, the Oracle <a id="l4020"></a>at length told him that the bones of the martyr Babylas which <a id="l4021"></a>were buried there hindred him from speaking. By which answer <a id="l4022"></a>you may understand, that some Christian was got into the <a id="l4023"></a>place where the heathen Priests used to speak thro' a pipe <a id="l4024"></a>in delivering their Oracles. And before this, Hilary in his book <a id="l4025"></a>against Constantius, written in the last year of that Emperor, <a id="l4026"></a>makes this mention of what was then doing in the east where <a id="l4027"></a>he was. <em class="underline">Sine martyrio persequeris. Plus crudelitati vestræ <a id="l4028"></a>Nero, Deci, Maximiane, debemus. Diabolum enim per vos <a id="l4029"></a>vicimus. Sanctus ubique beatorum martyrum sanguis exceptus <a id="l4030"></a>est, dum in his Dæmones mugiunt, dum ægritudines depelluntur, <a id="l4031"></a>dum miraculorum opera cernuntur, elevari sine laqueis cor<a id="l4032"></a>pora, &amp; dispensis pede fœminis vestes non defluere in faciem, <a id="l4033"></a>uri sine ignibus spiritus, confiteri sine interrogantis incremento <a id="l4034"></a>fidei.</em> And Gregory Nazianzen, in his first Oration against the <a id="l4035"></a>Emperor Iulian then reigning, writes thus: <em class="underline">Martyres non exti<a id="l4036"></a>muisti quibus præclari honores &amp; festa constituta, a quibus <a id="l4037"></a>Dæmones propelluntur et morbi curantur; quorum sunt appa<a id="l4038"></a>ritiones &amp; prædictiones; quorum vel sola corpora idem possunt <a id="l4039"></a>quod animæ sanctæ, sive manibus contrectentur, sive honorentur: <a id="l4040"></a>quorum vel solæ sanguinis guttæ atque exigua passionis signa</em> [i.e. <a id="l4041"></a>Signa Crucis] <em class="underline">idem possunt quod corpora. Hæc non colis sed <a id="l4042"></a>contemnis et aspernaris</em>. These things made the Heathens in the <a id="l4043"></a>reign of the same Emperor demolish the sepulchre of Iohn the <a id="l4044"></a>Baptist in Phœnicia, &amp; burn his bones. And some Christians mixing <a id="l4045"></a>themselves with the heathens, gathered up some of his bones; which <a id="l4046"></a>being sent to Athanasius, he hid them in the wall of a Church, fore<a id="l4047"></a>seeing by a prophetick spirit, as Ruffinius tells us, that they might <a id="l4048"></a>be profitable to a future generation.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p084r"> &lt;84r&gt; </span>
<p id="par220">The cry of these miracles being once set on foot, continued for many <a id="l4049"></a>years, &amp; encreased &amp; grew more general.

A.C. 382] saith of the miracles done by the Saints <a id="l4052"></a>&amp; their reliques:<sup class="note" id="n174-ref">[174]</sup> <em class="underline">Nulla est nostri hujus Orbis seu regio, seu gens, seu Vrbs, <a id="l4053"></a>ubi nova et  inopinata miracula hæc non decantentur: quæ <a id="l4054"></a>quidem si figmenta fuissent prorsus in tantam hominum admirationem <a id="l4055"></a>non venissent</em>. And a little after: <em class="underline">Abunde Orationi nostræ fidem <a id="l4056"></a>faciunt quæ quotidiana a martyribus miracula eduntur, magna <a id="l4057"></a>affatim ad illa hominum multitudine affluente.</em> And in his 66<sup>th</sup> <a id="l4058"></a>Homily, describing how the Devils were  tormented &amp; cast out <a id="l4059"></a>by the bones of the Martyrs, he adds: <em class="underline">Ob eam causam multi <a id="l4060"></a>plerumque Reges peregre profecti sunt ut hoc spectaculo fruerentur. <a id="l4061"></a>Siquidem sanctorum martyrum templa futuri judicij vestigia et <a id="l4062"></a>signa exhibent, dum nimirum Dæmones flagris cæduntur, hominesque <a id="l4063"></a>torquentur et liberantur.

This Oration was written at Antioch while Alexandria was <a id="l4102"></a>yet the Metropolis of the east, that is, before the year 381, in which <a id="l4103"></a>Constantinople became the Metropolis. And it was a work of some <a id="l4104"></a>years for the Egyptians to have distributed the miracle-working reliques <a id="l4105"></a>of their Martyrs over all the world, as they had done before that year. <a id="l4106"></a>Ægypt abounded most with the reliques of saints &amp; Martyrs, the Egyp<a id="l4107"></a>tians keeping them embalmed upon beds even in their private houses; &amp; <a id="l4108"></a>Alexandria was eminent above all other cities for dispersing them, <a id="l4109"></a>so as on that account to acquire glory with all men, &amp; manifest her <a id="l4110"></a>self to be the <em class="underline">Metropolis</em> of the world.  Antioch followed the ex<a id="l4111"></a>ample of Egypt, in dispersing the reliques of the forty martyrs: &amp; the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p085r"> &lt;85r&gt; </span> examples of Egypt &amp; Syria were soon followed by the rest of the <a id="l4112"></a>world.</p>
<p id="par221">The reliques of the forty martyrs at Antioch were distributed <a id="l4113"></a>among the Churches before the year 373; For Athanasius who <a id="l4114"></a>died in that year, wrote an Oration upon them. This Oration is not <a id="l4115"></a>yet published, but Gerard Vossius saw it in MS in the Library of Cardi<a id="l4116"></a>nal Ascanius in Italy, as he mentions in his commentary upon <a id="l4117"></a>the Oration of Ephræm Sirus on the same 40 martyrs. And since <a id="l4118"></a>Alexandria sent the reliques of the Martyrs of Egypt into all <a id="l4119"></a>parts of the Earth, &amp; thereby acquired glory to their city, &amp; de<a id="l4120"></a>clared her in these matters the Metropolis of the whole world, <a id="l4121"></a>as you have heard out of Chrysostom; it may be concluded, that before <a id="l4122"></a>she received the 40 martyrs from Antioch, she began to send out <a id="l4123"></a>the reliques of her own martyrs into all parts, setting the first <a id="l4124"></a>example to other cities.  this practice therefore began in <a id="l4125"></a>Egypt some years before the death of Athanasius. It began when <a id="l4126"></a>the miracle-working bones of Iohn the Baptist were carried into <a id="l4127"></a>Egypt, &amp; hid in the wall of a Church, that they might be profitable <a id="l4128"></a>to a future generation. It was restrained during the reign of Iulian <a id="l4129"></a>the Apostate: And then it spred from Egypt into all the Empire, <a id="l4130"></a>Alexandria being the Metropolis of the whole world (according to <a id="l4131"></a>Chrysostom) for propagating this sort of devotion, &amp; Antioch &amp; other <a id="l4132"></a>cities soon following her example.</p>
<p id="par222">In propagating these superstitions, the ringleaders were the <a id="l4133"></a>Monks, &amp; Antony was at the head of them: For in the end of <a id="l4134"></a>the life of Antony, Athanasius relates that these were his dying <a id="l4135"></a>words to his disciples who then attended him. <em class="underline">Do you take care</em>, saith <a id="l4136"></a>Antony, <em class="underline">to adhere to Christ in the first place, &amp; then to the saints, <a id="l4137"></a>that after death they may receive you as friends &amp; acquaintance <a id="l4138"></a>into the everlasting Tabernacles. Think upon these things, per<a id="l4139"></a>ceive these things; &amp; if you have any regard to me, remember me as <a id="l4140"></a>a father.</em> This being delivered in charge to the Monks by Antony <a id="l4141"></a>at his death, A.C. 356, could not but inflame the whole body of the <a id="l4142"></a>Moncks in devotion towards the Saints, as the ready way to be received <a id="l4143"></a>by them into the eternal tabernacles after death.  Hence came <a id="l4144"></a>that noise about the miracles done by the reliques of the saints in <a id="l4145"></a>the reign of Constantius: Hence came the dispersion of the miracle-<a id="l4146"></a>working reliques into all the Empire, Alexandria setting the <a id="l4147"></a>example, &amp; being renouned for it above all other cities. Hence it <a id="l4148"></a>came to pass in the reign of Iulian (A.C. 362) that Athanasius <a id="l4149"></a>by a prophetic spirit (as Ruffinus tell us) hid the bones of Iohn <a id="l4150"></a>the Baptist from the heathens, not in the ground to be forgotten, <a id="l4151"></a>but in the hollow wall of a church before proper witnesses, <a id="l4152"></a>that they might <em class="underline">be profitable to a future generation</em>. Hence also <a id="l4153"></a>came the invocation of the saints for doing such miracles &amp; for <a id="l4154"></a>assisting men in their devotions, &amp; mediating with God. For Atha<a id="l4155"></a>nasius, even from his youth, looked upon the  dead saints and <a id="l4156"></a>Martyrs as mediators of our prayers:  in his Epistle to Mar<a id="l4157"></a>cellinus, written in the days of Constantine the great, he saith that <a id="l4158"></a>the words of the Psalms are not to be transposed or any wise changed, <a id="l4159"></a>but to be recited &amp; sung without any artifice, as they are writ[ten,<sup class="note" id="n177-ref">[177]</sup> <a id="l4160"></a><em class="underline">that the holy men who delivered them, knowing <a id="l4162"></a>them to be their own words, may pray with us, or rather that the <a id="l4163"></a>Holy Ghost who spake in the Holy men, seing his own words with <a id="l4164"></a>which he inspired them, may join</em> [with them] <em class="underline">in assisting us</em>.</p>
<p id="par223">And whilst Egypt abounded with Monks above any other <a id="l4165"></a>country, the veneration of the saints began sooner &amp; spred faster there then <a id="l4166"></a>in other places. Palladius going into Egypt in the year 388 to vi<a id="l4167"></a>sit the Monasteries, &amp; visiting the sepulchre of Apollonius &amp; other <a id="l4168"></a>Martyrs of Thebais who had suffered under Maximinus, saith of <a id="l4169"></a>them: <em class="underline">Iis omnibus Christiani fecerunt ædem unam, ubi nunc <a id="l4170"></a>multæ virtutes peraguntur. Tanta autem fuit viri gratia, ut de <a id="l4171"></a>ijs quæ esset præcatus statim exaudiretur, eum sic honorante <a id="l4172"></a>Servatore. Quem etiam nos in martyrio precati vidimus, cum</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p086r"> &lt;86r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">ijs qui cum ipso fuerunt Martyrio affecti; et Deum adorantes, <a id="l4173"></a>eorum corpora salutavimus.</em> And Eunapius, a heathen, but yet a <a id="l4174"></a>competent witnes of what was done in his own times, relating how <a id="l4175"></a>the soldiers delivered the heathen temples of Egypt into the hands <a id="l4176"></a>of the Monks, (which was done in the year 389) rails thus in an <a id="l4177"></a>impious manner at the martyrs, as succeeding in the room of the <a id="l4178"></a>old Gods of Egypt. <em class="underline">Illi ipsi</em> [milites] <em class="underline">Monachos Canobi quoque <a id="l4179"></a>collocarunt, ut pro Dijs qui animo cernuntur, servos et quidem <a id="l4180"></a>flagitiosos  divinis honoribus percolerent, homi<a id="l4181"></a>num mentibus ad cultum ceremoniasque obligatis. Ii namque con<a id="l4182"></a>dita et salita eorum capita, qui ob scelerum multitudinem <a id="l4183"></a>a judicibus extremo judicio fuerant affecti pro Divis ostentabant, <a id="l4184"></a>ijs genua  submittebant, eos in Deorum numerum <a id="l4185"></a>receptabant, ad illorum sepulchra pulvere sordibusque con<a id="l4186"></a>spurcati. Martyres igitur vocabantur, et Ministri quidem <a id="l4187"></a>et Legati  Arbitrique precum apud Deos, cum fuerint <a id="l4188"></a>servitia infida et flagris pessime subacta, quæ cicatrices sce<a id="l4189"></a>lerum ac nequitiæ vestigia corporibus circumferunt; Ejusmodi <a id="l4190"></a>tamen Deos fert tellus</em>. By these instances you may understand <a id="l4191"></a>that  the invocation of Saints was now of some standing in <a id="l4192"></a>Egypt, &amp; that it was already generally received &amp; practised there by <a id="l4193"></a>the common people. </p>
<p id="par224">Thus Basil a Monk, who was made bishop of Cæsarea in the year 369, &amp; died in the year 378, in his Oration on <a id="l4194"></a>the martyr Mamas, saith: <em class="underline">Be ye mindful of the Martyr, as <a id="l4195"></a>many of you as have enjoyed him in your dreams, as many as <a id="l4196"></a>in this place have  been assisted by him in prayer, <a id="l4197"></a>as many of you as upon invoking him by name have had him present <a id="l4198"></a>in your works, as many as he has restored to health, as many as <a id="l4199"></a>have had their dead children restored by him to life, as many <a id="l4200"></a>as have had their lives prolonged by him</em>. And a little after, he <a id="l4201"></a>thus expresses the universality of this superstition in the regions <a id="l4202"></a>of Cappadocia &amp; Bythinia: <em class="underline">At the memory of the martyr</em>, saith he, <a id="l4203"></a><em class="underline">the whole region is moved; at his festival the whole city is trans<a id="l4204"></a>ported with joy. Nor do the kindred of the rich turn aside to the <a id="l4205"></a>sepulchres of their ancestors, but all go to the place of piety.</em> And <a id="l4206"></a>in the end of the Homily he prays, that <em class="underline">God would preserve the <a id="l4207"></a> Church, thus fortified with the  great towers of the martyrs</em>. <a id="l4208"></a>And in his Oration on the forty martyrs: <em class="underline">These are they</em>, saith he, <a id="l4209"></a><em class="underline">who <sup class="note" id="n178-ref">[178]</sup> our country, like certain towers afford us safety <a id="l4210"></a>against our enemies. Neither are they shut up in once place <a id="l4211"></a>only, but being distributed are sent into many regions, &amp; adorn <a id="l4212"></a>many countries</em>. — <em class="underline">You have often endeavoured, you <a id="l4213"></a> have often laboured to find one who might pray for you; these <a id="l4214"></a>are forty emitting one voice of prayer.</em> — <em class="underline">He that is in <a id="l4215"></a>affliction flies to these, he that rejoices has recourse to these: <a id="l4216"></a>the first, that he may be freed from the evil, the last that <a id="l4217"></a>he may continue in the happiness. Here a woman praying for her <a id="l4218"></a>children is heard; she obteins a safe return for her husband</em> <a id="l4219"></a> <em class="underline">from abroad, &amp; health for him in his sickness.</em> — <em class="underline">O <a id="l4220"></a>common keepers of mankind, the best companions of our <a id="l4221"></a>cares, suffragans &amp; coadjutors of prayer, most powerfull <a id="l4222"></a>embassadors to God, &amp;c</em>. Now by all this it is manifest, that <a id="l4223"></a>before the year 378, the Oration &amp; Sermons upon the Saints <a id="l4224"></a>went much beyond the bounds of mere Oratorical flourishes, <a id="l4225"></a>&amp; that the common people in the East were already generally <a id="l4226"></a>corrupted by the Monks with saint-worship.</p>
<p id="par225">Gregory Nazianzen a Monk, in his sixth Oration written <a id="l4227"></a>A.C. 373, when he was newly made Bishop of Sasima, saith: <a id="l4228"></a><em class="underline">Let us purify our selves to the Martyrs, or rather to the God of <a id="l4229"></a>the Martyrs.</em> And a little after he calls the Martyrs <em class="underline">mediators <a id="l4230"></a>of obtaining an ascension or divinity</em>.  The same year in the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p087r"> &lt;87r&gt; </span> end of his Oration upon Athanasius then newly dead, he thus in<a id="l4231"></a>vokes him: <em class="underline">Do thou look down upon us propitiously, &amp; govern this <a id="l4232"></a>people, a perfect adorer of the perfect Trinity, which in the Father <a id="l4233"></a>Son &amp; Holy Ghost is contemplated &amp; adored: And if there shall be <a id="l4234"></a>peace, preserve me, &amp; feed my flock with me; but if war, re<a id="l4235"></a>duce me, &amp; place me with your self &amp; with such as you are, <a id="l4236"></a>altho it be great which I desire</em>. And in the end of the funer<a id="l4237"></a>al Oration upon Basil, written A.C. 378, he thus invokes Basil: <em class="underline">But thou, O divine &amp; sacred Head, look down upon us from heaven; <a id="l4238"></a>&amp; by thy prayers either take away that thorn of  the flesh which <a id="l4239"></a>is given us by God for exercise, or persuade that we may bear <a id="l4240"></a>it with courage, &amp; direct all our life to that which is most <a id="l4241"></a>conducible. And when we depart this life, receive us there <a id="l4242"></a>in your Tabernacles, that living together &amp; beholding the holy <a id="l4243"></a>&amp; blessed Trinity more purely &amp; perfectly, whereof we have <a id="l4244"></a>now but an imperfect view,  we may there come to the end <a id="l4245"></a>of our desires, &amp; receive this reward of the wars which we have <a id="l4246"></a>waged or suffered</em>. And in his Oration upon Cyprian, (not the <a id="l4247"></a>Bishop of Carthage, but a Greek) he invokes  him after the <a id="l4248"></a>same manner; &amp; tells us also how a pious virgin called <a id="l4249"></a>Iustina, was protected by invoking the Virgin Mary, &amp; how <a id="l4250"></a>miracles were done by the ashes of Cyprian.</p>
<p id="par226">Gregory Nyssen, another eminent Monk &amp; Bishop, in the <a id="l4251"></a>life of Ephræm Syrus, tells how a certain man returning from a <a id="l4252"></a>far country, was in great danger, by reason that all the ways <a id="l4253"></a>were intercepted by the armies of barbarous nations; but upon <a id="l4254"></a>invoking Ephræm by name, &amp; saying, <em class="underline">Holy Ephræm assist me</em>, <a id="l4255"></a>he escaped the danger, neglected the fear of death, &amp; beyond his hope got <a id="l4256"></a>safe home.  In the end of this Oration Gregory invokes Ephræm <a id="l4257"></a>after the following manner: <em class="underline">But thou</em> [o Ephræm] <em class="underline">assisting now <a id="l4258"></a>at the divine altar, &amp; sacrificing to the Prince of life, &amp; to <a id="l4259"></a>the most holy Trinity, together with the Angels, remember <a id="l4260"></a>us all, &amp; obtain for us pardon of our sins, that we may enjoy <a id="l4261"></a>the eternal happiness of the kingdom of heaven</em>. The same <a id="l4262"></a>Gregory, in his Oration on the martyr Theodorus written A.C. <a id="l4263"></a>381, thus describes the power of the Martyr, &amp; the practice of <a id="l4264"></a>the people. <em class="underline">This Martyr</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">the last year quieted <a id="l4265"></a>the barbarous tempest, &amp; put a stop to the horrid war of the <a id="l4266"></a>fierce &amp; cruel Scythians.</em> — <em class="underline">If any one is permitted to <a id="l4267"></a>carry away the dust with which the tomb is covered, wherein <a id="l4268"></a>the body of the martyr rests; the dust is accepted as a gift, &amp; <a id="l4269"></a>gathered to be laid up as a thing of great price. For to touch <a id="l4270"></a>the reliques themselves, if any such prosperous fortune shall <a id="l4271"></a>at any time happen; how great a favour that is, &amp; not to be <a id="l4272"></a>obtained without the most earnest prayers, they know well <a id="l4273"></a>who have obteined it. For as a living &amp; florid body, they  who <a id="l4274"></a>behold it embrace it, applying to it the eyes, mouth, ears, &amp; all <a id="l4275"></a>the organs of sense; &amp; then with affection pouring tears upon <a id="l4276"></a>the Martyr, as if he was whole &amp; appeared to them: they offer <a id="l4277"></a>prayers with supplication, that it would intercede for them as <a id="l4278"></a>an advocate, praying to him as an Officer attending upon God, <a id="l4279"></a>&amp; invoking him as receiving gifts whenever he will</em>.  at <a id="l4280"></a>length Gregory concludes the Oration with this prayer: <em class="underline">O <a id="l4281"></a>Theodorus, we want many blessings; Intercede &amp; deprecate <a id="l4282"></a>for your country before the common King &amp; Lord: For the <a id="l4283"></a>country of the martyr is the place of his passio n, &amp; they <a id="l4284"></a>are his citizens,  brethren &amp; kindred, who have him, &amp; defend, <a id="l4285"></a> adorn &amp; honour him. We fear afflictions. We expect <a id="l4286"></a>dangers: The wicked Scythians are not far off, ready to make <a id="l4287"></a>war against us. As a soldier fight for us, as a Martyr use li<a id="l4288"></a>berty of speech for your fellow-servants. Pray for peace, that <a id="l4289"></a>these publick meetings may not cease, that the furious and</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p088r"> &lt;88r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">wicked barbarian may not rage against the Temples &amp; altars, <a id="l4290"></a>that the profane &amp; impious may not trample upon the holy things. <a id="l4291"></a>For we  acknowledg it a benefit received from you, that we <a id="l4292"></a>are preserved safe &amp; entire,  and we pray for freedom from danger <a id="l4293"></a> in time to come. And if there shall be need of greater inter<a id="l4294"></a>cession &amp; deprecation, call together a Quire of your brethren <a id="l4295"></a>the Martyrs, &amp; in conjunction with them all intercede for us. <a id="l4296"></a>Let the prayers of many just ones atone for the sins of the multi<a id="l4297"></a>tudes &amp; peoples.

The same Gregory Nyssen, <a id="l4309"></a>in his sermon upon the death of Meletius bishop of Antioch, preach<a id="l4310"></a>ed at Constantinople the same year, (A.C. 381) before the bishops <a id="l4311"></a>of all the east assembled in the second General Council, spake <a id="l4312"></a>thus of Meletius. <em class="underline">The Bridegroom,</em> saith he, <em class="underline">is not taken from <a id="l4313"></a>us: He stands in the middle of us, tho we do not see him: He is a <a id="l4314"></a>Priest in the most inward places, &amp; face to face intercedes before God <a id="l4315"></a>for us &amp; the sins of the people</em>. This was no oratorical flourish, <a id="l4316"></a>but Gregory's real opinion, as you may understand by what <a id="l4317"></a>we have cited out of him concerning Ephræm &amp; Theodorus. <a id="l4318"></a>And  as Gregory preached this before the Council of Constanti<a id="l4319"></a>nople, you may thence know, (saith<sup><em>a</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n179-ref">[179]</sup> Baronius) that he professed <a id="l4320"></a>what the whole Council, &amp; therewith the whole Church of those <a id="l4321"></a>parts believed, namely, that the saints in heaven offer prayers <a id="l4322"></a>for us before God.</p>

<p id="par228">XIII By what has been cited out of Basil, the two Gregories &amp; Ephræm, <a id="l4370"></a>you may understand that saint-worship was established among the <a id="l4371"></a>Monks &amp; their admirers  in Egypt, Phœnicia, Syria <a id="l4372"></a>&amp; Cappadocia before the year 378, this being the year in which <a id="l4373"></a>Basil &amp; Ephræm died. Chrysostom was not much later; He preach<a id="l4374"></a>ed at Antioch almost all the reign of Theodosius the great, &amp; in <a id="l4375"></a>his sermons are many exhortations to this sort of superstition, <a id="l4376"></a>as you may see in the end of his Orations on S. Iulia, on S<sup>t</sup> Pela<a id="l4377"></a>gia, on the martyr Ignatius, on the Egyptian martyrs, on Fate &amp; <a id="l4378"></a>Providence, on the martyrs in general, on SS. Berenice &amp; Pros<a id="l4379"></a>doce: on Iuventinus &amp; Maximus, on the name of Cœmetery, &amp;c. <a id="l4380"></a>So in his Sermon on SS. Bernice and Prosdoce: <em class="underline">Perhaps</em>, saith he, <a id="l4381"></a><em class="underline">you are inflamed with no small love towards these Martyrs; <a id="l4382"></a>Therefore with this ardour let us fall down before their reliques, <a id="l4383"></a>Let us imbrace their coffins. For the coffins of the Martyrs <a id="l4384"></a>have great virtue, even as the bones of the martyrs have <a id="l4385"></a>great power. Neither let us only on the day of this festival, but <a id="l4386"></a>also on other days apply to them, invoke them, beseich them to <a id="l4387"></a>be our patrons: For they have great power &amp; efficacy, not <a id="l4388"></a>only whilst alive, but also after death, &amp; much more after <a id="l4389"></a>death. For now they bear the marks or brands of Christ; and <a id="l4390"></a>when they shew these marks, they can obtain all things of <a id="l4391"></a>the king. Seing therefore they abound with so much effi<a id="l4392"></a>cacy, &amp; have so much friendship with him; when we by con<a id="l4393"></a>tinual attendance &amp; perpetual visitation of them, have in<a id="l4394"></a>sinuated ourselves into their familiarity,  by their assistence <a id="l4395"></a>we may obtein the mercy of God</em>.</p>
<p id="par229">Constantinople was free from these superstitions till Gregory <a id="l4396"></a>Nazianzen came thither A.C. 379; but in a few years was inflamed <a id="l4397"></a>with it.  Ruffinus<sup><em>a</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n183-ref">[183]</sup> tells us, that when the Emperor Theodosius was <a id="l4398"></a>setting out against the tyrant Eugenius, (which was in the year 394) <a id="l4399"></a>he went about with the Priests &amp; people to all the places of prayers, <a id="l4400"></a>lay prostrate in haircloth before the shrines of the martyrs &amp; <a id="l4401"></a>Apostles,  <em class="underline">pray'd for assistance by the intercession of the Saints</em>. <a id="l4402"></a> Sozomen<sup><em>b</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n184-ref">[184]</sup> adds, that when the Emperor was marched seven <a id="l4403"></a>miles from Constantinople against Eugenius; he went into a <a id="l4404"></a>church which he had built  to Iohn the Baptist, <em class="underline">&amp; invoked the Bap<a id="l4405"></a>tist for his assistance</em>.  Chrysostom says<sup><em>c</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n185-ref">[185]</sup>: <em class="underline">He that is clothed in purple, <a id="l4406"></a>approaches to embrace these sepulchres; &amp; laying aside his dignity, stands <a id="l4407"></a>supplicating the saints to intercede for him with God. And he who goes <a id="l4408"></a>crowned with a diadem, offers his prayers to the tentmaker &amp; the fisher <a id="l4409"></a>as his Protectors</em>. And in <sup><em>d</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n186-ref">[186]</sup>another place: <em class="underline">The cities run together to</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p090r"> &lt;90r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">the sepulchres of the martyrs, &amp; the people are inflamed with the <a id="l4410"></a>love of them</em>.</p>
<p id="par230">The practice of sending reliques from place to place for working <a id="l4411"></a>miracles, &amp; thereby inflaming the devotion of the nations towards the <a id="l4412"></a>dead saints &amp; their reliques, &amp; setting up the religion of invoking <a id="l4413"></a>their souls, lasted only till the middle of the reign of the Emperor <a id="l4414"></a>Theodosius the great; For he then prohibited it by the following Edict. <a id="l4415"></a><em class="underline">Humatum corpus, nemo ad alterum locum transferat, nemo martyrem <a id="l4416"></a>distrahat, nemo mercetur.

Dat. <a id="l4419"></a>IV Kal. Mart. Constantinopoli, Honorio nob. puero &amp; Euodio Coss.</em> A.<a id="l4420"></a>C. 386. After this they filled  the fields &amp; high-ways with altars <a id="l4421"></a>erected to Martyrs, which they pretended to discover by dreams &amp; <a id="l4422"></a>revelations. And this occasioned the making of the fourteenth <a id="l4423"></a>Canon of the fifth Council of Carthage, A.C. 398. <em class="underline">Placuit ut <a id="l4424"></a>altaria quæ passim per agros aut vias, tanquam memoriæ <a id="l4425"></a>martyrum constituuntur, in quibus nullum corpus aut reliquiæ <a id="l4426"></a>martyrum conditæ probantur, ab Episcopis qui illis locis præsunt, <a id="l4427"></a>si fieri potest evertantur. Si autem hoc propter tumultus po<a id="l4428"></a>pulares non sinitur, plebes tamen admoneantur ne illa loca <a id="l4429"></a>frequentent, ut qui recte sapiunt nulla ibi superstitione de<a id="l4430"></a>vincti teneantur. Et omnino nulla memoria martyrum <a id="l4431"></a>probabiliter acceptetur, nisi ibi aut corpus aut aliquæ <a id="l4432"></a>certæ reliquiæ sint, aut ibi origo alicujus habitationis <a id="l4433"></a>vel possessionis vel passionis fidelissima origine traditur. <a id="l4434"></a>Nam quæ per somnia, et per inanes revelationes quorum<a id="l4435"></a>libet hominum ubique constituuntur altaria, omnimode re<a id="l4436"></a>probentur</em>. These Altars were for invoking the Saints or Martyrs <a id="l4437"></a>buried or pretended to be buried under them. First they filled the <a id="l4438"></a>Churches in all places with the reliques or pretended reliques of <a id="l4439"></a>the Martyrs for invoking them in the Churches; &amp; then they <a id="l4440"></a>filled the fields &amp; high-ways with altars for invoking them every <a id="l4441"></a>where. And this new religion was set up by the Monks in all the <a id="l4442"></a>Greek Empire before the  expedition of the Emperor Theodosius against Eugenius, &amp; I think before the above mentioned Edict of the Emperor A.C. 386.</p>
<p id="par231">The same religion of worshiping Mahuzzims quickly <a id="l4443"></a>spred into the Western Empire also: but Daniel in this Pro<a id="l4444"></a>phecy describes  chiefly the things done among the nations compre<a id="l4445"></a>hended in the body of his third Beast.</p>

<h2 class="cent">Chap. I <a id="l4479"></a><br> Introduction concerning the time <a id="l4480"></a><br>when the Apocalypse was writ.</h2>
<p id="par233">Irenæus has set on foot an opinion that the Apocalyps <a id="l4481"></a>was writ in the <em class="underline">reign</em><sup class="note" id="n195-ref">[195]</sup> of Domitian: but he postpones the <a id="l4482"></a>writing of other sacred books &amp; was to place the Apoca<a id="l4483"></a>lyps after them. Perhaps his master Polycarp might say he had it from Iohn in the end of Domatian's reign or Iohn might at that time put out a new edition of it &amp; Irenæus might thence frame a notion of its being written  at that time. Eusebius in his Chronicle &amp; Ecclesiastical <a id="l4484"></a>History follows Irenæus. But afterwards<sup><em>a</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n196-ref">[196]</sup> in his Evangelical <a id="l4485"></a>Demonstrations he conjoyns the banishment of Iohn into Patmos <a id="l4486"></a>with the death of Peter &amp; Paul: &amp; so does<sup><em>b</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n197-ref">[197]</sup> Tertullian <a id="l4488"></a>&amp; Pseudo-prochorus &amp; the first author whoever he was of that <a id="l4489"></a>very ancient  fable that Iohn was put by Nero into <a id="l4490"></a>a vessel of hot oyle &amp; coming out without hurt was <a id="l4491"></a>banished by him into Patmos. Tho this be but a fiction yet it was founded in a tradition of the first Churches that Iohn was banished into Patmos in Nero's reign Epiphanius represents the Gospel of Iohn written in <a id="l4492"></a>Domatian's reign &amp; the <a id="l4493"></a>Apocalyps before Nero's. Arethas in the beginning <a id="l4494"></a>of his Commentary mentions out of Eusebius the opinion <a id="l4495"></a>of Irenæus but follows it not: For<sup><em>c</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n198-ref">[198]</sup> afterwards he affirms <a id="l4496"></a>that the Apocalyps was writ before the destruction of <a id="l4497"></a>Ierusalem &amp; that former Commentators expounded the sixt <a id="l4498"></a>seal of that destruction. <img title="Symbol (a cross with all four arms crossed) in text" src="/resources/images/texts/symbol.gif" alt="Symbol (a cross with all four arms crossed) in text"><sup class="note" id="n199-ref">[199]</sup> With the opinion of the first <a id="l4499"></a>Commentators agrees the tradition of the Churches of Syria, <a id="l4500"></a> preserved to this day in the little of the Syriac Version of the Apo<a id="l4501"></a>calypse, which title is this: <em class="underline">The Revelation  which was made to Iohn the Evangelist by God in the <a id="l4503"></a>Island Patmos, into which he was banished by Nero the Cæsar</em>. <a id="l4504"></a>The same is confirmed by a story told by Eusebius<sup class="note" id="n200-ref">[200]</sup> out of <a id="l4505"></a>Clemens Alexandrinus, &amp; others antient authors, concerning <a id="l4506"></a>a youth, whom Iohn sometime after his return from <a id="l4507"></a>Patmos committed to the care of a  Bishop of a <a id="l4508"></a>certain city. The Bishop educated, instructed, &amp; at length <a id="l4509"></a>baptized him, but then remitted of his care. The young man <a id="l4510"></a>thereupon  got into ill company, &amp; began by degrees first to <a id="l4511"></a>revell &amp; grow vitious, &amp; then to abuse &amp; spoil those he <a id="l4512"></a>met in the night; &amp; at length grew so desperate, that his <a id="l4513"></a>companions turning a band of High-way men, made him their <a id="l4514"></a>Capitain &amp;, saith Chrysostom, <sup class="note" id="n201-ref">[201]</sup> he continued their capitain  <a id="l4515"></a>a long time. At length Iohn returning to that city, &amp; <a id="l4516"></a>hearing what was done, rode to the Thief; &amp;, then the <a id="l4517"></a>Thief out of reverence to his old Master fled, rode after <a id="l4518"></a>him, recalled him, &amp; restored him to the Church. This is a story <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p094r"> &lt;94r&gt; </span> of many years, &amp; requires that Iohn should have returned from Patmos <a id="l4519"></a>rather  at the death of Nero than  at that of Domitian; <a id="l4520"></a>because between the death of Domitian &amp; that of Iohn there <a id="l4521"></a>were but two years &amp; an half; &amp; Iohn in his old age was<sup><em>f</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n202-ref">[202]</sup> so infirm as <a id="l4522"></a>to be carried to Church, dying above 90 years old, &amp; therefore could not   × <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 93v &gt; </span>× be suppos'd then to<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 94r resumes &gt; </span> ride after thief.</p>
<p id="par234">This opinion is further confirmed ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the top of f 93v &gt; </span>✝ by the allusions in the Apocalypse to the Temple &amp; Altar, &amp; Holy City, as <a id="l4523"></a>then standing; &amp; to the Gentiles who were soon after to tread under foot <a id="l4524"></a>the Holy City &amp; outward Court. Tis confirmed also —<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 94r resumes &gt; </span> by the style of the <a id="l4525"></a>Apocalyps, which is fuller of Hebraisms then his Gospel. For thence  it may be gathered that it was writ when Iohn was newly come out <a id="l4527"></a>of Iudea,  where he had been used to the Syriac tongue; &amp; that he did not write his Gospel till by long converse with the Asia<a id="l4528"></a>tick Greeks   he had left off most of the Hebraisms. It is confirmed also by the many false Apoca<a id="l4530"></a>lypses (those of Peter, Paul, Thomas, Stephen, Elias, Cerinthus) <a id="l4531"></a>writ in imitation of the true one. For as the many fals <a id="l4532"></a>Gospels, fals Acts, &amp; fals Epistles were occasioned by true <a id="l4533"></a>ones; &amp; the writing many fals Apocalyses, &amp; ascribing them to <a id="l4534"></a>Apostles &amp; Prophets, argues that there was a true Apostolick <a id="l4535"></a>one in great request with the first Christians: so this true one <a id="l4536"></a> may well be suppos'd to have been written early, that there  might be room <a id="l4537"></a> in the Apostlic age for the writing of so many fals <a id="l4538"></a>ones afterwards, &amp; fathering them upon Peter, Paul, Thomas &amp; others who were dead before Iohn. Caius (who was contemporary  with  Tertullian)<sup><em>g</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n203-ref">[203]</sup> tells us <a id="l4539"></a>that Cerinthus wrote his Revelations as a great Apostle, &amp; pre<a id="l4540"></a>tended the visions were shewn him by Angels, asserting a <a id="l4541"></a>millennium of carnal pleasures at Ierusalem after  <a id="l4542"></a>the resurrection; so that his Apocalyps was plainly writ in <a id="l4543"></a>imitation of Iohn's: &amp; yet he lived so early, that<sup><em>h</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n204-ref">[204]</sup> he resisted <a id="l4544"></a>the Apostles at Ierusalem in or before the first year of <a id="l4545"></a>Claudius,(that is, 26 years before the death of Nero) &amp; <sup><em>i</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n205-ref">[205]</sup>died <a id="l4546"></a>before Iohn.</p>
<p id="par235">These reasons may suffice for determining the time; &amp; <a id="l4547"></a>yet there is one more, which to considering men may seem <a id="l4548"></a>a good reason, to others not.

<p id="par236">Seing therefore Peter &amp; Iohn were Apostles of <a id="l4624"></a>the circumcision, it seems to me that they staid with <a id="l4625"></a>their churches in Iudea &amp; Syria till the Romans made <a id="l4626"></a>war upon their nation, that is, till the twelfth year of Nero; that they then followed the <a id="l4627"></a>main body of their flying churches into  Asia, &amp; <a id="l4628"></a>Peter went thence by Corinth to Rome; that the Roman Empire looked <a id="l4629"></a>upon those churches as enemies, because Iews by birth; <a id="l4630"></a>&amp; therefore to prevent insurrections, secured their leaders, <a id="l4631"></a>&amp; banished Iohn into Patmos; &amp; that soon after the <a id="l4632"></a>writing of the Apocalypse, the epistle to the Hebrews &amp; <a id="l4633"></a>those of Peter were written to these Churches, with reference to this Prophesy as a thing they were particularly concerned in.

For till then the Heathens were at peace with the Christian Iews, as well as with the rest. The epistle to the Hebrews,  since it mentions Timothy <a id="l4636"></a>as related to those Hebrews, must be written to them after <a id="l4637"></a>their flight into Asia, where Timothy was Bishop, &amp; by consequence after the war began,  the Hebrews in Iudea being strangers to Timothy. And <a id="l4638"></a>Peter seems to call Rome Babylon, as well with respect to <a id="l4639"></a>the war made upon Iudea &amp; the approaching captivity like that under old Babylon, as with respect to that name in the <a id="l4640"></a>Apocalypse: &amp; in writing to the strangers scattered thro'out <a id="l4641"></a>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia &amp; Bithynia, he seems to in<a id="l4642"></a>timate that they were the strangers newly scattered by <a id="l4643"></a>the Roman wars; for those were the only strangers there <a id="l4644"></a>belonging to his care.</p>

<p id="par238">Having determined the time of writing the Apocalypse, <a id="l4681"></a>I need not say much about the truth of it,  since it was <a id="l4682"></a>in such request with the first ages, that  many endeavoured to imitate it, by feigning  Apoca<a id="l4684"></a>lypses under the Apostles names; &amp; the Apostles themselves as I have  just now<sup class="note" id="n236-ref">[236]</sup> shewed) stu<a id="l4685"></a>died it, &amp; used its phrases, by which means the style of the <a id="l4686"></a> Epistle to the Hebrews became more mystical than that of <a id="l4687"></a> Paul's other epistles, &amp; the style of Iohn's Gospel  more <a id="l4688"></a> figurative &amp; majestical than that of the other Gospels.  I do not find that Christ was called the word of God in any book of the new <a id="l4689"></a>Testament written before the Apocalypse; &amp; therefore am of opinion, the language <a id="l4690"></a>was taken from this Prophesy, as were also many other phrases in this Gospel, such as  those of Christ's being <em class="underline">the light which enlightens the world, the lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world, the Bridegroom, he that testifieth, he that came down from heaven, the Son of God,</em> &amp;c.

Prophesy: For in all ages, as many as beleived the thousand years, received the Apo<a id="l4704"></a>calypse as the foundation of their opinion. I do not know an <a id="l4705"></a>instance to the contrary.  Papias Bishop of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p098r"> &lt;98r&gt; </span> Hierapolis, a man of the Apostolic age, &amp; one of Iohn's own <a id="l4706"></a>disciples, did not only  teach the doctrine of the  <a id="l4707"></a>thousand years, but also <em>a</em><sup class="note" id="n237-ref">[237]</sup>asserted the Apocalypse as written by di<a id="l4708"></a>vine inspiration. Melito, who flourished next after Iustin, <a id="l4709"></a><sup><em>b</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n238-ref">[238]</sup>wrote a  commentary upon this prophesy; &amp; he, being <a id="l4710"></a>bishop of Sardis one of the seven churches, could neither be <a id="l4711"></a>ignorant of their tradition about it, not impose upon them. <a id="l4712"></a>Irenæus, who was contemporary  with Melito, wrote much upon <a id="l4713"></a>it, &amp; said, that <em class="underline">the number 666 was in all the antient &amp; <a id="l4714"></a>approved copies; &amp; that he had it also confirmed  to him by <a id="l4715"></a>those   who had seen Iohn face to face</em>, meaning no doubt <a id="l4716"></a>his master Polycarp for one. At the same time <sup><em>c</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n239-ref">[239]</sup>Theophi<a id="l4717"></a>lus bishop of Antioch asserted it, &amp; so did Tertullian, <a id="l4718"></a>Clemens Alexandrinus, &amp; Origen soon after; &amp;  their contemporary <a id="l4719"></a>Hippolytus the martyr,  metropolitan of the Arabians, <a id="l4720"></a><sup><em>d</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n240-ref">[240]</sup>wrote a commentary upon it &amp; so did Victorinus Pictabionensis. All these were antient men, <a id="l4721"></a>flourishing within a hundred &amp; twenty years after Iohn's <a id="l4722"></a>death, &amp;  of greatest note in the Churches of those times. <a id="l4723"></a> Soon after did Victo[rinus<sup class="note" id="n241-ref">[241]</sup> Pictaviensis write another commentary upon it; He lived in the reign of Dioclesian. And this may suffice to shew how much this book was <a id="l4724"></a>received &amp; studied in the first ages:  nay, I do not find any <a id="l4725"></a>other book of the new Testament so strongly attested; nor <a id="l4726"></a>commented upon so early as this. The Prophesy said: <em class="underline">Blessed  is <a id="l4727"></a>he that readeth, &amp; they that hear the words of this Prophesy, <a id="l4728"></a>&amp; keep the things which are written therein.</em> This animated <a id="l4729"></a>the first Christians to study it  <a id="l4730"></a>so much , till the difficulty made them remit, &amp; comment <a id="l4731"></a>more upon the other books of the new testament. And <a id="l4732"></a>this was the state of the Apocalypse, till the  <a id="l4733"></a>thousand years being misunderstood, brought a prejudice <a id="l4734"></a>against this book: &amp; Dionysius of Alexandria, by noting <a id="l4735"></a>how it abounded with barbarisms, that is with hebraisms, <a id="l4736"></a>promoted the prejudice so, as to cause many Greeks in <a id="l4737"></a>the fourth Century to doubt of it. But whilst the <a id="l4738"></a><em class="underline">Latins</em>, &amp; a great part of the <em class="underline">Greeks</em>, always retained <a id="l4739"></a>the book, &amp; the rest doubted only out of prejudice, <a id="l4740"></a>it makes nothing against its authority.</p>
<p id="par239">This Prophecy is called <em class="underline">the Revelation</em>, with <a id="l4741"></a>respect to <em class="underline">the Scripture of truth</em>, which Daniel<sup class="note" id="n242-ref">[242]</sup> was <a id="l4742"></a>commanded to shut up &amp; seal, till the time of the end. <a id="l4743"></a>Daniel sealed it untill the time of the end; &amp;  untill that <a id="l4744"></a>time comes, the Lamb is opening the  seals:  &amp; afterwards the <a id="l4745"></a>two witnesses prophesy out of it a long time in sack<a id="l4746"></a>cloth , before they ascend up to heaven in a cloud. All <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p099r"> &lt;99r&gt; </span> which is as much as to say, that these prophecies of Daniel <a id="l4747"></a>&amp; Iohn should not be understood till the time of the end: <a id="l4748"></a>but then some should prophesy out of them in an afflicted &amp; <a id="l4749"></a>mournfull state for a long time, &amp; that but darkly, <a id="l4750"></a>so as to convert but few. But in the very end, the prophe<a id="l4751"></a>sy should be so far interpreted as to convince many. <em class="underline">Then</em>, <a id="l4752"></a>saith Daniel, <em class="underline">many shall run to &amp; fro, &amp; knowledge shall <a id="l4753"></a>be increased</em>. For the Gospel must be preached in all <a id="l4754"></a>nations before the great tribulation, &amp; end of the world.  The palm-bearing multitude, which come out of this great tribulation, cannot be innumerable out of all nations, unless they be made so by the preaching of the Gospel before it comes. There must be a stone cut out of a mountain without hands, before it can fall upon the toes of the Image, &amp; become a great mountain &amp; fill the earth. An Angel must <a id="l4755"></a>fly thro' the midst of heaven with the everlasting Gospel <a id="l4756"></a>to preach to all nations, before Babylon falls, &amp; the son <a id="l4757"></a>of man reaps his harvest. The two Prophets must ascend <a id="l4758"></a>up to heaven in a cloud, before the kingdoms of this <a id="l4759"></a>world become the kingdoms of Christ. 'Tis therefore <a id="l4760"></a>a part of the Prophesy, that it is not to be understood <a id="l4761"></a>before the last age of the world; &amp; therefore it makes <a id="l4762"></a>for the credit of the Prophesy, that it is not yet un<a id="l4763"></a>derstood. But if the last age, the age of opening these <a id="l4764"></a>things, be now approaching, (as by the great successes of <a id="l4765"></a>late Interpreters it seems to be,) we have more encou<a id="l4766"></a>ragement than ever to look into these things. If the <a id="l4767"></a>general preaching of the Gospel be approaching, <a id="l4768"></a>it is to us &amp; our posterity that those words mainly <a id="l4769"></a>belong: <sup class="note" id="n243-ref">[243]</sup> <sup class="note" id="n244-ref">[244]</sup><em class="underline">In the time of the end <a id="l4771"></a>the wise shall understand, but none of the wicked <a id="l4772"></a>shall understand. Blessed is he that readeth, &amp; they <a id="l4773"></a>that  hear the words of this Prophesy, &amp; <a id="l4774"></a>keep those things which are written therein.</em></p>
<p id="par240">The folly of Interpreters has been, to foretell <a id="l4775"></a>times &amp; things by this Prophecy, as if God designed to make <a id="l4776"></a>them Prophets.  By this rashness they have not only <a id="l4777"></a>exposed themselves, but brought the Prophesy it self <a id="l4778"></a>into contempt. The designe of God was much otherwise. <a id="l4779"></a>He gave this &amp; the Prophesies of the old Testament, not to gratify men's curiosities by enabling them to foreknow things, but that <a id="l4780"></a>after they were fulfilled they might be interpreted by <a id="l4781"></a>the event, &amp; his own Providence (not the Interpreters) then <a id="l4782"></a>manifested thereby to the world. For the  event of <a id="l4783"></a>things  predicted many ages before, will then be a convincing argument that the <a id="l4784"></a>world is governed by providence. For as the few &amp; obscure <a id="l4785"></a>prophesies concerning Christ's first coming were for setting <a id="l4786"></a>up the Christian religion, which all nations have since <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p100r"> &lt;100r&gt; </span> corrupted; so the many &amp; clear prophesies concerning the <a id="l4787"></a>things to be done at Christ's second coming, are not only <a id="l4788"></a>for predicting but also for effecting a recovery &amp; <a id="l4789"></a>reestablishment of the long-lost truth, &amp; setting up  a <a id="l4790"></a>kingdome wherein dwells righteousness. The event will <a id="l4791"></a>prove the Apocalypse; &amp; this prophesy, thus proved &amp; un<a id="l4792"></a>derstood, will open all the old Prophets, &amp; all together will <a id="l4793"></a>make known the true religion, &amp; establish it. For he that <a id="l4794"></a>will understand the old Prophets, must begin with this. <a id="l4795"></a>But the time is not come for understanding them <a id="l4796"></a>perfectly, because the main revolution predicted in them <a id="l4797"></a>is not yet come to pass. <em class="underline">In the voice of the seventh <a id="l4798"></a>Angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of <a id="l4799"></a>God shall be finished, as he hath declared to his ser<a id="l4800"></a>vants the Prophets:</em> &amp; then <em class="underline">the Kingdoms of this world shall <a id="l4801"></a>become the kingdoms of our Lord &amp; his Christ, &amp; he shall <a id="l4802"></a>reign for ever</em> Apoc 10 &amp; 11. There is already so much <a id="l4803"></a>of the Prophesy fulfilled, that as many as will take <a id="l4804"></a>pains  in this study, may see sufficient instances of <a id="l4805"></a>God's providence: but then the signal revolutions predicted <a id="l4806"></a>by all the holy Prophets, will at once both turn mens <a id="l4807"></a>eyes upon considering the predictions, &amp; plainly inter<a id="l4808"></a>pret them. Till then we must content our selves with <a id="l4809"></a>interpreting what  hath been already fulfilled.</p>
<p id="par241">Amongst the Interpreters of the last age there <a id="l4810"></a>is scarce one of note who hath not made some dis<a id="l4811"></a>covery  worth knowing; &amp; thence  it seems  one may<sup class="note" id="n245-ref">[245]</sup> gather <a id="l4812"></a>that God is about opening these mysteries. The suc<a id="l4813"></a>cess of others put me upon considering it; &amp; if I <a id="l4814"></a>have done any thing which may be usefull to fol<a id="l4815"></a>lowing writers, I have any design.</p>

<p id="par243">On the first day of that month the High Priest dressed the Lamps <a id="l4822"></a>in the morning. And this is alluded unto in the first Vision where the Son <a id="l4823"></a>of man in the habit of the High Priest appears (or over against) the midst <a id="l4824"></a>of the seven candlesticks with seven starrs in his right hand, which are <a id="l4825"></a>the seven lamps appearing like a rod of seven starrs as it were in his <a id="l4826"></a>right hand while he dresses them. And this dressing is performed by <a id="l4827"></a>sending seven Epistles to the Angels of the seven Churches represented <a id="l4828"></a>by the Seven Candlesticks. ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 101v &gt; </span>✝ or Angels of the seven Churches<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 101r resumes &gt; </span>. These Epistles contein admonitions against <a id="l4829"></a>the approaching Apostacy, &amp; therefore relate to the times when the <a id="l4830"></a>Apostacy began to work strongly &amp; before it prevailed. It began <a id="l4831"></a>to work in the Apostle days, &amp; was to continue working <em class="underline">till the man <a id="l4832"></a>of sin should be revealed</em>. It began to work in the disciples of <a id="l4833"></a>Simon, Menander, Carpocrates, Cerinthus &amp; such sorts of men as <a id="l4834"></a>had imbided the Metaphysical philosophy of the Gentiles &amp; Caba<a id="l4835"></a>listical Iews &amp; were thence called Gnosticks. Iohn calls them <a id="l4836"></a>Antichrists saying that in his days there were many Antichrists. But <a id="l4837"></a>these men being condemned by the Apostles &amp; their immediate disciples, put the <a id="l4838"></a>Churches in no danger during the opening of the first four Seals. <a id="l4839"></a> The visions at the opening of these Seales relate <a id="l4840"></a>only to the civil affairs of the heathen Roman Empire. So long <a id="l4841"></a>the Apostolic traditions prevailed &amp; preserved the Church in <a id="l4842"></a>its purity. And therefore the affairs of the Church do not begin to <a id="l4843"></a>be considered in this Prophesy before the opening of the fift <a id="l4844"></a>Seal. She began then to decline &amp; to want admonitions, &amp; there<a id="l4845"></a>fore is admonished by these Epistles till the Apostacy prevailed &amp; <a id="l4846"></a>took place which was at the opening of the seventh seal. So then <a id="l4847"></a>the admonitions in these seven Epistles relate to the state of <a id="l4848"></a>the Church in the times of the fift and sixt seals. At the opening <a id="l4849"></a>of the fift Seal <sup class="note" id="n247-ref">[247]</sup>[the Church is purged from hypocrites by a <a id="l4850"></a>great persecution. At the opening of the sixt, that which <a id="l4851"></a>letted is taken out of the way, namely the heathen Roman <a id="l4852"></a>Empire. At the opening of the seventh, the Man of Sin is <a id="l4853"></a>revealed. And to these times the seven Epistles relate.</p>
<p id="par244">The seven Angels, to whom these Epistles were written, <a id="l4854"></a>answer to the seven Amarcelim, who were Priests &amp; chief <a id="l4855"></a>Officers of the Temple, &amp; had jointly the keys of the gates of <a id="l4856"></a>the Temple, &amp; also those of the Treasuries, &amp; the direction, <a id="l4857"></a>appointment &amp; oversight of all things in the Temple.</p>

The <a id="l4888"></a>people of Israel in the Wilderness encamped round about the <a id="l4889"></a>Tabernacle, &amp; on the east side were three tribes under the <a id="l4890"></a>standard of Iudah, on the west were three tribes under the <a id="l4891"></a>standard of Ephraim, on the south were three Tribes under <a id="l4892"></a>the standard of Reuben, &amp; on the north were three tribes <a id="l4893"></a>under the standard of Dan. Num. 2. And the standard of Iudah <a id="l4894"></a>was a Lion, that of Ephraim an Ox, that of Reuben a man, &amp; that <a id="l4895"></a>of Dan an Eagle, as the Iews affirm. Whence were framed the <a id="l4896"></a>hieroglyphicks of Cherubims &amp; Seraphims, to represent the people <a id="l4897"></a>of Israel. A Cherubim had one body wiith four faces, the faces of <a id="l4898"></a>a Lion, Ox, Man &amp; Eagle, looking to the four winds of heaven, <a id="l4899"></a>without turning about, as in Ezekiels Vision, ch. 1. And four <a id="l4900"></a>Seraphims had the same four faces with four bodies, one face <a id="l4901"></a>to every body. The four Beasts are therefore four Seraphims <a id="l4902"></a>standing in the four sides of the peoples court, the first in <a id="l4903"></a>the eastern side with the head of  a Lion, the second <a id="l4904"></a>in the western side with the head of an Ox, the third in the <a id="l4905"></a>southern side with the head of a Man, the fourth in the nor<a id="l4906"></a>thern side with the head of an Eagle: &amp; all four signify <a id="l4907"></a>all the twelve tribes of Israel, out of whom the hundred forty <a id="l4908"></a>&amp; four thousand were sealed, Apoc VII.4. <em class="underline">And the four Beasts <a id="l4909"></a>had each of them six wings</em>, two to a Tribe, in all twenty &amp; <a id="l4910"></a>four wings, answering to the twenty &amp; four stations of the <a id="l4911"></a>people. <em class="underline">And they were full of eyes within</em>, or under their <a id="l4912"></a>wings. <em class="underline">And they rest not day &amp; night</em> (or at the morning &amp; <a id="l4913"></a>evening sacrifices) <em class="underline">saying, Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty, <a id="l4914"></a>which was, &amp; is, &amp; is to come</em>.

And <a id="l4996"></a>an Angel</em> [the High Priest] <em class="underline">stood at the Altar, having a golden Censer; &amp; <a id="l4997"></a>there was given him much incense, that he should offer it with the <a id="l4998"></a>prayers of all saints, upon the golden Altar which was before the throne</em>. <a id="l4999"></a>The custom was on other days, for one of the Priests to take fire <a id="l5000"></a>from the great Altar in a silver Censer; but on this day, for the <a id="l5001"></a>High Priest to take fire from the great Altar in a golden Censer. <a id="l5002"></a>And when he was come down from the great Altar, he took incense <a id="l5003"></a>from one of the Priests  who brought it to him, &amp; went with it to the golden <a id="l5004"></a>Altar: &amp; while he offered the incense, the people prayed without <a id="l5005"></a>in silence, which is the silence in heaven for half an hour. And <a id="l5006"></a>when the High Priest had laid the incense on the Altar, he <a id="l5007"></a>carried a Censer of it burning in his hand, into the most holy place <a id="l5008"></a>before the Ark. <em class="underline">And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers <a id="l5009"></a>of the saints, ascended up before God out of the Angels hand <a id="l5010"></a></em>. On other days there was  a certain measure <a id="l5011"></a>of incense for the golden Altar: on this day there <sup class="note" id="n252-ref">[252]</sup>[was a greater <a id="l5012"></a>quantity for both the Altar &amp; the most Holy, &amp; therefore it is <a id="l5013"></a>called <em class="underline">much incense</em>. After this the Angel took the Censer, <a id="l5014"></a>&amp; filled it with fire from the  (great) Altar, &amp; <a id="l5015"></a>cast it to the earth; that is, by the hands of the Priests who <a id="l5016"></a>belong to his mystical body, he cast it to the earth without <a id="l5017"></a>the Temple, for burning the Goat which was the Lord's lot. <a id="l5018"></a><em class="underline">And</em> at this &amp; other concomitant sacrifices, untill the evening <a id="l5019"></a>sacrifice was ended, <em class="underline">there were voices, &amp; thunderings, &amp; light<a id="l5020"></a>nings, &amp; an earthquake</em>; that is, the voice of the High-<a id="l5021"></a>Priest reading the Law to the people, &amp; other voices and <a id="l5022"></a>thundrings of the Trumpets &amp; temple-musick at the <a id="l5023"></a>sacrifices, &amp; lightnings of the fire of the Altar.</p>
<p id="par249">X The solemnity of the day of Expiation being finished, the <a id="l5024"></a>seven Angels sound their Trumpets at the great sacrifices of the <a id="l5025"></a>seven days of the feast of Tabernacles; &amp; at the same sacrifices, <a id="l5026"></a>the seven thunders utter their voices, which are Musick of <a id="l5027"></a>the Temple, &amp; singing of the Levites, intermixed with the <a id="l5028"></a>soudings of the Trumpets: &amp; the seven Angels pour out <a id="l5029"></a>their Viols of wrath, which are the drink-offerings of those <a id="l5030"></a>sacrifices.</p>
<p id="par250">When six of the Seals were opened, Iohn said: <sup class="note" id="n253-ref">[253]</sup><em class="underline">And after <a id="l5031"></a>these things</em> [that is, after the visions of the sixth Seal] <em class="underline">I saw <a id="l5032"></a>four Angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding <a id="l5033"></a>the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow <a id="l5034"></a>on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw ano<a id="l5035"></a>ther Angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the <a id="l5036"></a>living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four Angels, <a id="l5037"></a>to whom it was given to hurt the earth &amp; the sea, saying, Hurt <a id="l5038"></a>not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed <a id="l5039"></a>the servants of our God in their foreheads</em>. This sealing alludes <a id="l5040"></a>to a tradition of the Iews, that upon the day of Expiation all <a id="l5041"></a>the people of Israel are sealed up in the books of life &amp; death. <a id="l5042"></a>For the Iews in their Talmud tell us, <sup class="note" id="n254-ref">[254]</sup>that in the beginning of <a id="l5043"></a>every new year, or first day of the month Tisri, (the seventh <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p105r"> &lt;105r&gt; </span> month of the sacred year) three books were opened in <a id="l5044"></a>judgment; the book of life, in which the names of those are written <a id="l5045"></a>who are perfectly just; the book of death, in which the names of <a id="l5046"></a>those are written who are Atheists or very wicked; &amp; a <a id="l5047"></a>third book, of those whose judgment is suspended till the day <a id="l5048"></a>of  Expiation, &amp; whose names are not written in the book <a id="l5049"></a>of life or death before that day. The first ten days of this <a id="l5050"></a>month they call the penitential days; &amp; all these days they <a id="l5051"></a>fast &amp; pray very much, &amp; are very devout, that on the tenth <a id="l5052"></a>day their sins may be remitted, &amp; their names may be written <a id="l5053"></a>in the Book of life, which day is therefore called the day of <a id="l5054"></a>Expiation. And upon this tenth day, in returning home  <a id="l5055"></a>from the Synagogues, they say to one another, <em class="underline">God the creator <a id="l5056"></a>seal you to a good year</em>. For they conceive that the books <a id="l5057"></a>are now sealed up, &amp; that the sentence of God remains <a id="l5058"></a>unchanged hence forward to the end of the year. And <a id="l5059"></a>the same thing is signified by the two Goats, upon whose foreheads <a id="l5060"></a>the High Priest yearly, on the day of expiation, lays the two <a id="l5061"></a>lots inscribed, <em class="underline">For God</em> &amp; <em class="underline">For Azazel</em>; God's lot signifying <a id="l5062"></a>the people who are sealed with the name of God in their <a id="l5063"></a>foreheads; &amp; the lot <em class="underline">Azazel</em>, which was sent into the wilderness, <a id="l5064"></a>representing those who receive the mark &amp; name of the Beast, &amp; go <a id="l5065"></a>into the wilderness with the great Whore.</p>
<p id="par251">The servants of God being therefore sealed in the day of <a id="l5066"></a>expiation, conceive that this sealing is synchronal to the <a id="l5067"></a>visions which appear upon opening the seventh seal; &amp; that <a id="l5068"></a>when the lamb had opened six of the seals &amp; seen the visions <a id="l5069"></a>relating to the inside of the sixth, he looked on the backside <a id="l5070"></a>of the seventh leaf, &amp; then saw the four angels holding the <a id="l5071"></a>four winds of heaven, &amp; another Angel ascending from <a id="l5072"></a>the east with the seal of God. Conceive also, that the Angels <a id="l5073"></a>which held the four winds were the first four of the seven <a id="l5074"></a>Angels, who upon opening the seventh seal were seen standing <a id="l5075"></a>before God; &amp; that upon their holding the blustering noisy <a id="l5076"></a>winds, there was silence in heaven for half an hour; <a id="l5077"></a>&amp; that while the servants of God were sealing, the Angel <a id="l5078"></a>with the golden Censer offered their prayers with in<a id="l5079"></a>cense upon the golden Altar, &amp; read the Law: &amp; that <a id="l5080"></a>so soon as they were sealed, the winds hurt the Earth at <a id="l5081"></a>the sounding of the first Trumpet, &amp; the sea at the sound<a id="l5082"></a>ing of the second; these winds signifying the warrs, to which <a id="l5083"></a>the first four Trumpets sounded. For as the first four Seals <a id="l5084"></a>are distinguished from the three last by the appearance of four <a id="l5085"></a>horsmen towards the four winds of heaven; so the wars of <a id="l5086"></a>the first four Trumpets are distinguished from those of the <a id="l5087"></a>three last, by representing these by four winds, &amp; the others <a id="l5088"></a>by three great Woes.</p>
<p id="par252">In one of Ezekiel's Visions, when the Babylonian cap<a id="l5089"></a>tivity was at hand, six men appeared with slaughter weapons; <a id="l5090"></a>&amp; a seventh, who appeared among them clothed in white linen <a id="l5091"></a>&amp; a writer's inkhorn by his side, is commanded to go thro' the <a id="l5092"></a>midst of Ierusalem, &amp; set a mark on the foreheads of the men <a id="l5093"></a>who sigh &amp; cry for all the abominations done in the midst there<a id="l5094"></a>of: &amp; then the six men (like the Angels of the first six Trum<a id="l5095"></a>pets) are commanded to slay those men who are not marked. <a id="l5096"></a>Conceive therefore that the hundred  forty &amp; four thousand are <a id="l5097"></a>sealed, to preserve them from the plagues of the first six Trumpets, <a id="l5098"></a>&amp; that at length by the preaching of the everlasting gospel to all <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p106r"> &lt;106r&gt; </span> nations they grow into a great multitude, &amp; at the sounding of <a id="l5099"></a>the seventh Trumpet come out of the great tribulation with Palms <a id="l5100"></a>in their hands: the kingdoms of this world, by the war to which that <a id="l5101"></a>Trumpet sounds, becoming the kingdoms of God &amp; Christ. For the <a id="l5102"></a>solemnity of the great Hosannah was kept by the Iews upon <a id="l5103"></a>the seventh or last day of the Feast of Tabernacles;  the Iews <a id="l5104"></a>upon that day carrying Palms in their hands, &amp; crying Hosannah.</p>
<p id="par253">After six of the Angels (answering to the six men with <a id="l5105"></a>slaughter-weapons) had sounded their Trumpets, the Lamb in the form <a id="l5106"></a>of <em class="underline">a mighty Angel came down from heaven clothed with a cloud, <a id="l5107"></a>&amp; a rainbow upon his head, &amp; his face was as it were the sun, &amp; his <a id="l5108"></a>feet as pillars of fire</em> [the shape in which Christ appeared in the <a id="l5109"></a>beginning of this Prophesy,] <em class="underline">&amp; he had in his hand a little book open</em>; <a id="l5110"></a>[the book which he had newly opened; For he received but one book <a id="l5111"></a>from him that sitteth upon the throne, &amp; he alone was worthy to <a id="l5112"></a>open &amp; look on this Book.] <em class="underline">And he set his  right foot on the sea &amp; <a id="l5113"></a>his left foot on the earth, &amp; cried with a loud voice, as when a lyon <a id="l5114"></a>roareth.</em> It was the custome for the High Priest on the day of ex<a id="l5115"></a>piation, to stand in an elevated place in the peoples court, at the <a id="l5116"></a>eastern gate of the Priests court, &amp; read the Law to the people, while <a id="l5117"></a>the Heifer &amp; the Goat which was the Lord's lot, were burning without <a id="l5118"></a>the Temple.  We may suppose him standing in such a manner, that his <a id="l5119"></a>right foot might appear to Iohn as it were standing on the Sea of <a id="l5120"></a>glass, &amp; his left foot on the ground of the House; &amp; that he cried <a id="l5121"></a>with a loud voice, in reading the Law on the day of Expiation. <a id="l5122"></a><em class="underline">And when he cried, seven thunders uttered their voices</em>. Thunders <a id="l5123"></a>are the voice of a cloud, &amp; a cloud signifies a multitude; &amp; this mul<a id="l5124"></a>titude may be the Levites who sang with thundering voices, &amp; played <a id="l5125"></a>with musical instruments at the great sacrifices, on the seven <a id="l5126"></a>days of the feast of Tabernacles: at which times the Trumpets also <a id="l5127"></a>sounded. For the Trumpets sounded, &amp; the Levites sang alternately, <a id="l5128"></a>three times at every sacrifice. And therefore the Prophecy of the <a id="l5129"></a>seven Thunders is nothing else then a repetition of the Prophecy <a id="l5130"></a>of the seven Trumpets in another form. <em class="underline">And the Angel which I <a id="l5131"></a>saw stand upon the sea &amp; upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, <a id="l5132"></a>&amp; sware by him that liveth for ever &amp; ever, that</em> [after the seven <a id="l5133"></a>thunders] <em class="underline">there should be time no longer; but in the days of the <a id="l5134"></a>voice of the seventh Angel, when he shall begin to sound, the <a id="l5135"></a>mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his ser<a id="l5136"></a>vants the Prophets</em>. The voices of the Thunders therefore last to the <a id="l5137"></a>end of this world, &amp; so do those of the Trumpets.</p>
<p id="par254"><em class="underline">And the voice which I heard from heaven</em>, saith Iohn, <em class="underline">spake to me <a id="l5138"></a>again &amp; said, Go &amp; take the little Book, &amp;c. And I took the little Book <a id="l5139"></a>out of the Angel's hand, &amp; ate it up; &amp; it was in my mouth sweet <a id="l5140"></a>as honey, &amp; as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And <a id="l5141"></a>he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, <a id="l5142"></a>&amp; nations, &amp; tongues, &amp; kings</em>. This is an Introduction to a new pro<a id="l5143"></a>phecy, to a repetition of the Prophecy of the whole book, &amp; alludes <a id="l5144"></a>to Ezekiel's eating a roll or book spred open before him, &amp; written <a id="l5145"></a>within &amp; without,  full of lamentations &amp; mourning &amp; wo, but sweet <a id="l5146"></a>in his mouth. Eating &amp; drinking signify acquiring &amp; possessing; &amp; <a id="l5147"></a>eating the book is becoming inspired with the prophecy contained <a id="l5148"></a>in it. It implies being inspired in a vigorous &amp; extraordinary <a id="l5149"></a>manner with the prophecy of the whole book, &amp; therefore sig<a id="l5150"></a>nifies a lively repetition of the whole prophesy by way of in<a id="l5151"></a>terpretation, &amp; begins not till the first Prophesy, that of the <a id="l5152"></a>Seals &amp; Trumpets, is ended. It was sweet in Iohn's mouth, <a id="l5153"></a>&amp; therefore begins not with the bitter prophesy of the Babylo<a id="l5154"></a>nian captivity, &amp; the Gentiles being in the outward court of <a id="l5155"></a>the Temple, &amp; treading the holy city under foot, &amp; the prophesying <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p107r"> &lt;107r&gt; </span> of the two Witnesses in sackcloth, &amp; their smiting the earth with <a id="l5156"></a>all plagues, &amp; being killed by the Beast: but so soon as the prophesy <a id="l5157"></a>of the Trumpets is ended, it begins with the sweet prophesy of the <a id="l5158"></a>glorious woman in heaven, &amp; the victory of Michael over the Dra<a id="l5159"></a>gon; &amp; after that, it is bitter in Iohn's belly, by a large description <a id="l5160"></a>of the times of the great Apostasy.</p>
<p id="par255"><em class="underline">And the Angel stood</em> [upon the Earth &amp; Sea] <em class="underline">saying, Rise <a id="l5161"></a>and measure the Temple of God &amp; the Altar, &amp; them that <a id="l5162"></a>worship therein</em>, that is, their Courts with the buildings thereon, <a id="l5163"></a>viz the square court of the Temple called the Separate place, <a id="l5164"></a>&amp; the square court of the Altar called the Priests Court, &amp; the <a id="l5165"></a>Court of them that worship in the Temple called the new <a id="l5166"></a>Court: <em class="underline">but the</em> [great] <em class="underline">Court which is without the Temple, leave out <a id="l5167"></a>&amp; measure it not, for it is given to the Gentiles, &amp; the Holy City <a id="l5168"></a>shall they tread under foot forty &amp; two months</em>. This measuring <a id="l5169"></a>hath reference to Ezekiel's measuring the Temple of Solomon: <a id="l5170"></a>There the whole Temple (including the outward Court) <sup class="note" id="n255-ref">[255]</sup>[was mea<a id="l5171"></a>sured, to signify that it should be rebuilt in the latter days. <a id="l5172"></a>Here the Courts of the Temple &amp; Altar, &amp; them  who worship <a id="l5173"></a>therein, are only measured, to signify the building of a second <a id="l5174"></a>Temple, for those that are sealed out of all the twelve tribes <a id="l5175"></a>of Israel, &amp; worship in the inward Court of sincerity &amp; truth: <a id="l5176"></a>&amp; Iohn is commanded to leave out the outward Court, or out<a id="l5177"></a>ward form of religion &amp; Church-Government, because it is gi<a id="l5178"></a>ven to the Babylonian Gentiles. For the glorious Woman in <a id="l5179"></a>heaven, the remnant of whose seed kept the commandments <a id="l5180"></a>of God, &amp; had the testimony of Iesus, continued the same wo<a id="l5181"></a>man in outward form after her flight into the wilderness, <a id="l5182"></a>whereby she quitted her former sincerity &amp; piety, &amp; became the <a id="l5183"></a>great Whore. She lost her chastity, but kept her outward form <a id="l5184"></a>&amp; shape. And while the Gentiles tread the holy city under foot, <a id="l5185"></a>&amp; worship in the outward Court, the two Witnesses (represented <a id="l5186"></a>perhaps by the two feet of the Angel standing on the sea  <a id="l5187"></a>&amp; earth) prophesied against them, and had power, like Elijah <a id="l5188"></a>&amp; Moses, to consume their enemies with fire proceeding out of <a id="l5189"></a>their mouth, &amp; to stop heaven that is rain not in the days of <a id="l5190"></a>their prophesy, &amp; to turn the waters into blood, &amp; to smite the <a id="l5191"></a>earth with all plagues as often as they will, that is, with <a id="l5192"></a>the plagues of the  Trumpets &amp; Vials of wrath; &amp; at length <a id="l5193"></a>they are slain, rise again from the dead, &amp; ascend up to heaven <a id="l5194"></a>in a cloud, &amp; then the seventh Trumpet sounds to the day of <a id="l5195"></a>judgment.</p>
<p id="par256">The Prophesy being finished, Iohn is inspired anew by the eaten <a id="l5196"></a>book, &amp; begins the Interpretation thereof with the words, <em class="underline">And the Temple <a id="l5197"></a>of God was opened in heaven, &amp; there was seen in his Temple the Ark <a id="l5198"></a>of the testament</em>. By the Ark, you may know that this was the first <a id="l5199"></a>Temple; for the second Temple had no Ark. <em class="underline">And there were lightnings, <a id="l5200"></a>&amp; voices, &amp; thundrings, &amp; an earthquake, &amp; great hail</em>. These <a id="l5201"></a>answer to the wars in the Roman Empire, during the reign of <a id="l5202"></a>the four horsemen who appeared upon opening the first four Seals. <a id="l5203"></a><em class="underline">And there appeared a great wonder in heaven, A Woman clothed <a id="l5204"></a>with the Sun</em>. In the Prophecy, the affairs of the Church begin to be <a id="l5205"></a>considered at the opening of the fifth Seal; &amp; in the Interpretation, they <a id="l5206"></a>begin at the same time with the Vision of the Church in the form <a id="l5207"></a>of a Woman in heaven. There she is persecuted, &amp; here she is <a id="l5208"></a>pained in travail. The Interpretation proceeds down first to the <a id="l5209"></a>sealing of the servants of God, &amp; marking the rest with the mark of <a id="l5210"></a>the Beast; &amp; then to the day of judgment, represented by a harvest <a id="l5211"></a>&amp; vintage. Then it returns back to the times of opening the se<a id="l5212"></a>venth seal, &amp; interprets the prophesy of the seven Trumpets by <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p108r"> &lt;108r&gt; </span> the pouring out of seven Vials of wrath.  The Angels <a id="l5213"></a>who pour them out, come out of the Temple of the Taber<a id="l5214"></a>nacle; that is, out of the second Temple, for the Tabernacle <a id="l5215"></a>had no outward Court. Then it returns back again to the <a id="l5216"></a>times of measuring the Temple &amp; altar, &amp; of the gentiles <a id="l5217"></a>worshiping in the outward Court, &amp; of the Beast killing the <a id="l5218"></a>Witnesses in the street of the great city; &amp; interprets these <a id="l5219"></a>things by the Vision of a Woman sitting on the Beast, drunken <a id="l5220"></a>with the blood of Saints; &amp; proceeds in the Interpretation <a id="l5221"></a>downwards to the fall of the great city &amp; the day of judgment.</p>
<p id="par257">The whole prophesy of the Book, ×× represented by the book of the Law, is there<a id="l5222"></a>fore repeated, &amp; interpreted in the Visions which follow those <a id="l5223"></a>of sounding the seventh Trumpet, &amp; begin with that of the <a id="l5224"></a>Temple of God opened in heaven.

<p id="par260">The third &amp; fourth Beasts of Daniel are the same with the <a id="l5246"></a>Dragon &amp; ten-horned Beast of Iohn, but with this difference: <a id="l5247"></a>Iohn puts the Dragon for the whole Roman Empire while it <a id="l5248"></a>continued entire, because it was entire when that Prophesy was <a id="l5249"></a>given; &amp; the Beast he considers not till the Empire became di<a id="l5250"></a>vided: &amp; then he puts the Dragon for the Empire of the Greeks, <a id="l5251"></a>&amp; the Beast for the Empire of the Latines.  Hence it is <a id="l5252"></a>that the Dragon &amp; Beast have common heads &amp; common horns: <a id="l5253"></a>But the Dragon hath crowns only upon his heads, &amp; the Beast <a id="l5254"></a>only upon his horns; because the Beast &amp; his horns reigned <a id="l5255"></a>not before they were divided from the Dragon: &amp; when the <a id="l5256"></a>Dragon gave the Beast his throne, the ten horns received <a id="l5257"></a>power as kings, the same hour with the Beast. The heads <a id="l5258"></a>are seven successive kings.<sup class="note" id="n256-ref">[256]</sup> Four of them were the four <a id="l5259"></a>horsmen which appeared at the opening of the first four <a id="l5260"></a>seals. In the latter end of the sixt head, or seal, considered <a id="l5261"></a>as present in the visions, it is said, <em class="underline">Five</em> of the seven kings <a id="l5262"></a><em class="underline">are fallen, &amp; one is, &amp; another is not yet come; &amp; the Beast <a id="l5263"></a>that was &amp; is not</em>, (being wounded to death with a sword) <a id="l5264"></a><em class="underline">he is the eighth, &amp; of the seven</em>. He was therefore a collate<a id="l5265"></a>ral part of the seventh. The horns are the same with <a id="l5266"></a>those of Daniel's fourth Beast, described above.</p>
<p id="par261">The four horsmen which appear at the opening of the <a id="l5267"></a>first four Seals, have been well explained by M<sup>r</sup> Mead; <a id="l5268"></a>excepting that I had rather continue the third to the end <a id="l5269"></a>of the reign of the three Gordians &amp; Philip the Arabian,<sup class="note" id="n257-ref">[257]</sup> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p110r"> &lt;110r&gt; </span> those being kings from the south, &amp; begin the fourth with the reign <a id="l5270"></a>of Decius, &amp; continue it till the reign of Dioclesian. For the fourth <a id="l5271"></a>horsman <em class="underline">sat upon a pale</em> horse, <em class="underline">&amp; his name was Death; &amp; Hell followed <a id="l5272"></a>with him; &amp; power was given them to kill unto the fourth part of the <a id="l5273"></a>earth, with the sword, &amp; with famine, &amp; with the plague, &amp; with the <a id="l5274"></a>Beasts of the earth</em>, or armies of invaders &amp; rebels: &amp; such were <a id="l5275"></a>the times during all this interval. Hitherto the Roman Empire <a id="l5276"></a>continued in an undivided monarchical form, except rebellions; &amp; <a id="l5277"></a>such it is represented by the four horsmen. But Dioclesian divided <a id="l5278"></a>it between himself &amp; Maximianus, A.C. 285; &amp; it continued in that <a id="l5279"></a>divided state, till the victory of Constantine the great over Licinius, <a id="l5280"></a>A.C. 323, which put an end to the heathen persecutions set on <a id="l5281"></a>foot by Dioclesian &amp; Maximianus, &amp; described at the opening of <a id="l5282"></a>the fift seal. But this division of the Empire was imperfect, <a id="l5283"></a>the whole being still under one &amp; the same Senate. The same <a id="l5284"></a>victory of  Constantine over Licinius a heathen persecutor, <a id="l5285"></a>began the fall of the heathen empire, described at the opening <a id="l5286"></a>of the sixt seal. And the visions of this seal continue till <a id="l5287"></a>after the reign of Iulian the Apostate, he being a heathen <a id="l5288"></a>emperor, &amp; reigning over the whole Roman Empire.</p>
<p id="par262">V The affairs of the Church begin to be considered at the open<a id="l5289"></a>ing of the fift Seal, as was said above.  Then she is represented <a id="l5290"></a>by a Woman in the Temple of heaven, clothed with the Sun of righte<a id="l5291"></a>ousness, &amp; the Moon of Iewish ceremonies under her feet, &amp; upon <a id="l5292"></a>her head a crown of twelve stars relating to the twelve Apostels <a id="l5293"></a>&amp; tp the twelve tribes of Israel. When she fled from the Temple <a id="l5294"></a>into the wilderness, she left in the Temple a remnant of her <a id="l5295"></a>seed, who kept the commandments of God, &amp; had the testimony <a id="l5296"></a>of Iesus; &amp; therefore before her flight she represented the true <a id="l5297"></a>primitive Church of God, tho afterwards she degenerated <a id="l5298"></a>like Aholah &amp; Aholibah. In Dioclesian's persecution she cried, <a id="l5299"></a>travelling in birth, &amp; pained to be delivered. And in the end of <a id="l5300"></a>that persecution, by the victory of Constantine over Maxen<a id="l5301"></a>tius A.C. 312, she brought forth a Man-child, such a child <a id="l5302"></a>as was to rule all nations with a rod of iron, a Christian Empire. <a id="l5303"></a>And her child, by the victory of Constantine over Licinius, A.C. <a id="l5304"></a>323, was caught up to God &amp; to his throne. And the Woman, by <a id="l5305"></a>the division of the Roman Empire into the Greek &amp; Latin empires, <a id="l5306"></a>fled from the first temple into the wilderness, or spiritually <a id="l5307"></a>barren empire of the Latines, where she is found afterwards <a id="l5308"></a>sitting upon the Beast &amp; upon the seven mountains; &amp; is <a id="l5309"></a>called the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth, <a id="l5310"></a>that is, over the ten kings which give their kingdome to her <a id="l5311"></a>Beast.</p>
<p id="par263">But before her flight there was war in heaven between <a id="l5312"></a>Michael &amp; the Dragon, (the Christian &amp; heathen religions,); <a id="l5313"></a>&amp; the Dragon, <em class="underline">that old Serpent, called the devil &amp; Satan, who <a id="l5314"></a>deceiveth the whole world, was cast out to the earth, &amp; his <a id="l5315"></a>Angels were cast out with him</em>. And Iohn <em class="underline">heard a voice in <a id="l5316"></a>heaven saying, Now is come salvation &amp; strength, &amp; the king<a id="l5317"></a>dome of our God, &amp; the power of his Christ: For the accuser <a id="l5318"></a>of our brethren is cast down. And they overcame him by the <a id="l5319"></a>blood of the Lamb, &amp; by the word of their testimony. And they <a id="l5320"></a>loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore rejoyce ye <a id="l5321"></a>heavens, &amp; ye that dwell in them. Wo be to the inhabiters of <a id="l5322"></a>the earth &amp; sea</em> (or people of the Greek &amp; Latine Empires,) <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p111r"> &lt;111r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">for the Devil is come down amongst you, <sup class="note" id="n258-ref">[258]</sup>[having great wrath, <a id="l5323"></a>because he knoweth that he hath but a short time</em>.</p>
<p id="par264"><em class="underline">And when the Dragon saw that he was cast down</em> <a id="l5324"></a>from the Roman throne, &amp; the Man-child caught up thither, <a id="l5325"></a>he <em class="underline">persecuted the Woman which brought forth the Man-child, <a id="l5326"></a>&amp; to her</em> (by the division of the Roman Empire between the <a id="l5327"></a>cities of Rome &amp; Constantinople A.C. 330,) <em class="underline">were given two <a id="l5328"></a>wings of a great Eagle</em> (the symbol of the Roman Empire) <a id="l5329"></a><em class="underline">that she might fly</em> [from the  first Temple] <em class="underline">into the wil<a id="l5330"></a>derness</em> of Arabia, <em class="underline">to her place</em> at Babylon mystically so <a id="l5331"></a>called. <em class="underline">And  the Serpent</em> (by the division of the same Em<a id="l5332"></a>pire between the sons of Constantine the great, A.C. 337,) <em class="underline">cast <a id="l5333"></a>out of his mouth waters as a flood</em> (the western Empire) <a id="l5334"></a><em class="underline">after the Woman, that he might cause her to be carried <a id="l5335"></a>away by the [<sup class="note" id="n259-ref">[259]</sup>flood. And the earth</em> (or Greek Empire)  <em class="underline">helped the Woman, &amp; opened her mouth, &amp; swal<a id="l5337"></a>lowed up the] flood</em> (by the victory of Constantius over Mag<a id="l5338"></a>nentius, A.C. 353) &amp; thus the Beast was wounded to death <a id="l5339"></a>with a sword. <em class="underline">And the Dragon was wroth with the Woman</em>, <a id="l5340"></a>(in the reign of Iulian the Apostate A.C. 361) <em class="underline">and</em> (by a <a id="l5341"></a>new division of the Empire between Valentinian &amp; Valens, <a id="l5342"></a>A.C. 364) <em class="underline">went from her</em> [into the eastern Empire] <em class="underline">to make <a id="l5343"></a>war with the remnant of her seed</em>, which she left behind <a id="l5344"></a>her when she fled. And thus the Beast revived. And by the <a id="l5345"></a>next division of the Empire, which was between Gratian and <a id="l5346"></a>Theodosius A.C. 379, the <em class="underline">Beast</em> with ten horns <em class="underline">rose out of <a id="l5347"></a>the sea</em>, &amp; the <em class="underline">Beast</em> with two horns <em class="underline">out of the earth</em>; &amp; by <a id="l5348"></a>the last division thereof, which was between the sons of Theo<a id="l5349"></a>dosius, A.C. 395, <em class="underline">the Dragon gave the Beast his power and <a id="l5350"></a>throne, &amp; great authority</em>. And the ten horns <em class="underline">received power <a id="l5351"></a>as kings, the same hour with the Beast.</em></p>
<p id="par265">At length the Woman arrived at her place of temporal as <a id="l5352"></a>well as spiritual dominion upon the back of the Beast, where <a id="l5353"></a>she is nourished a time times &amp; half a time, from the face of the <a id="l5354"></a>serpent; not in his kingdom, but at a distance from him. She is <a id="l5355"></a>nourished by the Merchants of the earth, three times or years &amp; an <a id="l5356"></a>half, or 42 months, or 1260 days: &amp; in these prophecies days are <a id="l5357"></a>put for years. During all this time the Beast acted, &amp; she sat <a id="l5358"></a>upon him, that is, reigned over him, &amp; over the ten kings who gave <a id="l5359"></a>their kingdom to him; &amp; she was drunken with the blood of the <a id="l5360"></a>saints. And by all these circumstances she is the eleventh horn <a id="l5361"></a>of Daniel's fourth Beast, who reigned with a look more stout <a id="l5362"></a>then the other ten, &amp; was of a different kind from the rest, &amp; <a id="l5363"></a>had eyes &amp; a mouth like the Woman; &amp; made war with the <a id="l5364"></a>saints, &amp; prevailed against them, &amp; wore them out, &amp; changed <a id="l5365"></a>times &amp; laws, &amp; had them given into his hands untill a time <a id="l5366"></a>times &amp; half a time. The characters of the Woman, and <a id="l5367"></a>little horn of the Beast, agree perfectly. In respect of her <a id="l5368"></a>temporal dominion, she was a horn of the Beast; in respect <a id="l5369"></a>of her spiritual dominion, she rode upon him in the form <a id="l5370"></a>of a Woman, &amp; was his Church, &amp; committed fornication <a id="l5371"></a>with the ten kings.</p>
<p id="par266">And the second Beast, which rose up out of the earth, was <a id="l5372"></a>the Church of the Greek Empire: For it had two horns like those <a id="l5373"></a>of the Lamb, &amp; therefore was a church; &amp; it spake as the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p112r"> &lt;112r&gt; </span> Dragon, &amp; therefore was of his religion; &amp; it rose up out of the earth, <a id="l5374"></a>&amp; by consequence in his kingdom. It is called also the fals Prophet <a id="l5375"></a>that wrought miracles before the first Beast, by which he deceived them <a id="l5376"></a>that received his mark, &amp; worshiped his image. When the Dragon <a id="l5377"></a>went from the Woman to make war with the remnant of her <a id="l5378"></a>seed, this Beast arising out of the earth assisted in that war, &amp; <a id="l5379"></a>caused the earth &amp; them that dwell therein to worship the au<a id="l5380"></a>thority of the first Beast, whose mortal wound was healed, &amp; to <a id="l5381"></a>make an Image to him, that is, to assemble a body of man like him <a id="l5382"></a>in point of religion. And he had power to give life &amp; authority <a id="l5383"></a>to the Image, so that it could both speak, &amp; by dictating cause <a id="l5384"></a>that all  religious bodies of men, who would not worship the <a id="l5385"></a>authority of the Image, should be mystically killed. And he <a id="l5386"></a>causeth all men to receive a mark in their right hand or in <a id="l5387"></a>their forehead, &amp; that no man might buy or sell save he that <a id="l5388"></a>had the mark or the name of the Beast, or the number of his name; <a id="l5389"></a>all the rest being excommunicated by the Beast with two horns. <a id="l5390"></a>And his mark is ✝ ✝ ✝, &amp; his name ΛΑΤΕΙΝΟΣ, &amp; the num<a id="l5391"></a>ber of his name 6 6 6.</p>
<p id="par267">Thus the Beast, after he was wounded to death with a sword <a id="l5392"></a>&amp; revived, was deified, as the heathens used to deify their kings <a id="l5393"></a>after death, &amp; had an Image erected to him; &amp; his worshippers <a id="l5394"></a>were initiated in this new religion, by receiving the mark or <a id="l5395"></a>name of this new God, or the number of his name. And by <a id="l5396"></a>killing all that will not worship him &amp; his Image, the first <a id="l5397"></a>Temple,  illuminated by the lamps of the seven <a id="l5398"></a>churches, is demolished, &amp; a new Temple  built for them  who <a id="l5399"></a>will not worship him; &amp; the outward Court of this new Temple <a id="l5400"></a>(or outward form of a Church,) is given to the Gentiles, who <a id="l5401"></a>worship the Beast &amp; his Image. And they  who will not worship <a id="l5402"></a>him, are sealed with the name of God in their foreheads, &amp; <a id="l5403"></a>retire into the inward Court of this new Temple.  These <a id="l5404"></a>are the 144000 sealed out of all the twelve Tribes of Israel, <a id="l5405"></a>&amp; called the two Witnesses, as being derived from the two wings <a id="l5406"></a>of the Woman while she was flying into the Wilderness &amp; represented by two of the seven  candlesticks. These <a id="l5407"></a>appear to Iohn, in the inward Court of the second Temple, <a id="l5408"></a>standing on mount Sion with the Lamb, &amp; as it were on the <a id="l5409"></a>sea of glass. These are the saints of the most High, &amp; the <a id="l5410"></a>Host of heaven, &amp; the holy people spoken of by Daniel, as <a id="l5411"></a>worn out &amp; trampled under foot, &amp; destroyed in the latter <a id="l5412"></a>times by the little horns of his fourth Beast &amp; He-Goat.</p>
<p id="par268">And while the Gentiles tread the Holy city under foot; God <a id="l5413"></a>gives power to his two Witnesses, &amp; they prophesy in sackcloth <a id="l5414"></a>all the 1260 days. They are called the two Olive-trees, <a id="l5415"></a>with relation to the two Olive trees, which in Zechary's Vision (ch. 4) <a id="l5416"></a>stand on either side of the golden candlestick to supply the lamps <a id="l5417"></a>with oyle: &amp; Olive-trees, according to the Apostle Paul, represent <a id="l5418"></a>Churches, Rom. XI. They supply the lamps with oil, by maintaining <a id="l5419"></a>teachers. They are also called two Candlesticks; &amp; Candlesticks in this <a id="l5420"></a>Prophesy signify churches, the seven Churches of Asia being re<a id="l5421"></a>presented by seven Candlesticks. Five of these Churches were <a id="l5422"></a>found faulty, &amp; threatned if they did not repent; the other two <a id="l5423"></a>were without fault, &amp; so their Candlesticks were fit to be placed in <a id="l5424"></a>the second Temple. These were the Churches in Smyrna &amp; Phi<a id="l5425"></a>ladelphia. They were in a state of tribulation &amp; persecution, &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p113r"> &lt;113r&gt; </span> the only two of the seven in such a state: &amp; so their candle<a id="l5426"></a>sticks were fit to represent the Churches in affliction in the <a id="l5427"></a>times of the second Temple, &amp; the only two of the seven <a id="l5428"></a>that were fit. The two Witnesses are not new churches. <a id="l5429"></a>They are the posterity of the primitive Church, the poste<a id="l5430"></a>rity of the two wings of the Woman, &amp; so are fitly re<a id="l5431"></a>presented by two of the primitive Candlesticks. We may Conceive <a id="l5432"></a>therefore, that when the first Temple was destroyed, &amp; a new one built for them  who worship in the inward Court, <a id="l5434"></a>two of the seven Candlesticks were placed in this new <a id="l5435"></a>Temple.</p>

<p id="par270">The persecution of Dioclesian began in the year of <a id="l5516"></a>Christ 302, &amp; lasted ten years in the eastern Empire &amp; two <a id="l5517"></a>years in the western.  To this state of the Church the <a id="l5518"></a>second Epistle, that to the Church of Smyrna, agrees. <sup class="note" id="n263-ref">[263]</sup><em class="underline">I know</em>, <a id="l5519"></a>saith Christ, <em class="underline">thy works, &amp; tribulation, &amp; poverty, (but thou art <a id="l5520"></a>rich;) &amp; I know the blasphemy of them</em> (the Nicolaitans) <em class="underline">who <a id="l5521"></a>say they are Iews &amp; are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan. <a id="l5522"></a>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: Behold, <a id="l5523"></a>the Devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may <a id="l5524"></a>be tried; &amp; ye shall have tribulation ten days.

By the blasphemy of them that say <a id="l5529"></a>they are Iews &amp; are not, but are the synagogue of Satan, I <a id="l5530"></a>understand the Idolatry of the Nicolaitans, who falsly said <a id="l5531"></a>they were Christians.</p>
<p id="par271">The Nicolaitans are complained of also in the third <a id="l5532"></a>Epistle, as men that <sup class="note" id="n264-ref">[264]</sup><em class="underline">held the doctrine of Balaam, who taught <a id="l5533"></a>Balac</em> [the king] <em class="underline">to cast a stumbling-block before the chil<a id="l5534"></a>dren of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to Idols, &amp; to commit</em> <a id="l5535"></a>spiritual <em class="underline">fornication</em>.<sup class="note" id="n265-ref">[265]</sup> For Balaam taught the Moabites &amp; <a id="l5536"></a>Midianites to tempt &amp; invite Israel by their women to <a id="l5537"></a>commit fornication, &amp; to feast with them at the sacrifices <a id="l5538"></a>of their Gods. The Dragon therefore began now to come down <a id="l5539"></a>among the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea.</p>
<p id="par272">The Nicolaitans are also complained of in the <a id="l5540"></a>fourth Epistles, under the name of the Woman Iezabel, <a id="l5541"></a>who calleth herself a Prophetess, &amp; teacheth &amp; seduceth <a id="l5542"></a>the servants of Christ to commit fornication, &amp; to eat <a id="l5543"></a>things sacrificed to Idols. The Woman therefore began <a id="l5544"></a>now to fly into the wilderness.</p>
<p id="par273">The reign of Constantine the great from the time <a id="l5545"></a>of his conquering Licinius, was monarchical over the <a id="l5546"></a>whole Roman Empire. Then the Empire became divided <a id="l5547"></a>between the sons of Constantine. And then it was united <a id="l5548"></a>under Constantius, by his victory over Magnentius. And to <a id="l5549"></a>the affairs of the Church in these three successive periods <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p115r"> &lt;115r&gt; </span> of time, the third fourth &amp; fift Epistles, that is, those to <a id="l5550"></a>the Angels of the Churches in Pergamus, Thyatira, &amp; Sardis, <a id="l5551"></a>seem to relate.  The next Emperor was Iulian the Apostate.</p>
<p id="par274">In the sixth Epistle, that to the Angel of the Church <a id="l5552"></a>in Philadelphia, Christ saith: <sup class="note" id="n266-ref">[266]</sup><em class="underline">Because thou hast kept the <a id="l5553"></a>word of my patience, I will also keep thee from the hour of <a id="l5554"></a>temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try <a id="l5555"></a>them that dwell upon the earth. — Him that overcometh, <a id="l5556"></a>will I make a pillar in the Temple of my God, &amp; he shall <a id="l5557"></a>go no more out; &amp; I will write upon him the name of my <a id="l5558"></a>God</em>, &amp;c. that is, Because in the reign of the heathen Emperor <a id="l5559"></a>Iulian, thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will <a id="l5560"></a>keep thee from the hour of temptation which by the Woman's <a id="l5561"></a>flying into the Wilderness, &amp; the Dragon's making war with <a id="l5562"></a>the remnant of her seed, &amp; the killing of all  who will <a id="l5563"></a>not worship the Image of the Beast, shall come upon all <a id="l5564"></a>the world, to try them that dwell on the earth, and to dis<a id="l5565"></a>tinguish them by sealing the one with the name of God in their <a id="l5566"></a>foreheads, &amp; marking the other with the mark of the Beast.  <a id="l5567"></a><em class="underline">Him that overcometh, I will make a pillar in the Temple of my <a id="l5568"></a>God; &amp; he shall go no more out of it. And I will write upon him the <a id="l5569"></a>name of my God in his forehead</em>. So then the Christians of the <a id="l5570"></a>Church of Philadelphia, as many of them as overcome, are <a id="l5571"></a>sealed with the seal of God, &amp; placed in the second Temple, <a id="l5572"></a>&amp; go no more out.  The same is to be understood of the <a id="l5573"></a>Church in Smyrna, which also kept the word of God's patience, &amp; <a id="l5574"></a>was without fault. These two Churches, with their posterity, <a id="l5575"></a>are therefore the two Pillars, &amp; the two Candlesticks, &amp; the two <a id="l5576"></a>Witnesses in the second Temple.</p>
<p id="par275">XIX After the reign of the Emperor Iulian, &amp; his successor <a id="l5577"></a>Iovian who reigned but five months, the Empire became <a id="l5578"></a>divided again between Valentinian &amp; Valens.  Then the <a id="l5579"></a>Church Catholick, in the Epistle to the Angel of the Church <a id="l5580"></a>of Laodicea, is reprehended as <sup class="note" id="n267-ref">[267]</sup><em class="underline">lukewarm</em>, &amp; threatened to <a id="l5581"></a>be <em class="underline">spewed out of Christ's mouth</em>.

She is <a id="l5585"></a>therefore spewed out of Christ's mouth at the opening of <a id="l5586"></a>the seventh Seal. And this puts an end to the times of <a id="l5587"></a>the first Temple.</p>
<p id="par276">About one half of the Roman Empire turned Christians <a id="l5588"></a>in the reign of Constantine the great &amp; his sons. After <a id="l5589"></a>Iulian had opened the Temples, &amp; restored the worship of <a id="l5590"></a>the heathens, the Emperors Valentinian &amp; Valens tolerated <a id="l5591"></a>it all their reign; &amp; therefore the prophecy of the sixt Seal <a id="l5592"></a>was not fully accomplished before the reign of their suc<a id="l5593"></a>cessor Gratian. It was the custom of the heathen Priests, <a id="l5594"></a>in the beginning of the reign of every sovereign Emperor, <a id="l5595"></a>to offer him the dignity &amp; habit of <em class="underline">Pontifex maximus</em>. <a id="l5596"></a>This dignity all Emperors had hitherto accepted of: but <a id="l5597"></a>Gratian rejected it, threw down the Idols, interdicted the <a id="l5598"></a>sacrifices, &amp; took away the revenues of the sacrifices, &amp; <a id="l5599"></a>salaries &amp; authority of the Priests.   Theodosius the great followed <a id="l5600"></a>his example. And heathenism afterwards recovered itself no <a id="l5601"></a>more, but decreased so fast, that Prudentius, about ten years <a id="l5602"></a>after the death of Theodosius, called the heathens, <em class="underline">vix pauca</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p116r"> &lt;116r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">ingenia &amp; pars hominum rarissima</em>. Whence the affair of the <a id="l5603"></a>sixth seal ended with the reign of Valens, or rather with the beginn<a id="l5604"></a>ing of the reign of <em class="underline">Theodosius</em><sup class="note" id="n268-ref">[268]</sup>, when he rejected the dignity of Pon<a id="l5605"></a>tifex maximus. For the Romans were very much infested by the <a id="l5606"></a>invasions of foreign nations in the reign of Valentinian &amp; Valens,  <a id="l5607"></a> <em class="underline">Hoc tempore</em>, saith Ammianus, <em class="underline">velut per <a id="l5608"></a>universum orbem Romanum bellicum canentibus buccinis, excitæ gentes <a id="l5609"></a>sævissimæ limites sibi proximos p<em class="doubleunderline">es</em>sultabant:<sup class="note" id="n269-ref">[269]</sup> Gallias Rhætiasque simul <a id="l5610"></a>Alemanni populabantur: Sarmatæ Pannonias et Quadi: Picti Saxones <a id="l5611"></a>&amp; Scoti &amp; Attacotti Britannos ærumnis vexavere continuis: Austori<a id="l5612"></a>ani, Mauricæque aliæ gentes Africam solito acriùs incursabant: Thra<a id="l5613"></a>cias diripiebant prædatorij globi Gotthorum: Persarum Rex manus <a id="l5614"></a>Armenijs injectabat</em>. And whilst the Emperors were busy in <a id="l5615"></a>repulsing these enemies, the Hunns &amp; Alans &amp; Goths came over <a id="l5616"></a>the Danube in two bodies, overcame &amp; slew Valens, &amp; made <a id="l5617"></a>so great a slaughter of the Roman Army, that Ammianus <a id="l5618"></a>saith: <em class="underline">nec ulla Annalibus præter Cannensem ita ad inter<a id="l5619"></a>necionem res legitur gesta</em>. But these wars were fully stopt <a id="l5620"></a>on all sides  in the beginning of the reign of Theodosius, <a id="l5621"></a>A.C. 379 &amp; 380.  Thenceforward the Empire remained <a id="l5622"></a>quiet from foreign Armies, till the death of Theodosius <a id="l5623"></a>A.C. 395. So long the four winds were held: &amp; so long <a id="l5624"></a>there was silence in heaven. And the seventh Seal was <a id="l5625"></a>opened when this silence began.</p>
<p id="par277">M<sup>r</sup> Mead hath explained the Prophesy of the first six <a id="l5626"></a>Trumpets not much amiss: If he had observed, that the <a id="l5627"></a>Prophesy of pouring out the Vials of wrath is synchronal <a id="l5628"></a>to that of sounding the Trumpets, his explanation would <a id="l5629"></a>have been more complete.</p>
<p id="par278">The name of <em class="underline">Woes</em> are given to the wars to which the <a id="l5630"></a>three last Trumpets sound, to distinguish them from the <a id="l5631"></a>warrs of the four first.  <a id="l5632"></a>The sacrifices on the first four days of the feast of Tabernacles, <a id="l5633"></a>at which the first four Trumpets sound, &amp; the first four Vials <a id="l5634"></a>of wrath are poured out, are slaughters in four great <a id="l5635"></a>warrs; &amp; these warrs are represented by four winds to the <a id="l5636"></a>four corners of the earth. The first was an east wind, the <a id="l5637"></a>second a west wind, the third a south wind, &amp; the fourth <a id="l5638"></a>a north wind, with respect to the city of Rome, the Metropolis <a id="l5639"></a>of the old Roman Empire. These four plagues fell upon <a id="l5640"></a>the third part of the Earth, Sea, Rivers, Sun, Moon &amp; Stars; <a id="l5641"></a>that is, upon the Earth, Sea, Rivers, Sun, Moon &amp; Stars of <a id="l5642"></a>the third part of the whole scene of these Prophesies of <a id="l5643"></a>Daniel &amp; Iohn.</p>
<p id="par279">The plague of the eastern wind at the sounding of <a id="l5644"></a>the first Trumpet,  was to fall upon the <em class="underline">earth</em>, that is, <a id="l5645"></a>upon the nations of the Greek Empire.  According<a id="l5646"></a>ly, after the death of Theodosius the great, the Goths, <a id="l5647"></a>Sarmatans, Hunns, Isaurians, &amp; A<em class="underline">us</em>torian<sup class="note" id="n270-ref">[270]</sup> Moors invaded <a id="l5648"></a>&amp; miserably wasted Greece, Thrace, Asia minor, Armenia, <a id="l5649"></a>Syria, Egypt, Lybia, &amp; Illyricum, for ten or twelve years <a id="l5650"></a>together.</p>
<p id="par280">That of the western wind at the sounding of the second <a id="l5651"></a>Trumpet, was to fall upon the <em class="underline">Sea</em>, or western Empire, by means <a id="l5652"></a>of a burning mountain cast into it, &amp; turning it to blood. <a id="l5653"></a>Accordingly in the year 407, that Empire began to be <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p117r"> &lt;117r&gt; </span> invaded by the Visigoths, Vandals, Alans, Sueves, Burgundi<a id="l5654"></a>ans, Ostrogoths, Heruli, Quadi, Gepides; &amp; by these wars <a id="l5655"></a>was broken into ten kingdoms, &amp; miserably wasted: &amp; Rome <a id="l5656"></a>(the burning mountain) was besieged &amp; taken by the Ostrogoths, <a id="l5657"></a>in the beginning of these miseries.</p>
<p id="par281">That of the southern wind at the sounding of the third <a id="l5658"></a>Trumpet, was to cause <sup class="note" id="n271-ref">[271]</sup><em class="underline">a great star, burning as it were a lamp, <a id="l5659"></a>to fall from heaven upon the rivers &amp; fountains of waters,</em> [the <a id="l5660"></a>western Empire now divided into many kingdoms] &amp; to turn <a id="l5661"></a>them to <em class="underline">Wormwood</em> &amp; <em class="underline">blood</em>, &amp; make them <em class="underline">bitter</em>.  Accordingly <a id="l5662"></a>Geiseric, the king of the Vandals &amp; Alans in <sup class="note" id="n272-ref">[272]</sup>[Spain, A.C. 427, <a id="l5663"></a>invaded Africa with an army of eighty thousand men; &amp; seating <a id="l5664"></a>himself in Afric invaded the Moors, &amp; made war upon the Romans there, &amp; on the <a id="l5665"></a>sea-coasts of Europe, fifty years together, almost without <a id="l5666"></a>intermission, taking Hippo A.C. 431, &amp; Carthage the capital <a id="l5667"></a>of Africa A.C. 439. And A.C. 455, with a numerous fleet  containing three hundred <a id="l5668"></a>thousand Vandals &amp; Moors, he invaded Italy, took &amp; plun<a id="l5669"></a>dered Rome, Naples, Capua, &amp; many other cities; &amp; carried <a id="l5670"></a>thence the wealth of the cities, &amp; flower of the people, into <a id="l5671"></a>Africa.  The next year (A.C. 456) he rent all Africa from the Empire, expelling the Romans. Then they invaded &amp; took the Islands of the Mediter<a id="l5672"></a>ranean, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Ebusus, Majorca, Minorca, &amp;c <a id="l5673"></a>Then Ricimer besieged the Emperor Anthemius in Rome, <a id="l5674"></a>took the city, &amp; gave his soldiers the plunder, A.C. 472.  The <a id="l5675"></a>Visigoths about the same time ejected the Romans out of <a id="l5676"></a>Spain. And now the western Emperor (the great star <a id="l5677"></a>which fell from heaven, burning as it were a lamp) having <a id="l5678"></a>by all these wars gradually lost almost all his dominions, <a id="l5679"></a>was invaded, &amp; conquered in one year by Odoacer king of <a id="l5680"></a>the Heruli, A.C. 476. After this the Moors revolted A.C. 477, &amp; weakened the Vandals  <a id="l5681"></a>by several warrs  &amp; took Mauritania from them. These warrs continued till the Vandals were invaded &amp; conquered by Belisarius A.C. 534.. And by all these wars <a id="l5683"></a>Africa was almost depopulated,  as Procopius represents who reckons <a id="l5684"></a>that above five millions of men perished in them. When the Vandals first invaded Africa, that country was very populous, <a id="l5685"></a>consisting of about 700 bishopricks, which were more than in all <a id="l5686"></a>France, Spain &amp; Italy together: but by the warrs between the <a id="l5687"></a>Vandals, Romans &amp; Moors, it was depopulated to that degree, that <a id="l5688"></a>after the warr with Belisarius (as Procopius tells us) it was next to a miracle for a traveller to <a id="l5689"></a>see a man.</p>
<p id="par282">In pouring out the third Vial it is said: <sup class="note" id="n273-ref">[273]</sup><em class="underline">Thou art righte<a id="l5690"></a>ous o Lord because thou hast judged thus: For they have <a id="l5691"></a>shed the blood of thy  Saints &amp; Prophets, &amp; thou hast <a id="l5692"></a>given them blood to drink, for they are worthy.</em>  How <a id="l5693"></a>they shed the blood of Saints, may be understood by the <a id="l5694"></a>following Edict of the Emperor Honorius, procured by four Bishops sent to him by a Coun<a id="l5695"></a>cil of African Bishops, who met at Carthage 14 Iune, A.C. 410.</p>

Rome her self was taken &amp; retaken severall <a id="l5744"></a>times, &amp; thereby her people were thinned; her old government <a id="l5745"></a>by a Senate ceased, her nobles were ruined, &amp; all her glory <a id="l5746"></a>was extinct: &amp; A.C. 552, after a war of seventeen years, <a id="l5747"></a>the kingdom of the Ostrogoths fell, whose kings had been her <a id="l5748"></a>husband &amp; her <em class="underline">Sun</em><sup class="note" id="n275-ref">[275]</sup>. Yet the remainder of the Ostrogoths <a id="l5749"></a>&amp; an army of Germans called in to their assistance, continued <a id="l5750"></a>the war three or four years longer.  Then ensued a war <a id="l5751"></a>of the Heruli, who, as Anastasius tells us, <em class="underline">perimebant cunctam</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p119r"> &lt;119r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">Italiam, slew all Italy</em>. And this was followed by a war of the <a id="l5752"></a>Lombards, the fiercest of all the Barbarians. This war began <a id="l5753"></a>A.C. 568, &amp; lasted 38 years together; <em class="underline">facta tali clade</em>, saith <a id="l5754"></a> Anastasius, <em class="underline">qualem a sæculo nullus meminit</em>. It ended in <a id="l5755"></a>the Papacy of Sabinian A.C. 605, by a lasting peace then <a id="l5756"></a>made with the Lombards.  Three years before it ended, <a id="l5757"></a>Gregory the great,  then Bishop of Rome thus mentions it: <em class="underline">Qualiter <a id="l5758"></a>enim et quotidianis gladijs &amp; quantis Longobardorum incur<a id="l5759"></a>sionibus, ecce jam per triginta quinque annorum longitu<a id="l5760"></a>dinem premimur, nullis explere vocibus suggestionis valemus</em>. And in <a id="l5761"></a>one of his sermons to the people, he thus expresses the great <a id="l5762"></a>consumption of the  Romans by these warrs: <a id="l5763"></a><em class="underline">Ex illa plebe innumerabili quanti remanseritis aspicitis, et <a id="l5764"></a>tamen adhuc quotidiè flagellæ urgent, repentini casus oppri<a id="l5765"></a>munt, novæ res &amp; improvisæ clades affligunt</em>.  In another Sermon <a id="l5766"></a>he thus describes the desolations: <em class="underline">Destructæ urbes, eversa sunt <a id="l5767"></a>castra, depopulati agri, in solitudinem terra redacta <a id="l5768"></a>est. Nullus in agris incola, penè nullus in urbibus habitator <a id="l5769"></a>remansit. Et tamen ipsæ parvæ generis humani reliquiæ <a id="l5770"></a>adhuc quotidiè et sine cessatione feriuntur, et finem non <a id="l5771"></a>habent flagella cœlestis justitiæ. Ipsa autem quæ aliquan<a id="l5772"></a>do mundi Domina esse videbatur, qualis remansit Roma <a id="l5773"></a>conspicimus innumeris doloribus multipliciter attrita, deso<a id="l5774"></a>latione civium, impressione hostium, frequentiâ ruinarum.</em> <a id="l5775"></a>— <em class="underline">Ecce  jam de illa omnes hujus <a id="l5776"></a>sæculi potentes ablati sunt.</em> — <em class="underline">Ecce populi defecerunt.</em> <a id="l5777"></a>— <em class="underline">Vbi enim Senatus? Vbi jam populus? Contabuerunt <a id="l5778"></a>ossa, consumptæ sunt carnes. Omnis enim sæcularium <a id="l5779"></a>dignitatum ordo extinctus est, et tamen ipsos nos paucos qui <a id="l5780"></a>remansimus, adhuc quotidiè gladij, adhuc quotidiè inn umeræ tribulationes premunt</em>. — <em class="underline">Vacua jam ardet Roma. Quid <a id="l5781"></a>autem ista de hominibus dicimus? Cum ruinis crebrescenti<a id="l5782"></a>bus ipsa quoque destrui ædificia videmus. Postquam defecerunt <a id="l5783"></a>homines etiam parietes cadunt. Iam ecce desolata, ecce <a id="l5784"></a>contrita, ecce gemitibus oppressa est.</em> &amp;c. All this was spoken <a id="l5785"></a>by Gregory to the people of Rome, who were witnesses of the truth of it. <a id="l5786"></a>And thus by the plagues of the four winds, the Empire of the <a id="l5787"></a>Greeks was shaken, &amp; the Empire of the Latines fell; and <a id="l5788"></a>Rome remained nothing more than the capital of a poor <a id="l5789"></a>dukedome, subordinate to Ravenna, the seat of the Exarchs.</p>
<p id="par290">XXXI The fifth Trumpet sounded to the warrs, which the king <a id="l5790"></a>of the south (as he is called by Daniel) made in the time of the <a id="l5791"></a>end, in pushing at the king who did according to his will. This <a id="l5792"></a>plague began with the opening of the bottomless pit, which <a id="l5793"></a>denotes the letting out of a false religion; the smoke which came <a id="l5794"></a>out of the pit,  signifying the multitude which embra<a id="l5795"></a>ced that religion; &amp; the Locusts which came out of the smoke, <a id="l5796"></a>the armies which came out of that multitude. This pit was <a id="l5797"></a>opened, to let out smoke &amp; locusts into the regions of the four <a id="l5798"></a>monarchies, or some of them.  The king of these locusts was <a id="l5799"></a>the Angel of the bottomless pit, or chief governour as well in <a id="l5800"></a>religious as civil affairs, such as was the Calif of the Saracens. <a id="l5801"></a>Swarms of Locusts arise in Arabia fælix, &amp; from thence infest <a id="l5802"></a>the neighbouring nations: &amp; so are a very fit type of the numerous <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p120r"> &lt;120r&gt; </span> armies of Arabians invading the Romans. They began to invade <a id="l5803"></a>the Romans A.C. 634; &amp; to reign at Damascus A.C. 637.  they <a id="l5804"></a>built Bagdat A.C. 766, &amp; reigned over Persia, Syria, Arabia, <a id="l5805"></a>Egypt, Africa &amp; Spain. They lost Africa to Mahades, A.C. 910; <a id="l5806"></a>Media,  Hircania, Chorasan, &amp; all Persia to the Dailamites, <a id="l5807"></a>between the years 927 &amp; 935; Mesopotamia &amp; Miafarekin <a id="l5808"></a>to Nasiruddaulas, A.C. 930; Syria &amp; Egypt to Achsijd, A.C. <a id="l5809"></a>935. And now being in great distress, the Calif of Bagdat, <a id="l5810"></a>A.C. 936, surrendred all the rest of <sup class="note" id="n276-ref">[276]</sup>[his temporal power to <a id="l5811"></a>Mahomet the son of Rajici, King of Wasit in Chaldea, &amp; made <a id="l5812"></a>him Emperor of Emperors. But Mahomet within two years <a id="l5813"></a>lost Bagdat to the Turks; &amp; thenceforward Bagdat was <a id="l5814"></a>sometimes in the hands of the Turks, &amp; sometimes in the hands <a id="l5815"></a>of the Saracens, till Togrulbec (called also Togra, Dogrissa, <a id="l5816"></a>Tangrolipix, &amp; Sadoc) conquered Chorasan &amp; Persia; &amp; A.C. <a id="l5817"></a>1055, added Bagdat to his empire, making it the seat thereof. <a id="l5818"></a>His successors, Olub-Arslan &amp; Melechschah, conquered the regions <a id="l5819"></a>upon Euphrates; &amp; these conquests, after the death of Melec<a id="l5820"></a>sah, brake into the kingdoms of Armenia, Mesopotamia, <a id="l5821"></a>Syria, &amp; Cappadocia. The whole time that the Califs of the <a id="l5822"></a>Saracens reigned  with a temporal dominion at Damascus <a id="l5823"></a>&amp; Bagdat together, was 300 years viz<sup>t</sup> from the year 637 <a id="l5824"></a>to the year 936 inclusively. Now Locusts live but five months; <a id="l5825"></a>&amp; therefore, for the decorum of the type, these Locusts are <a id="l5826"></a>said to hurt men five months &amp; five months, as if they had <a id="l5827"></a>lived about five months at Damascus, &amp; again about five months at <a id="l5828"></a>Bagdat, in all ten months, or 300 prophetic days, which are years</p>
<p id="par291">The sixth Trumpet sounded to the wars, which Daniel's king <a id="l5829"></a>of the north made against the king above-mentioned, who did <a id="l5830"></a>according to his will. In these warrs the king of the north, according <a id="l5831"></a>to Daniel, conquered the Empire of the Greeks, &amp; also Iudea, Egypt, <a id="l5832"></a>Lybia, &amp; Ethiopia: &amp; by these conquests the Empire of the Turks <a id="l5833"></a>was set up, as you may know by the extent thereof. These wars <a id="l5834"></a>commenced A.C. 1258, when the four kingdoms of the Turks <a id="l5835"></a>seated  upon <a id="l5836"></a>Euphrates, that of Armenia major seated at Miyapharekin, <a id="l5837"></a>Megarkin or Martyropolis, that of Mesopotamia seated at <a id="l5838"></a>Mosul, that of all Syria seated at Aleppo, &amp; that of Cappadocia <a id="l5839"></a>seated at Iconium, were invaded by the Tartars under Hulacu, <a id="l5840"></a>&amp; driven into the western parts of Asia minor, where they made <a id="l5841"></a>war upon the Greeks, &amp; began to erect the present Empire of the <a id="l5842"></a>Turks.  <a id="l5843"></a>Vpon the sounding of the sixth Trumpet, Iohn <sup class="note" id="n277-ref">[277]</sup><em class="underline">heard a voice from <a id="l5844"></a>the four horns of the golden Altar which is before God, saying <a id="l5845"></a>to the Angel which had the Trumpet, Loose the four Angels <a id="l5846"></a>which are bound at the great river Euphrates. And the four Angels <a id="l5847"></a>were loosed, which were prepared for an hour &amp; a day, &amp; a <a id="l5848"></a>month &amp; a year, for to slay the third part of men</em>. By the <a id="l5849"></a>four horns of the golden Altar, is signified the situation of the <a id="l5850"></a>head cities of the said four kingdoms, Miafarekin, Mosul, Aleppo, <a id="l5851"></a>&amp; Iconium, which were in a quadrangle. They slew the third <a id="l5852"></a>part of men, when they conquered the Greek Empire, &amp; took <a id="l5853"></a>Constantinople, A.C. 1453. And they began to be prepared for <a id="l5854"></a>this purpose, when Olub-Arslan began to conquer the nations <a id="l5855"></a>upon Euphrates, A.C. 1063.  The interval is called an hour &amp; a <a id="l5856"></a>day, &amp; a month &amp; a year, or 391 prophetic days, which are years. In <a id="l5857"></a>the first thirty years Olub Arslan &amp; Melecsah conquered the nations <a id="l5858"></a>upon Euphrates, &amp; reigned over the whole. Melecsah died A.C. 1092, <a id="l5859"></a>&amp; was succeeded by a little child; &amp; then this kingdom brake into <a id="l5860"></a>the four kingdoms above mentioned.</p>

For the High-<a id="l5870"></a>Priest, in the feast of the seventh month in the seventh year, went into the most <a id="l5871"></a>holy place, &amp; took the book of the law out of the right side of the Ark to read <a id="l5872"></a>it to the people. And in order to read it well, he studied it seven days, that is, <a id="l5873"></a>upon the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>t</sup>, 6<sup>t</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> &amp; 10<sup>th</sup> days,  being attended by <a id="l5874"></a>some of the  priests to hear him perform. And these seven days are alluded <a id="l5875"></a>to, by the Lamb's opening the seven seales successively.</p>
<p id="par294">Vpon the  tenth day of the month, a young bullock was offered for a <a id="l5876"></a>sin-offering for the High Priest, &amp; a Goat for a sin-offering for the people: &amp; lots <a id="l5877"></a>were cast upon two Goats to determin which of them should be God's lot for the <a id="l5878"></a>sin-offering; &amp; the other Goat was called <em class="underline">Azazel</em>, the scape-goat.  The High <a id="l5879"></a>Priest in his linen garments, took a censer full of burning coales of <a id="l5880"></a>fire from the altar, &amp; his hands full of sweet incense beaten small; &amp; went <a id="l5881"></a>into the most holy place within the veil, &amp; put the incense upon the fire, <a id="l5882"></a>&amp; sprinkled the blood of the bullock with his finger upon the mercy-seat &amp; <a id="l5883"></a>before the mercy-seat seven times: &amp; then killed the Goat which fell to God's <a id="l5884"></a>lot, for a sin-offering for the people, &amp; brought his blood within the v<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>il, &amp; <a id="l5885"></a>sprinkled it also seven times upon the mercy-seat &amp; before the mercy <a id="l5886"></a>seat.  Then he went out to the altar, &amp; sprinkled it also seven times <a id="l5887"></a>with the blood of the bullock, &amp; as often with the blood of the goat.  After <a id="l5888"></a>this <em class="underline">he laid both his hands upon the head of the  live goat, &amp; confessed over <a id="l5889"></a>him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, &amp; all their transgressions <a id="l5890"></a>in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the Goat; &amp; by the hands of a fit man into the wilderness: &amp; the Goat  bore upon him <a id="l5892"></a>all their iniquities into a land not inhabited. Levit</em> ch. IV &amp; ch. XVI.  <a id="l5893"></a>While the High-Priest was doing these things in the most holy place &amp; at <a id="l5894"></a>the Altar, the people continued at their devotion quietly &amp; in silence. <a id="l5895"></a>Then the High Priest went into the holy place,  put off his linen garments, <a id="l5896"></a>&amp; put on other garments;  then came out, &amp; sent the bullock &amp; the goat of the <a id="l5897"></a>sin-offering to be burnt without the camp, with fire taken in a censer <a id="l5898"></a>from the Altar. And as the people returned home from the Temple, they <a id="l5899"></a>said to one another, <em class="underline">God seale you to a good new year.</em></p>
<p id="par295"> In allusion to all this, <em class="underline"> when he had opened the seventh seal, there was <a id="l5900"></a>silence in heaven about the space of half an  hour. And an Angel <a id="l5901"></a>stood at the Altar having a golden Censer, &amp; there was given unto him much <a id="l5902"></a>incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints, upon the golden <a id="l5903"></a>altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense with the <a id="l5904"></a>prayers of the saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hand. And the <a id="l5905"></a>Angel took the Censer, &amp; filled it with fire of the Altar, &amp; cast it to the earth,</em> suppose without the camp, for sacrificing the Goat which fell to God's lot. For <a id="l5906"></a>the High-Priest being Christ himself, the bullock is omitted.  At this sacrifice <a id="l5907"></a><em class="underline">there were voices &amp; thunderings</em>, suppose of the musick of the Temple, <em class="underline">&amp; light<a id="l5908"></a>nings</em> of the sacred fire, <em class="underline">&amp; an earthquake</em>. And synchronal to these things <a id="l5909"></a>was the sealing of the <em class="underline">144000 out of all the twelve tribes of the children of</em> Israel with <a id="l5910"></a>the seal of God in their foreheads, while the rest of the twelve tribes <a id="l5911"></a>received the mark of the Beast, &amp; the Woman fled from the temple into <a id="l5912"></a>the wilderness to her place upon this Beast. For this sealing &amp; marking is <a id="l5913"></a>represented by casting lots upon the two goats, sacrificing God's lot on mount <a id="l5914"></a>Sion, &amp; sending the scape-goat into the wilderness loaden with the sins of the people.</p>
<p id="par296">Vpon the fifteenth day of the month, &amp; the six following days, there were <a id="l5915"></a>very great sacrifices. And in allusion to the sounding of trumpets, &amp; singing with <a id="l5916"></a>thundring voices, &amp; pouring out drink-offerings at those sacrifices, seven <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p122r"> &lt;122r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">Trumpets are sounded</em>, &amp; <em class="underline">seven thunders utter their voices,</em> &amp; <em class="underline">seven Vialls <a id="l5917"></a>of wrath are poured out</em>. And therefore the sounding of the seven trumpets, the <a id="l5918"></a>voices of the seven thunders, &amp; the pouring out  of the seven vialls of wrath, are <a id="l5919"></a>synchronal, &amp; relate to one &amp; the same division of  the time of the seventh <a id="l5920"></a>seale following the silence, into seven successive parts. The seven days of <a id="l5921"></a>this feast <sup class="note" id="n279-ref">[279]</sup>[were called the feast of Tabernacles. And during these seven <a id="l5922"></a>days the children of Israel dwelt in booths, &amp; rejoyced with palm-branches <a id="l5923"></a>in their hands.  To this alludes  <em class="underline">the multitude with palms in their hands</em>, <a id="l5924"></a>which appeared after the sealing of the 144000, &amp; <em class="underline">came out of the great tri<a id="l5925"></a>bulation</em> with triumph at the battel of the great day,  to which the seventh <a id="l5926"></a>trumpet sounds. The visions therefore of the 1<em class="underline">44</em>000, &amp; of the pa<em class="underline">lm-b</em>ear<a id="l5927"></a>ing multitude, extend to the sounding of the seventh trumpet, &amp; therefore <a id="l5928"></a>are synchronal to the times of the seventh seale.</p>
<p id="par297">When the <em class="underline">14400 are sealed out of all the twelve tribes of Israel</em>, <a id="l5929"></a>&amp; the rest receive the mark of the Beast, &amp; thereby the first temple <a id="l5930"></a>is destroyed; Iohn is bidden to <em class="underline">measure the temple &amp; altar</em>, that is, <a id="l5931"></a>their courts, <em class="underline">&amp; them that worship therein</em>, that is, the 144000 standing <a id="l5932"></a>on mount <em class="underline">Sion</em> &amp; on the sea of glass: <em class="underline">but the court that is without <a id="l5933"></a>the temple</em>, that is, the peoples court, to <em class="underline">leave out &amp; measure it <a id="l5934"></a>not, because it is given to the gentiles,</em> those  who receive the mark <a id="l5935"></a>of the Beast; <em class="underline">&amp; the holy city they shall tread under foot forty &amp; two <a id="l5936"></a>months</em>, that is, all the time that the Beast acts under the woman <em class="underline">Baby<a id="l5937"></a>lon</em>, And <em class="underline">the two witnesses prophesy 1260 days</em>, that is, all the same time, <a id="l5938"></a><em class="underline">clothed in sackcloth</em>. <em class="underline">These have power,</em> like Elijah, <em class="underline">to shut heaven <a id="l5939"></a>that it rain not</em>, at the sounding of the first trumpet; &amp;, like Moses, <em class="underline">to turn <a id="l5940"></a>the waters into blood</em> at the sounding of the second; <em class="underline">&amp; to smite the earth <a id="l5941"></a>with all plagues</em>, those of the Trumpets, <em class="underline">as often as they will</em>. These <a id="l5942"></a>prophesied at the building of the second temple, like <em class="underline">Haggai</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Zechary.</em> <a id="l5943"></a>These are <em class="underline">the two Olive-trees</em>, or churches, which supplied the lamps, with <a id="l5944"></a>oil, Zech. IV. These are <em class="underline">the two candlesticks</em>, or churches, standing be<a id="l5945"></a>fore the God of the earth. Five of the seven churches of Asia, those <a id="l5946"></a>in prosperity, are found fault with, &amp; exhorted to repent, &amp; threatned <a id="l5947"></a>to be <em class="underline">removed out of their places</em>, or <em class="underline">spewed out of</em> Christ's <em class="underline">mouth, <a id="l5948"></a>or punished with the sword of</em> Christ's <em class="underline">mouth</em>, <em class="underline">except they repent</em>: the <a id="l5949"></a>other two the Churches of <em class="underline">Smyrna</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Philadelphia</em>, which were under <a id="l5950"></a>persecution, remain in a state of persecution, to illuminate the <a id="l5951"></a>second temple. When the primitive Church catholick, represented <a id="l5952"></a>by <em class="underline">the woman in heaven</em>, apostatized, &amp; became divided into two cor<a id="l5953"></a>rupt churches, represented by the <em class="underline">whore of Babylon</em> &amp; the <em class="underline">two-horn<a id="l5954"></a>ed Beast</em>, the <em class="underline">144000 who were sealed out of all the twelve tribes</em>, <a id="l5955"></a>became the <em class="underline">two witnesses</em>, in opposition to those two false churches. <a id="l5956"></a>And the name of <em class="underline">two witnesses</em> once imposed, remains to the true Church <a id="l5957"></a>of God in all times &amp; places to the end of the prophecy.</p>
<p id="par298">In the interpretation of this prophecy, <em class="underline">the woman in heaven <a id="l5958"></a>clothed with the sun</em>, before she flies into the wilderness, represents <a id="l5959"></a>the primitive church catholick, illuminated with the seven lamps in <a id="l5960"></a>the seven golden candlesticks, which are the <em class="underline">seven churches</em> of <em class="underline">Asia</em>. <a id="l5961"></a>And <em class="underline">the Dragon</em> signifies the same empire with <em class="underline">Daniel's</em> He-goat in the <a id="l5962"></a>reign of his last horn, that is, the whole <em class="underline">Roman</em> empire, until it became <a id="l5963"></a>divided into the <em class="underline">Greek</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Latin</em> Empires; &amp; all the time of that division it <a id="l5964"></a>signifies the <em class="underline">Greek</em> empire alone: And <em class="underline">the Beast</em> is Daniel's fourth Beast, <a id="l5965"></a>that is, the empire of the <em class="underline">Latins</em>. Before the division of the Roman Empire <a id="l5966"></a>into the <em class="underline">Greek</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Latin</em> Empires, the Beast is included in the body of the <a id="l5967"></a>Dragon; &amp; from the time of that division, the Beast is the <em class="underline">Latin</em> Empire alone. <a id="l5968"></a> Hence the Dragon &amp; Beast have the same heads &amp; horns; but the <a id="l5969"></a>heads are crowned upon the Dragon, &amp; the horns upon the beast. The <a id="l5970"></a>horns are ten kingdoms, into which the Beast becomes divided presently <a id="l5971"></a>after his separation from the Dragon, as hath been described above. The <a id="l5972"></a>heads are seven successive Dynasties, or parts, into which the Roman <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p123r"> &lt;123r&gt; </span> Empire becomes divided by the opening of the seven seales. Before the <a id="l5973"></a>woman fled into the wilderness, <em class="underline">she being with child</em> of a christian <a id="l5974"></a>Empire, <em class="underline">cried travelling</em>, (viz<sup>t</sup> in the ten years persecution of Dioclesian) <a id="l5975"></a><em class="underline">&amp; pained to be delivered</em>. <em class="underline">And the Dragon</em>, the heathen Roman Empire, <a id="l5976"></a><em class="underline">brought forth a man child, who</em> at length <em class="underline">was to rule all nations with <a id="l5977"></a>a rod of iron. And her child was caught up to God, &amp; to his throne</em> in <a id="l5978"></a>the temple, by the victory of Constantine the great over Maxentius; <a id="l5979"></a><em class="underline">&amp; the woman fled</em> from the temple <em class="underline">into the wilderness</em> of Arabia <a id="l5980"></a>to Babylon, <em class="underline">where she hath a place</em> of riches &amp; honour &amp; dominion, <a id="l5981"></a>upon the back of the Beast, <em class="underline">prepared of God, that they should feed <a id="l5982"></a>her there 1260 days</em>. <em class="underline">And there was war in heaven</em>, (between the <a id="l5983"></a>heathens under Maximinus &amp; the new Christian empire); <em class="underline">&amp; the Dra<a id="l5984"></a>gon was cast out, that old serpent, which deceiveth the whole world</em>, <a id="l5985"></a>the spirit of the heathen idolatry; <em class="underline">he was cast out</em> of the throne <em class="underline">to the <a id="l5986"></a>earth. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, &amp; by the word <a id="l5987"></a>of their testimony. And they loved not their lives unto the death</em>.</p>
<p id="par299"><em class="underline">And when the Dragon saw that he was cast down, he persecuted the <a id="l5988"></a>woman which brought forth the man-child</em>, stirring up a new persecution <a id="l5989"></a>against her in the reign of Licinius. <em class="underline">And to the woman</em>, by the building <a id="l5990"></a>of Constantinople &amp; equalling it to Rome, <em class="underline">were given two wings of a <a id="l5991"></a>great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place</em> upon <a id="l5992"></a>the back of her beast, <em class="underline">where she is nourished a time times &amp; half a time, <a id="l5993"></a>from the face of the serpent</em>. <em class="underline">And the serpent</em>, (upon the death of Con<a id="l5994"></a>stantine the great,) <em class="underline">cast out waters as a flood</em>, (viz<sup>t</sup> the western <a id="l5995"></a>empires under Constantine junior &amp; Constans) <em class="underline">after the woman, that <a id="l5996"></a>he might cause her to be carried away of the flood</em>. <em class="underline">And the earth</em> (the <a id="l5997"></a>nations of Asia now under Constantinople) <em class="underline">helped the woman;</em> &amp; by con<a id="l5998"></a>quering the western empire, now under Magnentius, <em class="underline">swallowed up <a id="l5999"></a>the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth. And the Dragon was <a id="l6000"></a>wroth with the woman, &amp; went to make war with the remnant of <a id="l6001"></a>her seed, which kept the commandments of God, &amp; had the testimony <a id="l6002"></a>of Iesus</em>, &amp; which in that war were sealed out of all the twelve <a id="l6003"></a>tribes of Israel, &amp; remained upon mount Sion with the Lamb, being <a id="l6004"></a>in number 144000, &amp; having their fathers name written in their <a id="l6005"></a>foreheads.</p>
<p id="par300">And when the earth had swallowed up the flood, &amp; the Dragon <a id="l6006"></a>was gone to make war with the remnant of the woman's seed, Iohn <a id="l6007"></a><em class="underline">stood upon the sand of the sea, &amp; saw the Beast with seven heads &amp; <a id="l6008"></a>ten horns rise out of the sea</em>. <em class="underline">And the Beast was like unto a <a id="l6009"></a>Leopard, &amp; his feet as the feet of a Bear, &amp; his mouth as the mouth <a id="l6010"></a>of a Lyon</em>. Iohn here names Daniel's four Beast in order, putting <a id="l6011"></a>his Beast in the room of Daniel's fourth Beast, to shew that they are <a id="l6012"></a>the same. <em class="underline">And the Dragon gave this Beast his throne, &amp; power &amp; great <a id="l6013"></a>authority</em>, by relinquishing the western empire to him. <em class="underline">And one of <a id="l6014"></a>his heads</em> (the sixth) <em class="underline">was  as it were wounded to death,</em> viz. By the <a id="l6015"></a>sword of the earth, which swallowed up the waters cast out of the mouth of <a id="l6016"></a>the Dragon; <em class="underline">&amp; his deadly wound was healed</em>. It was healed by a new di<a id="l6017"></a>vision of the empire between Valentinian &amp; Valens, An.  364. Iohn saw <a id="l6018"></a>the Beast rise out of the sea, at the division thereof between Gratian &amp; Theo<a id="l6019"></a>dosius A.  379. And the Dragon gave the Beast his power, &amp; his throne &amp; <a id="l6020"></a>great authority, at the death of Theodosius, when Theodosius gave the western <a id="l6021"></a>empire to his son Honorius. After which the two empires were no more <a id="l6022"></a>united: But the western Empire became presently divided into ten kingdomes, <a id="l6023"></a>as above; &amp; these kingdoms at length unitd in religion under the woman, &amp; <a id="l6024"></a>reign with her forty &amp; two months.</p>
<p id="par301"><em class="underline">And I beheld</em>, saith Iohn, <em class="underline">another beast coming out of the earth</em>. <a id="l6025"></a>When the woman fled from the Dragon into the kingdom of the Beast, &amp; became <a id="l6026"></a>his church, this other Beast rose up out of the earth, to represent the Church <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p124r"> &lt;124r&gt; </span> of the Dragon. For <em class="underline">he had two horns like the Lamb</em>, (such as were the <a id="l6027"></a>Bishopricks of Alexandra &amp; Antioch;) <em class="underline">&amp; he spake as the Dragon</em> in <a id="l6028"></a>matters of religion. <em class="underline">And he causeth the earth</em>, or nations of the <a id="l6029"></a>Dragon's kingdom, <em class="underline">to worship the first Beast, whose deadly wound was <a id="l6030"></a>healed</em>, that is, to be of his religion. <em class="underline">And he doth great wonders, so that <a id="l6031"></a>he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men</em>; <a id="l6032"></a>that is, he excommunicateth those who differ from him in point of religion. <a id="l6033"></a>For in pronouncing their excommunications they used to swing down <a id="l6034"></a>a lighted torch from above. <em class="underline">And he said to them that dwell on the earth, <a id="l6035"></a>that they should make an image to the Beast, which had the wound <a id="l6036"></a>by a sword &amp; did live</em>, that is, that they should call a Council of <a id="l6037"></a>men of the religion of this Beast. <em class="underline">And he had power to give life <a id="l6038"></a>to the image, that the image should both speak, &amp; cause that as many <a id="l6039"></a>as would not worship the Image of the Beast should be killed,</em> viz<sup>t</sup> <a id="l6040"></a>mystically, by dissolving their churches. <em class="underline">And he causeth all both small <a id="l6041"></a>&amp; great, rich &amp; poor, bond &amp; free, to receive a mark in their right <a id="l6042"></a>hands or in their foreheads, that no man might buy or sell save he <a id="l6043"></a>that had the mark  or the name of Beast, or the number of his <a id="l6044"></a>name</em>, that is, the mark ✝, or the name ΛΑΤΕΙΝΟΣ, or the number thereof <a id="l6045"></a>Χξ<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>5<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>, 666. All others were excommunicated.</p>
<p id="par302">When the seven Angels had poured out the seven Vials of wrath, <a id="l6046"></a>&amp; Iohn had discovered them all in the present time, he is called up from <a id="l6047"></a>the time of the seventh Vial to the time of the sixt seal, to take a view <a id="l6048"></a>of the woman &amp; her Beast, who were to reign in the times of the seventh <a id="l6049"></a>seale. And in respect of the latter part of time of the sixth seal, then con<a id="l6050"></a>sidered as present, the Angel tells Iohn: <em class="underline">The Beast that thou sawest, was <a id="l6051"></a>&amp; is not, &amp; shall ascend out of the Abyss, &amp; go into perdition</em>; That is,  <a id="l6052"></a>He was in the reign of Constans &amp; Magnentius, untill Constantius con<a id="l6053"></a>quered Magnentius, &amp; reunited the western empire to the eastern. He is <a id="l6054"></a>not during the re-union, &amp; he shall ascend out of the abyss or sea at a <a id="l6055"></a>following division of the empire. The Angel tells him further: <em class="underline">Here <a id="l6056"></a>is the mind which hath wisdome: The seven heads are seven mountains, on <a id="l6057"></a>which the woman sitteth</em>; Rome being built upon seven hills, &amp; thence <a id="l6058"></a>called the seven-hilled city. <em class="underline">Also they are seven <sup class="note" id="n280-ref">[280]</sup>[kings: five are fallen, <a id="l6059"></a>&amp; one is, &amp; another is not come; &amp; when he cometh, he must continue a <a id="l6060"></a>short space: &amp; the Beast that was &amp; is not, even he is the eighth, &amp; is of the <a id="l6061"></a>seven, &amp; goeth into perdition</em>. Five are fallen, the times of the first five <a id="l6062"></a>seales being past; &amp; one is, the time of the sixth seal being considered <a id="l6063"></a>as present; &amp; another is not yet come, &amp; when he cometh, which will be <a id="l6064"></a>at the opening of the seventh seal, he must continue a short space: and <a id="l6065"></a>the beast that was &amp; is not, even his is the eighth, viz<sup>t</sup>. by means of the division of the <a id="l6066"></a>Roman Empire into two collateral Empires; &amp; is of the seven, being one half <a id="l6067"></a>of the seventh, &amp; shall go into perdition. The words, <em class="underline">Five are fallen &amp; one <a id="l6068"></a>is &amp; another is not yet come</em>, are usually referred by interpreters to the time of Iohn the <a id="l6069"></a>Apostel, when the prophecy was given. But it is to be considered, that in <a id="l6070"></a>this prophesy many things are spoken of as present, which were not <a id="l6071"></a>present when the prophecy was given, but which were present with respect <a id="l6072"></a>to some future time, considered as present in the visions, So where it's <a id="l6073"></a>said upon pouring out the seventh Vial of wrath, that <em class="underline">great Babylon receiv<a id="l6074"></a>ed the cup of the wine of the fierceness of God's wrath;</em> this relates not to the <a id="l6075"></a>time of Iohn the Apostel, but to  the time of pouring out the seventh <a id="l6076"></a>vial of wrath. And so where it's said, <em class="underline">Babylon is fallen, is fallen</em>; &amp; <em class="underline">thrust in <a id="l6077"></a>thy sickle &amp; reap, for the time is come for thee to reap; and the time of the <a id="l6078"></a>dead is come, that they should be judged</em>; and <em class="underline">I saw the dead small &amp; great stand <a id="l6079"></a>before God</em>: these sayings relate not to the days of Iohn the Apostel, but to <a id="l6080"></a>the latter times considered as present in the visions. And so the words, <em class="underline">five <a id="l6081"></a>are fallen, &amp; one is &amp; another is not yet come</em>, &amp; <em class="underline">the Beast that was &amp; is not <a id="l6082"></a>he is the eighth,</em> are not to be referred to the age of Iohn the Apostle, but <a id="l6083"></a>relate to the time when the Beast was wounded to death with a sword, &amp; shew <a id="l6084"></a>that this wound was given him in his sixth head. And without the reference <a id="l6085"></a>we are not told in what head the Beast was wounded. <em class="underline">And the ten horns <a id="l6086"></a>which thou sawest, are ten kings which have received no kingdome as yet, but re<a id="l6087"></a>ceive power as kings the same hour with the Beast</em>. These have one <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p125r"> &lt;125r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">mind</em>, being of the whore's religion, <em class="underline">&amp; shall give their power &amp; strength <a id="l6088"></a>unto the Beast</em>. <em class="underline">These shall make war with the Lamb</em>, at the sounding of <a id="l6089"></a>the seventh trumpet; <em class="underline">&amp; the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of <a id="l6090"></a>lords &amp; King of Kings; &amp; they that are with him are called &amp; chosen &amp; faith<a id="l6091"></a>full</em>. <em class="underline">And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest where the <a id="l6092"></a>whore sitteth, are peoples &amp; multitudes &amp; nations &amp; tongues</em>, composing <a id="l6093"></a>her Beast. <em class="underline">And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the Beast, these shall <a id="l6094"></a>hate the whore, &amp; shall make her desolate &amp; naked, &amp; shall eat her flesh, <a id="l6095"></a>&amp; burn her with fire</em>, at the end of the 1260 days. <em class="underline">For God shall put <a id="l6096"></a>in their hearts to fulfill his will, &amp; to agree &amp; give their kingdom to <a id="l6097"></a>the Beast, untill the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman which <a id="l6098"></a>thou sawest, is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth,</em> <a id="l6099"></a>or the great city of the Latines, which reigneth over the ten kings till the end <a id="l6100"></a>of those days.</p>

This year seems to be <a id="l2406"></a>used by Moses in his history of the flood, &amp; by Iohn in the Apocalyps, where a time times &amp; half a time, 42 months <a id="l2407"></a>&amp; 1260 days, are put equipollent. But in  recconing by many of there <a id="l2408"></a>years together, an account is to be kept of the odd days which were added <a id="l2409"></a>to the end of these years. For the Egyptians  added five days to the <a id="l2410"></a>end of this year;  &amp; so did the Chaldeans long before the  times of Daniel, as appears by the æra of Nabonassar: <a id="l2412"></a> &amp; the Persian Magi  used the same year of 365 days, till the empire of the Arabians. The ancient Greeks also  used <a id="l2413"></a> the same solar year of 12 equal months, or  360 days; but every <a id="l2414"></a>other year added an intercalary month, consisting  of  10 &amp; 11 days alternately. <a id="l2415"></a></p>
<p id="par150">The year of the Iews, even from their coming out of Egypt, was Lunisolar. It was solar, <a id="l2417"></a>for the   harvest always followed the Passover &amp; the fruits of the land were always gathered before the <a id="l2418"></a>feast of Tabernacles, . Levit 23.  But the months  were lunar, <a id="l2420"></a>For the people were commanded by Moses  in the beginning of every <a id="l2421"></a>month to blow with Trumpets, &amp; offer burnt offerings  with their drink offerings, Num. 10.10. &amp; 28.<a id="l2422"></a>11, 14 &amp;  this solemnity was kept on the new moons  <em class="underline">Psal. 81.3, 4, 5.</em>  <em class="underline">1. Chron 23.31</em>. These months were <a id="l2424"></a>called by Moses the first, 2<sup>d</sup>, 3<sup>d</sup> 4<sup>th</sup> month &amp;c. And the first month  was also <a id="l2425"></a>called Abib, the second  Zif, the seventh Ethanim, the eighth Bull, Exod. 13.4. <a id="l2426"></a>1 King 6.37, 38 &amp; 8.2. But in the Babylonian captivity the Iews used the <a id="l2427"></a>names of the  Chaldean months, &amp; by those names understood the months <a id="l2428"></a>of their own year; so that the Iewish months lost their old names, &amp; are now called by chaldean <a id="l2429"></a>names. The Iews began their civil year from the autumnal Equinox, &amp; their sacred year from the vernal: &amp; the first day of the first month was on the visible new moon, which was nearest the equinox.</p>
<p id="par151">Whether Daniel used the Chaldaick or Iewish year, is not much <a id="l2430"></a>material;  the difference <a id="l2431"></a>being but   six hours in a year, &amp; 4 months in 480 years. But I take <a id="l2432"></a>his months to be Iewish:  first, because Daniel was a Iew, &amp; the Iews <a id="l2433"></a>even by the names of the  Chaldean months understood the months <a id="l2434"></a>of their own year:    secondly, because his prophesy is grownded on <a id="l2435"></a>Ierehmiah's concerning the 70 years captivity, &amp;  therefore <a id="l2436"></a>must be understood of the same sort of years with the seventy: &amp; those <a id="l2437"></a>are Iewish,  since that prophesy was given in Iudea before the capt<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>i<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><a id="l2438"></a>vity, Ier  &amp; lastly, becaus Daniel reccons by weeks of years, which <a id="l2440"></a>is a way of recconing peculiar to the Iewish years.

The old Prophets, when they  would describe things <a id="l2698"></a>emphatically, did not only  draw parables from things <a id="l2699"></a>which offered themselves, (as from the rent of a garment, 1 Sam. <a id="l2700"></a>15. from the Sabbatick year, Isa 37. from the  vessels of a Potter, <a id="l2701"></a>Ier. 18, &amp;c.) but also when such fit objects were wanting, they <a id="l2702"></a>supplied them by their own actions, as by rending a gar<a id="l2703"></a>ment, 1 King. 11.. by shooting, 2 King. 13. by  making bare their body, <a id="l2704"></a>Isa. 20. by imposing significant names to their sons, Isa. 8. <a id="l2705"></a>Hos. 1. by hiding a girdle in the bank of Euphrates, Ier. 13. <a id="l2706"></a>by breaking a Potter's vessel, Ier. 19. by putting on fetters <a id="l2707"></a>&amp; yokes, Ier 27. by binding a book to a stone, &amp; casting <a id="l2708"></a>them both into Euphrates, Ier. 51. by besieging a painted city, <a id="l2709"></a>Ezek 4. by dividing hair into three parts, Ezek.5. by making <a id="l2710"></a>a chain, Ezek. 7. by carrying out household stuff like a captive <a id="l2711"></a>&amp; trembling, Ezek. 12, &amp;c. By such kind of types the Prophets <a id="l2712"></a>loved to speake. And Christ being endued with a nobler Prophe<a id="l2713"></a>tick spirit than the rest, excelled also in this kind of speaking, <a id="l2714"></a>yet so as not to speak by his own actions, (that was less <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p056r"> &lt;56r&gt; </span> grave &amp; decent) but to turn  into Parables  such things  as <a id="l2716"></a>offered themselves. On occasion of the Harvest approaching, he <a id="l2717"></a>admonishes his disciples once &amp; again of the spiritual harvest, <a id="l2718"></a>Iohn 4.35. Matt. 9.37. Seeing the Lillys of the field, he admonishes <a id="l2719"></a>his disciples about gay clothing, Mat. 6.28. In allusion to the pre<a id="l2720"></a>sent  season of  fruits, he admonishes his disciples about knowing <a id="l2721"></a>men by their fruits, Matt. 7.16. In the time of the Passover, <a id="l2722"></a>when trees sent forth leaves, he  bids <sup class="note" id="n134-ref">[134]</sup>his disciples <em class="underline">Learn a parable from <a id="l2723"></a>the figg tree: when  its branch is yet tender &amp; putteth forth <a id="l2724"></a>leaves, ye know that summer is nigh</em>, &amp;c Matt. 24.32. Luke 21..29. <a id="l2725"></a>The same day, alluding both to the season of the year &amp; to his <a id="l2726"></a>passion which was to be two days after, he formed a Parable <a id="l2727"></a>of the time of fruits approaching, &amp; the  murdering of the <a id="l2728"></a>heir, Mat. 21.33.   At the same time, alluding both to the money-changers whom he <a id="l2729"></a>had newly  driven out of the Temple, &amp; to his passion at <a id="l2730"></a>hand; he made a parable of a  Noble-man going into a far country <a id="l2731"></a>to receive a kingdom &amp; return, &amp; delivering his goods to his servants, <a id="l2732"></a>&amp; at his return condemning the slothfull servant because he <a id="l2733"></a> put not his money to the exchangers, Mat. 25.14. Luc. 19.12. <a id="l2734"></a>Being near the Temple where sheep were kept in folds to be <a id="l2735"></a>sold for the sacrifices, he spake many things parabolically of <a id="l2736"></a>sheep, of the shepherd, &amp; of the door of the sheepfold; &amp; discovers <a id="l2737"></a>that he alluded to the sheepfolds which were to be hired in <a id="l2738"></a>the market place, by speaking of such folds  as  a <a id="l2739"></a>theif could not enter  by the door, nor the shepherd himself opened, <a id="l2740"></a>but a porter opened to the shepherd, Iohn 10.1, 3. Being in the <a id="l2741"></a>mount of Olives, (Matt. 36.30. Iohn 14.31)  a place so <a id="l2742"></a>fertile that it could not want vines, he spake many things <a id="l2743"></a>mystically of the Husbandmen, &amp; of the vine &amp; its branches <a id="l2744"></a>Iohn 15. Meeting a blind man, he admonished of spiritual <a id="l2745"></a>blindness, Iohn 9.39.  At the sight of little children, he <a id="l2746"></a>described once &amp; again the innocence of  the elect, <a id="l2747"></a>Mat. 18.2 &amp; 19.13.   Knowing that Lazarus was <a id="l2748"></a>dead &amp; should be raised again, he discourses of the resurrection <a id="l2749"></a>&amp; life eternal, Iohn 11.25, 26. Hearing of the slaughter <a id="l2750"></a>of some whome Pilat had slain, he admonished of eternal <a id="l2751"></a>death, Luk. 13.1. To his fishermen he speaks of fishers of <a id="l2752"></a>men, Mat 4.10 &amp; composes another parable about fishes, Mat. <a id="l2753"></a>13.47. Being by the Temple, he spake of the Temple of <a id="l2754"></a>his body, Iohn 2.19. At supper he spake a parable about <a id="l2755"></a>the mystical supper to come in the kingdom of heaven, <a id="l2756"></a>Luk 14. On occasion of temporal food, he admonished his <a id="l2757"></a>disciples of spiritual food, &amp; of eating his flesh &amp; drinking his blood mystically, <a id="l2758"></a>Iohn 6.27, 53. When  his disciples wanted bread he bids them beware <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p057r"> &lt;57r&gt; </span> of the leven of the Pharisees, Matt. 16.6. Being desired to <a id="l2759"></a>eat, he answered that he had other  meat, Iohn 4.31. In <a id="l2760"></a>the great day of the feast of Tabernacles, when the <a id="l2761"></a>Iews, as their custome was, brought a great quantity of waters <a id="l2762"></a>from the river Shiloah into the Temple, Christ stood &amp; cried, saying, <em class="underline">If any <a id="l2763"></a>man thirst let him come to me &amp; drink. He that believeth <a id="l2764"></a>on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water</em>, <a id="l2765"></a>Iohn 7.37. The next day, in allusion to the servants who <a id="l2766"></a>by reason of the sabbatical year were newly set free, he said, <a id="l2767"></a><em class="underline">If ye continue in my word,  the truth shall make you <a id="l2768"></a>free</em>. Which the Iews understanding litterally  with respect to the present <a id="l2769"></a>manumission of servants, answered, <em class="underline">We</em>  <a id="l2770"></a><em class="underline">be Abraham's seed, &amp; were never in bondage to any man: <a id="l2771"></a>how sayest thou, ye shall be made free?</em> Iohn. 8. They assert <a id="l2772"></a>their freedom by a double argument: first, because they were <a id="l2773"></a>the seed of Abraham, &amp; therefore  newly <a id="l2774"></a>made free, had they been ever in  bondage; &amp; then, because <a id="l2775"></a>they never were in bondage.
