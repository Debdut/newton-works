<p id="par2">They followed vanity &amp; became vain &amp; went after the heathen <a id="l5"></a>that were round about them concerning whom the Lord had said that <a id="l6"></a>they should not do like them. And they left all the commandements of <a id="l7"></a>the Lord their God &amp; made them molten images even two calves <a id="l8"></a>&amp; made a grove &amp; worshipped all the host of heaven &amp; <a id="l9"></a>served Baal.</p>
<p id="par3">Having had formerly occasion to disourse of these words <a id="l10"></a>I told you how the designe of the place was to describe the capti<a id="l11"></a>vity of the  ten tribes by the Assyrians &amp; the abominations <a id="l12"></a>for which they were captivated &amp; the religion of the nations <a id="l13"></a>which the assyrians placed in Samaria in the seats of the capti<a id="l14"></a>vated Israelites: which religion was that these nations joyned <a id="l15"></a>together the worship of the true God in the Calves of Iereboam <a id="l16"></a>&amp; the worship of the fals Gods of the Gentiles round about <a id="l17"></a>in their several Idols even as the Israelites had joyned <a id="l18"></a>them before. ffor the better understanding the tenour &amp; force <a id="l19"></a>of the place I laid down these six particulars. 1<sup>st</sup> That <a id="l20"></a>the Israelites acknowledged &amp; worshipped the true God at the <a id="l21"></a>same time that they worshipped the Gods of the Gentiles. 2 That they <a id="l22"></a>&amp; the nations which succeeded them in the Cities of Lana<a id="l23"></a>ria worshipped the true God in the calves of Ieroboam <a id="l24"></a>3 That this worship was Idolatry notwithstanding that <a id="l25"></a>it was performed to the true God: &amp; by parity of reason <a id="l26"></a>that the worship of the true God by any Image which <a id="l27"></a>he has not commanded, (as indeed he has commanded none) <a id="l28"></a>is Idolatry. 4 That generally the Israelites &amp; Gentiles <a id="l29"></a>worshipped not mere Images as Gods themselves but only <a id="l30"></a>as dedicated to their several Gods. 5 That the ancient <a id="l31"></a>Idolaters, as many of them as acknowledged the true God, <a id="l32"></a>did not esteem any of their other Gods equal to him <a id="l33"></a>but accounted them only finite beings &amp; for the most part <a id="l34"></a>the souls of men deceased, who for the eminent passage of <a id="l35"></a>their life here they supposed were after death rewarded <a id="l36"></a>with power more or less over this world, to do good or <a id="l37"></a>hurt therein  subordinately not only to the supreme <a id="l38"></a>God but even to some others of their imagined Gods. Lastly <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span>that the glory of the true God which Idolaters gave unto their <a id="l39"></a>Idols, was not any of his attributes as some are ready to <a id="l40"></a>suppose, but only this: To love, to fear, to trust in, &amp; to <a id="l41"></a> seek unto those Gods for the temporal blessings of this <a id="l42"></a>life, for which the true God has appointed us to love fear <a id="l43"></a>trust in &amp; seek unto none but himself immediately.  <a id="l44"></a>And consequently to do any of these things in a religious <a id="l45"></a>way to any other then the true god, is so far to depart <a id="l46"></a>from him &amp; give his glory to another: the great crime <a id="l47"></a>of which Idolaters stand accused.</p>
<p id="par4">ffor evincing the first of these particulars *<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 2v &gt; </span> * that the Israelites acknowledged &amp; worshipped the true God at the <a id="l48"></a>same time that they worshipped the Gods of the Gentiles.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 3r resumes &gt; </span> I produced <a id="l49"></a>several places of scripture which I shall not repeat: only the <a id="l50"></a>last of them I named, I shall remind you of that I may <a id="l51"></a>explain it a little further. It was in Ier 44.25, 26 <a id="l52"></a>where a hand of Iews which in the time of Nebuchadnez<a id="l53"></a>zars captivity fled into Ægypt, vowed in the  name of <a id="l54"></a>the Lord to worship the Queen of heaven. The words <a id="l55"></a>run thus. Hear the word of the lord all Iudah that are <a id="l56"></a>in the Land of Egypt: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the <a id="l57"></a>God of Israel, saying Ye &amp; your wives have both spoken <a id="l58"></a>with your mouth &amp; fulfilled with your hands, saying, We <a id="l59"></a>will surely perform our vows that we have vowed to <a id="l60"></a>burn incense to the Queen of heaven &amp; to pour out <a id="l61"></a>drink offrings unto her: Ye will surely accomplish your <a id="l62"></a>vows &amp; surely perform your vows. Therefore hear ye <a id="l63"></a>the word of the Lord all Iudah that dwell in the Land <a id="l64"></a>of Egypt, Behold I have sworn by my great name <a id="l65"></a>saith the Lord that my name shall be no more named <a id="l66"></a>in the mouth of any man of Iudah in all the Land of <a id="l67"></a>Egypt saying; The Lord God liveth. In the 42<sup>th</sup> Chapter <a id="l68"></a>the remnant of the people which scaped the  hands of <a id="l69"></a>the king of Babylon, &amp; remained in the land after the <a id="l70"></a>captivity &amp; burning of Ierusalem, came to Ieremiah &amp; said <a id="l71"></a>to him: Let, we beseech thee our supplication be accepted bef<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ore<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l72"></a>the &amp; pray for us unto the Lord thy God, even for all this <a id="l73"></a>remnant, that the Lord thy God may shew us the way wherein <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> we may walk &amp; the thing that we may do. After a <a id="l74"></a>few days Ieremiah returned them answer from the <a id="l75"></a>Lord that if they went into Egypt, as they designed, <a id="l76"></a>they should surely be cut off there by the armies <a id="l77"></a>of the king of Babylon, but if they stayd in their <a id="l78"></a>own land it should be well with them. But this <a id="l79"></a>answer being contrary to their inclination, they replied to <a id="l80"></a>Ieremiah, Thou speakest falsly, The Lord our God <a id="l81"></a>hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn <a id="l82"></a>there. Here you see the people acknowledged the true <a id="l83"></a>God, the God of Ieremiah whom they called their own God, &amp; made their applicati<a id="l84"></a>ons to him to know whether they should go into <a id="l85"></a>Egypt or stay in their Land. And when they received <a id="l86"></a>answer that they should stay they did not  thereupon <a id="l87"></a>reject their God, &amp; say we will  not obey him <a id="l88"></a>but only blamed the Prophet as if he had  feigned un<a id="l89"></a>to them, &amp; not spoken to them from the Lord. Vpon <a id="l90"></a>this therefore they went into Egypt, &amp; what they did <a id="l91"></a>there you have described in the 44<sup>th</sup> Chapter,  <a id="l92"></a>the 7<sup>th</sup> &amp; following verses, where Ieremiah is sent to <a id="l93"></a>reprove them for their Idolatry, with this message. Thus <a id="l94"></a>saith the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, Where<a id="l95"></a>fore commit ye this great evil against your souls to cut <a id="l96"></a>off from you man &amp; woman child &amp; suckling out of <a id="l97"></a>Iudah to leave you none to remain: In that ye pro<a id="l98"></a>voke me to wrath with the works of your hands burn<a id="l99"></a>ing incence unto other Gods in the land of Egypt, <a id="l100"></a>whether ye be gone to dwell. – Have ye forgotten the <a id="l101"></a>wickedness of your fathers &amp; the wickedness of the kings <a id="l102"></a>of Iudah &amp; the wickedness of their wives, &amp; your <a id="l103"></a>own wickedness &amp; the wickedness of your wives which they <a id="l104"></a>have committed in the land of Iudah &amp; in the streets of <a id="l105"></a>Ierusalem? They are not humbled even unto this day <a id="l106"></a>Neither have they feared nor walked in my law nor <a id="l107"></a>in my statutes that I set before you &amp; before your fathers. <a id="l108"></a>Therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the God of <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Israel<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span>Behold I will set my face against you for evil, even to <a id="l109"></a>cut of all Iudah. These men you see  then were <a id="l110"></a>Idolaters in their own land before the captivity <a id="l111"></a>&amp; in Egypt after it. In the midst of their abomina<a id="l112"></a>tions it was that they  came to Ieremiah to enquire of <a id="l113"></a>the Lord, &amp; now when Ieremiah was sent to em to  <a id="l114"></a> denounce Gods judgments on 'em for their doings <a id="l115"></a>&amp; exhort them to repentance &amp; they replied that <a id="l116"></a>they would  not hearken to him but keep to that <a id="l117"></a>worship which they &amp; their fathers had used before in <a id="l118"></a>Ierusalem, the Prophet  answers: Thus saith the Lord <a id="l119"></a>God of Israel, saying ye &amp; your wives have both spoken <a id="l120"></a>with your mouth &amp; fulfilled with your hands  <a id="l121"></a>saying: We will surely perform our vows that we have <a id="l122"></a>vowed to burn incense to the Queen of heaven &amp; to <a id="l123"></a>pour  out drink offerings unto her. Ye will surely <a id="l124"></a>accomplish your vows &amp; surely perform your vows <a id="l125"></a>Therefore heare ye the word of the Lord all ye that <a id="l126"></a>dwell in the Land of Egypt: Behold I have sworn by <a id="l127"></a>my great name saith the Lord that my name shall <a id="l128"></a>be no more named in the mouth of any man of Iudah <a id="l129"></a>in all the land of Egypt saying the Lord God liveth <a id="l130"></a>Hitherto then notwithstanding their Idolatry, the name of <a id="l131"></a>the Lord continued among them, &amp; because they vowed by <a id="l132"></a>it to worship the Queen of heaven &amp; upon Ieremiahs <a id="l133"></a>reproving them replied that they would perform their vows <a id="l134"></a>therefore God threatens that his name should be no more <a id="l135"></a>named among them to say, the Lord God liveth. You <a id="l136"></a>are to know that this saying the Lord God liveth was their <a id="l137"></a>  usual way of invoking  God when they would  solemn<a id="l138"></a>ly sweare by him. An evident instance of this you <a id="l139"></a>have in Ier. 38.16, where Zedekiah the king of Iudah demanding <a id="l140"></a>the word of the Lord of Ieremiah, &amp; Ieremiah fearing <a id="l141"></a>least the King should put him to death for telling it him <a id="l142"></a>it is said that the king sware secretly to Ieremiah saying <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span>As the Lord liveth that made this soule, I will not <a id="l143"></a>put thee to death. So; (as I told you formerly,) the Israelites <a id="l144"></a>when they went to worship the Calves at Bethel &amp; Gilgal <a id="l145"></a>used to swear after this manner, &amp; therefore in Hosea 4.<a id="l146"></a>15 God commands that Iudah do not imitate Israel in this <a id="l147"></a>point: Though Israel, saith he, play the harlot, yet let <a id="l148"></a>not Iudah offend, &amp; come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go <a id="l149"></a>ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The Lord liveth. This <a id="l150"></a>then was their solemn way of swearing, &amp; as the ten Tribes <a id="l151"></a>used it in their religion toward the calves so the  <a id="l152"></a>Iews in Egypt used it in their religion towards their Idols <a id="l153"></a>ffor had not their vows to worship the Queen of heaven <a id="l154"></a>been done in the name of the Lord it would have been <a id="l155"></a>incoherent to say, Because ye have vowed to worship <a id="l156"></a>the Queen of heaven &amp; say ye will perform your vows <a id="l157"></a>therefore my name shall be no more named among <a id="l158"></a>you, saying, the Lord liveth. Tis certain therefore that <a id="l159"></a>these vows were done in Gods name &amp; consequently that <a id="l160"></a>in the midst of their Idolatry they retained a religion <a id="l161"></a>toward the true God &amp; thought the worshipping other Gods <a id="l162"></a>well pleasing to him: yea that they retained a more <a id="l163"></a>especial regard to the true God then to any other &amp; <a id="l164"></a>performed their worship to others, with reverence to him. <a id="l165"></a>ffor why els did they not in the worshipping the Queen <a id="l166"></a>of heaven vow by her name rather then by the <a id="l167"></a>name of the Lord? Why did they plead their vow in <a id="l168"></a>such a manner as if they should be wanting in their <a id="l169"></a> duty to the true God if they did not acord<a id="l170"></a>ing to their vow worship the Queen of heaven? But <a id="l171"></a>how ever it be, this I have plainly shewed that these <a id="l172"></a>Idolaters both before they went into Egypt &amp; when they <a id="l173"></a>were there retained  a religion towards the true <a id="l174"></a>God, &amp; if you further consider  the way by which  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span>God threatened to put an end to their vowing by his  <a id="l176"></a>name you may perceive they continued it till, for <a id="l177"></a>their Idolatry, they were destroyed. Because, says God, ye <a id="l178"></a>have vowed to worship the Queen of heaven &amp; say ye <a id="l179"></a>will perform your vows therefore my name shall <a id="l180"></a>be no more named in  the mouth of any man of <a id="l181"></a>Iudah in all the land of Egypt saying the Lord God <a id="l182"></a>liveth: – for all the men of Iudah that are in the <a id="l183"></a>land of Egypt shall be  consumed by the sword <a id="l184"></a>&amp; by the famin untill there be an end of them. <a id="l185"></a>This was the means by which God foretold them he would <a id="l186"></a>put an end to their swearing by his name &amp; conse<a id="l187"></a>quently they retained a religion to the true God &amp; fals <a id="l188"></a>Gods together all the while they lived in Egypt.</p>
<p id="par5">Having thus at large given you the import of this <a id="l189"></a>place I shall now pass on to another. In Ezek 14. <a id="l190"></a>in the former part of the Chapter you have the <a id="l191"></a>Elders of Israel in the midst of their Idolatries committed <a id="l192"></a>before the captivity comeing to enquire of the true God &amp; God rejects them <a id="l193"></a>because of their Idols. The place runs thus. Then <a id="l194"></a>came certain of the Elders of Israel unto me &amp; sat <a id="l195"></a>before me. And the word of the Lord came unto me saying <a id="l196"></a>Son of man these men have set up their Idols in <a id="l197"></a>their heart, &amp; put the stumbling block of their iniqui<a id="l198"></a>ty before their face: should I be enquired of at <a id="l199"></a>all by them? Therefore speak unto them &amp; say unto y<sup>m</sup> <a id="l200"></a>Thus saith the Lord God, Every man of the house of <a id="l201"></a>Israel that setteth up his Idols in his heart &amp; <a id="l202"></a>putteth the stumbling block of his iniquity before his <a id="l203"></a>face &amp; cometh to the Prophet, I the Lord will answer <a id="l204"></a>him that cometh according to the multitude of his Idols. <a id="l205"></a>That I may take the house of Israel in their own <a id="l206"></a>heart because they are all estranged from me throug<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>h<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span>their Idols. This place seems so evident as to need no <a id="l207"></a>explaining. But yet because there may be some scruple <a id="l208"></a>about their setting up Idols in their heart as if that <a id="l209"></a>expression might imply that they were not Idolaters in their <a id="l210"></a>external acts of worship but onely in their heart, I shall <a id="l211"></a>hereafter say something to cleare that expression &amp; then <a id="l212"></a>add an observation or two upon the place together with <a id="l213"></a>some other passages of scripture to the same purpose: by which <a id="l214"></a>I hope to make it appeare that the Iews &amp; Israelites scarce <a id="l215"></a>ever so followed other Gods as to forsake their own unlesse <a id="l216"></a>perhaps in the  reign of Ahab when Iezebel a for<a id="l217"></a>reign woman endeavoured to extirpate the religion of the <a id="l218"></a>Israelites &amp; bring in that of her own Country.</p> </div>
