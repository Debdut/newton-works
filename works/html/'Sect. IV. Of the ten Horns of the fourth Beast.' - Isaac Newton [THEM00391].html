<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Sect.  IV. <a id="l1"></a><br>Of the ten Horns of the <a id="l2"></a>fourth Beast.</h2>
<p id="par1">Dacia was a large country bounded on the south by the Danube <a id="l3"></a>on the east by the Euxine Sea, on the north by the river Neister <a id="l4"></a>&amp; the mountain Crapac &amp; on the west by the river Tibesis or <a id="l5"></a>Teys which runs southward into the Danube a little above Bel<a id="l6"></a>grade, &amp; comprehended the countries now called Transylvania <a id="l7"></a>Moldavia &amp; Wallachia &amp; the eastern part of the upper Hun<a id="l8"></a>gary. The ancient inhabitants were called Getæ by the Greeks, <a id="l9"></a>Daci by the Latines &amp; Goths by themselves. Alexander the <a id="l10"></a>great attaqued them, &amp; Trajan conquered them &amp; reduced their <a id="l11"></a>country into a Province of the Roman Empire, &amp; thereby <a id="l12"></a>the propagation of the Gospel among them was much promoted. <a id="l13"></a>They were composed of several Gothic nations called Ostrogoths <a id="l14"></a>Visigoths, Vandals, Gepides, Lombards, Burgundians Alans &amp;c all <a id="l15"></a>which agreed in their manners &amp; spake the same language as <a id="l16"></a>Procopius represents. While they lived under the Romans the <a id="l17"></a>Goths or Ostrogoths were seated in the eastern parts of Dacia, the <a id="l18"></a>Vandals in the western part upon the river Teys where the <a id="l19"></a>rivers Maresh &amp; Keresh run into it. The Visigoths were <a id="l20"></a>between them. The Gepides were (according to Iornandes) upon <a id="l21"></a>the Vistula. The Burgundians (a Vandalic nation) were between <a id="l22"></a>the Vistula, &amp; the southern fountain of the Boristhenes at some <a id="l23"></a>distance from the mountain Crapac northwards where Ptolomy places <a id="l24"></a>them by the names of Phrugundiones &amp; Burgiones. The Alans <a id="l25"></a>(another <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> Gothic nation) were between the northern fountain <a id="l26"></a>of the Boristhenes &amp; the mouth of the river Tanais where <a id="l27"></a>Ptolomy places the mountain Alanus. The Roxolani were <a id="l28"></a>on the southern coast of the Alans  &amp; western side of <a id="l29"></a>the Palus Mæotis. </p> 
<p id="par2"> These nations continued under the Romans till the <a id="l31"></a>second year of the Emperor Philip &amp; then for want of <a id="l32"></a>their pay began to revolt &amp; the Ostrogoths set up a kingdom <a id="l33"></a>which under their kings Ostrogotha, Cniva, Araric, Geberic &amp; <a id="l34"></a>Hermaneric  increased till till the year 376, &amp; then by an <a id="l35"></a>incursion of the Hunns from beyond the Tanais &amp; the death <a id="l36"></a>of Hermaneric brake into several smaller  kingdoms; <a id="l37"></a>Hunnimund the son of Hermaneric reigning over the Ostrogoths; <a id="l38"></a>Fridigern over the Visigoths; Winither or Vithimar over  <a id="l39"></a>a part of the Goths called Gruthungi by Ammian, Gothunni <a id="l40"></a>by Claudian, &amp; Sarmatæ &amp; Scythians by others; Athanaric <a id="l41"></a>over another part of the Goths in Dacia called Thervingi <a id="l42"></a>&amp; Box over the Antes in Sarmatia. And the Gepides <a id="l43"></a>had also their king. The Vandals fled over the Danube <a id="l44"></a>from Geberic in the latter end of the reign of Constantine <a id="l45"></a>the Great &amp; had seats granted them in Pannonia by that <a id="l46"></a>Emperor &amp; there lived quietly forty years, viz<sup>t</sup>  till the <a id="l47"></a>year 376 or 377 when several Gothic nations flying from the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> Hunns came over the Danube &amp; had seats granted them in Mœsia <a id="l48"></a>&amp; Thrace by the Emperor Valens, but the next year A.C. 378 <a id="l49"></a>revolted, called in  some Goths Alans &amp; Hunns from beyond <a id="l50"></a>the Danube, routed the Roman army slew the Emperor Valens <a id="l51"></a>&amp; spread themselves into Greece &amp; Pannonia as far as to the <a id="l52"></a>Alps. But in the years 379 &amp; 380 they were checkt by the arms of <a id="l53"></a>the Emperors Gratian &amp; Theodosius &amp; made a submissive peace &amp; the <a id="l54"></a>Visigoths &amp; Thervingi returned to their seats in Mœsia &amp; <a id="l55"></a>Thrace, the Hunns retired over the Danube, &amp; the Alans &amp; Gru<a id="l56"></a>thungi obteined seats in Pannonia.</p>

<p id="par4"> About the year 373 or 374 the Burgundians rose from their <a id="l64"></a>seats  upon the Vistula with an army of eighty thousand <a id="l65"></a>men to invade Gallia, &amp; being opposed, seated themselves upon <a id="l66"></a>the further side of the Rhene above Mentz. And in the year <a id="l67"></a>358 a body of the Salian Franks with their king were received <a id="l68"></a>into the Empire by the Emperor Iulian and seated in Gallia <a id="l69"></a>between Brabant &amp; the Rhene. And their king Mellobandes was <a id="l70"></a>made Comes Domesticorum by the Emperor Gratian. And Richo<a id="l71"></a>mer another noble Frank was made Comes Domesticorum &amp; <a id="l72"></a>Magister utriusque Militiæby Theodosius, &amp; A.C. 384 was Consul <a id="l73"></a>with Clearchus. He was a great favorite of Theodosius &amp; accom<a id="l74"></a>panied him in his war against Eugenius, but died in the ex<a id="l75"></a>pedition &amp; left a son called Theudemir, who afterwards became <a id="l76"></a>king of the Salian Franks in Brabant. In the time of this war <a id="l77"></a>some Franks from beyond the Rhene invaded Gallia under the con<a id="l78"></a>duct of Genobald Marcomir &amp; Suno, but were repulsed by Stilico <a id="l79"></a>&amp; Marcomir being slain was succeeded in Germany by his son Phara<a id="l80"></a>mond.</p>
<p id="par5">While these nations remained quiet within the Empire subject <a id="l81"></a>to the Romans many others continued beyond the Danube till the <a id="l82"></a>death of the Emperor Theodosius &amp; then rose up in arms. For Paulus <a id="l83"></a>Diaconus in his Historia Miscella Lib. XIV, speaking of the times <a id="l84"></a>next after the death of this Emperor, tells us: Eodem tempore erant <a id="l85"></a>Gothi et aliæ gentes maximæ trans Danubium habitanes: ex quibus rationabi<a id="l86"></a>lioras quatuor sunt Gothi scilicet, Huisogothi, Gepides et Vandali, et <a id="l87"></a>nomen tantum et nihil aliud mutantes. Omnes autem fidei erant Arrianæ <a id="l88"></a>malignitatis. Isti sub Arcadio et Honoro Danubium transeuntes locati <a id="l89"></a>sunt in terra Romanorum; et Gepides quidam (ex quibus postea divisi <a id="l90"></a>sunt Langobardi et Avares) villas quæ sunt circa Singidonum &amp; Sirmium <a id="l91"></a>habitavere. And Procopius in the beginning of his Historia Vandalica <a id="l92"></a>writes to the same purpose. Hitherto the western Empire continued <a id="l93"></a>entire but now by new commotions it brake into ten kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par6">Theodosius died A.C. 395, &amp; then the Visigoths under the <a id="l94"></a>conduct of Alaric the successor of Fridigern, rose from their seats <a id="l95"></a>in Thrace &amp; wasted Macedon, Thessaly, Achaia, Peloponnesus, &amp; <a id="l96"></a>Epire with fire &amp; sword five years together, &amp; then turning westward <a id="l97"></a>invaded Dalmatia, Illyricum &amp; Pannonia, &amp; from thence went into <a id="l98"></a>Italy A.C. 402, &amp; the next year was so beaten at Pollentia &amp; Verona <a id="l99"></a>by Stilico the commander of the forces of the Western Empire that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> Claudian calls the remainder of the forces of Alaric <em class="underline">tanta ex gente reliquias breves</em> &amp; Prudentius <em class="underline">Gentem deletam</em>. Thereupon Alaric <a id="l100"></a>made peace with the Emperor, being so far humbled that Orosius tells us that he did <em class="underline">pro pace optima &amp; quibuiscunque sedibus suppliciter &amp; <a id="l101"></a>simpliciter orare</em>. This peace was ratified by mutual hostages &amp; Ætius <a id="l102"></a>was sent hostage to Alaric, &amp; therefore Alaric continued a free Prince <a id="l103"></a>in the seats now granted to him.</p>
<p id="par7"> When Alaric took up arms the nations beyond the Danube <a id="l104"></a>began to be in motion, &amp; the next winter (the winter between <a id="l105"></a>A.C. 395 &amp; A.C. 396) a great body of Hunns, Alans, Ostrogoths,  <a id="l106"></a>Gepides &amp; other  northern nations came over the frozen Danube <a id="l107"></a>being invited by Ruffin; and their brethren also who had obteined seats <a id="l108"></a>within the Empire; took up arms. Ierome calls – – – – – – – <a id="l109"></a>– – – they are still called the ten kings from their first number.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">Sect. V. <a id="l110"></a><br>Of the Eleventh horn of the fourth Beast.</h2>
<p id="par8">Now Daniel <em class="underline">considered the horns &amp; behold there came up among <a id="l111"></a>them another little horn before whom there were three of the first <a id="l112"></a>horns pluckt up by the roots, &amp; behold in this horn were eyes like <a id="l113"></a>the eyes of a man, &amp; a mouth speaking great things, &amp; its look <a id="l114"></a>was more stout then its fellows, &amp; it made war with the saints <a id="l115"></a>&amp; prevailed against them</em>. And one that stood by &amp; made Daniel <a id="l116"></a>know the interpretation of these things told him that <em class="underline">the tenn horns <a id="l117"></a>were tenn kings that should arise, &amp; another</em> [king] <em class="underline">should arise after <a id="l118"></a>them &amp; be divers from the first</em> [ten kings] <em class="underline">&amp; subdue three kings <a id="l119"></a>&amp; speak great words against the most High &amp; weare out the <a id="l120"></a>saints &amp; think to change times &amp; laws &amp; that they should be given <a id="l121"></a>into his hands for a time times &amp; half a time</em>. Kings are here <a id="l122"></a>put for kingdoms as above, &amp; therefore the little horn is a <a id="l123"></a>little kingdom. It was a horn of the fourth Beast &amp; rooted up three of his first horns &amp; therefore <a id="l124"></a>we are to look for it among the nations of the Latine Empire <a id="l125"></a>after the rise of the ten horns. But it was a kingdom of a different <a id="l126"></a>kind from the other ten kingdoms, having a life or soul peculiar <a id="l127"></a>to it self with eyes &amp; a mouth. By its eyes it was a Seer, &amp; by its <a id="l128"></a>mouth speaking great things &amp; changing times &amp; laws it was <a id="l129"></a>a Prophet as well as a king. And such a Seer a Prophet &amp; a <a id="l130"></a>King was the Church of Rome</p>
<p id="par9"> A Seer, Ἐπίσκοπος is a Bishop in the litteral sense of the <a id="l131"></a>word, &amp; this Church claims the universal Bishopric</p>
<p id="par10"> With his mouth he gives laws to kings &amp; nations as an <a id="l132"></a>Oracle &amp; pretends to infallibility &amp; that his dictates are binding <a id="l133"></a>to the whole world, which is to be a Prophet in the highest degree.</p>
<p id="par11"> In the eighth century by rooting up &amp; subduing the Exarchate <a id="l134"></a>of Ravenna the kingdom of the Lombards, &amp; the Senate &amp; Dukedome of Rome, <a id="l135"></a>he acquired Peters Patrimony out of their dominions, &amp; thereby <a id="l136"></a>rose up as a temporal Prince or King or horn of the fourth Beast.</p>
<p id="par12">In a small book printed at Paris A.C. 1689 &amp; entituled, <a id="l137"></a>An historical  dissertation upon some coins of Charles the <a id="l138"></a>great, Ludovicus Pius, Lotharius, &amp; their successors stamped at <a id="l139"></a>Rome,  it is re<a id="l140"></a>corded that in the days of Pope Leo X, there was remaining in <a id="l141"></a>the Vatican, &amp; till those days exposed to publick view an Inscription <a id="l142"></a>in honour of Pipin the father of Charles the great, commemorating, <a id="l143"></a><em class="underline">Pipinum pium primum fuisse qui amplificandæ Ecclesiæ Romanæ viam <a id="l144"></a>apperuerit, Exarchatu Ravennate, &amp; plurimis alijs oblatis</em>, that Pipin the Pious was the first who opened a way to the grandeur of the Church <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> of Rome, conferring upon her the Exarchate of Ravenna <a id="l145"></a>&amp; many other oblations. In &amp; before the reign of the <a id="l146"></a>Emperors Gratian &amp; Theodosius, the Bishop of Rome lived <a id="l147"></a>splendidly, but this was by the oblations of the Roman Ladies <a id="l148"></a>as Ammianus describes. After those reigns Italy was invaded <a id="l149"></a>by forreign nations &amp; did not get rid of her troubles before the fall <a id="l150"></a>of the kingdom of Lombardy. It was certainly by the victory <a id="l151"></a>of the sea of Rome over the Greek Emperor, the king of <a id="l152"></a>Lombardy, &amp; the Senate of Rome, that she acquired Peters Patrimony <a id="l153"></a>&amp; rose up to her greatness. The Donation of Constantine the great is a fiction, &amp; ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 3v &gt; </span> &amp; so is that of the Alpes Cottiæ being given to the Pope by Aripert king of the Lombards.

<p id="par13"> The worship of dead saints called Mahuzzims by Daniel was introduced <a id="l157"></a>by the Monks in the 4<sup>th</sup> 5<sup>th</sup> &amp; 6<sup>th</sup> centuries &amp; soon after arose a dispute about <a id="l158"></a>worshipping their images, the Greek Emperor Phillippicus A.C. 411 or 412 declaring <a id="l159"></a>against it.</p> 
<p id="par14">In the year 726<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup>  the Emperor Leo Isaurus to put a stop <a id="l160"></a>to  it called a meeting of Councillors &amp; Bishops <a id="l161"></a>in his Palace &amp; by their advice put out an Edict against that <a id="l162"></a>worship, &amp; wrote to Pope Gregory the second that a general Council <a id="l163"></a>might be called. But the Pope thereupon called a council at Rome, <a id="l164"></a>confirmed the worship of Images, excommunicated the Greek <a id="l165"></a>Emperor, absolved the people from their allegiance, &amp; forbad them <a id="l166"></a>to pay tribute or otherwise to be obedient to  him. And <a id="l167"></a>the people of Rome &amp; Campania &amp; Ravenna &amp; Pentapolis with the <a id="l168"></a>cities under them, revolted, &amp; laid violent hands upon their Magistrates <a id="l169"></a>killing the Exarch Paul at Ravenna &amp; laying aside Peter Duke of <a id="l170"></a>Rome who was become blind. And when Exhileratus Duke of <a id="l171"></a>Campania incited the people against the Pope, the Romans invaded Campania &amp; slew him with his son Hadrian. Then a new Exarch <a id="l172"></a>Eutychius coming to Naples, sent some secretly to take away <a id="l173"></a>the lives of the Pope &amp; Nobles of Rome; but the plot being <a id="l174"></a>discovered, the Romans revolted absolutely from the Greek <a id="l175"></a>Empire, &amp; took an oath to preserve the life of the Pope, &amp; to <a id="l176"></a>defend their state, &amp; be obedient to their authority in all things. Thus <a id="l177"></a>Rome with its Dutchy including part of Tuscia &amp; part of Campania <a id="l178"></a>revolted in the year 726 &amp; became a free state under the <a id="l179"></a>Government of the Senate  of this city, &amp; the <a id="l180"></a>authority of the Senate in civil affairs was henceforward <a id="l181"></a>absolute, the authority of the Pope extending hitherto no <a id="l182"></a>farther than to the affairs of the Church.</p>
<p id="par15"><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup>At that time the Lombards also being zealous for the worship <a id="l183"></a>of Images &amp; pretending to favour the cause of the Pope, invaded <a id="l184"></a>the cities of the Exarchate. And at length, A.C. 752, they took <a id="l185"></a>Ravenna &amp; put an end to the Exarchate; &amp; this was the first of <a id="l186"></a>the three  kingdoms which fell before the little horn. </p>
<p id="par16"><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup>Pope Zechary  this same year deposed Childeric a <a id="l187"></a>sloathfull &amp; useless king of France &amp; the last of the race of <a id="l188"></a>Merovæus, &amp; absolving his subjects from their oath of alle<a id="l189"></a>giance, gave the kingdom to Pipin the Major of the Palace, &amp; <a id="l190"></a>thereby made a new &amp; potent friend. <sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup>And his successor Pope Stephen knowing better <a id="l191"></a>how to deal with the Greek Emperor than with the Lombards <a id="l192"></a> went the next year to the king of the Lombards to per<a id="l193"></a>swade him to return the Exarchate to the  Emperor. <a id="l194"></a>But this not succeeding, he went into France &amp; persuaded <a id="l195"></a>Pipin to take the Exarchate &amp; Pentapolis from the <a id="l196"></a>Lombards &amp; give it to S<sup>t</sup> Peter. And accordingly Pipin A.C. 454 came with an army into Italy &amp; made Aistulphus king of the Lombards <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> promise the surrender. But the next year Aistulphus on the <a id="l197"></a>contrary, to revenge himself on the Pope, besieged the city of <a id="l198"></a>Rome. Whereupon  the Pope sent letters to Pipin wherein <a id="l199"></a>he told him that if he came not speedily against the Lom<a id="l200"></a>bards, <em class="underline">pro data sibi potentia alienandum fore a regno Dei et <a id="l201"></a>vita æterna</em>, he should be excommunicated. Pipin therefore <a id="l202"></a>fearing a revolt of his new subjects, &amp; being indebted to the <a id="l203"></a>Church of Rome, came speedily with an army into Italy, <a id="l204"></a>raised the siege, besieged the Lombards in Papia, &amp; forced them <a id="l205"></a>to surrender the Exarchate &amp; region of Pentapolis to the Pope <a id="l206"></a>for a perpetual possession. Thus the Pope became Lord of Ra<a id="l207"></a>venna &amp; the Exarchate, some few cities excepted, &amp; the Keys <a id="l208"></a>were sent to Rome, &amp; laid upon the Confession of S<sup>t</sup> Peter,  <a id="l209"></a>that is upon  his Tomb at the High Altar, <a id="l210"></a><em class="underline">in signum veri perpetuique dominijs sed pietate Regis gratuita</em> <a id="l211"></a>as the inscription of a coin of Pipin hath it. This was in <a id="l212"></a>the year of Christ 755. And henceforward the Popes being <a id="l213"></a>temporal Princes left off in their Epistles &amp; Bulls to note <a id="l214"></a>the years of the Greek Emperors as they had hitherto done</p>
<p id="par17"><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>After this, the Lombards invading the Popes countries, Pope <a id="l215"></a>Adrian sent to Charles the great the son &amp; successor of Pipin to <a id="l216"></a>come to his assistance. And accordingly Charles entred Italy with <a id="l217"></a>an army, invaded the Lombards, overthrew their kingdom, <a id="l218"></a>became master of their countries, &amp; restored to the Pope <a id="l219"></a>not only what they had taken from him, but also the rest <a id="l220"></a>of the Exarchate which they had promised Pipin to surrender <a id="l221"></a>to him but had hitherto deteined, &amp; also gave him some cities <a id="l222"></a>of the Lombards, &amp; was mutually made Patricius by the Ro<a id="l223"></a>mans, &amp; had the authority of confirming the elections <a id="l224"></a>of the Popes conferred upon him. These things were done <a id="l225"></a>in the years 773 &amp; 774. And this was the second kingdom <a id="l226"></a>which fell before the little horn. But Rome which was to <a id="l227"></a>be the seat of his kingdom was not yet his own.</p>
<p id="par18"><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> In the year 796 Leo III being made Pope, notified <a id="l228"></a>his election to Charles the great by his Legates, sending him <a id="l229"></a>for a present the golden keys of the Confession of Peter &amp; <a id="l230"></a>the Banner of the city of Rome; the first as an acknow<a id="l231"></a>ledgement of the Popes holding the cities of the Exarchate <a id="l232"></a>&amp; Lombardy by the grant of Charles, the other as a signi<a id="l233"></a>fication that Charles should come &amp; subdue the Senate &amp; <a id="l234"></a>people of Rome, as he had done the Exarchate &amp; the kingdom <a id="l235"></a>of the Lombards. For the Pope at the same time desired Charles <a id="l236"></a>to send some of his Princes to Rome who might subject the <a id="l237"></a>Roman people to him &amp; bind them by oath <em class="underline">in fide &amp; subjectione</em> <a id="l238"></a>in fealty &amp; subjection, as his words are recited by Sigonius. <a id="l239"></a>An anonymous Poet published  by Boeclerus at Stras<a id="l240"></a>burgh, expresses it thus</p> 
<div class="lg">
<p class="l">Admonuitque pijs precibus, qui mittere vellet</p>
<p class="l">Ex proprijs aliquos primoribus, ac sibi plebem</p>
<p class="l">Subdere. Romanam, servadaque fœdera cogens</p>
<p class="l">Hanc fidei sacramentis promittere magnis.</p>
</div>
<p id="par19">Hence arose a misunderstanding between the Pope &amp; the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> city. And the Romans about two or three years after, by the assistance of the Clergy <a id="l241"></a>raised so great tumults against him as gave occasion to a new state <a id="l242"></a>of things in all the west. For two of the clergy accused him of <a id="l243"></a>certain crimes &amp; by an armed force of the Romans seized him, stript <a id="l244"></a>him of his sacerdotal habit &amp; imprisoned him in a Monastery. But <a id="l245"></a>by assistance of his friends he made his escape &amp; fled into Germany <a id="l246"></a>to Charles the great, &amp; complained of the Romans for acting against <a id="l247"></a>him out of a designe of throwing off all authority of the Church &amp; <a id="l248"></a>recovering their ancient freedom. And in his absence, his accusers <a id="l249"></a>with an armed force ravaged the possessions of the Church &amp; sent <a id="l250"></a>the accusations to  Charles. And before the end of the year <a id="l251"></a>Charles sent the Pope back to Rome with a large retinue. And the <a id="l252"></a>Nobles &amp; Bishops of France who accompanied him examined <a id="l253"></a>the chief of the accusers at Rome, &amp; sent them into France <a id="l254"></a>in custody. This was in the year 799. And the next year <a id="l255"></a>Charles  himself went to Rome &amp; upon a day appointed <a id="l256"></a>presided in a Council of Italian &amp; French Bishops to hear <a id="l257"></a>both parties. <sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup>But when the Popes adversaries expected to be <a id="l258"></a>heard, the Council declared that he who was the supreme <a id="l259"></a>judge of all men, was above being judged by any other then <a id="l260"></a>himself. And thereupon the Pope made a solemn declaration of <a id="l261"></a>his innocence before all the people, &amp; by doing so was looked <a id="l262"></a>upon as acquitted.</p>
<p id="par20"> A few days after when Christmas day was arrived, the people <a id="l263"></a>of Rome who had hitherto elected their Bishop &amp; recconed that <a id="l264"></a>they &amp; their Senate inherited the rights of the ancient Senate <a id="l265"></a>&amp; people of Rome, voted Charles their Emperor &amp; subjected them<a id="l266"></a>selves to him in such manner as the old Roman Empire &amp; their <a id="l267"></a>Senate were subject to the old Roman Emperors. And the Pope <a id="l268"></a>crowned him, &amp; annointed him with holy oyle, &amp; worshipped him <a id="l269"></a>on his knees after the manner of adoring the old Roman Emperors, <a id="l270"></a>as the aforesaid Poet thus mentions.</p>
<div class="lg">
<p class="l">
 Post laudes igitur dictus et summus eundem</p>
<p class="l">Presul adoravit, sicut mos debitus olim</p>
<p class="l">Principus fuit antiquis.</p>
</div>
<p id="par21" class="i0">And the Emperor mutually took the following oath to the Pope. <a id="l271"></a><em class="underline">In nomine Christi spondeo atque polliceor Ego Carolus Imperator <a id="l272"></a>coram Deo et beato Petro Apostolo me protectorem ac defensorem <a id="l273"></a>fore huius Sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ in omnibus utilitatibus qua<a id="l274"></a>tenus divino fultus fuero adjutorio prout sciero poteroque</em>. The <a id="l275"></a>Emperor was also made Consul of Rome &amp; his son Pipin was <a id="l276"></a>crowned king of Italy. And henceforward the Emperor stiled him<a id="l277"></a>self: <em class="underline">Carolus serenissimus Augustus a Deo coronatus, magnus <a id="l278"></a>pacificus, Romæ gubernans Imperium</em>, or <em class="underline">Imperator Romanorum</em>; <a id="l279"></a>&amp; was prayed for in the Churches of Rome; &amp; his image <a id="l280"></a>was henceforward put upon the coins of Rome; &amp; the enemies <a id="l281"></a>of the Pope to the number of 300 Romans, &amp; two or three of <a id="l282"></a>the clergy were sentenced to death; &amp; the  300 Romans <a id="l283"></a>were beheaded in one day in the Lateran fields, but the <a id="l284"></a>Clergy men at the intercession of the Pope were pardoned &amp; <a id="l285"></a>&amp; banished into France. And thus the right of the Roman <a id="l286"></a>Emperors which had hitherto been in the Greek Emperors, <a id="l287"></a>was by this Act translated in the West to the kings of France.</p>
<p id="par22"> After these things<sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> Charles gave the city &amp; Dutchy of <a id="l288"></a>of Rome to the Pope subordinately to himself as Emperor of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> spent the winter in ordering the affairs of Rome &amp; those <a id="l289"></a>of the Apostolick Sea &amp; of all Italy both civil &amp; Ecclesiastical &amp; <a id="l290"></a>in making new laws for them &amp; returned the next summer into <a id="l291"></a>France, leaving the City under its Senate &amp; both under the Pope <a id="l292"></a>&amp; himself. And hearing that his new laws were not observed by <a id="l293"></a>the Iudges in dictating the law, nor by the people in hearing it, <a id="l294"></a>&amp; that the great men took servants from free men &amp; from the <a id="l295"></a>Churches &amp; Monasteries, to labour in their vineyards, fields, pastures, <a id="l296"></a>&amp; houses, &amp; continued to exact cattel &amp; wine of them, &amp; to oppress <a id="l297"></a>those that served the Churches: he wrote to his son Pipin to remedy <a id="l298"></a>these abuses, take care of the Church, &amp; see that his laws be <a id="l299"></a>executed.</p>
<p id="par23">Now the Senate &amp; people &amp; Principality of Rome I take <a id="l300"></a>to be the third King whom the little horn overcame, &amp; even <a id="l301"></a>the chief of the three. For this people elected the Pope &amp; the <a id="l302"></a>Emperor, &amp;  by electing the Emperor &amp; making <a id="l303"></a>him Consul was acknowledged to retain the authority of the <a id="l304"></a>old Roman Senate &amp; people. This City was the Metropolis <a id="l305"></a>of the old Roman Empire represented by the fourth Beast <a id="l306"></a>&amp; by subduing the Senate &amp; people it became the Metropolis <a id="l307"></a>of the little horn of that Beast, &amp; completed Peters Patrimony <a id="l308"></a>which was the kingdome of that horn. And this victory was <a id="l309"></a>attended with greater consequences then these over the other <a id="l310"></a>two kings. For it set up the western Empire which continues <a id="l311"></a>to this day; &amp; it set up the Pope above the judicature of the <a id="l312"></a>Roman Senate &amp; even above all humane judicature, &amp; gave <a id="l313"></a>him the supremacy over the western Churches &amp; their Councils <a id="l314"></a>in a high degree. It gave him a look more stout then his <a id="l315"></a>fellows so that at length when this new religion began to be <a id="l316"></a>established in the minds of men he grappled even with the <a id="l317"></a>western Emperor himself. It is observable also that the  custome of kissing the Popes feet,  <a id="l319"></a>an honour superior to that of kings &amp; Emperors, began about this time. There are some <a id="l320"></a>instances of it in the ninth Century. Platina tells us that the <a id="l321"></a>feet of Pope Leo IV were kissed according to ancient custome by all <a id="l322"></a>that came to him, &amp; some say that Leo III began this custome pretend<a id="l323"></a>ing that his hand was infected by the  kiss of a woman. The Popes <a id="l324"></a>began also about this time to canonize Saints &amp; grant Indulgences <a id="l325"></a>&amp; Pardons; &amp; some represent that Leo III was the first author of all <a id="l326"></a>these things. And it is further observable that Charles the great <a id="l327"></a>between the years 775 &amp; 796 conquered all Germany  <a id="l328"></a>from the Rhene &amp; Danube northward to the Baltic sea &amp; eastward <a id="l329"></a>to the river Teys, &amp; extended his conquests also into Spain as far as <a id="l330"></a>to the river Eber, &amp; by these conquests he laid the foundation of <a id="l331"></a>the new Empire, &amp; at the same time he propagated the Roman <a id="l332"></a>Catholick religion into all his conquests, obliging the Saxons &amp; Hunns <a id="l333"></a>who were heathens to receive the Roman faith, distributing his northern conquests into Bishopricks &amp; granting tyths to the clergy &amp; Peter-<a id="l334"></a>pence to the Pope: by all which the Church of Rome was highly enlarged enriched, <a id="l335"></a> exalted, &amp; established.</p>
<p id="par24"><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup>In a small book printed at Paris 1689, &amp; entituled: <em class="underline">An his<a id="l336"></a>torical dissertation upon some coins of Charles the great, Ludovicus <a id="l337"></a>Pius</em>, Lotharius &amp; their successors stamped at Rome there is a draught <a id="l338"></a>of a piece of Mosaic work  which Pope Leo III caused <a id="l339"></a>to be made in his Palace neare the Church of Iohn Lateran, in <a id="l340"></a>memory of his sending the standard or banner of the city of Rome <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> curiously wrought to Charles the great, &amp; which still <a id="l341"></a>remained there at the publishing  of the said book. <a id="l342"></a>In the Mosaic work there appeared Peter with three keys in his <a id="l343"></a>lap, reaching the Pallium to the Pope with his right hand, <a id="l344"></a>&amp; the banner of the city to Charles the great with his left. <a id="l345"></a>By the Pope is this inscription SCISSIMVS D. N.  LEO PP; <a id="l346"></a>by the King this D. N. CARVLO REGI; &amp; under the feet of <a id="l347"></a>Peter this, BEATE PETRE DONA VITAM LEONI PP, <a id="l348"></a>ET VICTORIAM CARVLO REGI DONA.  The meaning <a id="l349"></a>seems to be that in this attempt S. Peter would preserve the <a id="l350"></a>life of the Pope &amp; give victory to the king. For by the inscription <a id="l351"></a>it appears that this piece of mosaic work was made before <a id="l352"></a>Charles was Emperor, suppose in the year 800  before the Counsel met to heare the cause of the Pope. <a id="l353"></a>The three keys in the lap of Peter  signify the keys of the <a id="l354"></a>three parts of his patrimony, viz<sup>t</sup> that of Rome with its Dutchy <a id="l355"></a>which he was conquering, &amp; those of Ravenna with the Exarchate <a id="l356"></a>&amp; of the territories taken from the Lombards both which he had <a id="l357"></a>newly conquered. These were the three Dominions whose keys <a id="l358"></a>were in the lap of Peter &amp; whose crowns are now worn by <a id="l359"></a>the Pope, &amp; by the conquest of which he became the little horn <a id="l360"></a>of the fourth Beast. By Peters giving the Pallium to the <a id="l361"></a>Pope with his right hand &amp; the Banner of the city to the <a id="l362"></a>king with his left &amp; by  naming the Pope before <a id="l363"></a>the king in the inscription, may be understood, that the Pope <a id="l364"></a>was then recconed superior in dignity to the kings of the earth.</p>
<p id="par25">After the death of Charles the great, his son &amp; successor <a id="l365"></a>Ludovicus Pius at the request of the Pope <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> confirmed the donations of <a id="l366"></a>his grandfather &amp; father to the sea of Rome. And in this con<a id="l367"></a>firmation he names first Rome with its Dutchy extending into <a id="l368"></a>Tuscia &amp; Campania, then the Exarchate of Ravenna with <a id="l369"></a>Pentapolis, &amp; in the third place the territories taken from the <a id="l370"></a>Lombards. These are his three conquests &amp; he was to hold <a id="l371"></a>them of the Emperor for the use of the Church <em class="underline">sub integritate</em> <a id="l372"></a>entirely without the Emperors medling therewith or with the <a id="l373"></a>jurisdiction or power of the Pope therein unless called thereunto <a id="l374"></a>in certain cases. This ratification the Emperor made in writing <a id="l375"></a>under an oath. And as the king of the Ostrogoths for acknowledging <a id="l376"></a>that he held his kingdom of Italy of the Greek Emperor, stamped <a id="l377"></a>the Emperors effigies on one side of his coins &amp; his own on the <a id="l378"></a>Reverse: so the Pope made the like acknowledgment to  the western <a id="l379"></a>Emperor. For the Pope began now to coin money, &amp; the coins <a id="l380"></a>of Rome are henceforward found with the head of the Emperors <a id="l381"></a>(Charles, Ludovicus Pius, Lotharius, &amp; their successors), on one side, <a id="l382"></a>&amp; the Popes inscription on the Reverse for many years.</p>
