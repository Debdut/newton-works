<p id="par1">Now it is to be conceived that the mystery of iniquity which consisted in these heresies <a id="l1"></a>&amp; began to work in the Apostles days, worked more &amp; more <a id="l2"></a>till  it brake in upon the Church &amp; caused that <a id="l3"></a>Christian religion was purest in the first age of Christianity &amp; de<a id="l4"></a>cayed gradually till the man of sin was revealed. [And since the <a id="l5"></a>Man of Sin  opposed &amp; exalted himself above every thing that is <a id="l6"></a>called God or that is worshipped we may conclude that he was under <a id="l7"></a>no temporal  power but reigned  by the sword  The Christian religion was set up against <a id="l14"></a>the power of the sword, the  Antichristian by the <a id="l15"></a>power of the sword. The Christian maintained one God &amp; one Lord <a id="l16"></a>against all the Gods of the heathens &amp;  hereticks &amp; was propagated <a id="l17"></a> against the religion of the Empire by poor men preaching the <a id="l19"></a>gospel under all temporal discouragements to the hazzard &amp; sometimes <a id="l20"></a>to the loss of their lives: the Antichristian was a branch of the heathen <a id="l21"></a>religion owning many Gods according to the Theology of the heathens <a id="l22"></a>&amp; making Christ to be one of them &amp; worked in vitious men in <a id="l23"></a>opposition to the Christian untill it  gained the power of the sword &amp; thereby <a id="l24"></a>exalted it self above every thing that is called God or that is wor<a id="l25"></a>shipped.  This power of the sword it could not have while the heathen <a id="l26"></a>empire stood,  but yet worked &amp; encreased in strength  <a id="l27"></a>under this Empire that when that which letted should be taken <a id="l28"></a>out of the way it might be  able to gain this power.]  <a id="l29"></a>Let us therefore now see by what steps this mystery of  iniquity <a id="l30"></a>grew up untill it gained the dominion, [&amp; the Christian religion <a id="l31"></a>at the same time decreased in vertue]  For the first times of Christianity may be distinguished into the  four following states,  the <a id="l33"></a>first  in which the Christian religion was in its purity &amp; <a id="l34"></a>heresies were kept under by  Apostolick authority, the second  <a id="l35"></a>in which  heresies multiplied &amp; gained many followers but without breaking <a id="l36"></a>in upon the Church, the third  in which they were refined  &amp; began to  insinuate themselves into <a id="l37"></a>the Church &amp;  the fourth in which <a id="l38"></a>they began to  divide the Church against her self.</p>
<p id="par2">The  Church continued in the first of these four states <a id="l39"></a>till the reign of Trajan &amp; <span class="hspac-n" title="Space left blank."></span>. For Iohn the Apostle lived till the 2<sup>d</sup> <a id="l40"></a>or 3<sup>d</sup> year of his reign  &amp; Symeon the  son of Cleopas a disciple &amp; kinsman of Christ &amp; bishop of Ierusalem  was martyred about the middle of  his <a id="l42"></a>reign being 120 years old.  And Hegesippus who was contemporary to Polycarp the disciple of <a id="l43"></a>Iohn  mentioning the death of Symeon, subjoyns Ecclesiam ad hæc usque <a id="l44"></a>tempora instar cujusdam virginis integram atque incorruptam permansisse . . . . . . . . obtrudere aggressi <a id="l45"></a>sunt. Euseb. Eccl. Hist. l. 3. c. 32.  Et Ecclesiam quidem hactenus <a id="l46"></a>virginem vocabant propterea quod vanis sermonibus nondum corruptam <a id="l47"></a>fuerat. Hegesippus apud Euseb. Hist. Eccl. l 4. c. 22. ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 77v &gt; </span>  circumcision.</p> 
<p id="par3">✝ The Gnosticks began to rise up before the destruction of Ierusalem <a id="l50"></a>for in oppsition to them the Apostle Paul advises to avoid  profane &amp; old wives fables &amp; <a id="l51"></a>endless genealogies &amp; oppositions of science falsly so called, that is the fables of the ancient Poets which were profane &amp; foolish &amp; the genealogies of  <a id="l52"></a>Gods which were endless &amp;  disputes about the metaphy<a id="l53"></a>sical philosophy of the heathens  which was false. Some reccon Simon  others <a id="l54"></a> Nicolaus the first author of the Gnosticks.  Simon made some <a id="l55"></a>Genealogies, Nicolaus &amp; others might encrease their number &amp; give occasion to <a id="l56"></a>the Apostle to call them endless. After these flourished Ebion Cerinthus &amp; Menander <a id="l57"></a>but all their heresies being checkt by the authority of the Apostles were of <a id="l58"></a>small extent &amp; short continuance. And concerning the Ebionites &amp; Nazarenes its observable that the Christians of the  Church of Ierusalem – – – – – – Churches <a id="l59"></a>of the circumcision. And the Church of Ierusalem was of the circumcision &amp; had bishops <a id="l60"></a>of the circumcision till the 18<sup>th</sup> year of Adrian A.C. 135 when all Iews were forbidden the city.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 77r resumes &gt; </span> And its observable <a id="l61"></a>that the Christians of the Church of Ierusalem in this age were all <a id="l62"></a>zealous of the law (Act. 21.20) Gal. 2.12, 13. &amp; the churches of the uncircumcision were by  the Iews  called the sect of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p077v"> &lt;77v&gt; </span> the Nazarenes <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>(Acts<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> 24.5) &amp; when the dispersion of this Church by the <a id="l63"></a>wars of the Romans was at hand Matthew wrote his Gospel in hebrew for <a id="l64"></a>the sake of these Christians,  &amp; therefore I do not reccon them <a id="l65"></a>amongst the hereticks. They were all circumcised &amp; by circumcision had <a id="l66"></a>covenanted with God to keep the law &amp; it was no crime to keep their <a id="l67"></a>covenant for the law was good. (Rom. 7.7, 12. Gal. 5.3) But to impose the law upon the gentiles as <a id="l68"></a>necessary to salvation, made void the faith  in Christ, &amp; this was the crime <a id="l69"></a>of the Ebionites. There were Apostles of the circumcision &amp; Apostles of the <a id="l70"></a>uncircumcision &amp; the Nazarenes were the Churches of the circumcision.</p> 
<p id="par4">The second state or age of the Church lasted till the  reign of <a id="l71"></a>Severus, Victor being bishop of Rome, ffor in this interval of time the Gnosticks <a id="l72"></a>flourished Saturninus, Basilides, Carpocrates, Valentinus, Secundus Ptolmæus <a id="l73"></a>Marcus Colarbasus Heracleon, Cerdon, Marcion, Apelles, Tatian, &amp; <a id="l74"></a> after them arose Montanus &amp; his weomen Prisca &amp; <a id="l75"></a>Maximilla.  But the Church notwithstanding these heresies continued entire <a id="l76"></a>till the days of Victor. For Irenæus who wrote against heresies in the days <a id="l77"></a>of Eleutherus the predecessor of Victor – – – – heard above. And Hegesippus who <a id="l78"></a> wrote  in the days of the same Eleutherus tells us – – – taught by our Lord.</p> 
<p id="par5">After the reign of Trajan rose up a multitude of eminent Gnosticks <a id="l79"></a>Saturninus, Basilides, Carpocrates, Valentinus, Secundus, Ptolomæus, Marcus, Colar<a id="l80"></a>basus, Heracleon, Cerdon,  Marcion, Apelles, Tatian. All these rose up <a id="l81"></a>in the days of Polycarp the disciple of Iohn the Apostle, who was martyred <a id="l82"></a>A.C. 169 &amp; about the time of his death rose up Montanus with his weomen <a id="l83"></a>Prisca &amp; Maximilla whose heresy being a more refined sort of Gnosticism then <a id="l84"></a>any of the former spread much faster &amp; within the space of twenty or thirty years <a id="l85"></a>insinuated it self into the Church of Rome, Pope Victor or his succcessor Zepherinus in   the reign of the Emperor Severus becoming a Montanist. And therefore <a id="l87"></a>I end the second age of the Church with the  beginning of <a id="l88"></a>his reign. </p>
<p id="par6" class="i0"> The Christians of chief note who <a id="l91"></a>instructed the Churches &amp; defended them against heresies in this age were Polycarp <a id="l92"></a>bishop of Smyrna, Melito bishop of  Sardica, Theophilus Bishop <a id="l93"></a>of Antioch, Apollinaris bishop of Hierapolis, Dionysius bishop of Corinth, <a id="l94"></a>Pinytus bishop of Crete.

And the crime was as great <a id="l131"></a>if the converted Gentiles refused to communicate with the converted Iews unless <a id="l132"></a>they became uncircumcised.  They were to converse  with one another &amp; be of one communion &amp; one Church &amp; might intermarry. And the children of a Iew &amp; of a Gentile were at liberty either to remain <a id="l134"></a>uncircumcised or to become circumcised, as in the case of Timothy,  &amp; had <a id="l135"></a>reason to chuse  uncircumcision for avoiding the burden of  observing the law. <a id="l136"></a> And this was the state of the <a id="l137"></a>primitive Church Catholic in relation to the Churches of the circumcision &amp; <a id="l138"></a>uncircumcision of which she was composed during her virgin age &amp; for some time <a id="l139"></a>longer. ffor the Churches of the circumcision being dispersed by the wars of the <a id="l140"></a>Romans &amp; intermixing with the Churches of the uncircumcision by marriages &amp; in such cases not circumcising their children were but <a id="l141"></a>of short continuance.</p>

And hence came the Creeds, these being the forms <a id="l318"></a>of words in which they instructed new Christians in order to <a id="l319"></a>baptism &amp; for handing down the true faith to all posterity.

The <a id="l373"></a>new converts were first instructed in the principles of religion with<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p081r"> &lt;81r&gt; </span>out the Creed, then they were taught the Creed by memory as <a id="l374"></a> a summary of their faith,  &amp; at baptism they repeated <a id="l375"></a>it by memory as a profession of the faith into which they were <a id="l376"></a>baptized.  After this manner they handed down the Creed by oral or unwritten <a id="l377"></a>tradition  <a id="l379"></a>obliging every man to learn it before he was baptised. And this <a id="l380"></a>I take to be the only unwritten tradition of the  faith.</p>
<p id="par25">Tertullian tells us<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> the rule of faith (so he calls the Creed) had <a id="l381"></a> descended down from the beginning <a id="l382"></a>of the gospel. And Irenæus   affirms the same <a id="l386"></a>&amp; sets down the substance of the Creed in this <a id="l387"></a>manner. The Church altho dispersed throughout the whole <a id="l388"></a>world to the ends of the earth,  keeps that faith which was received <a id="l389"></a>from the Apostles &amp; their disciples which is, In one God the <a id="l390"></a>father Almighty, who made the heaven &amp; earth &amp; sea &amp; <a id="l391"></a>all things in them, &amp; in one Iesus Christ the son of God incar<a id="l392"></a>nate for our salvation, &amp; in the Holy Ghost who by the <a id="l393"></a>Prophets preached the disensations of God &amp; the coming of Iesus <a id="l394"></a>Christ our beloved Lord &amp; his birth of the Virgin &amp; passion <a id="l395"></a>&amp; resurrection from the dead &amp; ascent into heaven with <a id="l396"></a>his flesh &amp;his coming from heaven to restore  all things &amp; <a id="l397"></a>to raise from death to life all the flesh of  all mankind that <a id="l398"></a>every knee  of things  celestial terrestrial <a id="l399"></a>&amp; infernal may bow to Christ Iesus our Lord &amp; God &amp; <a id="l400"></a>Saviour &amp; King according to the good will &amp; pleasure <a id="l401"></a>of the invisible father, &amp; every tongue may confess to him <a id="l402"></a>&amp; he may give just judgment in all things, &amp; send  the  <a id="l403"></a>spiritual beings which are wicked &amp; the  Angels who transgressed <a id="l404"></a>&amp;  fell &amp; the ungodly &amp; unjust &amp; lawless &amp; blasphemous <a id="l405"></a>men,  into eternal fire; &amp;  giving life unto the just &amp; holy <a id="l406"></a>&amp; those who keep his commandments &amp;  who <a id="l407"></a>either from the beginning or after repentance remain  in <a id="l408"></a>his love,  may make <a id="l409"></a>them incorruptible &amp; compass them with glory. This preaching <a id="l410"></a>&amp; faith, being received as I said above, the Church altho dispersed <a id="l411"></a>throughout the whole world keeps carefully as if she inhabited <a id="l412"></a>but one house &amp; beleives these things even as if she had but <a id="l413"></a>one soul &amp; one &amp; the same heart, &amp; with one voice prea<a id="l414"></a>ches &amp; teaches &amp; delivers these things as if she had but one <a id="l415"></a>mouth. For altho there be various languages in the world <a id="l416"></a>yet the power of the tradition is one &amp; the same. Neither <a id="l417"></a>do the Churches seated in Germany beleive otherwise or deliver <a id="l418"></a>otherwise nor those which are in Spain or in France or in the East <a id="l419"></a>or in Egypt or in Afric or in the middle  of the world. But as <a id="l420"></a>the sun created by God is one &amp; the same in the whole world, so <a id="l421"></a>the preaching of the truth shines every where &amp; illuminates all <a id="l422"></a>men who are willing to come to the knowledge of the truth. Neither <a id="l423"></a>doth any man very prevalent in speech amongst those who preside in <a id="l424"></a>the Church, speak other things then these, for no man is above <a id="l425"></a>his master. Nor does he that is weak in speech diminish the tradition<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p081v"> &lt;81v&gt; </span> ffor the faith being one &amp; the same, neither does he who can <a id="l426"></a>speak much of it enlarge it, neither does he who can speak <a id="l427"></a>but little diminish it. Thus far Irenæus concerning the Creed <a id="l428"></a>framed by the Apostles &amp; delivered down  by universal tradition from the <a id="l429"></a>beginning of the gospel it  conteining that one faith by which &amp; baptism all Christians were admitted into the Church Cath. from the beginning. For if  it had not been from the <a id="l430"></a>beginning of the gospel it could not have been  universal.  Polycarp was the disciple of Iohn the Apostle &amp; had conversed with others also who had seen the Lord &amp; Irenæus was the disciple of Polycarp, &amp; therefore in reciting the  primitive Creed &amp; telling us that it was received from the Apostles &amp; their disciples,  deserves to be credited. <a id="l431"></a>It contains the whole faith.  into which Christians were baptized from the be<a id="l433"></a>ginning  &amp; therefore was from the beginning In order to their being baptized &amp; <a id="l434"></a>thereby admitted into the Church Catholick they were to <a id="l435"></a>beleive nothing more  or less then the articles of this <a id="l436"></a>Creed. They were not obliged to beleive  the infalli<a id="l437"></a>bility or supremacy of the Pope nor  the authority of the <a id="l438"></a>Church or Councils.

<p id="par26">When Christ rose from the dead he conversed with his disci<a id="l449"></a>ples 40 days<sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> &amp; explained to them the scriptures  saying unto them <a id="l451"></a><em class="underline">O fools &amp; slow of heart to beleive all that the Prophets have <a id="l452"></a>spoken!

<p id="par27">Yet  the order of the articles <a id="l490"></a>was not the same in all the Churches as may be seen in the Creed of the  Church of Rome usually called the Apostles <a id="l491"></a>&amp; in that established by the Council of Constantinople: which runs thus.</p>

<p id="par30">In These  two Creeds,  the  Articles which  are conteined within the brackets,  were <a id="l517"></a>inserted in the fourth Century, &amp; if they be omitted, the Creeds agree with one another <a id="l518"></a>&amp; with the Creed set down by Irenæus &amp; by their agreement confirm <a id="l519"></a>one another to be the true universal tradition of faith during the three <a id="l520"></a>first centuries.</p>
<p id="par31">There is extant a fourth Creed recited &amp; commented on in the middle of the 4<sup>th</sup> century <a id="l521"></a>by Cyrillus bishop of Ierusalem. It runs thus. I beleive in one God the father <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p082v"> &lt;82v&gt; </span> Almighty maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp; of all things visible &amp; invisible. <a id="l522"></a>And in one Lord Iesus Christ the only begotten son of God [begotten of <a id="l523"></a>his father before all worlds, the true God, by whom all things were made] <a id="l524"></a>who was incarnate &amp; made man, crucified &amp; buried, rose again from the dead the third day &amp; ascended into heaven &amp; sitteth at the right <a id="l525"></a>hand of the father &amp; shall come to judge the quick &amp; the dead, of <a id="l526"></a>whose kingdom there shall be no end. And in the Holy Ghost the comforter <a id="l527"></a>who spake by the Prophets, [&amp; in one holy Catholick Church] &amp; in the re<a id="l528"></a>surrection of the flesh &amp; in life everlasting</p>
<p id="par32">The Creed of the Church at Hippo in Afric set down by Austin <a id="l529"></a>Bishop of that city is the same with the Roman above men<a id="l530"></a>tioned except that the descent into Hell the Communion of saints <a id="l531"></a>&amp; life everlasting are omitted. And Tertullian in his book de Virginibus <a id="l532"></a>velandis recites the same Creed in these words. Regula quidem fidei una <a id="l533"></a>omnino est, sola immobilis &amp; irreformabilis, credendi scilicet in <a id="l534"></a>unicum Deum, mundi conditorem, &amp; filium ejus Iesum Christum <a id="l535"></a>natum ex virgine Maria, crucifixum sub Pontio Pilato, tertia die <a id="l536"></a>resuscitatum a mortuis, receptum in cælis, sedentem nunc ad dexteram <a id="l537"></a>Patris, venturum judicare vivos &amp; mortuos per carnis etiam re<a id="l538"></a>surrectionem. He omits here the article of beleiving in the Holy Ghost <a id="l539"></a>but adds it in his book de præscriptione Hæreticorum where he para<a id="l540"></a>phrases the Creed in this manner. Credimus unum omnino Deum esse <a id="l541"></a>nec alium præter mundi conditorem qui universa de nihilo produxe<a id="l542"></a>rit per Verbum suum primo omnium demissum: Id Verbum filium <a id="l543"></a>ejus appeallatum, in nomine Dei varie visum a Patriarchis, in Prophetis <a id="l544"></a>semper auditum, postremo delatum ex spiritu patris Dei et virtute in <a id="l545"></a>Virginem Mariam, carnem factum in utero ejus, &amp; ex ea natum <a id="l546"></a>egisse Iesum Christum, exinde prædicasse novam legem &amp; novam <a id="l547"></a>promissionem regni cælorum, virtutes fecisse, fixum cruci, tertia <a id="l548"></a>die resurrexisse, in cœos ereptum sedisse ad dexteram patris, misisse <a id="l549"></a>vicariam vim spiritus sancti qui credentes agat, venturum cum clari<a id="l550"></a>tate ad sumendos sanctos in vitæ æternæ &amp; promissorum cælestium <a id="l551"></a>fructum et ad profanos adjudicandos igni perpetuo, facta utriusque <a id="l552"></a>partis resuscitatione cum carnis restitutione. Hæc regula a <a id="l553"></a>Christo  instituta nullas habet apud nos quæstiones nisi <a id="l554"></a>quas hæreses inferunt &amp; quæ hæreticos faciunt. Thus far Ter<a id="l555"></a>tullian. Now by comparing all these Creeds together it is easy to <a id="l556"></a>see what were the primitive Articles of the  Creed &amp; in what <a id="l557"></a>sence they were to be understood.</p> 
<p id="par33">Hitherto the  Church  throughout the whole world continued <a id="l558"></a>united in one faith &amp; the Creed  was every where one &amp; the same as to the sense <a id="l559"></a>&amp; substance of it no dispute arising between the Churches about it: but in the fourth Century new Articles began to be in<a id="l560"></a>serted. And first Alexander Bishop of Alexandria in making a  declaration of his faith in<a id="l561"></a>serted the Catholick &amp; Apostolick Church in this manner.

I suppose they meant in the sense that they feigned Hellena to be Ennoia I suppose they meant in the same sense that they feigned Hellena to be Ennoia, that is, by a Pythagorick metmpsychosis,  Yet Simon <a id="l591"></a> Yet Simon said that he only appeared as a man in Iudæ &amp; did not really suffer  upon the cross when <a id="l592"></a>he was thought to suffer.    <a id="l595"></a>He said also  that the Prophets were inspired by Angels his enemies &amp; therefore <a id="l596"></a> to be rejected, &amp; that men were to be saved (he meant from the Angels <a id="l597"></a>) not by just works but only by faith in him &amp; Helena &amp; therefore might <a id="l598"></a>do what they pleased.  Whence his Priests lived in lust &amp; used exorcisms <a id="l599"></a>&amp; incantations &amp;  magical arts &amp; philters  &amp; things inciting weomen to lust, &amp; fictions of familiar spirits  &amp; of prophetick dreams, &amp; worshipped the images of Simon &amp; Helena <a id="l602"></a>in the form of Iuppiter &amp; Minerva, And in their assemblies had filthy mysteries <a id="l603"></a>instituted by Simon, which consisted in offering to their Gods the seminal profluvia of men <a id="l604"></a>&amp; menstrua of weomen instead of the Eucharist. And this was the philosophy <a id="l605"></a>&amp; practice of the Simonians &amp; the  original of science falsly so called <a id="l606"></a>rom whence the Gnosticks had their name.

Vpon the siege of Ierusalem They &amp; the Nazarenes are said to have <a id="l804"></a>fled from  Peræa &amp; chiefly to Pella <a id="l805"></a> &amp; from thence to have spread <a id="l806"></a>their heresies. Whence I gather that they were originally <a id="l807"></a>of the Church of Iames,  &amp; by   consequence were  called Nazarenes by the unconverted <a id="l808"></a>Iews,  that name being given by  those Iews to all  them of the circumcision who owened Iesus of Nazareth to be the Messiah.  But the <a id="l810"></a>name of Ebionites  whether it was taken <a id="l811"></a>from a man called Ebion  the supposed author of a sect, or from the <a id="l812"></a>poverty of the beleiving Iews in Peræa, seems not to have been so general, <a id="l813"></a>nor so ancient. And whilst the  beleiving Iews of those parts gloried in the name of poor people <a id="l814"></a>that is (in the Iewish language) in the name of Ebionits,  we need not wonder  if the best Christians of <a id="l817"></a>those parts who beleived Iesus to be the son of God, called themselves poor people or    Ebionites, while the worst who  beleived him to be the son of Ioseph recom<a id="l818"></a>mended themselves by that name so as at length to make it the <a id="l819"></a>name of a heresy.    But whatever be the original &amp; signification of that <a id="l823"></a>name it is manifest that  there were <a id="l824"></a>churches of the circumcision  who agreed with the churches <a id="l825"></a>of the uncircumcision from the  days of the Apostles in teaching that <a id="l826"></a>in the beginning there was a Spirit,  by whom all things were <a id="l827"></a>created &amp; who was above the Angels &amp; reigned over all things &amp; <a id="l828"></a>appeared to the Patriarchs &amp; to Moses &amp; came down from heaven <a id="l829"></a>&amp; took flesh of the virgin &amp; became a man the son of God &amp; <a id="l830"></a>not of Ioseph, &amp; was crucified &amp; rose from the dead &amp; ascended <a id="l831"></a>whilst others taught that  that Christ descended upon Iesus the son of Ioseph. And for <a id="l833"></a>distinguishing these two sorts of Christian Iews from one another  I will for the future call <a id="l834"></a> the first Nazarenes &amp; the second Ebionites. ffor I know <a id="l835"></a>of no other difference between them in point of faith. They  both <a id="l836"></a>observed the law themselves, but the Ebionites imposed the law upon the Gentiles <a id="l837"></a>&amp; on that account were vain schismaticks in respect of the Gentiles. The Ebionites also <a id="l838"></a>absteined from eating flesh &amp;  some things endued with life, &amp; in the Eucharist <a id="l839"></a>used water alone instead of wine. Which Customes might arise from their <a id="l840"></a>poverty. But the  chief difference is that the Nazarenes  owned Christ <a id="l841"></a>to be the son of God born of the Virgin, &amp; that he was crucified &amp; rose <a id="l842"></a>again &amp; the Ebionites said that Christ was  not born  nor suffered but descended upon Iesus  who was  only the son of Ioseph &amp; suffered alone.</p>

<p id="par54">Neither would the ancient hereticks who taught that the λογος came <a id="l969"></a>not in the flesh but only dwelt in   Iesus as a holy spirit <a id="l970"></a>in a good man, have been much offended at the hypostatic union of the <a id="l971"></a>two natures each remaining distinct with its own substance will &amp; understanding, &amp; the <a id="l972"></a>λόγος not being  subject to the infirmities of the flesh nor feeling <a id="l973"></a>the pains of death upon the cross.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p087v"> &lt;87v&gt; </span>
<p id="par55" class="i0">or the son for the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος of the father, &amp; his generation for an <a id="l974"></a> act whereby God  emitted him outwardly not from all eternity but in the beginning of the creation  as the principle by which he would create the world, &amp; accounted the <a id="l976"></a>Holy Ghost ἀπό᾽ρρ῾οιαν an efflux emission  or emanation  of the substance of God as light is <a id="l977"></a>of the sun.</p>
<p id="par56">And of the same opinion was  his contemporary Theophilus bishop of Antioch <a id="l978"></a>ffor Theophilus in his second book to Autolicus  writes thus, Εχων ὀυν ὁ θεος</p>

<p id="par58">For Tatian made the  Word to subsist in God from all eternity <a id="l979"></a>&amp;  at length to emerge out of him by his will,  not an empty emission   but the <a id="l980"></a>first begotten work of his spirit, born of him  not by <a id="l981"></a>avulsion but by division only without diminution of the father. ffor as <a id="l982"></a>at one lamp many other lamps may be kindled without diminishing the <a id="l983"></a>light of the first lamp, so the Word coming out from the power of the <a id="l984"></a>father did not make his father ἄλογον void of reason &amp; understanding. <a id="l985"></a>And This was the </p>
<p id="par59">Tatian &amp; his followers the Encratites seem to have held much the<a id="l986"></a>same opinion about the Son,  [&amp; by their appearance of sanctity <a id="l987"></a>to have contributed much to the spreading of this opinion.] ffor he <a id="l988"></a>made the Word</p>
<p id="par60">So also Clemens Alexandrinus a great admirer of Plato, made the Word to <a id="l989"></a>be the omnipotent power &amp; wisdom &amp; Idea of the father &amp; at length to come out of him for  effecting the creation &amp; afterwards to have begot himself when the  Word became flesh so as to <a id="l991"></a>be visible</p>
<p id="par61">By these instances it is manifest that Platonism began to spread much in the <a id="l992"></a>Churches before the end of the second century. And therefore we need not wonder if it pre<a id="l993"></a>vailed in the fourth. By the condemnation of Paul of Samosat in the middle of the third it met with some check especially in the east: but yet spread silently. Athanasius declares frequently in his works that the son was the λογος ἐνδιάθετος  of the father without which the father would <a id="l995"></a>be ἄσοφος &amp; ἄλογος &amp;  that he arose from the father as light from the sun <a id="l996"></a>a river from the fountain &amp; a tree from the root. And Alexander of Alexandria <a id="l997"></a>in his general Epistle directed &amp; sent to   all the bishops of the Church catholick in <a id="l998"></a>the beginning of  controversy with Arius  &amp; subscribed by all those of his party, writes thus. <a id="l999"></a>Quid si filius ratio Patris est ac sapientia, quomodo fuit tempus cum non <a id="l1000"></a>esset? Perinde  enim est ac si dicerent  ἄλογον καὶ ἄσοφον ποτὲ τὸν Θεόν, Deum <a id="l1002"></a>aliquando rationis &amp; sapientiæ expertem fuisse. This being subscribed by all the party may be taken for their common opinion. And Constantine the <a id="l1003"></a>great &amp; his party were of the same opinion. For in an Epistle which he  composed against Arius &amp; sent to the Church of Alexandria  before the meeting of the Council of Nice &amp; which (according to Epiphanius &amp; <a id="l1005"></a>Socrates) was  published in all the cities of the Roman Empire  speaks thus to Arius. Verum Dicis <a id="l1006"></a>Deum: habes ejusdem me sententiæ. Sic igitur sentias. Ejus essentiæ Verbum &amp; <a id="l1007"></a>pricnipij et finis expers, Verbum esse dicis: Eo contentus sum; ita crede. Siquid <a id="l1008"></a>præterea adjungis, id tollo. Siquid ad impiam separationem fraudulenter consuis <a id="l1009"></a>id nec videre nec intelligere me confiteor. Si hospitium corporis assumis ad <a id="l1010"></a>divinorum operum dispensationem, non improbo.  And the bishops of Egypt &amp; the <a id="l1011"></a>west convened soon after at Serdica say in their general Epistle Confite<a id="l1012"></a>mur filium esse virtutem patris. Confitemur illum esse Verbum Dei Patris præter <a id="l1013"></a>quod nullum est aliud: et Verbum verum Deum et sapientiam et virtutem esse <a id="l1014"></a>Verum autem filium esse tradimus non sicut alij Filij appellantur. Nam hi quidem aut rege<a id="l1015"></a>nerationis causa Dij dicuntur, aut eo quod digni habiti fuerint Filij noncupantur: non autem <a id="l1016"></a>ob unam ὑπώστασιν substantiam quæ est Patris et Filij. This was in those days the opinion <a id="l1017"></a>of the Bishops of the West. For ὑπωστασις was then  taken  in the same sense with ουσια, the <a id="l1018"></a>language of one υσια &amp; the ὑπωστασεις being not yet established. And these things shew that the <a id="l1019"></a>opinion of the sons being the λογος ἐνδιαθετος of the father was in those days  spread very much in <a id="l1020"></a>the whole empire.</p> 
<p id="par62">The words of Tertullian run thus, <sup class="note" id="n36-ref">[36]</sup>Nam idem [Praxeam]  <a id="l1021"></a>Episcopum Romanum, agnoscentem jam prophetias Montani <a id="l1022"></a>Priscæ Maximillæ et ex ea agnitione pacem Ecclesijs Asiæ <a id="l1023"></a>et Phrygiæ inferentem, falsa de ipsis Prophetijs et Ecclesijs <a id="l1024"></a>adseverando, &amp; præcessorum ejus auctoritates defendendo, coegit <a id="l1025"></a>et literas pacis revocare jam emissas, et a proposito reci<a id="l1026"></a>piendorum charismatum concessare ita duo negotia diaboli <a id="l1027"></a>Praxeas Romæ procuravit; prophetiam expulit, &amp; hæresin <a id="l1028"></a>intulit; Paracletum fugavit et Patrem crucifixit.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p088r"> &lt;88r&gt; </span>

<p id="par64">For The  Gnosticks like the  Heathens &amp; Cabbalists derived <a id="l1029"></a>many emissions or Æons male &amp; female successively from the first God by generation  <a id="l1030"></a>&amp; Archangels &amp; Angels from these Æons &amp; the world not from the first God but either from the <a id="l1031"></a>Angels or from one or more of the Æons.  <a id="l1032"></a>And the first God  whom they called the unknown father the <a id="l1033"></a>unbegotten God, Propator, Proarch Bythos &amp; Abraxas, they placed in the eight or highest <a id="l1034"></a>heaven together with his wife whom they called Ennœa,  Prunicus Barbelo  Ataris &amp; Sige, &amp; in the <a id="l1035"></a>seven inferior Orbs they placed seven  chief Æons with <a id="l1036"></a>Angels under them &amp; the world under them &amp; called the first of those Æons Αρχή, Nous,  Pater, <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Hang, Cyn<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Ialdabaoth<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; the second Λόγος, &amp; Iao &amp; by other names And hence came their Ogdoas of Æons.  And some added <a id="l1037"></a>a Decas of Æons answering to the number of the nations which God promised to give to Abraham for a possession &amp; a Dodecas of Æons answering to <a id="l1038"></a>the twelve signes. All which made up 30 Æons answering to the  number of <a id="l1039"></a>days in the month &amp; of years in the age of Christ before he was baptized <a id="l1040"></a>&amp; began to act. And some increased the number of Æons to that of days <a id="l1041"></a>in the year. This was the Philosophy of Simon, Nicolaus, Menander,  <a id="l1042"></a>Saturninus, Basilides, Carpocras, Valentinus, Epiphanes, Secundus, Ptolo<a id="l1043"></a>mæus, Marcus, Colarbasus, Heracleon, Tation &amp; the Canaites Ophites Sethians <a id="l1044"></a>Borbelites,  Phibeonites, Militaries &amp;c, tho not without variety <a id="l1045"></a>of opinions. Simon began with the Ogdoas of Æons &amp; Angels &amp; the <a id="l1046"></a>creation of the world by the Angels, &amp; others added to his inventions. <a id="l1047"></a>  <a id="l1048"></a>Simon said that the first God appeared on  mount Sina &amp; in  <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Samaria<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> as the father, In Iudea as the son &amp; in other nations as the holy Ghost &amp; making Pythagoric transmigration of souls said that he himself ( that is his soul) was the first God &amp; his  concubine <a id="l1049"></a>Helena was Minerva  &amp; accordingly his followers erected statues to him &amp; his <a id="l1050"></a>concubine in the form of Iupiter &amp; Minerva &amp; worshipped them  And By this <a id="l1051"></a>worship, &amp; the male &amp; female Gods &amp; Pythagoric transmigrations   &amp;  placing Æons in the Orbs of the Planets &amp; deriving all things from the substance &amp; power of the first God  you may know that <a id="l1052"></a>he borrowed  the main of his philosophy from the Poetry Philosophy  &amp; Astrology of the heathens.</p>
<p id="par65">These hereticks pretending to learning &amp; science [&amp; introducing the <a id="l1053"></a> philosophical opinions of the heathens &amp; Cabbalists into the  Christian religion] <a id="l1054"></a>were thence called Gnosticks. And their Æons had – – – – – – affinity with <a id="l1055"></a>the Iewish Cabbala.</p>

<p id="par67">For the first emission of Proarche &amp; Borbelo was by the Nicolaitans <a id="l1056"></a>&amp; Cerinthus &amp; Basilides called Αρχὴ &amp; the second Λόγοσ &amp; the third (by Basilides) <a id="l1057"></a>Enthymasis: &amp; these were the first  sephiroths of the Cabbalists. Their Æn Soph Infinite was the <a id="l1058"></a>first God called by some of the  Gnosticks Bythos &amp; Megethos, Abyss <a id="l1059"></a>&amp; Magnitude, meaning without bounds. Their first sephiroth called  Kether the Crown or  <a id="l1060"></a>Beginning, was the Ἀρχὴ of the Gnosticks.  The Cabbalists said that the <a id="l1061"></a>first sephiroth Kether was the principle which conteined all the following Sephiroths <a id="l1062"></a>eminently in it self, &amp; the Gnosticks said the same thing of  Ἀρχὴ the first <a id="l1063"></a>Æon. And The  two next sephiroths Cochmah &amp; Binah Wisdom &amp; Prudence. <a id="l1064"></a>are the same with the two next Æons λόγος &amp; Φρόνησις Reason &amp; Prudence <a id="l1065"></a>Some of the Gnosticks called the supreme father the first man &amp; Ennoia the second man: which names answer to the Arech Anpin &amp; Scir Anpin [&amp; Adam Kalmon] of the Cabbalists. The hereticks of the circumcision  therefore seem to have taken some things from their Cabbala &amp; in this oppinion <a id="l1067"></a>I am confirmed by the Apostle who in opposition to these heresies admonishes <a id="l1068"></a>the Christians not to give heed – – – pretending to science.</p>
<p id="par68">The Gnosticks of the uncircumcision rose later – – – – – –  in the Apocalyps. The Siimonians  [&amp; the Nicolaitan Gnosticks] said that Ennoea was <a id="l1070"></a>very handsom &amp; descending into the lower Orbs to emit the Æons,  enticed <a id="l1071"></a>them by her beauty &amp; was detained by them below &amp; shut up in the bodies <a id="l1072"></a>of weomen &amp; passed from woman to woman by a Pythagoric metempsychosis <a id="l1073"></a> &amp; that the Angels passed into the bodies <a id="l1074"></a>of men that they might enjoy her  And by this <a id="l1080"></a>sort of philosophy &amp; the examples of their Gods they encouraged one another <a id="l1081"></a>in all manner of uncleanness. And in like manner the Nicolaitans  said that Borbelo was very handsom &amp; enticed the other Gods to her embraces &amp; upon this doctrine founded their lascivious practices.  After the example of these Gods  Nicolas the master of the Nicolaitans as Irenæus calls him abandoned his wife to the lust of other men, [&amp; is by Ire<a id="l1083"></a>næus called the master of the Nicolaitans] And Those of this sect invited one <a id="l1084"></a>another to their tables &amp; after eating, the man said to his wife Be <a id="l1085"></a>charitable to the brother. And when the brother had lain with her they offered to their fals Gods <a id="l1086"></a>a filthy sacrifice of the profluvia of men &amp; weomen saying (in derision of the <a id="l1087"></a>Christian religion) This is my body &amp; this is my blood. This abominable sacrifice was first instituted <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p088v"> &lt;88v&gt; </span> by Simon,  the first founder of <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>this<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l1088"></a>heresy. And by all this you may understand that under the names of the Nicolaitans <a id="l1089"></a>&amp; Antichristians the impure  &amp; idolatrous Gnosticks are condemned by Iohn <a id="l1090"></a>in his  Apocalyps &amp; epistles.</p>
<p id="par69">Irenæus tells us that Cerinthus &amp; long before him the Nicolaitans, a branch of the Gnosticks said – – – – <a id="l1091"></a>. . . . . . . . – philosophy of the Nicolaitans. Simon feigned that the first God came down to rescue Ennoia whom <a id="l1092"></a>he called the lost sheep &amp; to save those that beleived on him from the tyranny of the Angels, but had not a <a id="l1093"></a>real body nor suffered on the cross. Others said that Ialdabaoth or Νους was the Christ the saviour who descended upon <a id="l1094"></a>Iesus, others said that this Saviour was another of the Æons. And some said that Iesus was the son of Ioseph &amp; Mary others <a id="l1095"></a>that he passed through Mary as water through a pipe.</p>
<p id="par70">As the Sephiroths of the Cabbalists were nothing else then the powers &amp; affections <a id="l1096"></a>of God the father considered as  divine persons (namely his Crown or first &amp; <a id="l1097"></a>supreme emanation, his Wisdom, his Prudence, his Magnificence, his Power, his Beauty his <a id="l1098"></a>Eternity, his Glory, his being the Support &amp; Foundation of all things &amp; his Reign) so <a id="l1099"></a>the Æons of the Gnosticks were of the same kind. Simon said that Ennoia was the <a id="l1100"></a>first conception of his mind &amp; made her the mother of all the rest. And Basilides said that <a id="l1101"></a>God emitted Νους &amp; Νους emitted Λόγος &amp; Λόγος emitted Φρόνησις &amp; Φρόνησις <a id="l1102"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="22 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>  And Valentinus said that  Αληθεια was the wife of Νους &amp; <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>ennoia<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>  Ζωη the wife of <a id="l1104"></a>Λογος. And all these are nothing else then  the attributes of God or the modes &amp; powers of his being called by the Greeks  his λογος ἐνδιάθετος. Ptolomæus a disciple of Valentinus assigned to the unknown <a id="l1106"></a>father two wives Ennœa &amp; Thelesis, Vnderstanding &amp; Will &amp; called them the affections of <a id="l1107"></a>the unknown father, &amp; said that the understanding was the older wife because the under<a id="l1108"></a>standing precedes the will.  And the Valentinians in one of the books  cited by Epiphanius said: In the <a id="l1110"></a>beginning he who of himself is the father  – – – – – – – – – &amp; therefore Sige is not ἐνδιάθετος <a id="l1111"></a>Iren. l. 2. c. 14, 15, 16, 47, 48, 49.</p>
<p id="par71">The doctrine therefore that the λόγος  or Word of God was the λογος <a id="l1112"></a>ἐνδιάθετος of the father &amp; that the λογος ἐνδιάθετος was emitted or exerted &amp; thereby generated into a son before <a id="l1113"></a>the world began came originally from the Gnosticks Basilides Valentinus Ptolomæus &amp; <a id="l1114"></a>their followers  Secundus Marcus &amp; Heracleon &amp;  from Saturninus the fellow <a id="l1115"></a>disciple of Basilides. ffor Irenæus  blames Saturninus <a id="l1116"></a>Basilides Valentinus &amp; Marcion  &amp; the Gnosticks in general for pretending to know <a id="l1117"></a>the generation of the  Word &amp; explaining it &amp; comparing it to a Word spoken by a <a id="l1118"></a>man. ffrom this opinion the name of Sige was given to Ennœa &amp; therefore it was as old <a id="l1119"></a>as that name. They feigned that God was silent before he spake &amp; thence gave the <a id="l1120"></a>name of silence to his  power of thinking </p>

<p id="par73">The Gnosticks at first said that Christ descended upon Iesus, but after the writing <a id="l1123"></a>of the Apocalyps &amp; Gospel &amp; first Epistle of Iohn &amp; the Epistle to the Hebrews in which Christ <a id="l1124"></a>is called the λόγος, some of the Gnosticks began to say that the Λόγος [descended upon <a id="l1125"></a> Iesus Christ, or assumed him</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p089r"> &lt;89r&gt; </span>
<p id="par74">Cyprian reading  the works of Tertullian as his master <a id="l1126"></a> seems to have imbibed his  notions about the Deity. For he calls the f. s. &amp; h. g. Trinitas adunata &amp;  In the second book of <a id="l1127"></a>testimonies against the Iews (ch. 1) for proving Christ to be the first begotten &amp; <a id="l1128"></a>the wisdom of God by which all things were made, he alledges the words of <a id="l1129"></a>Solomon (Prov. 8.)  Dominus condidit me initium viarum suarum ad opera <a id="l1132"></a>sua, in opera sua ante sæculum fundavit me: in principio antequam terram <a id="l1133"></a>faceret, et antequam abyssos constitueret, priusquam procederent fontes aquarum <a id="l1134"></a>antequam montes collocarentur, ante omnes colles genuit me Dominus. <a id="l1135"></a>&amp; those in Ecclesiasticus: Ego ex ore altissimi prodivi ante omnem crea<a id="l1136"></a>turam. both which places are spoken of  that wisdom which is seated in <a id="l1137"></a>God as his attribute or λογος ενδιαθετος. Ruffin tells us that many in <a id="l1138"></a>the parts about Constantinople took him to be of the same faith in these <a id="l1139"></a>matters, with Tertullian.</p>
<p id="par75">The author of the book de Trinitate ascribed to Novatian, tells  his opinion in these words. <a id="l1140"></a>Antequam nihil præter Patrem. pag. 349.

His meaning seems to be that <a id="l1160"></a>the father was before  the son not in respect of time which was not yet <a id="l1161"></a>created, but in respect of the power of generating  which was in the father <a id="l1162"></a>from all eternity before he generated the son &amp; by the son created time,  <a id="l1163"></a> &amp; that the son was in the father even <a id="l1164"></a>before he  was generated &amp; by generation came out of him. ffor he adds <a id="l1165"></a>Hic ergo quando Pater voluit processit ex patre: Et qui in Patre fuit processit <a id="l1166"></a>ex patre: et qui in Patre fuit quia ex Patre fuit processit ex Patre: et <a id="l1167"></a>qui in Patre fuit quia ex Patre fuit, cum Patre postmodum fuit, quia ex <a id="l1168"></a>Patre processit: substantia scilicet illa divina cujus nomen est Verbum <a id="l1169"></a>per quod facta sunt omnia et sine quo factum est nihil.

By these characters he distingishes the Father from all other beings: but yet He speaks also magnificently of Christ.

He distinguishes Christ from the man  who suffered on the cross &amp; saith that he put on that man &amp; carried him <a id="l1260"></a>about in a small part of himself.  This opinion savours of Platonism, &amp; if we may judge of him by his calling God pater rerum &amp; by the opinion of his disciple Lactantius, he held the <a id="l1265"></a>nativity of the son of God before  the world began.</p>
<p id="par82"> Here Lactantius makes God the Son subordinate in power &amp; dominion <a id="l1266"></a>to his father as the supreme God, the God whom we are to understand whenever <a id="l1267"></a>we speak of one God &amp; whom alone we are to worship as one God.

<p id="par83"> We have heard that  Clemens the master of the <a id="l1270"></a>divinity school at Alexandria was tainted with Platonism, &amp; I beleive <a id="l1271"></a>it will easily be granted that <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> his disciple &amp; successor in that school <a id="l1272"></a>was  not altogether free from error.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p090v"> &lt;90v&gt; </span>

<p id="par85">The  Gnosticks maintaining that the  Angels &amp; other <a id="l1273"></a>creatures were either parts or powers of the substance of God, many of the Christians in <a id="l1274"></a>opposition thereunto  affirmed that they were created out of nothing. <a id="l1275"></a> &amp; because its said that all things were made by Iesus Christ <a id="l1277"></a> it became a growing opinion that  God created all things out of nothing by <a id="l1278"></a>Iesus Christ &amp; by consequence that Iesus Christ was omnipotent, &amp; time &amp; place <a id="l1279"></a>being recconed among the creatures it followed also that Christ was in all time &amp; in all <a id="l1280"></a>place &amp; that he was begotten before all ages &amp; before all time &amp; was always <a id="l1281"></a>with the father, that is, always from the beginning of time. These were the opinions <a id="l1282"></a>of many of them who held that Christ the word was the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος,  the inherent <a id="l1283"></a>reason &amp; wisdom of the father, &amp; that creation  signified the producing of things <a id="l1284"></a>out of nothing &amp; generation the emission of  the λογος out of the father. And these opinions at length occasioned  the  famous dispute in the Church <a id="l1285"></a>of Alexandria,  between Alexander the bishop &amp; Arius one of the Presbyters both parties allowing that the <a id="l1286"></a>father had a λόγος ἐνδιάθετος from all eternity, &amp; Alexander   affirming as you have heard that this λόγος was the son of God,  and Arius  <a id="l1288"></a> that the son was not this λόγος but another <a id="l1289"></a>λόγος a substance begotten by the father out of nothing before the creation of the world. <a id="l1290"></a>&amp; that there was a time when the son was not or a duration of the being of God from all eternity before the son <a id="l1291"></a>was generated by him. Now  Arius &amp; those with him in  an epistle which they sent to Alexander <a id="l1292"></a> in the beginning of the controversy  wrote <a id="l1293"></a>to him in <span class="hspac-n" title="Space left blank."></span> thus. The son . . . . . . . . proper to bodies. <sup class="note" id="n40-ref">[40]</sup>But Alexander avoided these <a id="l1294"></a>difficulties by recconing time among the creatures &amp;  denying that the son <a id="l1295"></a>came out of the father  or out of the womb in any part of time or <a id="l1296"></a>was in him in any part of time before he came out of him, or had any other <a id="l1297"></a>antemundane generation then what was  before all time &amp; <a id="l1298"></a> by consequence from all eternity, there being no prius &amp; posterius in time or duration before  time was created by the son. He affirmed therefore, as I find by his epistles, that the father was always a father &amp; that  the son being the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος <a id="l1300"></a>the only inherent reason &amp; wisdom of the father, was a natural son always <a id="l1301"></a>coexisting with the father  by a generation without beginning &amp; <a id="l1302"></a>coequal to him in all things except paternity &amp; uncapable of mutation. <a id="l1303"></a>And they that opposed Alexander replied that according to this opinion the son <a id="l1304"></a>was ἀγένητος unbegotten, meaning that the necessary &amp; eternal  existence of the λογος ἐνδιάθετος was no generation &amp; by consequence <a id="l1306"></a>amounted to a denial of the father &amp; the son. that the calling him the son of God with respect to such an existence made him ἀγένητον  that the placing the generation of the son in such an existence made the son ἀγένητον &amp; And this is the first material instance <a id="l1307"></a>that I meet with of calling the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος of the father the natural <a id="l1308"></a>son of the father by an eternal generation The eternity of this λογος before he came out of the father by an act of generation was not a new opinion, but the calling this λογος the son of God by an eteral act of generation was a new one ‡<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 90v &gt; </span> ‡ or at least had but few followers before Alexander expoused it.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from higher up f 90v resumes &gt; </span>

This is the <a id="l1330"></a>first &amp; great commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou <a id="l1331"></a>shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.

And hence <a id="l1336"></a>it came to pass that charity or the love of our neighbour is by <a id="l1337"></a>the Apostle commended as the chief of graces  absolutely necessary <a id="l1338"></a>to salvation without which all other graces profit nothing, no not <a id="l1339"></a>though a man out of faith or hope should give his body to be burned. <a id="l1340"></a>And the charity of the first Christians is very conspicuous by their <a id="l1341"></a>keeping in communion &amp; friendship with one another all over the <a id="l1342"></a>Roman Empire  &amp; the nations round about for three hundred <a id="l1343"></a>years together, excepting some ruffles made by the bish<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ops<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of Rome <a id="l1344"></a>Victor &amp; Stephen. How far the first Christians were from falling <a id="l1345"></a>out with one another upon every difference of opinion, as is now the <a id="l1346"></a>practise, is manifest by the communion of the Churches of the circum<a id="l1347"></a>cision &amp; uncircumcision, one of which observed the law &amp; the other <a id="l1348"></a> was forbidden to observe it. For understanding this  it is <a id="l1349"></a>to be noted that the converted Iews or Churches of the circum<a id="l1350"></a>cision were by the unconverted Iews called the sect of the Nazarenes <a id="l1351"></a>(Act. 25) &amp; were all zealous of the law (Act. 21.20 Gal. 2.12, 13.) <a id="l1352"></a> &amp; yet were in communion <a id="l1353"></a>with the Apostles &amp; composed the body of the Church of  <a id="l1354"></a>Ierusalem which in those days was the head of all the Churches. And <a id="l1355"></a>when the dispersion of these Christians  by the wars <a id="l1356"></a>of the Romans was at hand, Matthew wrote his Gospel  in hebrew for their use, &amp; therefore the Nazarenes are not <a id="l1358"></a>to be recconned among the hereticks.

<p id="par96">Now the primitive Church in relation to the Churches of the cir<a id="l1361"></a>cumcision &amp; uncircumcision remained in this state till the days of Iustin <a id="l1362"></a>Martyr &amp; Hegesippus . . . . . . . . . . . itidem non salvari putem.

<p id="par101">And that these Creeds jointly &amp; severally contein the primitive Rule of faith is further confirmed <a id="l1410"></a>by the Scriptures themselves, wherin the articles of this faith are spoken of <a id="l1411"></a>as fundamentals &amp; sometimes expesed in the very same words as in the Creeds. <a id="l1412"></a>the Apostles in preaching sometimes touching upon the articles of their Symbol We preach unto you –– – – baptized.

What the <a id="l1415"></a>Apostles preached  by parts &amp; explained at large to their auditors is   <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 91r &gt; </span>in this Rule of faith comprised in a short form of sound words.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 91v resumes &gt; </span> <span class="pagenumber"> &lt; insertion from the left margin of f 91v &gt; </span>

<div> <h2 id="hd2" class="cent">Chap. 3. <a id="l1420"></a><br>Of the faith which was once delivered to theSaints <br><br></h2>
<p id="par103">For uniting all Christians in one body &amp; preventing disputes which tended to break <a id="l1421"></a>this body into parties the Apostles in the beginning of the Gospel com<a id="l1422"></a>prehended all the articles of faith necessary to communion, in one short <a id="l1423"></a>systeme called the Creed or symbol of faith. And in relation to this Creed <a id="l1424"></a>the Apostle Paul tells us that <sup class="note" id="n41-ref">[41]</sup><em class="underline">there is one body</em> or Church, <em class="underline">one <a id="l1425"></a>Spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God &amp; father of all</em> &amp; exh<a id="l1426"></a>horts us to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of love, that <a id="l1427"></a>is, to be all of one mind. By one faith one baptism he means one <a id="l1428"></a>faith by which all men  were admitted to baptism &amp; one baptism by <a id="l1429"></a>which they were admitted into one  body or church. For <a id="l1430"></a>there were certain principles – – – – – – – – – – – – for he had not <a id="l1431"></a>writ an epistle to them before.</p>
<p id="par104">Now that there was one short &amp; unalterable   rule of faith propagated <a id="l1432"></a>with the gospel into all nations in the beginning &amp; delivered down <a id="l1433"></a> by tradition in the several Churches from one end of the earth <a id="l1434"></a>to the other,  Irenæus declares in <a id="l1435"></a>the following words. The Church, saith he, altho dispersed <a id="l1436"></a>throughout the whole world to the ends of the earth keeps <a id="l1437"></a>that faith which was received from the Apostles &amp; their <a id="l1438"></a>disciples; Which is in one God the father – – – – – – judicare <a id="l1439"></a>vivos et mortuos, per carnis etiam resurrectionem. Hac lege fidei <a id="l1440"></a>manente, cætera jam disciplinæ et conversationis admittunt <a id="l1441"></a>novitatem correctionis, operante scilicet et proficiente usque <a id="l1442"></a>in finem  gratia Dei. And in his book de Præscriptione <a id="l1443"></a>hæreticorum he paraphrases the Creed &amp; then adds. Hæc re<a id="l1444"></a>gula a Christo instituta nullas habet apud nos quæstiones nisi <a id="l1445"></a>quas hæreses  inferunt &amp; quæ hæreticos faciunt. And again in <a id="l1446"></a>his book against Praxeas he paraphrases the Creed &amp; then subjoyns <a id="l1447"></a>Hanc Regulam ab initio evangelij decurrise, etiam ante pri<a id="l1448"></a>ores quosque hæreticos nedum ante Praxeam hesternum probabit <a id="l1449"></a>tam ipsa posteritas omnium hæreticorum quam ipsa  novellitas <a id="l1450"></a>Praxeæ hesterni. By these testimonies of Irenæus &amp; Tertullian <a id="l1451"></a>&amp; also by the testimony of Hegesippus mentioned above, it is manifest <a id="l1452"></a>that in their days all the churches from one end of the earth to the other end thereof <a id="l1453"></a> had one &amp; the same  rule of faith  &amp; agreed in this rule  <a id="l1454"></a>without any disputing about it &amp; by consequence that this Rule was <a id="l1455"></a>propagated into all the Churches at the  first preaching of <a id="l1456"></a>the gospel it being impossible to  propagate it afterwards without <a id="l1457"></a>great disputing. It is manifest also that in the  second century the Churches looked upon this rule of faith as derived <a id="l1459"></a>down to them  by tradition from the Apostles themselves <a id="l1460"></a>  &amp; so <a id="l1461"></a>of divine authority not to be altered by any humane authority <a id="l1462"></a>what ever. As  Emperors &amp; kings, Bishops,  Councils &amp; Popes <a id="l1463"></a>have no authority to alter the  Lords prayer or ten <a id="l1464"></a>commandments or any part of the scriptures so they have none to<a id="l1465"></a>alter the Creed. And its further manifest that the primitive <a id="l1466"></a>Christians looked upon the unity &amp; immutability of this Rule of faith as the  foundation of the unity &amp;  internal peace <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p092v"> &lt;92v&gt; </span>  of the Church &amp; the bulwark by which she stood <a id="l1468"></a>her grownd  against all hereticks &amp; distinguished her <a id="l1469"></a>self from them &amp; from the heathens. For this end the <a id="l1470"></a>Apostles directed the first Christians to keep hold fast &amp; contend for the <a id="l1471"></a>form of sound words, the form of doctrine, the traditions, the faith which was once delivered to <a id="l1472"></a>the saints &amp; declared that there was but one faith. For this end they delivered it down  to the Churches by oral tradition that the heathens might not know <a id="l1473"></a>it but Christians by reciting it might know one another <a id="l1474"></a>&amp; avoyd those as heathens who could not recite it or as hereticks <a id="l1475"></a>who recited it corruptly. And hence the ancient  Christians called it <a id="l1476"></a>the symbol of their faith, by that word alluding to the watch <a id="l1477"></a>word by which  soldiers of a party distinguish themselves from the <a id="l1478"></a>enemy &amp; to the symbols  which heathens were taught at <a id="l1479"></a>their being initiated into the mysteries of any God &amp; were obliged <a id="l1480"></a>to keep secret that they might  by reciting the <a id="l1481"></a>symbol know one another whenever they met.</p>
<p id="par105">Now though the unity of the Church depended upon <a id="l1482"></a>the unity of the faith &amp; therefore the rule of faith was unaliterable <a id="l1483"></a>yet  before the end of the second century some of the <a id="l1484"></a>Latine Churches in opposition to hereticks began to add new articles to it. And after <a id="l1485"></a>they had by adding  some articles in the language <a id="l1486"></a>of the scriptures  made precedents for  creating to them <a id="l1487"></a>selves  a creed-making authority: they began <a id="l1488"></a>to add articles in other language then that of the scripture <a id="l1489"></a>till they lost the primitive Apostolick rule of faith &amp; by <a id="l1490"></a>the loss of it brought all into confusion. </p>



<p id="par109"> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p093r"> &lt;93r&gt; </span> </p>





<p id="par115" class="i0"> first they added  in the language of the scriptures these seven articles <a id="l1551"></a>conceived by the holy Ghost, crucified, dead, sitteth at the right hand of <a id="l1552"></a>God, the  remission of sins, the resurrection of the body &amp; life <a id="l1553"></a>everlasting. These additions were made in the second &amp; third centuries <a id="l1554"></a>&amp; in the fourth &amp; fift they added in other language then that of the <a id="l1555"></a>scriptures these five:  holy catholick church , ὁμοούσιος to the father  descended into hell, who together with the father &amp; the son is worshipped <a id="l1557"></a>&amp; glorified, the communion of saints. In the first century while  any <a id="l1558"></a>of the Apostolick men continued alive the Church remained an uncorrupted <a id="l1559"></a>virgin,  as Hegesippus testifies: but after the death of Iohn the Apostle &amp; <a id="l1560"></a>Symeon bishop of Ierusalem &amp; cousin german of our Lord, heresies began to <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p093v"> &lt;93v&gt; </span> multiply &amp; molest the churches much more then before &amp; when any <a id="l1561"></a>heresy was convicted by any text of scripture, it  may be conceived that <a id="l1562"></a>the Christians in  speaking of that heresy would be apt to magnify that text <a id="l1563"></a>of scripture &amp; recite it in their paraphrases &amp; comments upon the creed <a id="l1564"></a>until at lengh they inserted it into the body of the Creed it self. And by <a id="l1565"></a>this means the articles  conceived by the holy Ghost, , dead, <a id="l1566"></a>sitteth at the right hand of God, the resurrection of the body &amp; the life <a id="l1567"></a>everlasting began to be inserted into the creed  of the Latines before the <a id="l1568"></a>end of the second century. For all these articles crept first into the <a id="l1569"></a>creeds of the Latines &amp; from thence were translated into the Creeds of <a id="l1570"></a>the Greeks in the fourth century. For the Latines were less tenacious <a id="l1571"></a>of the tradition of faith then the Greeks, as is manifest by the <a id="l1572"></a> proceedings of Pope Victor who  in the end of the <a id="l1573"></a>second century turning Cataphrygian, excommunicated the chur<a id="l1574"></a>ches of Asia for keeping Easter on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of the first month of the Luni-solar <a id="l1575"></a>year, which was the ancient year of all nations &amp;  that <a id="l1576"></a>he might not break communion which all the christians of Asia issu<a id="l1577"></a>ed out communicatory letters to the Cataphrygians, &amp; this without any <a id="l1578"></a>regard to the Apostolick tradition of faith which was the primitive rule of communion. <a id="l1579"></a>For there was nothing in the creed concerning holidays. It was <a id="l1580"></a>by the supposed authority of the Church of Rome that Victor did this. <a id="l1581"></a>And by doing it he attempted to make himself universal bishop &amp; the Church of <a id="l1582"></a>Rome supreme over all the  Churches.</p>
<p id="par116"> One of the first articles added to the Creed was sitteth at <a id="l1583"></a>the right hand of God. ffor this is in the Creeds of Tertullian &amp; in all <a id="l1584"></a>those of the Latines now extant but not in the earliest Creeds <a id="l1585"></a>of the Greeks, the two Creeds of Irenæus,  that of Eusebius Pamphili <a id="l1586"></a>&amp; the Nicene – – – – – – – – – – – put under his feet.</p>
<p id="par117">The article <em class="underline">conceived by the holy ghost</em> is wanting – – – – – <a id="l1587"></a>– – – – – before the Article <em class="underline">I beleive in the holy ghost</em>, &amp; makes <a id="l1588"></a>that Article superfluous. And therefore  Tertullian in two of his <a id="l1589"></a>Creeds where he omits the first Article he omitts the last</p>

<p id="par119">Two other new Articles were the resurrection of the body &amp; <a id="l1590"></a>the life everlasting – – – – – – as Christ rose to judge them. But the Gnos<a id="l1591"></a>ticks denying the  real death of Christ &amp; the resurrection of the body <a id="l1592"></a>&amp; life everlasting the Latines  made their Creed more express by  <a id="l1594"></a>adding those words to the end of it &amp; inserting the words <em class="underline">was crucified</em> <a id="l1595"></a>dead. Tertullian has not the life everlasting &amp; adds the resurrection of the body in such a manner as is <a id="l1596"></a>to be met with in no other Creeds then his, &amp; therefore  the addition was not settled in his <a id="l1597"></a>days.</p>
<p id="par120">The  forgiveness of sins is an article not in the creeds of Ireneus <a id="l1598"></a>Tertullian, Lucian, Eusebius, not in those of Nice &amp; Constantinople, nor in that of Ierusalem <a id="l1599"></a>recited by Cyrill. It seems to have been added  by the Latines in the <a id="l1600"></a>middle of the third century in opposition to Novatian. For the first men<a id="l1601"></a>tion of it is in  the end of a Creed  recited by Cyprian  in these words <a id="l1602"></a><em class="underline">remissionem peccatorum et vitam æternam per sanctam ecclesiam.</em></p>
<p id="par121">Hitherto the Christians kept to the scriptures, but now the au<a id="l1603"></a>thority of the Church began to be in vogue, &amp; for magnifying &amp; establishing that autho<a id="l1604"></a>rity they  inserted <em class="underline">the holy catholick church</em> into the Creed. For Alexander <a id="l1605"></a>bishop of Alexandria  a year or two before the meeting of the <a id="l1606"></a>Council of Nice A.C. 323 in making a declaration of his faith inserted it <a id="l1607"></a>in this manner. <em class="underline">We confess also</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">one Holy Ghost</em> —— <em class="underline">&amp; one only <a id="l1608"></a>catholick apostolick church whichis ever inexpugnable tho the whole world<a id="l1609"></a>attack it, &amp; overcomes every impious faction of hereticks who rise up <a id="l1610"></a>against it</em>. And henceforward the holy catholick Church was inserted into <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p094r"> &lt;94r&gt; </span> almost all the Creeds next after the article of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p id="par122">And now the Bishops had almost lost the primitive form of sound <a id="l1611"></a>words in which the faith was once delivered to the saints, every Council be<a id="l1612"></a>gan  to make new articles of faith in their own words.  And particularly The <a id="l1613"></a>Council of Nice  A.C. 225 inserted the word ὁμοουσιος into the Creed;  the Council of Ariminum A.C. 359 inserted this Article, <em class="underline">descended into the <a id="l1615"></a>infernal regions &amp; there performed what was to be done, whom the door-keepers <a id="l1616"></a>of Hell beholding trembled</em>; the Council of Constantinople A.C. 381 inserted <a id="l1617"></a>this, <em class="underline">who together with the father &amp; the son is worshipped &amp; glorified</em>: <a id="l1618"></a>&amp; the Latines about the  beginning of the fift century (I think <a id="l1619"></a>in opposition to Vigilantius) inserted <em class="underline">the communion of saints</em>. For these <a id="l1620"></a>four Articles are generally allowed to be new ones.</p>
<p id="par123">The ancient Creeds of the Greeks generally ended with the article <a id="l1621"></a>of the Holy ghost &amp; the primitive Creed or Creeds of the Latines came <a id="l1622"></a>from the Greeks – – – – – – – – – – – – has been added since the beginning.</p>
<p id="par124">The first Creed of Tertullian above recited is the oldest Creed of <a id="l1623"></a>the Latines now extant  in proper concise words without paraphrastical <a id="l1624"></a>flourishes. And as it is the oldest so it is the least corrupt.  If the words <em class="underline">by the resurrection</em> <em class="underline">of the body</em> which are added to the end of it in such <a id="l1626"></a>a manner as is not to be met with in any other Creed  be omitted &amp; the <a id="l1627"></a>Article of the holy Ghost  which is in all creeds be added, the Creed will <a id="l1629"></a>run thus. Credo in unicum Deum mundi conditorem, &amp; filium ejus <a id="l1630"></a>Iesum Christum, natum ex virgine Maria, crucifixum sub <a id="l1631"></a>Pontio Pilato, tertia die resuscitatum a mortuis, receptum in <a id="l1632"></a>cælis, sedentem nunc ad dexteram Patris, venturum judicare vivos <a id="l1633"></a>et mortuos.  Et Credo in spiritum <a id="l1634"></a>sanctum. Now if this Creed be compared with  the Creeds of  <a id="l1635"></a>the several Churches of the Latines which were afterwards published <a id="l1636"></a> you will find that all  the articles of this Creed  are in all those Creeds &amp; that this Creed agrees with &amp; conteins the <a id="l1638"></a>whole substance of all those Creeds except the Articles which <a id="l1639"></a>we have noted to have  been added to the Creeds of the Latines since <a id="l1640"></a>the days of Pope Victor.  And thence it follows that  <a id="l1641"></a>this Creed of Tertullian is in substance the very Creed of the <a id="l1642"></a>Latine Churches as it stood in the end of the second century <a id="l1643"></a>&amp; that all the articles which we have noted to be new ones have <a id="l1644"></a>been added since those days except the article sedentem ad <a id="l1645"></a>dextram Patris which  might be added a little before. To make <a id="l1646"></a>this manifest, I have subjoyned the principal Creeds of the Latines <a id="l1647"></a>which were published in the fourth &amp; fift centuries that you <a id="l1648"></a>may compare them with Tertullians creed &amp; with one another <a id="l1649"></a>the new articles being inclosed to distinguish them from the rest</p>
<p id="par125">The Creed of the Church of Aquileia  is thus recited by Ruffin  Presbyter of that Church</p>
<p id="par126">The Creed of the Church of Turin is thus set down by Maximus <a id="l1651"></a>Taurinensis </p>
<p id="par127">The Creed of the Church of Ravenna is thus  recited by Petrus Chrysologus <br><br></p>
<p id="par128">The Creed of the Africans is thus  recited by Austin bishop <a id="l1652"></a>of Hippo. <br><br></p>

<p id="par130">Ambrose in an epistle to Pope Syricius has these words <sup class="note" id="n45-ref">[45]</sup>Credatur <a id="l1654"></a>Symbolo Apostolorum quod Ecclesia Romana  intemeratum <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p094v"> &lt;94v&gt; </span> semper custodit et servat. This is that Creed which is still called <a id="l1655"></a>symbolum Apostolorum,  excepting that the descent into hell &amp; the communion of saints have <a id="l1656"></a>been added since the days of Ambrose, &amp; it now runs thus I beleive in <a id="l1657"></a>God the father almighty maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp; in Iesus <a id="l1658"></a>Christ his only son our Lord who was [conceived  by the Holy <a id="l1659"></a>Ghost,] born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius <a id="l1660"></a>Pilate, was [crucified dead &amp;] buried, [descended into Hell] the third day he rose <a id="l1661"></a>again from the dead, ascended into heaven, sitteth  on the <a id="l1662"></a>right hand of God the father Almighty from thence he shall come to judge <a id="l1663"></a>the quick &amp; the dead.  I beleive in the Holy Ghost, [the <a id="l1664"></a>holy catholick Church the communion of saints the forgive<a id="l1665"></a>ness of sins the resurrection of the body &amp; the life ever<a id="l1666"></a>lasting.</p>
<p id="par131">Now if in all these Creeds the articles within the <a id="l1667"></a>brackets be omitted as being added since the end of the second century: you will have the creeds of the Chur<a id="l1668"></a>ches of Aquileia Turin Ravenna Hippo &amp; Rome as <a id="l1669"></a>they stood in the end of that century. And all these <a id="l1670"></a>creeds agree with one another &amp; with the creed of <a id="l1671"></a>Tertullian  &amp; by that agreement make it <a id="l1672"></a>very evident that  one &amp; the same rule <a id="l1673"></a>of faith was propagated down fom the beginning in <a id="l1674"></a>all these Churches </p>
<p id="par132"> Which rule of faith resulting fom all those Creeds <a id="l1691"></a>compared together is this. I beleive in God [or in one God] the Father <a id="l1692"></a>almighty maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp; in Iesus Christ his son [or only son] our <a id="l1693"></a>Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius <a id="l1694"></a>Pilate, &amp; was buried. The third day he rose again from the dead ascend<a id="l1695"></a>ed into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God,  &amp; shall <a id="l1696"></a>come to judge the quick &amp; the dead, &amp; I beleive in the Holy Ghost. <a id="l1697"></a></p>
<p id="par133">The word buried is in all the Creeds but Tertullians &amp;  may be retained because the Apostle Paul  inserts it into the fundamentals <a id="l1699"></a>of faith. For I delivered unto you first of all, saith he, how that Christ <a id="l1700"></a>died for our sins according to the scriptures &amp; that he was buried &amp; that he <a id="l1701"></a>rose again the third day according to the scriptures. 1 Cor. 15.4.</p>
<p id="par134">The Creeds of the Greek Church generally begin thus: I beleive <a id="l1702"></a>in one God the father almighty, maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp; of all things <a id="l1703"></a>visible &amp; invisible, &amp; in one Lord Iesus Christ the son of God. And this <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p095r"> &lt;95r&gt; </span> form is most consonant to the first commandment &amp; to the words of the <a id="l1704"></a>Apostle Paul whenever he speaks of the fundamentals of religion <a id="l1705"></a>as where he says that there is one body one Lord one faith one <a id="l1706"></a>baptism one God &amp; father of all (Ephes 4.4) one God &amp; one mediator between God &amp; man the man Christ Iesus (1 Tim 2.5) <a id="l1708"></a> one God the father of whom are all things &amp; one Lord Iesus <a id="l1709"></a>Christ by whom are all things (1 Cor. 8.6) The article sitteth at the <a id="l1710"></a>right hand of God was  wanting in the oldest creeds of the Greeks &amp; <a id="l1711"></a>in those of Irenæus as was said above &amp; to the article I beleive in the holy Ghost irenæus &amp; the Greeks <a id="l1712"></a>added <em class="underline">who spake by the Prophets</em>, or words to that  purpose. For it is a fundamental point of religion to beleive Moses &amp; the Prophets to be  authentic, tho it be not necessary to understand all their writings. And in some <a id="l1715"></a>of the oldest Creeds the names of Mary &amp; Pontius Pilate <a id="l1716"></a>were omitted.  So then the Symbol or rule of faith in the Greek <a id="l1717"></a>Churches till the days of Irenæus was much to this purpose</p>
<p id="par135">I beleive in one God, the father almighty, maker of <a id="l1718"></a>heaven &amp; earth, &amp; of all things therein visible &amp; invisible; <a id="l1719"></a>&amp; in one Lord Iesus Christ the son of God, who was born of a <a id="l1720"></a>virgin crucified &amp; buried.

<p id="par137">This form of faith is to the very same sense with that <a id="l1724"></a>of the Latines  last mentioned &amp; whether one form or the <a id="l1725"></a>other or a medium between both be used is of no moment. <a id="l1726"></a> But to shew that the last recited   profession of faith is without any material  variation the primitive  Creed of <a id="l1729"></a>the Greek Churches I will here  subjoyn two or three of the oldest Creeds <a id="l1730"></a>of the Greeks,  now extant.</p>
<p id="par138"> In the Council of Nice Eusebius of Cæsarea <a id="l1732"></a>produced a Creed which he said he received from his ancestors &amp; was <a id="l1733"></a>instructed in it before his baptism. This Creed was approved &amp; interpoled <a id="l1734"></a>by the general Councils of Nice &amp; Constantinople &amp; is as follows. I beleive <a id="l1735"></a>in one God the father Almighty creator of all things visible &amp; in<a id="l1736"></a>visible &amp; in one Lord Iesus Christ [the Word of God, God of God, <a id="l1737"></a>light of light, life of life,] the only begotten son, [the first begotten <a id="l1738"></a>of every creature begotten of his father before all worlds  by whom <a id="l1739"></a>all things were made] who for our salvation was incarnate [&amp; <a id="l1740"></a>conversed with men,] who sufered &amp; rose again the third day &amp; <a id="l1741"></a>ascended to his father, &amp; shall come again to judge the quick &amp; the <a id="l1742"></a>dead. I beleive also in one holy Ghost.</p>
<p id="par139">Lucian who was martyred in Dioclesian's persecution, left a Creed <a id="l1743"></a>in writing which was produced in the Council of Antioch A.C. 341 &amp; signed <a id="l1744"></a>by them &amp; again by the Council of Seleucia A.C. 359 &amp; is as follows. Credo in unum Deum omnipotentem  omnium tam  intelligibilium quam  sensibilium opificem et conservatorem; <a id="l1746"></a>et in unum filium Dei unigenitum [ante omnia sæcula subsistentem <a id="l1747"></a>manentemque cum Patre qui ipsum genuit per quem omnia facta sunt <a id="l1748"></a>visibilia et invisibilia,] qui [novissimis diebus juxta voluntatem patris <a id="l1749"></a>descendit et] carnem ex sancta virgine suscepit et [postquam patris <a id="l1750"></a>sui voluntatem omni ex arte implevisset] passus est et resurrexit &amp; ad <a id="l1751"></a>cælum reversus sedet ad dextram Patris.

<p id="par140">Cyrill bishop of  Ierusalem in commenting upon <a id="l1752"></a>the creed of that city, thus recites it. I beleive in one God the <a id="l1753"></a>father almighty, maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp; of all things <a id="l1754"></a>visible &amp; invisible. And in one Lord Iesus Christ the only <a id="l1755"></a>begotten son of God [begotten of his father before all worlds <a id="l1756"></a>the true God by whom all things were made] who was incar<a id="l1757"></a>nate &amp; made man, crucified &amp; buried rose again from the <a id="l1758"></a>dead the third day &amp; ascended into heaven [&amp; sitteth at the right <a id="l1759"></a>hand of the father] &amp; shall come to judge the quick &amp; the dead <a id="l1760"></a>[of whose kingdom there shall be no end:] &amp; in the holy Ghost the <a id="l1761"></a>comforter who spake by the Prophets [&amp; in one holy Catholick Church <a id="l1762"></a>&amp; in the resurrection of the  flesh &amp; in life everlasting.]</p>
<p id="par141">These articles  (except that of sitting at the right <a id="l1763"></a>hand of God are also found in the Creeds of Irenæus &amp; in the oldest Creeds of <a id="l1764"></a>the Greeks now extant, vizt that into which Eusebius Pamphili was baptized &amp; <a id="l1765"></a>which was approved by the Council of Nice, that of Lucian the Martyr which <a id="l1766"></a>was approved by the Council of Antioch A.C. 341, that of Ierusalem com<a id="l1767"></a>mented upon by Cyril bishop of that city, &amp; that in the Apostolick Constitutions <a id="l1768"></a>Lib 8. c. 41. And thence it is  put out of question that  <a id="l1769"></a>these Articles are genuine, &amp; were in the  rule of faith which in the begin<a id="l1770"></a>ing was propagated with the Gospel into all nations. But the Creeds of the <a id="l1771"></a>Greeks began in this manner: <em class="underline">I beleive in one God the father almighty</em> — <em class="underline">&amp; <a id="l1772"></a>in one Lord Iesus Christ</em>: which way of speaking is more conformable to that <a id="l1773"></a>of the Apostle. There is one body &amp; one spirit — one Lord, one faith, one <a id="l1774"></a>baptism, one God &amp; father of all (Eph. 4.4) one God &amp; one mediator between God <a id="l1775"></a>&amp; man, the man Christ Iesus (1. Tim. 2.5) one God the father of whom are <a id="l1776"></a>all things &amp; one Lord Iesus Christ by whom are all things. 1 Cor 8.6.</p>
<p id="par142">So then the creed of the Latines usually called the Apostles Creed conteins <a id="l1777"></a>the whole faith requisite to baptism &amp; communion, besides some super<a id="l1778"></a>fluous Articles which if interpreted innocently may be still retained for the <a id="l1779"></a>sake of peace.</p>
<p id="par143">But for other opinions which create disputes &amp; tend to discord amongst Christi<a id="l1780"></a>ans such as are what Christ did before he was born, &amp; between his death &amp; <a id="l1781"></a>resurrection &amp; what he does now in heaven; in what manner the  quick &amp; <a id="l1782"></a>dead shall be judged &amp; with what sort of bodies they shall rise.</p>
<p id="par144"> Our beleiving in one  God &amp; one Lord &amp;  one holy Ghost is <a id="l1783"></a>  the whole foundation of the christian religion:  The first article <a id="l1784"></a>teaches us to relinquish the worship of the multitude of heathen Gods &amp; worship and glorify the God who made heaven &amp; earth &amp; all things therein, &amp; governs all things by his <a id="l1786"></a>almighty power &amp; universal dominion. The second teaches to give honour &amp; glory <a id="l1787"></a>to the Lord  who died for us &amp; by whom God governs the <a id="l1788"></a>world &amp; will judge the quick &amp; the dead.  The third teaches us to beleive &amp; <a id="l1789"></a>study the scriptures that we may  learn  how to behave our selves <a id="l1790"></a>in this life in order to give a good account at the day of judgment.</p>
<p id="par145">For besides the first principles &amp; fundamentals of religion con<a id="l1791"></a>teined in the doctrine of baptism – – – – offences to come.</p>
<p id="par146">And if we are not to  censure one another &amp; fall out about such <a id="l1792"></a>questions much less are we to make them articles of faith necessary to baptism &amp; <a id="l1793"></a>salvation. Strong meats which are proper for men must not be  mixed with <a id="l1794"></a>the milk which is to be given to babes. The Church has no authority to alter <a id="l1795"></a>the foundation upon which she was built by Christ &amp; his Apostles, none to alter that one <a id="l1796"></a>faith into which all men were baptized &amp; by  one baptism admitted into one church from the <a id="l1797"></a>beginning. To alter this faith is to loosen the bond of the union &amp; endanger <a id="l1798"></a>the dissolution of the whole. To impose any new condition of communion <a id="l1799"></a>is to deny communion to those who by the institution of Christ have a right <a id="l1800"></a>to it, &amp; thereby to condemn the members of Christ as hereticks: which in the language of <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the left margin of f 95v &gt; </span> the scriptures is blaspheming the names of those that dwell in heaven, making war upon the saints &amp; becoming an Antichrist. Let the men of this <a id="l1801"></a>spirit consider the admonition of Christ to those of their temper: Iudge not that ye be not judged, for with what judgment ye judge ye <a id="l1802"></a>shall be judged &amp; with what measure ye meet it shall be measured to you again.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 95v resumes &gt; </span> <span class="pagenumber" id="p096r"> &lt;96r&gt; </span>

For nothing is tangible <a id="l1869"></a>but body. As his mortall body by  the resurrection became an immortal body so his <a id="l1870"></a>immortal body by the  incarnation became a mortal one.

<p id="par161">The grand occasion of errors in the faith has been the turning of the <a id="l1922"></a>scriptures from a moral  &amp; monarchical to a physical &amp; metaphysical  sense, &amp; this has been done chiefly <a id="l1923"></a>by men bred up in the metaphysical theology of the heathen Philosophers  the Cabbalists &amp; Schoolmen  .

And there seems to be    a species  of Angels very commonly <a id="l1975"></a>imployed on Gods messages.

The word  <em class="underline">God</em> is relative &amp; signifies the <a id="l1983"></a>same thing  with Lord &amp; King, but in a higher degree. As we say <a id="l1984"></a>my Lord our Lord your Lord, the  King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords <a id="l1985"></a>the suprem Lord,  the Lord of the earth the servants of the Lord, , serve other Lords, so we may say my God our God, your God, the God of Gods, the supreme <a id="l1987"></a>God,  the God of the earth the servants of God serve other Gods: but we do not say my <a id="l1988"></a>infinite our infinite your infinite, the infinite of infinites,  the infinite of the earth,  the servants of <a id="l1989"></a>the infinite serve other infinites. Where the Apostle told the Gentiles that the <a id="l1990"></a>Gods which they worshipped were not Gods, he did not meane that they were not <a id="l1991"></a>infinites, (for the Gentiles did not take them to be such:) but he meant that <a id="l1992"></a>they had no power &amp; dominion over man. They were fals Gods; not fals in<a id="l1993"></a>finites, but vanities falsly supposed to have power &amp; dominion over man.  And in the same sense the Apostle opposes μορφὴ Θεου to μορφὴ δούλου in saying <span class="ns"></span> Let this mind  [of humility] be in you which was in Christ Iesus, who being in<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 98v &gt; </span> <span class="ns">♀</span> Let this mind  [of humility] be in you which was also in Christ Iesus: <a id="l1995"></a>who being in μορφη Θεου did not acquire by rapine his <a id="l1996"></a>present state of glory: but [on the contrary] emptied himself of the μορφη Θεου <a id="l1997"></a>taking upon himthe μορφη θουλου [by  incarnation,] &amp; being found in <a id="l1998"></a>fashion as a man he [still] humbled himself &amp; became <a id="l1999"></a>obedient unto death even the death of the cross.

And in the same sence the Father is called the God of God the Son. For unto the Son he saith, Thy throne o God <a id="l2003"></a>is for ever &amp; ever, a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom: <a id="l2004"></a>Thou hast loved righteousness &amp; hated iniquity, therefore God, even thy God, hath <a id="l2005"></a>annointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

<p id="par169">When therefore the father is called God &amp; the son is called <a id="l2006"></a>Lord (as is done in the Creed,) it signifies that the ffather is the highest <a id="l2007"></a>Lord &amp; the Son is Lord next under him or that the son sits at the right hand of God. And when the Son is also called <a id="l2008"></a>God it signifies that the  name of God is in him &amp; that he is Lord over all things  under the <a id="l2009"></a>father. And yet they are not two Gods, because a king &amp; his viceroy <a id="l2010"></a>are not two kings, nor is the name God to be understood of both together. <a id="l2011"></a>It allways signifies the father unless by any circumstance it be restrained <a id="l2012"></a>to the son; even as the name King always signifies the  superior King unless by <a id="l2013"></a>any circumstance it be restrained to the viceroy. And as a man may <a id="l2014"></a>give Kings &amp; Princes that  worship which is  suitable to their <a id="l2015"></a>dignity power &amp; dominion over us without being guilty of idolatry, so we may <a id="l2016"></a>give   Christ Iesus a much greater worship that worship which is suitable to his dignity, power &amp; dominion over us with<a id="l2017"></a>out being guilty of idolatry tho he be not the supreme God.  ffor we are to worship him &amp; give him honour &amp; glory as he is the <a id="l2023"></a>Lamb of God which was slain for us, (Apoc 5.) the mediator between God &amp; Man the <a id="l2024"></a>Man Christ Iesus. His worship is founded in the dominion which God gave to his humane nature after his death &amp; resurrection. And if this be called worshipping a creature &amp;  thought a <a id="l2025"></a>crime of the same nature with that of the heathens who worshipped the <a id="l2026"></a><em class="underline">creature more then the creator</em> I answer that by the creature the <a id="l2027"></a>Apostle here means  stocks &amp; stones the worshipping of which was <a id="l2028"></a>idolatry not because they were creatures but because they were vanities <a id="l2029"></a>destitute of power &amp; dominion over us, having eyes without seing &amp; ears <a id="l2030"></a>without hearing &amp; being unable to do us good or hurt. ffor all the old <a id="l2031"></a>Prophets place Idolatry in the worshipping of vanities.  And  <a id="l2035"></a> so doth the Apostle when he tells us that   the Gods of the Gentiles are not Gods, &amp; that an Idol is nothing in the <a id="l2036"></a>world. And  therefore if the giving  honour &amp; glory to the Lamb which was slain be not  worshipping a vanity it can <a id="l2038"></a>not be  Idolatry tho it be worshipping him as a man the Man who humbled h<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>im<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>   </p>  <span class="pagenumber" id="p098v"> &lt;98v&gt; </span>
<p id="par170" class="i0">When therefore the father or son is called God we are to understand it not metaphy<a id="l2039"></a>sically but in a monarchical sense. When  the father is called God &amp; the son <a id="l2040"></a>is called Lord (as is done in the Creed</p>
<p id="par171">There is a worship due even to his humane nature &amp; this is <a id="l2041"></a>founded in the dominion which</p>
<p id="par172" class="i0">The heathens   &amp;  Gnosticks supposed not only their Gods but even the <a id="l2042"></a>souls of men &amp; the stars to be of one substance with the supreme God &amp; yet were Idolaters for worshipping them. And he that is of this opinion <a id="l2043"></a>may beleive Christ  to be of one substance with the father without making him <a id="l2044"></a> more then a meer man . Tis not consubstantiality but   power &amp; dominion <a id="l2045"></a>which gives a right to be worshipped. And to worship a consubstantial being wholy destitute <a id="l2046"></a>of power &amp; dominion is  worshipping a vanity &amp; by consequence idolatry. But <a id="l2047"></a>the giving   honour &amp; glory to the Lamb which was slain the mediator between God &amp; man the Man Christ Iesus is not worshipping a <a id="l2048"></a> vanity &amp; therefore not Idolatry tho it be worshipping Christ as a man  <a id="l2050"></a>the man who humbled himself.</p>
<p id="par173" class="i0">Now this Creed is  short &amp; free from repetitions as a symbol of religion ought to be. It is easy to be understood &amp; remembered by the  common people &amp; <a id="l2051"></a> &amp; so may be compared to milk for babes,  Its articles are in the scriptures in express <a id="l2054"></a>words &amp; so liable to no disputes.

And by these characters it seems to comprehend without any material difference <a id="l2060"></a>that summ of faith which was  at first delivered by memory to all <a id="l2061"></a>Christians as the symbol of communion. I may add that  it conteins not mere theories like some of those Articles <a id="l2062"></a>which we have  omitted but all its Articles are practical truths on which the whole <a id="l2063"></a>practise of religion depends.

<p id="par175">The Christian religion was preached by Christ &amp; his Apostles to the <a id="l2070"></a>meanest of the people, &amp; therefore was suited to theire capacity: <a id="l2071"></a>and what it now conteins above their understanding has been introduced <a id="l2072"></a>since by men of learning.  <a id="l2073"></a>Before  it was corrupted by Philosophers &amp; Learned <a id="l2074"></a>men it consisted in beleiving   &amp; <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp; serving<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; obeying one invisible God or suprem monarch <a id="l2075"></a>of the Vnivers whose dominion is boundless &amp; irresistible: &amp; in this Monarchy  &amp;   one visible <a id="l2077"></a>Lord Iesus Christ by whom God governs the world,  <a id="l2078"></a>the Word or Oracle of God [whose voice is to be obeyed because <a id="l2079"></a>the name of God is in him, &amp;] who by his messenger spake to the <a id="l2080"></a>Prophets.

This religion was easy to be <a id="l2083"></a>understood by the meanest of the people &amp;  was handed down amongst <a id="l2084"></a>them in simplicity, untill  men skilled in the learning of the <a id="l2085"></a>heathens  corrupted it with metaphysicks, &amp; by their eminence <a id="l2086"></a>for learning &amp; humane wisdom getting into  Bishopricks spread <a id="l2087"></a>their opinions amongst the Clergy &amp; great men of the earth. And now <a id="l2088"></a>I have  given an account of the primitive faith preached to the <a id="l2089"></a>poor &amp; handed down amongst them by tradition, it remains that <a id="l2090"></a>I shew by what steps the men of learning have  perplexed this faith <a id="l2091"></a>with  metaphysics  no way tending to a good life &amp; filled it with  subtilties  much above the understanding of the  people,  &amp; destructive to the  right notion of the Monarchy. <br><br></p>
<p id="par176">It was not therefore without reason that eastern bishops  opposed the word <a id="l2094"></a>ὁμοιούσιος to Sabellianism, &amp; in their Councills anathematized the Sabellian &amp; Cataphrygian principles <a id="l2095"></a>&amp; declared against the language of one hypostasis.  In the year 341  Constantius <a id="l2097"></a>entring the western Empire in his war against Magnentius, a very numerus Council <a id="l2098"></a>of eastern bishops met at Sirmium against Photinus bishop of that city a Sabellian <a id="l2099"></a>&amp;  made many declarations   against the Sabellian &amp; Cataphrygian principles &amp; for establishing  the monarchy of the Father:; amongst which <a id="l2100"></a>were these Siquis ingen<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>itu<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>m aut partem ejus ex Maria natum dicere ausit anathema <a id="l2101"></a>est. siquis Dei substantiam d<span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span>ari aut contrahi dixerit anathema sit.

<p id="par177">Now Socrates tells us that the deposition of Photinus by this Council for the heresies of  which they convicted him was universally <a id="l2104"></a>approved both then &amp; afterwards as right &amp; just , &amp; Hillary  seven years after <a id="l2105"></a>sending  to the bishops of Gallia &amp; Britain a copy of the Creed of this Council with the anathemas  against Paul annexed &amp;  saith of the Council.

<p id="par178">Socrates writes that the East &amp; West continued in communion till the <a id="l2108"></a> Council of Serdica</p>
<p id="par179">Socrates writes that after the Council of Serdica the West separated fom the <a id="l2109"></a>east. And that they communicated promiscuously as far as the mountain Suchis which seperates Thrace &amp;<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p099v"> &lt;99v&gt; </span> Illyricum, notwithstanding their differens in the faith, but beyond that mountain that is <a id="l2110"></a>westward they did not communicate. Which is as much as to say that  the Greek  <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Communion<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> communicated with  the Latines but the  Latines  Churches refused to communicate with  the Greeks.

And the judicial proceedings of the Council of Sirmi<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>um<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l2118"></a>against Photinus four years after the council of  Serdica, would not have been universally received <a id="l2119"></a>as authentic had not the Latines Churches been then in communion with the Greeks. Tis certain therefore that <a id="l2120"></a>the Greek &amp; Latine Churches notwithstanding all their  disputes remained in exter<a id="l2121"></a>nal communion with one another till the meeting of this Council of Sirmium &amp; by consequence till the death of Constantius, &amp; his successor Iulian the <a id="l2122"></a>last heathen Emperor. And therefore the separation which the bishop of Rome made from this <a id="l2123"></a>Communion after the death of Iulian was a separation from the visible Church Catho<a id="l2124"></a>lick of Christ. </p>

<p id="par181">The main difference between the Greeks &amp; Latines was about the Vniversal bishopric <a id="l2125"></a>The bishop of Rome claimed appeals from all the  churches, &amp; for gaining this  <a id="l2126"></a>dominion  received into communion such persons as  the Greeks in their Councils <a id="l2127"></a>excommunicated &amp; summoned the Greeks to appear before him in a Council at Rome &amp; give an <a id="l2128"></a>account of their proceedings against these  condemned persons &amp; the  western bishops in the <a id="l2129"></a>Council of Serdica,  proceeded against the Eastern in the same manner:  &amp; these two Councils <a id="l2130"></a>decreed that appeals might be made from all the Churches to the Bishop of Rome: but the eastern <a id="l2131"></a>bishops would not submit. And this controversy  created that misunderstanding which <a id="l2132"></a>was between the Greeks &amp; Latines presently after the Council of Sardica.  But Con<a id="l2133"></a>stantius soon after conquering the western empire made the western bishops submit &amp; subscribe the <a id="l2134"></a>sentence of the eastern Councils, &amp; so quieted this dispute.</p>
<p id="par182">As to the faith, both parties allowed the Nicene decree but interpreted it variously: <a id="l2135"></a>the western bishops by una substantia una usia &amp; una hypostasis, the eastern by ὁμοιούσιος <a id="l2136"></a>&amp; ὅμοιος κατ᾽ ὁυσίαν. And at length for putting an end to the controversy about the interpretation the <a id="l2137"></a>bishops   in the Councils of Sirmium, Nice in Thrace, Ariminum, Seleucia &amp; <a id="l2138"></a>Constantinople  in the years 357, 358, 359 &amp; 360   abolished the use of the word <a id="l2139"></a>usia with its compounds  &amp; that for these resons. 1 because the <a id="l2140"></a>ὁμοούσιος had been rejected by the Council of Antioch which deposed Paul of Samo<a id="l2141"></a>sat  above 50 years before the Council of Nice decreed it &amp; therefore the tradition of the Church was against it. &amp; the proceedings of that Council  were approved by the Church Catholick &amp; therefore being grounded upon  tradition were irreproachable in matters of faith., 2 because the Nicene <a id="l2142"></a>fathers had put it  without mature deliberation, the Emperor Constantine <a id="l2143"></a>coming into the" Council upon a day appointed &amp; proposing &amp; pressing it &amp; getting it decreed at once <a id="l2144"></a>before he went out of the Council 3 Becaus the word ὁμοούσιος was a stum<a id="l2145"></a>bling block to the people being misunderstood by them &amp; leading them into various errors <a id="l2146"></a>4 because it created great disturbances in the Churches &amp;  5 because the word usia with its compounds was not in scripture which com<a id="l2147"></a>mands us to hold fast the form of sound words received from the Apostles of our <a id="l2148"></a>Lord. And for satisfying the Latines that the Greeks kept to the true meaning of the <a id="l2149"></a>Nicene decree the very Acts of the Council were produced in the Council of <a id="l2150"></a>Ariminum &amp; the Latines were shewn that the Nicene fathers them selves in  <a id="l2151"></a>subscribing those Acts had interpreted the word ὁμοούσιος by the word ὁμοιούσιος <a id="l2152"></a>&amp; therefore the language of una substantia una usia &amp; <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>una hyp<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ostasis was not authorised by that C.</p>
<p id="par183">And hence forward the language of una h<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ypostasis<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> began to be left off. <a id="l2153"></a>Yet some few continued to use it till the reign of Iulian or a little longer.  <a id="l2154"></a> &amp; were called Sabellians by those who used the language of three <a id="l2155"></a>hypostases &amp; mutually called thos who used this language Arians till Athanasius in <a id="l2156"></a> the reign of Iulian examining both parties told them that tho they disagreed in words <a id="l2157"></a>they agreed in sense, the one party meaning one hypostasis in  nature &amp; kind, the <a id="l2158"></a>other party meaning three hypostases in number. And its observable that Ierome <a id="l2159"></a> used the language of one hypostasis till <a id="l2160"></a>he got leave from Pope Damasus to use the language of three. Thus was the <a id="l2161"></a>language of one hypostasis  exploded as Sabellian by the Councils of Ariminum <a id="l2162"></a>&amp; Seleucia</p>
