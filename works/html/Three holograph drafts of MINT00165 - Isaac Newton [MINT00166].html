    <p id="par1" class="cent">A Memorial concerning the Trial of the Monies in the Pix <a id="l1"></a>by a Iury before the King or Lords of the Council and <a id="l2"></a>Officers of the Mint. <br><br></p>
    
    <p id="par2">There are in the business of the Mint three trialls of Gold &amp; <a id="l3"></a>silver directed by the Indenture of the Mint to be made each of them <a id="l4"></a>in presence of the Warden Master &amp; Comptroller by sworn Artificers <a id="l5"></a>&amp; being made in their presence they are all conclusive &amp; binding a<a id="l6"></a>gainst the Master otherwise not</p>
    
    <p id="par3">The first of these trialls is of Bullion upon any disagreement be<a id="l7"></a>tween the Master &amp; Importer about the price. In such cases the Kings <a id="l8"></a>Assaymaster tries the Bullion in the presence of the Warden Master &amp; <a id="l9"></a>Comptroller &amp; the Master is then bound to receive it according to such <a id="l10"></a>assay altho his own Assaymaster should tell him it is to his loss.</p>
    
    <p id="par4">The other two trialls are of two pieces taken out of every Iour<a id="l11"></a>ney of new coyned monies, the one triall of one piece before deliver<a id="l12"></a>ance of the monies, the other triall of the other piece reserved in a Pix <a id="l13"></a>till the time of the triall.</p>
    
    <p id="par5">These two trialls are in all respects alike excepting that the one <a id="l14"></a>is made in the Mint by the Kings Assaymaster &amp; Weigher &amp; Teller sworn <a id="l15"></a>at their admission to their Office the other out of the Mint by a <a id="l16"></a>number of Assaymasters Weighers &amp; Tellers chosen out of the com<a id="l17"></a>pany of Goldsmiths &amp; sworn before the Lords of the Councill upon <a id="l18"></a>every new occasion. For which reason the triall is removed from the <a id="l19"></a>Mint to the place where the Council sits. Both these trialls (as well <a id="l20"></a>that without as that within the Mint) are to be made before the <a id="l21"></a>Warden Master &amp; Comptroller &amp; if the monies prove uncovenable <a id="l22"></a>the Master is punished in them both, in the first by recoining <a id="l23"></a>them at his own charge in the latter by making satisfaction to the <a id="l24"></a>King. So that the Officers of the Mint have the same station in both <a id="l25"></a>trialls tho the last Triall be  much more solemn then the other.</p>
    
    <p id="par6">The last Triall is made not at the suit of the King in any of <a id="l26"></a>his usual Courts of Iustice but by vertue of &amp; according to a <a id="l27"></a>contract between the King &amp; the Master set down in the said Indenture <a id="l28"></a>  &amp; therefore <a id="l29"></a>like all the rest of that Indenture is to be looked upon as a part of the <a id="l30"></a>business of the Mint. In this contract the Master consents on his part that <a id="l31"></a>the Pix shall be opened &amp; assays be made before his Majesty or such of <a id="l32"></a>his Council as his Majesty shall appoint &amp; his Majesty consents on his part <a id="l33"></a>that the Assays shall be made in presence of the Master &amp; both <a id="l34"></a>parties agree that the Assays shall be made in presence of the War<a id="l35"></a>den &amp; Comptroller, the King entrusting them against the Master 
    
    <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p259v"> &lt;259v&gt; </span>
    
    as well with the inspection of the triall by reason of their skill <a id="l36"></a>as with the custody &amp; keys of the monies untill the Triall be made.</p>
    
    <p id="par7">What Artificers and how many shall make the Assays is <a id="l37"></a>not said in the Indenture but the custome has been (for the <a id="l38"></a>solemnity and credit of the Triall)  not to make use of the <a id="l39"></a>Artificers of the Mint but of others chosen out of the Goldsmiths <a id="l40"></a>Company to the number of 24 &amp; sworn in manner of a Iury. <a id="l41"></a>This is a Iury of enquiry not of judgment.  Their business is <a id="l42"></a>not to hear witnesses &amp; debate &amp; judge but only to survey the <a id="l43"></a>workmanship of the coyn &amp; try or examin it by experiment accord<a id="l44"></a>ing to Art in the presence of both parties &amp; report the bare matter <a id="l45"></a>of fact for making up an accompt between them about the coynage <a id="l46"></a>unto that day. If upon triall the monies prove worse in weight <a id="l47"></a>&amp; fineness then standard and yet within the remedy  <a id="l48"></a>the lack thereof is entred of record by the Warden &amp; Comptroller <a id="l49"></a>&amp; thereupon the Master becomes proportionally debter to the King <a id="l50"></a>if better then standard the King remitts of the debt to the Master <a id="l51"></a>if of just weight &amp; allay the recconing is eaven and at the foot <a id="l52"></a>of this recconing the Master  <a id="l53"></a>has his Acquittance &amp; Quietus under the broad seal whereby he is <a id="l54"></a>quit excused &amp; discharged to that day against his Majesty &amp; people <a id="l55"></a>from further examination of the matter or molestation about it: <a id="l56"></a>but if the money prove without the remedy he makes fine &amp; ran<a id="l57"></a>some at the Kings-will.</p>
    
    <p id="par8">In this Triall therefore the King &amp; the Master are the parties <a id="l58"></a>concerned who have referred themselves to this way of Tryall <a id="l59"></a>by consent &amp; contract, so that the Master cannot be said to be <a id="l60"></a>under prosecution. There is no accusation charge or action against <a id="l61"></a>him, no reflexion upon him before the triall be made.</p>
    
    <p id="par9">Much less do the Warden &amp; Comptroller appear at the barr of a <a id="l62"></a>Court of Iustice. Neither are they present as idle &amp; insignificant <a id="l63"></a>spectators, but as the Kings Officers necessarily upon duty in their <a id="l64"></a>several stations in this Court under the Kings or Lords of the <a id="l65"></a>Council then present, it being their buisiness in behalf of his Majesty <a id="l66"></a>&amp; People to keep the Keys of the Pix till the day of the triall &amp; then <a id="l67"></a>to see that the triall be rightly made &amp; to enter it of record <a id="l68"></a>&amp; make a true accompt thereof to the King that the same may <a id="l69"></a>be fully answered to his Majesty.</p>
    
    <p id="par10">As for the Gentlemen of the Iury whatever be their <a id="l70"></a>Character in other respects they are in this Triall the Kings sworn <a id="l71"></a>Assaymasters Weighers &amp; Tellers acting in the room of the Kings <a id="l72"></a>ordinary sworn Assaymaster &amp; Weigher &amp; Teller of the Mint, and
    
    <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p260r"> &lt;260r&gt; </span>
    
    accordingly are bound to act by the same rules set down in the <a id="l73"></a>above mentioned Indenture. Whereby it is plain that the Iury are <a id="l74"></a>not to exclude the said Officers of the Mint from any part of the <a id="l75"></a>Triall nor to propose to them at any time to withdraw, but that <a id="l76"></a>they continue together untill the Veredict be given in, the Officers <a id="l77"></a>of the Mint being considered under the same character as if the <a id="l78"></a>whole business were transacted in their Office in the Mint.</p>
    
    <p id="par11">For the business of this Iury being not a judgment made by <a id="l79"></a>hearing Witnesses &amp; debating thereupon but a bare report of precise <a id="l80"></a>matter of fact: tis not in the power of the Officers of the Mint <a id="l81"></a>to influence the Iury by their presence, unless in giving them notice <a id="l82"></a>as they ought, where the trialls are not duly made. If the Iury <a id="l83"></a>be at liberty to repeat the Assays of weight &amp; fineness till they <a id="l84"></a>themselves are satisfied, they can have no reason to complain: and <a id="l85"></a>if they are bound to do it till the Officers of the Mint are also <a id="l86"></a>satisfied this makes the Trial of greater force to conclude both parties <a id="l87"></a>&amp; satisfy the whole Nation then if it depended upon the oaths &amp; <a id="l88"></a>skill of  the Iury alone on a triall made in private.  Such a <a id="l89"></a>private Triall would not bind the Master because not made accord<a id="l90"></a>ing to his contract with the King. Nor perhaps would it be advisa<a id="l91"></a>ble for the King to let the Mint by such private Trialls come <a id="l92"></a>into the hands of the Company of Goldsmiths &amp; by being at their <a id="l93"></a>mercy be secretly swayd &amp; governed by their interest. And there<a id="l94"></a>fore a publick solemn triall is appointed by the Indenture which is <a id="l95"></a>the sole grownd of this triall &amp; rule by which they are sworn to <a id="l96"></a>proceed in making it.</p>
