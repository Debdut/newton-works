<p id="par17">Sir</p>
<p id="par18">I have perused the printed sheets which you left in my hands &amp; <a id="l148"></a>beleive that the Letter of M. Leibnitz to M<sup>r</sup> Remond which is printed in <a id="l149"></a>the eighth place should have been printed in the second, the contents <a id="l150"></a>thereof relating to the Postscript of the Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l151"></a>l'Abbé Conti which is printed in the first place. Also the Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Leib<a id="l152"></a>nitz to M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti which was writ in answer to mine &amp; is dated <a id="l153"></a>9 April 1716 should have come before the Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l154"></a>to Madam  la Comtess de Kilmansegger dated 18 April 1716</p>
<p id="par19">None of the Letters being written to me I did not think it <a id="l155"></a>my self concerned to answer any of them till M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Contj <a id="l156"></a>sollicited me to answer the Posctscript of his first Letter  that my Answer as well as that Postscript <a id="l158"></a>might be shewen to the King. But when my Answer was sent <a id="l159"></a>to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnits with a Letter of M<sup>r</sup> l' Conti &amp; he sent both open to M<sup>r</sup> Remond at Paris with <a id="l160"></a>his Answer to them as he had done the Poscript before, &amp; his <a id="l161"></a>Answer was sent from M<sup>r</sup> Remond to M<sup>r</sup> L'Abbé Conti &amp; he gave <a id="l162"></a>M<sup>r</sup>  l'Abbe Conti notice that he took this Method that he might <a id="l163"></a>have neutral &amp; intelligent witnesses of the dispute,  I refused to  an Answer <a id="l165"></a>to be sent to him &amp; only wrote some  Remarks upon <a id="l166"></a>his Answer &amp; shewed them privately to some friends here to <a id="l167"></a>satisfy them that it was easy to have returned an Answer had I <a id="l168"></a>thought fit to let him go on with his politicks. And as soon as I heard <a id="l169"></a>that he was dead I  caused  the Letters <a id="l170"></a> to be printed with those Remarks least they should come out <a id="l171"></a>imperfectly abroad. </p>
<p id="par20">At the same time that these Letters were sent to M<sup>r</sup> Remond <a id="l172"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz wrote also to Madam la Comtesse de Kilmansegger &amp; a <a id="l173"></a>large Poscript to the Baron Bothmar,   about these matters.  And this Letter &amp; <a id="l176"></a>Postscript were then shewed me, but  they being not written to me I did <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>not<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l177"></a>write any Answer to them; &amp; much less do I think it proper for me <a id="l178"></a>now to meddle with them, M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz being dead.</p>

<p id="par22">There was also at the same time a Panegiric upon M<sup>r</sup> I. <a id="l187"></a>Bernoulli &amp; a Satyr upon D<sup>r</sup> Keill  written by an anonymous <a id="l188"></a>author &amp; published <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>I<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>n the Acta eruditorum for Iuly 1716.

<p id="par29">I wrote the Book of Quadratures in the year 1676, except – – – <a id="l250"></a>– – published by M<sup>r</sup> Iames. He that compares that Letter with those <a id="l251"></a>Propositions &amp; particularly with the second  Corollary of the 10<sup>th</sup> <a id="l252"></a>Proposition will easily see that  I had composed those Propositions <a id="l253"></a>before I wrote that Letter.

<h2 id="hd1" class="left">To the Reader</h2>
<p id="par31">Towards the end of the year 1715  (I think about <a id="l263"></a>November) M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz writing to M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbe Conti then at London <a id="l264"></a>about the systeme of M<sup>r</sup> Nigrisoli, added a large Postscript  <a id="l265"></a>about the invention of the Differential Method. And the Postscript was sent also <a id="l266"></a>to M<sup>r</sup> Remond at Paris. The  Postscript not being written to me I <a id="l267"></a>did not think my self concerned to meddle with it. But M<sup>r</sup> Leib<a id="l268"></a>nitz  declining to answer  the <a id="l269"></a>Commercium Epistolicum or to meddle with any body but me:  M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l270"></a>l'Abbé le Conti at length pressed me to write an Answer to the Post<a id="l271"></a>script that  they might both be shewed to the King.  <a id="l272"></a>And when  my Answer was  sent to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l273"></a>he wrote an Answer to it &amp; sent it  with his Answer open to M<sup>r</sup> Remond at Paris &amp; the Answer was <a id="l274"></a>sent by M<sup>r</sup> Remond to  M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbe conti. This tricking management <a id="l275"></a>compared with the beginning of his Answer made me sensible that  he was upon a design of setting aside <a id="l276"></a> the ancient Records published in the Commercium <a id="l278"></a>Epistolicum, &amp; stripping me of my friends, &amp; attaquing me alone with all his <a id="l279"></a>posse of disciples &amp; all his interest   Whereupon I refused to <a id="l280"></a>write an Answer  to be sent to him &amp;  yet to satisfy my <a id="l281"></a>friends that it was easy to have answer him had I thought fit to let him go on with his politiques, I wrote an Answer in the form <a id="l282"></a>of Observations &amp; shewed them privately to some of my friends.  And as soon <a id="l283"></a>as I heard that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was dead  I caused the Letters &amp; Obser<a id="l284"></a>vations to be printed least they should at any time hereafter come <a id="l285"></a>abroad imperfectly in France.</p>
<p id="par32">There were some other Letters writ by M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz, M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé <a id="l286"></a>Conti, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Remond; &amp; by M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti left in the hands of ** <a id="l287"></a>M<sup>r</sup> de M. to be published together with what I had caused to be <a id="l288"></a>published before. And a few days since a   copy of the same was brought <a id="l289"></a>to me printed off except the last sheet. But they being put together <a id="l290"></a>in wrong order I have caused them to be reprinted in due order of <a id="l291"></a>time, together with a  Paper </p>
<p id="par33"> He never pretended to have <a id="l298"></a>found it earlier. And when he wrote his Letter of 27 Aug. <a id="l299"></a>1676 he placed the perfection of Analysis not in the differen<a id="l300"></a>tial calculus as he did afterwards but in a method founded on Analytical Tables <a id="l301"></a>of Tangents &amp; the combinatory Art. <em class="underline">Nihil est</em>, saith he, <a id="l302"></a><em class="underline">quod norim in tota Analysi momenti majoris</em>. And a little <a id="l303"></a>after: <em class="underline">Ea vero non differt ab Analysi illa  SVPRE<a id="l304"></a>MA ad cujus intima Cartesius non pervenit.

And <a id="l306"></a>in answer to what I had said  in my letter of 13 Iune <a id="l307"></a>1676 concerning the universality of my method he replied: <em class="underline">id <a id="l308"></a>mihi non videtur</em>. In October following he came to London <a id="l309"></a>the second time &amp; there met with D<sup>r</sup> Barrows Lectures &amp; saw <a id="l310"></a>my Letter of Octob. 24, 1676, &amp; three months before received a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p385v-c"> &lt;385v&gt; </span>copy of my Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Colling of 10 Decem 1672</p>

<p id="par34">Sir</p>
<p id="par35">I have perused the printed sheets which you left in my hands <a id="l311"></a>&amp; beg leave to take notice that when the Postscript of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz's first <a id="l312"></a>Letter to M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti  was shewed to me:  <a id="l314"></a>I did not think my self concerned to  meddle with it, till at length <a id="l315"></a>I was pressed by  M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti to answer it that the Postscript with <a id="l316"></a>my Answer might be shewed to the King. And when M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz sent it <a id="l317"></a>with his Answer to M<sup>r</sup> Remond at Paris &amp; his Answer was sent open <a id="l318"></a>from Paris to M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti  I refused to write  <a id="l319"></a>any  thing more to be sent to him.    But yet I wrote a Paper of Re<a id="l323"></a>marks upon his  Letter &amp; shewed it to some friends in private to <a id="l324"></a>let them see how easy it was to have answered his Letter had I thought <a id="l325"></a>fit to let him go on with his Politiques. And whe I heard that he was <a id="l326"></a>dead I printed the Letters with these Remarks least they should be publish<a id="l327"></a>ed  imperfectly abroad.  And since you are reprinting them with <a id="l328"></a>some other Letters written at the same time,  &amp; in some of those Letters he tells his own story at large; <a id="l330"></a>tho I will not write an Answer to those letters now he is dead; yet  since in his Letter of 4 March 1711 when I  <a id="l332"></a>knew not  what had been printed against me Six years before in the Acta Eruditorum <a id="l333"></a>nor was any way concerned in this controversy, he appealed  to <a id="l334"></a>me  against D<sup>r</sup> Keill &amp; would  contend with no body <a id="l335"></a>but me nor let me rest till I  set pen to paper: I think I may <a id="l336"></a>be allowed to tell the story my self,  &amp; leave it to be com<a id="l337"></a>pared with his Narrations.</p>
<p id="par36"> &amp; as to the Method of fluxions he never pretended to have found it before the year 1676. M<sup>r</sup> Iames Gregory died in the end of the year 1675, &amp; when the news came to Paris <a id="l344"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz desired that the Letters &amp; Papers of M<sup>r</sup> Gregory might be <a id="l345"></a>collected &amp;  a copy of them sent to Paris which was done in Iune <a id="l346"></a>following. He desired also that the demonstration of some of my series (meaning <a id="l347"></a>the method of finding them which I had sent to <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span><span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>bo<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span>rs in the Analysis per Æquationes numero terminorum infinitas) might be procured from M<sup>r</sup> Collins &amp; sent to <a id="l348"></a>him, &amp; promised to send back something of his own in recompence: whereupon <a id="l349"></a>at the request of M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Collins, I wrote my Letter of 13 <a id="l350"></a>Iune 1676.  And this Letter was sent to him at the same time with <a id="l351"></a>the aforesaid collection of Gregories Letters In that Collection was a <a id="l352"></a>copy of a Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Gregory  dated 5 Sept 1670 signifying that he had improved <a id="l353"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Barrows method of Tangents  into a general <a id="l354"></a>method of drawing Tangents without any calculation. There was also <a id="l355"></a>sent him in the same Collection a copy of one of my Letters to M<sup>r</sup> Collins dated 10 Decem. 1672, in <a id="l356"></a>which I said that the Method of Tangents of Gregory &amp; Slusius were a <a id="l357"></a>branch or corollary of my general method of Analysis, &amp; that this method <a id="l358"></a>stuck not at surds, &amp; that I had interwoven this Method with the method <a id="l359"></a>of Series, meaning in a Tract which I wrote of them both in the year 1671. <a id="l360"></a>And by these Letters it was easy to understand that D<sup>r</sup> Barrows method of <a id="l361"></a>Tangents was capable of being improved so as to give the method of Tangents <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p388r"> &lt;388r&gt; </span> of Gregory &amp; Slusius, &amp; that this Method was capable of further im<a id="l362"></a>provement so as to give my general Method of Analysis. In my Letter <a id="l363"></a>of 13 Iune I said: Ex his videre est quantum fines Analyseos per <a id="l364"></a>hujusmodi  infinitas æquationes ampliantur: quippe quæ, earum bene<a id="l365"></a>ficio, ad omnia pene dixerim problemata (si numeralia Diophanti et <a id="l366"></a>similia excipias) sese extendit; non tamen omnino universalis evadit <a id="l367"></a>nisi per ulteriores quasdam methodos eliciendi series infinitas — Sed <a id="l368"></a>quomodo in istis casibus procedendum sit, jam non vacat dicere ut neque <a id="l369"></a>alia quædam tradere quæ circa Reductionem infinitarum serienum in <a id="l370"></a>finitas, ubi rei narua tulerit, excogitavi. Nam parcius scribo quod hæ <a id="l371"></a>speculationes diu mihi fastidio esse cœperunt; adeo ut ab ijsdem jam per <a id="l372"></a>quinque fere annos abstinuerim. And to this M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Letter of <a id="l373"></a>27 Aug. 1676 replied: Quod dicere videmini plerasque difficulcates <a id="l374"></a>exceptis Problematibus Diophantæis) ad series infinitas reduci; id mihi <a id="l375"></a>non videtur. Sunt enim multa usque adeo mira et implexa ut neque ab <a id="l376"></a> And these things induce me to beleive that <a id="l385"></a>he wrote this Letter before he found the Differential Method.</p>

<p id="par38">M<sup>r</sup> Iames Bernoulli in the Acta Eruditorum for December 1691 <a id="l410"></a>pag. 14, said that the Calculus of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was founded in that of <a id="l411"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Barrow &amp; differed not from it except in the notation of differenti<a id="l412"></a>als &amp; some compendium of operation. And the Marquess de l'Hospital <a id="l413"></a>in the Preface to his Analysis of infinite petits published A.C. 1696 <a id="l414"></a>represented that where D<sup>r</sup> Barrow left off M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz proceeded, &amp; that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p451r"> &lt;451r&gt; </span> the improvement which he made to D<sup>r</sup> Barrows Analysis consisted in <a id="l415"></a>excluding fractions &amp; surds: but he did not then know that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnis <a id="l416"></a>had notice of this improvement from me by  two Letters above <a id="l417"></a>mentioned, dated 10 Decem. 1672 &amp; 24 Octob. 1676. After he had <a id="l418"></a>notice that such an improvement was to be made, he  might find it pro<a id="l419"></a>prio Marte, but by that notice knew that I had it before him.</p>
<p id="par39">In the end of the year 1669 M<sup>r</sup> Collins sent notice to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l420"></a>Iames Gregory that I had a general method of Series &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Gregory by <a id="l421"></a>this Notice &amp; one of my Series being put upon searching after this <a id="l422"></a>method found it after a years study. But tho he found it proprio <a id="l423"></a>Marte yet  because he knew that I had it before him, he <a id="l424"></a>never claimed a right to it.</p>

<p id="par41"> <em class="underline">Data <a id="l450"></a>æquatione fluentes quotcunque quantitates involvente, invenire fluxiones, &amp; <a id="l451"></a>vice versa</em>. This second volume came abroad in the year 1693, two years <a id="l452"></a>before the first Volume, &amp; three years before the Marquess de l'Hospital <a id="l453"></a>published his Analysis des infinitement petits. And this is a demonstration <a id="l454"></a>that in those days I used prickt letters, &amp; understood second third &amp; fourth <a id="l455"></a>fluxions:   &amp; that my Rule for finding them was  not only the first that was invented but also the first that was made publick. When I considered only first fluxions I seldom <a id="l457"></a>used letters with pricks. But when I considered also second third &amp;  <a id="l458"></a>fourth fluxions I distinguished them by letters with one two or more pricks <a id="l459"></a>&amp; for fluents I put the fluxion either included within a square (as in the above mentioned Analysis) or with <a id="l460"></a>a square prefixed (as in some other papers) or with an oblique line upon it. And these notations <a id="l461"></a>by pricks &amp; oblique lines are the shortest &amp; best yet used, but were not known <a id="l462"></a>to the Marquess de l'Hospital when he recommended the differential <a id="l463"></a>notation, nor are necessary to the Method.</p>

<p id="par42">Sir</p>
<p id="par43">I have viewed the printed papers you left in my hands. The Remarks <a id="l464"></a>are only upon the Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz to M. l'Abbé Conti dated 9 Apr. 1716. <a id="l465"></a>The Letters to the Princess &amp; the Comtesse of Kilmansegger, &amp; the Postscript of a Letter to <a id="l466"></a>Baron Bothmar are without an Answer; &amp; I do not see that they need any. <a id="l467"></a>None of his Letters were writ to me, &amp; I had not answered any of them <a id="l468"></a>had not M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti pressed me to write an answer to the Postscript of <a id="l469"></a>  a Letter to him that both might be shewed to the King. But when I found that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l470"></a>sent  all the Letters open to Paris &amp;  his answer came hither from thence I <a id="l471"></a>declined  writing any more Letters &amp; only  wrote the Remarks upon  that Answer <a id="l472"></a>to satisfy my friends here that what he writ was easy to have been answered, if it <a id="l473"></a>had come hither directly. The Commercium Epistolicum notwithstanding any <a id="l474"></a>thing which has hitherto been said against it, remains in full force, &amp; while <a id="l475"></a>that remains unshaken there is no need of  writing any thing further <a id="l476"></a>about these matters.</p>
<p id="par44">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz objected against it that in printing the ancient <a id="l477"></a>Letters &amp; papers many things had been omitted which made for him &amp; <a id="l478"></a>against me: but in offering to prove this twice by  instances he failed as <a id="l479"></a> often.  He objected also that the Committee of the R. Society strained <a id="l480"></a>things against him by fals interpretations, &amp; particularly that they <a id="l481"></a>had maliciously interpreted the words of the Acta Eruditorum for <a id="l482"></a>Ianuary 1705, by saying: <em class="underline">Sensus verborum est quod Newtonus fluxi<a id="l483"></a>ones pro differentijs Leibnitianis substituit</em>: but he has misinterpreted <a id="l484"></a>the place himself. For the Editors of the Acta in this Paragraph, <a id="l485"></a>call M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the INVENTOR, &amp; thence deduce this conclusion <a id="l486"></a><em class="underline">Pro differentijs</em> IGITVR <em class="underline">Leibnitianis Newtonus adhibet, semperque</em> [pro <a id="l487"></a>differentijs illis] <em class="underline">adhibuit fluxiones — ijsque tum in suis Principijs <a id="l488"></a>Naturæ Mathematicis, tum in alijs postea editis</em> [pro differentijs illis] <a id="l489"></a><em class="underline">eleganter est usus</em> QVEMADMODVM ET <em class="underline">Honoratus Fabrius in <a id="l490"></a>sua Synopsi Geometrica motuum progressus Cavallerianæ methodo <a id="l491"></a>substituit</em>. This is the interpretation which the Committee put upon the <a id="l492"></a>place, &amp; the words igitur &amp; quemadmodum &amp; enforce it; &amp; therefore the objection vanishes, &amp; the Commercium Epistolicum remains untouched</p>
<p id="par45">It has been  alledged that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz found the Method by himself. But <a id="l493"></a> second inventors have no right. Whether M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz found the method by himself or not is not the Question. The Committee of the Royall Society did not enter into <a id="l494"></a>this Question, but on the contrary said: <em class="underline">We take the proper Question to be, <a id="l495"></a>not who invented this or that Method, but who was the first inventor of <a id="l496"></a>the Method. And we beleive that those who have reputed M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the <a id="l497"></a>first Inventor, knew little or nothing of his correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Collins <a id="l498"></a>&amp; M<sup>r</sup> Oldenbourg long before, nor of M<sup>r</sup> Newton's having the Method <a id="l499"></a>above 15 years before M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  began to publish it in the Acta Eru<a id="l500"></a>ditorum of Leipsic.</em> Here the Committee treat M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz as second inventor &amp; complain of  him only for pub<a id="l501"></a>lishing the Method as his own without  making any mention of the corres<a id="l502"></a>pondence which he had with me &amp; my friends about it long before he <a id="l503"></a> published it. By that correspondence he had notice in Iune or Iuly 1676 that I had a <a id="l504"></a>very general Method of Analysis, which  extended to the abstruser sorts of Problems &amp; that this Analysis proceeded <a id="l505"></a>without stopping at Surds, &amp; that it was an improvement of the Method <a id="l506"></a>of Tangents of Gregory &amp; Slusius, &amp; that the method of Tangents of Gregory was <a id="l507"></a>an improvement of the Method of Tangents of Barrow.  &amp; that I had it when I wrote my Letter of 10 Decem 1672 &amp; that I had interwoven this method with the method of infinite series before I wrote that Letter And in October 1676 he had <a id="l509"></a>further notice of these things &amp; met with D<sup>r</sup> Barrows Lectures in London &amp; <a id="l510"></a>in his Letter of 21 Iune 1677 sent back an improvement of D<sup>r</sup> Barrow's <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p389v"> &lt;389v&gt; </span> method of Tangents so as to give the Method of Gregory &amp; Slusius &amp; to <a id="l511"></a>proceed without stopping at surds, &amp; then added: <em class="underline">Arbitror quæ celare voluit <a id="l512"></a>Newtonus de Tangentibus ducendis ab his non abludere. Quod addit, ex hoc <a id="l513"></a>eodem fundamento quadraturas quoque reddi faciliores me in  sententia <a id="l514"></a>hac confirmat.</em>  These last words relate to the notice which he had also, that my <a id="l515"></a>method produced  Theorems for squaring of curvilinear figures by con<a id="l516"></a>verging series which in some cases break off, &amp; become finite; &amp; that it pro<a id="l517"></a>duced also  Theorems for comparing curvilinear figures with the Conic <a id="l518"></a>sections: but how it produced these Theorems he was not able to find out. <a id="l519"></a>He had notice also that my Analysis by the help of converging Equations <a id="l520"></a>was so general as to extend to almost all Problems except some nu<a id="l521"></a>meral ones like those of Diophantus; but in his Letter of 13 Aug. 1676 he <a id="l522"></a>questioned its being so general &amp; placed the perfection of Analysis in Analytical <a id="l523"></a>tables of tangents &amp; the combinatory art &amp; therefore was hitherto a stranger to the Differential  Analysis. He had notice also that I had this <a id="l524"></a>method when I wrote my Letter of 10 Decem 1672 &amp; that I wrote a Tract <a id="l525"></a>upon it in   the year 1671. And tho after all these notices he might find out the method propria marte, yet by publishing it as his own eight yers <a id="l527"></a>after the correspondence by which he had all these notices, &amp; doing it without men<a id="l528"></a>tioning that correspondence; he put me upon a necessity of mentioning it in <a id="l529"></a>the Book of Principles, &amp; gave just occasion to the Committee of the R. <a id="l530"></a>Society to do the like. </p>
<p id="par46">M<sup>r</sup> Iames Bernoulli in the Acta Eruditorum for Decem. 1691 <a id="l532"></a>&amp; the Marquess de l'Hospital in the Introduction to his Analysis repre<a id="l533"></a>sented that the differential Method was an improvement of D<sup>r</sup> Barrow's <a id="l534"></a>Method of Tangents, &amp; the Marquess represented further that the im<a id="l535"></a>provement lay in shewing how to proceed without stopping at surds: <a id="l536"></a>but the Marquess did not then know that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had notice of <a id="l537"></a>this improvement  from me before he found it, &amp; the Committee <a id="l538"></a>complained of him justly for concealing this &amp; all the other notices.</p>
<p id="par47">It has been said that in the old Letters &amp; Papers published in <a id="l539"></a>the Commercium Epistolicum there are no prickt letters. And indeed <a id="l540"></a>I seldome used prickt letters when I considered only first fluxions, as <a id="l541"></a>in the Introduction to the Book of Quadratures: but when I considered <a id="l542"></a>also second third &amp; fourth fluxions, as in the body of the book, I dis<a id="l543"></a>tinguished them by the number of pricks. In the year 1692, at the request <a id="l544"></a>of D<sup>r</sup> Wallis I sent to him the first Proposition of the Book of qua<a id="l545"></a>dratures with its solution &amp; examples in first &amp; second fluxions, <a id="l546"></a>copied almost verbatim from the book, I sent him also the method of extracting fluents out of Equations involving fluxions, which to the best of my memory was composed in the year 1671: &amp; the Doctor printed them <a id="l547"></a>both the same year in the second Volume of his works which came abroad <a id="l548"></a>the next year A.C. 1693. And thence it may be understood that the Book of <a id="l549"></a>Quadratures was then in manuscript. In my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 <a id="l550"></a>I set down the first Proposition of this Book verbatim in an Ænigma, &amp; said that it <a id="l551"></a>was the foundation of the method there concealed, &amp; that it gave me gene<a id="l552"></a>ral Theorems for squaring of figures by series which sometimes break of <a id="l553"></a>&amp; become finite, &amp; how it gave me such series is explained in the first <a id="l554"></a>six Propositions of this Book, &amp; I know no other method of finding them. <a id="l555"></a>And therefore I had the Method at that time so far as it is conteined in those six Propositions. In the same Letter I copied also many Ordinates of curves from a Table <a id="l556"></a>in the end of the tenth Proposition &amp; upon the 7<sup>th</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> 9<sup>th</sup> &amp; 10<sup>th</sup> Propo<a id="l557"></a>sitions I wrote to M<sup>r</sup> Collins my Letter of 8 Novem. 1676 printed by M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l558"></a>Iones. And from all this it may be understood that the book was then <a id="l559"></a>in manuscript. And as the notation used in this Book is the oldest, so <a id="l560"></a>it is the  shortest &amp; most expedite, but was not known to the Marquess de l'Hospital when he recom<a id="l561"></a>mended the differential Notation. If it be asked why I did not publish #<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 390v &gt; </span># If it be asked why I did not publish this book sooner, it was <a id="l562"></a>for the same reason that I did not publish the Theory of colours <a id="l563"></a>sooner, &amp; I gave the reason in my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676.</p>
<p id="par48"> ⊡ The first Proposition <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 390v &gt; </span>⊡ The first Proposition of the Book of Quadratures is certainly the foun<a id="l564"></a>dation of the method of fluxions. That Proposition was comprehended verbatim in <a id="l565"></a>the Ænigma by which in my Letter of Octob. 24 1676 I concealed the  foundation of the <a id="l566"></a>Method there spoken of, &amp; therefore that Method there spoken of was the Method of fluxions. In <a id="l567"></a>that Letter I said that I had written a Tract on this Method &amp; the Method of <a id="l568"></a>series together five years before, but did not finish it, nor meddle any more with <a id="l569"></a>these things till the year 1676, being tired with them. And in my Letter of Iune <a id="l570"></a> 13,  1676 I wrote to the same purpose. And this is the Method which I <a id="l571"></a>described in my Letter of Decem 10<sup>th</sup> 1672. In my Analysis per ǽquationes <a id="l572"></a>numero terminorum infinitas, I said of the Method described in that Tract: <a id="l573"></a><em class="underline">Denique ad Analyticam merito pertinere censeatur cujus beneficio Curvarum <a id="l574"></a>areæ et longitudines &amp;c (id modo fiat) exacte et Geometrice determinentur. <a id="l575"></a>Sed ista narrandi non est locus</em>. This relates to Quadratures by Series which in some cases break <a id="l576"></a>off &amp; become finite; as you may understand also by the Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Collins to <a id="l577"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Strode Iuly 26 1672. And therefore before D<sup>r</sup> Barrow sent that Tract <a id="l578"></a>of Analysis to M<sup>r</sup> Collins, that is, before Iuly 1699, I had the method of <a id="l579"></a>fluxions so far at the least as it is conteined in the first six Propositions of <a id="l580"></a>the Book of Quadraturs.</p>
<p id="par49">The Committee of the R. S. said that I had this Method above 15 years before <a id="l581"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz began to publish it.

M<sup>r</sup> Collins wrote that a few months after the Logarithmotechnia of <a id="l592"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Mercator came abroade, [which was in Sept. 1688.] a copy of it being sent to D<sup>r</sup> Barrow at <a id="l593"></a>Cambridge he wrote back that this doctrine of infinite series was invent<a id="l594"></a>ed by  me about two years before the Publication of M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l595"></a>Mercators Logarithmotechnia [that is about Sept. 1686] &amp; generally applied to all Curves &amp; then sent to him  my Manuscript.. And I <a id="l596"></a>see no reason why the testimony of D<sup>r</sup> Barrow  grounded upon what I had communicated to him from time to time, before <a id="l597"></a>the Logarithmotechnia came abroad, should be questioned in this matter. D<sup>r</sup> <a id="l598"></a>Wallis also who flourished in those days &amp; was inquisitive &amp; skilfull, &amp; received <a id="l599"></a>copies of my Letters from M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburgh in the year 1676; published the same <a id="l600"></a>thing in the Preface to the first Volume of his Works without being then <a id="l601"></a>contradicted, saying that in my Letters of Iune 13 &amp; Octob 24 1676 I <a id="l602"></a>explained to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the Method  invented by me ten years before <a id="l603"></a>that time or above. And the testimony of these three ancient knowing <a id="l604"></a>&amp;  credible witnesses may suffice to excuse me for saying <a id="l605"></a>in the Introduction to the book of Quadratures that I found the Method <a id="l606"></a>by degrees in the years 1665 &amp; 1666. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 389v resumes &gt; </span> and M<sup>r</sup> Collins, in <a id="l610"></a>his Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Strode dated 26 Iuly 1672, said that by the Analysis per <a id="l611"></a>Æquationes numero terminorum infinitas &amp; other papers communicated before <a id="l612"></a>to D<sup>r</sup> Barrow it appeared that I had the Method &amp; applied it generally <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p390r"> &lt;390r&gt; </span> some years before the Doctor sent that Analysis to M<sup>r</sup> Collins <a id="l613"></a>that is, some years before Iuly 1669.

<p id="par51">If M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz could have made a good objection against the Commer<a id="l627"></a>cium Epistolicum, he might have done it in a short Letter without writing <a id="l628"></a>another book as big. But this book being matter of fact &amp; unanswerable <a id="l629"></a>he treated it with opprobious language &amp; avoided answering it by several <a id="l630"></a>excuses, &amp; endeavoured to lay it aside by appealing to the judgment of his friend M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli &amp; by writing to his friends at Court, &amp; by running the dispute into a squab<a id="l631"></a>ble about a Vacuum, &amp; Atoms, &amp; universal gravity, &amp; occult qualities, &amp; <a id="l632"></a>Miracles, &amp; the Sensorium of God, &amp; the perfection of the world, &amp; the <a id="l633"></a> nature of time &amp; space, &amp; the solving of Problemes, &amp; the Question <a id="l634"></a>whether he did not find the Differential Method <em class="underline">proprio marte</em>: all <a id="l635"></a>which are nothing to the purpose. M<sup>r</sup> Iames Gregory after a years <a id="l636"></a>study found the method of converging Series proprio marte, but did not <a id="l637"></a>claim it because he had notice  from England that there was such a general method before he searched <a id="l638"></a>for it, &amp; by that notice knew that he was not the first inventor. <em class="underline">Gre<a id="l639"></a>gorius autem</em>, said M<sup>r</sup> Collins, <em class="underline">Newtonum primum ejus inventorem <a id="l640"></a>anticipare haud integrum ducit</em>. The proper Question, <a id="l641"></a> is: Who was the first Inventor? Let it be proved that M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l642"></a>Leibnitz had the Method  before  the year 1677, &amp; then that he had it before he had any notice of it from England, <a id="l643"></a>&amp; then let it be further proved that he had it before the date of <a id="l644"></a>my Letter of Decem. 10<sup>th</sup> 1672,  &amp; before the year 1671 in which  I wrote a tract upon it &amp; before Iuly 1699 &amp;c; &amp;  by these steps if they can be  made the Commercium <a id="l646"></a>Epistolicum will at length begin to be shaken. For the proof lies upon the friends of M<sup>r</sup> Leib.</p>

<p id="par53">But whatever is done, I do not think this business of such conse<a id="l650"></a>quence that I should meddle with it any further. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l651"></a>pretended that I</p>

<p id="par54">Sir</p>
<p id="par55">I have  viewed the printed papers you left in my hands. The remarks <a id="l652"></a>are only upon the Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  dated 9 Apr. 1716. The Letters to <a id="l653"></a>the Comtesse of Kilmansegger &amp; the Postscript to Baron Bothmar are <a id="l654"></a>without an answer, nor do I see that they need any. None of the Letters <a id="l655"></a>were writ to me &amp; I had not answered any of them had not Abbe Conti <a id="l656"></a>pressed me to write an answer to the Postscript of his Letter that  <a id="l657"></a>both might be shewed to the King. And when M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  <a id="l658"></a>sent his Answer  open to Paris  &amp; it came hither from thence <a id="l659"></a> I declined returning an Answer &amp; only drew <a id="l660"></a>up remarks  to satisfy my friends privately that what he writ <a id="l661"></a>was easy to be answered if  he had sent his Letter hither directly.</p>
<p id="par56">In his Letter to  the Countess of Kilmansegger he said that I formerly <a id="l662"></a>applauded his series for the circle, &amp; that it was found afterwards that Grego<a id="l663"></a>ry had found the very same  series, but it was late before he knew this: but the <a id="l664"></a>truth is that he knew this before he sent the Series to me &amp; ought to have let <a id="l665"></a>me known as much. He had before that time received it twice (if not thrice) from England as appears by authentic papers published in the Commercium Epistolicum. page 41, 47, 25. <a id="l666"></a></p>
<p id="par57">In the same Letter he saith that in  my Principles pag 253, 254 I did not <a id="l674"></a>dispute his having found the differential Method by himself. No more <a id="l675"></a>did I ever dispute M<sup>r</sup> Iames Gregories  having found the Method of con<a id="l676"></a>verging series by himself. He had notice from England that there was <a id="l677"></a>such a method &amp; spent a year in searching after it before he <a id="l678"></a>found it, but never laid claim to it because he knew that I had it <a id="l679"></a>before him.  So Collins Epist ad Th. Strode: <em class="underline">D. Gregorius autem D. Newtonum primum ejus In<a id="l680"></a>ventorem anticipare haud integrum</em> ducit. Vide Commerc. Epist. pag. 29.  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz met with D<sup>r</sup> Barrows Lectures at <a id="l683"></a>London in  October 1676, &amp;  M<sup>r</sup> Iames Bernulli &amp; the <a id="l684"></a>Marquess de l'Hospital have represented that where the Doctor left off <a id="l685"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz proceeded, &amp; the Marquess  has told us that the im<a id="l686"></a>provement made by M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz to the Doctors methods lay in shewing <a id="l687"></a>how to  proceed without stopping at fractions &amp; <a id="l688"></a>surds. But the Marquess did not then know that  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l689"></a>had notice of this from me by my Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Collins of 10 Decem. 1672 (a <a id="l690"></a>copy of which M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz received at Paris in Iuly 1676,) &amp; again <a id="l691"></a>by my Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg of 24 Octob 1676 which he saw <a id="l692"></a>at that time in London.   <a id="l693"></a> When M<sup>r</sup> Leibnits published the Elements of the <a id="l694"></a>Differential Method,  he should have told the <a id="l695"></a>world what  notices he had received <a id="l696"></a>from England about  such a method before he found it.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p391v"> &lt;391v&gt; </span> By his concealing  what he knew of these notices <a id="l697"></a>he put me upon a necessity of making some mention of them in the <a id="l698"></a>Book of Principles, &amp; particulary upon representing that I  writ to <a id="l699"></a>him first about this method,  &amp; that I did this ten years before, that is in the year 1676 &amp; that <a id="l701"></a>I then concealed it in setting down this sentence enigmatically Data <a id="l702"></a>æquatione fluentes quotcunque quantitates involvente invenire fluxiones <a id="l703"></a>et vice versa.  the first part of which sentence being the <a id="l704"></a>first Proposition of the Book of Quadratures verbatim, may suffice <a id="l705"></a>to satisfy any man of candor that the Book of Quadratures was then <a id="l706"></a> in Manuscript. Whether M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz found the method by himself <a id="l707"></a>or not was not the Question but whether he was the first inventor.</p>
<p id="par58">In the  Postscript of his Letter to the Count de Bothmar he cites a <a id="l708"></a>passage out of the Acta eruditorum for Ianuary  1705 &amp; there pretends <a id="l709"></a>that the words <em class="underline">semperque adhibuit</em>  are maliciously interpreted by <a id="l710"></a><em class="underline">substituit</em>. For, saith he, those words seen to be put expresly to signify <a id="l711"></a>that  I used fluxions before the publishing of his calculus. And so <a id="l712"></a>they might &amp; yet be truly interpreted by <em class="underline">substituit</em>, unless they be <a id="l713"></a>put expresly to signify that I used fluxions for  the Leibnitian <a id="l714"></a>differences before  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz invented the differential method. But saith <a id="l715"></a>he, between the words semper adhibuit &amp; substituit there is this <a id="l716"></a>difference; the one signifies that M<sup>r</sup> Newton always imployed his <a id="l717"></a>Method, the other that Pere Fabri formed his in imitation of another <a id="l718"></a>In the Introduction to the Book of Quadratures I said that I <a id="l719"></a>found the Method by degrees in the years 1665 &amp; 1666: if he did <a id="l720"></a>grant that the words <em class="underline">semperque adhibuit</em> extend to all times ever <a id="l721"></a>since, he has absolved me from plagiary;  otherwise not, &amp; it lay upon him to prove me guilty. For his <a id="l723"></a>compliment  that I found the method proprio <a id="l724"></a>marte does not  absolve me from the guilt. He that claims an  invention</p>

<p id="par60">In the beginning of the Paragraph M<sup>r</sup> Leibniz is called <a id="l727"></a>the Inventor,  &amp; thence in drawn this conclusion. Pro differentijs <a id="l728"></a>IGITVR Leibnitianis Newtonus adhibet semperque [pro ijsdem <a id="l729"></a>differentijs] adhibuit fluxiones,  — ijsque tum in suis <a id="l730"></a>Principijs Natura Mathematicis tum in alijs postea editis  <a id="l731"></a>[pro differentijs Leibnitianis] eleganter est usus; QVEMADMODVM <a id="l732"></a>et Honoratus Fabrius in sua Synopsi Geometrica, motuum  pro<a id="l733"></a>gressus Cavallerianæ methodo substituit. This is certainly the <a id="l734"></a>true meaning of the words &amp; therefore  they amount to an accusation of plagiary &amp; it lay upon <a id="l737"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz to prove the accusation.</p>
<p id="par61">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz accused the Committee of the R. Society of  partia<a id="l738"></a>lity in omitting every thing which made for him or against me, &amp; offered to <a id="l739"></a>prove this by two instances, but failed in both. He accused them also of  <a id="l740"></a>attaquing his candor by forced interpretations  &amp; here called one <a id="l741"></a>of their interpretations a malicious one but has misiinterpreted the place <a id="l742"></a>himself. And therefore the Commercium Epistolicum remains unshaken. <a id="l743"></a>And untill this is answerd there will be no need of saying any thing <a id="l744"></a>more about this matter. The Committee did not enter into the Question  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p392r"> &lt;392r&gt; </span> whether M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz invented the Method proprio Marte or not.  On <a id="l745"></a>the contrary they said that they  tooke the Question to be not who <a id="l746"></a>invented this or that Method but who was the first inventor of the <a id="l747"></a>Method.  And for proving that I was the first <a id="l750"></a>they appealed to ancient letters &amp; papers. M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli answered that <a id="l751"></a>in those Letters &amp; Papers there were no prickt letters: which is as much <a id="l752"></a>as to say that the Introduction to the book of Quadratures &amp; the Proposition Data æquatione fluentes quotcunque quantitates involvente does not treat <a id="l753"></a>of the method of fluxions because there are no prick lletters in them. <a id="l754"></a>He said also that prict letters did not appear till the third Volume of D<sup>r</sup> Wallis's <a id="l755"></a>works came abroad,   &amp; so he was mistaken in <a id="l756"></a>matter of fact. For the first Proposition of the Book of Quadratures with <a id="l757"></a>the solution  examples in first &amp; second fluxions  was <a id="l758"></a>published almost word for word six years before in the second Volume <a id="l759"></a>of the Doctors works. He said also that I did not understand second <a id="l760"></a>fluxions, &amp; this is as much as to say that he  had not read the first Pro<a id="l761"></a>position of the Book of Quadratures. So then the Commercium Episto<a id="l762"></a>licum remains unshaken.</p>

<p id="par63">I have viewed the printed papers you left in my hands. The <a id="l764"></a>Remarks are only upon the Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz to Mr. l'Abbé Conti dated <a id="l765"></a>9 Apr. 1716. The Letters to the Comtesse of Kilmansegger, &amp; the Postscript <a id="l766"></a>of a Letter to  Compt Bothmar are without an Answer, &amp; I do not see <a id="l767"></a>that they need any. None of his Letters were writ to me, &amp; I had not <a id="l768"></a>answered  any of them had not M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti pressed me to write <a id="l769"></a>an Answer to the Postscript of a Letter to him that both might be shewed <a id="l770"></a>to the King. But  when I understood that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz sent all the <a id="l771"></a>Letters open to Paris, &amp; only wrote the Remarks his Answer came hither from thence, I declined <a id="l772"></a>writing any more Letters, &amp; only wrote the Remarks upon that Answer to <a id="l773"></a>satisfy my friends here that what he writ was easy to have been answered <a id="l774"></a>if it had come hither directly. The Commercium Epistolicum, notwithstanding <a id="l775"></a>any thing which has hitherto been said against it, remains in full <a id="l776"></a>force, &amp; while that remains unshaken there is no need of writing any <a id="l777"></a>further about these matters.</p>
<p id="par64">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz objected against it that in printing the ancient Letters &amp; papers <a id="l778"></a>many things had been omitted which made for him &amp; against me: but in offering <a id="l779"></a>twice to prove this by instances, he failed as often.</p>

<p id="par66">It has been represented that in the Commercium Epistolicum M<sup>r</sup> Leib<a id="l794"></a>nitz is complained of as having published my Method as his own; whereas <a id="l795"></a>he found the Method by himself. But second inventors have no right. Whether <a id="l796"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz found the Method by himself or not is not the Question. The <a id="l797"></a>Committee of the Royal Society did not enter into this Question, but on <a id="l798"></a>the contrary said: <em class="underline">We take the proper Question to be, not who invented <a id="l799"></a>this or that Method but who was the first inventor of the method. And <a id="l800"></a>we beleive that those who have reputed M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the first Inven<a id="l801"></a>tor, knew little or nothing of his correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Collins &amp; <a id="l802"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Oldenbourg long before, nor of M<sup>r</sup> Newton's having the Method <a id="l803"></a>above 15 years before M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz began to publish it in the Acta <a id="l804"></a>eruditorum of Leipsic</em>. Here the Committee of the R.

<p id="par67">By that correspondence he had notice in Iune or Iuly 1676 that I <a id="l809"></a>had a very general method of Analysis which extended to the abstruser sorts <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p394r"> &lt;394r&gt; </span> of Problems in Geometry.✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the top of f 393v &gt; </span>✝ &amp; that the Method of Tangents of Gregory &amp; Slusius was but a <a id="l810"></a>branch or rather a Corollary thereof &amp; that it proceeded without <a id="l811"></a>any troublesome calculation &amp; without sticking at surds.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 394r resumes &gt; </span> &amp; that I had it  &amp;  had interwoven it with the Method of infinite series <a id="l813"></a>before I wrote  my Letter of 10 Decem. 1672 &amp; being tyred with these speculations  had <a id="l814"></a>absteined from them five years when I wrote my Letter of 13 Iune 1676. <a id="l815"></a>&amp; that  The Art of Analysis by these methods became so general as <a id="l816"></a>to reach almost all sorts of Problems except  some numeral <a id="l817"></a>ones like those of Diophantus.</p>
<p id="par68">But all this was not yet sufficient to make him understand the <a id="l818"></a>differential method. For in his Answer dated 13 Aug. 1676, he wrote <a id="l819"></a>back. <em class="underline">Quod dicere videmini plerasque difficultates (exceptis Problemati<a id="l820"></a>bus Diophantæis) ad Series infinitas reduci; id mihi non videtur.

And in the same Letter <a id="l824"></a>he placed the perfection of Analysis in Analytical Tables of Tangents <a id="l825"></a>&amp; the combinatory art: saying of the one, <em class="underline">Nihil est quod norim in <a id="l826"></a>tota Analysi momenti majoris</em>; &amp; of the other, <em class="underline">Ea vero nihil differt <a id="l827"></a>ab Analysi illa suprema, ad cujus intima, quantum  judicare <a id="l828"></a>possum,</em> Cartesius <em class="underline">non pervenit.

<p id="par69">M<sup>r</sup> Iames Bernoulli in the Acta Eruditorum for December 1691 <a id="l830"></a>&amp; the Marquess de l'Hospital in the Introduction to his Analysis represented <a id="l831"></a>that the Differential Method was an improvement of D<sup>r</sup> Barrow's method <a id="l832"></a>of tangents, &amp; the Marquess represented further that the improvement <a id="l833"></a>lay in shewing how to proceed without stopping at surds.

<p id="par70">In October 1676 M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz came to London &amp; there met with <a id="l837"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Barrows Lectures &amp; with my Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburgh dated 24 Oct. <a id="l838"></a>1676, in which the above mentioned notices were repeated &amp; he was also told that the Tract <a id="l839"></a>in which I interwove the two Methods was written five years before, <a id="l840"></a>that is, in the year 1671. And that before the plague which raged in the <a id="l841"></a>year 1665 forced me from the Vniversity, I had found the method of <a id="l842"></a>converging Series ( including redactions by the binomial Rule &amp; by division &amp; extraction <a id="l843"></a>of roots both simple &amp; affected,) so as to be able to deduce the areas of all <a id="l844"></a>figures &amp; the lengths of all curve lines from their Abscissas &amp; Ordinates &amp; <a id="l845"></a>on the contrary to deduce the Abscissas &amp; Ordinates &amp; any other right <a id="l846"></a>lines from the areas &amp; lengths of the Curves.

<p id="par72">I have viewed the printed papers you left in my hands. The <a id="l872"></a>Remarks are only upon the Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz to Abbé Conti dated 9 Apr. 1716. The <a id="l873"></a>Letters to the Comtesse of Kilmansegger &amp; the Postscript of a Letter to <a id="l874"></a>Baron Bothmar are without an Answer, &amp; I do not see that they need <a id="l875"></a>any.  None of  his Letters were writ <a id="l877"></a>to me, &amp; I had not answered any of them had not M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti <a id="l878"></a>pressed me to write an answer to the Postscript of his Letter that both <a id="l879"></a>might be shewed to the King. But when M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz sent his Answer <a id="l880"></a>to mine open to Paris &amp; it came hither from thence I declined  <a id="l881"></a>returning an Answer to it &amp; only drew up the Remarks to satisfy my <a id="l882"></a>friends that what he writ was easy to have been  answered, if it had come <a id="l883"></a>hither directly. The Commercium Epistolicum notwithstanding any thing which has hitherto been written against me remains in full force, &amp; while that remains unshaken there is no need of  writing any thing further.</p>
<p id="par73">  <a id="l884"></a> . M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz indeed objected against it that <a id="l885"></a>in printing the ancient Letters many things had been omitted which made <a id="l886"></a>for him &amp; against me:  &amp; offered to prove this by two instan<a id="l887"></a>ces, but failed in both He  objected also that the  Committee of the <a id="l888"></a>R.

M<sup>r</sup> I. Bernoulli <a id="l902"></a>objected  that when the ancient Letters &amp; Papers were first written I did not <a id="l903"></a>so much as dream of the  method of fluxions because there <a id="l904"></a>are no prickt letters in them : which is much as to say that when I <a id="l905"></a> explained the method of fluxions in the Introduction to the Book of Quadratures I did not so much <a id="l906"></a>as dream of the Method of fluxions because there are no prickt <a id="l907"></a>letters in it, &amp; when I  set down the first Proposition of the <a id="l908"></a>Book of Quadratures enigmatically in my Letter of 24 Octob. <a id="l909"></a>1676 as a tes<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ti<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>mony that the method was founded in the first Proposition of this Book  then in Manuscript, I did not <a id="l910"></a>so much as dream of the Method of fluxions because there are no <a id="l911"></a>prickt letters in the  Ænigma. ③ Or that  in my Letter of 24 <a id="l912"></a>Octob 1676 I did not copy from the Book of Quadratures then in Manu<a id="l913"></a>script the Ordinates of curves which may be compared with the Conic Secti<a id="l914"></a>ons because there are no prickt letters in that Letter. ② Or that my <a id="l915"></a>Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Collins dated 8 Novem. 1676, &amp; published by M<sup>r</sup> Iones <a id="l916"></a>had no relation to the 7<sup>th</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> 9<sup>th</sup> &amp; 10<sup>th</sup> Propositions of the Book of <a id="l917"></a>Quadratures then in Manuscript because there are no prickt letters in <a id="l918"></a>that Letter. ① Or that my saying in my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 that the <a id="l919"></a>series for squaring of Curves which in some cases breaks off &amp; becoms <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p397v"> &lt;397v&gt; </span> finite was invented by the Method whose foundation was comprehend<a id="l920"></a>ed in the said Ænigma that is by the method founded in the first Propo<a id="l921"></a>sition of the book of Quadratures,  was not invented by the <a id="l922"></a>method  founded in the first Proposition &amp;  in five next Propositions of the Book of Q. <a id="l923"></a>then in Manuscript because there are no prickt letters in  <a id="l924"></a>that Letter.  ④ Or that  the Marquess de <a id="l925"></a>l'Hospital was mistaken in saying that the Book of Principles is <a id="l926"></a>full of this Calculus, because there are no prickt letters in it. <a id="l927"></a>Or that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself was mistaken when he wrote to <a id="l928"></a>me, 7 March 1693,  Mirifice ampliaveras Geometriam tuis seriebus, sed Edito Prin<a id="l929"></a>cipiorum opere ostendisti patere tibi  etiam quæ Analysi receptæ <a id="l930"></a>non subsunt. Conatus sum Ego quoque notis commodis adhibitis quæ <a id="l931"></a>differentias et summas exhibent Geometriam illam quam trans<a id="l932"></a>cendentem appello Analysi quodammodo subjicere. M<sup>r</sup> Io. Bernoulli <a id="l933"></a> objected further in these words: Prima vice hæ literæ <a id="l934"></a>punctatæ comparuerunt in tertio volumine Operum Wallisij, multis <a id="l935"></a>annis postquam Calculus differentialis jam ubique locorum invaluisset <a id="l936"></a>, – – Et apparit <a id="l937"></a>Newtono rectam methodum differentiandi differentialia non innotuisse <a id="l938"></a>longo tempore posquam alijs fuisset familiaris. But he erred in <a id="l939"></a>matter of fact. For in the year 1692  at the request of D<sup>r</sup> Wallis I  sent him  the first <a id="l940"></a>Proposition of the book of Quadraturs  with its solutions extending to second third &amp; fourth fluxions &amp;c &amp; <a id="l941"></a>examples  in first &amp; second fluxions, copied almost verbatim <a id="l942"></a>from the book of Quadratures then in Manuscript &amp; the Doctor that <a id="l943"></a>year  in the second Volume of his works <a id="l944"></a>printed what I sent him, &amp; the book came abroad the next year <a id="l945"></a>when the Differential method was but beginning to be in vogue &amp; <a id="l946"></a>three years before the method of finding second third &amp; fourth <a id="l947"></a>differences was published by the Marquess de l'Hospital. So then <a id="l948"></a>the  Commercium Epistolicum stands unshaken against all <a id="l949"></a>Objections which have hitherto been made. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz instead of answering it used his utmost <a id="l950"></a>endeavour to get away from it &amp; to run the dispute into a squabble <a id="l951"></a>about a Vacuum &amp; Atoms &amp; universal gravity &amp; Occult Qualities &amp; miracles &amp; the Sensorium of God &amp; <a id="l952"></a>the absolute perfection of the world &amp;  <a id="l953"></a>the definitions of time &amp; space &amp; the solving of Problemes &amp; the Question whether he did not find the method proprio Marte: all which <a id="l954"></a>are nothing to the purpose. If he could have made a material <a id="l955"></a>objection against the book he might have made it in a short Letter <a id="l956"></a>without writing another Book as big: but for want of such an <a id="l957"></a>Objection, the    Book remains untoucht.</p>
<p id="par74">Whether M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz found the Method by himself or <a id="l958"></a>not was not the Question. The Committee of the R. Society did <a id="l959"></a>not Enter into this Question but on the contrary said: <em class="underline">We take the <a id="l960"></a>proper Question to be not who invented this or that Method but <a id="l961"></a>who was the first Inventor of the Method. And we beleive that <a id="l962"></a>those who have reputed M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the first Inventor knew little <a id="l963"></a>or nothing of his Correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Collins &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Oldenberg <a id="l964"></a>long before nor of M<sup>r</sup> Newton's having the Method above 15 years <a id="l965"></a>before M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz began to publish it in the Acta Eruditorum of <a id="l966"></a>Leipsic</em>. It was the duty of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  in point of candor, when <a id="l967"></a>he published the Elements of the differential method, instead of making them his own to have given <a id="l968"></a>the world some account of his  former correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Collins <a id="l969"></a>&amp; M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg in relation this matter. And the Committee complain <a id="l970"></a>of him for concealing this. By that correspondence he had notice Here the Committee complain of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz for concealing his correspondence with  me &amp; my friends about this method long <a id="l971"></a>before he began to publish it. By that correspondence he had notice that <a id="l972"></a>I had a very general Method of Analysis &amp; that this Analysis procee<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p398r"> &lt;398r&gt; </span>ded without stopping at surds &amp; that it was an improvement of the <a id="l973"></a>method of tangents of Gregory &amp; Slusius, &amp; that the Method of <a id="l974"></a>Tangents of Gregory was an improvement of the Method of tangents <a id="l975"></a>of Barrow, &amp; he knew that the method which  in his Letter of 21 Iune 1677 <a id="l976"></a> he sent back to me was an improvement of D<sup>r</sup> Barrows method of <a id="l977"></a>tangents so as to give the method of Gregory &amp; Slusius &amp; to proceed <a id="l978"></a>without stopping at surds. He  had notice also that my Method gave  me Theorems for squaring of curvilinear figures <a id="l980"></a>by converging series which in some cases brake off off &amp; became finite &amp; one of those Theorems was sent to him; &amp; that it gave me also <a id="l981"></a>Theorems for comparing curvilinear figures with the Conic Sections, &amp; <a id="l982"></a>that my Analysis by the help of Converging æquations was so gene<a id="l983"></a>ral as to extend to almost all Problems except some numeral ones <a id="l984"></a>like those of Diophantus, &amp; that I had this Method when I wrote <a id="l985"></a>my Letter of  10 Decem. 1672, &amp;  wrote a Tract  upon it in <a id="l986"></a>1670. And the Committee of the R.

And their complaint was just</p>
<p id="par75">When M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz came to London the second time he met <a id="l989"></a>with D<sup>r</sup> Barrows Lectures. And M<sup>r</sup> Iames Bernoulli in the Acta Erud. for Dec. 1691 &amp; the Marquess <a id="l990"></a>de l'Hospital in the Introduction to his Analysis  represented that the Differential Method was <a id="l991"></a>an improvement of D<sup>r</sup> Barrows method of Tangents, &amp; the Marquess <a id="l992"></a> represented further that the improvement lay in shewing how to <a id="l993"></a>proceed without stopping at surds: but the Marquess did not then <a id="l994"></a>know that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had notice  of this improvement from mee before he found  it. &amp; the Committe complained of him justly for concealing it. <a id="l995"></a> The Marquess said also that M<sup>r</sup> L. [in the Iournal des Scavans du 30 Aust 1694 <a id="l997"></a>Leibnitz had done me justice in acknowledging that I had found the <a id="l998"></a>method of fluxions proprio marte, but he would not have said so  <a id="l999"></a>if he had known that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had   concealed the  notices which I gave him of  my having  this method before he found it.  </p>

<div><span class="pagenumber" id="p398v"> &lt;398v&gt; </span>
<p id="par77">But M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz pretends that the  words semperque adhibuit imply that I always used the <a id="l1012"></a>method without substituting fluxions for differences.</p>
<p id="par78">It has been said that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz found the method by himself. But this is <a id="l1013"></a>not the Question. The Committee of the R. S.  did not enter into this <a id="l1014"></a>Question, But On the contrary  said</p>
<p id="par79">And yet in the year 1684 he  published it as his own in the year 1686 without making any <a id="l1015"></a>mention of the correspondence which had been between us  about it eight years before, &amp; thereby he put me upon a necessity of mentioning that <a id="l1017"></a>correspondence in the Scholium upon the second Lemma of the second book of <a id="l1018"></a>Principles, &amp; gave just occasion to the Committee of the R. S. to take notice of his <a id="l1019"></a> silence about that correspondence.</p>
<p id="par80">M<sup>r</sup> Ia. Bernoulli — before he found it</p>
<p id="par81">M<sup>r</sup> Collins in the year 1669 sent one of my series to M<sup>r</sup> Ia. Gregory with notice that <a id="l1020"></a>I had a general method of squaring figures by such series; &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Gregory after a years study <a id="l1021"></a>found out the method proprio Marte, but never laid claim to it because by that notice he knew <a id="l1022"></a>that I had it before him &amp; without that notice he had not found it nor serched after it <a id="l1023"></a>Gregorius autem Newtonum primum ejus Inventorem anticipare haud integrum <a id="l1024"></a>ducit. So Collins   to M<sup>r</sup> Strode 26 Iuly 1672. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had much <a id="l1025"></a>more light into the Method of fluxions but  yet laid claim to it  because he <a id="l1026"></a>found it proprio Marte.</p>
<p id="par82">It has been further objected against the Commerc. Epist.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p id="par83">– – – – without writing another book as big.</p>
<p id="par84">He has complained indeed that the book attaques his candor in not <a id="l1027"></a>allowing that he found the method proprio marte. But this was not the <a id="l1028"></a>Question. The Committee of the R. Society did not enter into this question <a id="l1029"></a>but on the contrary said: We take the proper Question to be not who <a id="l1030"></a>invented this or that Method but who was the first inventor of the Method. <a id="l1031"></a>And we beleive – – – – in the Acta Eruditorum of Leipsic. It was the duty <a id="l1032"></a>– – – – – making himself the first Inventor. And their complaint was just.</p>
<p id="par85">When M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz came to London the second time – – – – of this improvement <a id="l1033"></a>from me. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz after all the notices which he had received from <a id="l1034"></a>England  concerning this Method, might find out the rest by himself: for I <a id="l1035"></a>told him in my Letter of 24 Octob 1676 that the foundation of the Method <a id="l1036"></a>was obvious: but his finding it after me gives him no right. And his conceal<a id="l1037"></a>ing all the notices which he had from England of my having the method <a id="l1038"></a>before him in order to give himself a right, put me upon writing the Scholium upon the second Lemma <a id="l1039"></a>of the second Book of Principles to give the world notice of what I wrote <a id="l1040"></a>to him about this method before he found it. So then the complaint of <a id="l1041"></a>the Committee of the R. Society was just &amp; the Commercium Epistolicum <a id="l1042"></a>remains  firm &amp; untoucht.</p>
<p id="par86">M<sup>r</sup>  Collins sent M<sup>r</sup> Iames Gregory one of my series <a id="l1043"></a>with notice that I had a general method of squaring all figures all <a id="l1044"></a>figures by such Series.

Gregorius Acri Studio, said M<sup>r</sup> Collins, eandem acquisivit multum<a id="l1048"></a>que in ea enodanda desudavit. –  Gregorius autem Newtonum, primum <a id="l1049"></a>ejus inventorem anticipare haud integrum ducit.

<p id="par88">Dans ce temps-là M<sup>r</sup> le Chavalier Newton fit imprimer une Version <a id="l1064"></a>Francois de deux Ecrits sur l'invention des Fluxions ou du  Calcul <a id="l1065"></a>differentiel, qu'il avoit oposes a deux Lettres de M<sup>r</sup> Lebniz adressees a M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé <a id="l1066"></a>Conti: Ces 4 petites pieces qui avoient deja eté publieè ici, me parurent tres <a id="l1067"></a>proper a etre ajouteés aux autres. Ie ne doutai point qu'elles ne fussent bien <a id="l1068"></a>recues dans le Pys etrangers, ou l'on n'avoit que des idées confuses de celle <a id="l1069"></a>dispute. M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti gouta fort ce dessein, &amp; pour le rendre plus utile <a id="l1070"></a>il me donna quelques Lettres de M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz qui avoient du rapport avec celles <a id="l1071"></a>dout j'ai parlé, &amp; pouvrient servir d'eclarissement; Vne entr'autres ecrit  à <a id="l1072"></a>Madam de Kielmansegg, ou il faisoit l' histoire de son demêtre avec M<sup>r</sup> Newton; <a id="l1073"></a>&amp; une autre a Mons<sup>r</sup> le Comte de Bothmer qui rouloit sur la meme matiere.

<p id="par89">Mons<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé etant ensuit allé à Paris, au commencement de l'Annee <a id="l1075"></a>1718, il m'envoye par M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Greco plusieurs autres Pieces de M<sup>r</sup> Leibniz <a id="l1076"></a>pour augmenter mon <em class="underline">Recueil</em>; savois, des dissertations &amp; des Lettres a M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l1077"></a>Remond.

<p id="par93">Sir</p>
<p id="par94">You know that when M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti had received a Letter <a id="l1108"></a>from M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz with a large Postscript against me full of accusations <a id="l1109"></a>forreign to the Question, &amp; the Postscript was shewed to the King, &amp; I was <a id="l1110"></a>pressed for  an answer to be also shewed to his Majesty, &amp; the same <a id="l1111"></a>was afterwards sent to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz: he sent it with his Answer to Paris <a id="l1112"></a>declining to make good his charge &amp; pretending that I was the Aggres<a id="l1113"></a>sor, &amp; saying that he sent those Letters to Paris that he might have <a id="l1114"></a>neutral &amp; intelligent witnesses of what passed between us. I looked <a id="l1115"></a>upon this as an indirect practise &amp; forbore writing an Answer in the <a id="l1116"></a>form of a Letter to be sent  to him, &amp; only wrote some Ob<a id="l1117"></a>servations upon his Letter to satisfy my friends here that  it was <a id="l1118"></a>easy to have answered him had I thought fit to let him go on with <a id="l1119"></a>his politicks. As soon as I heard that he was dead I caused the <a id="l1120"></a>Letters &amp; Observations to be printed least they should at any time <a id="l1121"></a>come abroad imperfectly in France. You are now upon a designe <a id="l1122"></a>of reprinting them with some other Letters  written at the same <a id="l1123"></a>time, whose Originals have been left in your hands for that purpose <a id="l1124"></a>by  M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti for making that Controversy complete <a id="l1125"></a>&amp; I see no necessity of adding any thing more to what has been said, <a id="l1126"></a>especially now M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz is dead.</p>
<p id="par95">When he wrote his Letter of 27 Aug. 1676 he placed the <a id="l1127"></a>perfection of Analysis not in the Differential Calculus  as he did afterwards but in a Method founded on Analytical Tables <a id="l1128"></a>of Tangents &amp; the Combinatory Art. <em class="underline">Nihil est</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">quod <a id="l1129"></a>norim in tota Analysi momenti majoris</em>.

M<sup>r</sup> Iames Bernoulli in the Acta Eruditorum for <a id="l1139"></a>Ianuary 1691 pag. 14 said that the Calculus of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was <a id="l1140"></a>founded in that of D<sup>r</sup> Barrow &amp; differed not from it except in the <a id="l1141"></a>notation of Differentials &amp; some compendium of operation. And the <a id="l1142"></a>Marquess de l'Hospital in the Preface to his Analysis of infinite <a id="l1143"></a>petits published A.C. 1696 represented that the improvement which <a id="l1144"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz made to D<sup>r</sup> Barrows Analysis consisted in excluding <a id="l1145"></a> fractions &amp; surds: but he did not then know that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l1146"></a>had notice of this improvement from me by my two Letters above-<a id="l1147"></a>mentioned, dated 10 Decem. 1672 &amp; 24 Octob. 1676.</p>
<p id="par96">I wrote the Book of quadratures in the year 1676, except the In<a id="l1148"></a>troduction &amp; Conclusion; extracting most of it out of old Papers, &amp; when I had <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p402r"> &lt;402r&gt; </span> finished it &amp; the 7<sup>th</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> 9<sup>th</sup> &amp; 10<sup>th</sup> Propositions with their Corollaries  were fresh <a id="l1149"></a>in memory, I wrote upon them to M<sup>r</sup> Collins that Letter which was dated 8 Novem. <a id="l1150"></a>1676 &amp; published by M<sup>r</sup> Iones. The Tables at the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> Proposition <a id="l1151"></a>for squaring of some Curves &amp; comparing others with the Conic Sections, were <a id="l1152"></a>invented by the inverse method of fluxions before the year 1671 as may <a id="l1153"></a>be understood by my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676. And in the same Letter where. I <a id="l1154"></a>represented that the general Theoremes there mentioned for squaring of <a id="l1155"></a>Curves were invented by the Method of fluxions, I meant the direct &amp; in<a id="l1156"></a>verse method described in the first six Propositions of the Book of Quadratures. <a id="l1157"></a>for I know of no other Method by which those Theoremes could be invented. At the <a id="l1158"></a>request of D<sup>r</sup> Wallis I sent to him in two Letters dated 27 Aug. &amp; 17 Sept. 1692, <a id="l1159"></a>the first Proposition of the Book of Quadratures copied almost verbatim from the Book <a id="l1160"></a>&amp; the Method of extracting fluents out of equations involving fluxions mentioned <a id="l1161"></a>in my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 &amp; copied from an older Paper, &amp; the Doctor <a id="l1162"></a>printed them both the same year (viz<sup>t</sup> A.C. 1692) in the second Volume of his <a id="l1163"></a>works, pag. 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, subjoyning an explication of the method <a id="l1164"></a>of fluxions direct &amp; inverse comprehended in the sentence, </p>

<p id="par106">You know that when  M<sup>r</sup> l'Abbé Conti had received a Letter <a id="l1240"></a>from M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz with a large  Postscript against me  full of accusations <span class="ns">☉</span><span class="ns">☉</span> forreign to the question &amp; the Postscrip was shewed to <a id="l1241"></a> the King, &amp;  I was pressed to write <a id="l1242"></a>an answer to  be also shewed to the <a id="l1243"></a>King, &amp; the same  was afterwards sent to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz he sent it with his <a id="l1244"></a>Answer to Paris declining to make good his charge &amp; pretending that I  was the Aggressor &amp; <a id="l1245"></a>saying that he sent those Letters to Paris that he might have impartial <a id="l1246"></a>witnesses of what passed between us! I looked upon this as an indirect practise <a id="l1247"></a>&amp; forbore writing an Answer in the form of a Letter to be sent to <a id="l1248"></a>him &amp; only wrote some Observations upon his Letter to  satisfy my friends here that  <a id="l1250"></a>it was easy to  have answer  him, had I thought fit to let him <a id="l1251"></a>go on with his polyticks. As soon as I heard that he was dead I caused <a id="l1252"></a> the Letters &amp; Observations to be printed least they should at <a id="l1253"></a>any time hereafter come abroad  imperfectly in France.  <a id="l1254"></a> You are now upon a designe of reprinting them with some other <a id="l1255"></a>Letters whose originals have been left in your hands  for that <a id="l1256"></a>purpose by  M<sup>r</sup> L'Abbé Conti,   but I see no reason why I should meddle with this dispute any furth<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>er<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>, especially <a id="l1258"></a>now  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz is dead.  For I have always indoustriously avoided <a id="l1259"></a> disputes. </p>
<p id="par107">② I wrote the Book of Quadratures in the year 1676, except the <a id="l1261"></a>Introduction &amp; Conclusion; extracting most of it out of old Papers,  <a id="l1262"></a>when I had finished the seventh eighth ninth &amp; tenth Propositions with  their Corollaries &amp; <a id="l1263"></a>they were fresh in memory, I wrote upon them to M<sup>r</sup> Collins that Letter which <a id="l1264"></a>was dated 8 November 1676 &amp; published by M<sup>r</sup> Iones. The <a id="l1265"></a>Tables at the end of  the tenth Proposition for squaring of some Curves &amp; <a id="l1266"></a>comparing others with the Conic Sections, were invented by the Inverse <a id="l1267"></a>Method of Fluxions before the year 1671 as may be understood by <a id="l1268"></a>my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676. And in the same Letter where I re<a id="l1269"></a>presented that the general Theoremes there mentioned for squaring <a id="l1270"></a>of Curves were invented by the Method of fluxions, I meant the <a id="l1271"></a>direct &amp; inverse Method described in the first six Propositions of the Book of Quadra<a id="l1272"></a>tures: for I know of no other Method by which those Theoremes <a id="l1273"></a>could be invented. At the request of D<sup>r</sup> Wallis I sent to him, <a id="l1274"></a>in two Letters dated 27 Aug. &amp; 17 Sept 1692, the first Proposi<a id="l1275"></a>tion of the Book of Quadratures copied almost verbatim from the <a id="l1276"></a>Book, &amp; the Method of extracting fluents out of Equations involving <a id="l1277"></a>fluxions mentioned in my Letter of 24 Octob 1676 &amp; copied from an <a id="l1278"></a>older Paper, &amp; the Doctor printed them both the same year (viz<sup>t</sup> <a id="l1279"></a>A.C. 1692) in the second Volume of his works pag. 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, subjoyning an explication of the method of <a id="l1280"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>fl<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>uxions direct &amp; inverse comprehended in the sentence <em class="underline">Data</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p405r"> &lt;405r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">æquatione fluentes quotcunque quantitates involvente, invenire fluxio<a id="l1281"></a>nes, et vice versa</em>.  This Volume came abroad in the year 1693 <a id="l1282"></a>two years before the first Volume. And this is a demonstration that <a id="l1283"></a>in those days I used prickt letters &amp; understood second &amp; third fluxions. When <a id="l1284"></a>I considered only first fluxions I seldome used letters with pricks, but <a id="l1285"></a>when I considered also second third &amp; fourth fluxions I distinguished them <a id="l1286"></a>by Letters with one two three or more pricks. And for fluents I put the <a id="l1287"></a>fluxion either included in a square or with a square prefixed or <a id="l1288"></a>with an oblique line upon it. <sup>✝</sup> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 404v &gt; </span>✝ And these notations are the best yet extant, but were not known to the <a id="l1289"></a>Marquess de l'Hospital when he recommended the differential notation, <a id="l1290"></a>nor are necessary to the Method.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 405r resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par108">③ By the inverse method of fluxions I found in the year <a id="l1291"></a>1677 the Demonstration of Keplers Astronomical Proposition viz<sup>t</sup> that <a id="l1292"></a>the Planets move in Ellipses, which is the Eleventh Propopsition of the <a id="l1293"></a>Book of Principles; &amp; in the year 1683 at the importunity of <a id="l1294"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Hally I resumed the consideration thereof &amp; added some <a id="l1295"></a>more Propositions about the motions of the heavenly bodies which <a id="l1296"></a>were by him communicated to the R. Society &amp; entred in their <a id="l1297"></a>Letter-Book the winter following, &amp; upon their request that those things <a id="l1298"></a>might be published, I wrote the Book of Principles in the years <a id="l1299"></a>1684, 1685, 1686, &amp; in writing it, made much use of the method <a id="l1300"></a>of fluxions direct &amp; inverse, but did not set down the calcu<a id="l1301"></a>lations in the Book it self because the book was written by the <a id="l1302"></a>method of Composition, as all Geometry ought to be. [And ever <a id="l1303"></a>since I wrote that Book I have been forgetting the Methods <a id="l1304"></a>by which I wrote it.]</p>
<p id="par109">If it be asked why I did not publish the Book of Qua<a id="l1305"></a>dratures before the year  1704, I answer; For the same <a id="l1306"></a>reason that I did not publish the Theory of colours before <a id="l1307"></a>that year. I found that Theory in the beginning of the year <a id="l1308"></a>1666, &amp; in the year 1671 was upon a designe of publishing <a id="l1309"></a>it together with the Method of Series &amp; Fluxions, but the next year <a id="l1310"></a>for a reason given in my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 I first <a id="l1311"></a>suspended &amp; then left off my designe of publishing them till <a id="l1312"></a>the year  1704. And for the same reason I  I am very averse fro meddling <a id="l1313"></a>with these matters any further.</p>
<p id="par110">✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 404v &gt; </span><sup>✝</sup> ① When M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz wrote his Letter of 27 Aug. 1676 he placed the <a id="l1314"></a>perfection of Analysis in a Method founded on Analytical Tables of <a id="l1315"></a>Tangents &amp; the Combinatory Art. <em class="underline">Nihil est</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">quod morim  in <a id="l1316"></a>tota Analysi momenti majoris</em>.

And <a id="l1328"></a>the Marquess de l'Hospital in the Preface to  his  Analysis des <a id="l1329"></a>infinitement petits published A.C. 1696 represented that the improve<a id="l1330"></a>ment which M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz made to D<sup>r</sup> Barrows Analysis consisted in <a id="l1331"></a>excluding fractions &amp; surds,   but he did not then know that <a id="l1332"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had notice of this improvement  from me by my two Letters above mentioned.. <a id="l1333"></a></p>

<p id="par111">I have read over the printed Letters which you have put into <a id="l1335"></a>my hands, &amp; since Seignior l'Abby Conti found means to engage me in <a id="l1336"></a> writing part of them, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  in his Letter to  <a id="l1337"></a>Madam la Comtess de Kilmansegger pag. 34 &amp; 35 has told his own story at large I <a id="l1338"></a>give you leave to publish also  <a id="l1339"></a> what I take to be matter of fact.</p>
<p id="par112">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was in London in the beginning of the year 1673 <a id="l1340"></a>&amp;  went thence   in or about March to Paris  carrying Mercators Logarithmotechnia along with him. At Paris he <a id="l1341"></a>kept a correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg about Arithmetical matters <a id="l1342"></a>till Iune being not yet acquainted with the higher Geometry.  [The <a id="l1343"></a>Horologium oscillatorium of M<sup>r</sup> Huygens  was published in April <a id="l1344"></a>1673 &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz] but  about that time he began to study it being <a id="l1345"></a>entred into it by M<sup>r</sup> Huygens, &amp; begining with his Horologium oscillatorium which was published in April  1673. And the next <a id="l1347"></a>year he renewed his correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg by two letters <a id="l1348"></a>dated 15 Iuly &amp; 26 Octob. representing that as the Lord Brounker &amp; <a id="l1349"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Mercator had found an infinite series of rational numbers equal <a id="l1350"></a>to the area of the Hyperbola so he had done the like for the circle <a id="l1351"></a>&amp; added that by the same method the arch of a circle might be <a id="l1352"></a>found whose sine was given tho the proportion of the arch to the whole circum<a id="l1353"></a>ference was not known. Thereupon M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg in letter dated <a id="l1354"></a>15 Apr. 1675 sent to him from M<sup>r</sup> Collins several series invented <a id="l1355"></a>by me &amp; Gregory  four of which were for finding the Arc <a id="l1356"></a>whose sine or tangent was given &amp; the sine or tangent whose Arc <a id="l1357"></a>was given. And M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Answer dated 20 May 1675. <a id="l1358"></a>acknowledged the receipt of this Letter. And the next year in <a id="l1359"></a>a Letter dated May 12 he  commended the two series above mentioned for <a id="l1360"></a>finding the arc whose sine was given &amp; the sine whose arc was <a id="l1361"></a>given as very ingenious especially the latter which had a singular <a id="l1362"></a>elegance &amp; desired M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg to procure from M<sup>r</sup> Collins  <a id="l1363"></a>the Demonstration thereof, that is the Method of finding it. <a id="l1364"></a>And in recompence for the same, he promised to send his own medi<a id="l1365"></a>tations upon the same subject, the demonstration whereof he <a id="l1366"></a>was then polishing for that purpose. But M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg &amp; M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l1367"></a>Collins wrote earnestly to me to send to  him my method <a id="l1368"></a>&amp; after much sollicitation I wrote my Letter of 13 Iune 1676</p>
<p id="par113">M<sup>r</sup> Gregory died in the end of the year 1675, &amp; at <a id="l1369"></a>the request of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz M<sup>r</sup> Collins collected his Letters <a id="l1370"></a>&amp; Papers &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg sent the Collection to Paris at <a id="l1371"></a>the same time with my Letter.

<p id="par115">I have read over the printed Letters which you have put <a id="l1391"></a>into my hands.  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Letter to Madam <a id="l1392"></a>la Comtesse de Kilmansegger pag 34 &amp; 35 transcribes the Scho<a id="l1393"></a>lium upon the 2<sup>d</sup> Lemma of the second Book of my Princi<a id="l1394"></a>ples &amp; then adds: <em class="underline">Ainsi, M<sup>r</sup> Newton ne me contesta point <a id="l1395"></a>d'avoir trouvé le chose de mon chef</em>.    And by this argument he has constantly pretended that in this  <a id="l1397"></a>Scholium I granted him the method. But whether he found the <a id="l1398"></a>method by himself or not  was not the Question. The true Question <a id="l1399"></a>was whether he was the first inventor or not, &amp; this Question he  has <a id="l1400"></a>constantly endeavoured to avoid chusing rather to put the issue upon the Question <a id="l1402"></a>whether he invented it by himself or not, as if it must be his <a id="l1403"></a>if he invented it by himself though he was not the first inventor. <a id="l1404"></a>He has often allowed that I invented the method by my self: but <a id="l1405"></a>he never would allow that I was the first inventor. And the <a id="l1406"></a>designe of that Scholium was to prove that  I was the <a id="l1407"></a>first that discovered that I had the Method. And it proves it <a id="l1408"></a>by this argument, that I wrote of the Method to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l1409"></a>before he wrote of it to me in the year 1677.

<p id="par145">I understand by your letter to M<sup>r</sup> Moiver that M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli complains of me for <a id="l1652"></a>calling him  a Mathematician or pretended Mathematician &amp; <em class="underline">homo novus &amp; rerum <a id="l1653"></a>anteactarum parum peritus</em> &amp; a Knight errant.  And yet by the first I meant only <a id="l1654"></a> to call him the author or pretended author of the judgment published in the <a id="l1655"></a>flying paper &amp; said to be  written by a great mathematician And this was in his favour: For he <a id="l1656"></a>has since declared that he was not the author. If he was the Iudge then the Iudge was in a conspiracy with M<sup>r</sup> L. to be carried on against D<sup>r</sup> Keill &amp; the Committee of the R. S. by concealing the name of the judge, for two years together: And by calling M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli the pretended Iudge I absolved M<sup>r</sup> B. from being in such a conspiracy And by the second I meant that he was <a id="l1657"></a>risen up since the days of M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg &amp; unacquainted  with the transactions of those <a id="l1658"></a>days, as M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz objected against D<sup>r</sup> Keill. And by the third I meant only to  correct <a id="l1659"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz for  referring the matter in question to a <a id="l1660"></a> duell or battel instead of deciding it by  reason &amp; old records, &amp; making M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli <a id="l1661"></a>at one &amp; the same time an impartial judge between the two parties &amp;  a partiman in whose name he sent a challenge to the <a id="l1663"></a>English Mathematicians. M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli's Problem was published in Leipsic Acts for May <a id="l1664"></a>1697 p. 211. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  in the year 1700 challenged M<sup>r</sup> Fatio to solve this Probleme. It reflects  <a id="l1665"></a>upon M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  (not upon M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli) for appealing from the evidence <a id="l1666"></a>which M<sup>r</sup> Fatio offered to a Mathematicall Duell, &amp; thereby treating M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli as a Hero or <a id="l1667"></a>Don Quixot in Mathematicks. And the same thing M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz repeated by  <a id="l1668"></a>challenging the English Mathematicians to solve the same Probleme</p>
