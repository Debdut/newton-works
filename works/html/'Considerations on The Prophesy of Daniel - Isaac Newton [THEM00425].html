            <h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Considerations on <a id="l1"></a><br>The Prophesy of Daniel concerning the Messiah . I Romme</h2> 
            <p id="par1">By the Babylonian captivity, the kingdom of Iudah was dissolved &amp; the <a id="l2"></a>Iews ceased to be a body politick, &amp; continued in this condition till the seventh <a id="l3"></a>year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, who then sent Ezra with a commission <a id="l4"></a>to restore the worship of God in the second Temple lately built by the command<a id="l5"></a>ment of Cyrus &amp; Darius Hystaspis, &amp; to set up Magistrates &amp; Iudges that might <a id="l6"></a>judge all the people &amp; teach them  the laws of God &amp; punish offenders <a id="l7"></a>against the Laws of God &amp; the King  with death or banishment or con<a id="l8"></a>fiscation of goods or imprisonment. This was done Anno Nabonass. 290. And hereby the people of God became <a id="l9"></a>again a body politick called by Daniel a people &amp; a holy city, &amp; continued so till the death of Christ which was 490 years after.</p>
            <p id="par2">In the first year of the reign of Darius the Mede the son of Achsuerus (that is the son of Achseres, Axeres or <a id="l10"></a>Cy – Axeres) over Babylon, [Ann Nabonass. 2<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>6<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the Angel Gabriel appeared to Daniel &amp; said to him <a id="l11"></a>Seventy weeks are allotted upon thy people &amp; upon thy holy city [such weeks as Laban <a id="l12"></a>spake of when he said to Iacob, Fulfill her week] to finish the transgression <a id="l13"></a>&amp; to make an end of sins &amp; to make reconciliation for iniquity, &amp; to seale up <a id="l14"></a>the vision &amp; prophesy, &amp; to annoint the most Holy. [All which was done by the <a id="l15"></a>death &amp; resurrection of Christ Anno Nabonass 780.]</p>
            <p id="par3">Know also &amp; understand that from the going forth of the commandment <a id="l16"></a>[at the end of the long captivity] to restore &amp; to build Ierusalem unto [the <a id="l17"></a>coming of him that was annointed] the Messiah the Prince [to reign over it] shall be seven weeks.</p>
            <p id="par4"><em class="underline">Also threescore &amp; two weeks [or 434 years]   the city shall be built &amp; the wall</em> <a id="l18"></a>[ unto his coming viz<sup>t</sup> [ from the 28<sup>th</sup> of Artaxerxes Longimanus  unto his birth]  <em class="underline">but this</em> [not unto his coming <a id="l20"></a>in glory to reign  as at the end of the seven weeks , but] <em class="underline">in troublesome times. And after the threescore &amp; two weeks the <a id="l21"></a>Messiah shall</em> [not reign as Prince but] <em class="underline">be cut off, &amp; they</em> [shall] <em class="underline">not</em> [be] <em class="underline">his [people.] And the people of a Prince <a id="l22"></a>that shall come</em> [the Romans] <em class="underline">shall destroy the City &amp; the sanctuary, &amp; the end <a id="l23"></a>thereof shall be with a flood, &amp; unto the end of the war desolations are deter<a id="l24"></a>mined. Yet</em> [before they cease to be his people,] <em class="underline">he shall keep the covenant with <a id="l25"></a>many for one week</em> [viz<sup>t</sup> untill the calling of Cornelius &amp; the gentiles which was <a id="l26"></a>seven years after he was cut off] <em class="underline">&amp;</em> [after that] <em class="underline">in half a week he shall</em> <a id="l27"></a> [by the aforesaid war under Nero &amp; Vespatian] <em class="underline">cause the sacrifice &amp; oblation to <a id="l28"></a>cease, &amp;</em> [further in the reign of Adrian ] <em class="underline">with the overspreading of  abominations <a id="l29"></a>he shall</em>  overflow &amp; fill the land, &amp;] <em class="underline">make it desolate</em> [of its old inhabitants,] <em class="underline">even untill the <a id="l30"></a>consummation</em> [of the times of  desolation] <em class="underline">&amp; </em> [untill all] <em class="underline">that which is determined  <a id="l31"></a>shall be poured upon the desolate,</em> [&amp;   untill the commandment go forth to  cause <a id="l32"></a>the captivity to return, &amp; to restore &amp; to build Ierusalem the city of the great king. And from the going <a id="l33"></a>forth of this commandment unto the coming of the Messiah the Prince &amp; unto the coming <a id="l34"></a>of his kingdom  shall be seven weeks of years, as was prefigured <a id="l35"></a>by Moses  in the Iubile which he instituted at the end of  seven <a id="l36"></a>weeks of years.</p>
            <p id="par5"> The  prophetic Angel  in the third year of Cyrus  predicted <a id="l37"></a>to Daniel a perpetual series of events down from those days to the great tribulation &amp; the resurrection <a id="l38"></a>of the dead (Dan XI &amp; XII; &amp; then added that when God should have accomplished to scatter the power <a id="l39"></a>of the holy people, all those things should be finished: &amp; Daniel said that he understood <a id="l40"></a>not &amp; asked the Angel what should be the end of these things? And the Angel <a id="l41"></a>answered that the words were closed up &amp; sealed till the time of the end. –– <a id="l42"></a>And <em class="underline">from the time that the dayly sacrifice shall be taken away to set up the <a id="l43"></a>abomination which maketh desolate</em> [untill God shall have finished to scatter <a id="l44"></a>the power of the holy people] <em class="underline">there shall be a thousand two hundred &amp; <a id="l45"></a>ninety days. Blessed is he that waiteth &amp; cometh to the thousand three hundred &amp; <a id="l46"></a>five &amp; thirty days. But go thy way Daniel for thou shall rest</em>  <em class="underline">&amp; stand in thy lot </em> [amongst those that awake out of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span> dust] <em class="underline">at the end of the days.</em> So then God will have finished to scatter the <a id="l48"></a>power of the holy people forty &amp; five  days before the resurrection <a id="l49"></a>of the dead &amp; the coming of Christ to judgment;  that is forty &amp; five <a id="l50"></a>years: for all Daniels days are years. And if four years be allowed for <a id="l51"></a>the people to return from their captivity after the going forth of the com<a id="l52"></a>mandment to cause them to restore &amp; to  build Ierusalem: this command<a id="l53"></a>ment will go forth 49 years before the  coming of the Messiah to reign <a id="l54"></a>as Prince, for which end he was annointed  at <a id="l55"></a>his first coming. And thus , this Prophesy will reach to the  day of judgment like all the rest of Daniels Prophesies.</p>
            <sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>
            <p id="par6">According to the vulgar interpretation nothing is predicted in this prophesy <a id="l56"></a>but the death of Christ &amp; destruction of Ierusalem, nothing of moment is done <a id="l57"></a>at the end of the seven weeks or at either the beginning or end of the 62 weeks <a id="l58"></a>or at  the beginning of the week; Christ is annointed to reign but nothing <a id="l59"></a>is said of his coming to reign or of his kingdom; &amp; the week ends a week before <a id="l60"></a>God ceased to keep his covenant with the nation of the Iews. According to the <a id="l61"></a>interpretation here proposed, every period of time beginns &amp; ends with something <a id="l62"></a>of great moment; the birth &amp; death of Christ, the calling of the Gentiles, the destru<a id="l63"></a>ction of  Ierusalem &amp; the Temple, the  bloody warrs by which the Iews were <a id="l64"></a>wonderfully slaughtered &amp; banished from Iudea &amp; their land given entirely to <a id="l65"></a>the Gentiles, &amp; the return of the Iews from their long captivity, &amp; the coming of <a id="l66"></a>Christ to reign &amp; judge the world, for which end he was annointed; are all of them <a id="l67"></a>predicted. The prophesy of the seventy weeks is already confirmed by the event. That <a id="l68"></a>of the seven weeks is here proposed not as a certainty, but by way of enquiry <a id="l69"></a>untill it shall be either confirmed corrected or confuted by the event. <span class="ns">☉</span></p>

            <p id="par13">All  Daniels Prophesies reach to the day of judgment &amp; consist <a id="l115"></a>of two parts,  a  Prophesy &amp;   a supplement for making the Pr. more full &amp; plane. And so doth the Apo<a id="l116"></a>calyps. And why should not this of the Messiah be like the rest. The  Prophesy is  of the <a id="l117"></a>Messiah's coming first to be annointed at the end of the seventy weeks &amp; then to reign at the <a id="l118"></a>end of the seven weeks. And the  supplemental explanation is to distinguish between the two comings <a id="l119"></a>by the periods of the sixty two weeks, the week &amp; the half week &amp; the ensuing <a id="l120"></a>desolation of the land  untill the consumation thereof &amp; untill all that which <a id="l121"></a>is determined be poured upon the desolate people of the Iews; that is, untill the <a id="l122"></a>commandment go forth to put an end to the desolation by causing the desolate <a id="l123"></a>to return home &amp; to restore &amp; to build Ierusalem. </p>

                <p id="par32">The prophetic Angel in the third year of Cyrus predicted to Daniel <a id="l296"></a>a perpetual series of events down to the great tribulation &amp; the resur<a id="l297"></a>rection of the dead, (Dan XI &amp;  XII,) &amp; added that <em class="underline">when God should have <a id="l298"></a>accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all those things <a id="l299"></a>should be finished</em>; &amp; Daniel said that he understood not &amp; asked the <a id="l300"></a>Angel what should be the end of those things. And the Angel answered <a id="l301"></a>that the words were <em class="underline">closed up &amp; sealed to the time of the end.</em> And <a id="l302"></a><em class="underline">from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away to set up the <a id="l303"></a>abomination which maketh desolate</em> [untill the end when God shall have finished to scatter <a id="l304"></a>the power of the holy people] <em class="underline">there shall be a thousand two hundred &amp; <a id="l305"></a>ninety days. Blessed is he that waiteth &amp; cometh to the thousand three hun<a id="l306"></a>dred &amp; five &amp; thirty days. But go thou thy way Daniel, for thou shalt <a id="l307"></a>rest &amp; stand in thy lot</em> [amongst those that awake out of the dust] <em class="underline">at the <a id="l308"></a>end of the days.</em> So then God will have finished to scatter the power of the <a id="l309"></a>holy people forty &amp; five days before the resurrection of the dead &amp; the coming <a id="l310"></a>of Christ to judgment; that is forty &amp; five years. For all Daniels days are <a id="l311"></a>years. And if four years be allowed for the people to return from their <a id="l312"></a>captivity after  the going forth of the commandment to cause them to restore <a id="l313"></a>&amp; to build Ierusalem: this commandment will go forth 49 years before <a id="l314"></a>the coming of the Messiah to reign as Prince, for which end he was annointed <a id="l315"></a>at his first coming. And thus this Prophesy will reach to the day of judg<a id="l316"></a>ment like the rest of Daniels prophesies.</p>
                <p id="par33">All Daniel's prophesies consist of two parts, a prophesy &amp; a supplement <a id="l317"></a>for making the prophesy more full &amp; plane. And so doth the Apocalyps. <a id="l318"></a>And why should not this of the Messiah be like the rest? The prophesy is <a id="l319"></a>of the double coming of the Messiah; his coming first to be annointed at <a id="l320"></a>the end of the seventy weeks, &amp;  next to reign at the end of the seven <a id="l321"></a>weeks. And the supplemental explanation is to distinguish between the <a id="l322"></a>two comings by the periods of the sixty two weeks, the week &amp; the half <a id="l323"></a>week, &amp; the ensuing desolation of the land untill the consummation thereof <a id="l324"></a>&amp; untill all that which is determined to be poured upon the desolate people <a id="l325"></a>of the Iews; that is untill the commandment go forth to put an end to <a id="l326"></a>the desolation by causing the desolate to return home &amp; to restore &amp; to <a id="l327"></a>build Ierusalem.</p>

                <p id="par37">By the Babylonian captivity the kingdom of Iudea was dissolved <a id="l406"></a>&amp; the Iews ceased to be a body politick &amp; continued in this condition <a id="l407"></a>till the seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, who then sent <a id="l408"></a>Ezra with many Iews &amp; a commission to restore the worship of God in the second <a id="l409"></a>Temple, &amp; to <em class="underline">set up Magistrates &amp; Iudges who might judge all the people <a id="l410"></a>&amp; teach them the laws of God, &amp; punish offenders against the laws of <a id="l411"></a>God &amp; the king with death or banishment or confiscation of Goods or im<a id="l412"></a>prisonment</em>. This was done Anno Nabonass. 290. And hereby the <a id="l413"></a>people of God became again a people &amp; a holy city. But the people <a id="l414"></a>of the land still troubled them &amp; wrote a letter to Artaxerxes that <a id="l415"></a>the Iews who came up from him were building the city Ierusalem <a id="l416"></a>&amp; setting up the walls thereof, &amp; that if this were done they would <a id="l417"></a>revolt. Whereupon the king gave order that the city should not <a id="l418"></a>be built till another commandment  should be given from him <a id="l419"></a>Ezra. IV.7, 12, 13, 16, 21.</p>
                <p id="par38">Then Nehemiah hearing that the Iews were in affliction, &amp; <a id="l420"></a>that the wall of Ierusalem was broken down, became sorrowfull. <a id="l421"></a>And the king asking him why he was sad, he replied, because the <a id="l422"></a>city of his fathers sepulchres lay wast, &amp; the gates thereof were <a id="l423"></a>burnt. And thereupon he obteined leave of the king to go unto Iudea <a id="l424"></a>&amp; build the city Nehem. I.3, &amp; II.2, 3, 5. And in the 28<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l425"></a>of the King, according to Iosephus, (Anno Nabonass. 311) the wall of <a id="l426"></a>the city was finished &amp; the gates set up by Nehemiah. And thence <a id="l427"></a>forward the Gates were kept, &amp; the Rulers dwelt in Ierusalem, &amp; the <a id="l428"></a>rest of the people cast lots to bring one in ten to dwell at Ierusalem <a id="l429"></a>&amp; nine parts in the other cities Nehem VII.10 &amp; XI.1. And in the two <a id="l430"></a>&amp; thirtith year of this king Nehemiah went back from Ierusalem <a id="l431"></a>into Persia &amp; after certain days returned &amp; continued governour <a id="l432"></a>of Iudea till the reign of  Darius Nothus. Nehem. XII.2. And <a id="l433"></a>thenceforward Ierusalem &amp; Iudea were peopled by the Iews till the <a id="l434"></a>Romans expelled them.</p>
                <p id="par39">Now in the first year of the reign of Darius the Mede the son of <a id="l435"></a>Ahasuerus over Babylon, the Angel Gabriel appeared to Daniel &amp; said to <a id="l436"></a>him: Seventy weeks are allotted upon thy people &amp; upon thy holy city <a id="l437"></a>[such weeks as Laban spake of when he said to Iacob, Fulfill her <a id="l438"></a>week,] to finish transgression &amp; make an end of sins, &amp; to make a <a id="l439"></a>reconciliation for iniquity &amp; to seal up the vision &amp; the prophesy, &amp; to <a id="l440"></a>annoint the most Holy. All which came to pass by the death &amp; resur<a id="l441"></a>rection of Iesus Christ, Anno Nabonass. 780, that is 490 years after <a id="l442"></a>the government of the Iews was set up in Iudea by the commission <a id="l443"></a>of Artaxerxes to Ezra, as above.</p>

                <p id="par42">The prophetic Angel in the third year of Cyrus predicted to <a id="l469"></a>Daniel a perpetual series of events down to the great tribulation <a id="l470"></a>&amp; the resurrection of the dead (Dan. XI &amp; XII,) &amp; added that <em class="underline">when <a id="l471"></a>God should have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people <a id="l472"></a>all those things should be finished</em>; &amp; Daniel said that he under<a id="l473"></a>stood not &amp; asked the Angel what should be the end of those things. <a id="l474"></a>And the Angel answered that the words were <em class="underline">closed up &amp; sealed to <a id="l475"></a>the time of the end. And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall <a id="l476"></a>be taken away to set up the abomination which maketh desolate</em> [<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>until<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>untill<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l477"></a>the end when God shall finished to scatter the power of the holy <a id="l478"></a>people] <em class="underline">there shall be a thousand two hundred &amp; ninety days. <a id="l479"></a>Blessed is he that waiteth &amp; cometh to the thousand three hundred <a id="l480"></a>&amp; five and thirty days. But go thou thy way Daniel for thou shalt <a id="l481"></a>rest, &amp; stand in thy lot</em> [amongst those that awake out of the dust] <a id="l482"></a><em class="underline">at the end of the days.</em> So then God will have finished to scatter <a id="l483"></a>the power of the holy people forty &amp; five days before the resurrec<a id="l484"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>tion<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of the dead &amp; the coming of Christ to judgment; that is, forty &amp; <a id="l485"></a>five years. For all Daniel's days are years. And if four years be <a id="l486"></a>allowed for the people to return out of all nations from their <a id="l487"></a>captivity after the going forth of the commandment to cause them <a id="l488"></a>to restore &amp; build Ierusalem: this commandment will go forth <a id="l489"></a>49 years before the coming of the Messiah to reign as Prince, <a id="l490"></a>for which end he was annointed at his first coming. And thus this <a id="l491"></a>Prophesy will reach to the day of judgment like all the rest of <a id="l492"></a>Daniel's prophesies.</p>
                <p id="par43">All Daniels prophesies consist of two parts, a prophesy &amp; a <a id="l493"></a>supplement for making the prophesy more full &amp; plane. And so doth <a id="l494"></a>the Apocalyps. And why should not this of the Messiah be like the rest? <a id="l495"></a>The prophesy is of the double coming of the Messiah: his coming first to be <a id="l496"></a>annointed at the end of the seventy weeks, &amp; then to reign at the end of the <a id="l497"></a>seven weeks. And the supplemental explanation is to distinguish between <a id="l498"></a>the two comings by the periods of the sixty two weeks the week &amp; the <a id="l499"></a>half week &amp; the ensuing desolation of the land untill the consumation <a id="l500"></a>thereof, &amp; untill all that which is determined be poured upon the deso<a id="l501"></a>late people of the Iews; that is, untill the commandment go forth to put an <a id="l502"></a>end to the desolation  &amp; to restore &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007v"> &lt;7v&gt; </span> to build Ierusalem</p>
                <p id="par44">According to the vulgar interpretations nothing is predicted <a id="l503"></a>in this Prophesy but the death of Christ &amp; destruction of Ierusalem, <a id="l504"></a>nothing of moment is done at the end of the seven, or at either the <a id="l505"></a>beginning or end of the 62 weeks, or at the beginning of the week; <a id="l506"></a>Christ is annointed to reign but nothing is said of his coming to reign <a id="l507"></a>or of his kingdom, &amp; the week ends a week before God ceased to <a id="l508"></a>keep his covenant with the nation of the Iews. According to the in<a id="l509"></a>terpretation here proposed every period of time begins &amp; ends <a id="l510"></a>with something of great moment. The birth &amp; death of Christ, the <a id="l511"></a> calling of the Gentiles, the destruction of Ierusalem <a id="l512"></a>&amp; the Temple, the bloody warrs in the reign of Adrian by which the <a id="l513"></a>Iews were wonderfully slaughtered &amp; banished from <a id="l514"></a>Iudea, &amp; their <a id="l515"></a>Land given entirely to the Gentiles, &amp; the return of the Iews from <a id="l516"></a>their long captivity, &amp; the coming of Christ to  reign &amp; judge the world, <a id="l517"></a>for which end he was annointed, are all of them predicted.</p>
            <p id="par45">The interpretation of the prophesy of the seventy weeks is <a id="l518"></a>already confirmed by the event. That of the seven weeks is here <a id="l519"></a>proposed, not as certainty, but by way of enquiry, &amp; to be exa<a id="l520"></a>mined amended &amp; improved by the event of things, untill the Iews <a id="l521"></a>shall return from their long captivity as Moses &amp; the Prophets <a id="l522"></a>have predicted &amp; untill the coming of the kingdom for which we daily <a id="l523"></a>pray. For Daniels visions are sealed up unto the time of the end. <a id="l524"></a>And then many shall run to &amp; fro, &amp; knowledge shall be encreased. <a id="l525"></a>And the wise (those that feare God &amp; believe his prophesies) shall <a id="l526"></a>understand but none of the wicked shall understand. Learning is <a id="l527"></a>not sufficient to make those understand who are prejudiced through <a id="l528"></a>unbelief.</p>
