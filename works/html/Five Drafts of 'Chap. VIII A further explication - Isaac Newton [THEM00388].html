<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Chap. VIIII. <a id="l1"></a><br>A further <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">explication</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">description</span></span> of the   four Empires </h2>
<p id="par1">The Prophesy of the scripture of truth is a commentary <a id="l3"></a>upon the Vision of the Ram &amp; He-Goat, &amp; Daniel compre<a id="l4"></a>hends the times of the two first Monarchies in the Ram, &amp; <a id="l5"></a>the times of the two last in the Goat. For he tell us that <em class="underline">the <a id="l6"></a>Ram had two horns &amp; the two horns were high but one was <a id="l7"></a>higher then the other &amp; the higher came up last</em>, and that <a id="l8"></a>the <em class="underline">Ram having two horns are the kings of Media &amp; Persia</em> <a id="l9"></a>that is, the horn which came up first is the kingdom of <a id="l10"></a>Media &amp; the horn which came up last is the kingdom of <a id="l11"></a>Persia. The kingdom of Persia is the second Empire &amp; <a id="l12"></a>the kingdom of Media was contemporary to the first. <a id="l13"></a>And as the Ram in the reign of his first horn compre<a id="l14"></a>hends the times of the first horn &amp; in the reign of his <a id="l15"></a>second horn is the second Empire, so the Goat in the <a id="l16"></a>reign of his five first horns is the third Empire &amp; <a id="l17"></a>in the reign of his last horn comprehends the times of <a id="l18"></a>the fourth.</p>
<p id="par2">For Daniel tells us that the Goat <em class="underline">had a notable horn be<a id="l19"></a>tween his eyes &amp; waxed very great &amp; when it was strong the <a id="l20"></a>great horn was broken &amp; for it came up four notable</em>  <a id="l21"></a><em class="underline">ones towards the four winds of heaven</em>. And in explaining <a id="l22"></a>this he saith that <em class="underline">the rough Goat is the king of Greece &amp; <a id="l23"></a>the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king <a id="l24"></a>Now that being broken,  whereas four stood up for it <a id="l25"></a>four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but <a id="l26"></a>not in his power</em>. In all this Prophesy Daniel's kings are <a id="l27"></a>kingdoms. The kings of Media &amp; Persia are the kingdoms <a id="l28"></a>of Media &amp; Persia, &amp; the k4ing of Greece is the kingdom <a id="l29"></a>of Greece, &amp; the first king is the first kingdom. It is <a id="l30"></a>not the person of Alexander the great but his kingdom in <a id="l31"></a>a monarchical form during his own reign &amp; the reign of his <a id="l32"></a>brother Arid<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>æ<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>œ<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>us &amp; son Alexander. For this  king was succeeded <a id="l33"></a>by four kingdoms &amp; kingdoms did not come in the room of <a id="l34"></a>Alexanders person but in the room of his kingdom. Now by <a id="l35"></a>all this it is manifest that the Goat in the reign of these horns <a id="l36"></a>is the Greek Empire or third Monarchy represented by the <a id="l37"></a>Leopard; the four horns of the Goat &amp; the four heads &amp; <a id="l38"></a>four wings of the Leopard signifying one &amp; the same thing</p>
<p id="par3">Daniel tells us further that <em class="underline">out of one of</em> the four <a id="l39"></a>horns <em class="underline">came forth a little horn  which waxed exceeding 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> great</em>, and in explaining this he saith that <em class="underline">in the end of their <a id="l40"></a>kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce <a id="l41"></a>countenance &amp; understanding dark sentences shall stand up &amp; his <a id="l42"></a>power shall be mighty but not by his own power</em>. All which is <a id="l43"></a>as much to say, that in the end of the kingdom of the Leo<a id="l44"></a>pard when his dominion shall be taken away by his successor the fourth <a id="l45"></a>Beast, his life shall be prolonged &amp; he shall still be mighty <a id="l46"></a>but not by his own power; that is, that the Greeks, after <a id="l47"></a>their proper dominion shall be taken away by the Romans, <a id="l48"></a>shall flourish under the  administration of the <a id="l49"></a>Romans &amp; be mighty by their power. And therefore the <a id="l50"></a>Goat in the reign of the last horn was contemporary to the <a id="l51"></a>fourth Empire.</p>
<p id="par4">The Goat &amp; Leopard are one &amp; the same kingdom, <a id="l52"></a>&amp; reign by their own power untill their dominion is taken <a id="l53"></a>away, &amp; survive the loss of their dominion, &amp; therefore after their <a id="l54"></a>dominion is taken away reign by &amp; under the power of <a id="l55"></a>another. In the vision of the four Beasts Daniel describes <a id="l56"></a>only the reign of the Leopard by his own power &amp; tells you <a id="l57"></a>that after his dominion is taken away his life shall be – <a id="l58"></a>prolonged: in the vision of the  Goat he repeats the <a id="l59"></a>reign of the Leopard by his own power which lasts untill <a id="l60"></a>the end of the kingdom of the four horns of the Goat, &amp; <a id="l61"></a>then under the type of the Goat reigning in a new horn he <a id="l62"></a>describes the life &amp; actions of the Leopard after his domi<a id="l63"></a>nion is taken away &amp; tells you that his power shall be <a id="l64"></a>mighty but not by his own power. He represents this horn <a id="l65"></a>great above all the former horns, exceeding great in <a id="l66"></a>breadth eastward &amp; southward &amp; great in height up to <a id="l67"></a>the stars of heaven but not by his own power. And such <a id="l68"></a>a greatness can signify nothing less then the mighty power <a id="l69"></a>of the Greeks by &amp; under the administration of the <a id="l70"></a>Romans; this being the only power in the world that has <a id="l71"></a>hitherto been greater then the power of Alexander the great. <a id="l72"></a>So then the Goat in the reign of the last horn is the Leopard <a id="l73"></a>surviving the loss of his dominion &amp; being still mighty but <a id="l74"></a>not by his own power, &amp; living in this state till the stone <a id="l75"></a>falls upon the feet of the Image &amp; breaks in pieces all the <a id="l76"></a>four parts of the image at once, that is, till the end of the <a id="l77"></a>fourth Empire. For the nations of the Greeks in Europe <a id="l78"></a>Asia Syria &amp; Egypt are still mighty but not by their own <a id="l79"></a>power. They were formerly mighty by the power of the Ro<a id="l80"></a>mans &amp; they are now mighty by the power of the Turks, &amp; Daniel <a id="l81"></a>tells us that the vision of the Goat reigning in his last horn <a id="l82"></a>is at the time of the end &amp; in the last end of the indignation <a id="l83"></a>(Dan. VIII.17, 19) that is, it reaches to the end of all Daniels <a id="l84"></a>visions &amp; to the last end of the Iewish captivity.</p>
<p id="par5">The last horn of the Goat is by some taken for Antiochus 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span>Epiphanes, but very injudiciously. A horn of a Beast is never <a id="l85"></a>taken for single person. A new horn always signifies <a id="l86"></a>a new kingdom, &amp; the kingdom of Antiochus was an old <a id="l87"></a>one. Antiochus reigned over one of the four horns, &amp; <a id="l88"></a>the little horn was at first a little one &amp; waxed exceeding great <a id="l89"></a>&amp; so did not Antiochus. It is described great above all <a id="l90"></a>the former horns &amp; so was not Antiochus. His kingdom <a id="l91"></a>on the contrary was weake &amp; tributary to the Romans <a id="l92"></a>&amp; he did not enlarge it. The horn was a king of fierce <a id="l93"></a>countenance &amp; destroyed wonderfully &amp; prospered in <a id="l94"></a>his practices against the holy people, but Antiochus <a id="l95"></a>was frighted out of Egypt by a mere message of the <a id="l96"></a>Romans &amp; afterwards routed &amp; baffled by the Iews. <a id="l97"></a>The horn was mighty in anothers power, Antiochus <a id="l98"></a>acted by his own. The horn cast down the sanctuary to the grownd, &amp; so did not Antiochus. The sanctuary &amp; host were trampled under foot 2300 days &amp; in Daniels prophesies, day are put for years. These things were to last till the last end of the Indignation against the Iews &amp; this Indignation is not yet at an end. In the first year of his reign he <a id="l99"></a>granted a licence to the transgressors of the holy covenant <a id="l100"></a>to teach the customes of the heathens in Iudea, in the <a id="l101"></a>sixt year he spoiled the Temple, in the eighth he set up <a id="l102"></a>the heathen worship in the Temple &amp; in all Iudea, &amp; <a id="l103"></a>in the eleventh the Temple was cleansed, &amp; none of <a id="l104"></a>these periods answer to the 2300 days. The Iews kept <a id="l105"></a>no account of time by days longer then a month. They <a id="l106"></a>counted the age of the Moon or days of the Month, &amp; <a id="l107"></a>the Moons or Months in a year, but their years <a id="l108"></a>consisted of no certain number of days: and for <a id="l109"></a>Daniel to tell the Iews of an exact period of 2300 <a id="l110"></a>natural days when they had no method in use of count<a id="l111"></a>ing that number nor could determin by their years <a id="l112"></a>&amp; months the number of days in any time past, would <a id="l113"></a>have been very improper. And therefore days in this <a id="l114"></a>prophesy as well as in all the rest of Daniel's prophesies, <a id="l115"></a>are types of years, &amp; the 2300 years are not yet expired</p>
<p id="par6">Yet the little horn began to grow great in the reign of <a id="l116"></a>Antiochus Epiphanes or soon after. For as the two horns of the <a id="l117"></a>Ram continued standing together upon his head till the Goat <a id="l118"></a>smote him &amp; brake both his horns, &amp; yet the Medes were <a id="l119"></a>conquered by the Persians long before, so we are to conceive <a id="l120"></a>that the four horns of the Goat, notwithstanding any con<a id="l121"></a>quests that they may make upon one another, continue <a id="l122"></a>standing  together upon the head of the Goat untill they <a id="l123"></a>begin to fall by a forreign power, that is, untill the 8<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l124"></a>of Antiochus Epiphanes when the Romans conquered the <a id="l125"></a>kingdom of Macedon which was one of the four. All this was <a id="l126"></a>the time of their reign &amp; the end or last time of their kingdom was 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span>the time of their falling. And Daniel tells us that <em class="underline">in the end <a id="l127"></a>of their kingdome when the transgressors are come to the full <a id="l128"></a>a king of fierce countenance shall stand up</em>. By transgressors <a id="l129"></a>he means such as forsake the holy covenant to worship the <a id="l130"></a>Gods of the heathens. For the transgression he calls the trans<a id="l131"></a>gression of desolation (Dan. VIII.13) which is all one as to call <a id="l132"></a>it the abomination of desolation. These transgressors in <a id="l133"></a>the first year of Antiochus set up a place of Exercise <a id="l134"></a>in Ierusalem for teaching the heathen customes, &amp; in the <a id="l135"></a>eighth year  were come to the full, being grown so <a id="l136"></a>numerous &amp; degenerate as to encourage Antiochus to take <a id="l137"></a>away the daily sacrifice &amp; place the abomination. The <a id="l138"></a>king of fierce countenance therefore stood up by degrees in the times <a id="l139"></a>between the beginning of the eighth year of Antiochus <a id="l140"></a>in which the kingdom of the four horns began to fall &amp; <a id="l141"></a>the conquest of Egypt by Augustus when its fall was com<a id="l142"></a>pleted.</p>
<p id="par7">Now Daniel tells us that the little horn came out <a id="l143"></a>of one of the four horns, that is, it grew out of the side <a id="l144"></a>thereof as a branch, so that the horn &amp; its branch appear<a id="l145"></a>ed together in the form of two horns upon one base the <a id="l146"></a>lesser of which grew out of the greater, &amp; this signifies <a id="l147"></a>the division of one of the four kingdoms into two,  <a id="l148"></a>the lesser of which arises &amp; increases out of the  <a id="l149"></a>substance of the greater. Daniel tells us also that this <a id="l150"></a>little horn waxed exceeding great toward the south &amp; toward <a id="l151"></a>the east &amp; toward the pleasant land, &amp; therefore it arose <a id="l152"></a>in the northwest quarter of the Empire of the Greeks &amp; <a id="l153"></a>conquered southward &amp; eastward. And in expounding this vision <a id="l154"></a>Daniel tells us that in the  end of the kingdom of the four <a id="l155"></a>horns when the transgressors are come to the full,  a king of fierce countenance shall <a id="l157"></a>stand up &amp; be mighty but not by his own power, that is, the little <a id="l158"></a>horn  shall <a id="l159"></a> stand up over the nations of the Greeks by <a id="l160"></a>conquering southward &amp; eastward &amp; thereby become exceeding great <a id="l161"></a>but not by his own power. And by all this I conclude that the <a id="l162"></a>little horn is the kingdom of Pergamus.</p>
<p id="par8">For that kingdom arose in the western border of Asia <a id="l163"></a>minor which was the western side of the northern horn. It was <a id="l164"></a>at first exceeding little being only a castle with a small dis<a id="l165"></a>trict. By degrees it increased in power &amp; at length took from <a id="l166"></a>the northern horn almost all Asia on this side the mountain <a id="l167"></a>Taurus, &amp; beating also the Gauls to whom it had been tribu<a id="l168"></a>tary, the governor of Pergamus was saluted king by his <a id="l169"></a>army. Thus it grew on the side &amp; out of the substance of <a id="l170"></a>the northern horn in form of a little horn. Afterwards it lost <a id="l171"></a>part of its territories to Antiochus the great, but recovered all <a id="l172"></a>again by the assistance of the Romans. And continuing in strickt 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span>league with the Romans it assisted them in conquering the <a id="l173"></a>Kingdom of Macedon Sept. 5<sup>th</sup> in the eighth year of Antiochus, An. Philip. <a id="l174"></a>156, Ann. Seleuc. 145, An. Sam. 933, An. Abr. 1883. However it continued still <a id="l175"></a>a little horn, but soon after (An. Sam. 969) by the last <a id="l176"></a>will &amp; testament of its last king Attalus, it became a king <a id="l177"></a>of fierce countenance mighty in power but not by its own power. <a id="l178"></a>It was not conquered,  broken to pieces &amp; destroyed but inherited by the Romans <a id="l179"></a>&amp; continued in their hands as a legacy or gift. They succeeded Attalus <a id="l180"></a>in the throne of this kingdom by a legal right &amp; reigned over <a id="l181"></a>it in the room of its kings as their heirs &amp; successors, &amp; by <a id="l182"></a>their administration management &amp; assistance it became a <a id="l183"></a>king or kingdom of fierce countenance. Then it conquered <a id="l184"></a>the kingdom of Syria An. Sam. 1037 &amp; the kingdom of Iudea <a id="l185"></a>An. Sam. 1038, &amp; the kingdom of Egypt An. Sam. 1071, &amp; <a id="l186"></a>by conquering those three kingdoms it stood up &amp; <em class="underline"> waxed <a id="l187"></a>exceeding great towards the south &amp; towards the east &amp; <a id="l188"></a>towards the pleasant land</em>, but not by its own power. And by <a id="l189"></a>conquering the Iews <em class="underline">it  waxed great even to the host of heaven</em> or Church of God &amp; by <a id="l190"></a>its dominion over them &amp; the Christians <em class="underline">it cast down some <a id="l191"></a>of the host</em> or Church <em class="underline">&amp; of the stars to the grownd. Then it magnifi<a id="l192"></a>ed it self to the Prince of the host, &amp; took away his daily <a id="l193"></a>worship &amp; cast down the place of his sanctuary,</em> that is of the <a id="l194"></a>sanctuary of his  host or people the Christians. For the <a id="l195"></a>Prince of the host is Iesus Christ here called Michael the great Prince which standeth for the  people of Daniel. <em class="underline">And an host</em> or Church <em class="underline">was given it by <a id="l196"></a>means of transgression against the daily  worship</em> of the host of <a id="l197"></a>heaven <em class="underline">&amp; it cast down the truth to the ground, &amp; it practised <a id="l198"></a>&amp; prospered</em> even to the <em class="underline">last end of the indignation</em> against <a id="l199"></a>the holy covenant: <em class="underline">for at the time of the end shall be the <a id="l200"></a>vision</em>. But what is meant by the little horn, the trans<a id="l201"></a>gression of desolation &amp; the time of the end will <a id="l202"></a>appear more fully by comparing this vision with the <a id="l203"></a>prophesy of the scripture of truth. For that prophesy <a id="l204"></a>is a commentary upon this vision, both of them conteining the <a id="l205"></a>affairs of the Persians &amp; Greeks from the beginning to the end as will <a id="l206"></a>appear by comparing the prophesies. When Daniel saw the vision of the Ram &amp; Goat the Angel Gabriel interpreted it to him, &amp; now the same Angel appears again to Daniel which a larger interpretation</p>
<p id="par9">In the prophesy of the scripture of truth Daniel <a id="l207"></a>tells us how the first kingdom of the Greeks represented <a id="l208"></a>by the first horn of the Goat broke into four great <a id="l209"></a>kingdoms seated to the four winds of heaven, &amp; then <a id="l210"></a>describes the history of the kings or kingdoms of the <a id="l211"></a>north &amp; south which are two of the four, &amp; prosecutes <a id="l212"></a>the description down to the eighth year of Antiochus <a id="l213"></a>Ephiphanes, the year in which the kingdom of Macedon <a id="l214"></a>was conquered by the Romans, &amp; there he breaks off <a id="l215"></a>&amp; passes from describing the kingdom of the four <a id="l216"></a>horns to describe that of the little horn of the Goat <a id="l217"></a>or king of fierce countenance in these words, <em class="underline">And <a id="l218"></a>arms out of him shall stand up. Arms</em> are every <a id="l219"></a>where in this prophesy put for the military force of a 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span>kingdom; <em class="underline">out of him</em> is out of the people of his kingdom <a id="l220"></a>&amp; <em class="underline">standing up</em> signifies making war &amp; growing great &amp; <a id="l221"></a>powerfull by conquest, &amp; here it signifies standing up  <a id="l222"></a>over the kingdoms of the north &amp; south of which Daniel <a id="l223"></a>has been hitherto speaking. Arms shall stand up &amp; a <a id="l224"></a>king of fierce countenance shall stand up are expressions <a id="l225"></a>of the same signification. These arms are the king of <a id="l226"></a>fierce countenance &amp; both are the little horn of the <a id="l227"></a>Goat. <em class="underline">Arms out of him shall stand up,</em> that is, the little <a id="l228"></a>horn growing out of the substance or people of the northern <a id="l229"></a>horn or kingdom of the north, shall wax exceeding great <a id="l230"></a>towards the south &amp; towards the east &amp; toward the <a id="l231"></a>pleasant land by conquest. These arms grew out of <a id="l232"></a>the people of the king of the north by conquest till <a id="l233"></a>they became a little horn, &amp; this horn was still to <a id="l234"></a>grow out of the remainder of the people of that <a id="l235"></a>king  till it became great, &amp; by carrying on its conquests towards the south &amp; towards the east &amp; towards the pleasant land, that is, over Egpyt <a id="l237"></a>Syria &amp; Phenicia, to wax exceeding great, but not in its own power.</p>
<p id="par10">You may translate קמנן not <em class="underline">out of him</em> but <a id="l238"></a><em class="underline">after him</em>, as ממלח signifies <em class="underline">after the king</em> Dan. <a id="l239"></a>11.8. And then the words will run thus, <em class="underline">And after <a id="l240"></a>him arms shall stand up</em>, &amp; may be understood of <a id="l241"></a>the kingdom of Macedon standing up first in the power <a id="l242"></a>of the conquering Romans &amp; then by the access of <a id="l243"></a>the kingdom of Pergamus &amp; successive conquests of <a id="l244"></a>the kingdoms of Syria Phœnicia &amp; Egypt. In the prophe<a id="l245"></a>sy of the he-goat this kingdom is derived from the kingdom <a id="l246"></a>of Pergamus represented by the little horn of that beast. In this <a id="l247"></a>of the scripture of truth it is derived from the kingdom of Macedon <a id="l248"></a> the fundamental kingdom of the Greek Empire,  &amp; the first kingdom <a id="l250"></a>of the Greeks whose power became mighty but not by his own power. <a id="l251"></a>For it arose from the kingdoms of Pergamus &amp; Macedon growing into <a id="l252"></a>one by the legacy of Attalus, &amp; it was fit that both its originals <a id="l253"></a>should be represented in these prophesies.</p>

<p id="par12">The Angel Gabriel in interpreting the vision of the ram <a id="l259"></a>&amp; he-goat, tells Daniel that <em class="underline">the rough Goat is the king of Greece <a id="l260"></a>&amp; the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. And that <a id="l261"></a>being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall <a id="l262"></a>stand up out of the nation but not in his power. And in the latter <a id="l263"></a>time of their kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full <a id="l264"></a>a king of fierce countenance &amp; understanding dark sentences <a id="l265"></a>shall stand up &amp; his power shall be mighty but not by his own <a id="l266"></a>power</em>. By kings he understands kingdoms. And because the period <a id="l267"></a>of time when the transgressors are come to the full relates to the <a id="l268"></a>vision concerning the daily worship &amp; the transgression of desolation <a id="l269"></a>which was to last 2300 prophetick days, the same Angel 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span>Gabriel in the prophesy of the scripture of truth, after he had <a id="l270"></a>described the rise of the kingdom of Greece represented by <a id="l271"></a>the rise of the first horn of the Goat, &amp; its breaking into <a id="l272"></a>four kingdoms represented by the four next horns, to point out <a id="l273"></a>the period of time called the latter time of their kingdom when <a id="l274"></a>the transgressors are come to the full &amp; the king of fierce counte<a id="l275"></a>nance begins to stand up, he describes the particular actions of <a id="l276"></a>the single kings of two of the four  kingdoms which he <a id="l277"></a>calls the kings of the north &amp; south &amp; prosecutes the descrip<a id="l278"></a>tion to the last return of Antiochus out of Egypt, which was <a id="l279"></a>in the eighth year of his reign the year in which the kingdom of the Greeks began to fall, the Romans <a id="l280"></a>then conquering Macedon. And at that period of time he passes from <a id="l281"></a>describing the actions of the kings of the north &amp; south to de<a id="l282"></a>scribe the affairs of the Arms which then begin to stand up. <a id="l283"></a>And therefore the eighth year of Antiochus is the period <a id="l284"></a>of time called the latter time of the kingdom of the four <a id="l285"></a>horns when the transgressors are come to the full &amp; the king <a id="l286"></a>of fierce countenance begins to stand up; &amp; the arms which <a id="l287"></a>then begin to stand up are this king of fierce countenance, <a id="l288"></a>or last horn of the goat; &amp; the remaining part of the <a id="l289"></a>prophesy of the scripture of truth relates to that horn. <a id="l290"></a>And this I take to be the true reason why the Angel <a id="l291"></a>after he comes to this period insists no longer upon <a id="l292"></a>the particular actions of the single kings of the north <a id="l293"></a>&amp; south but passes on through all the times following <a id="l294"></a>by touching only upon the main turns of affairs relating <a id="l295"></a>to the reign of the last horn. </p>
<p id="par13">And it is to be observed that the Angel in passing on <a id="l297"></a>from this period downwards to the end of the prophesy proceeds <a id="l298"></a>by two large intervalls of time answering to the double <a id="l299"></a>reign of the last horn, that reign which followed its waxing <a id="l300"></a>great to the host of heaven, &amp; that which followed its <a id="l301"></a>waxing up to the Prince of the host. The first intervall <a id="l302"></a>conteins the reign of this horn by anothers power,  or <a id="l303"></a>the reign of the Greeks under the dominion of the Latines. <a id="l304"></a>the second conteins the reign &amp; fate of the Greek Empire <a id="l305"></a>after separation from the Latines. The first comprehends <a id="l306"></a>the taking away of the Iewish daily worship &amp; placing <a id="l307"></a>of the abomination of desolation in their land: the second <a id="l308"></a>comprehends the taking away of the Christian daily worship <a id="l309"></a>&amp; placing the transgression of desolation in the sanctuary of <a id="l310"></a>the Christians. The first is ushered in which these words; <a id="l311"></a><em class="underline">but it shall not prosper, for yet the end  <a id="l312"></a>shall be at the time appointed</em>, that is, the conspira<a id="l313"></a>cy of Antiochus Epiphanes with the king of Egypt against <a id="l314"></a>the holy covenant for taking away the daily worship <a id="l315"></a>of the Iews &amp; setting up the heathen Gods in all the land <a id="l316"></a>of Iudea, shall not prosper because the time of the end <a id="l317"></a>in which the transgression of desolation is to prosper  <a id="l318"></a> is not yet come. The second is ushered in with these <a id="l319"></a>words, <em class="underline">And of those of understanding there shall fall <a id="l320"></a>to try them &amp; to purge &amp; make white to the time of <a id="l321"></a>the end because it is yet for a time appointed</em>, or because <a id="l322"></a>there is yet a certain time in which they shall fall untill the <a id="l323"></a>time of the end commences. <em class="underline">For a king shall do according to 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span>his will – &amp; shall prosper till the indignation</em> [against the <a id="l324"></a>holy covenant] <em class="underline">be accomplished</em> [&amp; the sanctuary be cleansed.] <a id="l325"></a>In setting up the abomination of the Mahuzzims &amp; casting <a id="l326"></a>down those of understanding &amp; making a desolation of the saints <a id="l327"></a>this king of Greece shall do according to his will till the time <a id="l328"></a>of the end, &amp; shall prosper not only in setting up the transgression <a id="l329"></a>of desolation before the time of the end, but also in continuing it <a id="l330"></a>during all the time of the end untill the indignation  against <a id="l331"></a>the holy covenant be accomplished &amp; the sanctuary be clean<a id="l332"></a>sed. For the last end of the indignation is the time of the <a id="l333"></a>end. The abomination lasts till the sanctuary be <a id="l334"></a>cleansed, &amp; the desolation accompanies the abomination <a id="l335"></a>&amp; is caused by the kings indignation, &amp; the time when all these rage &amp; <a id="l336"></a>continue at the height is called the time of the end. For as <a id="l337"></a>Antiochus Epiphanes, when he last returned out of Egpyt <a id="l338"></a>&amp; interdicted the daily sacrifice of the Iews &amp; set up the <a id="l339"></a> worship of the heathen Gods in all Iudea, is said to <a id="l340"></a>have indignation against the holy covenant (Dan. 11.30) so <a id="l341"></a>by the indignation in the reign of the king who doth accord<a id="l342"></a>ing to his will is to be understood the kings indignation <a id="l343"></a>against the holy covenant in favour of the abomination <a id="l344"></a>of the Mahuzzims, whereby the people of God are  <a id="l345"></a>persecuted troden under foot &amp; made desolate untill the <a id="l346"></a>sanctuary be cleansed, &amp; by consequence all the time <a id="l347"></a>of the end. But let us go over the prophesy in order of <a id="l348"></a>time.</p>
<p id="par14">After the kingdom of Pergamus was united to that <a id="l349"></a>of Macedon, &amp; by the power of the Romans &amp; under <a id="l350"></a>their administration had extended its dominion over Syria <a id="l351"></a>Iudea &amp; Egypt (all which is comprehended in the words <a id="l352"></a><em class="underline">And after him arms shall stand up</em>) they made a new <a id="l353"></a>war upon the Iews in the reign of Nero Vespasian <a id="l354"></a>Trajan &amp; Hadrian, burnt their Temple, destroyed their <a id="l355"></a>city, set up the heathen Gods in all Iudea, &amp; dispersed <a id="l356"></a>the people into all nations, forbidding them to enter <a id="l357"></a>Iudea upon pain of death. And this is thus described by Da<a id="l358"></a>niel: <em class="underline">And they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength &amp; take <a id="l359"></a>away the daily</em> [worship] <em class="underline">&amp; place the abomination which maketh <a id="l360"></a>desolate.</em> For thus Christ himself understood this prophesy, <a id="l361"></a>telling his disciples: <em class="underline">When ye therefore shall see the abomi<a id="l362"></a>nation of desolation stand  in the holy <a id="l363"></a>place (whoso readeth let him understand) then let them who <a id="l364"></a>be in Iudea fly unto the mountains</em> Mat XXIV.15. And this  setting up the abominatiō of desolation in the holy Land is also <a id="l365"></a>described plainly by Daniel in his prophesy of the weeks. <em class="underline">The <a id="l366"></a>Messiah,</em> saith he, <em class="underline">shall be a cut off – &amp; the people of a prince <a id="l367"></a>that shall come shall destroy the city &amp; the sanctuary, &amp; the <a id="l368"></a>end thereof shall be with a flood, &amp; unto the end of the war <a id="l369"></a>desolations are determined – &amp; upon a wing of abominations</em> <a id="l370"></a>[or by the overspreading of abominations as a bird overspreads <a id="l371"></a>her wing] <em class="underline">he shall make</em> [the land] <em class="underline">desolate</em>. <sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> And thus was <a id="l374"></a>the desolation completed of which the prophet Hosea speaks <a id="l375"></a>in these words <sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> <em class="underline">The children of Israel shall abide many days <a id="l376"></a>without a King &amp; without a Prince, &amp; without a sacrifice &amp;

<p id="par15">When the Romans made war upon the Iews they <a id="l380"></a>looked upon all the Iews (the Christian Iews as well as <a id="l381"></a>others) to be their enemies &amp; upon all the Christian <a id="l382"></a>Gentiles to be friends to the Christian Iews, &amp; for that <a id="l383"></a>reason began from that time forward to vex the <a id="l384"></a>Christians. And because the Christians were enemies <a id="l385"></a>to the heathen religion, the heathens continued to vex <a id="l386"></a>&amp; persecute them from time to time till the reign of <a id="l387"></a>Constantine the great &amp; his sons. And then the Empire <a id="l388"></a>becoming Christian, great multitudes of heathens came <a id="l389"></a>over to the profession of the Christian religion. All which <a id="l390"></a>is thus exprest by Daniel. <em class="underline">And such as forsake the <a id="l391"></a>covenant</em> [fals Christs &amp; false Apostles &amp; fals prophets, <a id="l392"></a>the many Antichrists who began in the Apostles days  to <a id="l393"></a>go out of the Church &amp; are called the mystery of iniquity, they] <a id="l394"></a><em class="underline">shall seduce men with flatteries: but the people that do know <a id="l395"></a>their God shall be strong &amp; act.

They that fall are the <a id="l403"></a>stars which the last horn of the Goat cast down to the <a id="l404"></a>ground &amp; stamped upon , &amp; the flatterers or dissemblers <a id="l405"></a>are the heathens who in the reign of Constantine &amp; <a id="l406"></a>his sons flowed into the Christian churches in great num<a id="l407"></a>bers for temporal ends, being not truly converted but <a id="l408"></a>feigning &amp; only making an outward profession of the <a id="l409"></a>Christian religion. And these dissembling hypocrites made <a id="l410"></a>the church numerous &amp; splendid in outward appearance <a id="l411"></a>but being still inclined in their hearts to the heathen <a id="l412"></a>superstitions &amp; continuing to live voluptuous &amp; vitious <a id="l413"></a>lives quickly corrupted the Christian religion filling it <a id="l414"></a>full of heathen superstitions &amp; vitious practises, whereby <a id="l415"></a>the sincere part of Christians who opposed the super<a id="l416"></a>stitions &amp; vices of the multitude could not avoid being <a id="l417"></a>involved in new troubles. For the flatterers pressing <a id="l418"></a>into places of profit honour &amp; trust (which was the <a id="l419"></a>end of their professing Christianity) easily prevailed <a id="l420"></a>by their numbers &amp; power to establish their superstiti<a id="l421"></a><br>ons &amp; oppress all those that opposed them. And <a id="l422"></a>therefore Daniel adds: <em class="underline">But of those of understanding <a id="l423"></a>there shall fall to try them &amp; to purge them</em> [from 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span>flatterers] <em class="underline">&amp; to make white even to the time of the end <a id="l424"></a>because it is yet for a time appointed</em>. These last words, <a id="l425"></a>as I represented above, shew that this is a very notable <a id="l426"></a>period of time &amp; begins a new scene of things, namely <a id="l427"></a>a new reign of the Greeks by the division of the Roman <a id="l428"></a>Empire &amp; a new persecution of the saints under this king. <a id="l429"></a>And this reign &amp; persecution last a least till the time of the <a id="l430"></a>end.</p>
<p id="par16">The flatterers therefore now separate from the people of <a id="l431"></a>God &amp; prevail in the Greek Empire &amp; become the host of the <a id="l432"></a>little horn &amp; begin to persecute the saints. For Daniel adds <a id="l433"></a>in the next words: <em class="underline">And the king</em> [of Greece] <em class="underline">shall do according <a id="l434"></a>to his will &amp;</em> [by assuming a legislative power in matters of <a id="l435"></a>religion &amp; by his host of flatterers] <em class="underline">shall exalt himself &amp; <a id="l436"></a>magnify himself above every God &amp; shall speak marvellous <a id="l437"></a>things against the God of Gods &amp;</em> [in doing so &amp; wearing out the <a id="l438"></a>saints] <em class="underline">shall prosper till the indignation</em>  [against <a id="l439"></a>Gods people &amp; the holy covenant] <em class="underline">be accomplished: for that <a id="l440"></a>which is determined shall be done</em>.</p>
<p id="par17">The Greek Emperors by calling together Councills of <a id="l441"></a>their own bishops imposed upon the Churches what laws <a id="l442"></a>they pleased in matters of religion. For the Council <a id="l443"></a>decreed whatever the Emperor pleased, as is manifest in <a id="l444"></a>history. And therefore saith: <em class="underline">He shall magnify himself <a id="l445"></a>above every God &amp; speak marvellous things against the <a id="l446"></a>God of Gods</em>, that is, he shall speak them as a law-<a id="l447"></a>giver &amp; by dictating laws against the laws of God he <a id="l448"></a>shall exalt &amp; magnify himself above every God &amp; wear <a id="l449"></a>out the saints. For dictating laws in matters of  <a id="l450"></a>revealed religion is usurping divine authority &amp; sitting <a id="l451"></a>in God's throne, or as the Apostle Paul expresseth, it <a id="l452"></a>is exalting himself above all that is called God or <a id="l453"></a>that is worshipped, so that he as a God sitteth in the <a id="l454"></a>Temple of God shewing himself that he is  a God. <a id="l455"></a>It is sitting in Gods throne in the Temple between the <a id="l456"></a>cherubims where God dictated laws to the Iews, &amp; was <a id="l457"></a>worshipped by them. When Daniel tells us that the <a id="l458"></a>little horn of the fourth beast <em class="underline">should speak great <a id="l459"></a>words against the most high &amp; wear out the saints <a id="l460"></a>of the most high</em>, he means that this horn should speak <a id="l461"></a>as a law-giver &amp; by making laws against the laws <a id="l462"></a>of God should wear out the saints. For in the next <a id="l463"></a>words he adds that this horn should <em class="underline">think to change times <a id="l464"></a>&amp; laws &amp; they should be given into his hands for a time <a id="l465"></a>times &amp; half a time</em>. And in the same sense he tells <a id="l466"></a>us that the <em class="underline">little horn of the fourth Beast</em> king who <a id="l467"></a>doth according to his will should <em class="underline">speak marvellous things <a id="l468"></a>against the God of Gods</em>.</p>
<p id="par18">In the reign of Constantine &amp; his son Constantius <a id="l469"></a>the profession of monkery was set on foot in the wilder<a id="l470"></a>nesses of Egypt &amp; Syria by Antony &amp; Hilarion, &amp; in the <a id="l471"></a>reign of Valens &amp; Theodosius, the moncks in those two 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span>provinces being grown very numerous crept into towns <a id="l472"></a>under the protection of the bishops of Alexandria <a id="l473"></a>&amp;  Antioch &amp; soon overspread all the Empire. They <a id="l474"></a>placed their religion in abstinence from marriage &amp; from <a id="l475"></a>meats &amp; in bodily austerities which are hurtfull to them<a id="l476"></a>selves &amp; of no use to mankind. And for these things they <a id="l477"></a>were admired by all the empire as men more holy <a id="l478"></a>than the rest. And therefore Daniel adds: <em class="underline">Neither <a id="l479"></a>shall he regard the God of his fathers nor the <a id="l480"></a>desire of weomen</em>, that is, the lawfull desire of weomen in <a id="l481"></a>matrimony, as the Apostle Paul thus explains: <sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> <em class="underline">In <a id="l482"></a>the latter times some shall depart from the faith, <a id="l483"></a>giving heed to spirits of seduction &amp; doctrines of <a id="l484"></a>Ghosts, speaking lyes in hypocrisy, having consci<a id="l485"></a>ences seared as with a hot iron, forbidding to marry <a id="l486"></a>&amp; commanding to abstein from meats which God <a id="l487"></a>hath created to be received with thanksgiving of <a id="l488"></a>them that know the truth</em>. The Moncks were a <a id="l489"></a>new sort of Christians not instituted by Christ or <a id="l490"></a>his Apostles nor heard of in the primitive <a id="l491"></a>Churches. You may know them by their fruits. <a id="l492"></a>For they were the ring-leaders in bringing into <a id="l493"></a>the Christian Churches all manner of heathen <a id="l494"></a>superstitions &amp; particularly the doctrine of ghosts, <a id="l495"></a>the invocation of the dead, the worshipping of <a id="l496"></a>dead mens reliques  &amp; pictures &amp; images <a id="l497"></a>&amp; the feigning of miracles &amp; legendary stories <a id="l498"></a>for promoting their superstitions. And from that <a id="l499"></a>time the religion of the Moncks became the reli<a id="l500"></a>gion of the Empire. There remain to this day <a id="l501"></a>among the heathens of Persia &amp; India certain <a id="l502"></a>sects of religious men who place their religion <a id="l503"></a>in abstinence from marriage &amp; meats &amp; in bodily <a id="l504"></a>austerities, &amp; by comparing them with the Moncks <a id="l505"></a>you will find that they are all of a piece.</p>
<p id="par19">About four or five years before the reign <a id="l506"></a>of Valens there began to be a rumour of great <a id="l507"></a>miracles done at the shrines of the martyrs in <a id="l508"></a>Syria. And in his reign &amp; the reign of Theodosius &amp; <a id="l509"></a>Arcadius, the reliques of the martyrs were dispersed <a id="l510"></a>from Egypt &amp; Syria by the Moncks into all the <a id="l511"></a>Empire &amp; lodged in Churches for their miraculous effects <a id="l512"></a>&amp; an opinion was spread that  the dead Saints heard <a id="l513"></a>our prayers, &amp; men began to invoke them &amp; to set up <a id="l514"></a>their pictures in cæmeteries &amp; Churches,  the Moncks being the ringleaders in <a id="l516"></a>all these practises. And therefore Daniel subjoyns: <em class="underline">But <a id="l517"></a>in his seat he shall honour with [his] God Mahuzzims</em> [or potent

As God is in scripture frequently called <a id="l528"></a>the rock &amp; fortres &amp; tower of his people, &amp; his Temple <a id="l529"></a>the sanctuary of strength: so fals Gods are called the <a id="l530"></a>rocks of the nations &amp; by Daniel Mahuzzims &amp; their <a id="l531"></a>temples strong holds. And as the lands given to the Bishop of Rome are said to be given to S<sup>t</sup> Peter &amp; are called Peters Patrimony; so the lands given to Abbies Monasteries &amp; other religious societies are the Patrimony of the saints to whom the Societies with their lands are dedicated.</p>
<p id="par20">Now this king by magnifying himself above every <a id="l532"></a>God &amp; speaking mervellous things  in <a id="l533"></a>his laws against the God of Gods &amp; together with a strange <a id="l534"></a>God whom his fathers knew not honouring Mahuzzims in the <a id="l535"></a>Temples with  gold &amp; silver &amp; with gemms &amp; things of <a id="l536"></a>value, that is with altars &amp; pictures &amp; other presents adorned <a id="l537"></a>with gold &amp; silver &amp; gemms took away the dayly worship &amp; <a id="l538"></a>set up the abomination of desolation in the Christian cities <a id="l539"></a>&amp; towns as the old Romans had done before in the Iewish. All <a id="l540"></a>which Daniel has thus described in his vision of the last horn <a id="l541"></a>of the He-Goat. <em class="underline">Yea he magnified himself even to the <a id="l542"></a>Prince of the host</em> [that is, to Iesus Christ] <em class="underline">&amp; by him the dayly worship</em> <a id="l543"></a>[of the people of the Prince the Christians] <em class="underline">was taken away <a id="l544"></a>&amp; the place of his sanctuary</em>  [or places of <a id="l545"></a>meeting to worship him] <em class="underline">was cast down.

This practicing &amp; prospering relates to the time <a id="l551"></a>of the end: for the vision is said to be at the time of the end <a id="l552"></a>&amp; in the last end of the indignation. The setting up the <a id="l553"></a>transgression  was attempted by Antiochus Epiphanes but <a id="l554"></a>was not then to prosper  because the time of the end <a id="l555"></a>was not come. It was not to prosper till the time of the <a id="l556"></a>end. And therefore since the king who doth according to his <a id="l557"></a>will prospers till the indignation be accomplished, he <a id="l558"></a>reigns  till the time of end <a id="l559"></a>&amp; in it, &amp; the worship of the Mahuzzims continues <a id="l560"></a>till the sanctuary be cleansed. For the time of the end <a id="l561"></a>is now commencing.</p>
<p id="par21">For after the invocation of Saints &amp; the venera<a id="l562"></a>tion of their pictures &amp; reliques were established: the <a id="l563"></a>empire of the Saracens rose up in the south &amp; made <a id="l564"></a>lasting wars  upon the Greek Empire, taking <a id="l565"></a>some countries from the Greeks &amp; besieging Constantino<a id="l566"></a>ple several times.

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013r"> &lt;13r&gt; </span>the Empire of the Turks rose up in the north &amp; con<a id="l567"></a>quered the Greek empire &amp; extended its conquests gra<a id="l568"></a>dually over Syria Phœnicia Arabia Egypt Libya &amp; <a id="l569"></a>Ethiopia, reigning over all these countries to this day. <a id="l570"></a>All which is thus described by Daniel. <em class="underline">And at the <a id="l571"></a>time of the end the king of the south shall push at him <a id="l572"></a>&amp; the king of the north shall come against him like <a id="l573"></a>a whirle-winde with chariots &amp; with horsmen &amp; with <a id="l574"></a>many ships, &amp; he shall enter into the countries</em> <a id="l575"></a>[of the Greeks] <em class="underline">&amp; shall overflow</em> [them] <em class="underline">&amp; pass over</em> <a id="l576"></a>[by conquering their Empire.] <em class="underline">He shall enter also <a id="l577"></a>into the glorious land</em> [of Iudea] <em class="underline">&amp; many countries</em> <a id="l578"></a>[in those parts] <em class="underline">shall be overflown.

<p id="par23">Thus Daniel in this prophesy of the scripture of truth hath <a id="l617"></a>described by steps the chief actions &amp; revolutions within the <a id="l618"></a>compass of the Greek empire in all ages from the reign of <a id="l619"></a>Alexander the great to the resurrection of the dead.  And <a id="l620"></a>in doing this he hath distinguished the times into three or four <a id="l621"></a>cardinall periods. The first is of the reign of the Greeks untill <a id="l622"></a>the Romans began to conquer them. The second is of the Romans <a id="l623"></a>over the Greeks untill the division of their Empire into the <a id="l624"></a>Empires of the Greeks &amp; Latines. The third is of the Greek Em<a id="l625"></a>pire at Constantinople after separation from the Latines untill <a id="l626"></a>the rise &amp; reign of the Mahometans. And the fourth is of <a id="l627"></a>the Mahometans reigning successively in the south &amp; north <a id="l628"></a>&amp; making war upon the Greeks. And these periods are distin<a id="l629"></a>guished from one another by saying in the beginning of the <a id="l630"></a>second &amp; again in the beginning of the third that the end is <a id="l631"></a>yet for a time appointed &amp; calling the fourth the time of <a id="l632"></a>the end. The first lasted till the transgressors came to the full. The second began with the practises against the <a id="l633"></a>daily worship of the Iews, the third with the rise &amp; reign <a id="l634"></a>of the religion of the Moncks, &amp; the fourth with the rise <a id="l635"></a>&amp; reign of the religion of the Mahometans. In the second <a id="l636"></a>the abomination of the heathens was set up in all Iudea, &amp; was en<a id="l637"></a>deavoured by many persecutions to be set up  among the <a id="l638"></a>Christians; in the third the abomination of the Moncks of <a id="l639"></a>invoking the dead, which is a breach of the first commandment, <a id="l640"></a>was set up among the Christians in all the empire in the <a id="l641"></a>fourth the Monckish abomination of worshipping pictures or images which <a id="l642"></a>is a breach of the second commandment, was also set up <a id="l643"></a>in all the Empire; &amp; these abominations made a desolation <a id="l644"></a>of Gods people wherever they were set up, which desolation <a id="l645"></a>continued all the time of the end untill the cleansing of the <a id="l646"></a>sanctuary.</p>
<p id="par24">And its observable that   the first acts against the holy <a id="l647"></a>covenant (after the transgressors were come to the full) was in autumn in the Iudaic year of Seleucus <a id="l648"></a>143 when Antiochus Epiphanes returned out of Egypt &amp; <a id="l649"></a>spoiled the Temple (1 Maccab. 1.20,) &amp; that the last act of <a id="l650"></a>setting up the abomination was in the beginning of the year <a id="l651"></a>of Christ 842 &amp; end of the Iudaic year of Seleucus <a id="l652"></a>1153 when a Council called at Constantinople by the <a id="l653"></a>Empress Theodora &amp; her son Michael, decreed that Pictures Ima<a id="l654"></a>ges which had been condemned &amp; thrown down by some <a id="l655"></a>former Emperors, should be set up again &amp; venerated <a id="l656"></a>as before, &amp; a festival was  instituted to be kept <a id="l657"></a>annually on Feb. 11 in memory of their restitution: &amp; <a id="l658"></a>that the difference between these two periods being 1010 <a id="l659"></a> Iudaic years, is the same with the difference <a id="l660"></a>between the 2300 &amp; the 1290 days, putting a prophetick <a id="l661"></a>day for a Iudaic year.</p>
<p id="par25">And it's further observable that Daniel describes <a id="l662"></a>the last end of all these things by three steps or successive <a id="l663"></a>events. The first event is the fall of the last horn of <a id="l664"></a>the fourth Beast in the end of <em class="underline">a time times &amp; a half a time</em>. <a id="l665"></a>The second event is the fall of the last horn of the Goat <a id="l666"></a>in the end of the indignation when <em class="underline">God shall have accomplished <a id="l667"></a>to scatter the power of the holy people</em> &amp; the sanctuary 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015r"> &lt;15r&gt; </span>shall be cleansed For this horn lasts till the indignation be <a id="l668"></a>accomplished, Dan. 8.19. &amp; 11.36. And the third event is at the <a id="l669"></a>resurrection of Daniel &amp; by consequence at the day of judgment. <a id="l670"></a>But of that day &amp; hour knoweth no man. Now these three <a id="l671"></a>events he describes in this manner. 1 <em class="underline">And one said to the man <a id="l672"></a>cloathed in linnen who was upon the waters of the river, How <a id="l673"></a>long shall it be to the end of these wonders?  <a id="l676"></a>And I heard the man cloathed in linnen who was upon the <a id="l677"></a>waters of the river when he lift up his right hand &amp; his <a id="l678"></a>left unto heaven &amp; sware by him that liveth for ever <a id="l679"></a>that it shall be for a time times &amp; an half</em>.</p>
<p id="par26">2 <em class="underline">And</em> [after that] <em class="underline">when he shall have</em> [] <em class="underline">accom<a id="l680"></a>plished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things <a id="l681"></a>shall be finished. And I heard but I understood not. Then <a id="l682"></a>said I, O my Lord what shall be the end of these things</em> <a id="l683"></a>[when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the <a id="l684"></a>holy people &amp; all these things shall be finished?] <em class="underline">And <a id="l685"></a>he said – from the time that the daily sacrifice shall <a id="l686"></a>be taken away &amp; the abomination that maketh desolate <a id="l687"></a>set up</em> [unto that accomplishment] <em class="underline">there shall be  untill he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people a thou<a id="l688"></a>sand two hundred &amp; ninety days</em>.</p>
<p id="par27">3 <em class="underline">Blessed is he that waiteth &amp; ] cometh to the thousand <a id="l689"></a>three hundred &amp; five &amp; thirty days. For then all these things shall be finished But go thy way till the <a id="l690"></a>end be: for thou shalt rest &amp; stand in thy lot at the end <a id="l691"></a>of the days</em>.</p>
<p id="par28">The he-goat in the reign of his last horn is called by the Apostles <a id="l692"></a>the man of sin from the transgression of desolation set up by him &amp; the <a id="l693"></a>Antichrist from his standing up against the Prince of Princes. And <a id="l694"></a>because he magnifies &amp; exalts himself above every God &amp; speaks <a id="l695"></a>marvellous things against the God of Gods &amp; reigns (but notalways in his own power) till the last <a id="l696"></a>end of the indignation &amp; till the sanctuary be cleansed therefore the man of sin is said to oppose <a id="l697"></a>&amp; exalt himself above every  thing that is called God or <a id="l698"></a>that is worshipped &amp; to sit in the temple of God &amp; continue till <a id="l699"></a>Christ destroys him with sword of his mouth &amp; the brightness of his coming. He is <a id="l700"></a>also represented by the Dragon in the Apocalypse &amp; from his <a id="l701"></a>idolatry called the devil &amp; Satan &amp; his host or Church is <a id="l702"></a>thence called the synagogue of Satan; &amp; because the little horn of the <a id="l703"></a>Goat was the kingdom of Pergamus, this Satan is there said  to <a id="l704"></a>have his seat or throne in Pergamus.</p>
<p id="par29">Daniel tells us that <em class="underline">the words</em> [of the prophesy of the scrip<a id="l705"></a>ture of truth] <em class="underline">are shut up &amp; the book</em> [of this prophesy] <em class="underline">is sealed till the time <a id="l706"></a>of the end</em>.

<h2 id="hd3" class="cent">The first Part <a id="l724"></a> Of the four   Kingdoms represented <a id="l725"></a>by the four Beasts.</h2>
<p id="par31">That  Beasts in Daniel are put for Kingdoms is there <a id="l726"></a>so plainly interpreted that it cannot be disputed. And <a id="l727"></a>so that the  the same  four kingdoms <a id="l728"></a>are signified by the four Beasts &amp; by the four parts <a id="l729"></a>of Nebuchadnezzars image &amp; by consequence the Baby<a id="l730"></a><br>lonian Monarchy by the first Beast (as Daniel interprets , chap 2.38) the Persian by the <a id="l731"></a>second,  the Greecian by the third &amp; the Roman by the fourth is generally agreed <a id="l732"></a>upon   For the dispute which Porphyry &amp; Grotius have made  about the fourth, I think not worth mentioning.</p>

<p id="par33">And whilst the whole Beast signifies the whole <a id="l746"></a>kingdom, his parts must signify the  analogous <a id="l747"></a>parts of the kingdom &amp; particularly  his head   the governing <a id="l753"></a>part  For Kings, Princes, Rulers,  &amp; Leaders 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017v"> &lt;17v&gt; </span> are in scripture frequently called the heads of <a id="l754"></a><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> the people, &amp; where Isaiah saith of Iudah, <em class="underline">From the sole of <a id="l755"></a>the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it</em>, the <a id="l756"></a>Chalde Paraphrast interprets, From the lower People to the <a id="l757"></a>Princes. So Moses saith to Israel: <em class="underline">Thou shalt lend unto many <a id="l758"></a>nations &amp; thou shalt not borrow.<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> And the Lord shall make <a id="l759"></a>thee the head &amp; not the tail, &amp; thou shalt be above only &amp; <a id="l760"></a>thou shalt not be beneath, if thou will hearken unto the <a id="l761"></a>commandments of the Lord – otherwise the stranger that is <a id="l762"></a>within thee shall get up above thee very high &amp; thou shalt <a id="l763"></a>come down very low; he shall lend to the &amp; thou shalt <a id="l764"></a>not lend to him; he shall be the head &amp; thou shall be the taile</em> <a id="l765"></a><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>  So also Isaiah saith of Israel, <em class="underline">The Lord will cut off <a id="l766"></a>from Israel head &amp; tail, branch &amp; rush in one day. The <a id="l767"></a>ancient &amp; honourable he is the head &amp; the Prophet that <a id="l768"></a>teacheth lies he is the tail</em>. And  so Captains are said to <a id="l769"></a>be in the head of the people &amp; the rear of an Army is <a id="l770"></a>called the tail Deut 20.9 Iosh. 10.19. So then the head of <a id="l771"></a>a Beast comprehends all those who are upermost in the <a id="l772"></a>Kingdom &amp; govern the rest &amp; therefore when a Beast hath <a id="l773"></a>more heads then one, they  signify a distinction of <a id="l774"></a>the kingdom into   so many  Governments particular Kingdoms <a id="l776"></a>So the three heads of the Eagle in 2 Esdr. 12.22, 23, are <a id="l777"></a>there interpreted to signify three Kingdoms &amp; so the four <a id="l778"></a>heads of Daniels Leopard are the four Kingdoms into which <a id="l779"></a><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> Daniel himself in two several Prophesies distinguishes the <a id="l780"></a>Greek Monarchy  <a id="l781"></a>e</p>
<p id="par34">The same distinction is signified also by the four wings <a id="l782"></a>of this Leopard. For   feathers <a id="l783"></a> are by the Prophets  put <a id="l784"></a>for  people Ezek  17.3, 7, &amp; 2 Esdr. 11. &amp; thence the stretching <a id="l785"></a>forth of wings signifies the sending forth  armies into forreign <a id="l786"></a>regions to conquer. <em class="underline">The stretching out of the wings of the King <a id="l787"></a>of Assyria shall fill  the breadth of thy land o Immanuel</em> <a id="l788"></a>Isa. 8.8. <em class="underline">He shall fly as an eagle &amp; spread his wings over Moab</em>. <a id="l789"></a>Ier 48.40 &amp; 49.22. <em class="underline">Vpon a wing of abominations he shall make <a id="l790"></a>it desolate</em> Dan 8, that is  he shall overspread it which an <a id="l791"></a>army of Idolaters. For so the author of the Opus imperfectum in 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span> Matthæum  in the beginning of his 49<sup>th</sup> Homily tells us out of Clemeus that Peter <sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> <a id="l792"></a>himself expounded it. <em class="underline">Hoc et Petrus  apud Clementem <a id="l793"></a>exponit.</em> And accordingly for the abomination of desolation <a id="l794"></a>in Matthew we find armies encomapassing Ierusalem in <a id="l795"></a>Luke. And hence to signify that the four kingdoms <a id="l796"></a>represented by the four heads of Daniels Leopard were <a id="l797"></a>founded by the  Macedonians over  conquered <a id="l798"></a>nations (Greece Asia Syria &amp; Egypt) the Leopard is  <a id="l799"></a>said to have also four wings, that is four armies by which <a id="l800"></a>the heads reign over the conquered countries <span class="ns"></span></p>
<p id="par35">Horns  &amp; hoofs being the fighting members   <a id="l801"></a>  of Beasts refer  to the armies of Kingdoms. For which  these do kingdoms fight &amp; push one another. But horns being the highest members respect chiefly Princes &amp;   officers, hoofs &amp; claws the inferior soldiers. So Ezekiel comparing Israel to a flock <a id="l802"></a>of Rams &amp; the heathen kingdoms to Goats &amp; describing <a id="l803"></a>the dispersion of the one by the other, saith, <em class="underline">Ye have <a id="l804"></a>pusht all the diseased which your horns till ye have scattered <a id="l805"></a>them</em> Ezek. 34.21 <em class="underline">And Zedekiah made him horns of iron <a id="l806"></a>&amp; said</em> [the  the King of Israel] – <em class="underline">which these thou shalt push <a id="l807"></a>the Assyrians untill thou have consumed them</em> 1 King <a id="l808"></a>22.11. <em class="underline">Arise thresh o daughter of Zion. I will make <a id="l809"></a>thy hoofs brass &amp; thy horns iron &amp; thou shalt beat <a id="l810"></a>in pieces many  people</em> Micah 4.13. Hence God <a id="l811"></a>is called the horn of Daniel &amp; Christ the horn <a id="l812"></a>Israel to save them from their enemies Psal 18.2 <a id="l813"></a>Luke 1.69, 71, but properly a horn is considered as <a id="l814"></a>the member of a beast or kingdom &amp; refers to martial <a id="l815"></a>men. So the horn of a king 1 Sam 2.10 Psalm 89.<a id="l816"></a>24, &amp; of a kingdom Ier 48.25 Lam. 2.3, 17 is their <a id="l817"></a>military force as the contexts shew. And Moses tells <a id="l818"></a>you expresly that a horn signifies an army. <em class="underline">The <a id="l819"></a>glory of Ioseph</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">is the firstling of his bullock <a id="l820"></a>&amp; his horns are the horns of a wild bull: which them <a id="l821"></a>he shall push the people together to the ends of the <a id="l822"></a>earth &amp; they are the ten thousands of Ephraim &amp; <a id="l823"></a>they are the thousands of Manasseh</em>. Deut. 33.17. And <a id="l824"></a>  <a id="l827"></a>So the horn which the Gentiles left up over the land <a id="l828"></a>of Iudah to scatter it is their army  &amp; the four <a id="l829"></a>horns of the same Gentiles which scattered Iudah &amp; Israel are the standing armies <a id="l830"></a>of four Gentile kingdoms Zech 1.18, 19, 21. And so Daniel &amp; Iohn take <a id="l831"></a>horns for the standing armies of kingdoms &amp; because every kingdom <a id="l832"></a>hath its proper standing army, they put the number of horns 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018v"> &lt;18v&gt; </span> for the number of kingdoms &amp;  represent the rise &amp; <a id="l833"></a>fall of the kingdom by the growing up &amp; breaking off of the horns. <a id="l834"></a>For they tell us expresly that the horns are Kings &amp; by Kings mean not <a id="l835"></a> single persons but military dominions or Kingdoms which respect to the military forces <a id="l836"></a> reigning over them. For the members wherewith Kingdoms fight &amp; <a id="l837"></a>push one another are not the persons of  Kings but their armies <a id="l838"></a>When Daniel tells the four Beasts are four Kings he means not four <a id="l839"></a>persons but four Kingdoms. When he tells us the Ram having two horns  are the Kings of Media &amp; Persia he means their military dominions seated in their armies <a id="l841"></a>For in the wars of Alexander the great when the He Goat <a id="l842"></a>broke the two horns of the Ram tis to be understood that he <a id="l843"></a>broke the  standing armies of Media &amp; Persia not their  Kings <a id="l844"></a>For they had then but one common King Darius. And so when he tells us <a id="l845"></a>that the Goat is the King of Greece &amp; the great horn is the first King <a id="l846"></a>he means that the Goat is the  Kingdom of Greece  con<a id="l847"></a>sisting of several   &amp; the great horn is the first of those <a id="l848"></a> Kingdoms. For he tells us that when the first horn <a id="l849"></a>was broken  whereas four stood up for it four kingdoms shall <a id="l850"></a>stand up out of the nation. The great horn or first king must be of the same <a id="l851"></a>kind which the four which  stood up in its room &amp; therefore not a person but a kingdom <a id="l852"></a>For Alexanders person was not succeeded by kingdoms but by per<a id="l853"></a>sons &amp; his kingdom by kingdoms. And so Daniel himself interprets <a id="l854"></a>it. And a mighty King shal stand up that shall rule which great domini<a id="l855"></a>on &amp; when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken &amp; divided <a id="l856"></a>towards the four winds of heaven. So then a horn of a Beast constantly <a id="l857"></a>signifies the military  force of a Kingdom &amp; when horns are <a id="l858"></a>numbered they signify that the Beast consists of so many <a id="l859"></a>kingdoms governed each by its proper standing army.  <a id="l860"></a> Whence the ten horns of the fourth Beast  <a id="l861"></a>which Daniel tells us are ten Kings, must signify a division of <a id="l862"></a> the fourth Monarchy into ten military Kingdoms, &amp; the <a id="l863"></a>eleventh horn which arose after the rest must be  <a id="l864"></a> another Kingdom. And so the little horn of the Goat which arose <a id="l865"></a>out one of the four horns &amp; grew exceeding great must be <a id="l866"></a>a  new Kingdom different from the four.</p>
<p id="par36">Now The four Monarchies in respect of  Dominion were <a id="l867"></a>successing &amp;  interfered which one another  by the conquest <a id="l868"></a>of one anothers people but in respect of their  proper nations &amp; <a id="l869"></a> countries they were  collateral &amp; distinct &amp; continued all together till the end. First the <a id="l870"></a>golden head reigned &amp; then the silver Beast   <a id="l871"></a>the brazen belly &amp; the iron leggs in order, but  these <a id="l872"></a> members ceased not which their reign. They all <a id="l873"></a>continued together (in respect of their distinct nations)  till the leggs had reigned &amp; the stone <a id="l874"></a> smote the Image  upon its feet &amp; brake in <a id="l875"></a>pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver &amp; the gold together <a id="l876"></a>&amp; the wind carried them all away like chaff; that is as Daniel inter<a id="l877"></a><br>prets it, till the new kingdom signified by the stone  break in pieces &amp; 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span> consume all the former kingdoms. So the four Beasts arose &amp; reigned <a id="l878"></a>one after another, but after the dominion of the thre first <a id="l879"></a>was taken away their lives were prolonged for a season <a id="l880"></a>&amp; time Dan. 7.12. And therefore the bodies of the Beasts <a id="l881"></a>that they may continue  distinct from one another  <a id="l882"></a>&amp; live all together after the dominion of the three first <a id="l883"></a>is taken away, must be placed in several nations, suppose <a id="l884"></a>the two first in Babylonia &amp; Persia &amp; the rest of the <a id="l885"></a>nations beyond Euphrates over which they reigned: the <a id="l886"></a>third in Greece, Asia,  Syria &amp; Egypt ( for these <a id="l887"></a>are the four heads &amp; four wings of the Leopard) &amp; by con<a id="l888"></a>sequence the fourth in Italy &amp; all the western  part of the Roman <a id="l889"></a>Empire. For thus  every Beast after his dominion was <a id="l890"></a>taken away by  the victories of the next might continue for a time to live under <a id="l891"></a>the dominion of his conqueror, the first under that of the second <a id="l892"></a>the second under  that of the third &amp; the third under that of the fourth. <a id="l893"></a> The Roman Empire therefore  <a id="l894"></a>in its greatness consisted of two Beasts, the third conquer<a id="l895"></a>ed by the fourth &amp; the fourth reigning over the third. <a id="l896"></a> But after the division of the Empire, the western <a id="l897"></a>Empire was adequately the fourth Beast &amp; the eastern the third. <a id="l898"></a>And this directs us to look for the ten horns within <a id="l899"></a>the  regions of the western Empire.</p>
<p id="par37">The same thing is confirmed by the Prophesy of <a id="l900"></a>Iohn, where the [] the Dragon first reigns alone &amp; at length the ten horned Beast <a id="l902"></a>rises out of the sea &amp; the Dragon gives him his throne <a id="l903"></a>&amp; thence forward the Dragon &amp; Beast are,  worshipped &amp; <a id="l904"></a> continue together &amp; till three froggs come out of the mouths <a id="l905"></a>of the Dragon Beast &amp; fals Prophet &amp; the Beast is cast into <a id="l906"></a>the lake of fire &amp; the Dragon into the bottomless pit.  <a id="l907"></a>The Dragon  is the Roman Empire (as interpreters <a id="l908"></a>agree) &amp; upon division of the Empire the Beasts or western <a id="l909"></a>Empire  rises out of the great Roman Sea  <a id="l910"></a>&amp; the Dragon leaves him his old throne Rome &amp; retires <a id="l911"></a>into the eastern Empire where he lives either with dominion <a id="l912"></a>or without till the end of the four Monarchies.ⓐ This Beast, <a id="l913"></a>saith Iohn, <em class="underline">was like  unto the Leopard &amp; his feet as the <a id="l914"></a>feet of the Bear &amp; his mouth as the mouth of the Lion</em> <a id="l915"></a>Apoc 13.2. He names Daniel's three first Beasts in order 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019v"> &lt;19v&gt; </span> backwards, &amp; to shew that the Apocalyptic Beast is of their <a id="l916"></a>kindred &amp; the fourth of them he assimilates him to them &amp; <a id="l917"></a>puts him in the fourth place in the room of Daniels fourth. <a id="l918"></a>He was like the Leopard, that is fierce &amp; terrible:  his <a id="l919"></a>feet were as the feet of the Bear that is flat &amp; fitted to <a id="l920"></a>stamp things which  in fighting as a Bear doth: his mouth <a id="l921"></a>was as the mouth of the Lyon, that is armed with great &amp; <a id="l922"></a>long teeth to tear &amp; devour as a Lyon doth. And by par<a id="l923"></a>taking of all these qualities he was neither Lion Bear nor <a id="l924"></a>Leopard but a strange monster of a different species. And be<a id="l925"></a>sides this he rose out of the sea &amp; had ten horns &amp; reigned <a id="l926"></a>42 months or three years &amp; an half &amp; was cast into the <a id="l927"></a>lake of fire &amp; the time of his end was when the Word of <a id="l928"></a>God came in heaven which many crowns on his head to rule the <a id="l929"></a>nations which a rod of iron &amp; reward the saints in judgment. <a id="l930"></a>All which things are the manifest character of Daniel's fourth <a id="l931"></a>Beast. For that Beast was dreadfull &amp; terrible &amp; strong ex<a id="l932"></a>ceedingly (like a Leopard) &amp; had great iron teeth &amp; broke in pieces (like a Lion) &amp; stamped <a id="l933"></a>the residue with his feet (like a Bear) &amp; was divers from all <a id="l934"></a>the beasts that were before it &amp; rose out of the great sea &amp; <a id="l935"></a>had ten horns &amp; reigned which his little horn three times &amp; <a id="l936"></a>an half, &amp; was cast into the burning flames &amp; the time <a id="l937"></a>of his end was when the judgment was set &amp; the books <a id="l938"></a>were opened &amp; the Son of man came into the clouds of hea<a id="l939"></a>ven to receive an universal &amp; everlasting dominion that <a id="l940"></a>all nations should serve him.  [ 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span>]</p>
<p id="par38">Now the reign of this fourth Beast is both by Dani<a id="l964"></a>el &amp; Iohn describes a double one.  In the first <a id="l965"></a>part of his reign he is united &amp; strong, in the second di<a id="l966"></a>vided  &amp; weak. The first part of his reign <a id="l967"></a>is by Daniel  represented <a id="l968"></a>by the iron leggs of the Image, the second by the feet <a id="l969"></a>&amp; toes mixed of iron &amp; clay. <em class="underline">And the fourth Kingdom,</em> <a id="l970"></a>saith he, <em class="underline">shall be strong as iron, forasmuch as iron <a id="l971"></a>breaketh in pieces &amp; subdueth all things. And whereas <a id="l972"></a>thou sawest the feet &amp; toes part of potters clay &amp; part <a id="l973"></a>of iron, the kingdom shall be divided – &amp; be partly strong <a id="l974"></a>&amp; partly brittle – &amp; they shall not cleave  one to <a id="l975"></a>another eaven as iron is not mixed with clay.</em> Dan. 2.40 <a id="l976"></a>The first part of the same reign is  by Iohn <a id="l977"></a>represented by the seven heads of the Beast reigning <a id="l978"></a>before the eighth rises out of the abyss; the second by the reign <a id="l979"></a>of  the eight with his horns  <em class="underline">The Beast that  sawest </em> saith Iohn, <em class="underline">was &amp; is not &amp; shall ascend out of the abyss</em>&amp; go in to perdition. – And (that is, he arose out of the sea, is now slain &amp; shall ascend ab  inferiso from hades or death &amp; go into the Lake of fire.) This the Angel speaks in respect of the future time considered as present in the vision.) <em class="underline">The seven heads,  are seven <a id="l980"></a>Kings: five are fallen &amp; one is &amp; the other is not <a id="l981"></a>yet come &amp; when he cometh he must continue a <a id="l982"></a>short space. And the Beast that was &amp; is not  he is the eight  &amp; is <a id="l984"></a>of the seven. And the ten horns which thou sawest are <a id="l985"></a>ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet but <a id="l986"></a>receive power as kings as the same time which the Beast</em> <a id="l987"></a>Iohn 17.8. So then the feet of the image are the Beast <a id="l988"></a>which  ascends out of the Abyss or Sea, &amp; by con<a id="l989"></a>sequence they are the western Empire from the time of the division. <a id="l990"></a> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020v"> &lt;20v&gt; </span>  This division began <a id="l993"></a>first between the sons of Constantine the great, but soon after was <a id="l994"></a>healed again for about 10 years &amp; then revived between Valentinian <a id="l995"></a>&amp; Valens A.C. 364 &amp; was completed   at the death of Theo<a id="l996"></a>dosius A.C. 395.    king<a id="l997"></a>  </p></div>
<div>
<p id="par39">If the Beast rise out of the sea upon the first division of the Dragon <a id="l1009"></a>thenceforward become the name of the Greek Empire, &amp; if at the <a id="l1010"></a>second division the Beast after he had been wounded to death <a id="l1011"></a>revive &amp; at the last division the Dragon give him his western <a id="l1012"></a>power &amp; throne  for ever: we are to expect <a id="l1013"></a>that this Beast soon after he  received this power, τὴν μίαν <a id="l1014"></a>ὡραν, as it were the same hour,  became divided into the ten kingdoms. For <a id="l1015"></a>since they are the horns of  Daniels fourth Beast, &amp; with one mind gave their <a id="l1016"></a>kingdom to Iohn's Beast, that is to compose his body &amp; were all <a id="l1017"></a>crowned on his head &amp; not on the Dragon's: they must all reign <a id="l1018"></a>within the regions of the western Empire. And this came truly to pass. For in <a id="l1019"></a>the years 408 &amp; 409, that is within 14 years after the Beast <a id="l1020"></a>began his  absolute reign, this Empire broke at once into ten  <a id="l1021"></a>kingdoms &amp; no more as you will perceive by the following history.</p></div>

<h2 id="hd7" class="cent">The Introduction <sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup></h2>
<p id="par41">The Iews seem to know but little  of the <a id="l1031"></a>Babylonian &amp; Persian Monarchies besides what they <a id="l1032"></a>have out of the books of the old Testament &amp; therefore <a id="l1033"></a>own no more kings nor years of kings then they <a id="l1034"></a>can find in those books. The kings they reccon <a id="l1035"></a>are only Nebuchadnezzar, Evilmerodach, Beshazzar, <a id="l1036"></a>Darius the Mede, Cyrus, Ahashuerus &amp; Darius the Persian <a id="l1037"></a>The last Darius they reccon to be the Artaxerxes in <a id="l1038"></a>whose reign Ezra &amp; Nehemiah came to Ierusalem <a id="l1039"></a>accounting Artaxerxes a common name of all the <a id="l1040"></a>Persian kings. For this they infer from Ezra's saying <a id="l1041"></a>that the temple was built by the commandment of <a id="l1042"></a>Cyrus &amp; Darius &amp;  Artaxerxes king of Persia. <a id="l1043"></a>Least they should make it built by more kings then <a id="l1044"></a>two &amp; finisht after the reign of Darius they make Artaxerxes here to be the common name of Cyrus &amp; Darius. Nebuchad<a id="l1045"></a>nezzar, they say, reigned 45 years, eight which Ie<a id="l1046"></a>hojakim &amp; 37 afterwards (Ier. 1.25. &amp; 2 King. 25.<a id="l1047"></a>37) &amp; Belshazzar reigned three (Dan. 8.1) &amp; thence <a id="l1048"></a>to Evilmerodach they allot 23 years to make up <a id="l1049"></a>71. For because the prophesy of the seventy years <a id="l1050"></a>was given in the first year of Nebuchadnezzar &amp; <a id="l1051"></a>Ierusalem taken (as they reccon) in his second year, <a id="l1052"></a>they date those seventy years from that second <a id="l1053"></a>year to the end of Belshazzars reign. Then to Da<a id="l1054"></a>rius the Mede whom they reccon the first king <a id="l1055"></a>of the Modo-persian Empire, they attribute but <a id="l1056"></a>one year or at most but two (Dan. 9.1) to <a id="l1057"></a>Cyrus three years incomplete (Dan. 10.1) to Athashu

And the whole <a id="l1065"></a>time of the Persian  Monarchy during the standing of the second temple untill the <a id="l1066"></a>reign of Alexander the great  <a id="l1067"></a>they reccon but 34 years.

He dresses them <a id="l1364"></a>by dictating seven admonitory Epistles to them with relation to seven <a id="l1365"></a>successive states of the primitive church after she began to leave her <a id="l1366"></a>first love &amp; before the fall of the first temple, viz<sup>t</sup> to Ephesus in the <a id="l1367"></a>reign of Dioclesian next before his persecution, to Smyrna in that persecution, to <a id="l1368"></a>Pergamus in the reign of Constantine, to Thyatira in the reign of his sons <a id="l1369"></a>during the division of the Empire, to Sardis in the reign of Constantius over <a id="l1370"></a>the whole Empire, to Philadelphia in the reign of Iulian the Apostate, &amp; <a id="l1371"></a>to Laodicea in the reign of Valentinian &amp; Valens. Five of these Churches <a id="l1372"></a>are found fault with &amp; amonished to repent  &amp; threatned if they do <a id="l1373"></a>not repent: these  five for want of repentence ceased with the first Temple <a id="l1374"></a>&amp; the other two, viz<sup>t</sup> the churches of Smyrna &amp; Philadelphia which were not <a id="l1375"></a>admonished to repent nor found fault with, continued all the times of the <a id="l1376"></a>second Temple &amp; represented the two Witnesses. The Church of Smyrna <a id="l1377"></a>in the times of Dioclesians persecution was in great affliction &amp; testified <a id="l1378"></a>against the persecutors; &amp; so did the church of Philadelphia in the reign <a id="l1379"></a>of Iulan the Apostate. And therefore the two Candlesticks which represent <a id="l1380"></a>these churches are proper types of the two churches or witnesses during all the  <a id="l1381"></a>times of the second Temple. For the two witnesses are not new churches <a id="l1382"></a>but a propagation of the old Church, Christ having but one church <a id="l1383"></a>catholick from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p id="par55">After the dressing of the Lamps  Iohn is called up to the Temple <a id="l1384"></a>by the sound of a Trumpet to see the Morning worship. And there he sees God sitting upon the Ark between <a id="l1385"></a>the Cherubims, &amp; round about the throne 24 Exhedræ in the Priests court for the Princes <a id="l1386"></a>of the 24 courses of the Priests; &amp; the flame of the altar &amp; musick of the <a id="l1387"></a>temple proceeding as it were out of the throne, &amp; seven lamps burning <a id="l1388"></a>before the throne, &amp; a sea of glass like crystal before the throne, &amp; before <a id="l1389"></a>&amp; behind the throne &amp; on either side  of it, four Beasts full of eyes representing the <a id="l1390"></a>people of Israel in the four sides of the peoples court &amp; they rest not <a id="l1391"></a>day &amp; night, that is at the morning &amp; evening sacrifices, saying Holy Holy <a id="l1392"></a>Holy Lord God of Sabaoth who is &amp; was &amp; is to come; &amp; in the right hand of <a id="l1393"></a>him that sat upon the throne a book written within &amp; on the back side, sealed <a id="l1394"></a>with seven seales alluding to the book of the law which was laid up in the <a id="l1395"></a>side of the Ark, &amp;  being the book of prophesy which Daniel sealed till the time <a id="l1396"></a>of the end. And Iohn looked, &amp; lo (in allusion to the morning sacrifice)  in the </p>
