<p id="par3">We the Warden Master Worker &amp; Controller of his Majesties Mints do <a id="l1"></a>most humbly represent that  by our Charter confirmed by <a id="l2"></a>many Kings for above five hundred years past all the Officers Workers Moneyers &amp; <a id="l3"></a>other Ministers of the Mints are incorporated throughout all England into one <a id="l4"></a>body under the Government of a Warden with freedome from Arrests &amp; other <a id="l5"></a>great Privileges <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> without subjection of our Corporation to the particular Government or Iurisdiction <a id="l6"></a>of the Tower of London or its liberties. And that the Kings of England have given us the <a id="l7"></a>ground &amp; houses between the Lines in the said Tower  out of their <a id="l8"></a>royal favour &amp; for our greater security &amp; not to deprive us of those <a id="l9"></a>their other royal grants above mentioned &amp; bring us into subjection trouble <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> danger . And also that his Majesty <a id="l10"></a>by the Indenture  of the Mint <a id="l11"></a>doth will &amp; streightly charge all officers of the Tower that all the Officers <a id="l12"></a>of the Mint &amp; their servants &amp; all importers of gold &amp; silver shall have free ingress &amp; regress &amp; issue by <a id="l13"></a>the Gates &amp; through the same Tower &amp; Franchises thereof inward &amp; <a id="l14"></a>outward at all times without any arresting disturbance letting or gain<a id="l15"></a>saying of the chief Governour Co<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ns<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>table Lieuetenant or the Porter or any other <a id="l16"></a>Officer or Person whatsoever he be for any manner of debt matter <a id="l17"></a>or cause whatsoever it be &amp; without any thing given to any of them <a id="l18"></a>or to any other to have such entry or issue.</p>
    
<p id="par4">And we further represent to your Lordships that we have at all times <a id="l19"></a>in every thing shewed due respect to my Lord Lucas as chief Governour <a id="l20"></a>of the Tower  <a id="l22"></a>And therefore we are concerned that we should be now forced to represent <a id="l23"></a>to your Lordships that on Satturday the third Instant, Philip Atherton one <a id="l24"></a>of our Labourers was apprehended in our Melting house   without <a id="l25"></a>the licence or knowledge of our Warden by Roger Bayly a Constable by <a id="l26"></a>virtue of a Warrant of Robert Bateman Esqr one of his Majesties Iusti<a id="l27"></a>ces of the Peace for the Liberties of the Tower backt with another Warrant <a id="l28"></a>of my Lord Lucas &amp; is now detained in New Prison from the Kings <a id="l29"></a>service. And that on the same day one of the Warders, to let out of <a id="l30"></a>the Mint some people which he had brought in, seized the Gate of the <a id="l31"></a>Mint &amp; took the Porters son by the throat; whence arose a fray between <a id="l32"></a>them which caused such a tumultuous concourse of people as rendred the <a id="l33"></a>money unsafe which was then coming down the street of the Mint in Trays <a id="l34"></a>&amp; that the said Warder threatens revenge upon the Porters son wherever 
    <a id="l35"></a>he meets him &amp; my Lord Lucas himself threatens further  (notwithstanding his <a id="l37"></a>Majesties  will &amp;  command to the contrary exprest in the Charter &amp; Indenture of the Mint) to

<p id="par5">And we further represent to your Lordships that <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>t<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>he Centinals lately <a id="l39"></a>appointed to guard the door of the Engravers working room where the Dies &amp; Puncheons  <a id="l40"></a>were seized &amp; kept by the Warden had orders to permit entrance as well to <a id="l41"></a>my Lord Lucas as to the Warden And that our Engraver M<sup>r</sup> Harris <a id="l42"></a>having sollicited my Lord to turn M<sup>r</sup> Roettiers family out of the Mint <a id="l43"></a>&amp; my Lord having divers times prest the Warden to do it &amp; threatned to apprehend M<sup>r</sup> Iames Roettiers &amp; at length <a id="l44"></a>an Information being made  that King Iames was the<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>re<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>n<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> seen in <a id="l45"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Roettiers House, My Lord did thereupon seize the Gates of the Mint <a id="l46"></a>&amp; search M<sup>r</sup> Roettiers house two several days without giving notice to <a id="l47"></a>any Officer of the Mint of his intended search, &amp; now demands a list <a id="l48"></a>of the names of all persons belonging to the Mint, in order to search <a id="l49"></a>their houses at pleasure, under pretence that they entertein such <a id="l50"></a>lodgers as belong not to the Mint &amp; are dangerous to the Tower. Where <a id="l51"></a>as his Majesty by the Indenture of the Mint places in  <a id="l52"></a>us the care of enquiring after such as live or inhabit in the Mint without our licence <a id="l53"></a>or other right &amp; impowers us to turn them out, &amp; military searches without us have not hitherto been <a id="l54"></a>used so far as we know, nor are necessary to the safety of the Tower <a id="l55"></a>the Mint being shut up on all sides by the Lines &amp; we being ready to <a id="l56"></a>search either alone or with his Lordship upon notice of any danger, &amp; if military <a id="l57"></a>searches without us should be now allowed &amp; Constables let in upon us at pleasure we cannot undertake <a id="l58"></a>any longer the charge of the Dyes &amp; Puncheons &amp; Marking Engins <a id="l59"></a>&amp; other coyning Tools &amp; of the Gold &amp; Silver which lyes scattered about <a id="l60"></a>in all the rooms apperteining to the coynage, nor  will Merchants &amp; other <a id="l61"></a>Importers think their estates secure in the Mint.  We were placed in a <a id="l62"></a>Garrison not that the Exchange <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Treasury of the Nation might not be invaded by <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>our<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Guards but guarded in our custody from all manner of invasion.</p>
    
    
<p id="par6">And we further represent that the Centi<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>nals<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> begin to be rather <a id="l63"></a>a grievance then security to us. The Press-room about a fortnight ago <a id="l64"></a>was in danger of being robbed one of the Locks of the door being broken, which makes a suspicion <a id="l66"></a>that the Centinal was at <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>leas<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>tprivy to it, so that the Mo<a id="l67"></a>neyers are now fain to lodge two Labourers in the Press room for their security which <a id="l68"></a>they never thought necessary to do before. And about the same time two of our houses <a id="l69"></a>being greatly disturbed at Midnight by a drunken Officer upon the Guards who drew his sword brake the <a id="l70"></a>window &amp; would have forced himself into one of the houses &amp; running after one of our servants made a <a id="l71"></a>pass at him &amp; ran him through the cloaths &amp; a Centi<a id="l72"></a>nal being called either to come to their assistance or to call his Corpo<a id="l73"></a>rall with a File of Musketeers, the Centinal would not stirnor call. And when <a id="l74"></a>a Corporal &amp; File of Musketeers were called by another person, the <a id="l75"></a> endeavoured to perswade a by-stander to beare false witness for <a id="l76"></a>turning the blame upon our men. And my Lord Lucas instead of <a id="l77"></a>being told the truth of such matters is only informed by the soldiers <a id="l78"></a>that our men get drunk &amp; affront the Centinals, &amp;  has upon such informations or<a id="l79"></a>dered the Centinals to fire at us. Whereas heretofore the Centi<a id="l80"></a>nals used not to be set singly as now, but to walk the Mint-street <a id="l81"></a>all night in a body strong enough to apprehend any drunken or <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p410r"> &lt;410r&gt; </span>disorderly person without firing at him.  For why should we lose a <a id="l82"></a>good Artificer upon pretence of his being drunk, when the best are most addicted to that <a id="l83"></a>crime &amp; it was never yet made death? Or why should every Centinal be impowered under any feigned <a id="l84"></a>pretence to shoot his enemy or any other man that complains, if such <a id="l85"></a>bloody discipline may safely be avoyded? Or why should the people who live in <a id="l86"></a>the Mint be so terrified as  to leave their habitations in it to the neglect of the Kings <a id="l87"></a>service &amp; insecurity of the treasure.</p>
    
    <p id="par7">And we are further constrained to represent that the Warden on <a id="l88"></a>thursday last  telling my Lord Lucas the misdemeanours <a id="l89"></a>committed in the Mint by this drunken Officer, his Lordship &amp; the Deputy <a id="l90"></a>Governour together did the next day being Friday give strict charge <a id="l91"></a>to his Warders not to suffer either meat or drink to be brought <a id="l92"></a>into the Tower to workmen in the Melting-house or Press-room, &amp; <a id="l93"></a>that if any were sent for, they should take it away from the <a id="l94"></a>messengers &amp; give it to the soldiers, his Lordship pretending that <a id="l95"></a>the workmen abuse the same to excess &amp; sell it to others, (which we never heard of) <a id="l96"></a>&amp; that his Warders have an unreasonable trouble in examining persons that go in &amp; out.. And this  order being strictly <a id="l97"></a>put in execution gave so great discontent to the workmen, that but <a id="l98"></a>for the perswasion of the Officers of the Mint they would have <a id="l99"></a>left off their work that day &amp; the two next days  instead of  nine potts were not able to melt above six  <a id="l101"></a>&amp; say they  can work no more unless they may have speedy redress. </p>
    
<p id="par8">And we are further to acquaint your Lordships that my Lord <a id="l104"></a>Lucas represents that he doth not invade the Privileges of the <a id="l105"></a>Mint but that the power which he useth over us is asserted by <a id="l106"></a>ancient Records &amp; Court Rolls preserved in the Tower, </p>
    
<p id="par9">All which we most humbly desire your Lordships according to your <a id="l108"></a>great wisdomes to take into serious consideration in order to our <a id="l109"></a>releife &amp; pray that  the Records <a id="l110"></a>&amp; Court Rolls alledged by  his Lordship  may be produced &amp; compared <a id="l111"></a>with our Charter &amp; Indenture  &amp; the rights between the Tower <a id="l112"></a>&amp; the Mint thence adjusted stated &amp; limited so that both parties <a id="l113"></a>may know their Duties Privileges &amp; Powers in respect of each <a id="l114"></a>other for conserving a good correspondence &amp; friendship between  <a id="l115"></a>them for the future &amp; that what has hitherto  by <a id="l116"></a>mistake been done against us may not be drawn into precedent <a id="l117"></a>hereafter.</p>
