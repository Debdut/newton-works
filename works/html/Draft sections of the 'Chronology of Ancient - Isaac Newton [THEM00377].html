<p id="par1" class="i0">rians, the rapture of Europa happened not long before the <a id="l1"></a>building of Solomon's Temple. The voyage of Menelaus might <a id="l2"></a>be in pursuit of Paris &amp; Helena twenty years before the destructi<a id="l3"></a>on of Troy. Solomon therefore reigned in the times between the <a id="l4"></a>raptures of Europa &amp; Helena &amp; Europa &amp; her brother Cadmus <a id="l5"></a>flourished in the days of David, Minos the son of Europa <a id="l6"></a>flourished in the days of Solomon; &amp; his children of Minos, <a id="l7"></a>(namely Androgeus his eldest son, Deucalion his youngest son <a id="l8"></a>&amp; one of the Argonauts, Ariadne the mistress of Theseus <a id="l9"></a>&amp; Bacchus, &amp; Phædra the wife of Theseus,) flourished in the <a id="l10"></a>days of Rehoboam Abia &amp; Asa.</p>
<p id="par2">The Expedition of Sesostris was one generation <a id="l11"></a>older then the Argonautic Expedition. For in his return <a id="l12"></a>back into Egypt, he left Æetes at Colchos, &amp; Æetes reigned <a id="l13"></a>there till the Argonautic Expedition,  &amp; <a id="l14"></a>Prometheus was left with a body of men at Mount Caucasus <a id="l15"></a>by Sesostris &amp; after thirty years released by Hercules the <a id="l16"></a>Argonaut. At the return of Sesostris into Egypt, his brother <a id="l17"></a>Danaus fled from him into Greece with his fifty daughters in <a id="l18"></a>a long ship, after the pattern of which the ship Argo was <a id="l19"></a>built, &amp; Argus the son of Danaus was reputed the master <a id="l20"></a>builder. And Nauplias the Argonaut was born in Greece <a id="l21"></a>of Amymone one of the daughters of Danaus soon after <a id="l22"></a>their arrival. And two others of the daughters of Danaus <a id="l23"></a>married Archander &amp; Archilites the sons of Achæus <a id="l24"></a>the son of Creusa the daughter of Erechtheus king of <a id="l25"></a>Athens &amp; therefore the daughters of Danaus were three ge<a id="l26"></a>nerations younger then Erechtheus &amp; by consequence contempo<a id="l27"></a>rary to Theseus the son of Ægeus the adopted son of Pandion <a id="l28"></a>the son of Erechtheus, &amp; Theseus in the time of the Argo<a id="l29"></a>nautic expedition was about  or 52 years of age. For he stole <a id="l30"></a>Helena<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> just before that  Expedition being then fifty <a id="l33"></a>years old, &amp; she but seven or, as some say, ten. Whence the expedition of Theseus to Crete <span class="ns">☉</span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 1r &gt; </span> <span class="ns">☉</span> he being then a beardless young man)<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from higher up f 1r resumes &gt; </span> about nine or ten years after the death of Solomon.  <a id="l34"></a>Perithous the son of Ixion helped Theseus to steale Helena, &amp; then<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> Theseus <a id="l36"></a>went with Perithous <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> to steale Proserpina the daughter of Aidoneus <a id="l37"></a>king of the Molossi, &amp; was imprisoned by Aidoneus, &amp; whilst <a id="l38"></a>he lay in prison, Castor &amp; Pollux released their sister Helena <a id="l39"></a>&amp; captivated Æthra the mother of Theseus, &amp; then sailed which <a id="l40"></a>the Argonauts. Now the daughters of Danaus being contemporary <a id="l41"></a>to Theseus, &amp; some of their sons being Argonauts, Danaus with his <a id="l42"></a>daughters fled from his brother Sesostris into Greece about one genera<a id="l43"></a>tion before the Argonautic Expedition &amp; therefore Sesostris returned <a id="l44"></a> into Egypt in the reign of Rehoboam &amp; so was Sesac. For both <a id="l45"></a>of them were kings of all Egypt at one &amp; the same time, &amp; they <a id="l46"></a>agree not only in time but also in their actions, &amp; conquests. God gave Sesac פפלבות מארצות the kingdoms of the earth 2 Chron. 12. Where <a id="l47"></a>Herodotus describes the Expedition of Sesostris, Iosephus<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> tells us that <a id="l49"></a>he described the Expedition of Sesac &amp; attributed his actions to <a id="l50"></a>Sesostris, erring only in the name of the King. Corruptions of names <a id="l51"></a>are frequent in history. Sesostris was otherwise called Sesochris <a id="l52"></a>Sesoosis, Sethosis, Sesonchis, Sesonchosis. Take away the Greek <a id="l53"></a>terminations &amp; the name becomes Sesost, Sesoch, Sesoos, Sethos, <a id="l54"></a>Sesonch: which names differ very little from Sesach. As the <a id="l55"></a>Greeks changed Moph into Memphys so they changed Sesac <a id="l56"></a>into Sesonchis. Sesostris therefore being the same king with Sesak he was of about the same age with Solomons Queen &amp; her little sister &amp; so might be their brother.</p>
<p id="par3">Sesac came out of Egypt in the fift year of Rehoboam <a id="l57"></a>&amp; spent nine years in that Expedition,<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> &amp; therefore returned <a id="l58"></a>back into Egypt in the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam. At that time <a id="l59"></a>he left Æetes at Colchos; &amp; Phrixus &amp; his sister Helle fled from <a id="l60"></a>Ino the daughter of Cadmus to Æstes soon after. Ino was therefore <a id="l61"></a>alive in the 14<sup>th</sup>year of Rehoboam, &amp; by consequence her father <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> Cadmus flourished in the reign of David &amp; not earlier. Cadmus <a id="l62"></a>was the father of Polydorus, the father of Labdacus, the <a id="l63"></a>father of Laius, the father of Oedipus, the father of <a id="l64"></a>Eteocles &amp; Polynices who in their youth slew one another <a id="l65"></a>in the war of the seven captains at Thebes about eight or ten <a id="l66"></a>years after the Argonautic Expedition. And Tersan<a id="l67"></a>der the son of Polynices warred at Troy. These generations <a id="l68"></a>being by the eldest sons of they be recconed at about  25 years <a id="l69"></a>to a generation, they . will place the birth of Polydorus upon the  sixt yeare of Davids reign or thereabouts Androgeus <a id="l72"></a>the eldest son of Minos upon his overcoming in the Athenæa <a id="l73"></a>or quadrennial games at Athens in his youth was perfidious<a id="l74"></a>ly slain out of envy &amp; Minos thereupon made war upon the <a id="l75"></a>Athenians, &amp; compelled them to send every eighth year to <a id="l76"></a>Crete seven beardless youths &amp; as many young Virgins to be <a id="l77"></a>given as a reward to him that should get the victory in the <a id="l78"></a>like games instituted in Crete in honour of Androgeus. <a id="l79"></a>These games seem to have been celebrated in the beginning of <a id="l80"></a>the Octaeteris &amp; the Athenea in the beginning of the Tetra<a id="l81"></a>eteris then brought into Crete &amp; Greece by the Phænicians. And <a id="l82"></a>upon the third payment of this tribute of children, that is, about <a id="l83"></a>twenty years after the death of Androgeus Theseus became Victor <a id="l84"></a>&amp; returned  from Crete with Ariadne the daughter of Minos <a id="l85"></a>&amp; coming to the island Naxus or Dia, Ariadne<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> was there <a id="l88"></a>taken from him by Glaucus a commander at sea &amp; became <a id="l89"></a>the mistress of the great Bacchus &amp; by him had two sons <a id="l90"></a>Phlias &amp; Eumedon who were Argonauts. Minos was therefore <a id="l91"></a>about 65 or 70 years old when Theseus overcame; &amp; so was born about the middle of Davids reign &amp; his <a id="l92"></a>mother Europa &amp; her brother Cadmus came into Crete &amp; <a id="l93"></a>Greece  a little before, &amp; Androgeus was slain  &amp; Theseus born about the 28<sup>th</sup> or 30<sup>th</sup> year of Solomon. And Dædalus</p>
<p id="par4">Polydorus<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> the son of Cadmus married Nicteis the daughter <a id="l94"></a>of Nicteus a native of Greece &amp; dying left his kingdom &amp; young son Labdacus <a id="l95"></a>under the administration of Nicteus. Then Epopeus king of <a id="l96"></a>Ægialus, afterwards called Sicyon stole Antiopa the daughter <a id="l97"></a>of Nicteus, &amp; thereupon made war upon him, &amp; in a battel <a id="l98"></a>wherein Nicteus overcame, both were wounded &amp; died soon <a id="l99"></a>after. Nicteus left the tuition of Labdacus &amp; administration <a id="l100"></a>of the kingdom to his brother Lycus, and Epopeus  or (as <a id="l101"></a>Hyginus <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> calls him) Epaphus the Sicyonian) left his kingdom to Lamedon, <a id="l103"></a>who presently ended the war by sending home Antiopa, &amp; <a id="l104"></a>she in returning home brought  forth Amphion &amp; Zethus. <a id="l105"></a>Labdacus being grown up received the kingdom from Lycus, <a id="l106"></a>&amp; after soon dying left it again to his administration. <a id="l107"></a>When Amphion &amp; Zethus were about 20 years old, at the <a id="l108"></a>instigation of their mother Antiopa, they killed Lycus &amp; <a id="l109"></a>made Laius the young son of Labdacus fly to Pelops &amp; <a id="l110"></a>seized the city Thebes &amp; compassed it with a wall.

Amphion &amp; Zethus, Niobe <a id="l114"></a>&amp; Pelops, Lamedon &amp; Laius were therefore two little gene<a id="l115"></a>rations older then the Argonauts, &amp; Epopeus the father of Amphion &amp; Zethus was contemporary <a id="l116"></a>to Polydorus.

He seems to have followed the <a id="l444"></a>opinion of the people of Naxus who made Bacchus two <a id="l445"></a>generations older then Theseus &amp; for that end feigned <a id="l446"></a>two Minoses &amp; two Ariadnes. For by the consent of all <a id="l447"></a>antiquity. Osiris &amp; Bacchus were one &amp; the same king <a id="l448"></a>of Egypt. This is affirmed by the Ægyptians as well as <a id="l449"></a>by the Greeks. <sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> And some of the ancient Mythologists <a id="l450"></a>as  Eumolpus &amp; Orpheus called Osiris by the <a id="l451"></a>names of Dionysus &amp; Syrius. Osiris was king of all <a id="l452"></a>Egypt &amp; a great conqueror &amp; came over the Hellespont <a id="l453"></a>in the days of Triptolemus &amp; subdued Thrace &amp; there killed <a id="l454"></a>Lycurgus &amp; therefore his expedition falls in with that of <a id="l455"></a>Bacchus. Osiris Bacchus &amp; Sesostris lived about the same time <a id="l456"></a>&amp; by the relation of historians were all of them kings of <a id="l457"></a>all Egypt, &amp; reigned at Thebes &amp; adorned that city &amp; <a id="l458"></a>were very potent by land &amp; sea. All three were great <a id="l459"></a>conquerers &amp; carried on their conquests by land  through Asia <a id="l460"></a>as far as India. All three came over the Hellespont &amp; <a id="l461"></a>were there in danger of losing their army. All three <a id="l462"></a>conquered Thrace &amp; there put a stop to their victories <a id="l463"></a>&amp; returned back from thence into Egypt. All three left <a id="l464"></a>pillars with inscriptions in their conquests. And therefore <a id="l465"></a>all three must be one &amp; the same king of Egypt, &amp; this <a id="l466"></a>king can be no other then Sesac. All Egypt including <a id="l467"></a>Thebais Æthiopia &amp; Libya, had no common king before <a id="l468"></a>the expulsion of the shepherds who reigned in the lower <a id="l469"></a>Egypt, no conqueror of Syria India Asia &amp; Europe before <a id="l470"></a>Sesac. The sacred history admits of no Egyptian conqueror <a id="l471"></a>of Palestine before this king.</p>
