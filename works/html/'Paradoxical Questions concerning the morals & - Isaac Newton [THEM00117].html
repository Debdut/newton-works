Thus far Athanasius  So then the <a id="l136"></a>story of Arius's death was first broached by Athanasius at that time <a id="l137"></a>when  Arianism  was  countenanced by the Emperor <a id="l138"></a> &amp; by all mortals  &amp; by consequence  after the compliance <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>of<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l139"></a>the Council of Ariminum,  &amp; Atha<a id="l140"></a>nasius pretended no other author for it then Macarius a dead <a id="l141"></a>man &amp; propounded it amongst his ignorant &amp; credulous Monks <a id="l142"></a>with much timorousness charging them to retu<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>rn<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l143"></a>the writing quickly to him within letting any copys be  taken least it should  at length get into such hands <a id="l145"></a>as he could not trust. ffor, saith he, it is not safe that it should come to posterity. But a while after when the story was <a id="l146"></a>once spread abroad so that he might tell it within  danger of being reputed its author, he tells it again in his first Oration  <a id="l147"></a>without any such caution. </p>
<p id="par4">Now, the reasons which make me suspect the truth of <a id="l148"></a>this story are these.</p>
<p id="par5">1.  Because the prayer of Macarius is contrary to the temper &amp; <a id="l149"></a>spirit of true Christianity &amp; it is not likely that God would <a id="l150"></a>hear a wicked prayer.</p>

<p id="par15">These are the reasons which incline me to suspect <a id="l250"></a>the story of the death of Arius: And whilst Athanasius <a id="l251"></a>wrote his book de synodis Arimini et Seleuciæ  <a id="l252"></a>long after the death of Macarius &amp; therein relates the <a id="l253"></a>reception of Arius at Ierusalem: I suspect also that he <a id="l254"></a>knew nothing then of the story of Arius dying  out <a id="l255"></a>of communion &amp; therefore had it not from Macarius <a id="l256"></a>as he pretends but  invented it himself. </p>

<h2 id="hd3" class="cent">Quest.  2 <a id="l288"></a><br>Whether the Meletians deserved that ill Character <a id="l289"></a>which Athanasius gave them.</h2>
<p id="par17">In Dioclesian's Persecution there arose a  contension between Peter <a id="l290"></a>the Bishop of Alexandria &amp;  Meletius the first of the Bishops  under him which caused a schism in the Churches of Egypt <a id="l294"></a>both parties notwithstanding keeping communion with the Chur<a id="l295"></a>ches abroad. When Athanasius succeeded in the Bishopric <a id="l296"></a>of Alexandria he was accused of tyrannical behaviour <a id="l297"></a>towards the Meletians so as in the time of the Sacrament to break the communion cup <a id="l298"></a>of one Ischyras a Meletian Presbyter in Mareote &amp; sub<a id="l299"></a>vert the communion table &amp; cause the Church to be speedily <a id="l300"></a>demolished, &amp; some time after to kill Arsenius a Bishop the successor <a id="l301"></a>of Meletus in Hypsalita. Whereupon the Meletians accusing Athanasius he <a id="l302"></a>was tryed &amp; condemned in the Council of Tyre &amp; banished <a id="l303"></a>by the Emperor Constantine the great. And this caused great <a id="l304"></a>enmity between  Athanasius &amp; the Meletians.  Athanasius therefore in his second Apology<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>  gives this cha<a id="l310"></a>racter of Meletius,  that  he was, by  Peter the <a id="l311"></a>Bishop of Alexandria  in a common Synod of the Bishops <a id="l312"></a>convicted of many crimes &amp; particularly that he had <a id="l313"></a>sacrificed to Idols &amp; for these things deposed &amp; that he there<a id="l314"></a>upon made a  schism  so that his followers instead of Christians were <a id="l316"></a>called Meletians. But Epiphanius  <a id="l317"></a>relates the original of the schism much otherwise. ffor <a id="l318"></a>he  calls Meletius a Confessor &amp;  saith <a id="l319"></a>that when he &amp; Peter &amp; other martyrs &amp; confessors <a id="l320"></a>were in prison together, there arose a dispute about the <a id="l321"></a>reception of lapsed persons, Peter out of mercy being for a speedy <a id="l322"></a>reception &amp; Meletius &amp; Peleus &amp; many other martyrs <a id="l323"></a>&amp; confessors  out of zeal for  piety being for a <a id="l324"></a>competent time of penitence before they were received, so that the sincerity  of their penitence  might first appear, &amp; <a id="l325"></a>thereupon they divided, the greater part following <a id="l326"></a>Meletius. Afterwards Peter suffered martyrdome &amp; Me<a id="l327"></a>letius for some time was condemned to the mines. </p>
<p id="par18">Now that which makes me suspect the relation <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010v"> &lt;10v&gt; </span> of Athanasius is first because the character  given by the <a id="l328"></a>greatest enemy is always the most to be suspected &amp; y<sup>n</sup> <a id="l329"></a>because the Council of Nice  did not receive Meletius &amp; his <a id="l331"></a>party into communion as they would have done had they <a id="l332"></a>been excommunicate before, but  without any absolution continued  them  in their bishopricks &amp; only for putting an end to the <a id="l335"></a>schism confined  Meletius to his city &amp; deprived him of the <a id="l336"></a>power of ordeining, as you may see in the epistle of this <a id="l337"></a>Council to the Churches of Egypt.<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup>  ffor if  Meletius &amp; his party con<a id="l338"></a>tinued in communion without ever being absolved <a id="l339"></a>from excommunication (as it's plain by that epistle of <a id="l340"></a>the council of Nice that they did) then they were <a id="l341"></a>never excommunicate, &amp; if  so, then the <a id="l342"></a>story of Athanasius about their being excommunicate  <a id="l343"></a> for various crimes is a fiction.</p>

<h2 id="hd4" class="cent">Quest. 3 <a id="l344"></a><br>Whether the Council of Tyre &amp; Ierusalem was not an <a id="l345"></a> orthodox authentic Council bigger then that of Nice</h2>
<p id="par19">The friends of Athanasius endeavour all they can, <a id="l346"></a>for his credit to diminish this Council &amp; make it a <a id="l347"></a>Conventicle of a few Bishops selected by  his enemies <a id="l348"></a>for oppressing him. So Socrates tells us it consisted of <a id="l349"></a>but 60 Bishops. And yet by considering earlier records <a id="l350"></a>I suspect it was as big or bigger than the Council of <a id="l351"></a>Nice. For the designe of this Council being very great <a id="l352"></a>it needed great credit &amp; authority to support it. They <a id="l353"></a>were  not only to examin the  cause of Athanasius but <a id="l354"></a>also to receive into communion Arius &amp; Euzoius with their <a id="l355"></a>followers in Egypt as men who had been opprest by a fals <a id="l356"></a>representation of their faith: &amp; it was an <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup>  ancient Canon of <a id="l357"></a>the  Church, as well as a necessary one, that no man <a id="l358"></a>should be received by a less number of Bishops than those <a id="l359"></a>by which he had been  ejected. And therefore  the Em<a id="l361"></a>peror sent his letters  into all the Eastern Em<a id="l362"></a>pire requiring the attendance of the Bishops that the Council might be full. For this the 80 eastern <a id="l363"></a>Bishops in the letter which at their return from the Council <a id="l364"></a>of Sardica they wrote at Philippolis, affirm, in these words <a id="l365"></a><em class="underline">Concilium … post alterum annum in Tyro propter Athanasij <a id="l366"></a>facinora necessariò iterum celebratur. Advenerunt Episcopi <a id="l367"></a>de Macedonia &amp; de Pannonia Bithynia &amp; omnibus partibus <a id="l368"></a>Orientis, Imperatoris jussione constricti</em>. The eastern Bishops <a id="l369"></a>objected against Athanasius that by returning to his Bishopric <a id="l370"></a> without being restored by as many Bishops as had deposed <a id="l371"></a>him he had violated the ancient Canon: but the friends of <a id="l372"></a>Athanasius never retorted the accusation upon the Eastern <a id="l373"></a>Bishops as if they had  broken the same <a id="l374"></a>Canon in receiving the Arians at Tyre. In the times next after <a id="l375"></a>the Council the Athanasians never excepted against <a id="l376"></a>it for not being big enough. They never desired that <a id="l377"></a>a fuller council should be called in the East to examin <a id="l378"></a>the Acts of this: but as if a fuller could not well be <a id="l379"></a>called there, or, if called, would not be for their advan<a id="l380"></a>tage, they appealed to the West. And thereupon arose a <a id="l381"></a>quarrel, not between the West &amp; a few Bishops of the East <a id="l382"></a>but between the Eastern &amp; western Churches,  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> But let's hear how Euse<a id="l387"></a>bius who was in both Councils &amp; so is a good witnesse, describes this &amp; compares it with <a id="l388"></a>the other. For he tells us how the remoter regions of <a id="l389"></a> Macedonia, Pannonia, Mæsia &amp; Persia <a id="l390"></a>sent their Metropolitans thither &amp; then adds <sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup>  Bithyni <a id="l391"></a>quoque et Thraces præsentia sua conventum ornabant <a id="l392"></a>nec deerant &amp; Ciliciæ Episcopis clarissimi quique.

<p id="par33">In all the times of the Controversy about the Council of Tyre <a id="l715"></a>I cannot find that Athanasius  or his friends pre<a id="l716"></a>tended  that Arsenius had been seen alive by any <a id="l717"></a>living witnesses.

</div>
<div>
<p id="par38">Now the truth of this Epistle I suspect for these <a id="l753"></a>reasons. ffirst because Athanasius &amp; his friends knew <a id="l754"></a>nothing of  this evidence  in the Councils of Alexan<a id="l755"></a>dria Rome &amp; Sardica. So many living witnesses of Arsenius's <a id="l756"></a>being alive &amp; the proof of it by some of the witnesses <a id="l757"></a>before the Governour of Egypt, would have made a much greater <a id="l758"></a>noise in the Council of Tyre &amp; afterward, then the single <a id="l759"></a>Letter of Arsenius &amp; yet  Athanasius &amp; his friends at that time <a id="l762"></a>insisted only upon the evidence of this letter, representing  that Arsenius himself <a id="l764"></a>had shewed by his letter that he was alive &amp; intended no other <a id="l765"></a>evidence of his being alive &amp; complaining that  the Council of Tyre <a id="l766"></a>banished Athanasius notwithstanding that letter.  This was all that Athana<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>sius &amp;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l768"></a>his friends had then to allege,  as we <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>have<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l769"></a>shewed out of the letter of the Council of Alexandria.</p>
<p id="par39">And secondly I suspect the letter of Pinnes beca<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>use it repre<a id="l770"></a>sen<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ts  things contrary to what Athanasius <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> <a id="l771"></a>did in the letter of the Council of Alexandria.

<h2 id="hd10" class="cent">Quest 8 <a id="l904"></a><br>Whether the Letter of Ischyras was not feigned <a id="l905"></a>by Athanasius<br><br></h2>
<p id="par52">When Athanasius was accused of the above mentioned crimes <a id="l906"></a>by Ischyras,  he pretended that Ischyras became penitent <a id="l907"></a>&amp; wrote the following letter.</p>
<div>
<p id="par53">To the blessed Pope Athanasius, Ischyras wisheth  health in the Lord.</p>
<p id="par54">Seeing upon my coming to you, Lord Bishop, to be received <a id="l909"></a>into the Church, you chid me for what I had heretofore <a id="l910"></a>spoken as if I did that on my own accord, I have there<a id="l911"></a>fore sent you this Apology in writing that you might <a id="l912"></a>know that there was force done to me &amp; that I was beaten <a id="l913"></a>by Isaac &amp; Heraclides &amp; Isaac of Leotis &amp; by their com<a id="l914"></a>panions. But I calling God to witness upon this do say for <a id="l915"></a>my excuse that I am conscious of none of those things <a id="l916"></a>done by you of which they speak. ffor neither was there any <a id="l917"></a>cup broken nor holy Table overthrown, but all these <a id="l918"></a>calumnies they urged me to by force. These things I <a id="l919"></a>apologize for my self &amp; give you in writing, desiring to <a id="l920"></a>be one of your assembly. Farewell in the Lord. I have <a id="l921"></a>given this my hand to you  Bishop Athanasius in the presence <a id="l922"></a>of the Presbyters Ammon of Dicelle, Heraclius of Phasco <a id="l923"></a>Boccon of Chenebri, Achillas of Myrsene, Didymus of <a id="l924"></a>Taphosiris &amp; Iustus of Bomotheus: &amp; of the Deacons of <a id="l925"></a>Alexandria Paul, Peter &amp; Olympius &amp; these of Mare<a id="l926"></a>ote Ammonius, Pistus, Demetrius &amp; Gaius.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p id="par55">Now this letter I suspect because it looks as if <a id="l927"></a>contrived rather for the interest of  Athanasius than that of <a id="l928"></a> Ischyras,  &amp; seems more like a formal recantation or certificate then <a id="l929"></a>a free letter,  &amp; also conteins a ridiculous story. ffor who <a id="l930"></a>ever went about to procure false accusers or witnesses by forcing <a id="l931"></a>&amp; beating them? And were a fals accuser or witnesse so  procured, <a id="l932"></a>tis not likely that after his discovering the knavery, <a id="l933"></a>he would go on in accusing or witnessing, as Ischyras did to the end. <a id="l934"></a>Could a beating bout make Ischyras so hearty in the <a id="l935"></a>cause?  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022r"> &lt;22r&gt; </span> </p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; insertion from f 21v &gt; </span>
<p id="par56">And further if Ischyras went to Athanasius to be reconciled to him <a id="l944"></a>&amp; received into communion as this Letter represents, he went with <a id="l945"></a>designe either to confesse his fault or not. If to confesse, how came <a id="l946"></a>Athanasius to let him go without taking his confession before witnesses <a id="l947"></a>If not  to confesse how  could he hope to be <a id="l948"></a>pardoned &amp; received  by Athanasius? And afterwards if he sent <a id="l949"></a>this letter of confession how came Athanasius then to neglect <a id="l950"></a>sending for him &amp; making his advantage of the opportunity. Would <a id="l951"></a>Athanasius send up &amp; down the world to seek Arsenius &amp; not accept <a id="l952"></a>of Ischyras when he offered to come in, but content himself with a bare <a id="l953"></a>Letter? These things don't consist.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 22r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par57">But that which looks most odly is the witnessing of this <a id="l954"></a>letter.  For witnesses are never set to letters. <a id="l955"></a>They are set to no sorts of writings but such as are <a id="l956"></a>designed for evidence in legal proceedings &amp; therefore <a id="l957"></a>shew that the author of this letter designed it for <a id="l958"></a>evidence; that is  he designed by those witnesses to make it evidence for Athanasius against <a id="l959"></a>Ischyras. For there was no need of such evidence <a id="l960"></a>against any body else. Were these witnesses added to <a id="l961"></a>give credit to this Letter with Athanasius? There <a id="l962"></a>was no need of that. Were they added to give credit <a id="l963"></a>to it with others? Then the designe of it was not to <a id="l964"></a>make an interest with Athanasius for Ischyras but <a id="l965"></a>to make an interest with others for Athanasius against <a id="l966"></a>Ischyras. Had Ischyras been penitent &amp; desired to be <a id="l967"></a>reconciled to Athanasius  as this letter repre<a id="l968"></a>sents; he would not have sent a certificate to <a id="l969"></a>Athanasius against himselfe, but have wrote  an <a id="l970"></a> insinuating letter in general terms, &amp; have reserved <a id="l971"></a>himself to be useful to Athanasius as an evidence upon condition of <a id="l972"></a> pardon &amp; reconciliation: &amp; no doubt Athanasius would have <a id="l973"></a>accepted the condition with both hands.</p>

<p id="par59">There is another thing which looks very suspiciously. <a id="l974"></a>For many persons are named as witnesses, but their hands <a id="l975"></a>were not to the letter. <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>W<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ould  any man call his friends together to be witnesses to  a writing &amp; not make them set their hands to it? If Ischyras wrote this letter he either <a id="l976"></a>designed it for evidence or he did not. If he did not <a id="l977"></a>he would have made no mention of witnesses. If he did, <a id="l978"></a>he would certainly have caused them to set their hands  It looks therefore as written by somebody else <a id="l980"></a>who had a mind to give credit to it by witnesses, but <a id="l981"></a>knew not how either to procure or counterfeit their <a id="l982"></a>hands.</p>
<p id="par60">And the suspicion is much increased by considering <a id="l983"></a>that the truth of this letter was never proved (that I can <a id="l984"></a>find) by the actual testimony of any of the witnesses. The <a id="l985"></a>letter was written before the Council of Tyre &amp; by conse<a id="l986"></a>quence alleged in that Council &amp; in the Councils of Alexan<a id="l987"></a>dria Rome &amp; Sardica where Athanasius was present: but no <a id="l988"></a>witnesses that I can read of, were ever brought to prove it.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022v"> &lt;22v&gt; </span> I would ask therefore whether Athanasius &amp; his friends did try <a id="l989"></a>to get these letters proved in the Council of Tyre &amp; on other <a id="l990"></a>occasions or not: If they did not it argues a guilty conscience <a id="l991"></a>ffor without any examination of the businesse they took it for <a id="l992"></a>granted that the witnesses would be against them &amp; therefore <a id="l993"></a>did not beleive the reality of their testimony to the letters. <a id="l994"></a>But if they did try &amp; upon examining the witnesses found <a id="l995"></a>them against this letter, then is the letter false by the  concurrent testimony of  those very witnesses cited to <a id="l997"></a>prove them true. And this is to me a very great argument <a id="l998"></a>of suspicion. For the case is as if a man should produce a <a id="l999"></a>bond, wherein tis written that the party pretended to be bound  signed <a id="l1000"></a>it before such &amp; such witnesses but whose hands are not <a id="l1001"></a>to the bond, &amp; before a Iudge should produce none of the <a id="l1002"></a>witnesses but confesse that he never spake with them or that <a id="l1003"></a>they are all against him being the Defendants friends &amp; only <a id="l1004"></a>plead that they are good witnesses because   in the bond (pretend to be sent (sent  to the Plaintiff in a letter)  tis written that <a id="l1006"></a>the  Defendant signed it in their presence. So impudent a case as this <a id="l1007"></a>was scarce ever brought before a civil Magistrate, &amp; I cannot <a id="l1008"></a>find that it was allowed in the ecclesiastical  Courts of Atha<a id="l1009"></a>nasius's own party, except in the Council of Alexandria wherein <a id="l1010"></a>Athanasius himself presided. ffor tho the Councils of Rome &amp; <a id="l1011"></a>Sardica in their letters plead much against Ischyras, yet his <a id="l1012"></a> recantation (which was the main thing against him <a id="l1013"></a>if true) they do not say one word of, &amp; by consequence con<a id="l1014"></a>fided not in it.</p>

<p id="par61">When Athanasius being banished first by Constantine the great &amp; <a id="l1017"></a>then by his son Constantius appealed from the Council of Tyre <a id="l1018"></a>to the Pope, &amp; the Eastern Bishops were thereupon summoned <a id="l1019"></a>first to the Council of Rome &amp; then to the Council of Sar<a id="l1020"></a>dica to appear &amp; plead their cause but would not subject <a id="l1021"></a>themselves to the  authority of the Pope &amp; juris<a id="l1022"></a>diction of the western Bishops: Constans Emperor of the West <a id="l1023"></a> by the impulse of the Western Bishops wrote this letter to <a id="l1024"></a>his brother Constantius, threatning  that if he would <a id="l1025"></a>not  restore Athanasius &amp; animadvert upon his <a id="l1026"></a>adversaries he would come himself &amp; restore him by force. <a id="l1027"></a>Whereupon  Constantius being reduced to great straits called many of the Eastern Bish<a id="l1028"></a>ops together &amp; they advised him that it was better to let <a id="l1029"></a>Athanasius have his Church then undertake a civil war. <a id="l1030"></a>Constantius therefore invited Athanasius back by courteous <a id="l1031"></a>letters, &amp; a while after Vrsatius &amp; Valens two Bishops of Pannonia who <a id="l1032"></a>had  bin principal actors in the condemnation of Athanasius,  were said to have written  voluntarily two letters one from Aquileia to Athanasius  wherin they declare that they  desire his communion, the other at Rome to the Pope as follows.</p>

<h2 id="hd13" class="cent"> <a id="l1044"></a>To our Lord the blessed Pope Iulius, Valens <a id="l1045"></a>&amp; Vrsatius wisheth health.</h2>
<p id="par65"><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> </p>
<p id="par66">Since it is manifest that we formerly insinuated by our <a id="l1046"></a>letters many heinous things concerning Athanasius, &amp; being <a id="l1047"></a>convened by the letters of your holiness, could not give <a id="l1048"></a>an account of what we had signified: we confesse to your <a id="l1049"></a>Holinesse, in the presence of all the Presbyters our brethren,  that <a id="l1050"></a>all things which heretofore came to our ears concerning Athanasius <a id="l1051"></a>are false &amp; feigned &amp; of no force.

</div>
<div>
<p id="par67">This last Epistle is said by Hilary to have been written  upon <a id="l1061"></a>occasion of  a Council convening at Sirmium against Photinus two years <a id="l1062"></a>after the Council of Millain  &amp; by consequence four years after the Council of Sardica. ffor  Petavius &amp; Valesius   <a id="l1063"></a>agree with Socrates in placing this Council of Sirmium  in the year  351,  &amp; Liberius in his Epis<a id="l1064"></a>tle to Constantius written after George was made Bishop of Alexan<a id="l1065"></a>dria &amp; by consequence A.C. 356 or 357 reccons eight years from <a id="l1066"></a>the Council of Millain to the writing of that Epistle, &amp; therefore the <a id="l1067"></a>Council of Millain was celebrated A.C. 348 or 349 .</p>
<p id="par68">Now this  second Epistle of Vrsatius &amp; Valens I suspect for many reasons.</p>
<p id="par69">1. It is a confession attested by nameles witnesses &amp; was never proved.</p>
<p id="par70">2. The crime is too great &amp; shamefull for Bishops to acknowledge voluntarily as Valens &amp; Vrsatius are  here represented to have done.</p>
<p id="par71">3.  Eusebius who is mentioned in the  Epistle was dead before <a id="l1068"></a>&amp; if  with Hilary &amp; Sozomen to avoyd this objection you write Athanasius for Eusebius, the sense <a id="l1069"></a> is hard. For  Athanasius will be accused of an evil mind which is contrary to the designe of the <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span>  Epistle.</p>
<p id="par72">4. The  saying that Valens &amp; Vrsatius being required to <a id="l1070"></a>prove the  things charged ag<sup>t</sup> Ath. could not do it, is not con<a id="l1071"></a>sistent with the proceedings in the Council of Sardica. For there  five of the six Bishops then living who had been sent   from <a id="l1073"></a>the Council of Tyre to Mareote to examin the businesse of Ischy<a id="l1074"></a>ras,  (two of which five were Valens &amp; Vrsatius) propounded <a id="l1075"></a>to the Western Bishops that  an equal number of both parties should be sent again to <a id="l1076"></a>Mareote  to examin things anew &amp; if the  crime did not appear <a id="l1077"></a> , they five would be excommunicated, but if it did the like <a id="l1078"></a>number of the western Bishops who created the disturbance should be <a id="l1079"></a>excomunicated by the eastern. But the Western Bishops would not accept <a id="l1080"></a>of equal terms  The Eastern <a id="l1081"></a> must submit to the authority of the Pope &amp; jurisdiction of the western  or <a id="l1082"></a>go for criminals.</p>
<p id="par73">5. Pope Liberius <sup>a</sup> in his Letters to Constantius in behalf of Atha<a id="l1083"></a>nasius makes no mention of this   confession of Vrsatius &amp; Valens; <a id="l1084"></a>in this Epistle as he would surely have done had it been newly made to his predecessor.</p>
<p id="par74">6. The great Council of Ariminum <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup>  in their Letter to Constantius accused <a id="l1085"></a> Vrsatius &amp; Valens of  the first Confession  made <a id="l1086"></a>at Millan  saying that after they had been excommunicated upon suspicion of Arianism, they begged pardon &amp; were absolved at  the Council of Millan before  the legates of the Pope. But of the second Confession  &amp; absolution they make no mention, tho that would have been more material had it been true.</p>
<p id="par75">7. Vrsatius &amp; Valens were  excommunicated but once, that <a id="l1087"></a>is to say in the Council of Sardica; &amp; one  excommunication admits <a id="l1088"></a>but of one absolution. I</p>
<p id="par76">If you place the Council of Millan before the Council of Sar<a id="l1089"></a>dica the first  confession &amp; absolution will be before the western Bishops excommu<a id="l1090"></a>nicated any of the Eastern for Arianism, &amp; the 2<sup>d</sup> before Athanasius <a id="l1091"></a>went from Rome into the East both which are plainly absurd. ffor the <a id="l1092"></a>second confession was afterwards sent to Athanasius out of the west by Paulinus Bishop <a id="l1093"></a>of Treves.  And  further <a id="l1094"></a>the Council of Sardica  in their letters whereby they declare  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 24r resumes &gt; </span> Valens &amp; Vrsatius excommunicate for Arianism, would have taken notice <a id="l1095"></a>of their  former excommunication, recantation <a id="l1096"></a>&amp; absolution  had there been any such thing. But if you place  <a id="l1097"></a>the Council of Millan after the Council of Sardica as you ought to do then <a id="l1098"></a>Valens &amp; Vrsatius  will recant &amp; be absolved twice  from one excommunication: &amp; which increases the absurdi<a id="l1100"></a>ty, the Bishop of Rome alone will absolve them from what  <a id="l1101"></a>a Council (where he himself was present by his Legates) <a id="l1102"></a>had absolved them before. ffor their second recantation <a id="l1103"></a>plainly respects the proceedings of the Council of Sardica</p>
<p id="par77">So then there is no place for this second recanta<a id="l1104"></a>tion &amp; therefore I suspect  that after  <a id="l1105"></a>Constantius, to avoyd a civil war, recalled Athanasius, <a id="l1106"></a>Vrsatius &amp; Valens went  to Rome &amp; thence to  Millain to  satisfy <a id="l1108"></a>the Pope &amp; Council about their faith &amp; make their peace, <a id="l1109"></a> &amp; that  afterwards somebody took occasion from thence to feign a second confession <a id="l1110"></a>as if  those made at <a id="l1111"></a>Rome &amp; Millan had been different confessions &amp; the former <a id="l1112"></a>made two years after the latter.</p>

<h2 id="hd15" class="cent">Quest. 10 <a id="l1164"></a><br>Whether Athanasius was accused of adultery before <a id="l1165"></a>the Council of Tyre.</h2>
<p id="par86"> Philostorgius<sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup>  tells us that Athenasius being impelled by the Empe<a id="l1167"></a>rors threatning, came to Tyre, he  would not submit <a id="l1168"></a>to  stand in judgment, but  sent in a big bellied woman which he had hired to <a id="l1169"></a>accuse Eusebius of adultery, hoping that by the tumult  which would <a id="l1170"></a>probably be raised, he might escape being tried. But when Euse<a id="l1171"></a>bius asked her if she knew the man &amp; whether he was  amongst the Bishops then present, she answered that she was <a id="l1173"></a> not so senselesse as to accuse such men of base lust, &amp; <a id="l1174"></a>by those words discovered the fraud. This story the other <a id="l1175"></a>Historians Sozomen &amp; Theodoret<sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup>   invert as <a id="l1176"></a>if the whore was  hired by the Eusebians to accuse Athanasius &amp; the fraud <a id="l1177"></a>detected by one of Athanasius's friends to the confusion of his <a id="l1178"></a>accusers.  But this last story was <a id="l1181"></a>unknown to Athanasius &amp; his friends in the times next <a id="l1182"></a>after the Council of Tyre. For in the letters of the Councils <a id="l1183"></a>of Alexandria Rome &amp; Sardica they mention it not <a id="l1184"></a>though they omit nothing which made against that Council <a id="l1185"></a>&amp; this story had it been true would have  made more  against it then anything else they say. Nor does <a id="l1187"></a>Athanasius mention it in all his works. Whence I suspect <a id="l1188"></a>his friends sometime after the writing of his Apologies, <a id="l1189"></a>inverted the story of   the accusation</p>

<h2 id="hd17" class="cent">Quaest. 11 <a id="l1192"></a><br></h2>
<h2 id="hd18" class="left"><span class="large">Whether Athanasius did  sincerely acquit himself of the crime of <a id="l1197"></a>breaking the communion cup  of Ischyras.</span></h2>
<p id="par87" class="i0">When Athanasius succeeded in the Bishopric of Alexandria he <a id="l1198"></a>was accused of tyrannical behaviour towards the Meletians <a id="l1199"></a>so as  with his own hands to break <a id="l1200"></a>the communion cup of  Ischyras a Meletian Presbyter <a id="l1201"></a>in Mareote then performing sacred rites &amp; to subvert <a id="l1202"></a>the Altar &amp; cause the Church to be demolished. This <a id="l1203"></a>was the true accusation as I find by the letter of the 80 <a id="l1204"></a>eastern Bishops at Sardica recorded in Hilaries fragments.</p>
<p id="par88">On the other hand Athanasius &amp; his party represented <a id="l1205"></a>that Ischyras was no Priest, the place no Church, the <a id="l1206"></a>day not the Lords day; that Athanasius went not <a id="l1207"></a>thither himself but only sent Macarius who found <a id="l1208"></a>Ischyras not celebrating the sacrament but sick in bed <a id="l1209"></a>&amp; charged him not to proceed in those things, &amp; that Ischy<a id="l1210"></a>ras so soon as well fled to the Meletians &amp; Eusebians <a id="l1211"></a>who thereupon composed the accusation. But were this <a id="l1212"></a>representation genuine there could have been no colour <a id="l1213"></a>for framing an accusation. For cunning men never venture <a id="l1214"></a>to frame false accusations within some considerable colour <a id="l1215"></a>of circumstances handsomly laid together. The mystery <a id="l1216"></a>therefore I suspect to be this.</p>
<p id="par89"> I find by a letter of Constantine the great to <a id="l1217"></a>Athanasius that Athanasius &amp; Macarius were both of <a id="l1218"></a>them accused: &amp; by the letter which the 80 Eastern Bishops  wrote at Phippolis,  compared with some passa<a id="l1220"></a>ges cited by Pope Iulius out of the Acts of the Council <a id="l1221"></a>of Tyre, that when indeed Macarius was sent by Atha<a id="l1222"></a>nasius he found Ischyras sick in bed but that Atha<a id="l1223"></a>nasius was accused  for coming also him<a id="l1224"></a>self when Ischyras was administring the Eucharist &amp; for <a id="l1225"></a>breaking the communion cup &amp; overturing the altar with <a id="l1226"></a>his own hands. So then it seems (according to the accusation) <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027r"> &lt;27r&gt; </span> Macarius was sent first to forwarn Ischyras of executing <a id="l1227"></a>the office of a Presbyter &amp;  afterwards when he <a id="l1228"></a>would not desist Athanasius coming at a time proper <a id="l1229"></a>to find him in the act, overthrew the sacred things &amp; caused <a id="l1230"></a>the place to be demolished, Macarius perhaps assisting <a id="l1231"></a>him. Now the accusation lying only against this last act <a id="l1232"></a>Athanasius to acquit himself confounds this time with <a id="l1233"></a>the former &amp; undertakes to prove (not before the <a id="l1234"></a>Council of Tyre  where the accusation was understood, <a id="l1235"></a>but afterwards amongst the credulous western Bishops &amp; others of <a id="l1236"></a>his own party) that Macarius went alone within Atha<a id="l1237"></a>nasius &amp; found Ischyras sick in bed in a place which was <a id="l1238"></a>not  a Church, on a day which was not the Lords day, <a id="l1239"></a>&amp; only reproved him:  &amp; thence concludes that the <a id="l1240"></a>accusation that Athanasius found him on the Lords <a id="l1241"></a>day in a Church administring the Eucharist &amp;  <a id="l1242"></a>subverted the sacred things was a figment.  The Acts of the Council of Tyre being left at Rome by the Delegates of the Eastern Churches who fled thence in hast for their safty <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> some witnesses  declared that Macarius found Ischyras sick in bed Athanasius shews the Bishop of Rome  in these Acts   but conceales the evidence of  others <a id="l1250"></a>  (for the Acts were writ in Greek a language <a id="l1251"></a>not understood by the Latines) &amp; so perswades the Bishop <a id="l1252"></a>of Rome  that  Ischyras could not <a id="l1253"></a>be found in the Church administring the  Eucharist on the Lords day since  it <a id="l1254"></a>appeared by the very Acts of the Council that he <a id="l1255"></a>was found sick in bed. Now if Athanasius shuffled in making this  <a id="l1256"></a>Defense  then its plain <a id="l1257"></a>that he was gravelled &amp;  wanted a just defense. Which <a id="l1259"></a>is enough to decide the Question.</p>

Whereupon the rest of the Bishops <a id="l1298"></a>anathematized Athanasius, but he sending letters  in the name of the City to the Emperor procured a confirmation <a id="l1300"></a>of  his ordination &amp; thereby silenced his adversaries. <a id="l1301"></a>This was the accusation as tis represented by Sozomen <a id="l1302"></a>&amp; Philostorgius.<sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup>  And that there was some truth in <a id="l1303"></a>it is confest by Athanasius &amp; his Bishops in the con<a id="l1304"></a>cil of Alexandria collected about 15 years after <a id="l1305"></a>this ordination of Athanasius.

Thus you see while  this Council would seem to correct the accusation in point of <a id="l1321"></a>circumstances, they confess the sedition &amp; violence of <a id="l1322"></a>the people &amp; that the imprisoned Bishops  resisted them, many days <a id="l1323"></a>&amp; nights together before they would ordain him, &amp; that <a id="l1324"></a>all the people by whose violence this was done were no more in <a id="l1325"></a>number then one of the little churches built before the reign of Constantine <a id="l1326"></a>the great for the 12 parishes of Alexandria was able to hold.</p>
<p id="par92">Nor indeed was Athanasius capable of being ordained. <a id="l1327"></a>ffor he was but a Deacon, &amp; the Canon  constituted by Mark <a id="l1328"></a>the Evangelist &amp; constantly observed till that time, was <a id="l1329"></a>that there should be 12 Presbyters of that Church &amp; <a id="l1330"></a>that out of them the Bishop should be always elected.</p>
<p id="par93">And besides, he was scarce of age for such a dig<a id="l1331"></a>nity. ffor he was then but a youth scarce 25 years old. <a id="l1332"></a>Whence the <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n26-ref">[26]</sup>  Meletians used to cry: <em class="underline">O wickedness  He <a id="l1333"></a>a Bishop? or he a boy</em>?</p>
<p id="par94">To palliate these things the Athanasians have feigned as <a id="l1334"></a>if Alexander upon his death bed recommended Athanasius <a id="l1335"></a>for his successor &amp; Athanasius out of modesty then hid him<a id="l1336"></a>self. But this as it does not excuse the matter so it looks like a story of later date. ffor <a id="l1337"></a> the Council of Alexandria who omit nothing that made for Athanasius mention it not &amp; therefore knew nothing of it. <a id="l1338"></a> By comparing all circumstances its more to be <a id="l1339"></a>suspected that Athanasius in the controversy between the <a id="l1340"></a>Clergy of Alexander, inflamed differences, thereby to <a id="l1341"></a>throw out part of the Clergy &amp; make room for him<a id="l1342"></a>self &amp; his friends: &amp; when he had  thus gotten to be <a id="l1343"></a>Deacon, the reputation &amp; interest he had got with <a id="l1344"></a>his friends by that controversy, served him to invade <a id="l1345"></a>the Bishopric. ffor when the people  of his party, <a id="l1346"></a>shutting up themselves with certain of the Bishops in a <a id="l1347"></a>Church, importuned those Bishops for many days together <a id="l1348"></a>to ordain him, I do not hear that  he sided with <a id="l1349"></a>those Bishops against the people.</p>

<h2 id="hd20" class="cent">Quest. 13 <a id="l1350"></a><br>Whether Athanasius was not justly deposed <a id="l1351"></a>by the Council of Tyre.</h2>
<p id="par95">The arguments  for the justnesse of the <a id="l1352"></a>sentence are very great.</p>
<p id="par96">1. The Council of Tyre was a very full  one. So that if some B<sup>ps</sup> would have been partial there were others  <a id="l1354"></a>numerous enough to reduce em to modesty.  And if it be objected <a id="l1355"></a>that the Council was not free because the Emperor was present, there by his Deputy with  guards of soldiers: the objection lies stronger <a id="l1357"></a>against the Council of Nice where the Emperor was present <a id="l1358"></a>in person  &amp; that with a designe to influence the <a id="l1359"></a>decision of the Council, whereas at Tyre his Deputy was there <a id="l1360"></a>only to see peace kept.  The strange heats at Nice between <a id="l1361"></a>the Bishops   admonished the Emperor  to  prevent <a id="l1362"></a>the like at Tyre, &amp; if he had not done so there could have been <a id="l1363"></a>nothing but confusion, <img title="Symbol (breath-mark and small obelus) in text" src="/resources/images/texts/symbol.gif" alt="Symbol (breath-mark and small obelus) in text"> Athanasius bringing a great multitude out of Egypt to create disturbance &amp; behaving himself very tu<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>rbu<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>lently in his try<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>all <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n27-ref">[27]</sup><span class="nb-n">}</span></span>  as the <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>Coun<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>cil of Tyre <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>in their<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> circulatory letters comp<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>lained.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span></p>
<p id="par97">3. When  the Legates returned from Tyre &amp; Athanasius was fully heard &amp; <a id="l1364"></a>condemned he fled from Tyre &amp; appealed to the Emperor Constantine. <a id="l1365"></a>Whereat the Emperor by an angry letter summoned the Coun<a id="l1366"></a>cil to come &amp; give an account of their proceedings. But <a id="l1367"></a>they sent only six Legates.  And then the Emperor  heard all <a id="l1368"></a>the cause over again between Athanasius &amp; the Legates,  approved <a id="l1369"></a>the proceedings of the Council &amp; banished Athanasius. Tis true <a id="l1370"></a>that Athanasius represents that the  Legates feigned <a id="l1371"></a>a new  calumny against him whereby the Emperor <a id="l1372"></a>being incensed banished him in a passion within hearing the <a id="l1373"></a>case of Arsenius &amp; Ischyras: but the 80 Eastern Bishops <a id="l1374"></a>in the letter which  in their return from  Sardica they wrote <a id="l1375"></a>at Philippopolis say the contrary.  For <a id="l1376"></a>relating how  six Bishops  who were sent to Mareote returned to <a id="l1377"></a>Tyre &amp; confirmed the truth of the accusations, they add: <em class="underline">Vnde in <a id="l1378"></a>præsentem Athanasium dignam pro criminibus sententiam</em> [patres] <a id="l1379"></a><em class="underline">dicunt.

But he  pretended not to <a id="l1405"></a>have any witnesses: for he &amp; his friends never complained that <a id="l1406"></a>their witnesses were not examined. All their complaint was <a id="l1407"></a>that they were not admitted to except against the witnesses <a id="l1408"></a>of Ischyras,  as being   either heathens or <a id="l1409"></a>Catechumeni  or Arians, or <a id="l1410"></a>Meletians or Colluthians or persons suborned or any thing else than the friends of Athanasius. ffor <a id="l1411"></a>Athanasius &amp; his friends exclaim against  the Delegates for examining <a id="l1412"></a>all those sorts of people, as if heathens were not as good <a id="l1413"></a>witnesses in matters of fact as any  body else.

<p id="par99">4 ffive Years after was the Council of Alexandria of <a id="l1427"></a>80 B<sup>ps</sup> called by Athanasius against the Council of Tyre; but <a id="l1428"></a>whilst they examined not the cause between Athanasius &amp; <a id="l1429"></a> his accusers nor sent to Mareote to examin witnesses <a id="l1430"></a>but  but relied on the feigned letters of Arsenius &amp; Ischyras &amp; such other reports of  Athanasius &amp; his Presbyters being most <a id="l1431"></a>of them his creatures, &amp; whilst  Athanasius  himself <a id="l1432"></a>(  the party accused &amp; condemned)) presided in the Council &amp; most probably  <a id="l1433"></a>penned their Letter: what they did can amount to nothing  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030r"> &lt;30r&gt; </span> more then prejudice. Neither did the Councils of Rome &amp;  Sardica examin the  cause between Athanasius &amp; his accu<a id="l1435"></a>sers or send to Mareote to inform themselves, but relied upon <a id="l1436"></a>the  credit of the Council of Alexandria  &amp; that of the Presbyters of Athanasius, &amp; were also influenced by <a id="l1439"></a>ambition, their designe being to make the Pope universal Bishop <a id="l1440"></a>&amp; under him to exercise jurisdiction over the eastern Churches. <a id="l1441"></a> For  the Pope summoned them to the Council of Rome <a id="l1442"></a> to be judged &amp; when <a id="l1443"></a>they  checkt him for his ambition &amp; refused to  come &amp; subject <a id="l1444"></a>themselves the  Council of Rome absolved Athanasius without any <a id="l1445"></a>judicial processe, as if the eastern Bishops by not coming to <a id="l1446"></a>plead had acknowledged themselves guilty.  Afterwards the Council of <a id="l1447"></a>Sardica proceeded upon the same ground, excommunicating the <a id="l1448"></a>Chief of the eastern Bishops because they would not come  to submit themselves, &amp; making a decree that appeals <a id="l1450"></a>might be made from all the world to the Pope. This intermixing <a id="l1451"></a>of the  concern for the universal Bishoprick <a id="l1452"></a>puts a prejudice upon the  proceedings for Athanasius <a id="l1453"></a>&amp; makes them irregular &amp; void. And  the prejudice is increased <a id="l1454"></a>by the case of Marcellus who was deposed  by the eastern <a id="l1455"></a>B<sup>ps</sup> for heresy &amp; absolved  &amp; justified by the <a id="l1456"></a>Councils of Rome &amp;  Sardica &amp; yet afterwards <a id="l1457"></a>acknowledged by all the world to be guilty of the heresy for <a id="l1458"></a>which he was deposed. Now if the Councils of Alexandria <a id="l1459"></a>Rome &amp; Sardica neither acted judicially nor without prejudice then <a id="l1460"></a>has there been nothing done to dissolve the judgment of the Council of Tyre &amp; there<a id="l1461"></a>fore that Council is still in force.</p>
<p id="par100">5. The  proceedings against  Athanasius are further  cleared by a proposal made  <a id="l1463"></a>at the  Council of Sardica,  <a id="l1465"></a>by five of the six Bishops which were sent from Tyre to Mareote, <a id="l1466"></a>namely that an equal number of Bishops should be sent  by both parties to the places where Athanasius had committed his crimes to examin things anew &amp; if the <a id="l1468"></a> report <a id="l1469"></a>which those five made to the Council of Tyre appeared to be false <a id="l1470"></a>they would stand excommunicated within complaining to any <a id="l1471"></a>body, but if  it  were found true, then five of those who <a id="l1472"></a>abetted  Athanasius should be excommunicated &amp; complain <a id="l1473"></a>to no body. But this equal condition the friends of Athanasius  <a id="l1474"></a>durst not accept of.</p>

<h2 id="hd21" class="cent">Quest. 14 <a id="l1576"></a><br>Whether Athanasius was not seditious.</h2>
<p id="par106"><sup class="note" id="n47-ref">[47]</sup> The Council of Tyre in their circulatory letter wherin they <a id="l1577"></a>declared his condemnation; charged him with turbulent behavi<a id="l1578"></a>or in the Council.</p>
<p id="par107"><sup class="note" id="n48-ref">[48]</sup> Constantine the great when Antony moved in his behalf <a id="l1579"></a>replied that he was  petulant arrogant &amp; the author of discord &amp; sedition.</p>
<p id="par108">The Council of Philippolis represented (as you may see at large in their letter) to the Churches) that after his return from <a id="l1580"></a>Gallia he was more turbulent  &amp; tyrannical then <a id="l1581"></a>before, creating &amp; setting up Bishops against Bishops  in the Eastern Churches <a id="l1582"></a>where he had no authority to intermeddle,  &amp; being as exorbitant in Egypt.</p>
<p id="par109">When he was ready to be banished by the  Emperor a second time, he <a id="l1584"></a>called the Council of Alexandria &amp;  together with them wrote a letter to <a id="l1586"></a>all the world, in the end of which they laboured to put  all their friends into a tumult against the eastern <a id="l1588"></a>Churches &amp; by consequence against their Emperor. For after <a id="l1589"></a> a long complaint against against the Eastern Churches <a id="l1590"></a>they thus conclude with an exhortation to invade &amp; destroy  them by open force &amp; violence. <em class="underline">Therefore  (say they) how these things are not <a id="l1591"></a>to go unrevenged,  even you beloved may see. <a id="l1592"></a>For they are grievous &amp; remote from the doctrine of Christ. <a id="l1593"></a> ffor this cause therefore we being assembled <a id="l1594"></a>together have written in common to you praying your pru<a id="l1595"></a>dence in Christ to receive this our contestation &amp; to grieve <a id="l1596"></a>together with our fellow Bishop Athanasius, &amp; to conceive in<a id="l1597"></a>dignation against the Eusebians who endeavour these things <a id="l1598"></a>that wickednesse &amp; malice may not prevail against the <a id="l1599"></a>Church. ffor we pray &amp; implore you to be revengers of <a id="l1600"></a>this injustice, citing the saying of the Apostle,  Put away <a id="l1601"></a>from amongst your selves that wicked person.<sup class="note" id="n49-ref">[49]</sup>  For the <a id="l1602"></a>things which they do are wicked &amp; not worthy of commu<a id="l1603"></a>nion.

<p id="par110">A while after when their Emperor sent an armed <a id="l1610"></a>force to displace Athanasius &amp; place Gregory in his room, <a id="l1611"></a>(for Athanasius  &amp; his party would never  yeild to any thing but <a id="l1612"></a>force)  he shut himself up in a church with a mul<a id="l1613"></a>titude against the soldiers &amp; when they could defend the <a id="l1614"></a>Church no longer left it on fire:  of which action  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p032v"> &lt;32v&gt; </span> Council of Philippolis make this mention <em class="underline">Constituto jam in  Athanasij locum, <a id="l1615"></a>ex judicio Concilij sancto et integro  sacerdote, ut barba<a id="l1616"></a>rus hostis ut pestis sacrilega adductis gentilium populis Dei templu<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>m<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l1617"></a>incendit, altare commisuit, et clam exit de civitate occultéque <a id="l1618"></a>profugit</em>.

<p id="par112"><em class="underline"> The things we have suffered are grievous &amp; intollera<a id="l1626"></a>ble &amp; cannot be sufficiently declared: but yet that I <a id="l1627"></a>may in brief expresse their grievousness,  its proper to  remind you of a history out of sacred writ. A Levite <a id="l1629"></a>being injured in his wife &amp; reflecting upon the greatnesse of the <a id="l1630"></a>indignity . . . . . . . sent her body cut in pieces to all the tribes <a id="l1631"></a>of Israel, that  they might look upon this common injury as done not only <a id="l1632"></a>to him but to  them  all,  &amp; that either if <a id="l1633"></a> they compassionated his case  they might revenge it or else if <a id="l1634"></a>they neglected  the wickednesse they might be ashamed. Now The messengers told  <a id="l1635"></a>the fact, &amp; they that heard &amp; saw it said there was never <a id="l1636"></a>any such thing done since Israel came out of Egypt. There<a id="l1637"></a>fore all the tribes were moved, &amp;  all of them as if each had suffered <a id="l1638"></a>were gathered together. In conclusion they that had committed <a id="l1639"></a>this wickednesse were invaded &amp; conquered &amp; made an anathema <a id="l1640"></a>by all.  For they that came together  respected not <a id="l1641"></a>the kindred of the transgressors but the wickednesse.

<p id="par113">And this is enough to let you see the spirit of that <a id="l1678"></a>man  ffor this shews plainly how for the sake of a Bishoprick he <a id="l1679"></a>laboured to set the whole Roman world on flame, to make a <a id="l1680"></a>shism between the eastern &amp; western churches &amp; to  <a id="l1681"></a>raise a civil war against his own Emperor. ffor this <a id="l1682"></a>end therefore he fled from Alexandria to Rome &amp; <a id="l1683"></a>ceased not to incense the western Bishops  till by their <a id="l1684"></a>interest  with the western Emperor Constans, he procured <a id="l1685"></a>a Council to be called at Sardica wherein 'twas designed that <a id="l1686"></a>the eastern Bishops should stand at the barr as criminals &amp; <a id="l1687"></a>be judged by the western.

But he that could feign other men's letters, could <a id="l1704"></a>deny his own. In this apology he  <a id="l1705"></a>answers three objections, the 1<sup>st</sup> that he had stirred up  the <a id="l1706"></a>western Emperor Constans against  his own Emperor <a id="l1707"></a>Constantius, the 2<sup>d</sup> that he had endeavoured also by that letter <a id="l1708"></a>to stirr up Magnentius against him &amp; the 3<sup>d</sup> that he <a id="l1709"></a>did not  afterwards come into the west when the <a id="l1710"></a>Emperor sent for him: To the first he answers that he <a id="l1711"></a>did not stir up Constantius, to the second that he did not <a id="l1712"></a>write that Letter &amp; to the 3<sup>d</sup> that he did not know <a id="l1713"></a>it was the Emperors will that he should come into the <a id="l1714"></a>west,  the first of the three messengers which <a id="l1715"></a>were sent for him delivering  (as he represents) a lying letter from the Em<a id="l1716"></a>peror, the  next delivering none  at all. If you can <a id="l1717"></a>beleive that he answered sincerely to the first &amp; third ob<a id="l1718"></a>jection you may beleive he did so to the second. For my <a id="l1719"></a>part I rather think that he who wrote two public circulatory <a id="l1720"></a>letters to stirr up the  Western Empire against the Eastern <a id="l1721"></a>did endeavour to stir it up, &amp; he that refused to obey Constantine the <a id="l1722"></a>great was also refractory to Constantius, as Sozomen tells us he <a id="l1723"></a>was.<sup class="note" id="n51-ref">[51]</sup>  ffor  to me  it seems incredible that Constantius should assemble two Councils to hear his cause send for him by <a id="l1724"></a> first by a messenger with a letter &amp; then by two other messengers successively with armed forces, &amp; yet he not understand all this while that he was sent for. The bringing the Roman Legions against him the third time to take him by force shews that he did not only know he was sent for, but made some resistance the  second time &amp; therefore I take the relation of Sozomen to be true, which was as follows.<sup class="note" id="n52-ref">[52]</sup> </p>

<p id="par120">In short the  Egyptians were so seditious that afterwards <a id="l1855"></a>when Valens would have expell'd Athanasius he  could <a id="l1856"></a>not  effect it but  found it necessary to desist.

<p id="par121">What sort of martyrs &amp; confessors those were which Atha<a id="l1890"></a>nasius so much celebrates in his works you have already <a id="l1891"></a>heard, &amp; may further understand by  what Athanasius <a id="l1892"></a>says of them in his epistle to the Moncks; where speaking <a id="l1893"></a>first of the bishops which were banished before the above <a id="l1894"></a>mentioned skirmish in the wildernesse &amp; then of the Bishops <a id="l1895"></a>of all Egypt Libya &amp; Pentapolis which in that skirmish <a id="l1896"></a>were partly put to flight &amp; partly taken prisoners &amp; <a id="l1897"></a> banished as many of them  as would not submit, he saith.<sup class="note" id="n56-ref">[56]</sup>  <em class="underline">Be <a id="l1898"></a>it that against Athanasius &amp; the other Bishops which they have <a id="l1899"></a>banished they could feign false pretences of crimes, yet <a id="l1900"></a>those things are nothing to this new kind of evil. ffor <a id="l1901"></a>what crime could they feign against all Egypt Libya &amp; <a id="l1902"></a>Pentapolis? ffor they have not attempted them severally <a id="l1903"></a>that they might be able to feign fals accusations but have <a id="l1904"></a>set upon all together, so that if they should feign any thing <a id="l1905"></a>they should presently be condemned for lyars</em>. To the same <a id="l1906"></a>purpose Athanasius has another passage in this Epistle. <sup class="note" id="n57-ref">[57]</sup> <em class="underline">Be it</em>, <a id="l1907"></a>saith he, <em class="underline">that they have made Athanasius a criminal yet <a id="l1908"></a>what have the other Bishops done?

<p id="par122">Now by the Egyptian martyrs &amp; confessors you may <a id="l1922"></a>know what those were in other places of all which <a id="l1923"></a>Lucifer Calaritanus gives you the following account <a id="l1924"></a>where speaking to Constantius he saith: <sup class="note" id="n58-ref">[58]</sup>  <em class="underline">Mactasti quamplu<a id="l1925"></a>rimos in Alexandria, laniasti certos toto in orbe, disperdisti</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p035r"> &lt;35r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">resistentes tibi varijs in locis. sed hi omnes quod tu audire <a id="l1926"></a>minimè vis, martyres sunt: illos omnes beatissimos tuo mac<a id="l1927"></a>tatos gladio in paradiso esse  credimus</em>. Thus you see the <a id="l1928"></a>martyrs  of the Athanasians for which <a id="l1929"></a>Constantius is in history recorded  a persecutor, were <a id="l1930"></a>such as perished by the sword in resisting the higher <a id="l1931"></a>powers.</p>
<p id="par123">To these you may add the six or seven  Bishops who <a id="l1932"></a>were banished for not subscribing the Condemnation of Athana<a id="l1933"></a>sius. For they were  deposed by Councils of their own <a id="l1934"></a>religion, &amp; therefore suffered not for their faith. They <a id="l1935"></a>endeavoured to keep up a schism between the eastern &amp; western <a id="l1936"></a>churches, &amp; so were  banished as enemies to  peace. . They refused to debate upon those <a id="l1937"></a>matters for which the Emperor called the Councils  unless they <a id="l1938"></a>might have their own matters first dispatcht &amp; so suffered <a id="l1939"></a>as politicians for usurping upon the Emperors right. They <a id="l1940"></a>profered to comply if the Nicene Creed were first ratified <a id="l1941"></a>&amp; so acknowledged it lawfull to comply &amp; by consequence were <a id="l1942"></a>banished for resisting the higher powers where it was their <a id="l1943"></a>duty to obey. </p>
<p id="par124">So soon as the Councils of Ariminum &amp; Seleucia were <a id="l1947"></a>over Athanasius &amp; his friends falling into a rage at <a id="l1948"></a>the Emperors successe began to write railing books against <a id="l1949"></a>him, &amp; Athanasius indeed labours to perswade his Egyp<a id="l1950"></a>tians that the Emperor overcame the western Bishops by <a id="l1951"></a>tyrannical  asperity &amp; terror, &amp; yet the contrary is <a id="l1952"></a>certainly true.

<p id="par125">How far this Emperor was from being a Persecutor  <a id="l2018"></a>is further manifested by a story told of him by Gregory Nazi<a id="l2019"></a>anzen,<sup class="note" id="n61-ref">[61]</sup>   which  in the words of his Interpreter <a id="l2020"></a>is as follows.</p>

<p id="par126">The same Gregory Nazianzen also in his 1<sup>st</sup> Oration <a id="l2021"></a>against Iulian thus expostulates with the soul of the deceased Constantius for making <a id="l2022"></a>Iulian Emperor. Quid tibi accidit, Ô Imperatorum divinissime <a id="l2023"></a>Christique amantissime (eo: enim provehor ut tecum velut cum <a id="l2024"></a>præsente atque audiente expostulem, etsi multò præstantiorem te <a id="l2025"></a>esse scio quam ut a me reprehendi debeas, utpote qui Deo <a id="l2026"></a>adjunctus sis, cælestisque gloriæ hæreditatem acceperis atque in tantum <a id="l2027"></a>a nobis migraris ut imperium cum meliore commutares,) <a id="l2028"></a>quodnam hoc consilium suscepisti qui omnes non tuæ solum sed <a id="l2029"></a>etiam superioris memoriæ Imperatores animi solertia  et <a id="l2030"></a>acumine longe antecellebas?

Thus far <a id="l2057"></a>Gregory: which testimony coming freely from the mouth of an enemy <a id="l2058"></a>&amp; an eye-witnesse of things is as great as can be desired. So <a id="l2059"></a>Libanius a heathen &amp; therefore another enemy, gives him the same character. ffor in his Oration called Basiliscus, after he had described <a id="l2060"></a>the behaviour of Constantius in war, he goes on thus: <em class="underline">Verum cùm <a id="l2061"></a>adeo illustris esset in armis, longe præstantior alijs in rebus, qum <a id="l2062"></a>in bellicis fuit: ut de eo enunciare liceat, Rex probus hic, bellator <a id="l2063"></a>et acer. Non enim eò se tum meliorem quam alij visum iri <a id="l2064"></a>autumabat  cum magis quam cæteri sæviret, sed si magis qum <a id="l2065"></a>alij clementia gavisus, omnes nihilo secius superaret</em> &amp;c. In short the <a id="l2066"></a>vertues of this  Emperor were so illustrius that I do not find a better <a id="l2067"></a>character given of any   Prince for clemency, temperance, chastity, <a id="l2068"></a>contempt of popular fame,  affection to Christianity, justice, prudence, princely carriage  &amp; good government then <a id="l2069"></a>is given of him  by his very enemies.  He kept up the imperial dignity of his person to the height &amp; yet reigned in the hearts of his people &amp; swayd the world by ther love: So far <a id="l2070"></a>was he from deserving the name of a persecutor.  Ammianus  indeed objects that he took off his Vnkles, &amp; prosecuted <a id="l2072"></a>his victory over Magnentius too far: but  he did the first because <a id="l2073"></a>they poisoned his father &amp; the last to secure not himself but Christianity from <a id="l2074"></a>the  attempts of the heathens. And these objections being removed <a id="l2075"></a>the character  which Ammianus gives of him is great &amp; agrees with that <a id="l2076"></a>of Hilary Libanius &amp; Nazianzen. And if these witnesses suffice not let me <a id="l2077"></a>add a fift. ffor <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n62-ref">[62]</sup>  Epiphanius saith that he was mercifull &amp; good &amp; pious in all <a id="l2078"></a>respects,  as the Son of the great &amp; perfect &amp; pious Constantine <a id="l2079"></a>this only thing excepted that by the influence of his Bishops he erred in the faith.

<h2 id="hd26" class="cent"> Quest. <a id="l2083"></a><br>Whether Athanasius &amp; his friends did not corrupt  the records <a id="l2084"></a>of the Councils of Nice &amp; Sardica.</h2>
<p id="par127">For making you understand the reason of this question I shall first explain what were the true records of these Councils.</p>
<p id="par128">The Council of Sardica in their Epistle to Pope Iulius <a id="l2085"></a>write that, <em class="underline">Three things were to be treated of by them <a id="l2086"></a>For</em>, say they, <em class="underline">the most religious Emperors permitted that <a id="l2087"></a>all things discussed should be wholy disputed afresh &amp; chiefly <a id="l2088"></a>concerning the holy faith, &amp; concerning the integrity of <a id="l2089"></a>the truth which they</em> (the Eusebians) <em class="underline">had violated, seond<a id="l2090"></a>ly concerning the persons which they said were dejected <a id="l2091"></a>by unjust judgment that if they could prove it righteous <a id="l2092"></a>there might be a just confirmation thereof. And the <a id="l2093"></a>third question was that they had done grievous injuries <a id="l2094"></a>to the Church in disturbing Bishops Presbyters &amp; Deacons <a id="l2095"></a>&amp; Banishing all the clergy</em>. What they had done in the two last the <a id="l2096"></a>Council explains in the following part of the Epistle <a id="l2097"></a>shewing how the ringleaders of the Eusebians were <a id="l2098"></a>excommunicated by them for unjust judgment &amp; those <a id="l2099"></a>retained in communion whom by such judgment they <a id="l2100"></a>had opprest: but of the first there is not a word <a id="l2101"></a>now extant in the Epistle. No doubt they gave the <a id="l2102"></a>Pope an account of what they did in the first as well <a id="l2103"></a>as of what they did in the other two because they say it <a id="l2104"></a>was the chief &amp; mention it with designe to tell him what <a id="l2105"></a>they had done therein. And therefore this letter has been <a id="l2106"></a>purged.</p>
<p id="par129">And that it has, is evident from Sozomen who thus <a id="l2107"></a>supplies the defect:<sup class="note" id="n63-ref">[63]</sup>  <em class="underline">They</em>, saith he [at Sardica] <em class="underline">published <a id="l2108"></a>another profession of faith more prolix than the Nicene <a id="l2109"></a>yet containing the same opinion &amp; not much differing <a id="l2110"></a>from it in words. And Hosius &amp; Protogenes who were <a id="l2111"></a>then chief among the Bishops of the west convened <a id="l2112"></a>at Sardica wrote letters to Iulius &amp; testified that they <a id="l2113"></a>had ratified the Nicene Decrees &amp; for more perspicu<a id="l2114"></a>ities sake had expounded the same opinion more largely <a id="l2115"></a>least the Arians abusing the briefnesse of that Creed <a id="l2116"></a>should take occasion to draw into an absurd sense <a id="l2117"></a>those that were unskilfull in such kind of disputes</em>.</p>
<p id="par130">So then the Council of Sardica did certainly write <a id="l2118"></a>an exposition of faith. ffor to this exposition  Hilary  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p038v"> &lt;38v&gt; </span> in his book against Constantius alludes to in these words <a id="l2119"></a><em class="underline">Thou condemnest also</em>, saith he to the Emperor, <em class="underline">the name <a id="l2120"></a>of Substance whereby thou didst to the western churches <a id="l2121"></a>falsly pretend thy self pious both to the Synod of Sar<a id="l2122"></a>dica &amp; to that of Sirmium</em>: that is to that of the western <a id="l2123"></a>bishops  met at Sirmium a year or two after the <a id="l2124"></a>Council of Sardica. And so Soebadius, when Hosius in the <a id="l2125"></a>next Council of Sirmium had newly subscribed against <a id="l2126"></a>the homousios wrote thus concerning him. <em class="underline">His authority</em>, <a id="l2127"></a>saith he, <em class="underline">is no prescription because he either errs now <a id="l2128"></a>or always did erre. ffor the world knows what he has <a id="l2129"></a>beleived hitherto. &amp; with what constancy he assented <a id="l2130"></a>&amp; condemned the Arians at Sardica &amp; in the Nicene <a id="l2131"></a>decree. What if he now thinks otherwise &amp; those things <a id="l2132"></a>are now defended which he heretofore condemned &amp; those <a id="l2133"></a>condemned which he defended</em>? And of the same Creed <a id="l2134"></a>speaks the fourth General Council (that of Chalcedon) <a id="l2135"></a>in their epistle to the Emperor Marcian, where enu<a id="l2136"></a>merating several confessions of faith which had been <a id="l2137"></a>formerly made, viz<sup>t</sup> the Nicene, the Constantinopolitan <a id="l2138"></a>the Ephesine, that of S. Basil &amp; that of Damasus in <a id="l2139"></a>a Roman Synod) amongst the rest mention the Sardican. <a id="l2140"></a><sup class="note" id="n64-ref">[64]</sup>  <em class="underline">Those also</em>, say they, <em class="underline">who at Sardica strove against the <a id="l2141"></a>reliques of Arius sent their sentence to the Orientals, <a id="l2142"></a>….. Hosius presiding in composing it</em>. And to put the questi<a id="l2143"></a>on yet further out of doubt, Theodoret<sup class="note" id="n65-ref">[65]</sup>  has recorded <a id="l2144"></a>the letter of the Council of Sardica to the Churches; in the <a id="l2145"></a>latter end of which this sentence or confession of faith is <a id="l2146"></a>conteined.  But Athanasius for reconciling the Council of Nice &amp; Sardica &amp; stifling an objection against himself hath  cut off all the latter part of this letter &amp; denies that the Council of Sardica wrote any definition of faith.</p>
<p id="par131"> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p039r"> &lt;39r&gt; </span>  But to make the point a little clearer <a id="l2173"></a>it will be convenient to explain why he did so.</p>
<p id="par132">The Council of Nice in decreing the Son homousios to <a id="l2174"></a>the ffather understood that he &amp; the father were two <a id="l2175"></a>substances of one nature or essence as Curcellæus &amp; <a id="l2176"></a>Cudworth have proved beyond all cavils. But the word <a id="l2177"></a>being ambiguous &amp; going abroad without those limits which <a id="l2178"></a>the Council had put to its signification, every one drew it <a id="l2179"></a>to his own sense, &amp; particularly in the West some great <a id="l2180"></a>ones to propagate a notion of a singular substance wrote <a id="l2181"></a><em class="underline">unius substantiæ</em> in the Latin translation of the Creed, &amp;  <a id="l2182"></a> in turning this language again into <a id="l2183"></a>Greek affirmed that there was but one hypostasis of the <a id="l2184"></a>ffather son &amp; Holy Ghost, as you may see in the letter <a id="l2185"></a>of the Council of Sardica</p>
<p id="par133">The Greeks therefore finding the Nicene decree <a id="l2186"></a>misinterpreted &amp; abused by many for spreading the <a id="l2187"></a>opinions of Montanus, Praxeas, Noetius, Paul of Samosat <a id="l2188"></a>Sabellius &amp; such like Gnosticks (for 'twas the opinion of <a id="l2189"></a>Simon Magus the Father of the Gnosticks) repented of <a id="l2190"></a>their having decreed the word &amp; began to forbear the <a id="l2191"></a>use of it. And hence arose a difference between the Greeks <a id="l2192"></a>&amp; Latines, the Greeks suspecting the Latines of Sabelli<a id="l2193"></a>anism for holding one singular hypostasis or substance &amp; the Latines <a id="l2194"></a>suspecting the Greeks of Arianism for holding three hy<a id="l2195"></a>postases. The Greeks therefore to clear themselves from <a id="l2196"></a>the suspicion of Arianism anathematized the doctrine of  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p039v"> &lt;39v&gt; </span> Arius in several Creeds which they then made, all which are <a id="l2197"></a>very orthodox as they that peruse them must acknowledge. <a id="l2198"></a>But without the word homousios nothing would satis<a id="l2199"></a>fy the Latines. And therefore in the Council of Sardi<a id="l2200"></a>ca they condemned the  Greeks as hereticks for <a id="l2201"></a>holding three hypostases divided from one another,  that <a id="l2202"></a>is (as we expresse it) three distinct Hypostases &amp; in opposi<a id="l2203"></a>tion thereunto decreed that there  was but one <a id="l2204"></a>Hypostasis of the Father Son &amp; Holy Ghost. And on the <a id="l2205"></a>other hand the Greeks of the same Council anathema<a id="l2206"></a>tized those that held the Son to be the Father Son &amp; Holy Ghost <a id="l2207"></a>, reflecting thereby upon the una hyposta<a id="l2208"></a>sis of the Latines as the doctrine of Sabellius whereby all three persons were made one thing. And so <a id="l2209"></a>the businesse came to a schism.</p>
<p id="par134">By this means the errors of the Gnosticks <a id="l2210"></a> still got ground in the west till they came <a id="l2211"></a>to such a height as Hilary in his book de Synodis <a id="l2212"></a>(written to the Bishops of Gallia &amp; Brittain in the <a id="l2213"></a>times between the Councils of Sirmium &amp; Ari<a id="l2214"></a>minum) describes. For there he tells them of a thre<a id="l2215"></a>fold opinion of that kind  spread among them by the fallacious  lan<a id="l2216"></a>guage of <em class="underline">una substantia</em>, the one of the Son's <a id="l2217"></a>substance being entirely the substance of the ffather, <a id="l2218"></a>the other of its being from eternity a part thereof, the third of the <a id="l2219"></a>substance of the Deity being one at first &amp; then divided <a id="l2220"></a>into two. <em class="underline">It remains</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">that without asking you <a id="l2221"></a>know what things lead you into error out of  <a id="l2222"></a>security of simplicity</em>, that is out of security arising from <a id="l2223"></a> simplicity in taking the  phrase una substantia in its most <a id="l2224"></a>obvious but erroneous significations. And  then going <a id="l2225"></a>on to explain this, he adds. <em class="underline">Many of us, most dear <a id="l2226"></a>brethren do so preach one substance of the father &amp; the <a id="l2227"></a>son that they seem to preach it not so much piously <a id="l2228"></a>as impiously. ffor this word has in it both a conscience <a id="l2229"></a>of faith &amp; a delusion in readiness. ffor if we preach <a id="l2230"></a>one substance according to the property &amp; similitude <a id="l2231"></a>of nature, so that the similitude may not define the</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p040r"> &lt;40r&gt; </span><em class="underline">species</em> [that is limit it to a singularity]<em class="underline"> but signify the genus, we preach it religiously <a id="l2232"></a>provided that by one substance we understand the <a id="l2233"></a>similitude of property so that their being one do <a id="l2234"></a>not signify a singular [substance] but two equals. By equality I <a id="l2235"></a>mean a similitude without a difference so that simi<a id="l2236"></a>litude be recconed equality. And equality is therefore <a id="l2237"></a>called one because tis eaven, I meane one in which equal <a id="l2238"></a>or eaven is signified &amp; not which is taken for one alone <a id="l2239"></a>Therefore one substance, if it do not take away one of <a id="l2240"></a>the subsisting persons nor divide one [former] substance into two will <a id="l2241"></a>be preacht religiously. But if we so call the Father <a id="l2242"></a>&amp; son of one substance that he who subsists altho he <a id="l2243"></a>have two names be notwithstanding one &amp; alone; whilst <a id="l2244"></a>we confesse the Son in name we do not retain him in <a id="l2245"></a>conscience if confessing one substance we esteem him <a id="l2246"></a>with himself one [substance] alone &amp; singular both the Father &amp; <a id="l2247"></a>the Son</em>. This is the first erroneous sense  <a id="l2249"></a>namely singularity of substance, which according to his descripti<a id="l2250"></a>on is Sabellianism. And of this, you see, he saith many <a id="l2251"></a>of the western Bishops were guilty. The other <a id="l2252"></a>two erroneous senses he thus describes. <em class="underline">There is also</em>, <a id="l2253"></a>saith he,  <em class="underline">from that word occasion given <a id="l2254"></a>of this great error that the father be understood divided <a id="l2255"></a>from himself &amp; to have cut out a part of himself <a id="l2256"></a>which should be the son. For so hereticks contend in <a id="l2257"></a>preaching one substance &amp; the language of our pious <a id="l2258"></a>confession seems much to favour these men so that <a id="l2259"></a>whilst this word</em> [one substance] <em class="underline">by reason of an indefinite <a id="l2260"></a>brevity is dubious it leads to error. There is also a <a id="l2261"></a>third error in that when the ffather &amp; Son are said <a id="l2262"></a>to be of one substance there may seem to be a former <a id="l2263"></a>substance which the two equals may have between <a id="l2264"></a>them : as if the speech signified three things one <a id="l2265"></a>substance &amp; two coheirs (as it were) of that substance</em>. <a id="l2266"></a>And then repeating the errors he subjoyns. <em class="underline">And so one <a id="l2267"></a>substance affirmed of the ffather &amp; Son does either <a id="l2268"></a>signify one thing with two names or one substance by <a id="l2269"></a>division made two imperfect ones or a third former <a id="l2270"></a>substance affirmed of two which is therefore called one be-</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p041r"> &lt;41r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">cause one is divided into two</em>. Thus far Hilary concerning the <a id="l2271"></a>three western errors arising from the Nicene Creed, the first of which <a id="l2272"></a>was that of Hermogenes, Praxeas, Noetius,  Sabellius, <a id="l2273"></a>&amp; Simon Magus who made himself all three persons;  the <a id="l2274"></a>second &amp; third those of Montanus, Tertullian,  Donatus, Paul of Samosat, Hierax &amp; the Ma<a id="l2275"></a>nichees  <sup>✝</sup> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 40v &gt; </span><sup>✝</sup> the Maniches &amp;  all such Gnosticks &amp; others as derived the Son from the Father <a id="l2276"></a>by any division, eruption, efflux,  projection or emission of substance as they did <a id="l2277"></a>who before the times of the Nicene Council preacht them consubstantial.  For this was then the vulgar notion of consubstantial. But <a id="l2279"></a>after the  time of this Council the first of the three errors became the <a id="l2280"></a>prevalent opinion.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 41r resumes &gt; </span> But the first was now the prevalent opinion. ffor the Council <a id="l2281"></a>of Sardica  held one  substance in this <a id="l2282"></a>sense as is manifest by their saying: <em class="underline">We confess that the Son <a id="l2283"></a>is the vertue of the father, we confess that he is the λόγος <a id="l2284"></a>word or reason of God the Father besides which there is no <a id="l2285"></a>other &amp; that the word is true God &amp; wisdom &amp; vertue</em>. This <a id="l2286"></a>they say in opposition to Arius who denyed the Son to <a id="l2287"></a>be the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος or that inward mind &amp; wisdom of the Father by <a id="l2288"></a>which he is intelligent &amp; wise, &amp; therefore their opinion was <a id="l2289"></a>that the Son is that λόγος ἐνδιάθετος or inward mind, that <a id="l2290"></a>is, the attribute of the hypostasis of the Deity.</p>
<p id="par135">Hence therefore when the Greeks condemned Mar<a id="l2291"></a>cellus of Sabellianism the Latines in the Councils of Rome <a id="l2292"></a>&amp; Sardica defended him as orthodox: thô afterwards <a id="l2293"></a>when they left their error &amp; he stuck to it, he <a id="l2294"></a>went for such a heretick as he had been condemned for.</p>
<p id="par136">Hence also when Hilary was sent for to the Council <a id="l2295"></a>of Seleucia, the Council in the first place required the faith of the Gaules, <a id="l2296"></a>because, saith Sulpitius Severus, the Arians had made the <a id="l2297"></a>eastern Churches beleive that the western were Sabelli<a id="l2298"></a>an: but when he expounded his faith according to the sense <a id="l2299"></a>of the Nicene Decree they readily admitted him. By which <a id="l2300"></a>circumstance it is manifest that it was not the Council <a id="l2301"></a>of Nice but the abuse of that Council which the eastern <a id="l2302"></a>Churches at that time laboured against.</p>
<p id="par137"> <sup>✝</sup> [Hence also many ….. ] <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 40v &gt; </span>Hence also many of the homousians for some time after the death of Constantius used <a id="l2303"></a>the language of one Hypostasis as Ierome, the Neocæsarienes &amp; the followers <a id="l2304"></a>of Paulinus Patriarch of Antioch who pleaded for this language the authority <a id="l2305"></a>of the Council of Sardica: but yet as many as used this language were <a id="l2306"></a>by the rest of the  homousians accounted Sabellians notwithstanding that <a id="l2307"></a>they distinguished the hypostasis or substance of the Deity into three  πρόσωπα or persons.</p>
<p id="par138">And as the eastern Bishops when the western began to call them Arians <a id="l2308"></a>to baffle that accusation anathematized the positions of Arius: so  the homo<a id="l2309"></a>usians after they had been baffled in the Councils of Ariminum &amp; Seleucia as <a id="l2310"></a>Sabellians,  to cleare themselves from that imputation made a great <a id="l2311"></a>noise against Sabellianism as you may see in their Councils which followed <a id="l2312"></a>the reign of Constantius.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 41r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par139">Those therefore who were for abolishing the word <a id="l2313"></a>homousios prest it by the abuse thereof. For in one <a id="l2314"></a>of the Creeds of the Councils of Sirmium &amp; Ariminum <a id="l2315"></a>&amp; that of Constantinople they decree that <em class="underline">the word <a id="l2316"></a>usia or substance, because it was unwarily put by <a id="l2317"></a>the</em> [Nicene] <em class="underline">ffathers, &amp; being not understood by the <a id="l2318"></a>people became a stumbling block to them, &amp; because <a id="l2319"></a>it was not in the scriptures, should be abolished</em>. And immediately after <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n66-ref">[66]</sup>  in that of Constantinople &amp; Ariminum they add: <a id="l2320"></a><em class="underline">Neither ought Hypostasis to be named of the Father <a id="l2321"></a>Son &amp; Holy Ghost</em>. They do not say hypostases but <a id="l2322"></a>hypostasis in the singular number, &amp; so condemned hereby <a id="l2323"></a>not the doctrine of three hypostases (for that was their <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p042r"> &lt;42r&gt; </span>but the Sardican confession of but one common hy<a id="l2324"></a>postasis of the Father Son &amp; Holy Ghost.</p>
<p id="par140">Hilary in his book de Synodis<sup class="note" id="n67-ref">[67]</sup>  mentions three reasons <a id="l2325"></a>by which the  Bishops he wrote to had been induced <a id="l2326"></a>to abrogate the word <em class="underline">homousios</em> in the Council of Sirmium: <a id="l2327"></a>the first of which was the scandal the word brought by <a id="l2328"></a>implying one former substance divided  into <a id="l2329"></a>two, the second that the use of the word had been condemned <a id="l2330"></a>in the Council of Antioch convened against Paul of Samo<a id="l2331"></a>sat about sixty years before the Council of Nice, <a id="l2332"></a>&amp; the third that the word was not extant in scripture: <a id="l2333"></a>&amp; a little after repeating the objection of scandal, he <a id="l2334"></a>saith <em class="underline">But perhaps it will be said this word ought to be <a id="l2335"></a>rejected because it uses to be corruptly understood</em>: <a id="l2336"></a>And again; <em class="underline">The homousios is understood in an ill sense: <a id="l2337"></a>what's that to me who understand it in a good one</em>? <a id="l2338"></a>And again; <em class="underline">But you will say the ambiguity of the  <a id="l2339"></a>homousios moves me with its scandal: Hear I pray without scan<a id="l2340"></a>dal &amp; the nakednesse of homæusios moves me</em>. He grants <a id="l2341"></a>that the homousios by reason of its ambiguity was apt to be misunderstood &amp; had been misunder<a id="l2342"></a>stood in the west &amp; yet is for continuing the use of it because <a id="l2343"></a>he understood it in a good sense &amp; others might do so too <a id="l2344"></a>if they pleased. For which end he takes much pains <a id="l2345"></a>in the latter end of this book to make the western <a id="l2346"></a>Bishops understand his notion of  una substantia as if <a id="l2347"></a>they had never heard of it before,  as I am apt to think <a id="l2351"></a>they had not because the Sardican faith had obteined <a id="l2352"></a>in the west &amp; met not with any opposition there till now, <a id="l2353"></a>nor was opposed now by any  but  those of the eastern communion. The <a id="l2355"></a>minor part was not now  opposed &amp; condemned <a id="l2356"></a>by the major but almost the whole west  were convinced of error by <a id="l2358"></a>the Acts of the Council of  Nice </p>
<p id="par141"> For when the Emperor &amp;c See the backside  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p043v"> &lt;43v&gt; </span>  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 42v &gt; </span>For when the Emperor Constantine the great  sitting in the middle <a id="l2372"></a>of the Bishops of the Council of Nice prest the word homousios upon the <a id="l2373"></a> Council:  they  for a time stiffly opposed  untill the  corrupt significations of the word  were re<a id="l2376"></a>jected &amp; such a signification as they could allow, proposed &amp; agreed upon. <a id="l2377"></a>For the word signifies either that a thing is of the same subst<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ance<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l2378"></a>with another or that it is of a like substance. ffor ὁμος sometimes <a id="l2379"></a>signifies <em class="underline">like</em> &amp; that in composition as well as alone, as in the word <a id="l2380"></a>ὁμοπαθὴς <em class="underline">obnoxious to like passions</em> ὁμόνεκρος <em class="underline">like a dead body as to <a id="l2381"></a>corruption</em>, ὁμόφλοιος <em class="underline">having a like bark</em>, &amp; in this sense ὁμοούσιος <a id="l2382"></a>signifies nothing more then ὁμοιούσιος <em class="underline">of like substance</em>. But vulgarly <a id="l2383"></a>the word then signified a thing  of the same substance with another <a id="l2384"></a>that is not consisting of the same substance but arisen out of the same <a id="l2385"></a>substance &amp; that either by division, projection eruption or efflux of <a id="l2386"></a>the substance. This sense of the word therefore according to these several  modes was first  considered in the Councel &amp; rejected <a id="l2388"></a>&amp; then the second sense agreed upon as you may see related at <a id="l2389"></a>large by Eusebius of Cæsarea in the <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n69-ref">[69]</sup> letter which he wrote at that <a id="l2390"></a>very time from the Council to his Church.

And upon the baffling of this signification in the Councils of Sirmium &amp; Ariminum there was a fourth signification put upon the word of a specific or generical unity: but the sense which the Council  it self put upon the word was not  any unity of substance but only a similitude,  as is manifest by the letter of Eusebius.</p>
<p id="par142">Now it was the custome of the Bishops in sub<a id="l2396"></a>scribing to expresse in a sentence or two what it <a id="l2397"></a>was to which they subscribed, &amp; when they subscribed with any caution or reservation to express it as you may see in the Acts <a id="l2398"></a>of the Councils of Ephesus &amp; Chalcedon &amp; the second of <a id="l2399"></a>Nice which are come to our hands entire. Whence <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n70-ref">[70]</sup>  Va<a id="l2400"></a>lesius conjectures that they subscribed at Nice after <a id="l2401"></a>some such manner as this <em class="underline">I Eusebius of Nicomedia <a id="l2402"></a>agree &amp; subscribe to the  faith above <a id="l2403"></a>written, but not to the anathema</em>.<sup> ✝</sup><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 42v &gt; </span> <sup>✝</sup> But  when the signification of the word ὁμοούσιος had been much <a id="l2404"></a>debated in the Council &amp; after many scruples &amp; exceptions a<a id="l2405"></a>greed upon: it is not to be imagined, that  those who had been scrupulous would subscribe <a id="l2406"></a>without expressing in what sense they took that word.  And therefore we are here beholden <a id="l2408"></a>to Philostorgius for letting us know the  matter of <a id="l2409"></a>fact. For in the end of the first book of his History, as Nicetas <a id="l2410"></a>relates out of him, he  related that in subscribing<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 43v resumes &gt; </span> that  <a id="l2413"></a>in subscribing the Nicene faith, some wrote over <a id="l2414"></a>against their names the word ὁμοούσιος, &amp; others by <a id="l2415"></a>the advice of Eusebius instead of ὁμοούσιος wrote <a id="l2416"></a>ὁμοιούσιος. Whence Photius saith that <em class="underline">they subscribed <a id="l2417"></a>fraudulently, even by the testimony of Philostorgius, be<a id="l2418"></a>cause under the word  ὁμοούσιος they <a id="l2419"></a>craftily hid the  ὁμοιούσιος:</em>  that is interpreted the first by the <a id="l2421"></a>last. If you can beleive with Photius that one <a id="l2422"></a>part of the Council (&amp; if we may judge by all the <a id="l2423"></a>following Councils of the east, the much greater part,) <a id="l2424"></a>were such knaves as to do this fraudulently &amp;  <a id="l2425"></a>Constantine the great with the rest of the Council such <a id="l2426"></a>fools as to  look on &amp; let them do it <a id="l2427"></a>fraudulently, you'l make a fine Council on't. But it has <a id="l2428"></a>been the constant practise of the Catholicks to cry out <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p044r"> &lt;44r&gt; </span>fraud at every thing which makes against 'em before they <a id="l2429"></a>know whether it be so or not &amp; thereby they have <a id="l2430"></a>corrupted all history.</p>
<p id="par143">So then the Nicene Fathers first in their debates <a id="l2431"></a>agreed that ὁμοούσιος signified nothing more then that the <a id="l2432"></a>Son was of like substance with the father, that is, that <a id="l2433"></a>he was ὁμοιούσιος to him, &amp; then by way of caution <a id="l2434"></a>exprest this interpretation in their subscriptions. And at <a id="l2435"></a>length the eastern Bishops by shewing the Acts of <a id="l2436"></a>the Council with these subscriptions, convinced the <a id="l2437"></a>western Bishops that they had misinterpreted the Ni<a id="l2438"></a>cene Creed. For Sulpitius Severus speaking of the times <a id="l2439"></a>of the Councils of Millain &amp; Sirmium saith that the Arians <a id="l2440"></a>(he means all those in communion with the eastern <a id="l2441"></a>Churches) began to preach their heresy  openly <em class="underline">&amp; in<a id="l2442"></a>terpreting the Nicene Council on their side which by the <a id="l2443"></a>addition of one letter they had corrupted, cast a mist before <a id="l2444"></a>the truth. ffor where  ὁμοούσιον was written, which is <a id="l2445"></a> of one substance, they said that ὁμοιούσιον was written <a id="l2446"></a>which is of like substance; granting a similitude so they <a id="l2447"></a>might but take away the unity</em>. By this means, saith Seve<a id="l2448"></a>rus, they cast a mist before the truth, that is  they deceived the western Bishops: &amp; by consequence those Bishops <a id="l2450"></a>who had the sight of the Nicene records &amp; were  most <a id="l2451"></a>concerned to find out the cheat if  there <a id="l2452"></a>had been any, could find out none, but were convinced <a id="l2453"></a>by what they saw. Hosius himself who knew what was done at Nice could find out none but yielded with the rest. And therefore I wonder how Severus many years <a id="l2454"></a>after  all these things, without so much as seing the original Acts, came to know there <a id="l2455"></a>was a cheat. But this has been the constant practise <a id="l2456"></a>of the Moncks to misrepresent &amp; corrupt  all things by <a id="l2457"></a>pretending  (without proof) that hereticks had <a id="l2458"></a>corrupted them before.  dispute  Its enough that the age before him when these things were in agitation suspected no such fallacy. And how far they were from suspecting any may yet further appear by the following evidence. For <a id="l2462"></a>the Council of Illyricum collected about six or <a id="l2463"></a>seven years after that of Ariminum when all <a id="l2464"></a>things were fresh in memory, composed a Creed of <a id="l2465"></a>which this was the summ. <sup class="note" id="n71-ref">[71]</sup>  <em class="underline">We confesse according to the <a id="l2466"></a>great &amp; orthodox Synod that the Son is  homousios <a id="l2467"></a>to the father. Neither do we so understand homousios <a id="l2468"></a>as some heretofore expounded it who did not subscribe <a id="l2469"></a>sincerely &amp; according to the truth &amp; as some now who</em>  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p044v"> &lt;44v&gt; </span> <em class="underline">call those men Fathers, abolishing the force of this word <a id="l2470"></a>&amp; treading in their steps who wrote that the word homo<a id="l2471"></a>usios denoted similitude in that the Son was like none of the <a id="l2472"></a>creatures which were made by him but bare the similitude <a id="l2473"></a>of the Father  alone. For they that thus expound it, <a id="l2474"></a>do impiously teach that the Son of God is an excellent <a id="l2475"></a>&amp; most noble creature</em>. All this plainly respects the <a id="l2476"></a>Council of Nice: for that was the great &amp; orthodox Synod, <a id="l2477"></a>the only Synod wherein the homousios was subscribed &amp; the <a id="l2478"></a>Synod wherein it was interpreted  of similitude in that <a id="l2479"></a>the Son was not like the creatures made by him but like the father <a id="l2480"></a>only, as you may see in the above mentioned letter of <a id="l2481"></a>Eusebius. Whence its plain not only that the  Nicene <a id="l2482"></a>ffathers subscribed after this manner but also that the Greek <a id="l2483"></a>Churches during the reigns of Constantius &amp; Valens did  own this Council &amp; by vertue of these <a id="l2485"></a>subscriptions plead it on their side: &amp; that it was from <a id="l2486"></a>thence that the language of ὁμοιούσιος had its rise &amp; was spread so easily <a id="l2487"></a> over all the east.</p>

<h2 id="hd27" class="cent">  Quest. <a id="l2511"></a><br>Whether Athanasius did not set on foot <a id="l2512"></a>the invocation of saints.</h2>
<p id="par145">The Christians of the first ages taught that at the day <a id="l2513"></a>of judgment, Christ would sentence some immediately to heaven <a id="l2514"></a>others to perpetual torments &amp; others to be baptized with fire <a id="l2515"></a>&amp; shut up in prizon till they should pay the outermost farthing. <a id="l2516"></a>What was the state of souls between death &amp; the day of <a id="l2517"></a>judgment the Greek Churches of those ages  (so far as I <a id="l2518"></a>can find)  determined not till Athanasius in the life of <a id="l2519"></a>Antony by relating how Antony saw the soul of Ammon <a id="l2520"></a>ascend up to heaven, brought in an opinion that the souls of <a id="l2521"></a>the blessed went immediately after death to heaven &amp; by consequence <a id="l2522"></a>that those of the wicked went immediately to hell &amp; those <a id="l2523"></a>of the middle  degree to Purgatory. And because its absurd <a id="l2524"></a>that  men should be rewarded before they are <a id="l2525"></a>judged therefore the Athanasians have feigned  without <a id="l2526"></a>any foundation in scripture that  there is a double judgment, the first <a id="l2528"></a>particular of every man at his death &amp; the second general. <a id="l2529"></a>And to make out this opinion they allege the promise of <a id="l2530"></a>Christ to the thief which if rightly pointed may run thus. <em class="underline">Verily <a id="l2531"></a>I say unto the to day, Thou shalt be with me in paradise</em> <a id="l2532"></a>the words <em class="underline">I say say unto the to day</em> being opposed by way <a id="l2533"></a>of answer to the thiefs petition, <em class="underline">Remember me when thou <a id="l2534"></a>comest into thy kingdom</em>. They allege also the  Parable of  <a id="l2535"></a>Dives &amp; Lazarus applying it to the present time, whereas <a id="l2536"></a>if they had  the same notion of the last day with the first Christians they would under<a id="l2537"></a>stand that it might as well belong to that time: &amp; besides <a id="l2538"></a>it is but a Parable.  They press also S. Paul's saying <em class="underline">I desire to be dissolved &amp; be with Christ</em>: not considering that the interval between death &amp; the resurrection is to them that sleep &amp; perceive it not, a moment. They # # They argue also from the vision of Moses &amp; Elias with Christ, thô  the vision was not of their souls (for Elias never died) but of their living bodies.

<p id="par146">Now according to the tenour of these texts of scripture <a id="l2577"></a> the first Christians placed all the dead in Hades, that <a id="l2578"></a>is, not in hell as we corruptly translate the word, but in the <a id="l2579"></a>land of darknesse &amp; silence as the old testament sometimes <a id="l2580"></a>expresseth it. Whence came the opinion that Christ descending <a id="l2581"></a>into Hades brought with him from thence the Souls of the <a id="l2582"></a>Patriarchs. But the Egyptians, Platonists &amp; other heathens placed the souls of  the better sort of dead men <a id="l2583"></a>about their sepulchers &amp; statues &amp;  temples &amp; in the <a id="l2584"></a>air &amp; in heaven &amp; so filled all places wth ghosts or <a id="l2585"></a>Dæmons . And Athanasius by  making Antony see the soule of Ammon <a id="l2586"></a>ascend  up to heaven, laid the foundation for introducing <a id="l2587"></a> into the greek Churches  this hea<a id="l2589"></a>then  doctrine of Daemons,  together with that <a id="l2590"></a>Popish  one of Purgatory. And this I take to be the true <a id="l2591"></a>original of  worshipping Saints in the Greek Church <a id="l2592"></a>for Athanasius in the end of his Epistle to Marcelline concerning the <a id="l2593"></a>interpretation of the Psalms written in a time of <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n72-ref">[72]</sup>  temptation or <a id="l2594"></a>trial (as he calls it) &amp; by consequence before the death of <a id="l2595"></a>Iulian the Apostate,  lays down this doctrine. <em class="underline">Let <a id="l2596"></a>not any one</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">adorn the Psalms with secular <a id="l2597"></a>words for eloquence, nor let him endeavour to change <a id="l2598"></a>the words, or wholy to substitute one thing for another: but <a id="l2599"></a>let him recite &amp; sing them as they are written, <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n73-ref">[73]</sup> that the <a id="l2600"></a>saints who composed those words,  knowing them to be <a id="l2601"></a>their own, may pray together with us</em>. And a little after. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p056r"> &lt;56r&gt; </span><em class="underline">When the Devils  see the words  changed they deride them but <a id="l2602"></a>are afraid of the words of the saints &amp; cannot beare them</em>. <a id="l2603"></a> In these words Athanasius teaches three things, that the saints <a id="l2604"></a>understand what we say,  that they intercede with God for us, <a id="l2605"></a>&amp; that in certain forms of words there are supernatural <a id="l2606"></a> virtues: &amp; these  principles  readily inferr saint-worship &amp; charms.</p>
<p id="par147">✝ What Athanasius taught in Egypt &amp;c [See the bakside of the next leaf.] <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 57v &gt; </span> ✝ And what Athanasius taught in Egypt soon went into  <a id="l2608"></a>Syria ffor <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n74-ref">[74]</sup>  Sozomen describing how the Oracle at Antioch consulted <a id="l2609"></a>by the Emperor Iulian was silenced by the reliques of that Martyr <a id="l2610"></a>Babylas &amp; caused the bones of the Martyr to be carried out, &amp; how the <a id="l2611"></a>Temple with the speaking statue was thereupon burnt he adds: ἐδόκει δὲ τοις μὲν <a id="l2612"></a>Χριστιανοις κατ᾽ ἄιτησιν του μάρτυρος &amp;c The Christians thought this <a id="l2613"></a>fire sent by God upon the Dæmon at the prayer of the Martyr; but <a id="l2614"></a>the Gentiles said the wickedness was done by the Christians. The truth <a id="l2615"></a>of the story I take to be this: that the Heathen Priests caused  some body to speak through the <a id="l2617"></a>Oracle &amp; command away the bones of some dead man as if they were <a id="l2618"></a>the bones of a martyr &amp; therefore offensive &amp; abominable to the God: <a id="l2619"></a>&amp; that the saint worshipping Christians inverted the story as if the Oracle was silenced <a id="l2620"></a>&amp; the temple set on fire by the power &amp; intercession of the mar<a id="l2621"></a>tyr. And this sufficiently shews that the intercession of the Saints &amp; their <a id="l2622"></a>knowledge of things done on earth was  in the reign of that Empe<a id="l2623"></a>ror the received opinion of the Athanasians at Antioch.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 56r resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par148">Now these doctrines were no sooner started in  the east <a id="l2624"></a>but Hilary in his return thence from banishment carried them <a id="l2625"></a>with him into the west. For in his commentary upon the <a id="l2626"></a>129<sup>th</sup> Psalm, he saith,<sup class="note" id="n75-ref">[75]</sup>  <em class="underline">It is not the nature of God but our <a id="l2627"></a>infirmity which wants the intercession of Angels. ffor <a id="l2628"></a>they are sent  because of them who shall inherit salvation, God <a id="l2629"></a>being ignorant of none of those things which we do, but our <a id="l2630"></a>infirmity wanting the ministry of spiritual intercession to <a id="l2631"></a>ask &amp;  obtein</em>. And again upon Psal 124 he saith: <em class="underline">Neither <a id="l2632"></a>are the protections of  saints nor the guardes of  Angels <a id="l2633"></a>wanting to those who are willing to stand</em>. And a little after <a id="l2634"></a><em class="underline">And least you should  beleive  it a light safeguard which is placed <a id="l2635"></a>in the Aposles  Patriarchs &amp; Prophets or rather in <a id="l2636"></a>Angels who fence about the Church with a certain protection <a id="l2637"></a>it is added, And the Lord is round about his people from <a id="l2638"></a>hence forth &amp; for ever. But perhaps the Protection of the <a id="l2639"></a>Apostles &amp; Angels may be thought sufficient. It is <a id="l2640"></a>true, but</em> &amp;c. Thus far Hilary who died four years <a id="l2641"></a>before Athanasius, A.C. 368. You have heard above how in the year <a id="l2642"></a>360 he credited the miracles done  in the east by the  martyrs at their tombs, &amp; that at the same time <a id="l2644"></a>he learnt the doctrine of the protection &amp; intercession of <a id="l2645"></a>Saints &amp; Angels is not much to be  doubted. For these <a id="l2646"></a>things  were naturally joyned <a id="l2647"></a>together.</p>
<p id="par149">And that the invocation of Saints came in at the <a id="l2648"></a>same time I seem to gather from  the works of Basil &amp; Ephem Syrus who  were <a id="l2650"></a>contemporaries to Athanasius &amp; died six years after him, A.C. <a id="l2651"></a>378. For Basil in his 20<sup>th</sup> Homily upon the 40 martyrs saith: <a id="l2652"></a>These are they who obteining our region,  like certain <a id="l2653"></a>towers afford a  refuge against the  incursion <a id="l2654"></a>of the enemy. —— Here is prepared a help to Christians, <a id="l2655"></a>namely a church of martyrs, an army of triumphers, a chorus <a id="l2656"></a>of such as praise God. You have often endeavoured, you <a id="l2657"></a>have often laboured to find one who should pray for you; <a id="l2658"></a>these are fourty, sending forth one voice of prayer. ffor where <a id="l2659"></a>two or three are gathered together in the name of the Lord <a id="l2660"></a>there God is; but where there shall be 40, who doubts that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p057r"> &lt;57r&gt; </span> God is present. ὁ θλιβόμενος ἐσπι τοὺς τεσσαράκοντα <a id="l2661"></a>καταφεύγει, ὁ ἐυφραινόμενος ἐπὶ ἀυτοὺς ἀποτρεχει <a id="l2662"></a>ὁ μὲν ἵνα λύσιν ευρη των δυσχερων, ὁ δὲ ἵνα φυ<a id="l2663"></a>λαχθη ἁυτω τὰ χρὴστότερα,  <em class="underline">He that is in  <a id="l2664"></a>affliction flees to these fourty, he that rejoyces runs <a id="l2665"></a>to them: the first that he may be delivered from the <a id="l2666"></a>evils, the last that the  good things may be <a id="l2667"></a>continued to him.

For in his 18<sup>th</sup> Oration<sup class="note" id="n82-ref">[82]</sup>  <a id="l2752"></a>on the life of Cyprian he tells it for true matter of fact <a id="l2753"></a>that Iustina a virgin whom Cyprian before his conversion endeavoured by magic arts to enjoy prayed to the Virgin Mary (&amp; that not in vain) <a id="l2754"></a>that she would deliver her from the danger she was in:  This I take to <a id="l2756"></a>be a fable invented by the Monks for promoting the worship <a id="l2757"></a>of the Virgin Mary, but  whilst Gregory beleived it, <a id="l2758"></a>it shews that he was in earnest when in the end of this <a id="l2759"></a>Oration he thus invoked Cyprian. <em class="underline">But thou</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">look <a id="l2760"></a>down upon us benignly from heaven &amp; govern our discourses <a id="l2761"></a>&amp; life &amp;   this sacred flock, or assist  in feeding them, as well directing  it in <a id="l2762"></a>other things as far as may be to the best, as  removing <a id="l2763"></a>grievous wolves who carp at syllables &amp; words, &amp;  granting <a id="l2764"></a>us a more full &amp; clear splendor of the holy Trinity <a id="l2765"></a>before which  thou now standest</em>. So again in the end of his <a id="l2766"></a>21<sup>th</sup> Oration,<sup class="note" id="n83-ref">[83]</sup>   he thus invokes the soul <a id="l2767"></a>of Athanasius. <em class="underline">Do thou look down upon us benignly from <a id="l2768"></a>above &amp; govern this people a perfect adorer of the tri<a id="l2769"></a>nity which is understood &amp; worshipped in the father Son &amp; <a id="l2770"></a>holy ghost: &amp; if there shall be peace preserve me in <a id="l2771"></a>life &amp; assist in feeding my flock,  but if the Church <a id="l2772"></a>shall  be in warr, withdraw me or assume me &amp; place <a id="l2773"></a>me with  thy self &amp; such as are like  thee, althô it <a id="l2774"></a>be a great thing which I request</em>.  And much after the same <a id="l2775"></a>manner he invokes his own father Gregory &amp; his friend <a id="l2776"></a>Basil in his  19<sup>th</sup> &amp; 20<sup>th</sup> Orations: the former of which <a id="l2777"></a>was had in the presence of Basil soon after his fathers <a id="l2778"></a>death, A.C. 372.</p>

<p id="par153">Gregory Nyssen  in the life of Ephræm <a id="l2780"></a>Syrus, telling how  a certain man in returning home from <a id="l2781"></a>a long journey was in great danger by reason that all the <a id="l2782"></a>ways were stopt with the forces of barbarians subjoyns that <a id="l2783"></a>he only invoked Ephraem saying <em class="underline">Holy Ephræm help me</em>, &amp; so <a id="l2784"></a>escaped the danger beyond hope being fortified by the protection <a id="l2785"></a>of Ephræm.  <a id="l2787"></a>Whence you may know that Gregory in the end of this Life <a id="l2788"></a>where he invokes  the ghost of Ephræm,  was in <a id="l2789"></a>good earnest. The same Gregory in his Oration on Theo<a id="l2790"></a>dorus the Martyr, saith: <em class="underline">This martyr, as we beleive, the <a id="l2791"></a>last year</em> [that is A.C. 380] <em class="underline">allayed the Barbarian tempest <a id="l2792"></a>&amp; checkt &amp; represt the horrid war of the fierce &amp; cruel <a id="l2793"></a>Scythians</em> &amp;c.

And at length Gregory concludes <a id="l2810"></a>his Oration with this prayer. We want [O Theodorus] many <a id="l2811"></a>benefits. Intercede &amp; deprecate for thy country with our common <a id="l2812"></a>king &amp; Lord. ffor the country of the martyr is the place of his <a id="l2813"></a>passion,  &amp; his citizens &amp; brethren &amp; kindred are they that <a id="l2814"></a>keep &amp; defend &amp; adorn &amp; honour him. We fear afflictions, we <a id="l2815"></a>expect dangers. The wicked Scythians are not far off being <a id="l2816"></a>ready to make war upon us. ὡς στρατιώτης, ὑπερμάχησον. <a id="l2817"></a>ὡς μάρτυς ὑπὲρ των ὁμοδούλων χρησαι τη παρρησία, as a <a id="l2818"></a>souldier fight for us, as a martyr use liberty of speech for <a id="l2819"></a>us. Intreat peace that these publick assemblies may not cease <a id="l2820"></a>that the furious &amp; wicked barbarian may not rage against the <a id="l2821"></a>temples &amp; altars, that the profane &amp; wicked may not trample <a id="l2822"></a>upon the holy things. ffor we also, that we are hitherto pre<a id="l2823"></a>served safe &amp; sound, do acknowledge the benefit  received of you <a id="l2824"></a>but we pray also for safety for the time to come. And if <a id="l2825"></a>there is need also of greater intercession &amp; deprecation, call <a id="l2826"></a>together the chorus of your brothers the martyrs &amp; together <a id="l2827"></a>with them all deprecate for us. The prayers of many just <a id="l2828"></a>blot out the sins of multitudes &amp; nations. Admonish Peter, <a id="l2829"></a>stir up Paul &amp; Iohn the divine &amp; beloved disciple that they <a id="l2830"></a>may be sollicitous for the Churches which they have constituted <a id="l2831"></a>for which they have born chains, for which they have suffered <a id="l2832"></a>dangers &amp; deaths, least the worship of Idols lift up the head <a id="l2833"></a>against us, least hereses grow up like thorns in the vineyard <a id="l2834"></a>least tares springing up choak the wheat, least any rock <a id="l2835"></a>wanting the unctuousness of sincere dew stand up against <a id="l2836"></a>us &amp; render the  power of fruitfulness of the word void <a id="l2837"></a>of root.

Thus <a id="l2840"></a> Gregory wrote in the year 381 &amp; <a id="l2841"></a>the same year in an Oration had at Constantinople <a id="l2842"></a>in the funeral of Meletius Patriarch of Antioch, he <a id="l2843"></a>exprest himself thus: <em class="underline">The Bridegroom</em>, saith he,  speaking of <a id="l2844"></a>Meletius, <em class="underline">is not taken from us: he stands in the middle <a id="l2845"></a>of us althô we do not see him. He is a Priest in the <a id="l2846"></a> most Holy – &amp; face to face intercedes <a id="l2847"></a>with God for us &amp; for the sins of the people</em>. This Gre<a id="l2848"></a>gory taught before the Bishops of the Council of Constantinople <a id="l2849"></a>commonly called the second general Council, in the time of <a id="l2850"></a>whose session Meletius died. <em class="underline">Whence you may understand</em> <a id="l2851"></a>(to use the words of <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n84-ref">[84]</sup>  Baronius) <em class="underline">that he profest what the Coun<a id="l2852"></a>cil &amp; with it the whole Church of those parts now be<a id="l2853"></a>leived, namely that the saints do pour out prayers before <a id="l2854"></a>God for us</em>.</p>
<p id="par154">I have hitherto described the state of the Greek Church <a id="l2855"></a> as to saint worship  in the times <a id="l2856"></a>preceding this Council. And by comparing all that has been <a id="l2857"></a>said it seems to me not only that this worship was gene<a id="l2858"></a>rally received by the Athanasians before the time of <a id="l2859"></a>this Council but also that it was received with great ardor <a id="l2860"></a>&amp; affection. Nor did they only invoke the Saints as intercessors <a id="l2861"></a>&amp; mediators but also as  Protectors, Rulers &amp; Coad<a id="l2862"></a>jutors. They accounted them the bulwarks towers &amp; guards of their <a id="l2863"></a>Cities, &amp; the Patrons &amp; Guardians of their persons;  they <a id="l2864"></a>ascribed deliverances, victories, cures of diseases &amp; other miraculous <a id="l2865"></a>operations to them &amp; to their reliques; they prayed that they <a id="l2866"></a>would assist, defend,  govern &amp; prosper them &amp; their Churches, &amp; after <a id="l2867"></a>death receive them into heaven: all which is the highest de<a id="l2868"></a>gree of  worship. I will not give it a hard name but leave the reader to consider it. And this was the original of <a id="l2869"></a>distributing kingdoms, Cities, towns, companies, &amp; persons amongst <a id="l2870"></a>the Saints so as to assigne to each their proper  guardians.</p>
<p id="par155">I might add more concerning the  vehement <a id="l2871"></a>superstition of this age. For tho Athanasianism began <a id="l2872"></a>not in Constantinople till after the reign of Valens, yet <a id="l2873"></a>before the end of the reign of Theodosius the devotion <a id="l2874"></a>towards saints was there grown to such a height that in <a id="l2875"></a>the year 394, when Theodosius was setting forth against <a id="l2876"></a>Eugenius, <em class="underline">he prepared to the war</em>, saith Ruffin,<sup class="note" id="n85-ref">[85]</sup>  <em class="underline">not so much <a id="l2877"></a>with  the power of arms &amp; weapons as with that of fastings &amp; prayers,  &amp; being</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p046r"> &lt;46r&gt; </span><em class="underline">fortified not so much with the <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> of his guards as with <a id="l2878"></a>pernoctation in prayer, he together with the Priests &amp; people <a id="l2879"></a>went about all the places of prayer,  &amp; lay prostrate <a id="l2880"></a>in hair-cloth before the tombs of the Martyrs &amp; prayed <a id="l2881"></a>for aid &amp; assistance by the faithful intercession of the mar<a id="l2882"></a>tyrs</em>. And Sozomen adds that when he was  marched seven miles <a id="l2883"></a>from Constantinople he prayed there  in a church which he had <a id="l2884"></a>built to Iohn the Baptist,  καὶ σύμμαχον ἀυτω ἐπικαλέσεσθαι <a id="l2885"></a>τὸν βαπτιστήν  &amp; called <a id="l2886"></a>upon the Baptist to assist him in the warr. This is that <a id="l2887"></a>Theodosius  who for setting up <a id="l2888"></a>Athanasianism has  been honoured with the name of Theodosius the great.</p>
<p id="par156">And indeed so great was the devotion of this age towards <a id="l2889"></a>the Saints that Chrysostom in his exposition on the 114<sup>th</sup> Psalm neare the end, said πρὸς των μαρτύρων τοὺς τάφους τὰς <a id="l2891"></a>πόλεις συντρεχούσας, τοὺς δήμους ἀναπτομένους τω πόθω. <a id="l2892"></a><em class="underline"> The cities ran together to the sepulchers of the mar<a id="l2893"></a>tyrs &amp; the peoples were inflamed with affection toward them</em>. <a id="l2894"></a>And hence  he sometimes endeavours to check <a id="l2895"></a>this devotion &amp; perswade the people to let God  have <a id="l2896"></a>a  fit share of their prayers. So in Gen.19 Hom 44 he <a id="l2897"></a>saith: <em class="underline">When we bring what is from our selves &amp; to this is <a id="l2898"></a>added the intercession of saints, it profits us very much: but <a id="l2899"></a>if we are negligent &amp; place the hope of our salvation <a id="l2900"></a>in them alone, it profits us no more at all. —— Know<a id="l2901"></a>ing this beloved let us fly to the prayers of the saints &amp; <a id="l2902"></a>pray that they would intercede for us: but let us not trust <a id="l2903"></a>in their prayers alone, but also let us dispense our own <a id="l2904"></a>rightly, as is fit</em>. And after the same manner he <a id="l2905"></a>exhorts the people again in Matt. 2. Hom. 5. <em class="underline">Therefore</em>, <a id="l2906"></a>saith he, <em class="underline">let us not with oscitancy &amp; sloth depend upon the <a id="l2907"></a>merits of others. For in truth the prayers &amp; supplications of the saints <a id="l2908"></a> are powerful for us &amp; that <a id="l2909"></a>exceedingly, but it is then when we also desire the same <a id="l2910"></a>thing through repentance</em>. And  a little after. <em class="underline">We <a id="l2911"></a>say these things not  to deny that the <a id="l2912"></a>saints are to be  prayed unto, but least we should <a id="l2913"></a>resolve our selves into idleness &amp; sloth, &amp; sleeping ourselves <a id="l2914"></a>commit our concerns  wholy to the care of others</em>. So then <a id="l2915"></a>the Athanasians before the end of the fourth Century <a id="l2916"></a>had run almost all their devotion into saint-worship; <a id="l2917"></a>being inflamed beyond measure by the great cry of miracles the example of the Monks &amp; the <a id="l2918"></a>preaching of their Clergy:  so that this devotion seems <a id="l2919"></a>to have been now at its height. For how much the Clergy <a id="l2920"></a>preached up this superstition may be guest by what we find  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p046v"> &lt;46v&gt; </span> in  the Homilies &amp; Orations of Chrysostom <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> <a id="l2921"></a>his Oration to the Antiochians  on the Martyrs <a id="l2922"></a>Bernice &amp; Prosdoce, he saith: <em class="underline">Perhaps ye burn with <a id="l2923"></a>not a little love towards those saints. With this ardour there<a id="l2924"></a>fore let us fall down before their reliques let us embrace <a id="l2925"></a>their coffins. ffor the coffins of the martyrs   may obtain <a id="l2926"></a>great virtue, even as the bones of the martyrs have great <a id="l2927"></a>efficacy. Nor on the day of this festivity only but also <a id="l2928"></a>on other days let us sit by them, let us beseech them, l<a id="l2929"></a>et us intreat them to be our Patrons. ffor they have <a id="l2930"></a>great assurance not only when living but also when <a id="l2931"></a>dead &amp; much more when dead. ffor now they bear <a id="l2932"></a>the marks of Christ &amp; when they shall shew these marks <a id="l2933"></a>they can obtain all things of the King. Seing therefore <a id="l2934"></a>they have so great power &amp; so great friendship with <a id="l2935"></a>the King: when  we sitting by them as it were continu<a id="l2936"></a>ally &amp; by visiting them perpetually have insinuated our <a id="l2937"></a>selves into their acquaintance, we shal by their help <a id="l2938"></a>obtein the mercy of God</em>. And much after the same <a id="l2939"></a>manner Chrysostom exhorts the  Antiochians in his Oration <a id="l2940"></a>on Iuventinus &amp; Maximus, &amp; in a general Oration on the <a id="l2941"></a>Martyrs he has these words. <em class="underline">But do you desire to enjoy <a id="l2942"></a>delights? Sit at the Sepulcher of the Martyr, there pour out <a id="l2943"></a>fountains of tears, afflict your soul, carry away a blessing <a id="l2944"></a>from the sepulcher, &amp; enjoying his patronage in your prayers, <a id="l2945"></a>exercise your self frequently in reading the relations of <a id="l2946"></a>his conflicts, embrace the coffin, adhere to the box of reliques. <a id="l2947"></a>ffor not only the bones of the martyrs but also their sepulchers <a id="l2948"></a>&amp; coffins abound with many blessings</em>. How much this Author <a id="l2949"></a>promoted these superstitions   may be further seen in <a id="l2953"></a>many other <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n86-ref">[86]</sup>  places &amp; yet the people ran it to a higher pitch <a id="l2954"></a>then he could approve of: so that he found it requisite to <a id="l2955"></a>exhort them to let God have a competent share of their <a id="l2956"></a> prayers. For their devotion towards the saints being enflamed <a id="l2957"></a>by the cry of  miracles , seems to have been in this <a id="l2958"></a>age at so much a greater  pitch  then in those which followed, <a id="l2959"></a>as the cry of miracles was now greater.</p>
<p id="par157">If you desire a  general description of the state of the <a id="l2960"></a>Church as to this worship, you may find it in the 8<sup>th</sup> Book of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p047r"> &lt;47r&gt; </span> Theodoret (the Ecclesiastical historian) De curandis Græcorum affectionibus written neare <a id="l2961"></a>the beginning of the fift Cent. A.C. 40 <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> For he in <a id="l2962"></a> that book writes thus. <em class="underline">The souls of the triumphant martyrs <a id="l2963"></a>live now in a heavenly country amongst the  Quires <a id="l2964"></a>of Angels: and their bodies are not entombed severally in <a id="l2965"></a>several monuments, but  divided &amp; <a id="l2966"></a>distributed amongst the cities &amp; villages, who call them saviors <a id="l2967"></a>of their souls &amp; physitians of their bodies &amp; venerate them <a id="l2968"></a>as the Guardians of cities &amp; Presidents of places, &amp;  through their <a id="l2969"></a>mediation &amp; intercessions with God, obtein by them divine guifts. <a id="l2970"></a>In their bodies therefore  though cut in pieces, yet the virtue &amp; grace <a id="l2971"></a> continues entire; &amp; those little reliques how little <a id="l2972"></a>soever have the same virtue with the whole undivided martyr. <a id="l2973"></a>ffor the grace which continues powerful &amp; vigorous distributes guifts <a id="l2974"></a>to them that ask, measuring its liberality by the faith of the <a id="l2975"></a>petitioners. —— These are therefore the Captains, Princes, <a id="l2976"></a>Guardians, Keepers of men, by who misfortunes are averted, <a id="l2977"></a> &amp; the evils which the Devils bring <a id="l2978"></a>upon us are driven far away</em>.

Yea they study to <a id="l3021"></a>impose their names on their new born children, <a id="l3022"></a>thence  providing security &amp; protection to them. But why <a id="l3023"></a>do I commemorate Philosophers &amp; Emperors &amp; Commad<sup>es</sup> <a id="l3024"></a>since the saints have abolished out of men's minds the <a id="l3025"></a>memory of them who were every where accounted Gods? <a id="l3026"></a>For the Temples of these are so destroyed that there remains <a id="l3027"></a>not so much as the  species of their shapes nor do <a id="l3028"></a>the men of this age know the forms of their altars: <a id="l3029"></a>but all the materials of these are assigned to the temples <a id="l3030"></a>of the Martyrs. For the Lord our God hath brought his <a id="l3031"></a>dead men into the temples instead of your Gods &amp; hath <a id="l3032"></a>made them  void &amp; vain, but hath attributed <a id="l3033"></a>their honour to these. ffor your  Pandiums &amp; <a id="l3034"></a>Diasiums &amp; Dionysiums &amp; other ffeasts, the solemnities of <a id="l3035"></a>Peter &amp; Paul &amp; Thomas &amp; Sergius &amp; Marcellus &amp; Leontia <a id="l3036"></a>&amp; Panteleemon &amp; Antoninus &amp; Mauritius &amp; other Martyrs. <a id="l3037"></a>—— Seeing therefore you understand what advantage  <a id="l3038"></a>accrues by  doing honour to the saints, shun, ô my friends, <a id="l3039"></a>the error of Dæmons &amp; by the previous light &amp; guide <a id="l3040"></a>of the saints take that way which leads to God</em>. <a id="l3041"></a>Thus far Theodoret: by all which you may understand <a id="l3042"></a>that Saint-worship was now of  long standing &amp; full <a id="l3043"></a>growth.</p>
<p id="par158">And whilst Theodoret endeavours by the affinity <a id="l3044"></a>between this religion &amp; heathenism to perswade <a id="l3045"></a>the heathens to come over to it: this opens the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p048r"> &lt;48r&gt; </span> meaning of that crafty politician Athanasius in setting <a id="l3046"></a>it up. For when he found himself by means of the <a id="l3047"></a>Councils of Sirmium Ariminum &amp; Seleucia  baffled &amp; <a id="l3048"></a>deserted by all but the Monks: he contrived his religion <a id="l3049"></a>for the easy conversion of the heathens  <a id="l3050"></a>by bringing into it as much of the heathen superstitions <a id="l3051"></a>as the  name of Christi<a id="l3052"></a>anity would then bear. ffor when the heathens saw <a id="l3053"></a>two sorts of Christianity, the one unlike the other <a id="l3054"></a>like their own religion: it must needs be that they <a id="l3055"></a>would more readily embrace the latter. And this I take <a id="l3056"></a>to be the true original of heathen ceremonies &amp; super<a id="l3057"></a>stitions which continue to this day in the Greek &amp; Latine <a id="l3058"></a>Churches. ffor who sees not that those superstitions <a id="l3059"></a>came into Christianity while heathenism was yet in <a id="l3060"></a>being? And who besides Athanasius had either opportunity <a id="l3061"></a>or authority enough to bring them in. For Gregory <a id="l3062"></a>Nazianzen tells us that in &amp; after the reign of Iulian <a id="l3063"></a>Athanasius <em class="underline">gave laws again to the world &amp; turned all <a id="l3064"></a>mens minds upon him</em>: That  <em class="underline">whatsoever <a id="l3065"></a>pleased him was a law to the Monks &amp; whatsoever he <a id="l3066"></a>disallowed they accounted forbidden, &amp; they looked upon <a id="l3067"></a>his opinions as the Tables of Moses, &amp; had him in <a id="l3068"></a>greater veneration  then became holy men</em>: &amp; that <a id="l3069"></a>when he had lead such a  course of life <em class="underline">that <a id="l3070"></a>his life  was the rule of episcopacy, &amp; his opinions <a id="l3071"></a>the law of orthodoxy</em> he died in a good old age. Twas <a id="l3072"></a>this authority &amp; none but this which could bring into <a id="l3073"></a> the religion of his party,  <a id="l3074"></a>monstrous Legends fals miracles, veneration of re<a id="l3075"></a>liques,  charmes, the doctrine <a id="l3076"></a>of Ghosts or Dæmons,  <a id="l3077"></a>&amp; their intercession invocation &amp; worship &amp; such other heathen super<a id="l3078"></a>stitions as were then brought in. ffor  as we have <a id="l3079"></a>shewed that he did allow these things so had he <a id="l3080"></a>disallowed them his party would not have received <a id="l3081"></a>them. With a word speaking he might have blasted <a id="l3082"></a>them. In the end of the reign of Constantius &amp; Iulian <a id="l3083"></a>when his party  had been baffled &amp; broken to pieces &amp; he <a id="l3084"></a>was deserted &amp; left to begin anew, when those few of <a id="l3085"></a>his party which remained were of many opinions &amp; <a id="l3086"></a>knew not what to follow but depended upon his <a id="l3087"></a>mouth as an Oracle: he was at liberty to set up <a id="l3088"></a>what religion he pleased amongst them &amp; after the religion  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p048v"> &lt;48v&gt; </span> he set up was once generally received among them it <a id="l3089"></a>became as difficult for any man to innovate as 'tis <a id="l3090"></a>now to innovate in the Greek &amp; Latin Churches. ffor <a id="l3091"></a>those few innovations which came in afterwards required <a id="l3092"></a>a long time to creep in &amp; met with opposition: but these <a id="l3093"></a>things were  received  at first without any opposi<a id="l3094"></a>tion of the party. </p>

<p id="par159">The first certain intelligence which we have of <a id="l3100"></a>these miracles is in the life of Antony,  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 61v &gt; </span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 61r resumes &gt; </span> &amp; the book <a id="l3106"></a>of Hilary  written at the same time against Constan<a id="l3107"></a>tius.

This Hilary wrote from the Diocese of Antioch <a id="l3116"></a>A.C. 360 ✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 61v &gt; </span>✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 61r resumes &gt; </span> So that miracles began  about the same time <a id="l3117"></a>to make a noise amongst the Monks of Egypt &amp; Syria.  But <a id="l3118"></a>it was Egypt which lead the dance. ffor  as the persecution of Maximianus  had afforded them the greatest plenty of martyrs so they  were not  <a id="l3119"></a>content with doing miracles at home but sent into all <a id="l3120"></a>the Empire the reliques of their Saints &amp; Martyrs to <a id="l3121"></a>inflame the whole Roman world with this kind of Superstition. <a id="l3122"></a> For thus Chrysostom <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n88-ref">[88]</sup>  in  an Oration had at Antioch while <a id="l3123"></a>Alexandria was the  first  seat of the East &amp; <a id="l3124"></a>by consequence before the  year 381  informs us in these <a id="l3125"></a>words. <em class="underline">Blessed be God</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">because Marytrs come out of <a id="l3126"></a>Egypt, out of that mad Egypt  which fought with God, &amp; <a id="l3127"></a> out of Egypt whence were impious mouths <a id="l3128"></a>&amp; blasphemous tongues are  Martyrs had; not in Egypt <a id="l3129"></a>only, not in the bordering &amp; neighbouring region, but every <a id="l3130"></a>where throughout the earth. And as in the greatest plenty <a id="l3131"></a>of corn &amp; provisions when the inhabitants of Cities see <a id="l3132"></a>they have greater store than suffices for their own <a id="l3133"></a>use they transmit it also to forreign cities; as well that <a id="l3134"></a>they may shew their civility &amp; liberality as that  besides <a id="l3135"></a>the abundance of these things they may mutually ac<a id="l3136"></a>quire from them what they want themselves: so also <a id="l3137"></a>the Egyptians have done as to the Champions of reli<a id="l3138"></a>gion. When they saw that by the blessing of God <a id="l3139"></a>they had great plenty amongst themselves, they did <a id="l3140"></a>not shut up the great gift of God within their own <a id="l3141"></a>city but poured out the treasures of their good things <a id="l3142"></a>into all the parts of the world: as well that they <a id="l3143"></a>might shew their love towards the brethren as that <a id="l3144"></a>they might affect the  common Lord of all with</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p062r"> &lt;62r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">honour &amp; get glory to their City amongst all men, <a id="l3145"></a>&amp; declare it to be the Metropolis of the whole <a id="l3146"></a>world. ffor if  occasions, which are frivolous &amp; of no value, &amp; bounties which <a id="l3147"></a>conduce only to this life,  could procure this honour <a id="l3148"></a>to many cities, is it  not just that that City should  be endowed with this prerogative of honour which bestows <a id="l3149"></a>not fading &amp; corruptible things, but men who <a id="l3150"></a>even after death afford security to the cities which fall <a id="l3151"></a>to their lot? ffor the bodies of those saints do fortify <a id="l3152"></a>our city more strongly than any adamantine  <a id="l3153"></a>&amp; inexpugnable wall &amp; like  high rocks prominent <a id="l3154"></a>on all sides do not only propell the force of  visible enemies  but also subvert &amp; dissipate the treacheries of <a id="l3155"></a>invisible Dæmons &amp; of all the frauds of the Devil, as <a id="l3156"></a>easily as a valiant man can subvert  &amp; prostrate <a id="l3157"></a>the plays of children. And other kind of devices <a id="l3158"></a>made by men as walls ditches, arms, armies, &amp; what<a id="l3159"></a>ever is invented for the security of the inhabitants <a id="l3160"></a>may be reppelled by enemies with more &amp; greater <a id="l3161"></a>engines &amp; devices: but when a city shall be fortified <a id="l3162"></a>by the bodies of the saints, althô the enemies should <a id="l3163"></a>spend an infinite summ of money they could not <a id="l3164"></a>oppose to the cities where the saints are, any device <a id="l3165"></a>of like importance. Nor is this possession, Beloved, <a id="l3166"></a>only profitable against the treacheries of men or against <a id="l3167"></a>the fallacies of Devils: but if the our common Lord <a id="l3168"></a>should be angry for the multitude of our sins, we <a id="l3169"></a>might by laying these bodies before him make him <a id="l3170"></a>propitious to the city</em>. Thus far Chrysostom    who neare the end of this <a id="l3171"></a>Oration  subjoyning: <em class="underline">Let us compose our life according <a id="l3172"></a>to their   tolerance &amp; patience, that by their pray<a id="l3173"></a>ers, after we go hence  we may see &amp; embrace <a id="l3174"></a>them &amp; be placed with them in heavenly taber<a id="l3175"></a>nacles</em>. So then Chrysostom  prefers Alexandria <a id="l3176"></a>to Antioch in point of miracle-working reliques &amp; <a id="l3177"></a>makes that City the  fountain from whence  this superstition over<a id="l3178"></a>flowed the whole world. And therefore since  <a id="l3179"></a>this sort of miracles began to make a great cry <a id="l3180"></a>about Antioch  in or before the year 360,  &amp; <a id="l3181"></a>Athanasius continued Bishop of Alexandria till the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n89-ref">[89]</sup>  year <a id="l3182"></a>372 we have reason to beleive that this supersti<a id="l3183"></a>tion began at Alexandria long before his death &amp; by con<a id="l3184"></a>sequence that he promoted it.  And if you compare <a id="l3185"></a>with the  life of Antony  you <a id="l3186"></a>will have reason to suspect that it was Athanasius that set <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p064r"> &lt;64r&gt; </span>on foot this humour of miracles. For <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> miracles which <a id="l3187"></a>he there teaches to do by  the signe of the cross &amp;  certain  wo<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>rds &amp;<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> forms of speech <a id="l3188"></a>are much of the same kind with those done by  reliques <a id="l3190"></a>&amp; consecrated things,  &amp; seems to have set on foot that cry <a id="l3193"></a>of  these miracles which followed  in <a id="l3194"></a>Syria upon the  publishing of this Life. Ierome <a id="l3195"></a>tells us<sup class="note" id="n90-ref">[90]</sup>  that Hilarion the founder of Monkery in <a id="l3196"></a>Syria soon after the death of Antony went into <a id="l3197"></a>Egypt  &amp; visited the place of his <a id="l3198"></a>death (invited perhaps by reading his life) &amp; that in the <a id="l3199"></a>last year of Constantius he consecrated oyle &amp; distri<a id="l3200"></a>buted it among the people to cure the biting of ser<a id="l3201"></a>pents &amp; other venemous beasts. Which shews that this <a id="l3202"></a>sort of miracles was then in use in Egypt.   <a id="l3203"></a>The next year when Iulian the  Apostate reigned, <a id="l3204"></a>the Gentiles  <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n92-ref">[92]</sup>  upon a signe given them by the Emperor de<a id="l3208"></a>molished the miracle working sepulchers. Whence Grego<a id="l3209"></a>ry Nazianzen in his first Oration against Iulian written in the <a id="l3210"></a>life time of that Emperor,  speaks  to him after this manner:  <em class="underline">Thou <a id="l3211"></a>hast not been afraid of the Martyrs to whom high ho<a id="l3212"></a>nours &amp; feasts are constituted; by whom Devils are dri<a id="l3213"></a>ven away &amp; diseases are cured; who  have appari<a id="l3214"></a>tions &amp; prædictions; whose bodies alone can do as much <a id="l3215"></a>as their holy souls whether they be handled or honoured <a id="l3216"></a>whose drops of blood alone &amp; the small signes of the <a id="l3217"></a> cross can do as much as their bodies. <a id="l3218"></a>These thou dost not worship but contemn &amp; despise</em>. <a id="l3219"></a> Amongst the miracle-working sepulchers was that <a id="l3220"></a>of Iohn the Baptist as Ierome in the epitaph of <a id="l3221"></a>Paula  thus mentions. <sup class="note" id="n93-ref">[93]</sup>  <em class="underline">Paula</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">saw Samaria: <a id="l3222"></a>There lay Eliseus &amp; Abdias &amp; Iohn the Baptist, where <a id="l3223"></a>she trembled being astonished at the many miracles. ffor <a id="l3224"></a>she saw the devils roare with various tortures &amp; <a id="l3225"></a> men before the sepulchers of the Saints howle like <a id="l3226"></a>wolves, bark like doggs, roar like lions, hiss like ser<a id="l3227"></a>pents, bellow like bulls; others swing their heads about <a id="l3228"></a>&amp; touch the ground backward with their crowns, &amp; weomen hang <a id="l3229"></a>by the feet without their garments falling over their face</em>. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p064v"> &lt;64v&gt; </span> comparing this passage with what we cited above out of Hilary <a id="l3230"></a>it should seem that  miracles were propagated out of Egypt first into Iudea where they began at these sepulchers,  <a id="l3231"></a>&amp; then into remoter provinces. When therefore Iulian gave the word, the Gentiles threw down the <a id="l3232"></a>sepulcher of Iohn the Baptist among the rest <sup> e</sup><sup class="note" id="n94-ref">[94]</sup>  &amp; scattered his <a id="l3233"></a>bones about.  But as they were gathering them up again  to burn <a id="l3234"></a>them,  some Monks coming from Ierusalem to pray there <a id="l3235"></a>mixt themselves with the  gentiles &amp;  stole away with some <a id="l3236"></a>of the bones &amp; gave them to  Philip the ffather of their <a id="l3237"></a>Monastery. But he thinking them too great a treasure for <a id="l3238"></a>himself sent them by his Deacon Iulian to Athanasius.  <a id="l3239"></a><em class="underline">who</em>, saith Ruffin, <sup class="note" id="n95-ref">[95]</sup>  <em class="underline">having received them,  shut them up before <a id="l3240"></a>a few witnesses  in the hollowed wall of a <a id="l3241"></a> Church to preserve them by a prophetic spirit for <a id="l3242"></a>the use &amp; benefit of posterity</em>. So then  Philip could <a id="l3243"></a>think of no fitter person then Athanasius to whom he should make a <a id="l3244"></a>present of these miracle-working reliques &amp; Athanasi<a id="l3245"></a>us  who no doubt had heard much of their virtues hid them that after the reign of Iulian <a id="l3246"></a> they might be  used again for the benefit of man<a id="l3248"></a>kind as before.  And this <a id="l3253"></a>compared with what you have heard out of Chrysos<a id="l3254"></a>tom gives us reason to  suspect that he was the <a id="l3255"></a>grand patron of this superstition &amp; to propagate it  sent reliques from Alexandria into all the world.</p>
<p id="par160">Now  by this great example  it soon came into fashion <a id="l3258"></a>for all  other cities to communicate their reliques <a id="l3259"></a>with one another.  So the reliques of the 40 Arme<a id="l3260"></a>nian Martyrs <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n96-ref">[96]</sup>  were dispersed &amp; sent into many regions <a id="l3261"></a> &amp; particularly to <a id="l3262"></a>Alexandria:  on which occasion Athanasius composed <a id="l3263"></a>an Oration on these Martyrs which Gerard Vossius saw <a id="l3264"></a>in Italy in the Library of Cardinal Ascanius as he <a id="l3265"></a>mentions in his commentary of the Oration of Ephrem <a id="l3266"></a>Syrus on the same 40 martyrs.

<p id="par161">Nor were the Athanasians of this age content <a id="l3269"></a>with dissecting &amp; distributing the bodies of  real martyrs, but <a id="l3270"></a>daily pretended to the discovery of new bodies by dreams <a id="l3271"></a>&amp; revelations (such as were the bodies of Gervasius &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p065r"> &lt;65r&gt; </span> Protasius found by S Ambrose &amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n97-ref">[97]</sup>  distributed amongst the Bishops <a id="l3272"></a>of Italy, France, Afric, Noricum the bones of the Prophets <a id="l3273"></a>Abacuc &amp; Micheas found by Zebennus bishop of Eleutheropolis, <a id="l3274"></a> the head of Iohn the Baptist found <a id="l3275"></a>by two Monks, the 40 Thracian martyrs found by the Em<a id="l3276"></a>press Pulcheria, the body of the Prophet Zachary found by <a id="l3277"></a>Calamer, the bodies of  the first martyr Stephen, &amp; <a id="l3278"></a>of Nicodemus &amp; others found by Lucian the Monk &amp; disperst <a id="l3279"></a> into all the Empire, &amp; innumerable others of less note. <a id="l3280"></a>the Monks  setting up altars in all places of the <a id="l3282"></a>fields &amp; high ways where such bodies were pretended to <a id="l3283"></a>be discovered &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n98-ref">[98]</sup>   going up &amp; down with reliques <a id="l3284"></a>from door to door <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n99-ref">[99]</sup>  to furnish every man.

<p id="par163">Now what a noise of miracles so great a number of  reliques  made  in the Empire  <a id="l3318"></a>may be learnt out of almost all the writers of that age <a id="l3319"></a>&amp; particularly out of the 2<sup>d</sup> Oration of Chrysostom con<a id="l3320"></a>cerning the martyr Babylas;  written at Antioch in the  <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n104-ref">[104]</sup>  year 382. ffor in this Oration speaking of <a id="l3324"></a>the Miracles of Christ &amp; his Apostles, he saith <em class="underline">All which <a id="l3325"></a>if any man affirm to be scarce  credible delusions, certainly those <a id="l3326"></a>things which are now beheld are more than enough to stop his <a id="l3327"></a>blasphemous mouth &amp; shame it &amp; check his unbridled <a id="l3328"></a>tongue. ffor there is no region nor people nor city <a id="l3329"></a>of this our world where these new &amp; surprising <a id="l3330"></a>miracles are not  the common discourse: which <a id="l3331"></a>if they were <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>fig<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ments they could not come into so great <a id="l3332"></a>an admiration of men</em>. And a little after. <em class="underline">The mi<a id="l3333"></a>racles which are daily done by the martyrs do sufficiently <a id="l3334"></a>confirm our discourse, a great multitude of people flocking <a id="l3335"></a>abundantly together to see them</em>. Well therefore did <a id="l3336"></a>Ambrose say that <sup class="note" id="n105-ref">[105]</sup> <em class="underline">the miracles of the Apostolic age were <a id="l3337"></a>now revived</em>. But that you may have some kind of <a id="l3338"></a>estimate of their prodigious number <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n106-ref">[106]</sup>  D.  Augustin <a id="l3339"></a>tells you that in his church at Hippo within the space of <a id="l3340"></a>less than two years there were delivered  in to be read to the people, almost seventy books <a id="l3341"></a>of the miracles done  in his Church at Hippo by  <a id="l3342"></a>a small parcel of the reliques of the first Martyr Stephen, <a id="l3343"></a>besides many other books which were  written but not then given <a id="l3344"></a>in.  And that at Calama a neighbouring City <a id="l3345"></a> where they began sooner to give <a id="l3346"></a>in  such books of miracles done by another parcel of S. <a id="l3347"></a>Stephens reliques the number of books was incredibly <a id="l3348"></a>greater.

<p id="par164">Now for what end Athanasius set on foot these <a id="l3351"></a>miracles is manifest from hence that they were  generally <a id="l3352"></a>practised &amp; promoted by  the Athanasians &amp; opposed <a id="l3353"></a>by their enemies.

<p id="par165">These &amp; such like stories sufficiently open the designe <a id="l3380"></a>of Athanasius &amp; his party in setting on foot this humour <a id="l3381"></a>of pretending to miracles. They found by experience that <a id="l3382"></a>their opinions were not to be propagated by disputing &amp; <a id="l3383"></a>arguing, &amp; therefore <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n111-ref">[111]</sup>  gave out that their adversaries <a id="l3384"></a>were crafty people &amp; cunning disputants &amp; their own <a id="l3385"></a>party simple well meaning men, &amp; therefore imposed <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n112-ref">[112]</sup>  this law <a id="l3386"></a>upon the Monks that they should not dispute about the <a id="l3387"></a>Trinity.

<p id="par166">That the way of writing  fals legends began in the <a id="l3392"></a> latter end of the reign of Constantius or soon after <a id="l3393"></a>is manifest by the fabulous lives of Antony, Paul, Hila<a id="l3394"></a>rion, Martin  Pachomius, Simeon &amp; many others writ by Athanasius, Ierom, Ruffin, Palladius Severus <a id="l3395"></a> Theodoret, &amp; other  authors whose writings of this kind are Collected  by  Rosweydus. <a id="l3396"></a>The life of Antony was translated into Latine by Evagrius <a id="l3397"></a>Bishop of Antioch &amp; by Ierome &amp;  soon dispersed all <a id="l3398"></a>over the world.  Hervetus first found &amp; published one of the latine translations A.C. 1555 &amp; at length <a id="l3399"></a>Iohn Meursius  found it in greek &amp; published it  A.C. 1616.  Hierome tells us<sup class="note" id="n113-ref">[113]</sup>  that Marcella learnt of the Presby<a id="l3400"></a>ters of Alexandria &amp; of Athanasius &amp; Peter at Rome the <a id="l3401"></a>life of Antony then living &amp; the discipline of the Monasteries <a id="l3402"></a>in Thebais. Whence Baronius  concludes that  the life of Antony was written by Athanasius before <a id="l3404"></a> they came to Rome. But this is a mistake. ffor Ierome does not <a id="l3405"></a>say that Marcella read the life of Antony or that others read it to her, but that <a id="l3406"></a>she learnt it of the Presbyters of Alexandria &amp; of <a id="l3407"></a>Athanasius &amp; Peter, that is  she learnt his manner of life by their <a id="l3408"></a>discourses.

He <a id="l3415"></a>wrote it therefore after the death of Antony &amp; before <a id="l3416"></a>the death of Constantius, that is, between the years 358 <a id="l3417"></a>&amp; 362.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 80r resumes &gt; </span> And this period concurring with the Councils <a id="l3418"></a>of  Sirmium Ariminum &amp; Seleucia, I conceive that in <a id="l3419"></a> the time of those  those Councils, or immediately after Athanasius finding him<a id="l3420"></a>self reduced to the utmost desperation &amp; seing no hopes <a id="l3421"></a>of recovery  unlesse by extraordinary practises, set <a id="l3422"></a>himself upon all kind of sophistry &amp; began with writing <a id="l3423"></a>this life. so that we may reccon it  written in the <a id="l3424"></a>year 358  or 359 the Monks of Syria requesting it soon after Antonies death.</p>
<p id="par167">Now this life is full of prodigious  stories such <a id="l3425"></a>as are the devil's appearing frequently to Antony in several shapes <a id="l3426"></a>&amp; bignesses &amp; talking with him &amp; afflicting him &amp; struggling with <a id="l3427"></a>him &amp; sometimes multitudes of devils appearing in various <a id="l3428"></a>shapes. Christ's appearing in the form of light to Antony <a id="l3429"></a>&amp; speaking to him. Antony's remaining as fresh &amp; plump <a id="l3430"></a>after long fasting as if he had not fasted, his curing <a id="l3431"></a>diseases, casting out devils, escaping Crocodiles by prayer, <a id="l3432"></a> frighting away devils &amp; curing demoniacks by the signe of the crosse, seing the soul <a id="l3433"></a>of Ammon ascend up to heaven,  being himself lifted up into the air, &amp; having revelations &amp; <a id="l3435"></a>by a spirit of prophesy foretelling things. These miracles <a id="l3436"></a>saith Athanasius were done by Antony by virtue of <a id="l3437"></a>the promise of Christ  that if we have faith like <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p081r"> &lt;81r&gt; </span>a grain of mustard seed we may remove mountains &amp; nothing <a id="l3438"></a>shall be impossible to us, &amp; that if we ask we shall receive. <a id="l3439"></a>Go, saith he, cure the sick, cast out devils, freely ye have received, <a id="l3440"></a>freely give.</p>
<p id="par168">This life – – – – – ‡<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 80v &gt; </span>‡ This Life is  allowed genuine by Baronius Bellarmin &amp; the <a id="l3441"></a>the Roman catholicks in general: nor do I hear it questioned by <a id="l3442"></a>any Protestants of note. But yet because I have met with one or <a id="l3443"></a>two who cannot beleive that so holy  a man as Atha<a id="l3444"></a>nasius would write such monstrous &amp; incredible  things as are in this life, &amp; therefore  were willing to suspect that the life now extant is the same <a id="l3446"></a>with that which Athanasius wrote I will  consider their arguments. <a id="l3447"></a>ffor they are such as if duly considered do rather make for it <a id="l3448"></a>&amp; prove it to be genuine.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 81r resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par169"> ffor first, say they, Antonius was learned whereas <a id="l3456"></a>this Life makes him ignorant of letters. I answer that tho antiquity magnified him yet he <a id="l3457"></a>was never celebrated for any other learning then what he <a id="l3458"></a>had without reading. None of the ancients affirm that he <a id="l3459"></a>could read but some  affirm the contrary. Socrates<sup class="note" id="n114-ref">[114]</sup>  <a id="l3461"></a>tells us that when a certain Philosopher asked Antony <a id="l3462"></a>how he could live being destitute of the solace of <a id="l3463"></a>books, Antony answered that his book was the nature of things: # <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 80v &gt; </span># Cassian<sup class="note" id="n115-ref">[115]</sup>  relates from the Monks of Egypt  the same thing with some varity of circumstance  spea<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ks <a id="l3466"></a>o<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>f two Philosophers who despised Antony as unskilful &amp;  void <a id="l3467"></a>of letters.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 81r resumes &gt; </span>  D. Austin<sup class="note" id="n116-ref">[116]</sup>   saith that it was the popular fame that <a id="l3468"></a>Antony without any knowledge of letters had the scriptures <a id="l3469"></a>by heart. And Sozomen that Antony neither knew letters nor <a id="l3470"></a>valued them but commended a good intellect as being older then l<a id="l3471"></a>etters &amp; the inventer of them.  Almost all which was taken out of the <a id="l3472"></a>life of Antony now extant. For there it is said that <a id="l3473"></a>Antony  <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n117-ref">[117]</sup>   would not learn letters    but yet was  so attentive to reading <a id="l3474"></a>that nothing of those things which were written slipt out of <a id="l3475"></a>his memory, but he retained all things, &amp; as for the rest me<a id="l3476"></a>ditation was to him instead of books. And <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n118-ref">[118]</sup>   when certain Philo<a id="l3477"></a>sophers thought to deride him for his ignorance of letters <a id="l3478"></a>he asked them which was oldest, the mind or letters &amp; which <a id="l3479"></a>was the cause of the other? to which when they replied that the <a id="l3480"></a>mind was older then letters &amp; the inventer of them, he <a id="l3481"></a>answered that he therefore who has a sound mind has no <a id="l3482"></a>need of letters. </p>
<p id="par170">Another objection is those præcepts of  <a id="l3483"></a>a monastick life which Gregory Nazianzen saith were written <a id="l3484"></a>by Athanasius in the life of Antony, are not found in the life <a id="l3485"></a>now extant. But this objection is lame on both leggs. ffor <a id="l3486"></a>Gregory s speaks of no precept. His words are that <em class="underline">Athanasius wrote  <a id="l3487"></a>Antony's life, as a law of monastick life, in the form <a id="l3488"></a>of a narration</em>. And this narration you have at large in the <a id="l3489"></a>Life  of Antony now extant, where Athanasius relates two <a id="l3490"></a>speeches of Antony to the Monks instructing them how upon all <a id="l3491"></a>occasions they should behave themselves: which speeches take <a id="l3492"></a>up one third part of this Life.</p>

<p id="par172"> Thirdly they object that the life of Antony now <a id="l3493"></a>extant wants all that <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>betwe<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>en Antony &amp; Paul.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p077r"> &lt;77r&gt; </span>  But if there <a id="l3495"></a>be any thing in this objection we must reject the Gospels: because some want what others have. <a id="l3496"></a>Athanasius  in the preface tells <a id="l3497"></a>us that he wrote but a small part of what Antony did: &amp; what therefore if he omitted the story of Paul? Or rather what <a id="l3498"></a> if the whole story of Paul be  <a id="l3499"></a>a Romance of a later date? Before Ierome wrote his <a id="l3500"></a>life the monks told such monstrous incredible stories of <a id="l3501"></a>him as Ierome himself was ashamed of, &amp; made him a <a id="l3502"></a>man hairy all over to the feet like a beast. Ierome  represents <a id="l3503"></a> that he was unknown to all the world till Antony found him <a id="l3504"></a> that  no man saw him but Antony &amp; that he found him by divine revelation &amp; by the direction of a Centaur &amp; of a <a id="l3505"></a>Satyr, which Satyr had a rational soul &amp; discoursed with <a id="l3506"></a>Antony in his own language &amp; beleived in Iesus Christ.  so <a id="l3507"></a>that before you can beleive that there was such a man <a id="l3508"></a>as Paul, you must beleive that Antony found him after <a id="l3509"></a>this miraculous manner. Well therefore did Ieromes contemporaries deride him, as <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n119-ref">[119]</sup>  he himself complains, for writing the life of a <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> who never <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span></p>
<p id="par173">In the last place they object that the life now extant conteins many fabulous <a id="l3510"></a> &amp; incredible things, which so pious &amp; judicious a <a id="l3511"></a>man as Athanasius would not write. But  I take it <a id="l3512"></a>to be rather an argument that Athanasius did write them <a id="l3513"></a>because they are of the same kind with other things <a id="l3514"></a>which Athanasius  then wrote. And if we will beleive <a id="l3515"></a>antiquity, Athanasius did really write them. For Socra<a id="l3516"></a>tes  affirms it in these words.<sup class="note" id="n120-ref">[120]</sup>   <em class="underline">What kind of man An<a id="l3517"></a>tony was in the wildernesse who openly contested with <a id="l3518"></a>Devils,  discovering all their craft &amp; treachery, &amp; how he <a id="l3519"></a>did many prodigies &amp; miracles is superfluous for me <a id="l3520"></a>to commemorate: for Athanasius Bishop of Alexandria <a id="l3521"></a>has handled that argument already, having written a <a id="l3522"></a>peculiar book concerning his life</em>. And Sozomen saith that <a id="l3523"></a><sup class="note" id="n121-ref">[121]</sup>  <em class="underline">Paulus simplex one of Antonies disciples was famous for <a id="l3524"></a>miracles, &amp; that for vexing &amp; driving away the Devil he was above even Antony himself</em>. ‡ And Ruffin &amp;c<sup class="note" id="n122-ref">[122]</sup>  <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 78v &gt; </span>‡ And Ruffin that Antony <em class="underline">living in the wilderness &amp; conversing only with Beasts <a id="l3525"></a>&amp;  having frequent triumphs over  Devils, he pleased God <a id="l3526"></a>above all mortals, &amp; left the Moncks notable examples of his insti<a id="l3527"></a>tution:  the telling of all which was prevented by that book which had <a id="l3528"></a>been written by Athanasius &amp; was published also in Latin</em>.

Austin<sup class="note" id="n124-ref">[124]</sup>  tells us <a id="l3537"></a>that when Pontitianus first acquainted him with the life <a id="l3538"></a>of Antony, he &amp; those with him <em class="underline">were astonished hearing the most strong<a id="l3539"></a>ly attested miracles done so lately in the Church</em>. <em class="underline">We all <a id="l3540"></a>wondred</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">both we because they were so great, <a id="l3541"></a>&amp; Pontianus because we had not heard of them before</em>. <a id="l3542"></a>He calls these miracles most strongly attested because <a id="l3543"></a>Athanasius  in  this life saith, he wrote them <a id="l3544"></a>according to the relations of the Moncks. <sup class="note" id="n125-ref">[125]</sup> One of the <a id="l3545"></a>most incredible stories in this life is that  Antony saw <a id="l3546"></a>the soul of Ammon, immediately after his death, carried <a id="l3547"></a>up into heaven by angels: &amp; Socrates<sup class="note" id="n126-ref">[126]</sup>  tells us expresly that this <a id="l3548"></a>story was told by Athanasius in the life of Antony. He tells <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p078r"> &lt;78r&gt; </span> also how Ammon was carried over the river Lycus by <a id="l3549"></a>Angels &amp; Palladius in the life of Ammon relating both <a id="l3550"></a>these stories tells us that Athanasius wrote them in the <a id="l3551"></a>life of Antony. Sozomen also tells them both almost <a id="l3552"></a>in the same words in which you may find them in the <a id="l3553"></a>life of Antony now extant, so that you may be <a id="l3554"></a>sure he had them from thence. He saith indeed that <a id="l3555"></a>these things were related by those who conversed familiarly <a id="l3556"></a>with Antony &amp; Ammon: but he means that they were <a id="l3557"></a>related by them not to himself who lived long after their <a id="l3558"></a>death, but to Athanasius who   in the Preface saith he wrote them by the relation of those men &amp; from whose book Sozomen <a id="l3560"></a>reported them.  Amongst the most incredible <a id="l3561"></a>parts of Antony's life may be also recconed his having <a id="l3562"></a> divine visions &amp;  foretelling things as <a id="l3563"></a>a Prophet. And yet Chrysostome assures us that Atha<a id="l3564"></a>nasius wrote such things.  His words are: <a id="l3565"></a><sup class="note" id="n127-ref">[127]</sup> <em class="underline">Antony was both worthy of the Vision of God &amp; <a id="l3566"></a>lead such a life as the laws of Christ require. <a id="l3567"></a>This any man will easily know who shall read that <a id="l3568"></a>book which conteins the history of his life: in which <a id="l3569"></a>also he shall see Prophesy shining forth. For he <a id="l3570"></a>prophesied manifestly of those whom the Arian pest <a id="l3571"></a>invaded; &amp; taught how great a  tempest &amp; confusion hung <a id="l3572"></a>over the churches from them; God revealing these <a id="l3573"></a>things &amp; setting all things in a figure before his eyes. <a id="l3574"></a> Which certainly is a principal  document <a id="l3575"></a>of the catholick faith,  seing none of the Hereticks <a id="l3576"></a>can be shewn to be such a man. But least you should <a id="l3577"></a>seem to heare these things from me, you shall rather <a id="l3578"></a>by reading the book learn all things accurately, that <a id="l3579"></a>you may thence  receive the greatest incite<a id="l3580"></a>ments to Philosophy. But I pray that we may not <a id="l3581"></a>only meditate on  the things written <a id="l3582"></a>therein, but also imitate what is there  <a id="l3583"></a>exprest</em>. Thus far Chrysostom, &amp;  what he here speaks of is in the life of Antony now extant. </p>
<p id="par174">So then Athanasius wrote such a life as that now <a id="l3585"></a>extant &amp; what he  wrote being found in this life  <a id="l3586"></a>we have no reason to doubt of its being genuine. <a id="l3587"></a> Tis certain that the way of <a id="l3589"></a>writing Ecclesiastical Romances did begin in that age &amp; <a id="l3590"></a>no man besides Athanasius had authority enough to break <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p066r"> &lt;66r&gt; </span> the ice in this way of writing. Antiquity tells us not of <a id="l3591"></a>any other life of Antony besides that written by Athanasius <a id="l3592"></a>&amp; this life now extant is an  entire piece written <a id="l3593"></a>in his stile. Sozomen tells us many things of Antony<sup class="note" id="n128-ref">[128]</sup>  <a id="l3594"></a>as that  he received letters from Constantine the great, lost his parents  in his youth,  distri<a id="l3595"></a>buted his fathers lands amongst his townsmen,  gave the rest <a id="l3596"></a>of his goods to the poor, converst with all wise men &amp; imitated <a id="l3597"></a>what was best in each, ate only bread &amp; salt &amp; drank only <a id="l3598"></a>water,  dined at sunset, often fasted two days or more, <a id="l3599"></a>often watched all night, slept on a matt &amp; frequently on the <a id="l3600"></a>bare ground, never annointed nor bathed himself nor saw him<a id="l3601"></a>self naked, was meek, prudent, pleasant foreknew things but  disswaded the monks from affecting it, spent his  time in working, <a id="l3602"></a>came often to  the cities to defend the  injured, interceded for them with the Presidents &amp; great men who  <a id="l3604"></a> delighted to see &amp; hear him, but immediately returned <a id="l3605"></a>to the wilderness saying that as fishes cannot live on dry land <a id="l3606"></a>so monks in cities lose their virtue: all which you may <a id="l3607"></a>find in the life of Antony now extant. So that I <a id="l3608"></a>cannot see the least reason to doubt of its being genuine <a id="l3609"></a>Bellarmin Baronius &amp; the rest of the Roman Church re<a id="l3610"></a>ceive it: &amp; 'tis nothing but a wrong notion of Athanasi<a id="l3611"></a>us which has made some of the Protestants doubt of it.</p>
<p id="par175">Now the consequences of this life were these.</p>
<p id="par176">ffirst it did set all the Monks upon an humour of of <a id="l3612"></a>pretending to miracles:  so that the whole world <a id="l3613"></a>presently rang with stories of this kind. And hence it came <a id="l3614"></a>to passe that the lives of  all the first  &amp; most <a id="l3615"></a>eminent Monks were filled with apparitions: of Devils, <a id="l3616"></a> miraculous cures of diseases, prophesies &amp; other prodigious <a id="l3617"></a>relations: as you may see in the Collection of Rosweydus. <a id="l3618"></a>And this was the original of those ecclesiastical Legends <a id="l3619"></a> which are still used in the Church of Rome <a id="l3620"></a></p>
<p id="par177">Secondly the superstitious or to speak more truly <a id="l3622"></a>the magical use of the signe of the Cross was hereby <a id="l3623"></a>set on foot &amp; propagated all over the East. In the <a id="l3624"></a>western Churches it was in use before. ffor they be<a id="l3625"></a>gan   in the time of Tertullian or before to be tainted with the <a id="l3626"></a>superstitions of the Montanists. Athanasius in his exile <a id="l3627"></a>learnt it there &amp;  now turning it into an inchantment makes Antony in a large discourse to the Monks teach them <a id="l3629"></a>how by this signe they may drive away the Devil <a id="l3630"></a>&amp; dissolve all kinds of  inchantments &amp; witch<a id="l3631"></a>craft. And this I like to be the original of the Greek &amp; Latine Church using it for this end.</p>
<p id="par178"> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p067r"> &lt;67r&gt; </span> Thirdly by writing this life Athanasius  obliged the <a id="l3632"></a>Monks &amp; fixt them to his interest. ffor he makes Antony <a id="l3633"></a>exhort y<sup>m</sup>  against  the religion of Constantius as Arian &amp; Antichristian &amp; prophesy <a id="l3634"></a>against it by divine inspiration predicting that it should overflow <a id="l3635"></a>the world.</p>
<p id="par179">Fourthly by this life Athanasius propagated Monkery &amp; <a id="l3636"></a>made it overflow the Roman world like a torrent. For Athanasius in <a id="l3637"></a>the end of this life commanded the Monks that they should read it <a id="l3638"></a>to their brethren that is to all Christians &amp; not only to them but <a id="l3639"></a>also to the heathens to convert them by means of the miracles related <a id="l3640"></a>therein. And thus this life going speedily into all  the Empire,  <a id="l3641"></a>struck its hearers with admiration &amp; made many desire to imitate <a id="l3642"></a>Antony. – – –<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p067Ar"> &lt;67Ar&gt; </span> &amp; made it overflow the Roman world like a torrent. <a id="l3643"></a>ffor this life going into all the Empire struck the homo<a id="l3644"></a>usians with admiration &amp; made many of them desire to <a id="l3645"></a>imitate Antony;  especially when they heard that the <a id="l3646"></a>guift of miracles continued  amongst  his successors.</p>
<p id="par180"> The Clergy also by this means soon became Monks. <a id="l3647"></a>ffor  besides that divers of them  became monks after they were clergy men it grew quickly into custome to elect  Deacons Presby<a id="l3648"></a>ters &amp; Bishops out of this order of men as the most holy, &amp; the <sup>p</sup><sup class="note" id="n129-ref">[129]</sup>  Emperors &amp; <sup>q</sup><sup class="note" id="n130-ref">[130]</sup>  Pope commanded that they should be elected  thence <a id="l3649"></a> : so that hence forward  the  <a id="l3650"></a> ffathers &amp; Bishops of the Church (Athanasius Basil, Gregory Nazianzen,  Gregory Nyssen, <a id="l3651"></a>Epiphanius Chrysostom, Hilary Eusebius Vercelensis Ambrose,  Ierome, Ruffin Austin Martin, &amp;c ) were <a id="l3652"></a>Monks &amp;  many of them (as Basil, Nazianzen, Eusebius Vercellensis, Ambrose Martin Augustin the founders of Monkery in Asia, Thrace, Italy, Lombardy, France, Afric) had monasteries out of which they <a id="l3653"></a>filled their Churches  And this was the original of the Cælibacy of the Priests  The habit of the <a id="l3654"></a>Monks was of a dark  russet or black colour; &amp; thence the Clergy <a id="l3655"></a>as many as were Monks wore black, which has been their <a id="l3656"></a>colour ever since. ffor the <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n132-ref">[132]</sup>  clergy before  wore <a id="l3657"></a>garments of any other colours  like the people. This body of men <a id="l3658"></a>was at first two  fold, Antony planting <a id="l3659"></a>one  body in Egypt  headed by <a id="l3660"></a>the Archbishop &amp; Clergy of Alexandria, &amp; Hilarion planting <a id="l3661"></a>another in Syria headed by the Archbishop &amp; Clergy of <a id="l3662"></a>Antioch. Both these bodies began to be numerous <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n133-ref">[133]</sup>  in the reign of Constantius &amp; from these two fountains Monkery  overflowed the world, but yet became not of a long <a id="l3664"></a>time so numerous in other regions as in these.</p>
<p id="par181"> </p>
<p id="par182">Now by propagating this order of men # <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 67r &gt; </span># Now by propagating this order of men Athanasius triumphed over all his enemies <a id="l3665"></a>as <sup>✝</sup><sup class="note" id="n134-ref">[134]</sup>  Sozomen tells you in these words. <em class="underline">That the opinion of Apollina<a id="l3666"></a>ris &amp; Eunomius prevailed not ….. is chiefly to be ascribed to the Monks. <a id="l3667"></a>For as many as followed the monastick  philosophy in Syria &amp; Cappadocia &amp; <a id="l3668"></a>the Provinces round about, did stifly adhere to the Nicene Decrees. <a id="l3669"></a>Certainly their heresies were embraced by almost all men throughout <a id="l3670"></a>all the Provinces of the East …. But that happened to them which had <a id="l3671"></a>before happened to the Arians. ffor the people  in those regions, while <a id="l3672"></a>they admired the monks exceedingly for their vertue &amp; works, thought <a id="l3673"></a>that they were of the right opinion &amp; avoyded those who  beleived other<a id="l3674"></a>wise as contaminated with adulterate opinions: after the manner that <a id="l3675"></a>the Egyptians formerly by following the doctrine of their Monks did <a id="l3676"></a>stoutly resist the Arians</em>. So then Monkery &amp; homousianism grew up <a id="l3677"></a>together: taking root first in Egypt &amp; soon after in Syria &amp; thence overspreading the <a id="l3678"></a>whole East. The greatest strength of Athanasius &amp; his predecessor Alexander <a id="l3679"></a>was  in Egypt: &amp; yet in the beginning was scarce greater there <a id="l3680"></a>then in other places, being every where almost none at all. ffor <a id="l3681"></a>in the beginning Alexander in <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n135-ref">[135]</sup>  a letter to his namesake of Byzantium <a id="l3682"></a>complained that <em class="underline">seditions &amp; persecutions were daily stirred up against <a id="l3683"></a>him</em>, &amp; that by means of the weomen he was summoned before the Iudges. And <a id="l3684"></a>at the same time when Hosius was sent by Constantine to compose the contro<a id="l3685"></a>versy, Arius wrote back to the Emperor that the multitude were on his <a id="l3686"></a>side &amp; the Emperor in  a satyrical letter written thereupon to all the Empire  again  makes mention  by way of concession. For he replies that he would therefore come &amp; make up the other party. His words are these. <em class="underline">The multitude</em> [saith  Arius] <em class="underline">is on our side. <a id="l3688"></a>Therefore I  a little one, will come neare that I may be a spectator <a id="l3689"></a>of mad warrs. I my self, I say, will come neare who am used to  quiet <a id="l3690"></a>the warres of mad men. Behold again</em> [he saith] <em class="underline">I come suppliant &amp; <a id="l3691"></a>being powerfull in arms I will not fight but being fortified with the faith <a id="l3692"></a>of Christ will cure you &amp; others</em> &amp;c. Thus Constantine makes Arius <a id="l3693"></a>speak &amp; a little after repeating Arius his boasting of the multitude,  subjoyns <a id="l3694"></a>that some of the Sibylls predicted it should be so in Libya:  &amp; after a recital of the <a id="l3695"></a>prophesy subjoyns. <em class="underline">What therefore, o thou most crafty man,  in what part of</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p067Av"> &lt;67Av&gt; </span> <em class="underline">the world dost thou confess thy self to be in?

Thus far Constantine a most unexceptionable witness. <a id="l3699"></a>And the same thing is   hinted by others of the most ancient <a id="l3700"></a>writers  as by Severus,<sup class="note" id="n136-ref">[136]</sup>  where speaking of  peace  from persecution restored to the Church by Constantine ; he saith, <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n137-ref">[137]</sup>  that <em class="underline">by that peace a far more  fearful danger <a id="l3703"></a>was begotten to all the Churches. For then the heresy of Arius brake forth</em> totumque <a id="l3704"></a>orbim invuto, errore turbaverat, <em class="underline">&amp; by bringing in error troubled the <a id="l3705"></a>whole world</em>, that is, in the  reign of Constantine. But Gregory Nazianen is <a id="l3706"></a> more plain <a id="l3707"></a><em class="underline">Arius</em>, saith he,  <em class="underline">beginning at the city of Alexandria,  &amp;  there <a id="l3708"></a>inventing his pestilent opinion, &amp; then like a flame in a feild <a id="l3709"></a>from a little spark</em> τὸ πολὺ της ὀικουμένης ἐπιδραμὼν <em class="underline">overrunn<a id="l3710"></a>ing a great part of the world, is opprest by our fathers &amp; that pi<span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span> <a id="l3711"></a>number  which then assembled at Nice  &amp; defined theology by certain <a id="l3712"></a>limits &amp; words</em>. In how large a sense τὸ πολὺ may be here taken <a id="l3713"></a>by Gregory  may be gathered from hence that <sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n138-ref">[138]</sup>  in another place he calls the same <a id="l3714"></a> men when in the reign of Constantius they <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l3715"></a> were the whole Christian world τὸ πολὺ της ἐκκλησίας  And  in how large a sense he did really take it, <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>is<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3717"></a>to be understood by a passage in <sup>k</sup><sup class="note" id="n139-ref">[139]</sup>  his 21<sup>th</sup> Oration; where when he <a id="l3718"></a>had told how Athanasius was made Bishop of Alexandria he thus goes <a id="l3719"></a>on. <em class="underline">Neither can I sufficiently tell whether he received thissacred dignity <a id="l3720"></a>as a reward of his vertue or as the fountain &amp; life of the Ch<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>urch.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3721"></a>For it was requisite that the Church languishing with the thirst of <a id="l3722"></a>truth,  should like Ismael be refreshed with drink, or like Helias <a id="l3723"></a>when the earth was dried for want of rain, be refreshed out of the <a id="l3724"></a>brook; &amp; breathing a little, be recalled to life &amp; left a seed to <a id="l3725"></a>Israel least we should become like Sodom &amp; Gomorra – – – – – – For this <a id="l3726"></a>reason, when we were cast down a horn of Salvation was raised <a id="l3727"></a>up to us &amp; a corner stone binding us to it self &amp; to one another <a id="l3728"></a>was opportunely cast in: – – – – – – Thus  &amp; for these rea<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>sons<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3729"></a>was he  by the voice of all the people <a id="l3730"></a> not according to the wicked manner which since obtains nor by sla<span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span><a id="l3731"></a>ters &amp; tyranny, but Apostolically &amp; spiritually, exalted to the throne <a id="l3732"></a>of Mark</em>. Thus far Gregory who as to the general state of the Ch<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>urch<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of that time could not be mistaken. ffor he was born before the <a id="l3733"></a>Council of Nice &amp; conversed much with his father  who was made Bishop of Nazianzum two years after that Council  &amp; continued 45 years in that Bishopric &amp; then died an hundred <a id="l3736"></a>years old.</p>
<p id="par183">But whereas Gregory saith that Athanasius was made Bishop <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>by<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3737"></a>the voice of all the people,   he seems in this particular to have <a id="l3738"></a>followed the letter of the Council of Alexandria  where Athanasius &amp; his  B<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ishops<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3739"></a>say that <em class="underline">all the multitude &amp; all the people of the catholick Chu<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>rch<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3740"></a></em> [that is all  whom they accounted catholick] coming <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p075v"> &lt;75v&gt; </span> <em class="underline">together as it were with one soul &amp; body, [] adjured us  for many days &amp; <a id="l3743"></a>nights together,  to make Athanasius Bishop whilst neither they departed from the Church <a id="l3744"></a>nor gave us leave to depart.</em>  So then the catholicks of  that very great &amp; very populous <a id="l3746"></a>city Alexandria which had in it twelve parishes were at that time not so many but that one Church <a id="l3747"></a> ( one of those little parochial Churches they built in the reign <a id="l3748"></a>of Licinius) was big enough to hold them all &amp; afford them room  <a id="l3749"></a>to eat &amp; drink &amp; sleep for many days together. You have heard above</p>

<p id="par184">  out of Eusebius <a id="l3757"></a>&amp;  Socrates that the Egyptians were now  in furious &amp; implacable  heats about the word homousios. Eusebius tells us that <a id="l3759"></a>the Emperor Constantine to quiet these heats called both parties <a id="l3760"></a>before him, forbare all anger, gave them good words as fathers &amp; Prophets,  honoured them with gifts &amp;  ratified the Nicene decree exhorting <a id="l3762"></a>them to peace.

<p id="par186">Some are of opinion that the Monks of this age <a id="l3770"></a>were most holy men: but this is a great prejudice <a id="l3771"></a>&amp; such a prejudice as judicious men who have read <a id="l3772"></a>&amp; considered  their lives can scarce fall into. ffor <a id="l3773"></a>they seeme to me to have been the most unchast <a id="l3774"></a>&amp; superstitious part of mankind as well in this <a id="l3775"></a>first age as in all following ages. For it was a gene<a id="l3776"></a>ral  notion amongst them <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n141-ref">[141]</sup>  that after any man became <a id="l3781"></a>a Monk he found himself more tempted by the Devil <a id="l3782"></a>to lust then before &amp; those who went furthest into the <a id="l3783"></a>wilderness &amp; profest Monkery most stricktly were <a id="l3784"></a>most tempted, the Devil (as they imagined) tempting them most when it was to divert them from the best purpose.

It does not only render the body feeble &amp; <a id="l3797"></a>unfit for use but also enflames it &amp; invigorates lustful thoughts.  The want of sleep &amp; due refreshment  disorders the imagination &amp; at length brings men to a sort of <a id="l3799"></a>distraction &amp; madnesse so as to make them  have visions of <a id="l3800"></a>weomen conversing with 'em  <a id="l3801"></a>&amp; think they really see &amp; touch them &amp; heare them talk. ✝ ✝See the backside of the next page <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 76v &gt; </span>See the leaf before. ✝ as I gather from what the Monks have recorded from their own expe<a id="l3802"></a>rience.  <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span>anus in Collat. 22 <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span>. 2  propounds this Question <em class="underline">Cur interdum remissius jejunan<a id="l3803"></a>tes levioribus carnis <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span>culeis titillentur &amp; nonnunquam districtius abstinentes <a id="l3804"></a>afflicto exhaustoque corpore incentivis acr<span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to manuscript damage">{illeg}</span>ribus urgeantur ita ut experge fac<a id="l3805"></a>ti reperiant se humorum naturalium <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>qu<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>estione respersos</em>.

<p id="par187">Then for superstition they were eminent. ffor  what else is their placing so much of religion <a id="l3826"></a>in bodily exercises;  as in extravagant fasting; in torturing <a id="l3827"></a>their bodies by irons, ulcers, sordid habitations &amp; the like, in <a id="l3828"></a>standing daily upon a pillar or in some other strange <a id="l3829"></a>posture to be seen of men; in using the signe of the <a id="l3830"></a>cross,  dead mens bones, holy  water, consecrated oyle &amp; other consecrated things to do super<a id="l3831"></a>natural operations;  &amp; in praying by number. ffor  <a id="l3833"></a>in the life time of Antony Pachomius one of his <a id="l3834"></a>disciples founding many monasteries  (for <a id="l3835"></a>he was the first founder of monastical societies) instituted that <a id="l3836"></a>they should say 12 prayers in the morning, 12 at noon &amp; <a id="l3837"></a>12 at night &amp; 3 at nine at nine a clock &amp; pretended he did it by the direction of an Angel which conversed with him, &amp; dictated the laws which he prescribed to his monasteries. Others <a id="l3838"></a>said a greater number.  And that they <a id="l3839"></a>measured  holinesse by the number  is mani<a id="l3840"></a>fest by  a story which Palladius tells of Paul the Abbot.<sup class="note" id="n143-ref">[143]</sup>  <em class="underline">It <a id="l3841"></a>was this man's exercise</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">to pray continually. He <a id="l3842"></a>had 300 prayers exprest &amp; so many stones in his bosom <a id="l3843"></a>&amp; at every prayer cast away a stone. When he came <a id="l3844"></a>to Macarius he said, Abbot Macarius I am very much <a id="l3845"></a>afflicted. In a certain village there lives  a certain maid <a id="l3846"></a> which saith 700 prayers. When I had learnt this I blamed <a id="l3847"></a>myself because I could say but 300. To which Macarius <a id="l3848"></a>answered: Tis now  sixty years that I have said an <a id="l3849"></a>hundred set prayers &amp; yet I do not judge my self <a id="l3850"></a>negligent</em>.  For Macarius was he whom  <sup>r</sup><sup class="note" id="n144-ref">[144]</sup>  Antony  left heir of his spirit &amp; virtues as Elija did Elisha: <sup>s</sup><sup class="note" id="n145-ref">[145]</sup>  for Antony himself numbred his prayers. Here you have the original of the Popish <a id="l3851"></a>custome of praying by beads: &amp; if you desire the original <a id="l3852"></a>of praying  without understanding or (which is all <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p076r"> &lt;76r&gt; </span> one) in an unknown tongue, Cassian  tells you in these words. <a id="l3853"></a><sup class="note" id="n146-ref">[146]</sup> <em class="underline">Antonij hæc erat cælestis &amp; plusquam humana sententia.

<p id="par188"> They had also the doctrine of Purgatory as I gather from the story  which Ruffin tells of Macarius <span class="hspac-n" title="6 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> the disciple of Antony<sup class="note" id="n147-ref">[147]</sup>  namely that <a id="l3876"></a>in going  over the sands of Egypt he found a <a id="l3877"></a>dead mans skull &amp; upon asking it questions the <a id="l3878"></a>skull answered that he was in hell &amp;  that the damned found some ease <a id="l3879"></a>by the prayers of the  Church. This is a step <a id="l3880"></a>beyond Purgatory.</p>
<p id="par189">The first monks  also taught blind obedience to superiors <a id="l3881"></a> <a id="l3883"></a>For it was <sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n149-ref">[149]</sup>  a saying of Antony to such  as came to <a id="l3884"></a>be admitted his disciples: <em class="underline">You may be saved if you <a id="l3885"></a>have obedience &amp; do whatever I bid you</em>.

<p id="par193">Victor in his History of the Vandalick Persecution <a id="l3899"></a>tells us that Hunneric king of the Vandals began it in <a id="l3900"></a>this manner. ffirst he commanded the sacred Virgins or <a id="l3901"></a>Nuns to be assembled &amp; searched by midwives &amp; then <a id="l3902"></a>hung up with weights at their feet &amp; tortured with <a id="l3903"></a>heated plates of iron aplied to several parts of <a id="l3904"></a>their bodies, saying: Confesse to us how your Bishops <a id="l3905"></a>&amp; Priests lye with you?

<h2 id="hd34" class="cent">Quest <a id="l3930"></a><br>Whether the Emperor Valens persecuted the Athanasians <a id="l3931"></a>for religion or only punished them for their  immoralities.</h2>
<p id="par194">After  Constantius reigned Iulian the Apostate two <a id="l3932"></a>years &amp; then the Empire became divided between Valenti<a id="l3933"></a>nian &amp; Valens.  Now Valens who reigned in the East  is <a id="l3934"></a>recconned a very great Persecutor: And yet if you except <a id="l3935"></a>such as were   sentenced as criminals or perished in seditions  <a id="l3936"></a>you will scarce meet with either martyrs or confessors <a id="l3937"></a>in his reign.  The Ecclesiastical historians tell us indeed that he caused eighty <a id="l3938"></a>Presbyters to be burnt together in a ship at sea.  &amp; to make it the more <a id="l3941"></a>probable the names of some of the Presbyters are added. And <a id="l3942"></a>this is the great act of cruelty for which he is so much <a id="l3943"></a>exclaimed against as a Persecutor. But what if this story <a id="l3944"></a>be a fable? ffor the Historians wrote not till fifty years <a id="l3945"></a>after the death of  Valens, &amp; Greg. Nazianzen who <a id="l3946"></a> flourished in his reign <a id="l3947"></a>tells us there was but one Presbyter burnt. ffor thô in <a id="l3948"></a>an oratorical flourish he speaks <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n151-ref">[151]</sup>  somewhere in the plural <a id="l3949"></a>number of dead mens hands cut off &amp; Presbyters burnt  yet as he  meant  but one hand cut off in his 23<sup>d</sup> Oration <a id="l3950"></a>where he tells the story of the  ship  distinctly he saith:  Ναυς <a id="l3951"></a>φόρτον ἔχουσα των πρεσβυτέρων ἕνα, καὶ τουτον ὀυδὲ <a id="l3952"></a>ὕπερ κακου τινος, ἀλλ᾽ ὕπερ πίστε<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>αις<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> κινδυνεύοντα, κατα <a id="l3953"></a>πελάγους ἀφιήται – – – – – ἀνάπτεται τὸ πυρ, δαπαναται <a id="l3954"></a>ἡ ναυς συνδαπαναται ὁ φόρτος, πυρ ὕδατι μίγνυται – – – – <a id="l3955"></a>καὶ ὁ πρεσβύτερος κόνις &amp;c. <em class="underline">A ship was put to sea with <a id="l3956"></a>one Presbyter in it to be burnt there, not for any wicked<a id="l3957"></a>ness but for his faith, &amp;  this Presbyter being a <a id="l3958"></a>pious man took it chearfully. Whilst the ship set to sail, <a id="l3959"></a>a multitude of spectators stood on the shore some rejoycing <a id="l3960"></a>others lamenting &amp; then the ship was set on fire &amp; con<a id="l3961"></a>sumed with the Presbyter. And</em>, saith Gregory, <em class="underline">I have many <a id="l3962"></a>witnesses of this story: for the tragedy of this punishment <a id="l3963"></a>is come to the ears of many</em>. So then the first rumor <a id="l3964"></a>spread abroad  in Asia minor <a id="l3965"></a>where Gregory Nazianzen lived &amp; where the thing was <a id="l3966"></a>said to be done, was of but one Presbyter. This Gregory wrote presently after the reign of Valens as the chief instance of the persecutions of that reign which he could think of. And whilst <a id="l3967"></a>I consider how improbable it is that the Emperor should <a id="l3968"></a>destroy a ship so foolishly: I cannot beleive there was <a id="l3969"></a>one. The story looks as if framed by somebody who <a id="l3970"></a>not daring to lay the scene of the execution in any town  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p049v"> &lt;49v&gt; </span> where he might have been confuted by the inhabitants <a id="l3971"></a> contrived it at sea &amp; pretended  several spectators <a id="l3972"></a> on shore to confirm it. ffor one man or <a id="l3973"></a>two  might as easily send <a id="l3974"></a>abroad the story at first as others could afterwards mend <a id="l3975"></a>it &amp;  enlarge the number of martyrs from one to fourscore. <a id="l3976"></a>So then to make Valens go for a Persecutor there has <a id="l3977"></a>been such art &amp; contrivance as would have been unne<a id="l3978"></a>cessary had he been a persecutor in good earnest.</p>

<p id="par196">But that you may know what kind of persecutor he <a id="l3987"></a>was, the first &amp; so far as I can find the greatest act of <a id="l3988"></a> his persecution (if you set aside what happened upon <a id="l3989"></a>seditions) was an edict that all those  who were <a id="l3990"></a>banished by Constantius &amp; released by Iulian the Apostate <a id="l3991"></a>should return to banishment. And what sort of persecution <a id="l3992"></a>followed is  discovered by S. Basil in his 220<sup>th</sup> Epistle in these <a id="l3993"></a>words. Ἡ ἀνατολὴ πασα σχηδὸν &amp;c  <em class="underline">Almost all the east, most <a id="l3994"></a>reverend father, that is all  regions from Illyricum to Egypt, <a id="l3995"></a>is lost with a vehement tempest by the heresy long since spread <a id="l3996"></a>by Arius the  enemy of truth, &amp;  now impudently <a id="l3997"></a>shewing it self again, &amp; as from a bitter root bringing <a id="l3998"></a>forth deadly fruit, &amp; prevailing now because throughout all <a id="l3999"></a>the Diocesses, the patrons of orthodoxy ἐκ συκοφαντίας, καὶ</em> <a id="l4000"></a> ἐπηρείας των ἐκκλησιων ἐκπεσειν <em class="underline">by false accusa<a id="l4001"></a>tions &amp; injurious reproaches are</em> <a id="l4002"></a><em class="underline"> deposed from the Churches</em>. He means that they were <a id="l4003"></a>deposed not in all the diocesses, but in those few where they <a id="l4004"></a>were. And to the same purpose Gregory Nazianzen  <a id="l4005"></a>in his 32<sup>d</sup> Oration<sup class="note" id="n152-ref">[152]</sup>  had before the Bishops of the second general Council,  after he had mentioned the persecution of Iulian <a id="l4007"></a>speaks thus of Valens. <em class="underline">The second was no whit more humane <a id="l4008"></a>then  him, or rather he was more grievous because <a id="l4009"></a>whilst he bare the name of Christ he was a  false <a id="l4010"></a>Christ &amp; the disgrace of Christians: to whome it was made impious to act <a id="l4011"></a>&amp; inglorious to suffer, because they did not seem to receive an</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p050r"> &lt;50r&gt; </span><em class="underline">injury nor was their  martyrdome accompanied with a glorious name, <a id="l4012"></a>but even here the truth was disguised, so that they who suffered as <a id="l4013"></a>Christians were recconed to be punished as impious persons</em>.</p>
<p id="par197">So again in his Oration  in laudem Heronis<sup class="note" id="n153-ref">[153]</sup>  he <a id="l4014"></a>saith that <em class="underline">the persecution of Valens was in this respect more sharp <a id="l4015"></a>then that of Iulian, because the conflict of the Martyrs was then <a id="l4016"></a> apparent &amp; illustrius but now to suffer was inglorious at least <a id="l4017"></a>before the unjust judges by whom they were condemned to suffer</em>. <a id="l4018"></a> So then what Valens did whether in <a id="l4019"></a>punishing seditious persons by temporal Iudges or deposing <a id="l4020"></a>Clergy men by spiritual ones, was not looked upon  by the people during his reign as a <a id="l4022"></a> persecution, but those that suffered were thought to suffer justly. <a id="l4023"></a> For  Basil also<sup class="note" id="n154-ref">[154]</sup>  in his  Epistle to the Churches of <a id="l4032"></a>Gallia &amp; Italia writes to the same purpose. <em class="underline">A persecution <a id="l4033"></a>lays hold of us, most reverend brethren</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">the most <a id="l4034"></a>grievous of all persecutions. For the sheepherds are driven <a id="l4035"></a>away that the flocks may be dispersed. And which is the most <a id="l4036"></a>grievous, neither they which suffer  bear their sufferings <a id="l4037"></a>patiently to the accomplishing of martyrdome neither does the <a id="l4038"></a>people  honour those as martyrs who suffer; by <a id="l4039"></a>reason that the persecutors are covered over with the name <a id="l4040"></a>of Christians</em>. So then torturing imprisoning killing &amp; burning <a id="l4041"></a>for mere religion was not then in fashion: for such suffer<a id="l4042"></a>ings would have moved pity in the people. And tho they tell <a id="l4043"></a>us they were persecuted for religion &amp; Basil in this very <a id="l4044"></a>Epistle  writes to the same purpose yet he means that religion was the secret cause for which <a id="l4046"></a>they  suffered  under other open pretenses. <a id="l4047"></a>For he writes thus.  <em class="underline">There is one crime now vehemently <a id="l4048"></a>punished, that is an accurate adhering to the traditions of the ffathers. <a id="l4049"></a>For this thing the pious are driven from their fathers seats <a id="l4050"></a>&amp;  translated into solitudes. With the unjust judges there is <a id="l4051"></a>no veneration of the hoary head, none of the exercise <a id="l4052"></a>of piety, none of conversation regulated according to the <a id="l4053"></a>gospel  all the life: but whilst no  <a id="l4054"></a>malefactor  is condemned without good evidence, the Bish<a id="l4055"></a>ops are condemned by  calumny alone, &amp; without <a id="l4056"></a>any proof of the accusations are delivered over to</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p051r"> &lt;51r&gt; </span><em class="underline">punishment. And some neither knew their accusers nor saw <a id="l4057"></a>the judgment seats, nor were first accused, but were taken <a id="l4058"></a>by force in the night time &amp; sent into banishment, being by the <a id="l4059"></a>calamities of the  deserts delivered to death. And what <a id="l4060"></a> followed these things all men know thô we <a id="l4061"></a>should be silent, namely the  flight of Priests &amp; Dea<a id="l4062"></a>cons &amp; depredations of the whole clergy</em>. Here you see <a id="l4063"></a>Basil gives the western Bishops a full description of <a id="l4064"></a>the eastern persecution. Some Bishops, saith he, were <a id="l4065"></a>banished upon fals accusations, others  carried away by force <a id="l4066"></a>in the night &amp; banished without any trial: that is in cities <a id="l4067"></a>where the people were tumultuous &amp; would not suffer <a id="l4068"></a>their Bishops to be brought to trial. In these the Presi<a id="l4069"></a>dents  were necessitated to seize the Bishops in the night <a id="l4070"></a>when the people were asleep &amp; afterwards  to disperse <a id="l4071"></a>their clergy before they could compose the cities &amp; place <a id="l4072"></a>new bishops there.   So you <a id="l4078"></a>see it was now grown in fashion to abet seditions &amp; celebrate those for <a id="l4079"></a>martyrs &amp; confessors who   suffered for them. <a id="l4081"></a>Athanasius &amp; others did it in the reign of Constantius &amp; there<a id="l4082"></a>fore you need not wonder if Basil did it now. ffor <a id="l4083"></a>in his Epistle to the Alexandrians<sup class="note" id="n155-ref">[155]</sup>  he abets &amp; sanctifies all their <a id="l4084"></a>seditions by the  name of persecution  <a id="l4085"></a> on the Emperors side &amp; martyrdome on theirs. And as Atha<a id="l4086"></a>nasius had before stirred up the Western Emperor <a id="l4087"></a>against the Eastern so Basil  now together <a id="l4088"></a>with other  Eastern Bishops of his party sent several embassies <a id="l4089"></a>into the west to sollicite the western Bishops to their <a id="l4090"></a>releife, that is, to sollicit them to  stirr up the western <a id="l4091"></a>Emperor Valentinian against his brother Valens. <a id="l4092"></a>[ffor Basil <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n156-ref">[156]</sup>  with  Meletius Bishop of Antioch &amp;  their friends in the <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n157-ref">[157]</sup>  Epistle  to the Bishops of Gallia <a id="l4093"></a>&amp; Italy newly mentioned (which was sent by Dorotheus one of  those Eastern Bishops in the name of the rest,)  saith: <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 50v &gt; </span> For the eastern Bishops Meletius of Antioch, Eusebius, Basilius &amp; the <a id="l4096"></a>rest of Syria &amp; Asia who held the Consubstantiality sending a common Embassy  on this errand to the <a id="l4097"></a>Bishops of Italy &amp; Gallia: Basil in the  Epistle which he then wrote <a id="l4098"></a> to the same western Bishops (that Epistle which we <a id="l4099"></a>newly mentioned) saith  in the name of them all: <a id="l4100"></a>We desire chiefly – – – –<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 51r resumes &gt; </span> <em class="underline">We desire chiefly that our  <a id="l4101"></a>troubles &amp; confusion may be made known by your <a id="l4102"></a>piety to the Emperor of your regions</em>.

<p id="par198" class="i0">This was in the year 378, three years before the second general Council.</p>
<p id="par199">So then before this year the Deity of the Holy Ghost <a id="l4124"></a>was rarely preached in the east for fear of the people. <a id="l4125"></a>Basil himself  was so fearful of doing it that his <a id="l4126"></a>faith was for a good while suspected by those of his own <a id="l4127"></a>party. And when he began to use the new Doxology, tho <a id="l4128"></a>he did not presently reject the old one but  for <a id="l4129"></a>a blind used that &amp; the new one promiscuously,  some <a id="l4130"></a>of the people then present (as <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n159-ref">[159]</sup>  he tells us rushed upon him saying that he used <a id="l4131"></a>new &amp; strange words &amp;  also such as were con<a id="l4132"></a>trary to one another. This put Basil upon writing <a id="l4133"></a>his book de Spiritu Sancto  for he wrot it in Defense of the new Doxology. Yet he opposes not the <a id="l4135"></a>old doxology but grants it was then generally in use <a id="l4136"></a>&amp; not only then but  in the former ages. All that he <a id="l4137"></a>contends for is that the new doxology may be used &amp; was <a id="l4138"></a>sometimes used by the Fathers tho so sparingly that he accounts it paradoxical to meet with it in them Yet he thought t<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>hey<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> sometimes mi<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ght<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> use it: &amp; in his 29<sup>th</sup> chapter <a id="l4139"></a>produces out of antiquity whatever he could meet with to <a id="l4140"></a>this purpose . But   his citations  as they <a id="l4141"></a>are but few so they  seem <a id="l4142"></a>frivolous that only of Dionysius &amp; another of Apricanus the Chronologer excepted. For they are these. <em class="underline">Clemens</em> <a id="l4143"></a>Romanus saith, <em class="underline">God lives &amp; the Lord Iesus Christ &amp; the Holy</em> <a id="l4144"></a>Ghost Irenaeus calls the <em class="underline">spirit</em> Θειον <em class="underline">divine</em>, Eusebius of Cæsarea hath these words: <em class="underline">Invoking</em> <em class="underline">with the holy Spirit</em> [that is through his assistance] <em class="underline">God the <a id="l4145"></a>author of light through our Saviour Iesus Christ. </em> Origen in his exposition on the Psalmes some<a id="l4147"></a>times <em class="underline">gives glory with the Holy Ghost</em>, that is, in him, or by his assistence. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p069r"> &lt;69r&gt; </span> &amp; in the sixt book of his exposition on Iohn pronounces <em class="underline">the  Trinity to be adored</em>, &amp; in his commentary on the Romans he saith <em class="underline">The <a id="l4149"></a>holy vertues are capable of the only begotten &amp; of the Deity of the <a id="l4150"></a>Holy ghost</em>. But Basil here subjoyns that Origen in these last citations <a id="l4151"></a>contradicts his own opinion: which is as much as to say, that his <a id="l4152"></a>books had been here corrupted. For Origen was no such <a id="l4153"></a>tatter-brains as to contradict himself in the first principles of <a id="l4154"></a>Christianity. ✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 68v &gt; </span>✝ Basil further alleges that  the Neocæsarienses used the new <a id="l4155"></a>Doxology &amp;  because they were tenacious of the traditions of <a id="l4156"></a>Gregorius Thaumaturgus, he thence infers that they had it from this <a id="l4157"></a>Gregory &amp; used it ever since his time. But this is a sophism of Basils. <a id="l4158"></a>ffor Basil  in his 64<sup>th</sup> Epistle to the Doctors of Neocæsarea <a id="l4159"></a>tells us that the Neocæsarienses were then lapst into Sabellianism <a id="l4160"></a>teaching one hypostasis of the  ffather Son &amp; Holy Ghost &amp; pleading that <a id="l4161"></a>Gregory in his Creed had said πατέρα καὶ  υἱὸν ἐπινοία μὲν ἐινα <a id="l4162"></a>δυὸ, ὑποστάσει δὲ ἕν, that the father &amp; Son were two in the mode of <a id="l4163"></a>conception, &amp; but one in hypostasis: whereas saith he the heresy of Sa<a id="l4164"></a>bellius was laid asleep by the tradition of this Gregory &amp; in his writing <a id="l4165"></a>were to be found many words which added strength even to the contrary <a id="l4166"></a>heresy now reigning as τὸ κτίσμα καὶ τὸ ποίημα καὶ ἔι τι τοιουτη <a id="l4167"></a>a creature &amp;  a facture &amp; if there be any thing <a id="l4168"></a>else of that kind. The Neocæsarienses therefore had this new doxology not <a id="l4169"></a>from Gregory but from the Sardican Sabellianism,  <a id="l4170"></a>from whence also the western Churches derived it. Now these alle<a id="l4171"></a>gations are all<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 69r resumes &gt; </span> These  citations are all that Basil could find in the Fathers for <a id="l4172"></a>the Deity &amp; worship of the Holy Ghost which being either frivolous or spurious incline me vehemently to <a id="l4173"></a>suspect that the fathers were absolute strangers to the new doxo<a id="l4174"></a>logy.  And therefore he that made Dionysius use it &amp;  pleade the authority of antiquity for  that use, seems to have <a id="l4176"></a>misrepresented antiquity that by their feigned authority he might <a id="l4177"></a>perswade his credulous followers to receive it.</p>
<p id="par200">In a word the  doxology ascribed to Dionysius together with what preceded <a id="l4178"></a>in the body of his apology is so inconsistent  as well with the other writings of Dio<a id="l4179"></a>nysius  as with the language of his age  &amp; looks so like <a id="l4183"></a>the artifice of Athanasius that I must accuse him &amp; desire <a id="l4184"></a>his friends to  lay aside their Athanasius dixit &amp; clear him by fair evidence.</p>

<h2 id="hd35" class="cent">Whether Athanasius for stifling objections <a id="l4185"></a>taken from the writings of Dionysius of Alexandria <a id="l4186"></a>&amp; from the Council of Antioch collected against Paul of <a id="l4187"></a>Samosat &amp; for changing the ancient Doxology did <a id="l4188"></a>not feign records.</h2>
<p id="par201">② About 10 years after this The Council of Antioch consisting of 70 Bishops or according to Hilary of 80) collected out of almost all the East <a id="l4189"></a>against Paul of Samosat  in condemning this <a id="l4191"></a>Heretick decreed that the son was not homousios to the father. <a id="l4192"></a>This is expresly acknowledged by <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n160-ref">[160]</sup>  Athanasius <sup class="note" id="n161-ref">[161]</sup> Hilary &amp; <sup class="note" id="n162-ref">[162]</sup> Basil &amp; denyed <a id="l4193"></a>by no body. And this decree was then universally received in <a id="l4194"></a>the Churches the Council sending about their sentence with <a id="l4195"></a>circulatory letters to the Bishops of Rome &amp; Alexandria <a id="l4196"></a>&amp; other Metropolitans to be communicated to the rest of <a id="l4197"></a>the Bishops, &amp; all the Churches acquiescing in it without <a id="l4198"></a>any dispute then raised. Nor was this Council generally <a id="l4199"></a>received in that age only but hath ever since by all the <a id="l4200"></a>Churches of all ages been acknowledged orthodox, Athanasius <a id="l4201"></a>himself not daring to oppose it but chusing rather by <a id="l4202"></a>shams to decline &amp; silence the force of its authority. So <a id="l4203"></a>that of all the Councils which have been ever since  this has the best right to the title of an orthodox &amp; ecumeni<a id="l4205"></a>cal Council.</p>
<p id="par202">①  Dionysius <a id="l4206"></a>of Alexandria (as <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n163-ref">[163]</sup>  Athanasius informs us), hearing that <a id="l4207"></a>some bishops of Pentapolis much propagated the opinion <a id="l4208"></a>of Sabellius in those parts: wrote against them an Epistle <a id="l4209"></a>to Ammon &amp; Euphranor; in which he affirmed, <em class="underline">that the Son of <a id="l4210"></a>God was a thing made &amp; formed &amp; not the Father's pro<a id="l4211"></a>per son by nature but alien from him according to essence, <a id="l4212"></a>as a vine is from the nature of the Husbandman &amp; a <a id="l4213"></a>ship from that of the workmen: for being a thing made <a id="l4214"></a>he was not before he was made</em>. For that Dionysius wrote this is acknowledged by Athanasius.</p>
<p id="par203">About 55 years after this Council was the Council <a id="l4215"></a>of Nice  which within the space of one day, the  Emperor <a id="l4216"></a>being present &amp; pressing the homousios, debated &amp;  <a id="l4217"></a>through his importunity decreed it, but afterwards under<a id="l4218"></a>standing that by their over hasty decree they had dissolved <a id="l4219"></a>the decree of the Council of Antioch, they began to repent <a id="l4220"></a>of what they had done &amp; complained that the word was unwarily put by the Council &amp; ceased not till by the Coun<a id="l4221"></a>cils of Ariminum &amp; Seleucia they got their own decree <a id="l4222"></a>repealed.</p>
<p id="par204">And now Athanasius finding his cause very desparate betook him<a id="l4223"></a>self to those many artifices which we have described above &amp;<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p083r"> &lt;83r&gt; </span> &amp; because the homousios had been abrogated by the authority of <a id="l4224"></a>the Council of Antioch &amp; the authority of his predecessor <a id="l4225"></a>Dionysius lay hard upon him, he endeavoured to avoyd them <a id="l4226"></a>after this manner. He represented<sup class="note" id="n164-ref">[164]</sup>  that what Dionysius <a id="l4227"></a>wrote respected the humane nature of Christ, &amp; that <a id="l4228"></a>some at that time accusing this  Dionysius before <a id="l4229"></a>Dionysius Bishop of Rome, as if he had said that the Son was  <a id="l4230"></a>ποίημα a creature &amp; not consubstantial to the father, a <a id="l4231"></a>Council thereupon collected at Rome was offended &amp; troubled <a id="l4232"></a>at it &amp; the Bishop of Rome wrote back  the com<a id="l4233"></a>mon sentence of them all, opposing as well the opinions <a id="l4234"></a>of Arius as those of Sabellius, &amp; desiring Dionysius of A<a id="l4235"></a>lexandria to explain himself about what was objected to him. <a id="l4236"></a>&amp; that Dionysius of Alexandria thereupon wrote his <a id="l4237"></a>book entituled <em class="underline">The accusation &amp; apology</em>; wherein he maintains that <a id="l4238"></a>Christ was always the word &amp; wisdom – – –</p>
