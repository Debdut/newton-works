<p id="par1">In this short Prophesy are predicted  all the main periods of time relating <a id="l2"></a>to the   Messiah, that of his death, those of both his comings <a id="l3"></a>&amp; that of the ceasing of the dayly sacrifice &amp; setting up the Abomination.</p>
<p id="par2">1. The death of the Messiah is thus predicted. While I was speak<a id="l4"></a>ing in prayer the man Gabriel touched me &amp; informed me by talking <a id="l5"></a>with me &amp; said, O Daniel I am now come forth to give thee <a id="l6"></a>skill &amp; understanding [about thy people for whose restauration <a id="l7"></a>thou prayest.] At the beginning of thy supplications the command<a id="l8"></a>ment came forth [from God] and I am come to shew it thee, for <a id="l9"></a>thou art greatly beloved. Therefore observe well the speech &amp; <a id="l10"></a>consider the Vision. Seventy weeks [of years] are <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> numbred upon <a id="l11"></a>thy people &amp; upon thy Holy City [ in the end of that time] to finish transgression &amp; to <a id="l13"></a><sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> blot out sinns &amp; to make reconciliation for iniquity &amp; to bring <a id="l14"></a>in everlasting righteousness &amp; to <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> seal the Vision &amp; Prophesy [that <a id="l17"></a>Book opened in the Apocalyps] and to annoint the most Holy </p>
<p id="par3">2. The double coming of the Messiah is in the next words thus <a id="l22"></a>predicted. Know also &amp; understand that from the going forth of <a id="l23"></a>the commandment to build Ierusalem again untill the Messiah <a id="l24"></a>the Prince [that is, untill his coming to reign as Prince] shall be <a id="l25"></a>seven weeks.</p>
<p id="par4">Also [that you may not mistake the commandment know  <a id="l26"></a>that untill the Messiah] threescore &amp; two weeks the street shall <a id="l27"></a>be built again and the wall, but [this shall be] in troublesome times <a id="l28"></a>and after the threscore &amp; two weeks the Messiah shall [not reign <a id="l29"></a>as Prince but] be cut off and it [the people or  City] shall not be his <a id="l30"></a>but the people of a Prince that shall come shall destroy the <a id="l31"></a>City &amp; the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a <a id="l32"></a>flood and at the end of the war [untill God's wrath against <a id="l33"></a>thy people shall be fulfilled &amp; they shall return from capti<a id="l34"></a>vity &amp; rebuild Ierusalem] desolations are decreed.</p>
<p id="par5">3. The time of the ceasing of the dayly sacrifice is thus predicted. <a id="l35"></a>And he [that other Prince or People] shall make a firm convenant which many for <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span> a week and in half the week [the latter half] he shall make the <a id="l36"></a>sacrifice &amp; Oblation to  cease &amp; <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> upon the wing  are the Abominations which make it desolate [set up] the Abomination of <a id="l41"></a>desolation &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> untill the consummation [ on the verge [of the Temple] even that which is decreed shall <a id="l42"></a>be poured upon the desolate.</p>
<p id="par6">This is the Prophesy &amp; the Interpretation is as follows.  In the <a id="l43"></a>first part of the Prophesy seventy weeks of years are recconed for the <a id="l44"></a>duration of the People &amp; Holy City unto the death of Christ. For they <a id="l45"></a>recconed unto the finishing of transgression &amp; blotting out of sins &amp; <a id="l46"></a>making reconciliation for iniquity &amp; bringing in everlasting righteousness <a id="l47"></a>all which was accomplished by the death of Christ, &amp; unto the sealing <a id="l48"></a>of  Vision &amp; Prophesy, that book opened in the Apocalyps  part of which may <a id="l49"></a>be justly accounted the prophesies of    Christ untill <a id="l50"></a>his death, he being the greatest of the Prophets and lastly unto the annointing of the most Holy or consecrating <a id="l51"></a>the great High Priest  which was also accomplisht at his death. For <a id="l52"></a>as the High Priest under the law was consecrated which water oyle &amp; <a id="l53"></a>blood (Exod. 29.4, 7, 21) so Christ was consecrated an eternall High Priest by <a id="l54"></a>baptism which water unction with the Holy Ghost &amp; sprinkling with his own <a id="l55"></a>blood. Now the duration of the People &amp; Holy City began when they <a id="l56"></a>first returned from captivity so as to become again a people &amp; Holy City.  <a id="l57"></a>There were but two returns from Captivity Zerubbabell's &amp; Ezra's. In <a id="l58"></a>Zerubbabel's they had only a Commission to build the Temple, in Ezra's <a id="l59"></a>they first became reincorporated into a policy or City by a government of <a id="l60"></a>their own. For Ezra not only revived the worship but also<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> by the Kings <a id="l61"></a>Commission set up Magistrates &amp; Iudges in all the land to judge &amp; govern <a id="l62"></a>the people according to the law of God &amp; the King &amp; punish offenders <a id="l63"></a>with death banishment confiscation &amp; imprisonment &amp; hereby was the sanhe<a id="l64"></a>drim restored &amp; the scattered Iews<sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> in the language <a id="l66"></a>of the Scripture became reunited into a people or city. <a id="l67"></a>Now Ezra returned in the<sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> seventh year of Artaxerxes <a id="l68"></a>And the years of Artaxerxes began about two or <a id="l69"></a>three months after the summer solstice and his seventh year fell in <a id="l70"></a>with the third year of the 80<sup>th</sup> Olympiad, &amp; the latter part thereof <a id="l71"></a>wherein Ezra went up to Ierusalem was in the 4257<sup>th</sup> year of the Iuli<a id="l72"></a>an Period. Count the time from thence to the death of Christ &amp; you <a id="l73"></a>will find it just 490 years, or 70 weeks of years. If you count in Iu<a id="l74"></a>daic civil years commencing in Autumn &amp; date the recconing from the <a id="l75"></a>first Autumn after Ezra's coming to Ierusalem when he put the <a id="l76"></a>Kings decree in Execution: the death of Christ will fall on the year of <a id="l77"></a>the Iulian Period 4747 anno Domini 34 &amp; the weeks will be Iudaic <a id="l78"></a>weeks ending with sabbatical years. And this I take to be the truth. <a id="l79"></a>But if you had rather place the death of Christ in the year before <a id="l80"></a>as is commonly done you may include the year of Ezras Iourney in the <a id="l81"></a>recconing.</p>
  <span class="pagenumber" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span><p id="par7">By the next part of the Prophesy the street &amp; the wall were to be <a id="l82"></a>built sixty &amp; two weeks of years or 434 years untill the Messiah that is <a id="l83"></a> untill the first coming.  Now  they that came up which him from  Artaxerxes  that is Ezra &amp; his companions attempted to rebuild Iersualem &amp; <a id="l84"></a>the wall but were prohibited (Ezra 4.12, 21, 23) &amp; Nehemiah came to Ierusalem in the 20<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l85"></a>of Artaxerxes while Ezra still continued there (Nehem 12.36) &amp; found the <a id="l86"></a>City lying wast &amp; the houses &amp; wall unbuilt (Nehem. 2.17 &amp; 7.4) and <a id="l87"></a>finished the wall in the 25<sup>t</sup> day of the month Elul (Nehem 6.17) in the <a id="l88"></a>28<sup>th</sup> year of the King (Ioseph. <span class="hspac-n" title="11 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) that is in September in the end of the Iewish <a id="l89"></a>year  either in the year of the Iulian period <a id="l90"></a>4278 or in the year before accordingly as the 25<sup>t</sup> of Elul fell on the end of the 28<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l91"></a>of the King or on the beginning of that year. Count now 434 years from  Septem<a id="l92"></a>ber anno I.P. 4278, &amp; the recconing will end in September anno I.P. <a id="l93"></a>4712, the last year of which recconing is the year in which Christ was <a id="l94"></a>born according to Clemens Alexandrinus Irenæus, Eusebius, Epiphanius, Ierom <a id="l95"></a>Orosius Cassiodorus &amp; other ancients. For this was the general opinion of <a id="l96"></a>the Ancients till Dionysius Exiguus invented the vulgar accompt in <a id="l97"></a>which Christs birth is placed two years later.  And it is observable <a id="l98"></a>that in this recconing  the sixty two  weeks like the 70  are Iewish weeks ending <a id="l99"></a>with sabbatical years which makes the Prophesy more elegant.  If which <a id="l100"></a>some you reccon that Christ was born 3 or 4 years before the <a id="l101"></a>vulgar accompt yet his birth will fall in the latter part of <a id="l102"></a>the last week which is enough. How after these weeks Christ was <a id="l103"></a>cut off &amp; the city &amp; sanctuary destroyed by the Romans is well <a id="l104"></a>known.</p>
  <p id="par8">By the last part of the Prophesy the Romans who captivated the <a id="l105"></a>Iews were to make a firm league which many for a week and in half <a id="l106"></a>the week to take away the dayly sacrifice &amp; set up the abomination <a id="l107"></a>and so it fell out. For the Romans made a firm peace which the <a id="l108"></a>eastern Princes of the Medes Parthians &amp; Armenians A.D. 63 towards <a id="l109"></a>the end of summer upon which the Temple of Ianus was shut  <a id="l110"></a>(as the learned Bishop of Worchester has shewed), &amp;  in the beginning of the year 67  in spring or towards the end of winter under the conduct <a id="l112"></a>of Vespasian &amp; Titus they began the war upon the Iews &amp; made the sacri<a id="l113"></a>fice &amp; Oblation to cease Iuly 17 A.D. 70, &amp; set fire on the Temple <a id="l114"></a>Aug 10 ensuing, &amp; while the Temple was burning set up their <a id="l115"></a>ensignes, which were the Images of their Gods, in the Close or border <a id="l116"></a>of the Temple over against the eastern gate and sacrificed to <a id="l117"></a> them according to their Idolatrous manner, &amp; soon after burnt the <a id="l118"></a> lower city and on Sept 7<sup>th</sup> ensuing took the upper city, &amp; by <a id="l119"></a>these &amp; other ensuing warrs the land was emptied of Iews &amp; remains <a id="l120"></a>desolate to this day.</p></div>

<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">An Interpretation of the Prophesy of Daniel's <a id="l121"></a>weeks by Iewish years</h2>
<p id="par9">In this short Prophesy (according to the following interpretation are predicted all the main periods <a id="l122"></a>of time relating to the Messiah,  <a id="l123"></a> the  ceasing of his acting as a Prophet &amp; commencement of his <a id="l124"></a>High-Priesthood; the commencement of his reign as Prince, the time of his birth or coming as a Prophet &amp; the time of taking away <a id="l125"></a>the dayly sacrifice &amp; setting up the abomination:  so that the interpretation is full. It renders the whole <a id="l127"></a>prophesy very <a id="l128"></a>significant without <a id="l129"></a>defect or super<a id="l130"></a>fluity.</p>
  <p id="par10">1. The  period of his acting as Prophet &amp; commencement of his High priesthood is thus predicted. While I was <a id="l131"></a>speaking in prayer the man Gabriel touched me &amp; informed me <a id="l132"></a>by talking with me &amp; said, O Daniel I am now come forth to <a id="l133"></a>give thee skill &amp; understanding [about thy People for whose <a id="l134"></a>restauration after 70 years captivity thou prayest.] At the beginning of thy supplicati<a id="l135"></a>ons the commandment came forth [from God] and I am come <a id="l136"></a>to shew it thee, for thou art greatly beloved.  Therefore observe <a id="l137"></a>well the speech &amp; consider the Vision. Seventy weeks [of years] <a id="l138"></a>are <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> numbred upon thy people &amp; upon thy holy City [in the end <a id="l144"></a>of that time] to finish transgression &amp; to <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> blot out sins &amp; to <a id="l148"></a>make reconciliation for iniquity &amp; to bring in everlasting righteousness [by the attonement of the great High Priest] <a id="l149"></a>&amp; to <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> seal [or finish] the [book of] Vision &amp; Prophesy  [by the death of the  expected Prophet] <a id="l161"></a>&amp; to annoint the most Holy [or consecrate the great High Priest, who makes the attonement]</p>

<h2 id="hd3" class="cent">This is the Prophesy, and the Interpretation <a id="l182"></a>is as follows.</h2>
<p id="par14">In the first part of the Prophesy seventy weeks of years are reccon<a id="l183"></a>ed for the duration of the People &amp; Holy City unto the death of Christ <a id="l184"></a>whereby he ceased to act as a Prophet &amp; was consecrated an High Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedeck. For they are recconed unto the finishing of Transgression &amp; blotting out <a id="l185"></a>of sins &amp; making reconciliation for iniquity &amp; bringing in everlasting <a id="l186"></a>righteousness (all which were accomplished by the death of Christ who as a more perfect High Priest then those under the Law offered himself once for all a sacrifice for sin Heb. 7.27 &amp; 9.12, 14, 26.) &amp; unto <a id="l187"></a>the sealing of the book of Vision &amp; Prophesy that book opened in the Apocalyps, <a id="l188"></a>part of which may be justly accounted the prophesies of Christ untill <a id="l189"></a>his death he being the Prophet predicted by Moses the last &amp; greatest of the Prophets under the law, &amp; lastly unto <a id="l190"></a>the annointing of the most Holy or consecrating the great High <a id="l191"></a>Priest, which also was accomplisht at his death. For as the High <a id="l192"></a>Priest under the law was consecrated which water oyle &amp; blood (Exod. <a id="l193"></a>29.4, 7, 21) so Christ was consecrated an eternal High Priest by <a id="l194"></a>baptism with water, unction which the Holy Ghost &amp; sprinkling with <a id="l195"></a>his own blood.  Now the duration of the People &amp; Holy City <a id="l196"></a>began when they first returned from captivity so as to become <a id="l197"></a>again a people &amp; Holy City, &amp; this was under Ezra. There were <a id="l198"></a>but two returns from captivity Zerubbabel's &amp; Ezra's. In Ze<a id="l199"></a>rubbabel's they had only a commission to build the Temple, in <a id="l200"></a>Ezra's they first became reincorporated into a  people or polity by a government of their own. <a id="l202"></a>For Ezra not only revived the worship but also by the Kings <a id="l203"></a>commission <sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup>  set up Magistrates &amp; Iudges in all the land to <a id="l204"></a>judge &amp; governe the people according to the law of God &amp; the <a id="l205"></a>King &amp; punish offenders which death banishment confiscation of <a id="l206"></a>goods &amp; imprisonment (Ezra 7) &amp; hereby was the Sanhedrim restored &amp; <a id="l207"></a>the scattered Iews, (in the language of the scripture Isa. 23.13 &amp; 7.8 <a id="l208"></a>&amp; Ier. 48.42, 46, 47) became reunited into a people or city.  This return of Ezra from captivity was in the seventh year of Artaxerxes  (Ezra 7.7, 8, 9) &amp; the years of Artaxer<a id="l211"></a>xes began  in autumn (Ezra 7.7, 8, 9. Nehem. 1.1 &amp; 2.1 &amp; 5.14) &amp; his seventh year fell in which the third year of the <a id="l213"></a>80<sup>th</sup> Olympiad &amp; the latter part thereof wherein Ezra went <a id="l214"></a>up to Ierusalem was in the 4257<sup>th</sup> year of the Iulian Period<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l215"></a>Count the time from thence to the death of Christ &amp; you <a id="l216"></a>will find it just 490 years, or 70 weeks of years. If you <a id="l217"></a>count in Iudaic civil years commencing in Autumn &amp; date <a id="l218"></a>the recconing from the first Autumn after Ezra's coming <a id="l219"></a>to Ierusalem when he put the Kings Decree in execution: <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> the death of Christ will fall on the year of the Iulian Period <a id="l220"></a>4747  &amp; year of our Lord 34, &amp; the weeks will be Iudaic <a id="l221"></a>weeks ending with sabbatical years. And this I take to be the truth. <a id="l222"></a>But if you had rather place the death of Christ in the year <a id="l223"></a>before as is commonly done, you may include the year of Ezra's <a id="l224"></a>Iourney in the recconing.</p>
<p id="par15"> The next part of the Prophesy concering the coming of the Messiah as Prince is not yet fulfilled by that part which follows. By the 3<sup>d</sup> part thereof the street &amp; the wall <a id="l225"></a>were to be build sixty &amp; two weeks of years or 434 years untill <a id="l226"></a>the Messiah, that is untill  his other coming when he should not reign but be cut off. Now before the Iews <a id="l227"></a>attempted to rebuild the wall they rebuilt the Temple in the reign <a id="l228"></a>of Cyrus &amp; Darius. Then they that came up  from Artaxerxes, <a id="l229"></a>(that is Ezra &amp; his companions,) having a larger Commission then Zerub<a id="l230"></a>babel's, attempted to rebuild also the City &amp; the wall but were opposed <a id="l231"></a>&amp; prohibited (Ezra 4.12, 21, 23) &amp; in the 20<sup>th</sup> year of the King Nehe<a id="l232"></a>miah came to Ierusalem while Ezra still continued there (Nehem. <a id="l233"></a>12.36) &amp; found the City lying wast &amp; the houses &amp; wall unbuilt <a id="l234"></a>(Nehem 2.17 &amp; 7.4) and rebuilt them by the Kings commission and <a id="l235"></a>finished the wall in the 25<sup>th</sup> day of the Month Elul (Nehem. 6.17) <a id="l236"></a>in the 28<sup>th</sup> year of the King (Ioseph. <span class="hspac-n" title="11 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) that is in <a id="l237"></a>September in the end of the Iewish civil year,  in the  year of <a id="l238"></a>the Iulian Period 4278 or perhaps in the year before  if the 25<sup>t</sup> <a id="l239"></a>of Elul fell on the  beginning of the 28<sup>th</sup> year of the King.  Count now 434 years from September anno <a id="l241"></a>I.P. 4278 &amp; the recconing will end in september anno I.P. 4712, the last <a id="l242"></a>year of which recconing is the year in which Christ was born according to <a id="l243"></a>Clemens Alexandrinus, Irenæus, Eusebius, Epiphanius, Ierome, Orosius, Cassi<a id="l244"></a>odorus &amp; other ancients. For this was the general opinion of the An<a id="l245"></a>cients till Dionysius Exiguus invented the vulgar accopmt in which Christs <a id="l246"></a>birth is placed two years later. And it is observable that in this reccon<a id="l247"></a>ing the sixty two weeks (as well as the seventy) are Iewish weeks ending <a id="l248"></a>with sabbatical years; which makes the Prophesy more elegant. If which some <a id="l249"></a>you reccon that Christ was born three or four years before the vulgar <a id="l250"></a>accompt, yet his birth will fall in the latter part of the last week, which <a id="l251"></a>is enough. How after these weeks Christ was cut off &amp; the city &amp; sanctu<a id="l252"></a>ary destroyed by the Romans is well known.</p>
<p id="par16">By the last part of the Prophesy the Romans who captivated the <a id="l253"></a>Iews were to make a firm league with  many for a week, and in <a id="l254"></a>half the week to take away the daily sacrifice &amp; set up the abomination, <a id="l255"></a>and so it fell out. The Romans made a firm peace which  the eastern <a id="l256"></a>Princes of the Medes Parthians &amp; Armenians  towards the end of <a id="l257"></a>summer A.D. 63 upon which the Temple of Ianus was shut (as the learned Bishop of <a id="l258"></a>Worcester has explained) and in the beginning of the year 67 in spring or <a id="l259"></a>towards the end of winter, under the conduct of Vespasian &amp; Titus they <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004v"> &lt;4v&gt; </span> began the war upon the Iews &amp; made the sacrifice &amp; Oblation <a id="l260"></a>to cease Iuly 17, A.D. 70, &amp; set fire on the Temple Aug. 10 ensuing, <a id="l261"></a>&amp; while the Temple was burning set up their ensignes, which were <a id="l262"></a>the Images of their Gods, in the Close or border of the Temple <a id="l263"></a>over against the eastern Gate &amp; sacrificed to them according to <a id="l264"></a>their idolatrous manner &amp; soon after burnt the lower City &amp; <a id="l265"></a>on Sept 7<sup>th</sup> ensuing took the upper City &amp; by these  wars the land was emptied of Iews &amp; remains desolate <a id="l267"></a>to this day.</p>
<p id="par17">The seven weeks from the going forth of the commandment to <a id="l268"></a>build Ierusalem again unto the Messiah the Prince remain to be <a id="l269"></a>interpreted .  In dating them from  a commandment which  is to end the great <a id="l270"></a>captivity &amp; usher in the reign of the Messiah the Prince, I beleive <a id="l271"></a>the Iews who express  his future reign, will  not much oppose me. <a id="l272"></a>For all Daniels Prophesies reach to those times &amp; there is scarce a <a id="l273"></a>Prophesy in the old Testament concerning Christ which doth not in <a id="l274"></a>something or other relate to his second coming. If divers of the <a id="l275"></a>Ancients as Irenæus (l. 5 Hær. c. 25) Iulius Africanus () Hippo<a id="l276"></a>litus the Martyr &amp; Apollinaris Bishop of Laodicea (apud Hieron. in h. l.), applied the half week <a id="l277"></a>to the times of Antichrist, why may not we by the same liberty of <a id="l278"></a>Interpretation apply the seven weeks to the time when Antichrist shall <a id="l279"></a>be destroyed by the brightness of Christs coming. The Israelites in the <a id="l280"></a>days of the ancient Prophets when the ten Tribes were led into captivity expected a double return from Captivity <a id="l281"></a>&amp; that at the first return the Iews should build a new Temple  inferior to Solomon's untill the time of the age should be fulfilled and <a id="l283"></a>afterwards they should return from all places of their captivity &amp; <a id="l284"></a>build Ierusalem and the Temple gloriously (Tobit 14.4, 5, 6) And to <a id="l285"></a>express the glory &amp; excellence of this City tis figuratively said to <a id="l286"></a>be built of precious stones (Tobit 13.16, 17, 18. Isa 54.11, 12. Apoc 21) &amp; <a id="l287"></a>called the new Ierusalem, the heavenly Ierusalem, the holy City, the <a id="l288"></a>Lambs wife, the City of the great King, the City into which the Kings <a id="l289"></a>of the earth do bring their glory &amp; honour. And while such a <a id="l290"></a>return from captivity was the expectation of Israel even before <a id="l291"></a>the times of Daniel, I know not why Daniel should omit it in <a id="l292"></a>this Prophesy. This part of the Prophesy therefore being not yet fulfill<a id="l293"></a>ed I attempt not to interpret it, but shall  content my self with observing, that as the 70 <a id="l294"></a>weeks &amp; the 62 weeks were Iewish weeks ending which sabbatical years <a id="l295"></a>so the seven weeks are the compass of a Iubile &amp; begin &amp; end with <a id="l296"></a>actions proper for a Iubile &amp; of the highest nature for which a Iubile can be kept; and that <a id="l297"></a>since the Commandment to rebuild Ierusalem precedes the Messiah the Prince 49 years, it may perhaps come <a id="l298"></a>forth not from the Iews themselves but from some other Kingdom friendly <a id="l299"></a>to them  &amp; precede their return from captivity, &amp; give occasion to it <a id="l300"></a>&amp; lastly that this return from captivity &amp; coming of the Messiah &amp; his Kingdom <a id="l301"></a>are described in Dan. 7 Apoc 19. Act. 1 Matt. 24 Ioel 3. Ezek 36, 37. Isa. 60, 62, 63, 65, <a id="l302"></a>66 &amp; many other places of scripture. The answer I know not. Let Time be the Interpreter.</p></div>

<div><h2 id="hd4" class="cent"> <a id="l303"></a><br>How it may be possible to interpret Daniels weeks by Iewish years.</h2>
<p id="par18">In this short Prophesy are predicted the  times of the death of the Messiah &amp; of both his  <a id="l304"></a>comings  &amp;  also that of the destruction of Ierusalem. For all Daniel's Pro<a id="l305"></a>phesies extend to Christ's second coming. </p>
<p id="par19">1. The death of the Messiah is thus predicted. While I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel touched me &amp; <a id="l306"></a>informed me by talking with me &amp; said, O Daniel I am now come forth <a id="l307"></a>to give thee skill &amp; understanding [about thy people for whose restauration thou prayest] <a id="l308"></a>At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth <a id="l309"></a>[from God] &amp; I am come to shew it thee, for thou art greatly <a id="l310"></a>beloved. Therefore observe well the speech &amp; consider the Vision. <a id="l311"></a>Seventy weeks [of years] are <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> numbred upon  thy people <a id="l313"></a>&amp; upon  thy Holy City [viz<sup>t</sup> from the time that it shall <a id="l314"></a>be reincorporated into a people &amp; Holy City] to finish transgression &amp; <a id="l315"></a>to  <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> blot out sinns &amp; to make reconciliation for iniquity &amp; to bring <a id="l316"></a>in everlasting righteousness &amp; to seal  <a id="l317"></a>the  Vision &amp; Prophesy [that book  <a id="l318"></a>opened in the Apocalyps] &amp; to annoint the most Holy [or consecrate <a id="l319"></a>the great High Priest,  that is by baptism which water unction which the spirit &amp; sprinkling which <a id="l320"></a>his own blood. For the High Priest was consecrated by water oyle &amp; blood Exod 29.4, 7, 21.]</p>
<p id="par20">2. The double coming  of the Messiah is in the next words thus predicted.</p>
<p id="par21">Know also &amp; understand that from the going forth of the com<a id="l321"></a>mandment to build Ierusalem again untill the Messiah the Prince <a id="l322"></a>[that is untill his coming to reign as Prince] shall be seven weeks  <a id="l323"></a></p>
<p id="par22">Also [that you may not mistake the Commandment know also that untill the Messiah] threescore &amp; two weeks the street shall be built again <a id="l324"></a>&amp; the wall [untill the Messiah] but [this shall be] in troublesome times <a id="l325"></a>&amp; after the threscore and two weeks the Messiah shall [not reign <a id="l326"></a>as Prince but] be cut off and [the People or Kingdom] not be his, <a id="l327"></a>but the people of a Prince that shall come shall destroy the City <a id="l328"></a>&amp; the Sanctuary &amp; the end thereof shall be with a flood &amp; at <a id="l329"></a>the end of the war [untill God's wrath against thy people shall be <a id="l330"></a>fulfilled &amp; they shall return from captivity &amp; rebuild Ierusalem] <a id="l331"></a>desolations are decreed.</p>
<p id="par23">3. The time of the destruction of Ierusalem is thus predicted.  And he [that other Prince] shall make a firm covenant with <a id="l332"></a>many for a week &amp; in half the week [the latter half] he shall <a id="l333"></a>make the Sacrifice &amp; Oblation to cease &amp; with a wing of abo<a id="l334"></a>minations he shall  cause desolation &amp; untill the consumma<a id="l335"></a>tion even that which is decreed shall be poured upon the desolate</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p005v"> &lt;5v&gt; </span>
<p id="par24"> This is the Prophesy, &amp; the first part  thereof was thus fulfilled.  In the <a id="l336"></a>seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus  Ezra  returned from Babylon which a body of Iews &amp; a commissi<a id="l338"></a>on not only to  revive the Iewish worship but also to set Magistrates &amp; <a id="l339"></a>Iudges over the Land  who might judge the people according to the laws of their God &amp; of the King &amp; punish Offenders with death <a id="l340"></a>or banishment or confiscation of goods or imprisonment  And by this <a id="l341"></a>commission was the Sanhedrim &amp; Iewish Polity or Government restored &amp; the Iews reincorporated into a <a id="l342"></a>Nation &amp; Holy City: Now from this year to the death of Christ  <a id="l343"></a>A.C. 33 are just 490 solar years or 70 weeks of years, as Daniel pre<a id="l344"></a>dicted</p>
<p id="par25">By the next part of the Prophesy the  street &amp; the wall <a id="l345"></a>of Ierusalem were to  be  built 62 weeks of years or 434 years untill <a id="l346"></a>the first coming of the Messiah: &amp; so many solar years there are from <a id="l347"></a>the 28<sup>th</sup> year of Artaxerxes Longimanus when Iosephus tells us the <a id="l348"></a>wall was  finished, unto the Nativity of Christ two years before the vulgar <a id="l349"></a>Æra.</p>
<p id="par26">By the last part of the Prophysy the  Romans who  <a id="l350"></a>captivated the Iews were to make a firm league which many for a week <a id="l351"></a>&amp; in the latter half of the week to take away the dayly sacrifice &amp; <a id="l352"></a>oblation &amp; place the abomination &amp; so it fell out as the  learned Bishop  LLoyd has explained. <a id="l353"></a>For  the Romans made a firm peace which the Eastern Princes of the Medes, Parthicans <a id="l354"></a>&amp; Armenians A.C. 63  towards the end of summer: upon which <a id="l355"></a>the Temple of Ianus was shut &amp;  towards the end of winter in <a id="l356"></a>the beginning of the year 67 of Christ the Romans under Vespasian &amp; Titus began the warr upon <a id="l357"></a>the Iews  &amp;  the sacrifice &amp; oblation  ceased Iuly 17 A.C. 70 &amp; the Temple was  set on fire Aug 10 following <a id="l359"></a>&amp; the lower city burnt presently after &amp; the upper City taken Sept 7 following</p>

<p id="par28">When &amp; how the present captivity of the Iews shall return &amp; Ieru<a id="l364"></a>salem be rebuilt is not here predicted nor after what manner the <a id="l365"></a>Messiah shall come as Prince.  <a id="l366"></a>But  as he is to come  in the end of seven weeks of years or in the year of Iubile counted <a id="l367"></a>from the going forth of the commandment to rebuild Ierusalem so its <a id="l368"></a> fit that a Iubile <a id="l370"></a>should be then kept as well for the day of the Messiah as in memory of the commandment to rebuild Ierusalem. For <a id="l371"></a>  this is the new Ierusalem the <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Citadel<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> which for its glory &amp; dominion is figuratively said to be in heaven &amp; to be built which <a id="l372"></a>pretious stones Tobit 14.5, 6 &amp; 13.16, 17 Isa. 54.11, 12. Apoc. 21. the ancient  sabbattick years &amp; <a id="l373"></a>Iubiles beeing kept by the Iews as a type of that day. The manner of his coming <a id="l374"></a>you have described in other Prophesies Dan 7.13, 14 Mattt 24.27, 30. Acts 1.11 Apoc 19.15, 16</p>
<p id="par29">I enter not into the disputes about the years of Christs birth &amp; death. <a id="l375"></a>The Prophesy runs by weeks of years: &amp; as in recconing by days we neg<a id="l376"></a>lect the odd hours &amp; in recconing by weeks we neglect the odd days so in <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> by weeks of years it may not be necessary to regard a year or two over or under</p>

<p id="par31">Daniel in recconing by weeks of years uses the Iewish Lunisolar years which ran <a id="l379"></a>by sevens, every seventh year being a sabbatical one.  For <a id="l380"></a>the birth &amp; death of Christ &amp; destruction of Ierusalem fell on sabbatical <a id="l381"></a>years &amp; therefore all Daniels weeks already past end in Sabbatical years. Which makes <a id="l382"></a>it highly probable that the  seven weeks to come shall be of the same <a id="l383"></a>kind, especially since they contein the space of a Iubile. For why should not <a id="l384"></a>the year  in which the commandment shal goe forth to rebuild Ierusalem &amp; <a id="l385"></a>the yeare in which the Messiah shall come to be Prince be celebrated by the <a id="l386"></a>Iews which a Iubile. For this City is the new Ierusalem  the heavenly Ierusalem the Holy City the Lambs wife <a id="l387"></a>which for its glory &amp; dominion is figuratively said to come down from <a id="l388"></a>heaven &amp; be built of precious stones (Apoc 21. Isa 54.11, 12  Tobit 13.16, 17 <a id="l389"></a> &amp; 14.5, 6.) &amp; therefore its Encœnia deserves the greatest of solemmities <a id="l390"></a> except the day of the Messiah the Prince to be celebrated 49 years after.  in propsect of which <a id="l391"></a>the Iews kept the last day of the feast of Tabernacles which the highest degrees <a id="l392"></a>of rejoycing.</p><br><br>

<div><h2 id="hd5" class="cent">An Interpretation of the Prophesy of Daniel's weeks <a id="l415"></a>by Iewish years.</h2>
<p id="par37">Let the Messiah be considered as a Prophet  in his lifetime, as an High <a id="l416"></a>Priest making intercession for us in the Heavens from the time of his death <a id="l417"></a>resurrection &amp; ascention &amp; as a King after his return or second coming: <a id="l418"></a>and in this short Prophesy according to the following interpretation <a id="l419"></a>will be predicted all the main periods of time relating to him &amp; his <a id="l420"></a>kingdom, so that the interpretation is full. It determins the beginning of <a id="l421"></a>his High-priesthood, the beginning of his reign as Prince, the time of his birth or <a id="l422"></a>coming as a Prophet &amp; the time of destroying the city &amp; sanctuary <a id="l423"></a>taking away the dayly sacrifice &amp; setting up the abomination: &amp; <a id="l424"></a>by doing all this it renders the whole Prophesy very significant without <a id="l425"></a>defect or superfluity.</p>
<p id="par38">1. The beginning of his Highpriesthood is thus predicted. <em class="underline">While I was <a id="l426"></a>speaking in prayer the man Gabriel touched me &amp; informed me by talk<a id="l427"></a>ing with me &amp; said, O Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill <a id="l428"></a>&amp; understanding</em> [about thy people for whose restauration  after <a id="l429"></a>seventy years captivity thou prayest.] <em class="underline">At the beginning of thy suppli<a id="l430"></a>cations the commandment came forth</em> [from God] <em class="underline">&amp; I am come to shew <a id="l431"></a>it thee, for thou art greatly beloved. Therefore observe well the speech &amp; <a id="l432"></a>consider the Vision. Seventy weeks</em> [of years] <em class="underline">are <a id="l433"></a><sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup> numbred upon thy people &amp; upon thy Holy City</em> [in the <a id="l436"></a>end of that time] <em class="underline">to finish transgression &amp; to <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup> blot <a id="l438"></a>out sins &amp; to make reconciliation for iniquity &amp; to bring in <a id="l439"></a>everlasting righteousness</em> [by the attonement of the <a id="l440"></a>great High Priest] <em class="underline">and to seal</em> [or <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup> finish] <em class="underline">the</em> [book of] <a id="l448"></a><em class="underline">Vision &amp; Prophesy</em> [by the death of the great Prophet] <a id="l449"></a><em class="underline">&amp; to annoint the most Holy</em> [or consecrate the great <a id="l450"></a>High Priest who makes the attonement.]</p>
<p id="par39">2. The beginning of his reign is in the next words thus predicted. <em class="underline">Know <a id="l451"></a>also &amp; understand that from the going forth of the commandment to <a id="l452"></a>build Ierusalem again unto the Messiah the Prince</em> [that is untill his <a id="l453"></a>coming to be Prince or untill the beginning of his reign] <em class="underline">shall be <a id="l454"></a>seven weeks.</em></p>
<p id="par40">3. Then follows the birth of the Messiah &amp; consequent state of the Iews  in these words. <em class="underline">Also</em> [that you may not mistake the commandment <a id="l456"></a>know that there shall precede another commandment to build Ierusa<a id="l457"></a>lem &amp; thereupon] <em class="underline">threscore &amp; two weeks the street shall be built <a id="l458"></a>again &amp; the wall</em> [untill the Messiah] <em class="underline">but</em> [this shall be] <em class="underline">in trouble<a id="l459"></a>some times &amp; after the threscore &amp; two weeks the Messiah shall</em> [not <a id="l460"></a>reign as Prince but coming only as a Prophet  shall] <em class="underline">be cut off &amp; it</em> [the people <a id="l461"></a>or city] <em class="underline">shall not be his but the</em> [idolatrous] <sup>People of a Prince that shall come &amp;</sup> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007v"> &lt;7v&gt; </span> <em class="underline">shall destroy the City &amp; the Sanctuary &amp; the end thereof shall be which a flood &amp; <a id="l462"></a>at the end of the warr</em> [untill the commandment shall go forth to build <a id="l463"></a>Ierusalem again] <em class="underline">desolations are decreed.</em></p>
<p id="par41">4. Lastly the ceasing of the daily sacrifice is thus predicted. And he [that <a id="l464"></a>other Prince or people] shall make a firm covenant which many for a <a id="l465"></a>week &amp; in half the week [the latter half] he shall [in destroying the city &amp; Sanctu<a id="l466"></a>ary ] make the sacrifice &amp; Oblation to cease &amp; on the verge [of the <a id="l467"></a>Temple set up] the Abomination <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup> of desolation &amp; <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup> untill the <a id="l469"></a>consummation even that which is decreed shall be poured upon the <a id="l470"></a>desolate.</p></div>
<div><h2 id="hd6" class="cent">This is the Prophesy and the Interpretation is as follows.</h2>
<p id="par42">In the first part of the Prophesy seventy weeks of years are recconed <a id="l471"></a>for the duration of the People &amp; Holy City unto the death of Christ whereby he <a id="l472"></a>ceased to act as a Prophet &amp; was consecrated an High Priest for ever after the <a id="l473"></a>order of Melchisedeck. For they are recconed unto the finishing of transgression <a id="l474"></a>&amp; blotting out of sins &amp; making reconciliation for iniquity &amp; bringing in ever <a id="l475"></a>lasting righteousness (all which was accomplished by the death of Christ who as a more <a id="l476"></a>perfect High Priest then those under the law offered himself once for all a <a id="l477"></a>sacrifice for putting away sin. Heb. 7.27 &amp; 9.12, 14, 26) &amp; unto the sealing or finishing of the book of Vision <a id="l478"></a>&amp; Prophesy that book opened in the Apocalyps, part of which may be justly <a id="l479"></a>accompted the prophesies of Christ untill his death he being the Prophet pre<a id="l480"></a>dicted by Moses, the last &amp; greatest of the Prophets under the law; and lastly <a id="l481"></a>unto the annointing of the most Holy or consecrating the great High Priest, <a id="l482"></a>which was also accomplished at his death. For as the High Priest under the <a id="l483"></a>Law was consecrated which water oyle &amp; blood (Exod. 29.4, 7, 21) so Christ was <a id="l484"></a>consecrated an eternal High Priest by baptism which water, unction with the <a id="l485"></a>Holy ghost &amp; sprinkling which his own blood. Now the duration of the People &amp; <a id="l486"></a>Holy City began when they first returned from captivity so as to become <a id="l487"></a>again a people &amp;  City &amp; this was under Ezra. There were but two <a id="l488"></a>returns from captivity Zerubbabel's &amp; Ezra's. In Zerubbabel's they had <a id="l489"></a>only a commission to build the Temple, in Ezra's they first became rein<a id="l490"></a>corporated into a people or polity by a government of their own. For <a id="l491"></a>Ezra not only revived the worship but also by the Kings commission set up <a id="l492"></a>Magistrates &amp; Iudges in all the Land to judge &amp; govern the people according <a id="l493"></a>to the law of God &amp; the King &amp; punish offenders with death banishment con<a id="l494"></a>fiscation of goods &amp; imprisonment (Ezra 7) &amp; hereby was the Sanhedrim <a id="l495"></a>restored &amp; the scattered Iews (in the language of the scripture Isa. 23.13 &amp; 7.8 <a id="l496"></a>&amp; Ier 48.42, 46, 47) became reunited into a People or City. This return of <a id="l497"></a>Ezra from captivity was in the seventh year of Artaxerxes (Ezra 7.7, 8, 9) &amp; the <a id="l498"></a>years of Artaxerxes began in autumn (Ezra 7.7, 8, 9. Nehem 1.1 &amp; 2.1 &amp; 5.14) &amp; his <a id="l499"></a>seventh year fell in with the third year of the 80<sup>th</sup> Olympiad &amp; the latter <a id="l500"></a>part thereof wherein Ezra went up to Ierusalem was in the 4257<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l501"></a>the Iulian Period. Count the time from thence to the death of Christ &amp; you <a id="l502"></a>will find it just 490 years or 70 weeks of years. If you count in <a id="l503"></a>Iudaic civil years commencing in Autumn &amp; date the recconing from <a id="l504"></a>the first autumn after Ezra's coming to Ierusalem when he put the <a id="l505"></a>King's decree in execution: the death of Christ will fall on the year of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> Iulian Period 4747 &amp; year of our Lord 34 &amp; the weeks will be Iudaic weeks <a id="l506"></a>ending with sabbatical years. And this I take to be the truth. But if you <a id="l507"></a>had rather place the death of Christ in the year before as is commonly <a id="l508"></a>done, you may include the year of Ezra's journey in the recconing.</p>
<p id="par43">The next part of the Prophesy concerns the coming of the Messiah <a id="l509"></a>as Prince &amp; is not yet fulfilled. By the third part thereof the street &amp; <a id="l510"></a>the wall were to be built threescore &amp; two weeks of years or 434 years <a id="l511"></a>untill the Messiah, that is untill his other coming when he should not <a id="l512"></a>reign but be cut off. Now before the Iews attempted to rebuild the wall <a id="l513"></a>they rebuilt the Temple in the reign of Cyrus &amp; Darius. Then they <a id="l514"></a>that came up from Artaxerxes, <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>(<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>that is Ezra &amp; his companions) having a <a id="l515"></a>larger commission then Zerubbabel's, attempted to rebuild also the City &amp; <a id="l516"></a>the wall but were opposed &amp; prohibited (Ezra 4.12, 21, 23) &amp; in the 20<sup>th</sup> <a id="l517"></a>year of the King Nehemiah came to Ierusalem while Ezra still con<a id="l518"></a>tinued there (Nehem. 12.36) &amp; found the City lying wast &amp; the <a id="l519"></a>houses &amp; wall unbuilt (Nehem 2.17 &amp; 7.4) &amp; rebuilt them by the Kings <a id="l520"></a>commission &amp; finished the wall on the 25<sup>th</sup> day of the month Elul <a id="l521"></a>(Nehem. 6.17) in the 28<sup>th</sup> year of the King (Ioseph. Antiq. l. 11. c. 5 <span class="hspac-n" title="2 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) <a id="l522"></a>that is in September in the end of the Iewish civil year, in the year <a id="l523"></a>of the Iulian Period 4278, or perhaps in the year before if the 25<sup>th</sup> of <a id="l524"></a>Elul fell on the beginning of the 28<sup>th</sup> year of the King. Count now <a id="l525"></a>434 years from September anno I.P. 4278 and the recconing will <a id="l526"></a>end in September anno I.P. 4712, the last year of which recconing is <a id="l527"></a>the year  in which Christ was born according to Clemens Alexandrinus, Ire<a id="l528"></a>næus, Eusebius, Epiphanius, Ierome, Orosius, Cassiodorus &amp; other an<a id="l529"></a>cients. For this was the general opinion of the ancients till Dionysius <a id="l530"></a>Exiguus invented the vulgar accompt in which Christs birth is placed two <a id="l531"></a>years later. And it is observable that in this recconing the sixty two <a id="l532"></a>weeks (as well as the seventy) are Iewish weeks ending with sabbatical <a id="l533"></a>years; which makes the Prophesy more elegant. If with some you reccon <a id="l534"></a>that Christ was born three or four years before the vulgar accompt <a id="l535"></a>yet his birth will fall in the latter part of the last week, which is enough. <a id="l536"></a>How after these weeks the Messiah was cut off &amp; the City &amp; Sanctuary <a id="l537"></a>destroyed by the Romans is well known.</p>
<p id="par44">By the last part of the Prophesy the Romans who destroy the City <a id="l538"></a>were to make a firm league which many for a week &amp; in half the week <a id="l539"></a>to take away the daily sacrifice &amp; set up the abomination, &amp; so it fell out. <a id="l540"></a>The Romans made a firm peace which the eastern Princes of the Medes <a id="l541"></a>Parthians &amp; Armenians towards the end of summer A.D. 63, upon which <a id="l542"></a>the Temple of Ianus was shut (as the learned Bishop of Worcester has <a id="l543"></a>explained) &amp; in the beginning of the year 67 in spring or towards <a id="l544"></a>the end of winter under the conduct of Vespasian &amp; Titus they began <a id="l545"></a>the war upon the Iews &amp; made the Sacrifice &amp; Oblation to cease <a id="l546"></a>Iuly 17, A.D. 70, &amp; set fire on the Temple Aug. 10 ensuing, &amp; while the 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008v"> &lt;8v&gt; </span> Temple was burning set up their ensignes which were the Images of their Gods <a id="l547"></a>in the Close or border of the Temple over against the Eastern Gate &amp; <a id="l548"></a>sacrificed to them according to their idolatrous manner &amp; soon after <a id="l549"></a>burnt the lower City &amp; on Sept. 7<sup>th</sup> ensuing took the upper City &amp; by <a id="l550"></a>these warrs the land was emptied of Iews &amp; remains desolate to this day.</p>
<p id="par45">The seven weeks from the going forth of the commandment to build <a id="l551"></a>Ierusalem again unto the Messiah the Prince, remain to be interpreted. In <a id="l552"></a>dating them from a commandment which is to end the great captivity &amp; usher in <a id="l553"></a>the reign of the Messiah I beleive the Iews will not much oppose me. for they <a id="l554"></a>expect his future reign &amp; all Daniels prophesies reach to those times and <a id="l555"></a>there is scarce a Prophesy in the old Testament concerning Christ which doth <a id="l556"></a>not in something or other relate to his second coming. If divers of the An<a id="l557"></a>cients, as Irenæus (l. 5 Hæres. c. 25) Iulius Africanus, Hippolytus the martyr <a id="l558"></a>&amp; Apollonius Bishop of Laodicea (apud Hieron. in h. l.) applied the half week <a id="l559"></a>to the times of Antichrist, why may not we by the same liberty of Inter<a id="l560"></a>pretation apply the seven weeks to the time when Antichrist shall be de<a id="l561"></a>stroyed by the brightness of Christ's coming. The Israelites in the days of the <a id="l562"></a>ancient Prophets when the ten Tribes were led into captivity expected a <a id="l563"></a>double return from captivity &amp; that at the first return the Iews should <a id="l564"></a>build a new Temple inferior to Solomon's untill the time of that age <a id="l565"></a>should be fulfilled &amp; afterwards they should return from all places of <a id="l566"></a>their captivity &amp; build Ierusalem &amp; the Temple gloriously (Tobit 14.4, 5, 6) <a id="l567"></a>And to express the glory &amp; excellence of this City tis figuratively said to <a id="l568"></a>be built of pretious stones (Tobit 13.16, 17, 18. Isa 54.11, 12. Apoc. 21) &amp; called <a id="l569"></a>the new Ierusalem the heavenly Ierusalem, the Holy City, the Lamb's wife, <a id="l570"></a>the City of the great King, the City into which the Kings of the earth <a id="l571"></a>do bring their glory &amp; honour. And while such a return from Captivity <a id="l572"></a>was the expectation of Israel even before the times of Daniel, I know <a id="l573"></a>not why Daniel should omit it in this Prophesy. This part of the Prophe<a id="l574"></a>sy therefore being not yet fulfilled I attempt not to interpret it, but shal <a id="l575"></a>content my self with observing, that as the 70 weeks &amp; the 62 weeks <a id="l576"></a>were Iewish weeks ending with sabbatical years so the seven weeks <a id="l577"></a>are the compass of a Iubile &amp; begin &amp; end with actions proper for <a id="l578"></a>a Iubile &amp; of the highest  nature for which a Iubile can be kept; <a id="l579"></a>&amp; that since the commandment to rebuild Ierusalem precedes the Messi<a id="l580"></a>ah the Prince 49 years, it may perhaps come forth not from the Iews <a id="l581"></a>themselves but from some other Kingdom friendly to them &amp; precede <a id="l582"></a>their return from Captivity &amp; give occasion to it, &amp; lastly that this rebuilding of Ierusalem &amp; the wast places of Iudah is predicted in Mica. 7.11. Amos 9.11, 14. Ezek 36.33, 35, 36, 38. Isa. 54.3, 11, 12, <a id="l583"></a>&amp; 58.12 &amp; 61.4 &amp; 65 18, 21, 22 &amp; Tobit 14.5 &amp; the return from captivity &amp; coming of the Messiah &amp; his Kingdom are <a id="l584"></a>described in Dan. 7. Apoc. 19 Act. 1. Math 24. Ioel 3. Ezek 36, 37. Isa. 60, <a id="l585"></a>62, 63, 65 &amp; 66 &amp; many other places of scripture. The manner I know <a id="l586"></a>not.

<p id="par48">Know also &amp; understand that from the going forth of the commandment <a id="l603"></a>to build Ierusalem again till the Messiah the Prince [or till his coming as <a id="l604"></a>Prince ] shall be seven weeks.</p>
<p id="par49">Also [till the Messiah] threescore &amp; two weeks   <a id="l606"></a>the wall shall be built again &amp; the street but [this] in troublesome times <a id="l607"></a>&amp; after the threescore &amp; two weeks the Messiah shall  <a id="l608"></a>[not reign as Prince but] be cut off &amp;  [the people or Kingdom] <a id="l609"></a>not be his but the people of a Prince that shall come  shall destroy the city &amp; the sanctuary &amp; the end thereof shall be <a id="l611"></a>which a flood &amp; at the end of the war [untill God's wrath against thy <a id="l612"></a>people shall be fullfilled &amp; they shall return from captivity &amp; rebuild Ierusalem] Desolations are decreed.</p>
<p id="par50">And he [that Prince] shall make a firm covenant which many for a <a id="l613"></a>week   &amp; in half that week [the latter half] <a id="l616"></a>he shall make the Sacrifice &amp; Oblation to cease  &amp; in or upon the sanctuary <a id="l620"></a>shall be the abomination of desolation, &amp; untill the consumation  even that which <a id="l621"></a>is decreed shall be poured upon the desolate. </p>
<p id="par51">In this short Prophesy are foretold the  birth &amp; death &amp; second <a id="l623"></a>coming of Christ &amp; the destruction of  Ierusalem.
