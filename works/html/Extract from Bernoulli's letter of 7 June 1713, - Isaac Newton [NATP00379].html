<h2 id="hd1" class="left">Remarques sur la dispute entre Monsieur de <a id="l1"></a>Leibnitz et Monsieur Newton, touchant l'inven<a id="l2"></a>tion de l'Arithmetique differentiale.</h2>
<p id="par1" class="i0">Ce que bon trouve sur ce sujet dans le Iournal lite<a id="l3"></a>raire de la Hage, et dans nos actes allemans p: 587 <a id="l4"></a>ne s'accorde pas en ses circonstances, et celuy qui <a id="l5"></a>l'a conou n'a pas êté bien instruit.</p>
<p id="par2" class="i0">Monsieur de Liebnitz, et Monsieur Newton jamais n'ont <a id="l6"></a>eu des disputes entre eux sur aucune matiere; Car Mon<a id="l7"></a>sieur Newton n'a jamais fait connoitre vouloir s attri<a id="l8"></a>buer à luy, et disputer à Monsieur de Leibnitz l'inven<a id="l9"></a>tion de l'Arithmetique differentiale.</p>
<p id="par3" class="i0">Monsieur de Leibnitz n'a su, que par le rapport de quel<a id="l10"></a>ques-uns, qui ont lu le Commercium Epistolicum imprimé <a id="l11"></a>à Londres il y a quelque tems, que Monsieur Newton eut <a id="l12"></a>part à une telle injustice, que Monsieur de Leibnitz ê<a id="l13"></a>tant encore à Viénne, et qui n'a pas-encoure vu ce traité <a id="l14"></a>attribue plûtôt à la mauvaise volunté de les envieux ou <a id="l15"></a>des gens ignorans. Aussy n'en a t-il jamais porté ses <a id="l16"></a>plaintes à la Societè Royale en Angleterre, comme super<a id="l17"></a>flu dans une cause si juste: seulement a-t-il pris occa<a id="l18"></a>sion d'écrire à Monsieur le Secretaire de la Societé, qu'il <a id="l19"></a>ne doutoit point, que la Societé A Monsieur Newton mê<a id="l20"></a>me desaprouveroit entieérement un tel procedé. En sor<a id="l21"></a>te que la Societé n'a pas pu examiner les argumens <a id="l22"></a>des deux parties, et prononcer un arrêt definitif.</p>
<p id="par4" class="i0">Voicy la verité du fait: Il y a environ quarante ans, <a id="l23"></a>plus ou moins, que Monsieur de Leibnitz, Oldenbourg, <a id="l24"></a>Newton, Collin's et autres ont eu un Commerce des lettres <a id="l25"></a>entre eux, dont il se trouve quelque chose d'imprimé <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p487v"> &lt;487v&gt; </span> dans la troìsiéme partie des Oeuvres Mathematiques de <a id="l26"></a>Wallisius. Il paroit par les lettres publieês par Wallisius <a id="l27"></a>que Monsieur Newton faìsoìt mystere d'une invention <a id="l28"></a>laquelle il a ensuite debité être l'Arithmetique differen<a id="l29"></a>tiale, au lieu que Monsieur de Leibnitz luy communiquoit <a id="l30"></a>de bonne foi le fonds de cette Arithmétique, quoy qu'il ait <a id="l31"></a>paru du depuis, que Monsieur Newton ne l'avoit pas <a id="l32"></a>bien compris, sur tout ce qui regarde differentias diffe<a id="l33"></a>rentiarum; Aprés cela on a trouve encore d'autres lettres <a id="l34"></a>ecrites entre Collins et Ses Amis, que l'on a fait imprimer <a id="l35"></a>à Londres avec des notes, par lesquelles on pretend prouver <a id="l36"></a>par des conjectures mal fondèes, et par des suppositions faus, <a id="l37"></a>Ses, que Monsieur Newton a inventé l'Arithmetique differen<a id="l38"></a>tiale, et que Monsieur de Leibnitz l'a aprise de luy, non obstant <a id="l39"></a>que le contraire paroit clairement par les lettres de ces deux <a id="l40"></a>Messeurs publiées par Monsieur Wallisius.</p>
<p id="par5" class="i0">L'auteur de ces remarques a jugé trop temerairement de cho<a id="l41"></a>ses qui me luy ont pas êté assés connues; et il a mal reussi à <a id="l42"></a>deviner, par quelle voye Monsieur de Leibnitz est parvenu <a id="l43"></a>à cette invention. Il s'est trouve de plus que Monsieur <a id="l44"></a>Newton n'a pas bién compris la vraye Arithmetique differen<a id="l45"></a>tiale, lors qu'en 1687 il mit au jour Ses Principia Philo<a id="l46"></a>sophiæ naturalis Mathematica, vu qu'il ne s'en est point <a id="l47"></a>servi, lorsqu'il en avoit la meilleux occasion du monde; <a id="l48"></a>mais a même commis des fautes capitales, tout-à-fait <a id="l49"></a>contraires aux principes de l'Arithmetique differentiàle, <a id="l50"></a>comme un Mathematicién entierement impartial a remarqué <a id="l51"></a>le premier. Aussy Monsieur Newton, aprés en avoir été a <a id="l52"></a>verti, a corrigé ces fautes, en faisant changer quelques feil<a id="l53"></a>les dans la nouvelle impression, qui à paru l'année passée. <a id="l54"></a>Monsieur de Leibnitz avoit déja auparant publié son A<a id="l55"></a>rithmetique en l'annee 1684: mais Monsieur Newton n'a <a id="l56"></a>rien donné sur cette matiere, jusqu'à ce qu'en 1693 le <a id="l57"></a>2<sup><em class="underline">me</em></sup> Tome des Oeuvres Mathematiques de Wallisius vit le <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p488r"> &lt;488r&gt; </span> jour, lorsque le systeme de Monsieur de Leibnitz êtoit déja <a id="l58"></a>en reputation par tout, et que partientierement les deux fré<a id="l59"></a>res Messieurs Iaques et Iean Bernoulli en eussent fait pu<a id="l60"></a>bliquement l'essais avec beaucoup d'aplaudissement; ce qui <a id="l61"></a>rendoit sans doute Monsieur Newton /quoyqu'un peu <a id="l62"></a>trop tard:/ Si temeraire pour vouloir y avoir part.</p>
<p id="par6" class="i0">L'en voyoit d'abord ches Wallisius l'invention de Monsieur <a id="l63"></a>de Leibnitz se presenter, mais en d'autres figures et ter<a id="l64"></a>mes plus impropres. Cependant Monsieur Newton n'a<a id="l65"></a>ny alors, ny longtems aprés, eu l'audace, de troubler Mon<a id="l66"></a>sieur de Leibnitz dans la possession de son invention <a id="l67"></a>Et tant que Hugenius et Wallisius, qui êtoient des <a id="l68"></a>Iuges impartiaux, vivoient, lesquels avount des con<a id="l69"></a>noissances â fond de cette affaire, il a bién jugé qu'il <a id="l70"></a>ne reussiroìt pas; C'est pourquoy il a attendu jusqu'<a id="l71"></a>à ce qu'il n'y eut plus personne de ceux, qui puissent <a id="l72"></a>être témoins du progrés de cette science, et qui mêmes <a id="l73"></a>y avoient beaucoup de part, Mais maintenant il a <a id="l74"></a>recours à des novices, qui ignorent ce qui s'est passe <a id="l75"></a>autrefois, et qui jugent selon leurs preoccupations et <a id="l76"></a>leurs sottes passions Un certain Novice s'est vou<a id="l77"></a>lu mettre en reputation, en attaquant Monsieur de <a id="l78"></a>Leibnitz et luy adsersant une espece de defi; Mais <a id="l79"></a>Monsieur de Leibnitz voyant, que cet homme n'êtoit <a id="l80"></a>pas d'humour à se laisser detromper, il n'a pas <a id="l81"></a>voulu s'engager avec luy. Et il a fort bièn fait, car <a id="l82"></a>sans cela il auroit eu un pretexte pour dire, que l'on <a id="l83"></a>avoit les argumens de deux parties, sur lesquels on pou<a id="l84"></a>voit decider; au lieu que les Iuges pretendus n'ont <a id="l85"></a>que les argumens d'un coté seul.</p>
<p id="par7" class="i0">Dans cette vuë l'on a fait imprimer le Commercium <a id="l86"></a>Epistolicum, dans lequel on croit avoir trouvé sur <a id="l87"></a>quoy se fonder, bién qu'il ne s'y trouve rién du tout <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p488v"> &lt;488v&gt; </span> qui puisse decider la dispute du veritable Inventeur <a id="l88"></a>de l'Arithmetique differentiale.

S'il avoit gardé le si<a id="l91"></a>lence, il seroit demeuré participant de l'invention <a id="l92"></a>attendu que Monsieur de Leibnitz avoit cru sur sa <a id="l93"></a>parole, qu'il avoit trouvé quelque chose, qui aprochat <a id="l94"></a>en quelque façon de l'Arithmetique differentiale <a id="l95"></a>Mais presentement se trouve le contraire.</p>
<p id="par8" class="i0">Des Gens entendus et impartiaux ont ris d'une preten<a id="l96"></a>sion si tardive et si mal fondée; et l'on a déja fait <a id="l97"></a>imprimer l'opinion d'un celebre Mathematicièn fondée <a id="l98"></a><span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>h<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>on seulement sur le long silence, mais /: ce qui plus <a id="l99"></a>est./ sur les fautes de Monsieur Newton, lesquelles <a id="l100"></a>prouvent evidemment, qu'il n'a pas seulement <a id="l101"></a>compris ce qu'il pretend avoir inventé avant Mon<a id="l102"></a>sieur de Leibnitz il y a 40 ans.</p>

<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">Remarques upon the dispute between Mons<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; Mons<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l103"></a>touching the invention of the differential  Arithmetique</h2>
<p id="par9">That which is found upon this subject in the Iournal literaire of the Hague <a id="l104"></a>&amp; in our German Acts p. 587 do not agree in their circumstances, &amp; he <a id="l105"></a>that conceived it was not well instructed.</p>
<p id="par10">Mons<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; Mons<sup>r</sup> Newton never had any disputes  <a id="l106"></a>between them about any matter. For Mons<sup>r</sup> Newton never made it known <a id="l107"></a>that he would attribute to himself &amp; dispute with M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the inven<a id="l108"></a>tion of the differential Arithmetique.</p>
<p id="par11">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz knew not but by the report of some who had read <a id="l109"></a>the Commercium Epistolicum printed at London some time ago that <a id="l110"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton had a share in such a piece of injustice, seing that <a id="l111"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leinitz was still at Vienna &amp; had not seen the  <a id="l112"></a>treatise attributed for the most part to the ill will of the <a id="l113"></a> envious  or of ignorant people. So he has not yet sent his com<a id="l114"></a>plaint to the  Royal Society in England as being superfluous <a id="l115"></a>in a cause so just. He only took occasion to write to the <a id="l116"></a>Secretary of the Society that he doubted not at all but the <a id="l117"></a>Society &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Newton himself would entirely disapprove such <a id="l118"></a>a proceeding. So that the Society has not been able  at all to <a id="l119"></a>examine the arguments on both sides &amp; to pronounce a <a id="l120"></a>definitive sentence</p>
<p id="par12">See the truth of the fact. It is about 40 years more or <a id="l121"></a>less that M<sup>rs</sup> Leibnitz Oldenburg Newton Collins &amp; others had <a id="l122"></a>a commerce of Letters with one another<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup></p>

<h2 id="hd3" class="cent">Observations upon  a paper entituled Remarks concerning the difference between <a id="l206"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Newton &amp; upon the translation of a Latine piece <a id="l207"></a>where this judgment is found.</h2>
<p id="par42">  The Latine piece was printed in Germany in the form of a defa<a id="l208"></a>matory Libel in August last without  the name of any author, the Letters <a id="l209"></a>L—s  &amp; N—s being put for Leibnitius &amp; Newtonus. And being void of <a id="l210"></a>argument &amp; full of reflexions without any proof was judged too mean <a id="l211"></a>a piece to deserve any answer. But being  sent to the Hague to <a id="l212"></a>be reprinted in your Iournal, I send you the following Observations upon <a id="l213"></a>it. </p>
<p id="par43">1  The author of the Latin piece tells  us that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz being <a id="l214"></a>at Vienna had not yet seen the Commercium Epistolicum. And this <a id="l215"></a>he could not know without keeping a correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz. <a id="l216"></a>He tells us further that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz not being at leisure to examin this affair <a id="l217"></a>himself he had referred it to the judgment of a  Mathematician <a id="l218"></a>of the first rank &amp; very skilful in these things, &amp; very free from partiality. So then <a id="l219"></a> this paper was writ by <a id="l220"></a>the correspondents of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself was <a id="l221"></a>the first mover. And therefore it must be looked upon as the ablest <a id="l222"></a>defence that he &amp; his correspondents were able to make. We are <a id="l223"></a>indeed told that he had not yet seen the Commercium. But a Copy of <a id="l224"></a>it was sent to him by the Resident of the Elector of Hannover <a id="l225"></a>&amp; another was sent to Lipsic for him &amp; an answer came back thence to <a id="l226"></a>the  Secretary of the R. S. that it was sent to him.  <a id="l227"></a>He knew how to write to a great Mathematician who had the book <a id="l228"></a>And those in England who have seen the Latin Paper generally con<a id="l229"></a>clude from the style &amp; humour of it that it was writ by M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l230"></a>Leibnitz himself. Now this author tells us that the great Mathematician having <a id="l231"></a>dicussed all things gave judgment in his Letters of 7 Iune 1713 as follows</p>
<p id="par44">Obs. 2. The whole Latin paper is full of assertions &amp; reflexi<a id="l232"></a>ons without any proof  whereas  <a id="l233"></a>by the laws of all nations M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz cannot be a witness for him <a id="l234"></a>self.  He &amp; his friends ought to prove what they assert. <a id="l235"></a>For there cannot be a greater argument of a bad cause then <a id="l236"></a>to affirm &amp; reflect without being able to prove any thing.</p>
<p id="par45">Obs. 3. The author of the Latin paper saith that M<sup>r</sup> Hook <a id="l237"></a>complained of M<sup>r</sup> Newton about the Hypothesis of the Planets &amp; <a id="l238"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Flamsteed about the use of his Observations. And indeed M<sup>r</sup> Hook <a id="l239"></a>claimed the invention of the <span class="hspac-n" title="6 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>  Proposition of the 1<sup>st</sup> book of the Princi<a id="l240"></a>pia but could never produce  Demonstration &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz has <a id="l241"></a>produced an erroneous demonstration of the same Proposition to make it <a id="l242"></a>his own. Whether M<sup>r</sup> Flamsteed treated M<sup>r</sup> Newton with candour is better <a id="l243"></a>known here than in Germany &amp; whether M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz or M<sup>r</sup> Tschurn<a id="l244"></a>hause were in the right when they fell out about an invention is not <a id="l245"></a>material to us in England.</p>
<p id="par46"> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p492v"> &lt;492v&gt; </span> infinitarum convergentium, had he but repeated the word <em class="underline">ut</em> in the next <a id="l250"></a>sentence as the sense requires, the Objection would have been at an end.</p>
<p id="par47">2 Obs. 5. But the great Mathematician  He conjectures that M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l251"></a>spent his first years in cultivating the method of  series without thinking of <a id="l252"></a>the calculus of fluxions, or reducing it to general rules. That is, he will <a id="l253"></a>not allow plain matter of fact. In the Analysis which D<sup>r</sup> Barrow  in <a id="l254"></a>the year 1669 communicated to M<sup>r</sup>  Collins the method of fluxions is <a id="l255"></a>described with examples of the calculus.  &amp; there is no proof that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz knew any thing <a id="l257"></a>of the method before the year 1677.</p>
<p id="par48">3 But the great Mathematician brings two arguments for his conjecture 1 <a id="l258"></a>first saith he in all the Letters published in the Commercium Epistolicum  &amp; in all his Principia  Philosophiæ the letters with pricks  which M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l260"></a>Newton now uses are not to be met with.  And by the same argumenthe may conclude that the Ancients had no Analysis because they wrote by composition. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz indeed <a id="l262"></a>confines his method to the symbols dx &amp; dy so that if you take away his <a id="l263"></a>symbols you take away his method, M<sup>r</sup> Newton doth not so. And whether <a id="l264"></a>he uses Letters with pricks or other symbols his method is still the same <a id="l265"></a>In his Letter of 24 Octob 1676 he represents that he had a method of extracting <a id="l266"></a>fluents out of equations involving their fluxions. Will M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz say that <a id="l267"></a>he had no such method  unless he then used letters with pricks. If so <a id="l268"></a>his letters with pricks  are as old at least as the year 1676 &amp; by consequence older <a id="l269"></a>then the differential notes of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz.</p>
<p id="par49">4 But its to be observed that fluxions &amp;  differences are not quantities of the <a id="l270"></a>same kind. Fluxions are  velocities,  differences are  small <a id="l271"></a>parts of things generated by fluxion in moments of time. Fluxions are finite <a id="l272"></a>quantities differences are infinitely little.  M<sup>r</sup> Newton  sometimes uses <a id="l273"></a>prickt letters sometimes other marks for fluxions,  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz uses no symbols for fluxions <a id="l274"></a> to this day. The symbols of fluxions therefore used <a id="l275"></a>by M<sup>r</sup> Newton are the oldest in the kind. These he multiplies by the letter <a id="l276"></a>o to make them infinitely little moments or differences.</p>
<p id="par50">5  His second reason is that M<sup>r</sup> Newton understood not the  <a id="l277"></a>differences of differences or second differences till after the writing of his <a id="l278"></a>Principia. For there, saith he, the constant increase of the letter x <a id="l279"></a>he represents not by a prickt letter as at present but by the letter o <a id="l280"></a>after the vulgar manner which destroys the advantages of the differential <a id="l281"></a>calculus. But that M<sup>r</sup> Newton understood it  many years before <a id="l282"></a>is manifest by his Letter dated 10 Decem 1672 wherein he represents <a id="l283"></a>that his method extended to  Questions about the Curvature of Curves. <a id="l284"></a> And as for the  letter o, M<sup>r</sup> Newton used it in his <a id="l285"></a>Analysis communicated to M<sup>r</sup> Collins in the year 1669, &amp; in his book of <a id="l286"></a>Quadratures where he  represents fluxions by prickt letters &amp; <a id="l287"></a>still uses it as the best way of notation. And I recommend it to be <a id="l288"></a>still used in honour  of M<sup>r</sup> Fermat who made the first <a id="l289"></a>step towards this  sort of calculus. Know therefore that M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l290"></a> puts a known quantity &amp; most commonly an unit for the fluxion <a id="l291"></a>of time &amp; considered as the exponent of time.  the letter o or <span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-4-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mn>1</mn><mo>&amp;#xD7;</mo><mn>o</mn></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-18" style="width: 2.194em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 2.255em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.589em, 1002.23em, 2.652em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-19"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-20" style="font-family: MathJax_Main;">1</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-21" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.222em;">×</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-22" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.222em;">o</span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.072em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 0.781em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>1</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>o</mn></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-4"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>1</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>o</mn></math></script> he puts for its moment, &amp; for the <a id="l295"></a>moments of other flowing quantities he puts  the rectangles under <a id="l296"></a>their fluxions &amp; the moment o,  borrowing the names of fluxions &amp; <a id="l297"></a>moments from the fluxion &amp; moments of time. And This sort of Notation <a id="l298"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton used when he wrote his Analysis above mentioned,   <a id="l299"></a> <a id="l300"></a>but D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in his method of Tangents published A C. 1670 put the letters a &amp; e for the <a id="l301"></a>differences of the Abscissas &amp; Ordinates &amp; m<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz seven years after <a id="l302"></a>  changed the letters a <a id="l303"></a>&amp; e into the symbols dy &amp; dx,  &amp; called it the differential method beginning where D<sup>r</sup> <a id="l306"></a>Barrow left off as that candid Gentleman the Marquess de L'Hospital <a id="l307"></a> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p493r"> &lt;493r&gt; </span> observed long since in the Preface to his  Analysis. And whereas our Geome<a id="l308"></a>ter represents that M<sup>r</sup> Newton uses the letter o  in a vulgar <a id="l309"></a>manner which destroys the advantages of the differential calculus the method of <a id="l310"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton has all the advantages of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; is more universal <a id="l311"></a>&amp; more Geometrical.</p>
<p id="par51">The grand Geometer adds that M<sup>r</sup> Newton has given a false rule about <a id="l312"></a>the higher degrees of Differences. But it seems this great Artist had not skill <a id="l313"></a>enough  in these matters to mend a press-fault. For in the Scholium at the end <a id="l314"></a>of the book of Quadratures where M<sup>r</sup> Newton saith: Hæ fluxiones sunt ut <a id="l315"></a>termini serierum infinitarum convergentium, had he but repeated the word ut <a id="l316"></a>in the next sentence as the sence requires the Objection would have been at an end. And thus much <a id="l317"></a>in answer to the judgment of the great Mathematician [All which amounts to <a id="l318"></a> nothing more then this that M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l320"></a>Leibnitz appeals  to himself from the records published by <a id="l321"></a>order of the R. S. In his Letter to  their Secretary dated 29 Decem <a id="l322"></a> 1711 he wrote that  what M<sup>r</sup> Keil wrote opposed his candor <a id="l323"></a>which that he should defend at that age after so many documents of his life no prudent <a id="l324"></a>or just man would approve of: which is as much as to say that the Royal Society <a id="l325"></a>were unjust unless they would admitt him to be a witness in his own cause, <a id="l326"></a>contrary to the laws of all nations.  By]</p>
<p id="par52"> The Author of the paper pretends that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz never commu<a id="l327"></a>nicated his reasons to the Society. And so the Society did not examin the reason <a id="l328"></a>on both sides for giving judgment. Whereas M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz refused to give <a id="l329"></a> his reasons calling it unjust to expect that one of his age &amp; reputation <a id="l331"></a>should defend his candour. That is, he insisted upon  being a witness <a id="l332"></a>for himself, contrary to the laws of all nations.  And when he <a id="l333"></a>would give no reasons, the Society appointed a Committee to search <a id="l334"></a>records &amp; make a report   <a id="l335"></a>thereof. And now to talk of reasons against  matter of fact, &amp; to <a id="l336"></a>do it without producing  those reasons is very trifling. The Report of the Commit<a id="l337"></a>te must stand till M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz produces his reasons against it if he has any.</p>
<p id="par53"> The author of the paper in the next place pretends to give  <a id="l338"></a>a true report of what passed.  But begins his report with what passed <a id="l339"></a>in the years before. </p>

<div><span class="pagenumber" id="p494r"> &lt;494r&gt; </span>
<p id="par62">I have seen in your journal the translation of a Latin piece dated 29 Iuly 1713 <a id="l350"></a>&amp; published in Germany, &amp; the Remarks upon it. These pieces are full of assertions <a id="l351"></a>without proof &amp; without the name of the author &amp; so are of no authority.</p>
<p id="par63">The author of the Latine piece represents that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had not then <a id="l352"></a>seen the Commercium Epistolicum, &amp; this he could not know without keeping a <a id="l353"></a>correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz. But a copy of this book was sent to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l354"></a>Leibnitz by the Resident of the Elector of Hannover above a year ago &amp; <a id="l355"></a>several other copies were then sent to Lipic one of which was for him.</p>
<p id="par64">That Author tells us further that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz not being at leasure <a id="l356"></a>to examin this affair himself had referred it to the judgment of a Mathe<a id="l357"></a>matician of the first rank very skilfull in these things &amp; very free from partiality. <a id="l358"></a>So then this paper was writ by the correspondents of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp;  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself desiring the judgment of the great Mathematician &amp; sending it to his correspondent to be published was the first mover &amp; that the credit of the Mathe<a id="l360"></a>matician for candor &amp; ability depends upon the credit of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz. And <a id="l361"></a>for these reasons this paper must be looked upon as the best defence that <a id="l362"></a>he &amp; his correspondents were able to make: especially if this paper be writ <a id="l363"></a>in the stile of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself as some think. By his Letters against <a id="l364"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Keill it appears that he is too much concerned to neglect this matter, <a id="l365"></a>&amp; his appealing from a numerous Committee of the Royall Society to a <a id="l366"></a>nameless Mathematician of his own chusing is no better then appealing <a id="l367"></a>to himself. For he has wrote to the Society that it would be injustice to <a id="l368"></a>question his candour, that is, to deny him to be both witness &amp; Iudge in his own cause.</p>
<p id="par65">Now this great Mathematician conjectures that M<sup>r</sup> Newton spent his <a id="l369"></a>first years in cultivating the method of series without thinking of the  <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ca<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>lculus of fluxions or reducing it to general rules. That is he will not <a id="l371"></a>allow the Analysis communicated by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> Collins in the <a id="l372"></a>year 1669 to be a genuine piece. And he brings too arguments for his <a id="l373"></a>conjecture.</p>
<p id="par66">First, saith he, in all the Letters published in the Commercium Epistolicum <a id="l374"></a>&amp; in all the Principia Philosophiæ, the letters with pricks which M<sup>r</sup> Newton now <a id="l375"></a>uses are not to be met with. But in all those Letters (except the Analysis) &amp; in all <a id="l376"></a>the Principia there was no occasion to make use of  the fluxional <a id="l377"></a>calculus. And D<sup>r</sup> Keill hath given a further Answer to this argument long <a id="l378"></a>since in his Letter dated 24 May 1711. <em class="underline">Observo ipsum Newtonum</em>, saith he, <a id="l379"></a><em class="underline">sæpius mutassæ nomen et notationem calculi. In tractatu de Analysi <a id="l380"></a>Æquationum per series infinitas, incrementum abscissæ per literam o de<a id="l381"></a>signat, et in principijs Philosophiæ, Fluentem quantitatem Genitam vocat <a id="l382"></a>ejusque incrementum Momentum appellat: illam literis majoribus A vel B, <a id="l383"></a>hoc minusculis a et b designat</em>. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz confines his Method to the symbols <a id="l384"></a>dx &amp; dy, so that if you take away his symbols you take away  his method. M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l385"></a>Newton doth not confine his method in such a manner. As he uses a propriety of any symbols <a id="l386"></a>for fluents so he uses any others for fluxions, &amp; whether he uses letters <a id="l387"></a>with pricks or other symbols for fluxions his method is still the same. In <a id="l388"></a>his Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 he represents that he had a  method of extracting <a id="l389"></a>Fluents out of equations involving their fluxions. Will M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz say <a id="l390"></a>that he had no such method unless he then used letters with pricks? If <a id="l391"></a>so, his letters with pricks must be allowed as old at least as the year <a id="l392"></a>1676, &amp; by consequence older then the differential Notes of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz.</p>
<p id="par67">But its further to be observed that Fluxions &amp; Differences are not quantities <a id="l393"></a>of the same kind. Fluxions are velocities, &amp; Differences are  <a id="l394"></a>small parts of things generated by fluxion in moments of time: fluxions <a id="l395"></a>are always finite quantities &amp; differences are infinitely little. M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l396"></a>uses sometimes prickt letters sometimes other symbols for fluxions, M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p494v"> &lt;494v&gt; </span> uses no symbols for fluxions to this day. The symbols of fluxions used by <a id="l397"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton whether with pricks or without, are  therefore the <a id="l398"></a>oldest in the kind. These he multiplies by the moment o to make them <a id="l399"></a><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup>infinitely little &amp; puts the rectangles for moments  of the Moments, &amp; with<a id="l400"></a>out the moment o either exprest or understood they never signify <a id="l401"></a>moments or differences, but are always finite quantities &amp; signify velo<a id="l402"></a>cities. The fluxion of time or of any exponent of time he usually <a id="l403"></a>represents by an unit, &amp; the moment thereof by the letter o.</p>
<p id="par68">The second reason of the great Mathematician for his conjecture is <a id="l404"></a>that M<sup>r</sup> Newton understood not the differences of differences till after the <a id="l405"></a>writing of his Principia. For there, saith he, the constant increase of the letter <a id="l406"></a>x he represents not by a prickt letter as at present but by the letter o <a id="l407"></a>after the vulgar manner, which destroys the advantages of the differential <a id="l408"></a>method. Here our great Mathematician commits two mistakes; one by <a id="l409"></a>supposing that M<sup>r</sup> Newton represents differences by prickt letters, ano<a id="l410"></a>ther by supposing that the method used in the tenth Proposition of the <a id="l411"></a>second Book of the Principia is M<sup>r</sup> Newtons method of fluxions. <a id="l412"></a>Tis only a branch of his method of converging series. In his Letter <a id="l413"></a>dated 10<sup>th</sup> Decemb. 1672, where he speaks of a method whereof the <a id="l414"></a>method of Tangents there described is a branch or Corollary, he re<a id="l415"></a>presents that this method (which is the method of fluxions) extended to <a id="l416"></a>Questions about the curvature of curves; &amp; thence it is manifest <a id="l417"></a>that he then understood the second fluxions or differences of differences.</p>
<p id="par69">The letter o was used by M<sup>r</sup> Newton in the manner above <a id="l418"></a><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup>mentioned in his Analysis communicated by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> Collins in <a id="l419"></a>the year 1669, &amp; in his Book of Quadratures &amp; is still used by him in the <a id="l420"></a>very same manner. And as it is the oldest notation for moments or <a id="l421"></a>differences so it is the best, the method being thereby more convenient  <a id="l422"></a>more elegant &amp; more suitable to Geometry then by the differential notation <a id="l423"></a>&amp; as universal, &amp; does justice to the memory of M<sup>r</sup> F<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>rmat who first <a id="l424"></a>a <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>inmadnit<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> brought in the use of this letter o.</p>

M<sup>r</sup> Newtons notation of this kind is also much the oldest.</p>
<p id="par71">D<sup>r</sup> Barrow published his method of Tangents in the year 1670, &amp; <a id="l428"></a><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup>that very candid Gentleman the Marquess de l'Hospital, in the Preface <a id="l429"></a>to his Analysis, represents that D<sup>r</sup> Barrow stopt at fractions &amp; surds, <a id="l430"></a>&amp; where D<sup>r</sup> Barrow left off M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz began. His method of <a id="l431"></a>Tangents is the same with D<sup>r</sup> Barrows except that he has changed <a id="l432"></a>his letters a &amp; e into the symbols dx &amp; dy, &amp;  (being admonished <a id="l433"></a>by M<sup>r</sup> Newtons Letters of 10 Decem. 1672, 13 Iune 1676 &amp; 24 Octob. 1676) <a id="l434"></a><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup>taught how to avoyd fractions &amp; surds.</p>
<p id="par72">As to what the Author of the Latin paper saith of M<sup>r</sup> Hook <a id="l435"></a>&amp; M<sup>r</sup> Flamsteed: M<sup>r</sup> Hook indeed claimed one of M<sup>r</sup> Newton's Pro<a id="l436"></a>positions but could never produce a Demonstration thereof, M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l437"></a>Leibnitz claimed it also but the Demonstration by which he claimed <a id="l438"></a>it is erroneous. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz claimed also an Invention from M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l439"></a>Tschurnhause &amp; who is in the right may be a question, but M<sup>r</sup> Newton always acknowledged the use of M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l440"></a> Flamsteads Observations.</p>
<p id="par73">This Author in the next place complains of the Committee of <a id="l441"></a>the R. Society for representing that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had from M<sup>r</sup> Iames <a id="l442"></a>Gregory the series for finding the Arc of a circle by the Tangent given, <a id="l443"></a>that is, he represents that the Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Gregory, M<sup>r</sup> Collins, M<sup>r</sup> Olden<a id="l444"></a>burg &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnits examined &amp; approved by a numerous Committee <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p495r"> &lt;495r&gt; </span> of the Royal Society were fourged.

Society &amp; conteins his acknowledgment of the Receipt of M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburghs <a id="l453"></a>Letter above mentioned. It begins thus. <em class="underline">Literas tuas multa fruge Algebraica <a id="l454"></a>refertas accepi pro quibus tibi et doctissimo Collinio gratias ago. Cum nunc præter <a id="l455"></a>ordinarias curas Mechanicis imprimis negotijs distrahar, non potui examinare <a id="l456"></a>series quas misistis, ac cum meis comparare.</em> By these words its plain that <a id="l457"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  at this time knew none of the series then sent <a id="l458"></a>him to be his own, tho before the end of  the year he communi<a id="l459"></a>cated to his friends at Paris one of those series then sent him as his own, viz<sup>t</sup> <a id="l460"></a>that of Gregory then dead, &amp; by vertue of that communication has ever since <a id="l461"></a>claimed it as his own. The collection of the papers of M<sup>r</sup> Gregory made by <a id="l462"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Collins after the death of that Gentleman, is still extant in the hand-<a id="l463"></a>writing of M<sup>r</sup> Collins, &amp; at the request of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was sent to Paris in <a id="l464"></a>Iune 1676, &amp; conteins  a copy of the aforesaid Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Gregory. But <a id="l465"></a>upon the death of that Gentleman M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz pretended in his Letter <a id="l466"></a>dated 28 Decem. 1675 that he had communicated it at Paris above two years <a id="l467"></a>before &amp; that it was the series whereof he had wrote before to M<sup>r</sup> Olden<a id="l468"></a>burg, that is, in his Letter of 15 Iuly &amp; 24 Octob. 1674. And under this pre<a id="l469"></a>tence he sent it back to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg as his own in his Letter dated <a id="l470"></a>27 Aug. 1676.  And yet the Series which he wrote of in his said two Letters <a id="l471"></a>dated 15 Iuly &amp;  24 Octob 1674 was not this Series for finding <a id="l472"></a>the arc by the tangent but a Theoreme or Method for finding the Arc by <a id="l473"></a>the sine. This Theoreme or Series M<sup>r</sup> Collins had received from M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l474"></a>in Iuly 1669 &amp; communicated it soon after to his friends very freely. M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l475"></a>Leibnitz was in London in the years 1671, 1672 &amp; the beginning of 1673 <a id="l476"></a>&amp; having met with this series either in London or soon after in France <a id="l477"></a>pretended in his said Letters of 15 Iuly &amp; 24 Octob 1674 to have found it <a id="l478"></a>himself, &amp; yet in his Letter dated 12 May 1676 desired M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg to <a id="l479"></a>procure from M<sup>r</sup> Collins the Demonstration thereof, that is, the method of <a id="l480"></a>finding it. And when he had received the method with some of M<sup>r</sup> Newtons <a id="l481"></a>series, he pretended to have found three of those series before, tho he did not <a id="l482"></a>yet understand the method of finding them. For in his Letter of 27 Aug. <a id="l483"></a>1676, he wrote back for a further explication of the method. M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l484"></a>therefore in his Letter of <sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> 24 Aug. 1676 explained it further &amp; added another <a id="l485"></a>method of the same kind, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Letter dated 21 Iune 1677 <a id="l486"></a>still desired a further explication,  but so soon as he understood it, he <a id="l487"></a>wrote in his Letter dated  12 Iuly 1677 that he found by his old <a id="l488"></a>papers, that he had used one of those methods before.

For in his <a id="l495"></a>Letter dated 27 Aug. 1676, he wrote: <em class="underline">Quod dicere videmini plerasque difficultates <a id="l496"></a>(exceptis Problematibus Diophantæis) ad series infinitas reduci, id mihi non videtur. <a id="l497"></a>Sunt enim multa usque adeo mira et implexa ut neque ab æquationibus pen<a id="l498"></a>deant neque ex quadraturis.

I pass by his claiming the Inventions of Mouton &amp; Paschal &amp; a con<a id="l504"></a>siderable part of M<sup>r</sup> Newton's Principia Philosophiæ.</p>
<p id="par74">Our Author tells us further that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz published in the Acta Eru<a id="l505"></a>ditorum a general method for finding the Ordinates of transcendent Curve not by <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p495v"> &lt;495v&gt; </span> extraction of roots but deduced from a profounder foundation of the <a id="l506"></a>differential calculus, by which the business of Series was brought to a <a id="l507"></a>greater degree of perfection. But M<sup>r</sup> Newton many years before <a id="l508"></a>(viz<sup>t</sup> in his Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg dated 24 Octob. 1676, communi<a id="l509"></a>cated the very same method in this sentence. <em class="underline">Altera</em> [methodus <a id="l510"></a>consistit] tantum in assumptione seriei pro quantitate qualibet incognita <a id="l511"></a>ex qua cætera commode derivari possint, &amp; in collatione terminorum <a id="l512"></a>homologorum æquationis resultantis ad eruendos terminos assumptæ <a id="l513"></a>seriei. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz therefore has no title to any part of the method <a id="l514"></a>of converging series.</p>
<p id="par75">Our Author tells us further that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was the first <a id="l515"></a>who used the exponential calculus while M<sup>r</sup> Newton knew nothing there<a id="l516"></a>of. Certainly M<sup>r</sup> Newton was one of the first who introduced into Analysis <a id="l517"></a>fractions radicals &amp; negative quantities for the indices or exponents of dignities <a id="l518"></a>&amp; thereby very much enlarged Analysis &amp; laid the i<span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 4 characters)">{illeg}</span> foundation of <a id="l519"></a>making it universal. In his Letter dated 24 Octob. 1676 he mention<a id="l520"></a>ed such Exponents of Dignities &amp; thereupon M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Answer dated 21 Iune 1677, proposed indeterminate exponents of Dignities. And this seems to have been the Ori<a id="l521"></a>ginal of the Exponential Calculus. But such a calculus has hitherto <a id="l522"></a>been of no use. a <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span>la<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>r<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>t s'a<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>n<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> trouvé n'a<span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 2 characters)">{illeg}</span>in ana<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>mar<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>age</p>
<p id="par76">Our Author tells us also that the English &amp; Scotch, Wallis, Hook, New<a id="l523"></a>ton &amp; Gregory junior, acknowledged 36 years ago the series for finding <a id="l524"></a>the arc of a circle by the Tangent to be the invention of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l525"></a>That is, he complains of M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg for not letting the English <a id="l526"></a>&amp; Scotch know that he had sent this series with several others to <a id="l527"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in April 1675. Tis sufficient that the Letters between M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l528"></a>Oldenburg &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz were left by M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg in the Letter-<a id="l529"></a>book of the R.

<p id="par77">And thus much concerning the printed paper.</p>

<p id="par81">I have seen in your Iournal Literaire the translation of a Latin <a id="l543"></a>piece dated 29 Iuly 1713 &amp; published in Germany &amp; the Remarks upon it <a id="l544"></a>These pieces are full of assertions without any proof &amp; without the name of <a id="l545"></a>the Author &amp; so are of no credit or authority.</p>
<p id="par82">The Author of the Latine piece represents that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had not <a id="l546"></a>then seen the Commercium Epistolicum: &amp; this he could not know without <a id="l547"></a>keeping a correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz. Certainly a Copy of this book <a id="l548"></a>was sent to him by the Resident of the Elector of Hannover above a <a id="l549"></a>year ago, &amp; several other Copies were sent to Leipsic one of which was <a id="l550"></a>for him, &amp; he knew how to write to a friend who had a copy</p>
<p id="par83">For this Author tells us further that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz not being at <a id="l551"></a> leasure to examin this affair himself had referred it to the judg<a id="l552"></a>ment of a Mathematician of the first rank very skilfull in these <a id="l553"></a>things &amp; very free from partiality. So then this paper was writ by the <a id="l554"></a>Correspondents of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself was the first <a id="l555"></a>mover, &amp; the credit of the Mathematician for candor &amp; ability depends <a id="l556"></a>upon the credit of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz. And for these reasons this paper must be <a id="l557"></a>looked upon as the best defence that he &amp; his correspondents were able to <a id="l558"></a>make, especially if the Latin paper be writ in the style of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l559"></a>himself as some think. By his Letters against M<sup>r</sup> Keil it appears that <a id="l560"></a>he is too much concerned to neglect this matter, &amp; his appealing from the <a id="l561"></a>Report of a numerous Committee of the Royal Society to a nameless Ma<a id="l562"></a>thematician of his own chusing is no better then appealing to himself <a id="l563"></a>He has told the R. Society that it would be injustice to question his candor <a id="l564"></a>that is, to deny him to be a witness in his own cause, &amp; now he is for make<a id="l565"></a>ing himself also the Iudge.</p>
<p id="par84">Now the great Mathematician conjectures that M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l566"></a>spent his first years in cultivating the method of series without thinking <a id="l567"></a>of the calculus of fluxions or reducing it to general Rules. That is, <a id="l568"></a>he will not allow the Analysis communicated by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> Col<a id="l569"></a>lins in the year 1669 to be a genuine piece. And he brings too Argu<a id="l570"></a>ments for his conjecture</p>
<p id="par85">First, saith he, in all the Letters published in the Commercium <a id="l571"></a>Epistolicum, &amp; in all the Principia Philosophiæ, the Letters with pricks which <a id="l572"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton now uses are not to be met with. But in all those Letters <a id="l573"></a>except the Analysis, &amp; in all the Principia there was no occasion to <a id="l574"></a>make use of the fluxional calculus. And D<sup>r</sup> Keill hath given a further Answer <a id="l575"></a>to this argument long since in his Letter dated 24 May  1711. Observo <a id="l576"></a>ipsum Newtonum, saith he, sæpius mutasse nomen et notationem calculi. In <a id="l577"></a>Tractatu de Analysi Æquationum per series infinitas, incrementum Abscissæ <a id="l578"></a>per literam o designat, et in Principijs Philosophiæ, Fluentem quantitatem <a id="l579"></a>Genitam vocat, ejusque incrementum Momentum appellat: illam literis <a id="l580"></a>majoribus A vel B, hoc minusculis a et b designat.  I may add <a id="l581"></a>that in one &amp; the same book, the Book of Quadratures he sometimes uses prickt <a id="l582"></a>letters sometimes not. For in the Introduction to that book where he describes his <a id="l583"></a>Method of fluxions &amp; illustrates it with examples he makes no use of prickt <a id="l584"></a>letters. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz confines his method to the symbols dx &amp; dy, so that if <a id="l585"></a>you take away his symbols you take away the characteristick of his method. M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l586"></a>Newton doth not so. Whether  he uses Letters with pricks or other symbols <a id="l587"></a>for fluxions, his method is still the same. In his Letter of 24 Octob. 1676, he <a id="l588"></a>represents that he had a method of extracting fluents out of Equations involving <a id="l589"></a>their fluxions. Will M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz say that he had no such method unless he then <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p496v"> &lt;496v&gt; </span> used letters with pricks? If so, his letters with pricks are as old at <a id="l590"></a>least as the year 1676, &amp; by consequence older then the differential <a id="l591"></a>notes of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz.</p>
<p id="par86">But its to be observed that Fluxions &amp; Differences are not quantities <a id="l592"></a>of the same kind. Fluxions are velocities: Differences are small parts of <a id="l593"></a>things generated by fluxion in moments of time. Fluxions are always <a id="l594"></a>finite quantities: Differences are infinitely little. M<sup>r</sup> Newton uses some<a id="l595"></a>times prickt letters, sometimes other symbols for fluxions: M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l596"></a>uses no symbols for fluxions to this day. The symbols of fluxions <a id="l597"></a>used by M<sup>r</sup> Newton whether with pricks or without are therefor<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l598"></a>the oldest in the kind. These he multiplies by the moment o to make <a id="l599"></a>them infinitely little, &amp; puts the rectangles for moments of fluent <a id="l600"></a>quantities: &amp; without the moment o either exprest or understood the <a id="l601"></a>prickt letters never signify moments or differences but are always finite <a id="l602"></a>quantities &amp; signify velocities. The fluxion of time or of any exponent <a id="l603"></a>of time he usually represents by an unit &amp; the moment thereof by <a id="l604"></a>the Letter o which is equipollent to the rectangle <span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-8-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mn>1</mn><mo>&amp;#xD7;</mo><mn>o</mn></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-82" style="width: 2.194em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 2.255em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.589em, 1002.23em, 2.652em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-83"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-84" style="font-family: MathJax_Main;">1</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-85" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.222em;">×</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-86" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.222em;">o</span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.072em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 0.781em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>1</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>o</mn></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-8"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>1</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>o</mn></math></script>. In his Analysis <a id="l605"></a>above mentioned he represents fluents  by the areas of curves, fluxi<a id="l606"></a>ons by their ordinates &amp; moments  by the rectangles under the ordi<a id="l607"></a>nates &amp; the moment of the common Abscissa. And these rectangles he <a id="l608"></a>uses instead of the Indivisibles of Cavallerius, &amp; thereby makes his <a id="l609"></a>method Geometrical. For in Geometry there are no Indivisibles. When <a id="l610"></a>he is demonstrating any Proposition he always writes down the moment <a id="l611"></a>o &amp; takes it in the sense of the vulgar for an indefinitely small  <a id="l612"></a>part of time &amp; performs the whole calculation in finite figures by the <a id="l613"></a>Geometry of the Ancients without any approximation, &amp; so soon as the <a id="l614"></a>calculation is ended &amp; the Equation reduced he supposes the moment o <a id="l615"></a>to decrease in infinitum &amp; vanish. Examples of this you have in <a id="l616"></a>the end of his Analysis &amp; in the first Proposition of his Book of <a id="l617"></a>Quadratures. But when he is not demonstrating but only investigating <a id="l618"></a>a Proposition, he supposes the moment o to be infinitely small &amp; usu<a id="l619"></a>ally for making dispatch neglects to write it down &amp; proceeds in the <a id="l620"></a>calculation by any approximations which he thinks will create no error <a id="l621"></a>in the conclusion. But this last way (to which the Differential method <a id="l622"></a>is equipollent) is not Geometrical. For Geometry admits not of approx<a id="l623"></a>imations nor of lines &amp; figures  infinitely little.</p>
<p id="par87">The second reason of the great Mathematician for his conjecture <a id="l624"></a>is that M<sup>r</sup> Newton understood not the differences of differences till <a id="l625"></a>after the writing of his Principia. For there saith he the constant <a id="l626"></a>increase of the letter x he represents not by a prickt letter as <a id="l627"></a>at present but by the letter o after the vulgar manner which destroys <a id="l628"></a>the advantages of the differential method. But here our great Ma<a id="l629"></a>thematician commits two mistakes: one in supposing that M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l630"></a>represents Differences by prickt letters, the other by supposing that <a id="l631"></a>the method used in the  Scholium  the 10<sup>th</sup> <a id="l632"></a>Proposition of the second Book of the Principia, is M<sup>r</sup> Newtons method <a id="l633"></a>of Fluxions. Tis only a branch of his method of converging series. The <a id="l634"></a>elements of his method of fluxions he described in the second Lemma of the se<a id="l635"></a>cond book of his Principles &amp; subjoyned this Scholium. <em class="underline">In literis quæ mihi cum <a id="l636"></a>Geometra peritissimo G.

Leibnitio annis abhinc decem intercedebant, cum <a id="l637"></a>significarem me compotem esse methodi determinandi maximas et minimas, <a id="l638"></a>ducendi Tangentes et similia peragendi quæ in terminis surdis æque ac in <a id="l639"></a>rationalibus procederet, &amp; literis transpositis hanc sententiam involventalibus</em> [Data <a id="l640"></a>æquatione quotcunque Fluentes quantitates involvente, Fluxiones invenire &amp; vice <a id="l641"></a>versa] <em class="underline">eandem celarem; rescripsit Vir Clarissimus se quoque in ejusmodi metho<a id="l642"></a>dum incidisse &amp; methodum suam communicavit a mea vix abludentem præterquam <a id="l643"></a>in verborum et notarum formulis. Vtriusque fundamentum continetur in hoc Lemmate.</em> <a id="l644"></a>The Letter here referred unto is that of 24 Octob. 1676 printed by D<sup>r</sup> Wallis. In <a id="l645"></a>this Letter M<sup>r</sup> Newton distinguishes between the Method of infinite series &amp; that of <a id="l646"></a>fluxions &amp; represents that he had writ a treatise of both these methods five years <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p497r"> &lt;497r&gt; </span> before &amp; that the method of fluxions readily gives the method of Tangents of <a id="l647"></a>Slusius &amp; sticks not at equations affected with radicals.  And in a Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Collins dated 10 Decem 1672 M<sup>r</sup> Newton writing <a id="l649"></a>of the method whereof the Method of tangents of Slusius is a branch or <a id="l650"></a>Corollary &amp; which sticks not at  surds, &amp; which by consequence was the <a id="l651"></a>Method of fluxions, represented it a very general method reaching to the <a id="l652"></a>abstruser sorts of Problemes &amp; among others to the determining of the <a id="l653"></a>Curvature of Curves, a Probleme which requires the consideration of the <a id="l654"></a>second fluxions. And therefore he had then extended the method to the <a id="l655"></a>second fluxions or fluxions of fluxions. And it is further observable <a id="l656"></a>that M<sup>r</sup> Newton in the 2<sup>d</sup> Book of his Principles makes frequent mention <a id="l657"></a>of the increase of the velocities wherewith lines are described. The <a id="l658"></a>lines are the fluents, the velocities their fluxions &amp; the increase of the <a id="l659"></a>velocities the fluxions of their fluxions or second fluxions. And parti<a id="l660"></a>cularly in demonstrating the 14<sup>th</sup> Proposition of the second Book of his <a id="l661"></a>Principles, he has these words. <em class="underline">Est igitur differentia momentorum, id est <a id="l662"></a>momentum differentiæ arearum</em> &amp;c Where differentia arearum is the <a id="l663"></a>first difference &amp; momentum differentiæ is the second difference of the <a id="l664"></a>areas. So then M<sup>r</sup> Newton, when he wrote his Principles of Philosophy <a id="l665"></a>&amp; a great many years before, had extended his method to the consideration <a id="l666"></a>of the second fluxions of quantities. And indeed, to say that he then understood <a id="l667"></a>not second fluxions is all one as to say that he understood not how to consider <a id="l668"></a>motion as a quantity increasing &amp; decreasing.</p>
<p id="par88">And whereas the great Mathematician represents that M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l669"></a>Newton uses the Letter o in the vulgar manner which destroys the <a id="l670"></a>advantages of the  Differential method: he uses it, &amp; has used it ever since <a id="l671"></a>the writing of his Analysis, in such a manner as makes his method <a id="l672"></a>more beautiful more  Geometrical &amp; more advantageous then <a id="l673"></a>the Differential, &amp; (by joyning the methods of series &amp; fluxions toge<a id="l674"></a>ther) much more universal.</p>
<p id="par89">The Differential method is nothing else then the method of Tan<a id="l675"></a>gents published by M<sup>r</sup> Gregory in the year 1668 &amp; by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in the <a id="l676"></a>year 1670, disguised by changing D<sup>r</sup> Barrows symbols a &amp; e into dy <a id="l677"></a>&amp; dx, improved by the instructions which M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz received by the <a id="l678"></a>Letters of M<sup>r</sup> Newton, &amp; taken from them all by pretending that M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l679"></a>Leibnitz found  it long before he did. For in his Letter dated 21 <a id="l680"></a>Iuly 1677 he  pretended to have found it jam a multo <a id="l681"></a>tempore, &amp; yet he had not found it the year before. For in his <a id="l682"></a>Letter dated 27 Aug. 1676 he wrote that there were many Problems <a id="l683"></a>which could not be reduced to Equations or Quadratures such as were <a id="l684"></a>those of the inverse method of Tangents &amp; many others. This method <a id="l685"></a>without the use of the Letter o is not demonstrative, without the me<a id="l686"></a>thod of series is not universal, nor has any advantages which are not to <a id="l687"></a>be found in the method of Fluxions, nor has M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz added any thing <a id="l688"></a>to it of his own besides a new name &amp; a new notation. And thus much <a id="l689"></a>in answer to the great Mathematician.</p>
<p id="par90">As to what the Author of the Latine paper saith of M<sup>r</sup> Flamsteed &amp; <a id="l690"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Hook: M<sup>r</sup> Newton always acknowledged the use of M<sup>r</sup> Flamsteeds Observati<a id="l691"></a>ons; M<sup>r</sup> Hook could never produce a Demonstration of the Proposition claimed <a id="l692"></a>by him tho often asked to produce one; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz pretended to the same Propo<a id="l693"></a>sition by an erroneous Demonstration; &amp; whether he or M<sup>r</sup> Tschurnhause were <a id="l694"></a>in the right about an erroneous Proposition claimed by them both, I leave to <a id="l695"></a>be examined.</p>
<p id="par91">This Author in the next place complains of the Committee of the R. <a id="l696"></a>Society for representing that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had from M<sup>r</sup> Iames Gregory the <a id="l697"></a>series for finding the Arc of a circle by the Tangent, that is, he confesses that <a id="l698"></a>he has no  other way of defending M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz then by laying aside <a id="l699"></a>the records relating to this matter examined &amp; approved by a numerous Committee <a id="l700"></a>of the R. Society &amp; still ready to be produced</p>
<p id="par92">The same Author in the next place ascribes a certain general method of series <a id="l701"></a>to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz, tho this method was found many years before by M<sup>r</sup> Newton as <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p497v"> &lt;497v&gt; </span> appears by his Letter of 24 Octob. 1676. And in the next place he <a id="l702"></a>magnifies an Invention called the Exponential Calculus, without considering <a id="l703"></a>that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had the hint from M<sup>r</sup> Newton &amp; that this Calculus hath <a id="l704"></a>hitherto been of no use.</p>
<p id="par93"> Our Author tells us also that the English &amp; Scotch, <a id="l705"></a>Wallis, Hook, Newton, Gregory junior, acknowledged 36 years ago that the <a id="l706"></a>series for findiing the Arc  of a circle by the Tangent <a id="l707"></a>was the invention of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; that M<sup>r</sup> Hugens commended it. But he should have complained <a id="l708"></a>of M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz for not letting the English &amp; Scotch &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Hugens know <a id="l709"></a>that this series with many others was sent by  M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l710"></a>in April 1675; And that a Collection of Gregories Papers with this <a id="l711"></a>series in it, was also sent by him to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the next year.</p>
<p id="par94">In the Remarks it is represented that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz never <a id="l712"></a>communicated his reasons to the R. Society of England, &amp; so the <a id="l713"></a>Society has not examined the reasons on both sides for giving <a id="l714"></a>judgment. And upon this pretence, the Author of the Remarks gives <a id="l715"></a>a judgment contrary to that of the Committee of the R. Society. But <a id="l716"></a>the truth is, M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz absolutely refused to give any reasons, call<a id="l717"></a>ing it injustice to expect that he should defend his candor. And the <a id="l718"></a>Committee of the R. Society grownded their Report upon ancient &amp; <a id="l719"></a>unquestionable Records, &amp; published the Records, that the justice of <a id="l720"></a>their Report might  appear to the world. But the Author of the <a id="l721"></a>Remarks has laid aside the Records of the first seven years which <a id="l722"></a>make for M<sup>r</sup> Newton &amp; begins his Report with the years 1676 &amp; <a id="l723"></a>1677, &amp; thereby confesses that he has no way to defend M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l724"></a>but by laying aside the Records which make against him.</p>
<p id="par95">In the Remarks its said further that M<sup>r</sup> Newton did not speak of <a id="l725"></a>this matter till after the death of M<sup>r</sup> Hugens &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Wallis who were <a id="l726"></a>well informed &amp; able to judge thereof: Which  implyes that M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l727"></a>Newton began this dispute. Whereas M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz began it nine years ago by giving an abusive <a id="l728"></a>reflecting account of  M<sup>r</sup> Newton book De Quadratura Figurarum, &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Keil retorted the <a id="l729"></a>charge upon M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz before M<sup>r</sup> Newton knew what M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l730"></a>had done. As for M<sup>r</sup> Hugens he never was well informed about this matter <a id="l731"></a>nor doth it appear that he gave any judgment about it. And as for D<sup>r</sup> Wallis, <a id="l732"></a>he gave his judgment  against M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz 19 years ago in his Preface <a id="l733"></a>to the first Volume of his Mathematical works published A.C. 1695. For there <a id="l734"></a>he saith that M<sup>r</sup>  Newton in his Letters of Iune 13 &amp; Octob. 24 1676 <a id="l735"></a><em class="underline">methodum hanc</em> [de Fluxionibus] <em class="underline">Leibnitio exponit, tum ante decem annos <a id="l736"></a>nedum plures ab ipso excogitatam</em>, explained to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnits the method <a id="l737"></a>of Fluxions invented by him ten years before or above, that is, in the year <a id="l738"></a>1666 or  1665. And in a Letter dated from Oxford Apr. 20 1695 &amp; extant <a id="l739"></a>in the Archives of the R. Society D<sup>r</sup> Wallis represented that he had intima<a id="l740"></a>tion from Holland that M<sup>r</sup> Newton's Papers relating to the Method of <a id="l741"></a>Fluxions should be printed because his notions of fluxions passed there with <a id="l742"></a>great applause under the name of the Differential method. And tho M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l743"></a>Newton has in this matter neglected his reputation abroad, yet in the second book of his Princi<a id="l744"></a>ples written 28 years ago, he mentioned the method of Fluxions as known <a id="l745"></a>to him in the year 1676, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz has hitherto allowed it without <a id="l746"></a> going about to make it appear that the Differential method was known to <a id="l747"></a>him before the year 1677.</p>
<p id="par96">But before M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; his correspondents or some of them have <a id="l748"></a>composed &amp; published  in Germany the Latin Paper without a name where<a id="l749"></a>by they defame M<sup>r</sup> Newton accuse the  committee of the R. Society of parti<a id="l750"></a>ality, affirm &amp; deny things without proof, &amp; endeavour to set aside Records <a id="l751"></a>&amp; bring things to a wrangle: I intend to give you hereafter a fuller account <a id="l752"></a>of these matters out of the Records themselves.</p>
</div>

<div><span class="pagenumber" id="p498r"> &lt;498r&gt; </span>
<p id="par97">I have seen in your journal the  translation <a id="l754"></a>of a Latin  piece dated 29 Iuly 1713 &amp; published in Germany  &amp; the Remarks upon it. These pieces <a id="l755"></a>are full of assertions  without any proof &amp; without the name of the author &amp; so <a id="l756"></a>are of no authority.</p>
<p id="par98">The author of the Latine piece represents that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had not then seen <a id="l757"></a>the Commercium Epistolicum:  &amp; this he could not know without keeping a correspon<a id="l758"></a>dence with  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnits. But a copy of this book was sent to   him by the <a id="l759"></a>Resident of the Elector of Hannover above a year ago &amp;  several other <a id="l760"></a>copies  were sent to Lipsic,  one of which was for him.   The Author tells us further that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz not being at <a id="l762"></a>Leasure to examin this affair himself had referred it to the judgment of a <a id="l763"></a>Mathematician of the first rank very skillfull in these things &amp; very <a id="l764"></a>free from partiality. So then this paper was writ by the correspondents of <a id="l765"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself was the first moover &amp; credit of <a id="l766"></a>the Mathematician  for candor &amp; ability depends upon the credit of M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l767"></a>Leibnitz : &amp; for these reasons this paper must be looked upon as the  best <a id="l768"></a>defence that he &amp; his correspondents were able to make, especially if this <a id="l769"></a>paper be writ in the style of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself as some think. By <a id="l770"></a>his Letters against M<sup>r</sup> Keil it appears that he is  too much concerned  to neglect <a id="l771"></a>this matter:  &amp; his appealing from the Report of a numerous Committe of the R. Society to a  nameless Mathematician of his own chusing is no better then appealing to himself. For he has told the Society that it would be injustice to question his candor, that is, to deny him to be a witness in his own cause.</p>
<p id="par99">Now the great Mathematician conjectures that M<sup>r</sup> Newton spent <a id="l773"></a>his first years in cultivating the method of series without thinking of the <a id="l774"></a>calculus of fluxions or reducing it to general rules. That is, he will not <a id="l775"></a>allow the Analysis communicated by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to  M<sup>r</sup> Collins <a id="l776"></a>in the year 1669 to be a genuine piece. And he brings too arguments <a id="l777"></a>for his conjecture.</p>
<p id="par100">First, saith he, in all the Letters published in the Commercium Episto<a id="l778"></a>licum &amp; in all the Principia Philosophiæ, the  letters with pricks which M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l779"></a>Newton now uses are not to be met with. But in all those Letters (except <a id="l780"></a>the Analysis) &amp; in all the Principia, there was no occasion to make use of <a id="l781"></a>the fluxional calculus. And D<sup>r</sup> Keil hath given a further answer to this <a id="l782"></a>argument long since in his Letter dated 24 May  1711. <em class="underline">Observo ipsum Newtonum</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">sæpius mutasse nomen &amp; notationem calculi. In tractatu <a id="l783"></a>de Analysi Æquationum per series infinitas, incrementum Abscissæ per litteram <a id="l784"></a>o designat, et in Principijs Philosophiæ, Fluentem quantitatem Genitam vocat <a id="l785"></a>ejusque incrementum Momentum appellat: illam literis majoribus A vel B, hoc <a id="l786"></a>minusculis a et b designat</em>.  <a id="l788"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton doth not so. And whether he uses Letters with pricks or other <a id="l789"></a>symbols for fluxions his method is still the same. In his Letter of 24 Octob. <a id="l790"></a>1676 he represents that he had a method of extracting fluents out of <a id="l791"></a>Equations involving their fluxions. Will M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz say that he had no <a id="l792"></a>such method unless  he then used letters with pricks? If so, his <a id="l793"></a>Letters with pricks are as old at least as the year 1676, &amp; by consequence <a id="l794"></a>older then the differential Notes of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz.</p>
<p id="par101">But its to be observed that fluxions &amp; Differences are not quantities <a id="l795"></a>of the same kind. Fluxions are velocities &amp; Differences are small parts of <a id="l796"></a>things generated by fluxion in moments of time: fluxions are always <a id="l797"></a>finite quantities &amp; differences are infinitely little. M<sup>r</sup> Newton uses sometimes <a id="l798"></a>prickt letters sometimes other symbols for fluxions: M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz uses no symbols <a id="l799"></a>for fluxions to this day. The symbols of fluxions used by M<sup>r</sup> Newton, whether with pricks or without, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p498v"> &lt;498v&gt; </span> therefore the oldest in the kind. These he multiplies by the  moment o to <a id="l800"></a>make them infinitely little &amp; puts the  rectangles for moments &amp; <a id="l801"></a>without the  moment o either exprest or understood the prickt letters never signify moments or <a id="l802"></a>differences, but are always finite quantities &amp; signify velocities. The fluxion of time or of <a id="l803"></a>any exponent of time he usually represents by an unit &amp; the moment thereof by the letter o.</p>
<p id="par102">The second reason of the great Mathematician for his conjecture <a id="l804"></a>is that M<sup>r</sup> Newton understood not the differences of differences till after <a id="l805"></a>the writing of his Principia. For there, saith he, the constant increase of <a id="l806"></a>the letter x he represents not by a prickt letter as at present but by the <a id="l807"></a>letter o after the vulgar manner which destroys the advantages of the differ<a id="l808"></a>ential method. Here our great Mathematician commits two mistakes: one by <a id="l809"></a>supposing that M<sup>r</sup> Newton represents differences by  prickt <a id="l810"></a>letters, another by supposing that the method used in the 10<sup>th</sup> Proposi<a id="l811"></a>tion of the second book of the Principia is M<sup>r</sup> Newtons method of <a id="l812"></a>fluxions. Tis only a branch of his method of converging series. In his <a id="l813"></a>Letter dated 10 Decem 1672 where he speaks of a method whereof <a id="l814"></a>the method of Tangents there described is a branch or Corollary, he <a id="l815"></a>represents that this method (which is the method of fluxions) extended to <a id="l816"></a>Questions about the curvature of curves; &amp; thence it is manifest <a id="l817"></a>that he then understood the second fluxions or differences of Differences.</p>
<p id="par103">The Letter o was used  by M<sup>r</sup> Newton in the manner above described in his <a id="l818"></a>Analysis communicated by M<sup>r</sup>  Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> Collins in the <a id="l819"></a>year 1669 &amp; in his book of Quadratures, &amp; is still used by him in <a id="l820"></a>the very same manner.  And thus much in answer to the great Mathematician.</p>
<p id="par104">As to what the Author of the Latin paper saith of M<sup>r</sup> Hook <a id="l825"></a>&amp; M<sup>r</sup> Flamsteed. M<sup>r</sup> Hook indeed claimed one of M<sup>r</sup> Newtons <a id="l826"></a>Propositions but could never produce a demonstration: M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l827"></a>claimed it also but the Demonstration by which he claimed it  is <a id="l828"></a>erroneous.  <a id="l829"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz also claimed an invention from M<sup>r</sup> Tschurnhause But M<sup>r</sup> Newton always acknowledged the use of M<sup>r</sup> Flamsteeds observations.</p>
<p id="par105">Our Author in the next place complains of the Committee of the R. Society <a id="l830"></a>for representing that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had from M<sup>r</sup> Iames Gregory the series for <a id="l831"></a>finding the Arc of a circle by the tangent; that is, he confesses that he has no other way of defending M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz then by presenting that the <a id="l832"></a>Letters of M<sup>rs</sup> Gregory Collins Oldenburg &amp; Leibnitz examined &amp; approved <a id="l833"></a>by a  numerous Committee of the R.

And under this pretence he sent it back to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg <a id="l859"></a>as his own in his Letter dated 27 Aug. 1676. And yet the series which he wrote <a id="l860"></a>of in his said two Letters dated 15 Iuly &amp; 24 Octob 1674  was not this <a id="l862"></a>series  for finding the arc by the tangent, but a Theorem or Method for <a id="l863"></a>finding the arc by the sine. This Theorem or series M<sup>r</sup> Collins had received from <a id="l864"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton in Iuly 1669, &amp; communicated it soon after to his friends <a id="l865"></a>very freely. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was in London in the years 1671, 1672 &amp; the <a id="l866"></a>beginning of 1673, &amp; having met with this series either in London or soon after in France pretended in his said <a id="l867"></a>Letters of 15 Iuly &amp; 24 Octob. 1674 to have found it himself, &amp; yet in <a id="l868"></a>his Letter dated 12 May 1676 desired M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburge to procure from <a id="l869"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Collins the Demonstration thereof, that is, the method of finding it. <a id="l870"></a>And when he had received the method with some of M<sup>r</sup> Newtons series <a id="l871"></a>he pretended to have found  three of those series before, tho he did <a id="l872"></a>not yet understand the method of finding them. For in his Letter <a id="l873"></a>of 27 Aug. 1676 he wrote back for a further explication of the <a id="l874"></a>method. M<sup>r</sup> Newton therefore in his Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 explain<a id="l875"></a>ed it further &amp; added another method of the same kind, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l876"></a>in his Letter dated  21 Iune 1677 still desired a further explication, but <a id="l877"></a>so soon as he understood it, he wrote in his Letter dated 12 Iuly 1677 <a id="l878"></a>that he found by his old papers that he had used one of those methods <a id="l879"></a>before. And by the same power of invention when he had newly found the differential method, (which he might do by the help of <a id="l880"></a> Gregories &amp; Barrows methods of Tangents &amp; Newtons Letters <a id="l881"></a>of 10 Dec. 1672, 13 Iune 1676 &amp; 24 Octob 1676)   he wrote back <em class="underline">Clarissimi Slusij methodum Tangentium nondum <a id="l883"></a>esse absolutam Celeberrimo Newtono assentior. Et jam a multo tempore <a id="l884"></a>rem Tangentium generalius tractavi; scilicet per differentias Ordinata<a id="l885"></a>rum</em>. And yet its very certain that he had but newly found it. For <a id="l886"></a>in his Letter dated 27 Aug 1676 he wrote: <em class="underline">Quod dicere videmini plerasque difficul<a id="l887"></a>tates  (exceptis Problematibus Diophantæis) ad Series Infinitas reduci; <a id="l888"></a>id mihi non videtur. Sunt enim multa usque adeo mira et implexa ut <a id="l889"></a>neque ab æquationibus pendeant neque ex Quadraturis. Qualia sunt ex <a id="l890"></a>multis alijs Problemata methodi tangentium inversæ; quæ etiam Cartesius <a id="l891"></a>in potestate non esse fassus est</em>. These words are a demonstration that he <a id="l892"></a>did not then understand the differential method. He was then composing &amp; polishing the Quadrature of the circle vulgari more &amp; left off that way of writing as soon as he found the differential method. I pass by his claiming <a id="l893"></a>the inventions of Mouton &amp; Paschal, &amp; a considerable part of M<sup>r</sup> Newtons <a id="l894"></a>Principia Philosophiæ.</p>
<p id="par106">Our Author tells us further that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz published in the <a id="l895"></a>Acta Eruditorum a general method for finding the Ordinates of trans<a id="l896"></a>cendent Curves not by extraction of roots but deduced from a profounder <a id="l897"></a>foundation of the differential calculus, by which the business of series was <a id="l898"></a>brought to a greater degree of perfection. But M<sup>r</sup> Newton many <a id="l899"></a>years before (viz<sup>t</sup> in his Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburge dated 24 Octob. 1676) <a id="l900"></a>communicated the very same method in this sentence. <em class="underline">Altera</em> [methodus <a id="l901"></a>consistit] <em class="underline">in assumptione seriei pro quantitate qualibet incognita ex <a id="l902"></a>qua cætera commode derivari possint &amp; in collatione terminorum <a id="l903"></a>homologorum æquationis resultantis ad eruendos terminos assumptæ <a id="l904"></a>seriei</em>.

<p id="par108"> Our author tells us that the English &amp; Scotch, Wallis, Hook, Newton <a id="l912"></a>&amp; Gregory junior, acknowledged 36 years ago the series for finding the <a id="l913"></a>arc of a circle by the Tangent to be the invention of Leibnitz. That <a id="l914"></a>is, he complains of M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg for not letting the English &amp; Scotch know <a id="l915"></a>that he had communicated this series  with several others to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l916"></a>Leibnitz in April 1675. Tis sufficient that the Letters between M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l917"></a>Oldenburg &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz were left by M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg in the Letter-book <a id="l918"></a>of the R. Society &amp; that the Original Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz is still <a id="l919"></a>extant in his own handwriting.   I may add that that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Letter dated 21 Iune 1677 acknowledged that M<sup>r</sup> Newton had a method like the differential. And thus much concerning the printed <a id="l920"></a>paper.</p>
<p id="par109">In the Remarks it's represented that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz never com<a id="l921"></a>municated his Reasons to the Royal Society of England &amp; so the Society <a id="l922"></a>has not examined the reasons on both sides for giving judgment. <a id="l923"></a> But the truth is M<sup>r</sup> Leibnits refused to give any reasons at all, calling it <a id="l924"></a>injustice to expect that he should defend his candour detracting from the candor of M<sup>r</sup> Keil &amp; pressing the R Society to give judgment without hearing  reasons; &amp; the Committee <a id="l925"></a>of the R. Society grounded their Report not upon plausible reasons but upon the matter of fact <a id="l926"></a>conteined in the Letters &amp; Papers found in the Adversaria of <a id="l927"></a>the R. Society &amp; in those of M<sup>r</sup> Collins , &amp; published those Letters &amp; <a id="l928"></a>Papers in the Commercium Epistolicum that all the world might see <a id="l929"></a>the grownd of their Report.  And those records are sufficiently plain to any man that  consider  authentic  considers them impartially. <a id="l931"></a></p>

<p id="par111" class="i0">And they have this further weight that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz is known to be of a temper too <a id="l948"></a>loquacious,  &amp; vainglorious to be admitted a witness in his own cause.</p>

<p id="par112">Sir</p>
<br><br>
<p id="par113">I have seen in your journal the piece sent you from Germany conteining <a id="l949"></a>remarks upon the difference between M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Newton with a translation <a id="l950"></a>of  a Latine piece dated 29 Iuly 1713 &amp; published in Germany <a id="l951"></a> These pieces are full of assertions without proof  without the name <a id="l952"></a>of the author &amp; so are of no authority. </p>
<p id="par114">The author of the Remarks pretends that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz has not yet seen the <a id="l953"></a>Commercium Epistolicum, &amp; therefore  he keeps a correspondence   with M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz But a copy thereof was sent to  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz above a year <a id="l955"></a>ago by the Resident of the Elector of Hanover &amp; several other copies being sent <a id="l956"></a> to Leipsick, notice was sent back that one of them was sent to him from thence.</p>
<p id="par115">This nameless Author pretends that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnits never communicated his reasons to <a id="l957"></a> the R. Society of England &amp; so the Society has not examined the reasons <a id="l958"></a>on both  sides for giving judgment.  When the <a id="l959"></a>secretary of the R. Society sent to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz a Letter of D<sup>r</sup> Keil  <a id="l960"></a>conteining such reasons against him as were unanswerable, M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz refused to <a id="l961"></a> answer them or produce any reasons for himself  &amp; <a id="l962"></a>cried out that M<sup>r</sup> Keil impugned his candour, which that  at such an <a id="l963"></a>age &amp; after so many documents of his life he should defend, would be injustice to expect <a id="l964"></a>That is, he told the Society that they  would be unjust unless they admitted <a id="l965"></a>him to be a witness for himself, contrary to the laws of all nations. Whereupon <a id="l966"></a>the Society whose motto is <em class="underline">Nullius in verba</em> appointed a Committee to examin <a id="l967"></a>Records &amp; the Report of the Committee being grounded upon   questionable Records is as valid as the Records themselves, For the Records are plain <a id="l968"></a>&amp; evident,  &amp; the pretended reasons of M<sup>r</sup> Leib<a id="l969"></a>nitz are not to be regarded till he produces them.</p>
<p id="par116">The said Author proceeds to make a  Report contrary to that of the R. Society, as if the Report <a id="l970"></a>of a nameless person could be of any validity. He begins his report  <a id="l971"></a>with the Letters between M<sup>rs</sup> Leibnitz Oldenburgh  Newton  <a id="l972"></a>&amp; drops the Analysis communicated by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> Collins  some years before in which <a id="l973"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newtons method of fluxions is plainly described &amp; therefore his report is <a id="l974"></a>partial. Let the Records themselves published in the Commercium Epistolicum <a id="l975"></a>be consulted.</p>

<p id="par118">The author complains  of M<sup>r</sup> Newton's long silence <a id="l978"></a>but before he complained of this he ought to have shewed that  M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l979"></a>Newton  began this dispute It's almost 40 years  since he left of <a id="l980"></a> corresponding in Mathematicks &amp; almost twenty since he left of <a id="l981"></a>these studies. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz by what he printed against M<sup>r</sup> Newton in the <a id="l982"></a>Acta Eruditorum in Ianuary Anno 1707,  begun this dispute, M<sup>r</sup> Keil answered M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l983"></a>&amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  wrote his first Letter against M<sup>r</sup> Keil before M<sup>r</sup> Newton knew what was <a id="l984"></a>printed against him  in the Acta Eruditorum as is <a id="l985"></a>here well known. And M<sup>r</sup> Newton must be allowed to give his friends leave to <a id="l986"></a>repell injuries.</p>
<p id="par119">The Author of the Latine piece dated 29 Iuly 1713 represents that <a id="l987"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had not then seen the Commercium Epistolicum &amp; therefore he <a id="l988"></a>also keeps a correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz. He tells us further that M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l989"></a>Leibnitz not being at leasure to examin this affair himself,  had referred <a id="l990"></a>it to the judgment of a Mathematician of the first rank very skilful in <a id="l991"></a>these things &amp; very free from partiality. So then this paper was writ by <a id="l992"></a>the correspondents of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnits, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself was the first mover: &amp; <a id="l993"></a>therefore it must be looked upon as the ablest defence that he &amp; his cor<a id="l994"></a>respondents  could make, especially if this paper be writ in the style <a id="l995"></a>of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself as some think. By his Letters against M<sup>r</sup> Keill it appears that he is much</p>
<p id="par120">Now this great Mathematician  conjectures that M<sup>r</sup> Newton <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p500v"> &lt;500v&gt; </span> spent his first years in cultivating the method of series without thinking of <a id="l996"></a>the calculus of fluxions or reducing it to general Rules. That is, he will not <a id="l997"></a>allow the Analysis communicated by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> Collins in the year 1669 <a id="l998"></a>to be a genuine piece.</p>
<p id="par121">And he brings two arguments for his conjecture. First saith he in all <a id="l999"></a>the Letters published in the Commercium Epistolicum &amp; in all his Principia <a id="l1000"></a>Philosophiæ the letters with pricks which M<sup>r</sup> Newton now uses are not to be <a id="l1001"></a>met with. But D<sup>r</sup> Keill hath answered this argument long since in his <a id="l1002"></a>Letter dated 24 May  1711.  <em class="underline">Observo ipsum Newtonum</em> <a id="l1003"></a>saith he <em class="underline">sæpius mutasse nomen &amp; notationem calculi. In tractatu de Analysi <a id="l1004"></a>Æquationum per series infinitas, incrementum Abscissæ per literam o designat. <a id="l1005"></a>Et in Principijs Philosophiæ, Fluentem, quantitatem Genitam vocat, ejusque <a id="l1006"></a>incrementum momentum appellat: illam literis majoribus A vel B, hoc mi<a id="l1007"></a>nusculis a et b designat</em>. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz confines his Method to the symbols <a id="l1008"></a>dx &amp; dy, so that if you take away his symbols you take away his method. <a id="l1009"></a> M<sup>r</sup> Newton doth not so. And whether he uses Letters with <a id="l1010"></a>pricks or other symbols for fluxion his method is still the same. In his <a id="l1011"></a>Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 he represents that he had a method of  <a id="l1012"></a>extracting fluents out of Equations involving their fluxions. Will M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l1013"></a>Leibnitz say that he had no such method unless he then used letters <a id="l1014"></a>with pricks? If so, his letters with pricks are as old at least as the <a id="l1015"></a>year 1676 &amp; by consequence older then the differential Notes of M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l1016"></a>Leibnitz.</p>
<p id="par122">But its to be observed that fluxions &amp; differences are not quantities <a id="l1017"></a>of the same kind. Fluxions are velocities &amp; differences are small parts <a id="l1018"></a>of things generated by fluxion in moments of time. Fluxions are  always <a id="l1019"></a>finite quantities differences are infinitely little. M<sup>r</sup> Newton sometimes <a id="l1020"></a>uses prickt letters sometimes other letters or symbols for fluxions: M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l1021"></a>Leibnitz uses no symbols for fluxions to this day. The symbols of fluxions <a id="l1022"></a>therefore used by M<sup>r</sup> Newton are the oldest in the kind. These he <a id="l1023"></a>multiplies by the Letter o to make them infinitely little moments or <a id="l1024"></a>differences, &amp; without the letter o either exprest or understood they <a id="l1025"></a>never signify differences but are always finite quantities &amp; signify velocities.</p>
<p id="par123">The second reason of our Mathematician for his conjecture is that M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l1026"></a>understood not the differences of differences till after the writing of his <a id="l1027"></a>Principia. For there, saith he, the constant increase of the letter x <a id="l1028"></a>he represents not by a prickt letter  as at present but by the <a id="l1029"></a>letter o after the vulgar manner which destroys the advantages of <a id="l1030"></a>the differential method. Here our great Mathematician commits two <a id="l1031"></a>mistakes: one by supposing that M<sup>r</sup> Newton represents differences by <a id="l1032"></a> prickt letters; another by supposing that the method used in the Princi<a id="l1033"></a>pia is M<sup>r</sup> Newtons method of fluxions. Tis only a branch of his method of converging series, a method of resolving <a id="l1034"></a>quantities into converging series &amp; applying those series to the solution of <a id="l1035"></a>Problemes without considering fluxions. In his Letter dated 10 Decem 1672 where he is speaking of <a id="l1036"></a> a method whereof the method of Tangents there  described is a branch or <a id="l1037"></a>corollary, he represents that this method (which is the method of fluxions) extended to Questions about <a id="l1038"></a>the  Curvature of curves, &amp; thence its manifest that he <a id="l1039"></a>then understood the second fluxions or differences of differences. In the end of his book of Quadratures</p>
<p id="par124">And as for  the letter o in the method of fluxions M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l1040"></a>Newton used it in his Analysis communicated to M<sup>r</sup> Collins by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in <a id="l1041"></a>the year 1669, &amp; in his book of Quadratures where he represents fluxions by <a id="l1042"></a> prickt letters, &amp;  he still used it in the same sence. And as it is the oldest <a id="l1043"></a>notation so it is the best, the method thereby being more convenient more <a id="l1044"></a>elegant &amp; more Geometrical  then the Differential &amp; as universal. D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in his method of Tangents published <a id="l1045"></a>A.C. 1670, put the letters a &amp; e for the differences of the Abscissas &amp; <a id="l1046"></a>Ordinates, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnits seven years after changed these letters a &amp; e into <a id="l1047"></a>the symbols dx &amp; dy &amp; gave the method a new name; beginning where <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p501r"> &lt;501r&gt; </span>  D<sup>r</sup> Barrow left off as that candid Gentleman the Marquess <a id="l1048"></a>de L'Hospital  observed long since in the Preface to his <a id="l1049"></a> Analysis. And this was the original of the differential method, M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l1050"></a>Leibnitz learning by the Letters of M<sup>r</sup> Newton how to improve <a id="l1051"></a>the differential method of D<sup>r</sup> Barrow.  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  in his Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburgh <a id="l1053"></a>dated 27 Aug. 1676  wrote: <em class="underline">Quod dicere videmini <a id="l1054"></a>plerasque difficultates  (exceptis Problematibus Diophantæis ad series <a id="l1055"></a>infinitas reduci id mihi non videtur. Sunt enim multa usque adeo <a id="l1056"></a>mira et implexa ut neque ab æquationibus pendeant neque ex Quadra<a id="l1057"></a>turis. Qualia sunt (ex multis alijs) problemata methodi tangentium <a id="l1058"></a>inversæ</em>. And these words make it demonstratively certain that <a id="l1059"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz did not then understand the differential method. And <a id="l1060"></a>yet in his Letter dated 21 Iune 1677 he wrote <em class="underline">Clarissime Slusij <a id="l1061"></a> methodum tangentium nondum esse absolutam <a id="l1062"></a>Celeberrimo Newtono assentior. Et jam a multo tempore rem <a id="l1063"></a>tangentium generalius tractavi, scilicet per differentias Ordinata<a id="l1064"></a>rum</em>. He had newly  found the differential method: &amp; to make <a id="l1065"></a>it his own pretended that he had found it jam a multo tempore <a id="l1066"></a>But if he would have us beleive that he found it before the <a id="l1067"></a>year 1677  it lies upon him to prove it. For  its against the law of all nations to allow any <a id="l1069"></a>many to be a witness in his own cause. And thus much in Answer to <a id="l1070"></a>the great Mathematician</p>
<p id="par125">As to what  the Author of the Latin paper saith of M<sup>r</sup> Hook  He indeed claimed <a id="l1071"></a>one of M<sup>r</sup> Newtons Propositions but could never produce a demonstra<a id="l1072"></a>tion. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz has claimed it also but  the Demonstration by which he endeavoured to make it his own is erroneous. And  if M<sup>r</sup> Flamsteed  denyed M<sup>r</sup> Newton the use of his  Observations, M<sup>r</sup> Tschurnhause denyed M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz an invention </p>
<p id="par126">Our Author in the next place  complains of the Committee of the <a id="l1077"></a>Royal Society for  representing that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had from M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l1078"></a>Iames Gregory the Series for finding the arc of a Circle by the tangent <a id="l1079"></a>  that is, he represents that the letters of Grego<a id="l1081"></a>ry Collins  Oldenburg &amp; Leibnitz  examined &amp; approved by the Committee &amp; <a id="l1082"></a>published in the Commercium were  fourged.

But upon the death of M<sup>r</sup> Gregory M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz to make this <a id="l1097"></a>series his own pretended in his Letter dated 28 Decem 1675 that he had  communicated it at Paris <a id="l1098"></a>above two years before &amp; that it was the series which he had wrote of to <a id="l1099"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg before, that is in his Letters of 15 Iuly &amp; 24 Octob 1674 &amp; <a id="l1100"></a>under this pretence he sent it back to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg as his own in his Letter <a id="l1101"></a>dated 27 Aug. 1676. Whereas the series which he wrote of  in his said <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p501v"> &lt;501v&gt; </span> two Letters dated 15 Iuly &amp; 24 Octob 1674 was not this series but another <a id="l1102"></a>for finding the Arc of a circle by the sine. This series M<sup>r</sup> Collins had re<a id="l1103"></a>ceived from M<sup>r</sup> Newton  in Iuly 1669 &amp; communicated it soon after to some of <a id="l1104"></a>his friends. M<sup>r</sup>  Leibnitz was in London  in the years  1671 <a id="l1105"></a>1672 &amp; 1673, &amp; having met with this series pretended in his said Letters of <a id="l1106"></a>15 Iuly &amp; 24 Octob 1674 to have found it himself &amp; yet in his Letter dated <a id="l1107"></a> 12 May 1676 desired M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg to procure  from M<sup>r</sup> Collins the Demonstration <a id="l1108"></a>thereof, that is, the method of finding it. And when he had received the <a id="l1109"></a>method with some  of M<sup>r</sup> Newtons series, he  pretended to have found <a id="l1110"></a> some of   those series  before, though he did not yet under<a id="l1111"></a>stand the method of finding them. For in his Letter of 27 Aug 1676 he <a id="l1112"></a>wrote back for a further explication of the method. And when M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l1113"></a>in his Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 had explained a double method  &amp; added another method of regression M<sup>r</sup> Leibnits wrote back <a id="l1114"></a>in his Letter dated 12 Iuly 1677 for a further explication. <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>or<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> so soon as he understood it he wrote back that he  found by his old papers that he had  used one of those methods before. <a id="l1115"></a>And by the same spirit,  of invention when  by the help of  <a id="l1116"></a>Newtons Letters &amp;  Gregories &amp; Barrows methods of Tangents he had newly found <a id="l1117"></a>the differential method, to make that method his own, he wrote back  <a id="l1118"></a><em class="underline">Et jam a multo tempore rem tangentium generalius tractavi scilicet per <a id="l1119"></a>differentias Ordinatarum</em>. And yet its very certain that he had but newly found it. For in his Letter dated</p>
<p id="par127">But our Author tells us that the English &amp; Scotch (viz<sup>t</sup> Wallis, Hook, Newton <a id="l1120"></a>&amp; Gregory junior,)  acknowledged for above 36 years together the <a id="l1121"></a> Series for finding the arc of a circle by the Tangent to be  <a id="l1122"></a>the invention of Leibnits.  Hoos is dead long since &amp; medled not <a id="l1123"></a>with these matters. Wallis &amp; Gregory lived at Oxford &amp; Newton at Cambridge and first at Edinburgh &amp; then at Oxford &amp; <a id="l1124"></a> had not opportunity of knowing what passed between Oldenburg &amp; Leibnitz. Gregory  in a treatise published 1684, complained that nothing <a id="l1126"></a>of his Vnkles adversaria relating to this method of series came to his <a id="l1127"></a>hands except a few examples destitute of the method of finding them. <a id="l1128"></a>Oldenburg died soon after he had sent Gregories series to Leibnitz &amp; <a id="l1129"></a>when Leibnitz sent him word that he had found this series  some years <a id="l1130"></a>before, there was no reason for Oldenburg to fall out with his friend &amp; countriman about <a id="l1131"></a>it. It was no bodies interest  but Gregories to trouble <a id="l1132"></a>themselves about it, &amp; the matter might have lain  <a id="l1133"></a>still in the dark had not M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself put the R. Society <a id="l1134"></a> upon appointing a Committe to search their Archives &amp; those of M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l1135"></a>Collins  about what related to the correspondence  between Oldenburg Collins &amp; Leibnitz. And since <a id="l1137"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; his correspondents question the credit of the Letters <a id="l1138"></a>found  upon this search the R. Society have ordered affadavits to be taken thereof <a id="l1139"></a>before a publick Notary &amp; are ready to shew the Originals &amp; affadavits to any publick ministers <a id="l1140"></a>of the  Empire France or Holland at the request <a id="l1141"></a>of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz or his friends.</p>
<p id="par128">Our Author tells us that  Leibnitz shewed the series for the arc <a id="l1142"></a>by the Tangent to  Hugenius who applauded the same &amp; that M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l1143"></a>also acknowledged the method by which he found it to be a new one but he <a id="l1144"></a>does not tell us that  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz let either M<sup>r</sup> Hygens or M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l1145"></a>Newton know that he had received this series from M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg. And his method is only a Proposition for transmuting of Figures &amp; deserves not to be called a method of series.</p>
<p id="par129">Our Author adds that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz published in the Acta Leipsica <a id="l1146"></a>a  general method for finding the Ordinates of transcendent <a id="l1147"></a>curves not by extraction of roots but  deduced from a profounder <a id="l1148"></a>foundation of the differential Calculus, by which the business of series was <a id="l1149"></a>brought to a greater degree of perfection. But M<sup>r</sup> Newton many years before, <a id="l1150"></a>(viz in his Letter dated 24 Octob. 1676)  communicated the same method in this <a id="l1151"></a>sentence. <em class="underline">Altera</em> [methodus consistit] <em class="underline">in assumptione seriei pro quantitate qua<a id="l1152"></a>libet incognita ex qua cætera commode derivari possint, &amp; in collatione <a id="l1153"></a>terminorum homologorum æquationis resultantis ad eruendos terminos assum<a id="l1154"></a>ptæ seriei</em>. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz therefore has no title to any part of the <a id="l1155"></a>method of converging series.</p>
<p id="par130">Our author tells us further that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was the first who used <a id="l1156"></a>the exponential calculus. Certainly M<sup>r</sup> Newton was the first who  used fracti<a id="l1157"></a>ons radicals &amp;  negative quantities for the indices of Dignities &amp;  thereby <a id="l1158"></a> very much enlarged  Analysis &amp; laid the foundation of making it universal. In his Letter dated 24 Octob. 1676 he <a id="l1159"></a>mentioned such indices of Dignities &amp; thereupon M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his  Answer dated 21 <a id="l1160"></a>Iune 1677 proposed  æquations with indeterminate dignities, But  such æquations have hitherto been of no use.</p>

<p id="par138">M<sup>r</sup> Newton in a Letter written to M<sup>r</sup> Collins 10 Decemb. 1672, that is, some weeks <a id="l1264"></a>before Slusius sent his Method of Tangents into England, described the same method of tan<a id="l1265"></a>gents as a Corollary or branch of his general method – – – – extended it to the con<a id="l1266"></a>sideration of the second fluxions.</p>
<p id="par139">And in his Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg dated 24 Octob. 1676 he represented that <a id="l1267"></a>five years before, viz A.C. 1671, he wrote a treatise of the method of infinite series <a id="l1268"></a>&amp; of another method which readily gave the method of Tangents of Slusius &amp; stuck <a id="l1269"></a>not at surds &amp; which was founded in this sentence. Data æquatione quotcunque flu<a id="l1270"></a>entes quantitates involvente, invenire fluxiones &amp; vice versa. Which sentence <a id="l1271"></a>relating to the 2<sup>d</sup> 3<sup>d</sup> &amp; following fluxions as well as to the first: it must be <a id="l1272"></a>allowed that in the year 1671 he had extended his method to all those fluxions, <a id="l1273"></a>especially since the method is one &amp; the same in them all. The method which <a id="l1274"></a>being applied to the first equation gives a new equation involving the first <a id="l1275"></a>fluxions, if applied to this   new equation will give  another new one involving the <a id="l1276"></a>second fluxions, &amp; so on perpetually.</p>
<p id="par140">The sentence Data æquatione quotcunque fluentes quantitates involvente <a id="l1277"></a>invenire fluxiones &amp; vice versa, being the foundation of the method upon <a id="l1278"></a>which he wrote in the year 1671 &amp;  relating to the 2<sup>d</sup> 3<sup>d</sup> &amp; following <a id="l1279"></a>fluxions as well as to the first,  &amp; being one &amp; the <a id="l1280"></a>same method in them all, it must be allowed that his method in the year 1671  <a id="l1281"></a>extended  to all the fluxions.

However the <a id="l1318"></a>R.

And while M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz instead of a sober  defence has  set on foot the <a id="l1332"></a>writing of this  paper  &amp; either writ it himself &amp; sent  it <a id="l1333"></a>to his correspondent to be published or knows the names of them who <a id="l1334"></a>writ it, he has made himself answerable for the whole untill he shall <a id="l1335"></a>discover the names of his Accomplices.</p>
