<span class="pagenumber" id="p001r"> &lt;1r&gt; </span><h2 id="hd1" class="cent">An Interpretation of Daniel's Beasts</h2><br><br>
<p id="par1">In the language of Prophesy Beasts are put for nations &amp; kingdoms <a id="l1"></a>&amp; their several parts for the analogous parts of the Kingdoms <a id="l2"></a>as their  heads for the governing parts their horns for <a id="l3"></a>the military powers, their wings for the regions into which they extend &amp; the powers whereby they raise &amp; move themselves,  their bodies for the common people <a id="l5"></a>their flesh for the riches their bones  for strong holds, their <a id="l6"></a>teeth, nails &amp; hoofs for bands of soldiers such as are Legions <a id="l7"></a>Squadrons, Regiments &amp; Companies, &amp; the number of heads <a id="l8"></a>horns or wings of any Beast for the number of Governments Dominions or particu<a id="l9"></a>lar Kingdoms in that Beast. And because short-lived Beasts <a id="l10"></a>are put for long-lived Kingdoms the days of the Beasts are <a id="l11"></a>put for the years of the Kingdoms. These things I take for <a id="l12"></a>granted having explained them in another place &amp; upon this <a id="l13"></a>foundation I proceed to explain the Prophesies of Daniel</p>
<p id="par2">Daniel tells us that the Golden head the silver breast <a id="l14"></a>the brazen belly &amp; the iron leggs of the statue in Nebuchad<a id="l15"></a>nezzars vision signify four successive kingdoms  wherof the <a id="l16"></a>first is that of the Babylonians or Assyrians at Babylon. <em class="underline">Thou <a id="l17"></a>o King</em>, saith he to Nebuchadnezzar, <em class="underline">art King of Kings for the <a id="l18"></a>God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom power &amp; strength <a id="l19"></a>&amp; glory, &amp; wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts <a id="l20"></a>of the field &amp; the fowls of the heaven</em> [that is the Kingdoms <a id="l21"></a>of the world] <em class="underline">hath he given into thine hand &amp; hath made <a id="l22"></a>thee ruler over them all: Thou art this head of Gold. And <a id="l23"></a>after thee</em> [that is after thy Kingdom <em class="underline">shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee</em> [the <a id="l24"></a>Medo-Persian] <em class="underline">&amp; another third kingdom of brass</em> [the Grecian] <a id="l25"></a><em class="underline">which shall bear rule over all the earth &amp; the fourth King<a id="l26"></a>dom</em> [the Roman] <em class="underline">shall be strong as iron, for as much as iron</em> <a id="l27"></a>breaketh in pieces &amp; subdueth all things.</p>
<p id="par3">Daniel tells us also that the four Beasts in his own vision <a id="l28"></a>the Lion, the Bear, the Leopard &amp; the dreadfull terrible &amp; <a id="l29"></a>exceedingly strong ten horned Beast which arose successively out <a id="l30"></a>of the great sea, are <em class="underline">four kingdoms which shall arise out of the <a id="l31"></a>earth</em>. And all Interpreters agree that these kingdoms are the <a id="l32"></a>same which those signified by the four parts of the Statue, <a id="l33"></a>the ten horns of the fourth Beast answering to the  ten toes <a id="l34"></a>of the iron leggs; &amp; the everlasting kingdom of the Son of <a id="l35"></a>man which succeeds the four &amp; is over all nations &amp; shall not <a id="l36"></a>pass away (Dan 7.14,) answering to the stone which smote the <a id="l37"></a>Image upon his feet &amp; brake it to pieces &amp; became a great <a id="l38"></a>mountain &amp; filled the whole earth &amp; signifies a kingdom which <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> God shall set up &amp; which shall break in pieces &amp; consume the former <a id="l39"></a>kingdoms &amp; not be left to other people but stand for <a id="l40"></a>ever. Dan. 2.34, 35, 44.</p>
<p id="par4">So then the Lion which is the first of the four Beasts <a id="l41"></a>signifies the Kingdom of Babylon. This Lion had eagles wings <a id="l42"></a>to signify the double nation &amp; dominion of Assyria &amp; <a id="l43"></a> Chaldea. With these wings it was lifted up from <a id="l44"></a>the earth &amp; made to stand upon the feet as a man, that <a id="l45"></a>is it was raised high in dominion &amp; power. And a mans heart <a id="l46"></a>was given to it to signify its humanity towards other <a id="l47"></a>kingdoms. For the Kings of Nineveh &amp; Babylon upon <a id="l48"></a>conquering any new kingdom did not presently destroy <a id="l49"></a>the government thereof as the following Monarchies <a id="l50"></a>did but only made it tributary till it rebelled.  Ieru<a id="l51"></a>salem rebelled twice before the king of Babylon <a id="l52"></a>would destroy it. Daniel beheld till the Lyons wings <a id="l53"></a>were pluckt wherewith he raised himself up from <a id="l54"></a>the earth, that is till his power &amp; dominion was taken <a id="l55"></a>away wherewith he had exalted himself. The Lyon <a id="l56"></a>was not slain but continues still alive with his wings <a id="l57"></a>pluckt. For the three first Beasts had their lives <a id="l58"></a>prolongued for a season &amp; time after their dominions <a id="l59"></a>were taken away Dan. 7.12 that is untill they are slain by the two edged sword Apoc. 19.15, 21.. And so all the four parts <a id="l60"></a>of the statue continue in being together till the stone <a id="l61"></a>cut out of the mountain  smites the iron feet of the <a id="l62"></a>statue &amp; breaks them all to pieces, the iron the brass <a id="l63"></a>the silver &amp; the gold &amp; the wind carries them away toge<a id="l64"></a>ther. So then the four parts of the Image &amp; all Da<a id="l65"></a>niels Beasts are in being to this day, the bodies of the <a id="l66"></a>Beasts signifying not the persons of Kings but the regions powers <a id="l67"></a>&amp; dominions of those nations. The Ram had two horns <a id="l68"></a>when the Medes &amp; Persians signified thereby had but <a id="l69"></a>one king &amp; the Lyon has two wings when there was but <a id="l70"></a>one king of the Chaldeans &amp; Assyrians.</p>
<p id="par5">We are therefore to apply the Beasts &amp; parts <a id="l71"></a>of the Statue to four sorts of Nations which reigned <a id="l72"></a>successively &amp; are all of them still in being &amp; perfect<a id="l73"></a>ly distinct from one another. And the first of them <a id="l74"></a>are the nations of Assyria or Babylonia which after the <a id="l75"></a>dissolution of their Empire composed the Province of Ba<a id="l76"></a>bylonia &amp; was the third part of the Persian Empire as <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> Herodotus relates &amp; according to Strabo extended eastward <a id="l77"></a>to Susiana Elymais &amp; Paretica inclusively, northward to <a id="l78"></a>Media &amp; Armenia exclusively &amp; westward to Mesopotamia <a id="l79"></a>&amp; the Arabes Scenitæ inclusively. For Cicilia, Syria, <a id="l80"></a>Phœnicia, Moab, Ammon &amp; Egypt were the auxiliary <a id="l81"></a>nations, as Herodotus calls them, which in the wars with the <a id="l82"></a>Medes revolted from the Assyrians as was explained above <a id="l83"></a>&amp; therefore are not recconed by Strabo among the Nations <a id="l84"></a>of Babylonia. The Lion therefore &amp; the Golden head of <a id="l85"></a>the statue signify to this day the Province of Assyria or <a id="l86"></a>Babylonia bounded as above.</p>
<p id="par6">And so the Bear which is the second Beast &amp; the silver <a id="l87"></a>breast of the statue signify to this day the nations of the <a id="l88"></a>Medes &amp; Persians who reigned in the second place. The <a id="l89"></a>Bear raised it self or stood up on one side to signify that <a id="l90"></a>one of those two nations rose above the other. He held three <a id="l91"></a>ribbs in his mouth to signify his conquests. The ribs are <a id="l92"></a>Sardes Babylon &amp; Memphys the three strong imperial cities <a id="l93"></a>of the Kingdoms of the Lydians  Assyrians &amp; <a id="l94"></a>Egyptians, together which the military  strength  &amp; <a id="l95"></a>power &amp; dominion of those cities.  He holds them  in his mouth between his teeth as if he were <a id="l97"></a>eating them to signify that they are three conquered <a id="l98"></a>nations distinct from his own original body. And he is <a id="l99"></a>bid to arise &amp; eat much flesh to signify that he should <a id="l100"></a>draw great riches from his conquests.</p>
<p id="par7">Daniel signifies this kingdom also by a Ram with <a id="l101"></a>two horns one of which was higher then the other (the <a id="l102"></a>Persian then the Medic) &amp; came up last, &amp; saith that <a id="l103"></a>this Ram with two horns are the Kings (that is kingdoms) <a id="l104"></a>of Media &amp; Persia &amp; that the Ram pusht westward &amp; <a id="l105"></a>northward &amp; southward so that no Beast (that is no King<a id="l106"></a>dom) could stand before him. For the Medes &amp; Persians <a id="l107"></a>carried on their wars &amp; conquests into those quarters <a id="l108"></a>by invading Assyria, Asia minor, Egypt &amp; Greece. The Goat <a id="l109"></a>brake his two horns but slew him not &amp; therefore he <a id="l110"></a>still continues alive which his horns broken &amp; signifies the <a id="l111"></a>nations of the Medes &amp; Persians to this day.</p>
<p id="par8">In like manner the Leopard which is the third Beast <a id="l112"></a>&amp; the brazen belly &amp; thighs of the statue signify to this <a id="l113"></a>day the nations of the Greeks who reigned in the third <a id="l114"></a>place. This Leopard had four wings of a Fowl &amp; four <a id="l115"></a>heads to signify four capital dominions into which this Em<a id="l116"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> pire should extend it self Grecia, Asia minor, Syria &amp; <a id="l117"></a>Egypt: all which nations together compose the Leopard <a id="l118"></a>&amp; are still signified by it.</p>
<p id="par9">The same nations &amp; dominions are also signified <a id="l119"></a>by the He-Goat &amp; his four horns which came up towards <a id="l120"></a>the four winds of heaven. <em class="underline">The rough Goat</em>, saith Daniel, <a id="l121"></a><em class="underline">is the king of Grecia &amp; the great horn between his eyes <a id="l122"></a>is the first king</em> [that is the first kingdom.] <em class="underline">Now that <a id="l123"></a>being broken whereas four</em> [horns] <em class="underline">came up for it, four <a id="l124"></a>kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation but not in <a id="l125"></a>his power</em>. This is further thus explained by Dani<a id="l126"></a>el in another place. <em class="underline">There shall stand up yet three <a id="l127"></a>kings in Persia</em> [Cyrus Cambyses &amp; Darius] <em class="underline">&amp; the fourth</em> <a id="l128"></a>[Xerxes] <em class="underline">shall be far richer then they all: &amp; by his <a id="l129"></a>strength through his riches he shall stir up all against <a id="l130"></a>the realm of Grecia. And a mighty King</em> [Alexander <a id="l131"></a>the great] <em class="underline">shall stand up that shall rule with great do<a id="l132"></a>minion &amp; do according to his will. And when he shall stand <a id="l133"></a>up his kingdom shall be broken &amp; shall be divided towards <a id="l134"></a>the four winds of heaven; &amp; not to his posterity nor <a id="l135"></a>according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom <a id="l136"></a>shall be pluckt up even for others besides those</em> <a id="l137"></a>Daniel goes on to describe the actions of  two of those <a id="l138"></a>horns or kings which he calls kings of the south &amp; north &amp; <a id="l139"></a>names Egypt for the land of the king of the south &amp; by the <a id="l140"></a>king of the north understands the king of Asia minor &amp; <a id="l141"></a>Syria as all interpreters agree. Whence before the union <a id="l142"></a>of Asia &amp; Syria the king of the north must respect Asia <a id="l143"></a>&amp; there will remain Syria &amp; Grecia for the Kings of the <a id="l144"></a>east &amp; west.</p>
<p id="par10">These four regions belonged not to the bodies of the two <a id="l145"></a>first Beasts, they were  all of them in the dominion of the Greeks before <a id="l146"></a>the battel at Arbela whereby the Persian Empire fell: they <a id="l147"></a>continued in their dominion till the Empire of the Romans <a id="l148"></a>arose, they spake the Greek language &amp; after the division <a id="l149"></a>of the Roman Empire into the Greek &amp; Latin Empires they <a id="l150"></a>all belonged to the united monarchical body of the Greek Empire till the Saracens invaded <a id="l151"></a>Syria &amp; Egypt: and therefore they may justly be recconed <a id="l152"></a>the four heads &amp; wings of that Empire &amp; to compose that <a id="l153"></a>body of people which to this day is represented by the four <a id="l154"></a>headed &amp; four winged Leopard &amp; by the Goat with four horns <a id="l155"></a>which Daniel tells us signifies the kingdom of the Greeks divided <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> towards the four winds of heaven</p>
<p id="par11">Alexander the great died at Babylon an. I. P. 4390 &amp; was <a id="l156"></a>succeeded in <em class="underline">Greece &amp; Macedon</em> (the western wing of the Leopard) <a id="l157"></a>by Antipater &amp; others down to Perseus whom the Romans con<a id="l158"></a>quered an P. I. 4546. </p>

<p id="par13"><em class="underline">Seleucus,</em> saith Iustin<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>, <em class="underline">after the death of Alexander</em> <em class="underline">possessing the kingdom of the east built <a id="l162"></a>there a city which he called Antioch after the name of his father <a id="l163"></a>Antiochus</em>, &amp; thence he invaded Babylonia &amp; Bactria. He &amp; his pos<a id="l164"></a>sterity reigned in <em class="underline">Syria</em> till by their civil discords the kingdom <a id="l165"></a>fell into the hands of Tigranes king of Armenia &amp; 18 years <a id="l166"></a>after was reduced into a Roman Province by Lucullus &amp; Pompey <a id="l167"></a>an P. I 4645.</p>
<p id="par14"><em class="underline">Asia minor</em> (the northern wing) fell to the share of Anti<a id="l168"></a>gonus &amp; his son Demetrius who reigned there till Demetrius <a id="l169"></a>was conquered by Seleucus king of Syria an. P. I. 4426. From <a id="l170"></a>which time the kingdoms of Asia &amp; Syria remained united under <a id="l171"></a>one king. But yet they are still represented by two horns, much <a id="l172"></a>after the manner that the kingdoms of the Medes &amp; Persians have <a id="l173"></a>but one king &amp; yet are represented by the two horns of the <a id="l174"></a>Ram till the very fall of the Persian Empire, when the Goat smites <a id="l175"></a>the Ram &amp; breaks his two horns.</p>
<p id="par15">Out of one of the four horns of the Goat in the latter time <a id="l176"></a>of their kingdome  when the transgressors <a id="l177"></a>were come to the full came forth a little horn which  grew <a id="l178"></a>mighty but not by his own power &amp; waxed exceedingly great  <a id="l179"></a>toward the south &amp; toward the east &amp; toward the pleasant land <a id="l180"></a>&amp; it waxed great to the host of heaven &amp; cast down of the host &amp; <a id="l181"></a>stars to the ground &amp; stamped upon them &amp; magnified himself  <a id="l182"></a>against the Prince of the host &amp; by him the daily sacrifice was taken <a id="l183"></a>away &amp; the place of his sanctuary cast down &amp; it cast down the <a id="l184"></a>truth to the grownd &amp; destroyed the mighty &amp; the holy people &amp; prac<a id="l185"></a><br>tised &amp; prospered; &amp; by all these circumstances this horn is the <a id="l186"></a>kingdome of Pergamus. That kingom  came up out of  the kingdom of Macedon by the revolting of Philetærus from Lysimachus, was at first a <a id="l188"></a>little one,  by assistance of the Romans took the greatest part of <a id="l189"></a>Asia minor from Antiochus magnus king of Syria, afterwards <a id="l190"></a>assisted the Romans in conquering Perseus, &amp; being now a large rich &amp; very <a id="l191"></a>flourishing kingdom it descended to the Romans by the last will &amp; testa<a id="l192"></a>ment of Attalus its king,  &amp; by their power &amp; conduct <a id="l193"></a>grew mighty &amp; extended it self  southward into Egypt &amp; Libya &amp; Eastward <a id="l194"></a>into Asia &amp; Syria &amp; the holy-land,  by the arms of Pompey sackt Ierusalem &amp; put an end to the <a id="l195"></a>kingdom of Iudea,  in the reign of Tiberius slew the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> in that of Vespasian took away the daily sacrifice &amp; cast down the <a id="l196"></a>sanctuary, persecuted the Christians &amp; at length separating from the <a id="l197"></a>Romans became the Greek Empire seated at Constantinople, &amp; <a id="l198"></a>in the Churches of Christians set up the worship of  dead men &amp; Images.</p>
<p id="par16">This Empire being monarchical &amp; of long continuance <a id="l199"></a>&amp; conteining precisely the whole body of the Goat, deserved <a id="l200"></a>as much to be represented by the last horn of the Goat <a id="l201"></a>as the kingdom of Alexander did to be represented by the <a id="l202"></a>first great horn between the Goats eyes. The prophesy was <a id="l203"></a>for many days at least 2300 that is for so many years: <a id="l204"></a>it reaches to the time of the end &amp; the Goat is still in being <a id="l205"></a>as are all Daniel's beasts &amp; to this day it signifies the <a id="l206"></a>nations of the Greek Empire. And therefore that Empire <a id="l207"></a>while in a monarchical form under the Greek Emperors was a horn of the Goat <a id="l208"></a>&amp; the most considerable of all the horns. It answers ex<a id="l209"></a>actly to the Goats last horn &amp; is so very considerable that it ought not to want a <a id="l210"></a>representation &amp; there is nothing but that horn to represent <a id="l211"></a>it.</p>
<p id="par17">If you think it improper that the nations of the Greek <a id="l212"></a>Empire in the time of their subjection to the Romans should <a id="l213"></a>be represented by a distinct horn, you are to consider that <a id="l214"></a>horns signify kingdoms as well united under one common <a id="l215"></a>monarch as separate under several monarchs. So the two <a id="l216"></a>horns of the Ram signify the kingdoms of Media &amp; Persia <a id="l217"></a>under one common king &amp; the eastern &amp; northern horn <a id="l218"></a>of the Goat signify the kingdoms of Syria &amp; Asia some<a id="l219"></a>times under one king sometimes under several. The Goat <a id="l220"></a>signifies the four  winged kingdom of the Greeks even when <a id="l221"></a>united to the Romans &amp; when the Goat signifies that kingdom<a id="l222"></a> its not improper to represent it also by a horn of the Goat. <a id="l223"></a>The Romans when they inherited the kingdom of Pergamus <a id="l224"></a>did not break off or destroy a horn of the Goat, but possest it. <a id="l225"></a>By the last will &amp; testament of Attalus, they succeeded <a id="l226"></a>him in the throne of his kingdom &amp; reigned in his stead. By <a id="l227"></a>that Will they became king of Pergamus, &amp; reigned till they <a id="l228"></a>lost that kingdom by the separation of the Greek Empire from <a id="l229"></a>the Latin. So far was the succession of the Latines in <a id="l230"></a>the kingdom of Pergamus, or their reign over the Greeks, <a id="l231"></a>from being an objection, that it was requisite to make good <a id="l232"></a>the prophesy concerning this horn. For Daniel saith that <em class="underline">it <a id="l233"></a>should be mighty but not by its own power</em>. Which is as <a id="l234"></a>much as to say that in the time of its greatness it should <a id="l235"></a>not act apart by its own power but be mighty by another <a id="l236"></a>power superior to its own.</p>
<p id="par18">Now whilst the three first Beasts signify to this day <a id="l237"></a>all the nations of the Assyrian, Medo-Persian &amp; Grecian Empires <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> that is, all the nations from India to Greece &amp; Egypt, there <a id="l238"></a>remains for the body of the fourth Beast, all the nations <a id="l239"></a>of the Roman Empire which lye on this side Greece &amp; Egypt, &amp; <a id="l240"></a>which after the division of this Empire between the Greeks &amp; <a id="l241"></a>Latines, made up the Latin or Western Empire. And there<a id="l242"></a>fore within the compass of these western nations we are to <a id="l243"></a>look for the ten horns of the fourth Beast. These Beasts <a id="l244"></a>or Kingdoms are distinguished  not <a id="l245"></a>only by their successive rise or reign but also by their lan<a id="l246"></a>guage. The first spake the Assyrian &amp; Chaldean, the second <a id="l247"></a>the Persian, the third the Greek, &amp; the fourth the Latin. For <a id="l248"></a>the Greek was spoken in all the Greek Empire &amp; not in the <a id="l249"></a>Latin, &amp; the Latin was spoken in all the Latin Empire &amp; not <a id="l250"></a>in the Greek. By this character therefore the third &amp; fourth <a id="l251"></a>Beasts are distinguisht even when they are united in dominion. <a id="l252"></a>For Daniel<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> makes languages as well as nations a mark of distincti<a id="l254"></a>on</p>
<p id="par19">Now the fourth Beast, saith Daniel, <em class="underline">was dreadfull &amp; terrible <a id="l255"></a>&amp; strong exceedingly &amp; had great iron teeth &amp; nails of brass <a id="l256"></a>&amp; devoured &amp; brake in pieces &amp; stamped the residue which its <a id="l257"></a>feet</em>, &amp; such was the Roman Empire. Twas more dreadful <a id="l258"></a>terrible &amp; strong in battel then any of the former kingdoms <a id="l259"></a>&amp; accordingly had a larger dominion &amp; stood much longer <a id="l260"></a>then any of them. <em class="underline">It devoured</em>, saith Daniel, <em class="underline">the whole earth &amp; trode it down &amp; brake it in pieces</em>, &amp; hereby <a id="l261"></a>its dominions are distinguished into two parts, the nations <a id="l262"></a>which composed the body of the Beast before it began to <a id="l263"></a>be considered in this prophesy or which were afterwards devoured by <a id="l264"></a>it &amp; converted into its body &amp; the nations which it only trode down <a id="l265"></a>&amp; brake in pieces. The first are the nations of the latin <a id="l266"></a>empire the other are the nations of the former empires <a id="l267"></a>&amp; pricipally of the Greeks. Those nations it trode down brake <a id="l268"></a>in pieces &amp; reigned over but they belong principally to the body <a id="l269"></a>of the third Beast. <em class="underline">And it was divers from all the beasts <a id="l270"></a>that were before it</em>. They were governed by kings, this by <a id="l271"></a>a Senate &amp; Consuls. <em class="underline">And it had ten horns</em>, that is it became <a id="l272"></a>divided into ten kingdoms. It was not so divided at its first <a id="l273"></a>rise for then it could not have been so dreadfull &amp; exceed<a id="l274"></a>ing strong, but in the latter part of its reign it became <a id="l275"></a>divided. The first part of its reign is signified by the iron <a id="l276"></a>leggs of Nebuchadnezzars statue &amp; in their reign the king<a id="l277"></a>dom is said to be strong as iron &amp; to break in pieces &amp; bruise <a id="l278"></a>as iron that breaketh in pieces &amp; subdueth all things. Dan. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> 2. 33, 40. The latter part of its reign is signified by <a id="l279"></a>the feet of the Statue which consisted of iron &amp; clay <a id="l280"></a>mixed together &amp; had ten toes. In respect of the toes <a id="l281"></a>Daniel saith that the kingdom shall be divided &amp; in respect <a id="l282"></a>of the iron &amp; clay which adhere not together that it <a id="l283"></a>shall be partly strong as iron &amp; partly brittle &amp; they <a id="l284"></a>shall not cleave together. Dan. 2.41, 42, 43. We are <a id="l285"></a>therefore to seek for the ten horns in the latter <a id="l286"></a>times of the fourth kingdom when it begins to grow <a id="l287"></a>weak &amp; divided. The ten horns out of this kingdom, saith <a id="l288"></a>Daniel are ten kings that shall arise &amp; another shall <a id="l289"></a>arise after them.</p>
<p id="par20">Now the Roman Empire continued in its full strength <a id="l290"></a>till the death of Theodosius the great which was 561 <a id="l291"></a>years after the conquest of Greece by the Romans, and <a id="l292"></a>if at any time it was shaken as  in the time of the <a id="l293"></a>30 Tyrants or divided as at the death of Constantine the <a id="l294"></a>great it soon recovered &amp; reunited. Theosodius left it <a id="l295"></a>divided into the Greek &amp; Latin Empires seated at Rome <a id="l296"></a>&amp; Constantinople. The  Greek Empire continued intire <a id="l297"></a>about 240 years &amp; then lost Syria &amp; Egypt to the <a id="l298"></a>Saracens but yet stood above 800 years longer before the <a id="l299"></a>Turks overthrew it. The Latin empire stood entire about <a id="l300"></a>12 or 13 years &amp; then at once A.C. 408 &amp; 409 brake into <a id="l301"></a>ten kingdoms, the rise of which was as follows.</p>
<p id="par21">The Visigoths in the reign of  Valens the Emperor in<a id="l302"></a>vaded the eastern part of the empire, were beaten by  Theodosius &amp;  upon submission had seats granted them in  Thrace as subjects of <a id="l304"></a> the Empire  A.C. 380. After the death of Theodosius they rebelled <a id="l305"></a>made Alaric their captain &amp; troubled  the Eastern Empire <a id="l306"></a>for about five years together, &amp; then advancing towards the <a id="l307"></a>western empire they were so beaten by Stilico the commander <a id="l308"></a>of the forces of that empire that Claudian calls the remainder <a id="l309"></a>of their forces <em class="underline">tanta ex gente reliquias breves</em> &amp; Prudentius <a id="l310"></a><em class="underline">gentem deletam</em>. Thereupon Alanic submitted being so far <a id="l311"></a>humbled that Orosius tells us he did <em class="underline">pro pace optima et quibus<a id="l312"></a>cunque sedibus suppliciter &amp; simpliciter orare</em>. Then Stilico <a id="l313"></a>designing by their means to gain the Empire favoured them <a id="l314"></a>underhand &amp; after some time procured a military Prefecture <a id="l315"></a>for Alaric &amp; sent him into the east in the service of Hono<a id="l316"></a>rius the western Emperor, committing some Roman troops to his <a id="l317"></a>conduct amongst his Goths &amp; promissing to follow soon after <a id="l318"></a>with his own army. His pretence was to recover some regions </p>
