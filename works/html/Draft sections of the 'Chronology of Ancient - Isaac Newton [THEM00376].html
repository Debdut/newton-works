These men came with colonies <a id="l63"></a>from Egypt, &amp; began to build towns &amp; civilize the Greeks soon after their <a id="l64"></a>coming. And these towns are recconed the oldest in Europe. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> For before the seas began to be navigated, Europe could be peopled only by Scythians from the north side of the <a id="l65"></a>Euxine sea, &amp; there the Scythians  long after those days lived <a id="l66"></a> without towns or houses, &amp; the Pelasgians were wanderers like <a id="l67"></a>the Scythians &amp; spake a language which was  barbarous to the Greeks. Among the Scythians <a id="l68"></a>may be recconed <a id="l69"></a>Ogygus the founder <a id="l70"></a>of the city Eleusis <a id="l71"></a>in the days of Ina<a id="l72"></a>chus or Phorone<a id="l73"></a>us.

<p id="par4">Strabo mentioning the first men who leaving the sea <a id="l80"></a>coasts ventured out into the deep &amp; undertook long voiages <a id="l81"></a>names Bacchus, Hercules, Iason, Vlysses, &amp; Menelaus &amp; that <a id="l82"></a>the dominion of Minos over the seas was celebrated &amp; the <a id="l83"></a>navigation of the Phœnicians who went beyond the Pillars of <a id="l84"></a>Hercules &amp; built cities there &amp; in the middle of the sea coasts <a id="l85"></a>of Afric presently after the war of Troy. These Phenicians <a id="l86"></a>were Tyrians &amp; at that time built Carthage in Afric, Tartessus in Spain, &amp; Gabes in the Island of <a id="l87"></a>that name without the  mouth of the straits.

In this Temple <a id="l91"></a>was the golden belt of Teucer, &amp; the golden Olive of <a id="l92"></a>Pigmalion bearing Smaragdine fruit. And by these con<a id="l93"></a>secrated gifts of Teucer &amp; Pigmaleon you may know <a id="l94"></a>that this Temple was built in their reign.

<p id="par5">Inachus had several sons who reigned in severall <a id="l96"></a>places of Peloponnesus &amp; there built Ægialea afterwards <a id="l97"></a>called Sicyon from Sicyon the grandson of Erechtheus; <a id="l98"></a>Phegeus who built Phegea afterwards called Psophis from <a id="l99"></a>Psophis the daughter of Lycaon. And these were the oldest <a id="l100"></a>towns in Peloponnesus. At that time Sisyphus the son <a id="l101"></a>of Æolus &amp; grandson of Hellen built Ephyra afterwards <a id="l102"></a>called Corinth &amp; Aetholius the son of Æolus built Elis, &amp; Cecrops built Cecropia the Cittadel of Athens, &amp; Lycaon built Lycosura recconed the <a id="l103"></a>oldest town in Arcadia, &amp; his sons who were four &amp; <a id="l104"></a>twenty in number built each of them a town except <a id="l105"></a>the youngest called Oenotrus who sailed thence into <a id="l106"></a>Italy with his people, &amp; there set on foot the building <a id="l107"></a>of towns, &amp; became the Ianus of the Latines. And this <a id="l108"></a>is recconed the first colony which the Greeks sent abroad. <a id="l109"></a>Phoroneus had also several children &amp; grandchildren <a id="l110"></a>who reigned in several places &amp; built new towns, as Car, <a id="l111"></a>Spartus, Apis. And this division &amp; subdivision of territories <a id="l112"></a>has made great confusion in the history of the first kingdoms <a id="l113"></a>of Peloponnesus &amp; thereby given occasion the vainglorious <a id="l114"></a>Greeks to make those kingdoms much older then they really were <a id="l115"></a>Particularly Accusilaus the Argive, out of his brazen Tables, <a id="l116"></a>feigned that Phoroneus was the oldest man in the world; <a id="l117"></a>&amp; to make the kingdom of Argos older then the rest, either <a id="l118"></a>he or some other Greek hath collected several collateral <a id="l119"></a>races of Princes into one continued series of kings pretended <a id="l120"></a>to reign successively at Argos. Others by feigning many <a id="l121"></a>kings of Sicyon have made that kingdom above 200 years <a id="l122"></a>older then that of Argos, though it was founded by Ægi<a id="l123"></a>aleus the brother of Phoroneus. For Apis the third or <a id="l124"></a>fourth king of this Kingdom was the great grandson of <a id="l125"></a>Ægialeus by the fathers side &amp; the Grandson of Phoroneus by <a id="l126"></a>the mothers side, being (as some say) the son of Niobe the daughter of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> Phoroneus.

<p id="par19">Hesiod<sup class="note" id="n64-ref">[64]</sup> describing the four ages of the Gods &amp; Demigods of the <a id="l718"></a>Greeks, represents them to be four generations of men each of <a id="l719"></a>which ended when the men then living grew old &amp; dropt into the <a id="l720"></a>grave, &amp; tells us that the fourth ended with the wars of Thebes <a id="l721"></a>&amp; Troy. And so many generations there are between the destruction <a id="l722"></a>of Troy &amp; the coming of the Phenicians who introduced  <a id="l723"></a>the practise of deifying dead men. Apollonius Rhodius<sup class="note" id="n65-ref">[65]</sup> saith that when <a id="l726"></a>the Argonauts came to Crete they slew Talus a brazen man <a id="l727"></a>who remained of those who were of the brazen age &amp; guarded <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span> that Island.

It was the silver age of the Greeks in which <a id="l730"></a>they began to plow &amp; sow, &amp; Ceres who taught them to do <a id="l731"></a>it flourished in the reign of Celeus Erechtheus &amp; Minos.  Mythologists say that the last woman with whom Iupiter lay <a id="l732"></a>was Alcmena &amp;  thereby put an end to the reign of Iupiter among mortals <a id="l734"></a>when Alcmena was with child of Hercules.  Chiron <a id="l735"></a>who lived till after the Argonautic expedition &amp; had two <a id="l736"></a>grandchildren in that expedition, was  begot in the golden <a id="l737"></a>age when Iupiter was a child in the Cretan cave as above. <a id="l738"></a>  And between the coming of Cadmus &amp;  infancy of Chiron there is room for <a id="l742"></a>the golden age. Its probable therefore that  the Phe<a id="l743"></a>nicians upon their coming into Europe looked upon themselves <a id="l744"></a>as  in a new world, &amp; with relation to this world &amp; <a id="l745"></a>to the Gods whom they introduced in it, feigned the fable of the <a id="l746"></a>four ages of these Gods &amp; measured the length of those ages by the <a id="l747"></a>reigns of the four first kings of Crete, a kingdom  invaded by them &amp; the <a id="l748"></a>greatest kingdom then in Greece; viz<sup>t</sup> by that of Asterius who <a id="l749"></a>from his lying hid in Italy, was called Saturn by the <a id="l750"></a>Latines,  by that of his son Minos who was famous for justice the <a id="l751"></a>character of Iupiter,  by that of his grandson Deucalion who was <a id="l752"></a>an Argonaut, &amp; by that of his great grandson Idomeneus who upon <a id="l753"></a>returning home from the Trojan war sacrificed his <a id="l754"></a>son &amp; for that fact was expelled the kingdom of <a id="l755"></a>Crete.</p>
<p id="par20">Cadmus left his brother Thasus in the island Thasus &amp; <a id="l756"></a>there the Phœnicians built a temple to  Hercules.

And Corybas the son of Iasion <a id="l760"></a>going into Phrygia, carried thither the worship of Cybele or Rhea the <a id="l761"></a>mother of the Gods &amp; gave the name of Corybantes to her Priests. And Lucian lets us know that   <a id="l762"></a> this Rhea was the mother of the Cretan Iupiter <a id="l764"></a>&amp; that Europa was worshipped in the same manner with the <a id="l765"></a>Phenician Astarte &amp;</p>
