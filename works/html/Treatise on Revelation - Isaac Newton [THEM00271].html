<p id="par2" class="i0">that heaven of the Roman throne &amp; in its room the Christian religion was <a id="l1"></a>exalted to the throne: then did the honour, riches, power &amp; temporal <a id="l2"></a>advantages of this religion begin to tempt the heathens dayly to turn <a id="l3"></a>Christians; &amp; in such converts who for temporal interest thus flowed <a id="l4"></a>into the Church the Devil now came down  amongst the <a id="l5"></a>Christian people of the Eastern &amp; Western Empires called the Inhabitants <a id="l6"></a>of the Earth &amp; Sea. For such Converts being the most hypocritical sort <a id="l7"></a>of men, &amp; under profession of Christianity retaining their old heathen <a id="l8"></a>vices &amp; their inclination to all kinds of superstition, they were still <a id="l9"></a>heathens in reality thô in profession Christians, &amp; may deservedly <a id="l10"></a>be called the <em class="underline">Synagogue of Satan who say they are Iews</em> (that is <a id="l11"></a>Christians) <em class="underline">&amp; are not but do lye</em>.</p>
<p id="par3">The visions of the woman &amp; Dragon are a prophetical history <a id="l12"></a>of the fall of the heathen religion &amp; the rise of the apostacy in its room <a id="l13"></a>&amp; that fall was on this manner.  Dioclesian A.C. 302 raised a per<a id="l14"></a>secution of the whole Church which was far greater then all the for<a id="l15"></a>mer persecutions taken together &amp; lasted in the western Empire two <a id="l16"></a>years &amp; in the eastern ten.  In the end of this persecution Constantine <a id="l17"></a>the great was converted to Christianity, &amp; at the same time by the <a id="l18"></a>conquest of Maxentius became Emperour of the West.  Licinius <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>who<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> was <a id="l19"></a>now Emperour of the East &amp; still vexing the Church but not vio<a id="l20"></a>lently for fear of Constantine, endeavoured by treachery to cir<a id="l21"></a>cumvent Constantine &amp; make himself Emperour of the whole: <a id="l22"></a>whereupon a war arose between them, &amp; Constantine overcame, <a id="l23"></a>&amp; then the flourishing of Christianity brought in great numbers <a id="l24"></a>of converts.  Now all this is thus designed in the prophesy.  <em class="underline">The <a id="l25"></a>woman</em> [or Church] <em class="underline">in heaven with Child</em> [of a Christian Empire] <a id="l26"></a><em class="underline">cried</em> [in this persecution of ten years] <em class="underline">travailing in birth and <a id="l27"></a>pained to be delivered</em> .  And [at the same time] <em class="underline">a great red <a id="l28"></a>Dragon</em> [the Greek Empire] <em class="underline">with his tail</em> [or trains of attend<a id="l29"></a>ants &amp; officers civil &amp; military] <em class="underline">drew the third part of the stars <a id="l30"></a>of heaven</em> [the saints of the Greek Empire] <em class="underline">&amp; cast them to the <a id="l31"></a>earth</em> [that earth out of which the two horned beast afterwards arose] <a id="l32"></a>&amp; the woman brought forth a Manchild [the Western Christian Empire <a id="l33"></a>under the dominion of Constantine the great] <em class="underline">&amp; the Dragon was ready</em> <a id="l34"></a>[by the treacheries of Licinius] <em class="underline">to devour her child as soon as it <a id="l35"></a>was born.  And the Manchild</em> [by the victory of Constantine over <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> Licinius] <em class="underline">was caught up unto God &amp; to his throne</em> [for at that time as we <a id="l36"></a>explained above] <em class="underline">there was war in heaven; Michael</em> [or the Manchild] <a id="l37"></a><em class="underline">&amp; his Angels fought against the Dragon, &amp; the Dragon fought &amp; his An<a id="l38"></a>gels, &amp; the great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the Devil <a id="l39"></a>&amp; Satan</em> [the heathen religion] <em class="underline">which deceived the whole world</em>: he was <a id="l40"></a>cast out into the earth [of the Eastern Empire] <em class="underline">And there was heard a <a id="l41"></a>loud voice in heaven, saying, Now is come salvation</em> [from the perse<a id="l42"></a>cuting Dragon] <em class="underline">&amp; strength &amp; the Kingdom of our God</em> [a Christian <a id="l43"></a>Empire] <em class="underline">&amp; the power of his Christ</em> [or dominion of his mystical <a id="l44"></a>body the Christians.] <em class="underline">For the accuser of our brethren is cast out who</em> <a id="l45"></a>[in the persecution] <em class="underline">accused them before our God, &amp; they overcame <a id="l46"></a>him by the blood of the Lamb</em> [slain afresh in his mystical body in <a id="l47"></a>that persecution] <em class="underline">&amp; by the word of their testimony</em> [the testimony of <a id="l48"></a>confessors &amp; Martyrs] <em class="underline">&amp;</em> [in the persecution] <em class="underline">they loved not their <a id="l49"></a>lives unto the death.  Therefore rejoyce ye heavens &amp; ye that dwell <a id="l50"></a>in them</em> [the victors over the Dragon, as many of them as are <a id="l51"></a>truly Saints] <em class="underline">Wo to the inhabitants of the Earth &amp; Sea</em> [the hypocritical <a id="l52"></a>part of Christians &amp; such as should not endure the following temp<a id="l53"></a>tation] <em class="underline">for the Devil</em> [whom Michael cast out of heaven] <em class="underline">is</em> [by the <a id="l54"></a>flowing of dissembling heathens who say they are Christians &amp; are not <a id="l55"></a>but do lye] <em class="underline">come down unto you with great wrath because he know<a id="l56"></a>eth that he hath but a short time</em> [to reign among you untill he <a id="l57"></a>shall be cast in chains into the bottomless pitt] So then the Dragon <a id="l58"></a>in being cast out of heaven ceases not but begins a new reign on <a id="l59"></a>Earth among the Christian inhabitants of the Earth &amp; Sea, the Empire <a id="l60"></a>from these fals converts still keeping the Name of the Dragon &amp; the <a id="l61"></a>Manchild in being caught up to heaven soon vanishing out of sight. <a id="l62"></a>While the Empire continued heathen the small encouragements for <a id="l63"></a>hypocrites to turn  Christians was  a guard upon the Christian <a id="l64"></a>religion to keep it from growing corrupt.  For the mystery of ini<a id="l65"></a>quity which then worked could not grow to any maturity for want of <a id="l66"></a>hypocrites to work upon: but after that the heathen religion which thus <a id="l67"></a>withheld the revelation of this mystery, was taken out of the way, that <a id="l68"></a>mystery no longer wanting a fit people to work upon must begin to grow <a id="l69"></a>proportionally to the increase of hypocrites, &amp; so as in a short time by <a id="l70"></a>the prevailing of such fals Christians to be revealed.  For in a dayly <a id="l71"></a>flow of such converts into the Churches, it could not be but that in a <a id="l72"></a>few years the hypocrites would be more then double or triple to the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> sincere; not to say more then ten or twenty times their number.  Now <a id="l73"></a>by this influx of fals converts the mystery of iniquity grew in these <a id="l74"></a>respects.</p>
<p id="par4">First the Churches by the mixture &amp; allay of such converts soon <a id="l75"></a>became very corrupt in manners.  They that please to read the book <a id="l76"></a>of Salvian De Providentia Dei, an Author very sober cordate &amp; <a id="l77"></a>pious will find that within less then an hundred years after Con<a id="l78"></a>stantines victory, the Christians all over the Empire,  were grown as much  more debaucht in <a id="l80"></a>manners (whoring, sodomy, blasphemy, covetousness, voluptuousness drinking, swearing, lying,  backbiting, malice, fraud, <a id="l81"></a>injustice, rapine, oppression) then even the barbarous  heretical Christians.  This Salvian shews <a id="l83"></a>to satisfy his readers that God was just in subjecting the Romans to the <a id="l84"></a>violence &amp; dominion of the  barbarous Nations who in <a id="l85"></a>year 407 invaded the Western Empire.    Nor is't a wonder that Christians should <a id="l97"></a>become so vicious in so short a time seing the most immoral of the <a id="l98"></a>heathens would be most apt to turn Christians for interest, &amp; the <a id="l99"></a>most ambitious Christians would seek most for preferment in the <a id="l100"></a>Churches.  Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical history tells us that Christians <a id="l101"></a>between the persecutions of Decius &amp; Dioclesian through a respite <a id="l102"></a>of  a few years from persecution began to grow very corrupt <a id="l103"></a>in manners: &amp; much more would they grow corrupt in a more <a id="l104"></a>lasting peace when they were not only freed from persecution, but <a id="l105"></a>flourished in riches &amp; honours &amp; dominion over the world, &amp; were <a id="l106"></a>dayly assayed &amp; corrupted by the influx of the most hypocritical &amp; con<a id="l107"></a>sequently the worst of heathens.   <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span>   <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span>   It would require <a id="l167"></a>a large discourse to give a full account of the manners of these times, <a id="l168"></a>but I do not think it necessary: I shall content my self with two <a id="l169"></a>or three passages out of the writers of those times.</p>
<p id="par5">Gregory Nazianzen in his Oration Of the Bishops reprehends them <a id="l170"></a> as addicted to fals &amp; crafty perverting of right &amp; reason, con<a id="l171"></a>tentious, proud, as to knowledge rude &amp; unskilfull, as to faith ready to <a id="l172"></a>embrace either side being swayed by the laws not of God but of the times, <a id="l173"></a>flatterers, Lyons to the inferiour people &amp; fawning dogs to them in <a id="l174"></a>power, studious of eating &amp; drinking well, &amp; mindfull not of what is <a id="l175"></a>profitable but of what is gratefull to others, &amp; then he crys out: <em class="underline">O <a id="l176"></a>the mystery of godliness, which is now propagated almost throughout the <a id="l177"></a>whole world</em>. He describes also how there was no care in electing Men <a id="l178"></a>of deserts into Bishopricks, but any novice who could make an interest <a id="l179"></a>was admitted: yesterday at play &amp; publick spectacles, at horsraces, at <a id="l180"></a> dancing-bouts, at revellings, a publick Orator, a civil Ma<a id="l181"></a>gistrate, a soldier, to day created a Presbyter or Bishop.  Yesterday <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> a Simon Magus (buying a Bishoprick) to day a Simon Peter.  And much <a id="l182"></a>to the same purpose he speaks in his Oration to the second general Councel, <a id="l183"></a>&amp; in several of his verses.  And least you should think he did it out of <a id="l184"></a>peevishness for the loss of the Bishoprick of Constantinople, he touches <a id="l185"></a>upon the same immorality of the Clergy in his Oration, Of the praises of <a id="l186"></a>Basil, written about three years before: There is danger, saith he, <a id="l187"></a>least the most holy Order become most ridiculous.  For the Priesthood is ac<a id="l188"></a>quired not so much by virtue as by evil-doing &amp; wickedness: nor are the <a id="l189"></a>thrones of the most worthy but of the most powerfull. And  fifteen years before when <a id="l190"></a> upon his first return from the wilderness he was under his Father <a id="l191"></a>made Bishop of Nazianzum A.C. 360 in his Apology or first Oration <a id="l192"></a>(after the middle of it<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>) he is large upon the vices &amp; tempestuousness of <a id="l193"></a>that age wherein, saith he, the members are at war one with another, &amp; <a id="l194"></a>if there be any Charity yet remaining, it is departing; &amp; the Priesthood <a id="l195"></a>is an empty name, – &amp; we are all pious in this one thing that we condemn <a id="l196"></a>others of impiety – &amp; he is accounted best that can fasten most reproaches <a id="l197"></a>upon his Neighbour. – We observe one anothers faults not to lament  <a id="l198"></a>'em but to expose 'em, not to cure 'em but to inflict new wounds, &amp; thence <a id="l199"></a>draw excuses for our own vices.  Neither do we account Men good or evil <a id="l200"></a>according to their lives but according to friendship or enmity &amp; what we <a id="l201"></a>praise to day we dispraise to morrow, &amp; what we note for infamous in <a id="l202"></a>others we admire in our selves &amp; easily pardon any wickedness in those who <a id="l203"></a>embrace impiety.  Thus magnanimous are we in vice.  And all things are <a id="l204"></a>in confusion like the world in the first Chaos, or like Men in a nocturnal fight <a id="l205"></a>where they cannot know their Friends from their Enemies or in a sea fight &amp; storm wherein they perish in great confusion by falling foul on one another.  And as the people <a id="l206"></a>is, so is the Priest &amp; so are the Nobles.  There are who quarrel about <a id="l207"></a>trifles &amp; then engage parties, pretending the faith &amp; so profaning the holy <a id="l208"></a>Name for private ends.  Whence it comes to pass that we are grown odious <a id="l209"></a>to the Gentiles &amp; (which is worst of all) we can give no reason why not <a id="l210"></a>justly &amp; deservedly: &amp; even to the more honest of our own party we are <a id="l211"></a>infamous.  We are become a new kind of spectacle not to Angels &amp; Men, <a id="l212"></a>but to almost all the wicked in all times &amp; places, in the Markets, in Feasts, <a id="l213"></a>in  pleasures, in mournings.  And now  we are also acted upon the <a id="l214"></a>Stages (which I speak almost weeping) &amp; are derided with the most impure &amp; <a id="l215"></a>unchast; nor is there any scene so pleasing to the ear &amp; eye as when a <a id="l216"></a>Christian is comically exposed.  Also in the same Epistle before the middle <a id="l217"></a>describing how novices every where were exalted in the Church, he saith; <a id="l218"></a>We are so ill affected that the most of us (not to say all) almost before we <a id="l219"></a>cast off our first hair, &amp; cease to babble like Children, before we enter <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> into the divine Courts, before we know so much as the names of the Books of <a id="l220"></a>sacred scripture, before we know the Characters of the old &amp; new Testaments <a id="l221"></a>or the Authors (for I do not yet say before we have washt away the spot <a id="l222"></a>of our Sins) if we have learnt two or three pious words &amp; those not by <a id="l223"></a>reading but by hearing alone, or if we have learnt to sing a Psalm or <a id="l224"></a>two or to contract a cloak well or put on a Monastic girdle a little for <a id="l225"></a>a shew of piety (O the chief seates &amp; the high-mindedness!  For Samuel <a id="l226"></a>was  holy from his cradle,) we are presently Wisemen &amp; Masters <a id="l227"></a>&amp; sublime in divine things &amp; the chief among the scribes &amp; Lawyers, <a id="l228"></a>&amp; ordain our selves heavenly men &amp; affect to be called Rabbi; nor is <a id="l229"></a>there any thing spoke literally in the Scriptures, but all things are to <a id="l230"></a>be understood mystically, &amp; if for this we be not praised &amp; extolled <a id="l231"></a>we are angry.   These are the manners of those who have most of good<a id="l232"></a>ness &amp; simplicity among us.  For those who are more spiritual &amp; generous, <a id="l233"></a>much condemning us &amp; vexing us &amp; accounting us triflers of no value, <a id="l234"></a>depart from us despising our communion as the communion of Men not <a id="l235"></a>pious.  Thus Gregory of the Churches of that early age.  In his other writings <a id="l236"></a>he describes a vehement contention between the eastern &amp; western Churches, <a id="l237"></a>both in the Councel of Constantinople (which in his Epistle  to Olympius<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> <a id="l238"></a>he calls  πάσης ἀνατολικης κὶ δυτικης σύνοδον an universal Councel <a id="l239"></a>of both the Eastern &amp; Western Churches) &amp; before &amp; after.  And being af<a id="l240"></a>terward invited to Synods he wrote in a letter to Saturninus: <sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup>All things <a id="l241"></a>by Gods blessing are well with us, this one thing excepted, that we are anxious <a id="l242"></a>&amp; sollicitous about the Churches so filthily at variance.  Reduce 'em if <a id="l243"></a>you can by any means to concord seing the Bishops meet again: for it is to <a id="l244"></a>be feared again least we now be shamed if this Synod has no happier an <a id="l245"></a>end then the former.    And to Procopius;<sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> that he never saw a <a id="l246"></a>happy event of any councel, they increasing rather then averting evils.  <a id="l247"></a>For saith he, the contentious &amp; desirous of dominion are pertinacious <a id="l248"></a>beyond what can be explained by my words.    <sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup>And to Theodorus <a id="l249"></a>Bishop of Tyana: That he declined coming to Synods &amp; conferences <a id="l250"></a>ever since he found many of them (to speak sparingly) wicked &amp; <a id="l251"></a>flagitious.  ‡<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 6v &gt; </span> ‡ In the Councel of Nice there was such traducing &amp; libelling one another that <a id="l252"></a>nothing could be done till the Emperor Constantine came himself in person <a id="l253"></a>&amp; moderated.  And therefore in the Councel of Tyre to prevent the like <a id="l254"></a>discords ordered a Prefect to be present there with a band of soldiers at <a id="l255"></a>hand.  And in the following Councels where <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>t<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>his method was not taken, there <a id="l256"></a>were such doings as Gregory describes.  Which made him in his poems compare <a id="l257"></a>the convening Bishops to Cranes &amp; Geese &amp; pertinacious warriors &amp; profane <a id="l258"></a>stageplayers only drest in the habit of Bishops.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 7r resumes &gt; </span>  These ecclesiastical feuds &amp; calamities so much <a id="l259"></a>complained of by Gregory &amp; others of the same kind are mentioned <a id="l260"></a>by Socrates in the preface to the fifth book of his Ecclesiastical History <a id="l261"></a>as judgments of God upon the age for their wickedness.  And the like manners <a id="l262"></a>of the Western Bishops amongst themselves, Sulpitius Severus (who wrote about <a id="l263"></a>the yeare 400) makes this mention. <sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>  Ac inter nostros perpetuum discordiarum <a id="l264"></a>bellum exarserat: quod jam per quindecim annos fœdis dissentionibus agitatum, <a id="l265"></a>nullo modo sopiri poterat. Et nunc, ut maximè discordijs Episcoporum turbari <a id="l266"></a>aut misceri omnia cernerentur, cunctaque per eos odi, aut gratia, metu, inconstantia <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> invidia, factione, libidine, avaritia, arrogantia, desidia, essent depravata, <a id="l267"></a>postremo plures aadversus paucos bene consulentes; insanis consilijs &amp; perti<a id="l268"></a>nacibus studijs certabant: inter haec plebs Dei et optimus quisque probro <a id="l269"></a>atque ludibrio habebatur. And in another place, speaking of the manners <a id="l270"></a>of the Clergy, he saith, <sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup>Præcepti hujus [ut servirent Deo] non solum immemores <a id="l271"></a>sed etiam ignari mihi videntur tanta hoc tempore animos eorum habendi <a id="l272"></a>cupido veluti tabes incessit.  Inhiant possessionibus, prædia excolunt, auro <a id="l273"></a>incubant, emunt venduntque, quæstui per omnia student.  At siqui melioris <a id="l274"></a>propositi videntur, neque possidentes neque negociantes, quod est multo turpius <a id="l275"></a>sedentes munera expectant, atque omne vitæ decus mercede corruptum <a id="l276"></a>habent dum quasi venalem præferunt sanctitatem.  Sed longius quam <a id="l277"></a>volui egressus sum dum me temporum nostrorum piget tædetque And <a id="l278"></a>again in describing the Persecution of Dioclesian: <sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup>Multo avidius tunc martyria <a id="l279"></a>gloriosis mortibus quærebantur quàm nunc Episcopatus pravis ambitionibus <a id="l280"></a>appetuntur.  So also Saint Augustine: <sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup>Multi sunt qui gemunt –  et dolent ob iniquitates quæ fiunt in medio eorum, volentes <a id="l282"></a>resistere sed timore secularium rerum non audentes, quas adhuc vel adipisci <a id="l283"></a>desiderat humana fragilitas vel amittere formidat infirmitas – quod rem <a id="l284"></a>non timendam timent, omnes declinarunt, simul omnes inutiles facti <a id="l285"></a>sunt: quia plus æstimatur timor hominis quam timor Dei, et præferunt <a id="l286"></a>homines res quas acceperunt a Deo ipsi Deo. – In ipso fine rerum posita <a id="l287"></a>est in  universa provincia, et quotidie frequentantur spectacula,  sanguis <a id="l288"></a>hominum  quotidie funditur in mundo et insanientium voces increpant in <a id="l289"></a>circo – Meritò omnes sub flagello conterimur et doctor et factor, et au<a id="l290"></a>ditor et contemptor.

So Sidonius <a id="l296"></a>Apollinaris ascribes the sinking of the western Empire under the Barbarians <a id="l297"></a>to the exactions &amp; vices of the Romans, &amp; that the Bishops study not the publick <a id="l298"></a>but their private fortune, &amp; the governors oppress the people.  Those <a id="l299"></a>Authors I have cited who write before Salvian that you may see he is not <a id="l300"></a>alone in lamenting the vices of his age.  For if the degenerating Romans <a id="l301"></a>were so bad in their times, they were wors in his.  To tell you what he <a id="l302"></a>says of them would be to transcribe his book, &amp; therefore I had <a id="l303"></a>rather send you to it: I shall content my self to note that after <a id="l304"></a>many things said of the vices of several provinces he at length <a id="l305"></a>comes to compare the Romans with the Barbarians, Duo genera, saith <a id="l306"></a>he, in omni gente omnium Barbarorum sunt, id est aut hæreticorum <a id="l307"></a>aut Paganorum.  His ergo omnibus quantum ad legem divinam pertinet <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> 
 Dico vos sine comparatione meliores: quantum autem ad vitam <a id="l308"></a>et actus doleo ac plango esse pejores. – Præter religiosos ac nonnullos etiam <a id="l309"></a>seculares religiosis pares, cæteros aut omnes aut pene omnes majoris reatus <a id="l310"></a>dico &amp; criminatioris vitæ esse quam barbari.  Irascens forsitan qui hæc <a id="l311"></a>legis &amp; condemnas insuper quæ legis.  Non refugio censuram tuam: condemna <a id="l312"></a>si mentior, condemna si non probavero.  For the proof of this I referr <a id="l313"></a>you to the Book where you will find it explained; first of the heathen <a id="l314"></a>Barbarians how  several nations being noted for peculiar vices, as the <a id="l315"></a>Saxons for ferity, the Franks for perfidy, the Huns for unchastity, the <a id="l316"></a>Alans for drunkenness, the Alans for rapacity, the Roman Nation is more <a id="l317"></a>criminal in all these things, because they do against a known Law, what <a id="l318"></a>the other doe out of ignorance: then at large  comparing the Romans &amp; the Christian Barbarians <a id="l319"></a>how that the Romans generally hate, envy, &amp; vex one another, the Barbarians <a id="l320"></a>of the same Nation love one another; the Romans are intollerable in ex<a id="l321"></a>actions, oppressions &amp; injustice, the Barbarians (&amp; particularly the Goths, <a id="l322"></a>Vandals, Franks, &amp; Huns) are free from these crimes; the Romans fre<a id="l323"></a>quent Theaters and Shows, the Barbarians suffer them not so much as in <a id="l324"></a>the Roman Cities which come into their power; the Romans are ungrateful <a id="l325"></a>to God for their victories, &amp; other blessings, not giving him thanks but <a id="l326"></a>attributing them to fortune or conduct, the Goths &amp; Vandals do not so; <a id="l327"></a>the Romans are extreamly unchast, &amp; which is worst they are so amidst the <a id="l328"></a>chast Barbarians, &amp; by their unchastity offend them.  Amongst the Goth's <a id="l329"></a>a fornicator is not tollerated, the Romans only (by the prejudice of their <a id="l330"></a>Name and Nation) excepted.  Almost all the Romans do these things of which it <a id="l331"></a>is hard to find but a few Barbarians guilty.  To Salvian I might add <a id="l332"></a>Gildas &amp; other Authors: but I shall rather confirm their testimonies <a id="l333"></a>with matter of fact in the following instances.</p>
<p id="par6">Victor in the second book of his history of the Vandalick persecution relates <a id="l334"></a>how that when the King of the Vandals was minded to persecute the Africans <a id="l335"></a>he caused their sacred Virgins to be searched by Midwifes, &amp; those who <a id="l336"></a>were found vitiated to be urged by questions &amp; tortures till they had <a id="l337"></a>confessed who had layn with them saying, <em class="underline">Tell us how your Bishops &amp; <a id="l338"></a>Clergymen lye with you.  For</em>, saith Victor, <em class="underline">he endeavoured to find a way <a id="l339"></a>to begin that persecution which he made</em>.  And thereupon were 5000 Bishops <a id="l340"></a>Priests &amp; Deacons &amp; other Members of the African Church sent at <a id="l341"></a>once into banishment.  Now as the Vandals designed by this means to <a id="l342"></a>blemish the African Church, so the Africans laboured on the other hand <a id="l343"></a>to purge themselves by celebrating all these both Virgins &amp; others for <a id="l344"></a>Confessors &amp; Martyrs.  For whilst Salvian tells us that the Romans were <a id="l345"></a>abominably unchast &amp; the Africans the unchastest of all the Romans, &amp; that <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>God's judgment was manifest in making<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> Vandals lord over them who were the chastest of all the Barbarians, &amp; by their <a id="l346"></a>laws had almost made the Africans chast: I leave the Reader to consider <a id="l347"></a>whether the Africans were not guilty of a double crime, unchastity in <a id="l348"></a>the Virgins &amp; those who were banished, &amp; the patronizing of unchastity by <a id="l349"></a>the rest who celebrated such for holy Men &amp; confessors: a practise which <a id="l350"></a>the Roman Church has ever since followed in sanctifying those who suffer <a id="l351"></a>by the hand of justice when ever she thinks it her interest to do so.</p>
<p id="par7">Basil &amp; Gregory Nazianzen while they speak much of the persecution <a id="l352"></a>of the Emperor Valens, they sometimes let fall words from whence it ap<a id="l353"></a>pears that the persecution consisted in punishing Men not directly for religion, <a id="l354"></a>but upon accusations of various crimes.  Now in an age wherein all men <a id="l355"></a>(as Nazianzen &amp; Saint Austin saith)  accused one another, &amp; few <a id="l356"></a>justly excused themselves, how far the objected crimes were true or the wit<a id="l357"></a>nesses fals I cannot determine.  But be it as it will the immorality of <a id="l358"></a>the one side or the other or both is hence argued, &amp; if either party was <a id="l359"></a>then grown immoral, the other scarce continued vertuous.</p>
<p id="par8">In the end of the reign of Constantius, The Egyptian Christians assembled <a id="l360"></a>in a Church of Alexandria resisted &amp; beat the Emperors Soldiers sent <a id="l361"></a>against them &amp; hung up their arms in the Church in triumph, &amp; sent about a letter <a id="l362"></a>to stir up the people to their assistence, saying that they had already resisted <a id="l363"></a>unto blood. (all which you may see in their letter extant in the works of <a id="l364"></a>Saint Athanasius) &amp; then  were overcome by fresh supplys of Soldiers &amp; <a id="l365"></a>the ringleaders taken &amp; sentenced for the disturbance, some to imprisonment <a id="l366"></a>some to be whipt, some to death: The greatness of this sedition Hilary in his book against Constantius written in the last year of that Emperor thus describes: Adest mecum Alexandria tot concussa bellis, tantum commotorum expeditionum pavens tumultum.  Brevius enim adversum Persam quàm adversum eam armis certatum est.  Mutati Præfecti, electi duces, corrupti populi, commotæ legiones ne ab Athanasio Christus prædicaretur. So long as this war lasted against the city so long you may be sure the City was in arms against their Emperor.  And such was the Spirit of  these Egyptians, that when Valens would have expelled Athanasius again, he durst not for fear of a new war.  Now it seems to me a very great argument <a id="l367"></a>of the levity &amp; corruptness of those times, first for  the Alexandrine Christians to behave themselves <a id="l368"></a>so  seditiously &amp; then for  the Churches of that age to patronize &amp; encourage such doings by celebrating all those for Martyrs &amp; Con<a id="l369"></a>fessors  who were punished for it.  And if it be suspected that any of them <a id="l370"></a>suffered otherwise then  upon accusations for rebellion or other crimes, the Reader may inform <a id="l371"></a>himself otherwise out of Saint Athanasius .  For Athanasius <a id="l372"></a>two or three years after speaking of these  things &amp; of some new stir in Egypt, made (if I guess right) at  some news about the Councel of Ariminum, writes thus: <em class="underline">Be it so,</em> saith he, <em class="underline">that against <a id="l375"></a>Athanasius &amp; other Bishops which they have sent into banishment they <a id="l376"></a>could feign fals pretexts of crimes; yet what will they say to this <a id="l377"></a>new kind of evil</em>. [And Hilary in his book against Constantius written in the last <a id="l378"></a>yeare of that Emperors reign   <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span>   If the Bishops were not banished but <a id="l394"></a>upon being arraigned &amp; condemned for crimes, much less did the <a id="l395"></a>inferior people suffer directly for religion.  I know some will <a id="l396"></a>be offended that I lay open these things, but in being so they <a id="l397"></a>shew themselves to be men of such a spirit as I am descri<a id="l398"></a>bing, that is who are for colouring over &amp; sanctifying crimes when they think <a id="l399"></a>it makes for their interest.</p>
