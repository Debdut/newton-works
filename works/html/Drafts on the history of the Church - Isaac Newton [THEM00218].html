<p id="par2"> But for understanding how <a id="l21"></a>this Article came into the Creed, I should acquaint you <a id="l22"></a>that Athanasius being accused of several crimes by the <a id="l23"></a>Meletians &amp; condemned for them by the Council of Tyre &amp; <a id="l24"></a>banished into Gallia by Constantine the great A.C. 335, &amp; <a id="l25"></a>sent back into Egypt by his son Constantine A.C. 338, &amp; this Constantine the  son being <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> A.C. 340 the Council <a id="l26"></a>of Antioch which  consisted of about 97 bishops &amp; met in the <a id="l27"></a>beginning of the next Spring A.C. 341  made one Gregory bishop of Alexandria in the room of Athanasius &amp; sent an account of these proceedings to the emperors &amp; Churches for their approbation as was usual &amp; Athanasius at the same time calling a Council of about 90 Bishops <a id="l29"></a>of Egypt &amp; Libya wrote also  to the Churches in his own defense <a id="l30"></a> While the Legates of both parties were going with the Letters to  Rome, the Eastern Emperor Constantius sent Gregory to Alexandria with an armed force at <a id="l32"></a>Easter, &amp; then Athanasius fled to Rome, as did also Paul of Constantinople, Marcellus of Ancyra &amp; Asclepas of Gaza whom the Eastern <a id="l34"></a>Bishops had also deposed.  These bishops appealed from the Eastern Councils to Iulius Bishop of Rome, <a id="l35"></a> &amp; he accepted of the appeal examined them, received them into communion &amp; called a Council of about 50 or 60 Bishops of Italy &amp; <a id="l36"></a>the parts adjacent to meet at Rome A.C. 342 &amp; cited the <a id="l37"></a>eastern Bishops then met in the said Council of Antioch to <a id="l38"></a>appear  in this Council &amp; justify their proceedings. The <a id="l39"></a>eastern Bishops came not, but wrote back to Iulius a reprimanding <a id="l40"></a>Letter, telling him that they were his equals &amp; their synods had an <a id="l41"></a>unshaken authority &amp; the Iudge is used reproachfully whose judgment <a id="l42"></a>is reexamined; that when the western Bishops condemned Novatian <a id="l43"></a>the eastern acquiesced &amp; when the eastern condemned Paul of Sa<a id="l44"></a>mosat the western acquiesced; that to communicate with persons ex<a id="l45"></a>communicated by others without the consent of those who excommunicated <a id="l46"></a>them is criminal by the constitutions of the Church; &amp; that if he desisted <a id="l47"></a>they would have peace with him, otherwise not. When the Council <a id="l48"></a>met at Rome &amp; the eastern Bishops came not, the Council communicated with <a id="l49"></a>Athanasius &amp; the rest as Iulius had done before, &amp; Iulius by their <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span>  order wrote back to the eastern Bishops complaining of the <a id="l50"></a>sharpness of their Letter,  of their not coming to the Council <a id="l51"></a>&amp; of their favouring the Arians &amp; defending Athanasius at large, &amp; blaming them for acting <a id="l52"></a>in their Councils in matters of such consequence without giving <a id="l53"></a>him notice to whom it belonged to do justice. <em class="underline">Cur igitur</em>, saith <a id="l54"></a>he, <em class="underline">et imprimis de Alexandrina civitate nihil nobis scribere <a id="l55"></a>voluistis? An ignari estis hanc consuetudinem esse ut primum no<a id="l56"></a>bis scribatur, ut hinc quod justum est definiri possit? Quapropter <a id="l57"></a>si istic hujusmodi suspicio in Episcopum concepta fuerat, id huc <a id="l58"></a>ad nostram ecclesiam referri oportuit</em>. Thus Iulius in  <a id="l59"></a>contending for the universal Bishopric, gained the Bishops of <a id="l60"></a>Italy to his party together with the friends of Athanasius &amp; some <a id="l61"></a>others in Egypt Libya &amp; some other places, &amp; persisted in his designe.</p>
<p id="par3">About four year after when by spreading a clamour <a id="l62"></a>against the eastern Bishops as if they were Arians, <a id="l63"></a>the party of the Bishop of Rome was sufficiently encreased, the <a id="l64"></a>Emperors by the working of the western Bishops were induced to call <a id="l65"></a>a general Council to meet the next year A.C. 347, at <a id="l66"></a>Serdica a city in the confine of both Empires to examin <a id="l67"></a>the matter, but first to treat of the faith. And there came <a id="l68"></a>thither about 80 eastern  &amp; a much greater number of <a id="l69"></a>western  &amp; Egyptian Bishops. But before the two parties <a id="l70"></a>met the eastern hearing that the Western communicated <a id="l71"></a>with Athanasius Marcellus &amp; some others who stood excommuni<a id="l72"></a>cated by them, sent to them several times to dismiss the excommunicated persons from their assembly. And the western Bishops on the other <a id="l73"></a>hand summoned the eastern several times to come to the barr <a id="l74"></a>of their tribunal &amp; justify their proceedings against Athanasius <a id="l75"></a>&amp; the rest. And when neither party would yeild, five of <a id="l76"></a>the six eastern Bishops who had been sent by the Council <a id="l77"></a>of Tyre into Egypt to examin the matters of Athanasius upon the place <a id="l78"></a>proposed to the western that an equal number of Bishops of both <a id="l79"></a>parties should be sent from Serdica into Egypt to reexamin <a id="l80"></a>the matter upon the place; &amp; if the report which they had <a id="l81"></a>made to the Council of Tyre proved false then they would <a id="l82"></a>quietly submit to be excommunicated without ever complaining <a id="l83"></a>to any  Emperor Council or Bishop, &amp; if their report was found true then five of <a id="l84"></a>the western Bishops who absolved Athanasius should be excom<a id="l85"></a>municated without ever complaining. But this proposal <a id="l86"></a>would not be accepted. Nothing would satisfy the western Bishops <a id="l87"></a>but to make themselves &amp; the excommunicated persons judges <a id="l88"></a>over the eastern. And therefor the eastern Bishops seeing that <a id="l89"></a>the western  would not joyn with them <a id="l90"></a>in Council to hear the excommunicated persons at the barr <a id="l91"></a>but contended for preeminence &amp; dominion, went back from <a id="l92"></a>Serdica to Philippopolis, &amp; both parties writing circulatory letters in defence <a id="l93"></a>of their own proceedings, the western in their letter <a id="l94"></a>accused the eastern as guilty both because they appeared <a id="l95"></a>not when Iulius cited them &amp; because they now fled from <a id="l96"></a>justice. They declared also in the same letter their faith <a id="l97"></a>of one ὀυσία &amp; one ὑπόστασις of the father  son &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> holy Ghost, &amp; the equality of the Son to the ffather &amp; his <a id="l98"></a>assumption of a man. They made some Canons also in which <a id="l99"></a>they decreed that appeals might be made  to the Bishop of Rome <a id="l100"></a>from all Councils not called by him; &amp; by doing so they submitted all their <a id="l101"></a>churches to his authority, constituting him their Oecumenical Bishop &amp; <a id="l102"></a>themselves Roman Catholicks; &amp; endeavoured that the eastern Chur<a id="l103"></a>ches should be brought into the same subjection.</p>
<p id="par4"><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> It was proposed also in this Council that a new profession of <a id="l104"></a> faith should be published for supplying what was wanting to the Ni<a id="l105"></a>cene Profession; &amp; Sozomen tells us<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup>  that they did compose a new form <a id="l106"></a>of faith prolixer then the Nicene but conteining the same opini<a id="l107"></a>on &amp; not much differing in words, &amp; that Hosius &amp; Protogenes wrote <a id="l108"></a>to Iulius Bishop of Rome that they confirmed the Nicene faith, but <a id="l109"></a>for greater perspicuity explained it more at large that the Arians <a id="l110"></a>might not abuse the brevity in which it was written &amp; draw it to <a id="l111"></a>an absurd sense. And certainly a new profession of faith was <a id="l112"></a>published &amp; handed about for some years in the name of this <a id="l113"></a>Council, &amp; I mistake if it was not the following Creed. <em class="underline">We beleive <a id="l114"></a>in one God, the ffather Almighty, the maker of all things visible <a id="l115"></a>&amp; invisible; &amp; in one Lord Iesus Christ the son of God, begotten <a id="l116"></a>of the father, the only begotten, that is of the substance of the father, God of God, light of light, very God of very God, <a id="l117"></a>begotten not made, consubstantial to the father by whom all things <a id="l118"></a>were made which are in heaven &amp; in earth, visible &amp; invisible: <a id="l119"></a>who for us men &amp; for our salvation  descended, was incar<a id="l120"></a>nate &amp; made man, that is, begotten perfectly of Mary always <a id="l121"></a>a Virgin by the holy Ghost: who had truly &amp; not only in <a id="l122"></a>appearance a body soul &amp; mind &amp; all things which are <a id="l123"></a>in men except sin: who suffered, that is, was crucified <a id="l124"></a>buried &amp; rose again the third day &amp; ascended into hea<a id="l125"></a>ven in glory in the same body: sitteth at the right <a id="l126"></a>hand of the father &amp; shall come again in the same body <a id="l127"></a>in glory to judge the quick &amp; the dead, of whose kingdom <a id="l128"></a>there shall be no end. And we beleive in the holy Ghost <a id="l129"></a>who is not alien from the ffather &amp; the Son but is <a id="l130"></a>consubstantial to the ffather &amp; the Son; who is un<a id="l131"></a>created, perfect, the Paraclete, who spake in the Law <a id="l132"></a>&amp; in the Prophets &amp; in the Gospells, who descended on <a id="l133"></a>Iourdan, preached to the Apostles, dwelt in the saints. <a id="l134"></a>And we beleive in this one only catholick &amp; Apostolick <a id="l135"></a>Church, in one baptism for the remission of sins, in the <a id="l136"></a>resurrection of the dead in eternal judgment of souls &amp; <a id="l137"></a>bodies, in the kingdom of heaven &amp; in life everlasting. <a id="l138"></a>But those who say there was a time when the son was <a id="l139"></a>not, or there was a time when the holy Ghost was not, <a id="l140"></a>or that he was made out of nothing, or that the son of <a id="l141"></a>God or holy Ghost was of another</em> ὑπόστασις <em class="underline">or another</em> <a id="l142"></a>ὀυσία, <em class="underline">or mutable or variable, We anathematize because <a id="l143"></a>our catholick mother &amp; Apostolick Church anathematizes <a id="l144"></a>them. And We anathematize all those who confess not the <a id="l145"></a>resurrection of the flesh, &amp; every heresy, that is, all those <a id="l146"></a>who do not hold this faith of the holy &amp; only Catholick</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span>  <em class="underline">Church</em>.  This Creed was found in a very old parchment Manu<a id="l147"></a>script in the Vatican amongst the works of Cyrill &amp; in <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>another<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> MS in the king of France's library &amp; printed in the works of Athanasius <a id="l148"></a>at Paris A.C. 1698,<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup>  &amp; was certainly composed before the meeting <a id="l149"></a>of the Council of Alexandria A.C. 362. For it uses the <a id="l150"></a>language of one hypostasis of the father son &amp; Holy Ghost, which <a id="l151"></a>language was abolished in that Council. In the Manuscript it <a id="l152"></a>is attributed to Athanasius but runs in the plural number, <em class="underline">We <a id="l153"></a>beleive &amp;c</em>, &amp; after the manner of a Creed made by a Council <a id="l154"></a>anathematizes  hereticks, &amp; has all the characters of the <a id="l155"></a>Serdican Creed. ffor it is the Nicene Creed enlarged with the <a id="l156"></a>Serdican faith &amp; with so much of the Creed of the Latines <a id="l157"></a>called the Apostles Creed as was then wanting in the Ni<a id="l158"></a>cene &amp; therefore was made by Athanasius &amp; the Latines <a id="l159"></a>together for completing the Nicene Creed. And it uses the word <a id="l160"></a>ὑπόστασις in such a sense as no other Council did besides <a id="l161"></a>that of Serdica. And as the Serdican fathers proposed only <a id="l162"></a>by their Creed to confirm the Nicene &amp; explain it more at <a id="l163"></a>large, so this Creed above recited is in the Manuscript called <a id="l164"></a>an Interpretation upon the holy Creed. I have therefore <a id="l165"></a>recited it  as the oldest Creed in which the ffather Son &amp; holy <a id="l166"></a>Ghost are declared consubstantial.</p>
<p id="par5">The Council of Serdica being convened by the Emperors <a id="l167"></a>to treat of the faith in the first place, the eastern Bishops <a id="l168"></a>also in their return from Serdica published a profession <a id="l169"></a>of their faith composed about two years before by a <a id="l170"></a>Counsil at Antioch: which Profession was as follows. We beleive in one God the father Almighty the  creator  &amp; maker of all things from whom all pa<a id="l171"></a>ternity in heaven &amp; earth is named, &amp; in his only <a id="l172"></a>begotten son our Lord Iesus Christ, begotten of the <a id="l173"></a>father before all ages, God of God, light of light <a id="l174"></a> by whom all things were made <a id="l175"></a>in heaven &amp; in earth visible &amp; invisible; who is <a id="l176"></a>the Word, the wisdom the power the life &amp; the true <a id="l177"></a>light; who in the last days, for us, was made man, <a id="l178"></a>&amp; born of the holy Virgin. crucified dead &amp; buried <a id="l179"></a>&amp; rose again from the dead the third day &amp; was <a id="l180"></a>taken up into heaven &amp; sitteth at the right hand <a id="l181"></a>of God the ffather, who shall come in the end of <a id="l182"></a>ages to judge the quick &amp; the dead &amp; to give unto <a id="l183"></a>every one according to his works, whose kingdom <a id="l184"></a>without intermission continues to endless ages. For <a id="l185"></a>he sitteth at the right hand of the ffather, not only <a id="l186"></a>in this world but also in that which is to come. We <a id="l187"></a>beleive also in the holy Ghost, that is, in the Para<a id="l188"></a>clete, whom Christ, having promised him to his Apostles, <a id="l189"></a>after his resurrection sent to teach them &amp; admonish <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> them all things, by whom also the souls of those  <a id="l190"></a>are sanctified who sincerely beleive in him. But <a id="l191"></a>those who say the Son was of nothing, or of another <a id="l192"></a>substance &amp; not of God, or that there was a time <a id="l193"></a>or age when he was not, the Catholick Church <a id="l194"></a>accounts alien from her; &amp; those likewise who say <a id="l195"></a>there are three Gods, or that Christ was not God be<a id="l196"></a>fore the ages, or that he is neither Christ nor the <a id="l197"></a>son of God, or that the ffather Son &amp; holy Ghost are <a id="l198"></a>the same, or that the Son is unbegotten, or that <a id="l199"></a>the ffather did not beget the Son by his Counsel &amp; <a id="l200"></a>will the holy &amp; catholick Church anathematizes.</p>
<p id="par6">This profession of faith Hilary approved &amp; commend<a id="l201"></a>ed as made in short but most absolute definitions. And <a id="l202"></a>hitherto the  Churches of the Greeks &amp; Latines <a id="l203"></a>had continued united in external communion through<a id="l204"></a>out the whole Roman Empire; but now they began <a id="l205"></a>to separate, the Latines being offended that the Greeks <a id="l206"></a>called the ffather &amp; Son &amp; holy Ghost three hypostases <a id="l207"></a>&amp; omitted the word ὁμοούσιος in their Creeds, &amp; the <a id="l208"></a>Greeks that the Latines translated it unius hypostasis <a id="l209"></a>absolved persons excommunicated by the Greek Church <a id="l210"></a>&amp; endeavoured to subject that Church to the autho<a id="l211"></a>rity of the Bishop of Rome, &amp; both parties that <a id="l212"></a>five or six of the principal Bishops of their party <a id="l213"></a>were excommunicated by those of the other party.</p>
<p id="par7">Six years after these things were done Constan<a id="l214"></a>tius conquered Magnentius the successor of his brother <a id="l215"></a>Constance in the western Empire, &amp; two years after <a id="l216"></a>that conquest called a Council of above 300 Bishops <a id="l217"></a>at Millain to subscribe the condemnation of Atha<a id="l218"></a>nasius. They offered to subscribe if the Nicene faith <a id="l219"></a>might be first confirmed, but were made to <a id="l220"></a>understand that nothing could be regularly debated or proceed <a id="l221"></a>in Councils till they quitted the communion of per<a id="l222"></a>sons excommunicated  that the <a id="l224"></a>Emperor called them together for that purpose  &amp; <a id="l225"></a>they could not go upon other things till they had <a id="l226"></a>his leave, that the wilful communicating with persons <a id="l227"></a>who stood excommunicated by others was contrary to the <a id="l228"></a>rules of the Church &amp; of a criminal nature, &amp; that <a id="l229"></a>those who persisted in such communion, must expect, for <a id="l230"></a>restoring the peace of the Church disturbed by them to be <a id="l231"></a>banished as criminals. Whereupon they all subscribed <a id="l232"></a>except Paulinus Tervirensis, Eusebius Vercellensis, Dionysius <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> Mediolanensis, Lucifer Calaritanus, &amp; Rhodanius, who <a id="l233"></a>were therefore banished as was also Liberius bishop <a id="l234"></a>of Rome &amp; Hosius of Corduba a little after &amp; Hilary <a id="l235"></a>&amp; Dosanus a year after. And all these offered to <a id="l236"></a>subscribe if the Nicene faith were confirmed first <a id="l237"></a>&amp; thereby they allowed that they could subscribe with <a id="l238"></a>a good conscience. There were also Councils called <a id="l239"></a>at Arles &amp; Biters in Gallia &amp; at Aquileia, and <a id="l240"></a>Messengers sent with publick notaries to take the <a id="l241"></a>subscriptions of the rest of the Bishops who staid <a id="l242"></a>at home. Hosius also &amp; Liberius after they had <a id="l243"></a>been a year or two in banishment subscribed. And <a id="l244"></a>thus the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome set up <a id="l245"></a>by the Councils of Rome &amp; Serdica over the eastern <a id="l246"></a>Churches fell, the Bishop of Rome himself with <a id="l247"></a>all the western Bishops except seven or eight &amp; all <a id="l248"></a>their Presbyters except a few, subscribing &amp; thereby <a id="l249"></a>acknowledging the supreme &amp; absolute judicial <a id="l250"></a>authority of the Councils of the Greek churches <a id="l251"></a>over her own members</p>
<p id="par8">But over the Latine Churches of the Con<a id="l252"></a>substantial faith in Europe, the supremacy of <a id="l253"></a>the Bishop of Rome still remained being no ways <a id="l254"></a>opposed by Constantius or the Greek Church. And <a id="l255"></a>thence it came to pass that when the western <a id="l256"></a>Empire was invaded by several barbarous nations, <a id="l257"></a>those nations, particularly the Franks in Gallia, <a id="l258"></a>the Goths in Spain  the Lombards in Italy, &amp; the Saxons in Britain as <a id="l259"></a>fast as they became converted to the consubstan<a id="l260"></a>tial faith, subjected their Churches to the authority <a id="l261"></a>of the Bishop of Rome. And all this was done before <a id="l262"></a>the Greek Emperor Phocas granted him the universal <a id="l263"></a>Bishoprick over the Churches also of his Empire.</p>
<p id="par9">After the authority of the Greek Church over <a id="l264"></a>her own members was restored, new Councils were called to <a id="l265"></a>reconcile the Churches about the faith, &amp; for that end they <a id="l266"></a>abolished the use of the word ὀυσία with its compounds ὁμοούσιος <a id="l267"></a>&amp; ὁμοιούσιος which had given occasion to the discord. This was <a id="l268"></a>first done by the Council of Sirmium A.C. 357 in a Creed <a id="l269"></a>subscribed by Hosius.  &amp; then in another  Council of <a id="l270"></a>Sirmium A.C. 359 in a Creed in which they professed the Son <a id="l271"></a>to be <em class="underline">similis Patri secundum scripturas</em>. This Creed was published <a id="l272"></a> in the presence of the Emperor at Sirmium &amp; <a id="l273"></a>subscribed the same year by the Councils of Nice in Thrace <a id="l274"></a>&amp; Ariminum in Italy. A copy thereof is set down above. The <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> Council of Seleucia meeting the same year subscri<a id="l275"></a>bed the Creed of Lucius the Martyr with a preface in <a id="l276"></a>which they abolished the use of those words &amp; declared the son to be like the father according to the Apostle &amp; a conclusion <a id="l277"></a>in which they approved the sense of the  said Creed of  Sirmium published before <a id="l279"></a>the Emperor. And their Legates in the end of the year <a id="l280"></a>subscribed this Creed of Sirmium &amp; so did the Council of <a id="l281"></a>Constantinople the next year A.C. 360 without any materi<a id="l282"></a>al  variation of words.</p>
<p id="par10">The principal reasons for abolishing the use of those <a id="l283"></a>words are thus set down by the Council of Seleucia in their <a id="l284"></a>preface to the Creed of Lucius: <em class="underline">Cum hæ voces</em> ομοούσιον <em class="underline">&amp;</em> <a id="l285"></a>ὁμοιούσιον <em class="underline">præteritis temporibus atque etiam nunc multos con<a id="l286"></a>turbarint; imò a quibusdam</em> ἀνόμοιον (<em class="underline">sive dissimilem patri filium) jam innovari dicatur</em>: ‘ομοούσιον (<em class="underline">sive dissimilem <a id="l287"></a>patri filium) jam innovari dicatur</em>: ὁμοούσιον <em class="underline">et</em> ὁμοι<a id="l288"></a>ούσιον <em class="underline">utpote voces a scripturis alienas rejicimus</em> ἀνόμοιον <a id="l289"></a><em class="underline">autem anathemate damnamus</em>. And thus by the Council <a id="l290"></a>of Sirmium at the end of their Creed: <em class="underline">Nomen autem</em> <a id="l291"></a>ὁυσίας <em class="underline">quod simplicius a Patribus positum, a populisque <a id="l292"></a>minime intellectum, offensionis causa sit; quod etiam <a id="l293"></a>in scripturis non contineatur, de medio tolli placuit</em>. <a id="l294"></a>And thus by Hilary out of an epistle of some western Bishop, read in the Council of Sirmium: <sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> <em class="underline">De homousio … tractantes <a id="l295"></a>primùm idcirco respuendum pronunciastis, quia</em> [per] <a id="l296"></a><em class="underline">verbi hujus enunciationem substantia prior intellige<a id="l297"></a>retur, quàm duo inter se partiti essent – Secundo quoque <a id="l298"></a>id addidistis quod patres nostri cum Paulus Samosatenus <a id="l299"></a>hæreticus pronunciatus est, etiam homousion repudia<a id="l300"></a>verint. …. Tertio etiam hæc causa improbandi homousij <a id="l301"></a>commemorata a vobis est, quia in Synodo quæ apud <a id="l302"></a>Nicæam fuit, coacti patres nostri propter eos qui  creaturam filium dicebant, nomen homousij indidissent; <a id="l304"></a>quod non recipiendum idcirco sit, quia nusquam scriptum <a id="l305"></a>reperietur</em>.</p>
<p id="par11">The word ὀυσία with its compounds was therefore laid <a id="l306"></a>aside for these reasons. ffirst because the word ὁμοούσιος <a id="l307"></a>in its proper signification (of which the Greeks were the best judges) <a id="l308"></a>imported a distinction or division of a prior substance <a id="l309"></a>into two or the coming of one substance out of another <a id="l310"></a>by emanation, emission, projection or partition as light <a id="l311"></a>comes from the Sun, a river from the fountain, a branch <a id="l312"></a>from the root, a piece from the whole, a child from the <a id="l313"></a>mother &amp;c. And in this sense the word implies that the <a id="l314"></a>son &amp; holy ghost sprang from the father after the <a id="l315"></a>manner of the Æons of the Gnosticks, or were parts <a id="l316"></a>of him as in the Trinity of Montanus: &amp; therefore <a id="l317"></a>it was not a proper word to be applied to the Trinity. For Basil tells us<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup>  that the Council of Antioch  in condemning Paul of Samosat rejected the Ὁμοούσιος for this very reason.</p>
<p id="par12">Secondly because the Council of Nice had admitted the <a id="l318"></a>word hastily &amp; against their inclination, the Emperor being <a id="l319"></a>present in the Council &amp;  pressing it, &amp; the Council <a id="l320"></a>making scruples, &amp; excepting against the signification above <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> mentioned which was the proper signification of the word <a id="l321"></a>&amp; cautioning that it should not be taken in that sense <a id="l322"></a>nor for any thing more then ὁμοιούσιος, &amp;  admitting <a id="l323"></a>it in this sense least the Emperor should be disgusted &amp; <a id="l324"></a>return to the heathen religion, &amp; the Bishops in all the <a id="l325"></a>East disputing afterwards against the use of the word <a id="l326"></a>&amp; contending that it was proper to bodies &amp; ὁμοιούσιος to <a id="l327"></a>spirits, &amp; omitting it in a bigger Council at Tyre &amp; <a id="l328"></a>in all their Councils which followed. For how uni<a id="l329"></a>versally the Greeks rejected this word may appear <a id="l330"></a>by the character which Hilary<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>  A.C 358 gave of the <a id="l331"></a>eastern Provinces where he was then in banishment. <a id="l332"></a><em class="underline">Tantum ecclesiarum orientalium periculum est</em>, saith he, <a id="l333"></a><em class="underline">ut rarum sit hujus fidei</em> [consubstantialis,] <em class="underline">quæ qualis <a id="l334"></a>sit vos judicate, aut sacerdotes aut populum inveniri</em>. <a id="l335"></a>— <em class="underline">Nam absque episcopo Eleusio et paucis cum eo, <a id="l336"></a>ex majori parte Asianæ decem provinciæ vere <a id="l337"></a>deum nesciunt</em>.</p>
<p id="par13">Thirdly, because the Latines &amp; their friends among <a id="l338"></a>the Greeks had interpreted the word ὁμοούσιος by μιας <a id="l339"></a>ὀυσίας &amp; μιας ὑποστασ unius substantiæ, &amp; thereby <a id="l340"></a>departed from the sense of the Nicene Council which had <a id="l341"></a>interpreted that word by ὁμοιούσιος similis substantiæ, <a id="l342"></a>as appeared by the Acts of that Council produced in the Council of Ariminum for convincing the Latines. And <a id="l343"></a>there having arisen great disturbances between the Greeks <a id="l344"></a>&amp; Latines about the language of similis substantiæ &amp; <a id="l345"></a>unius substantiæ, the best way to put an end to those <a id="l346"></a>disturbances was to abolish the use of the words which <a id="l347"></a>had caused them.</p>
<p id="par14">ffourthly, the words homousios,  ex sub<a id="l348"></a>stantia, &amp; unius substantiæ were very ambiguous &amp; apt to be misunderstood &amp; taken together, very much <a id="l349"></a>favoured the errors of the Gnosticks Cataphrygians &amp; <a id="l350"></a>Sabellians &amp; caused them to spread in the west. For Hilary <a id="l351"></a>in his banishment wrote thus to the  Bishops of Gallia <a id="l352"></a>&amp; Britian. <em class="underline">Multi ex nobis, fratres charissimi,  ita unam <a id="l353"></a>substantiam Patris et Filij prædicant, ut videri possint non <a id="l354"></a>magis id pie quam impie prædicare: habet enim hoc <a id="l355"></a>verbum in se et fidei conscientiam et fraudem paratam <a id="l356"></a>Nam si secundum naturæ proprietatem ac similitudinem <a id="l357"></a>ut similitudo non speciem suam auferat, sed genus teneat, <a id="l358"></a>religiose unam substantiam prædicaums, dummodo unam <a id="l359"></a>substantiam proprietatis similitudinem intelligamus, ut <a id="l360"></a>quod unum sunt non singularem significet sed æquales: <a id="l361"></a>æqualitatem dico, id est, indifferentiam similitudinis, <a id="l362"></a>ut similitudo habeatur æqualitas. Æqualitas verò unum <a id="l363"></a>idcirco dicitur esse quia par sit. Vnum autem in quo <a id="l364"></a>par significatur, non ad unicum vendicetur. Una igitur <a id="l365"></a>substantia si non personam subsistentem perimat, nec unam</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">substantiam partitam in duas dividat, religiose præ<a id="l366"></a>dicabitur: Quæ ex nativitatis proprietate &amp; ex naturæ <a id="l367"></a>similitudine ita indifferens sit, ut una dicatur. At verò <a id="l368"></a>si idcirco unius substantiæ pater et filius dicatur ut hic <a id="l369"></a>subsistens, sub significatione licet duûm nominum unus <a id="l370"></a>ac solus sit: confessum nomine filium conscientia <a id="l371"></a>non tenemus, si unam substantiam</em> [cum Sabellio] <a id="l372"></a><em class="underline">confitentes ipsum sibi unicum ac singularem &amp; <a id="l373"></a>patrem esse dicimums et filium. Quinetiam et <a id="l374"></a>hujus tanti erroris occurrit occasio, ut divisus a se <a id="l375"></a>ipse pater intelligatur, &amp; partem execuisse quæ <a id="l376"></a>esset sibi filius. Id enim hæretici</em> [Cataphryges sc.] <a id="l377"></a><em class="underline">unam substantiam prædicantes contendunt. Et his <a id="l378"></a>multum piæ confessionis nostræ sermo blanditur; ut <a id="l379"></a>dum hoc verbum indefinita brevitate dubium est, pro<a id="l380"></a>ficiat ad errorem. Est præterea error hic tertius <a id="l381"></a>ut cum unius substantiæ pater et filius</em>  <em class="underline">esse dicuntur, significari existimetur substan<a id="l383"></a>tia prior, quam inter se duo pares</em> [juxta Theologiam <a id="l384"></a>Gnosticorum] <em class="underline">haberent: ac si tres res sermo significet, <a id="l385"></a>substantiam unam, et duos unius substantiæ velut <a id="l386"></a>cohæredes</em>. Here Hilary gives four significations of <em class="underline">unius</em> <a id="l387"></a>substantiæ three of which were heretical, &amp; tells his bre<a id="l388"></a>thren the western Bishops that many of them taught it <a id="l389"></a>in the heretical senses, &amp;  instructs them in <a id="l390"></a>the  fourth signification, namely that the union was only specific or that the father &amp; son <a id="l391"></a> were  two equal substances in number <a id="l392"></a>&amp; one in nature &amp; species. It was not therefore without <a id="l393"></a>some reason that when Hilary came to the Council <a id="l394"></a>of Seleucia the Oriental Bishops examined him, <em class="underline">ac <a id="l395"></a>primum quæsitum ab eo</em>, saith  Sulpicius, <em class="underline">quæ esset <a id="l396"></a>Gallorum fides: qui tum, Arianis prava de nobis vul<a id="l397"></a>gantibus, suspecti ab orientalibus habebamur trio<a id="l398"></a>nymam solitarij Dei unionem secundum Sabellium <a id="l399"></a>credidisse. Sed exposita fide sua</em> [de unitate specifica] <em class="underline">juxta ea quæ Nicææ <a id="l400"></a>erant a patribus conscripta, Occidentalibus perhi<a id="l401"></a>buit testimonium</em>. The language of homousios,  &amp; unius substantiæ  being therefore a stumbling block to <a id="l403"></a>Christians &amp; leading them to dangerous heresies &amp; the worship of fals Gods, <a id="l404"></a>was for that reason abolished by the Greeks.</p>
<p id="par15">ffiftly, this language was first used by hereticks such <a id="l405"></a><sup>✝</sup> as were the Cataphrygians &amp; Sabellians.  It was their language &amp; was condemned by the ancient Church, &amp; gave occasion to the Arian  controversy. For when Abimander bishop of Alexandria <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup>  maintained an essential unity of the father &amp; son, Arius took it for the una substantia of Sabellius &amp; thereupon set himself to oppose it. Vna substantia was also the language of the Montanists, &amp; so was ὁμοούσιος. And this last word was condemned in Paul of Samosat <a id="l407"></a> by a Council of 80 eastern bishops or above volun<a id="l408"></a>tarily convened at Antioch about 60 years before the Coun<a id="l409"></a>cil of Nice, &amp; the sentence against Paul <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup>  was communicated <a id="l410"></a>to all the Churches of the Roman Empire for their appro<a id="l411"></a>bation &amp; approved by them without any controversy arising <a id="l412"></a>upon it. And Paul was ejected by the consent of the Bishops <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> of Rome &amp; Italy under their hands in writing, so that the <a id="l413"></a>sentence against him was the sentence of the Church <a id="l414"></a>catholick.  And for this &amp; other reasons the Council of Nice scrupled the homousion, <a id="l415"></a>admitted it only at the importunity of the Emperor &amp; limited its <a id="l416"></a>signification; &amp; as soon as the fathers of that Council were <a id="l417"></a>at liberty, they disputed against it vehemently &amp; dropt it <a id="l418"></a>in all their following Councils &amp; never desisted till they got it re<a id="l419"></a>pealed. If numbers of bishops are to be considered the <a id="l420"></a>Council of Ariminum was bigger then the Nicene: if <a id="l421"></a>antiquity freedom &amp; universal approbation, the Council <a id="l422"></a>of Antioch must take place. But Hilary is of another <a id="l423"></a>opinion. <em class="underline">Male intelligitur homousion</em> saith he; <em class="underline">quid ad me bene intelli<a id="l424"></a>gentem? Male homousion Samosatenus confessus est, sed <a id="l425"></a>nunquid melius Ariani negaverunt? Octaginta Episcopi olim <a id="l426"></a>respuerunt, sed trecenti decem et octo nuper receperunt.</em> <a id="l427"></a>Thus Hilary argues for repealing the sentence of the primitive Church <a id="l428"></a> against Paul, as if the best way of opposing Arius <a id="l429"></a>was to  receive the language of the old hereticks, <a id="l430"></a>&amp; as if the Greeks did not enough in condemning the language <a id="l431"></a>of Arius unless they receded from the decrees of their ancestors &amp; received the language of Paul &amp; <a id="l432"></a>Montanus &amp; the Sabellians &amp; Manichees &amp; ancient Gnosticks. For the Greeks condemned the language of Arius in almost all their Councils.</p>
<p id="par16">A sixt reason alledged for omitting the word ὁμοούσιος <a id="l433"></a>was that the Nicene fathers had  admitted it out of <a id="l434"></a>simplicity (or without due examination) &amp; by com<a id="l435"></a>pulsion. For Constantine the great soon after his victory <a id="l436"></a>over Licinius A.C. 324 hearing of the controversy between Alexander &amp;  Arius &amp; sending to them by Hosius a <a id="l437"></a>letter to forebear disturbing the Empire by their <a id="l438"></a>trifling disputes &amp; Arius not submitting but repre<a id="l439"></a>senting that he had the multitude &amp; particularly all <a id="l440"></a>Libya: the Emperor set against him vehemently &amp; <a id="l441"></a>resolved to suppress this multitude &amp; for that end <a id="l442"></a>composed against them a florid epistle directed to <a id="l443"></a>Arius &amp; the Arians &amp; caused it to be published in <a id="l444"></a>every city throughout the whole Empire &amp; then <a id="l445"></a>called the Council of Nice. This letter was to silence <a id="l446"></a>the multitude in all places till the Council could meet. <a id="l447"></a>It began thus. <em class="underline">Malus interpres negotium est diaboli <a id="l448"></a>ejusque effigies ac imago</em>. And in the body of the Epistle <a id="l449"></a>the Emperor repeating the words of Arius, <em class="underline">Multitudinem <a id="l450"></a>habemus</em>, replies, <em class="underline">Ipse igitur exiguus propius accedam</em> <a id="l451"></a> <em class="underline">ut <a id="l452"></a>insanorum bellorum spectator sim.

Thereupon Iulius Bishop of Rome summoned a Council of about 50 Bishops of Italy &amp; the parts adjoyning to meet at Rome  Whereupon Iulius called a Council of 50 or 60 Western Bishops to meet <a id="l806"></a>at Rome A.C. 342 &amp;  cited the eastern Bishops then met in the said Council of  Antioch to appeare before this Council to give an account of their proceedings against <a id="l808"></a>Athanasius &amp; the rest who had appealed to him. And this was the <a id="l809"></a>beginning of the open pretensions of the Bishop of Rome to the <a id="l810"></a>universal Bishopric.

<p id="par60">About three years after these things the Emperor Constans at the request <a id="l989"></a>of Athanasius &amp; Marcellus obteined of his brother Constantius <a id="l990"></a>that a general Council should be called at Serdica a city <a id="l991"></a>in the confine of the two Empires.

<p id="par64">About four years after, when by spreading a clamour against the eastern bishops as if <a id="l1009"></a> they were Arians, his party was sufficiently increased, the Emperors by the working of  the Bishops <a id="l1010"></a>  were induced to call a general Council to meet the next year A.C. 347 at Serdica a city in the confine of <a id="l1011"></a>both Empires to examin the matter but first to treat of the faith. And there came thither  &amp; there came thither  about 80 eastern &amp; <a id="l1012"></a>a much greater number of Western &amp; Egyptian Bishops. But before they met.</p> 
<p id="par65" class="i0">And in this state things continued till  the year 353 in which <a id="l1013"></a>Constantius conquered Magnentius the successor of Constans &amp; becoming Lord <a id="l1014"></a>of the whole Roman Empire checkt the ambition of the Church of Rome, <a id="l1015"></a>&amp; in this interval of time a new Creed was handed about in the name of the Council <a id="l1016"></a>of Serdica. ffor some  proposed  &amp; endeavoured in that Council that a new profession of faith <a id="l1017"></a>should be published for supplying what was wanting to the Nicene  profession &amp; endeavoured to compass it &amp; others <a id="l1018"></a>were unwilling that the Nicene should be thought deficient. They  that <a id="l1019"></a>were for a new  Creed no doubt offered one agreeable to the  sentiments of the <a id="l1020"></a>Council &amp; this I conceive to be  the Creed which afterwards was handed about in their <a id="l1021"></a>name.

It wants the <a id="l1036"></a>descent into hell &amp; the communion of saints &amp; therefore was  composed before those articles <a id="l1037"></a>came into the Creed of the Latines.

This Profession of <a id="l1225"></a>faith Hilary approves &amp; commends as  made in short but most absolute definitions  And <a id="l1226"></a>hitherto the Churches  of the Greeks &amp; Latines had continued  united in external <a id="l1227"></a>communion throughout the whole Roman Empire  but now they <a id="l1228"></a>began to separate the Latines being offended that the Greeks called the father son &amp; holy Ghost three hypostases, &amp; omitted the word ὁμοούσιος <a id="l1229"></a>in their Creeds  &amp; the  Greeks that the Latines translated it unius <a id="l1230"></a> hypostasis, absolved persons excomunicated by the Greek Church &amp; endeavoured to sub<a id="l1231"></a>ject  that  Church  to the authority of the Bishop of Rome. &amp; both parties that five or six of the principal Bishops of their party were excommunicated by those of the other party.</p>
<p id="par75">Six years after these things were done Constantius conquered Magnentius <a id="l1232"></a>the successor of his brother Constans  in the western Empire &amp; <a id="l1233"></a> two years after  called a Council of  above 300 Bishops at  Millain,  [besides two Councils at Arles &amp; Biterræ in Gallia &amp; a third at Aquileia] to subscribe the condemnation of Athanasius <a id="l1235"></a>They offered to subscribe if the Nicene faith might be first  confirmed <a id="l1236"></a>but were told that   nothing could  proceed till they quitted the communion of persons excommunicated, for which end they were called together.  Whereupon they all subscribed except  Paulinus Trevirensis  Eusebius Vercellensis <a id="l1239"></a>Lucifer Calaritanus,  Dionysius Mediolanensis  &amp; Rhodanus who were therefore <a id="l1240"></a>banished as was also Liberius bishop of Rome &amp; Hosius a litte after &amp; Hilary <a id="l1241"></a>&amp; Dosanus a year after.  And  all these  offered  to subscribe if <a id="l1242"></a>the Nicene faith  were confirmed first, &amp; thereby they allowed that they  could <a id="l1243"></a> subscribe with a good conscience. There were also  Councils called  at <a id="l1246"></a>Arles &amp; Biterrs in Gallia &amp;  at Aquileia, &amp; Messengers sent <a id="l1247"></a>with publick notaries to take the subscriptions of the rest of the Bishops who staid at home.  Hosius also &amp; Liberius after they had <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022r"> &lt;22r&gt; </span> been a year or two in banishment subscribed. And thus the supremacy <a id="l1249"></a>of the Bishop of Rome set up by the Councils of Rome &amp; Serdica  <a id="l1250"></a>over the eastern churches fell, the Bishop of Rome himself with <a id="l1251"></a>all the western Bishops except seven or eight &amp; all their Presbyters except a very few,  subscribing &amp; thereby <a id="l1252"></a>acknowledging the supreme &amp; absolute judicial  authority of the  Councils of the  Greek Church over <a id="l1254"></a> her own members. But  over the Latine Churches of the consubstantial faith in Europe the supremacy <a id="l1255"></a>of the Bishop of Rome still remained being no ways opposed by Constantius <a id="l1256"></a>or the Greek Church. And thence it came to pass  that when the western <a id="l1257"></a>Empire  was invaded by several barbarous nations, those <a id="l1258"></a>nations (particularly the Franks in Gallia the Goths in Spain &amp; the Lombards in Italy), as fast as they  became converted to the Consubstantial faith, <a id="l1259"></a> subjected their Churches to the authority of the Bishop of Rome; &amp; that <a id="l1260"></a>Socrates who wrote A.C. 429 said then that the Bishops of Rome &amp; Alexandria <a id="l1261"></a>had of old exceeded the bounds of Priesthood &amp; degenerated into domination <a id="l1262"></a>(Socr. l. 7. c. 11) &amp; that Ammianus in describing the very bloody contest <a id="l1263"></a>between  Damasus &amp; Vrsisinus for the bishopric of Rome A.C. 367, saith</p><span class="pagenumber" id="p022v"> &lt;22v&gt; </span>
<p id="par76" class="i0">but were  made to understand that <a id="l1264"></a>the communicating with persons excommunicated was  contrary to the <a id="l1265"></a>rules of the church &amp; of a criminal nature, that nothing could proceede till <a id="l1266"></a>they quitted such communion, &amp; returned into communion with the Churches who had excommunicated them, that the Emperor called them together for <a id="l1267"></a>that purpose &amp;  they were not to go upon other things without his <a id="l1268"></a>leave, &amp; that those who persisted in such communion must expect to be <a id="l1269"></a>banished as criminals.</p>
<p id="par77" class="i0">but were made to understand that nothing could be debated or proceed in Council till they <a id="l1270"></a>quitted the communion of persons excommunicated &amp; returned into commu<a id="l1271"></a>nion with the bishops with whom they were to debate, that the Emperor <a id="l1272"></a>called them together for that purpose &amp; they could not go upon other <a id="l1273"></a>things  till they had his leave, that the wilful communicating with persons  who stood excommunicated by others was <a id="l1275"></a>contrary to the rules of the church &amp; of a criminal nature &amp; that <a id="l1276"></a>those who persisted in such communion excommunicated themselves &amp; must  expect  for restoring the peace of the Church disturbed by them to be <a id="l1277"></a>banished as criminals.</p>
