The inner court was bounded by a marble rail &amp; in the center <a id="l4"></a>thereof stood the great <a id="l5"></a>altar.

The whole, made an area 200 cubits <a id="l12"></a>broad from south to north &amp; 250 long, &amp; was compassed with the outward <a id="l13"></a>court or court of the people which was 100 cubits broad on every side <a id="l14"></a>&amp; this court was compassed on the west with a wall &amp; on the other <sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> three sides with a pavement 50 cubits broad upon which stood the <a id="l15"></a>buildings where the sacrifices were baked &amp; boyled &amp; eaten by the <a id="l16"></a>people. All this made an area 500 cubits long &amp; 500 broad &amp; was <a id="l17"></a>compassed with a court or walk called the mountain of the house <a id="l18"></a>&amp; this court was compassed with a wall six cubits broad &amp; six high <a id="l19"></a>&amp; 600 long on every side. And the cubit was about  22 English <a id="l20"></a>inches in length or  six eleventh parts of a pendulum vibrating second, <a id="l21"></a>being an hand breadth bigger then the vulgar cubit.  Thus the Altar <a id="l22"></a>stood in the center of the whole.</p>
<p id="par2">In the buildings of both courts over against the middle of the <a id="l23"></a>Altar  eastward northward &amp; southward were Gates 25 cubits <a id="l24"></a>broad between the buildings &amp; 50 long cross the pavements.  Every gate <a id="l25"></a>had  two thresholds  six cubits broad &amp; 10 <a id="l26"></a>long the doors of the Gates being 10 cubits wide &amp; 20 high. &amp; between the thresholds was the distance of 28 cubits, which <a id="l27"></a>made the  length of the gate 40 cubits besides the Porch <a id="l28"></a>which was 10 cubits more. The Porch &amp; the space between the thresholds was 13 <a id="l29"></a>cubits  wide &amp; on either side of the space were  three Posts or Pillars each six <a id="l30"></a>cubits square &amp; twenty high with arches five cubits wide between the Posts all which made up the 28 cubits. These <a id="l31"></a>arches led into  cloisters  under a double building on either side  of every Gate, supported by <a id="l32"></a>three rows of marble pillars butting upon the middle of the <a id="l33"></a>square Posts so that  there were two walks  in the cloysters each 11 cubits broad <a id="l34"></a>between the axes  of the pillars. The Gates &amp; buildings of both <a id="l35"></a>courts were alike &amp; faced one another, the Porches of the Gates &amp; the <a id="l36"></a>cloysters of the buildings looking towards the peoples court. The pillars <a id="l37"></a>on the backside of the cloysters adhered to marble walls which bounded the <a id="l38"></a>cloysters &amp; supported the buildings. All the buildings of the Temple <a id="l39"></a>were three stories high, &amp; were supported in the two stories above the cloysters  by a row of cedar beams or pillars standing  above the middle row of the <a id="l41"></a>marble pillars. These buildings On either side of every Gate of the peoples court <a id="l42"></a> conteined 5 exhedræ or large chambers on a floor running in length from the Gates towards the corners of the court, in all sixty chambers,  where the <a id="l43"></a>people ate the sacrifices, &amp; at the ends of these buildings in the four corners of this peoples court were  little <a id="l44"></a>courts 40 cubits square for stair cases to the buildings  for &amp; kitchens to boile &amp; bake the <a id="l45"></a>sacrifices.  the kitchin being 30 cubits broad &amp; the staircase 10. They went up from the mountain of the house to the Gates <a id="l46"></a>of the peoples court by seven steps &amp; from the peoples court to the <a id="l47"></a>Gates of the Priests court by eight steps &amp; on either side of the  Gates <a id="l48"></a>of the Priests Court were single Exhedræ  like the Exhedræ in the outward court but subdivided into <a id="l49"></a>smaller rooms for the great officers of the Temple &amp; Princes of the Priests.</p>

[ If they entered into that covenant as necessary to salvation they <a id="l285"></a>made void the faith in Christ.

The [] the beleiving Gentiles were discipuled to God &amp; Christ &amp; the beleiving Iews the Holy Ghost  to Christ &amp; <a id="l288"></a>their Baptism was according in the name of all three or in the name of Christ alone. The Iews had two sorts of Baptism, the one of  cleansing the <a id="l289"></a>other of Proselytes.  The <a id="l292"></a>baptism of Proselytes was administred only to proselytes that of cleansing to proselytes &amp; their  <a id="l293"></a>posterity.

<p id="par24">The beleiving Iews observed the law not as necessary to salvation but because  the law was good <a id="l294"></a>&amp; they had entered into a covenant to observe it. Their children might enter into the same covenant as Timothy did, but perhaps  were not obliged to enter into it the beleiving Gentiles were not  to enter <a id="l295"></a>into it  but only to keep the precepts of the sons of Noah. And if they entred into  it <a id="l296"></a> as necessary to salvation they made void their faith in Christ. Two of those precepts were to abstein from  blood &amp; from things strangled: for blood inclines to cruelty and strangling is a painfull death The  Iews admitted <a id="l297"></a>their Proselytes by  circumcision &amp; baptism, the Christians only by baptism.  The children of <a id="l298"></a>proselytes were born within the Church  under the law were circumcised like the children of the Iews <a id="l299"></a>but not baptised with the baptism of proselytes, nor were they cleansed from original sin by many baptisms. For Original sin is like the sin of the second commandment <a id="l300"></a>God visits it upon the children unto many generations in this life tho the children  <a id="l301"></a>have not actually sinned but in the next life will punish only  the actual sinners. And therefore  to wash away the sin by baptism is to free men from the ill conse<a id="l302"></a>quences of it in this world one of which is death. Yet  might the baptism of children by the  signe of a covenant <a id="l303"></a>among Christians as circumcision was among the Iews. The Iews were proselyted only to Christ <a id="l304"></a>the Gentiles to God &amp; Christ &amp; the Holy  Spirit &amp; therefore the Iews were  baptised only in the <a id="l305"></a>name of Christ, the Gentiles in the name of all three, &amp; the first Christians had one &amp; the same <a id="l306"></a>God &amp; one &amp; the same Holy  spirit with the ancient Church of the Iews, &amp; the Christian religion <a id="l307"></a>before the calling of the Gentiles added nothing more to the Iewish then  the beleife that Iesus was <a id="l308"></a>the Messiah or Christ predicted by Daniel &amp; to worship him as the Messiah or Lord &amp; King   Mediator between God &amp; Man. God was to be worshipped as God Almighty &amp; the Lord Iesus as the Christ    or Lord. For to us there <a id="l310"></a>is but one God the Father of whom are all things &amp; we of him &amp; one Lord Iesus by whom are all thing <a id="l311"></a>&amp; we are by him.</p>

<p id="par25">The converted Iews were all zealous of the law &amp; were obliged to keep it, not <a id="l312"></a>as necessary to salvation but by reason of the covenant which they had made with God by <a id="l313"></a>circumcission. But the Gentiles were not obliged to enter into this covenant. And when <a id="l314"></a>some Iews contended that unless they were circumcised they could not be saved, the <a id="l315"></a>Apostles &amp; Elders of the Church at Ierusalem  came together to consider this matter <a id="l316"></a>&amp; concluded that they should not trouble those who were converted from among the Gentiles with <a id="l317"></a>any thing further then to abstein from pollutions of idols &amp; from fornication &amp; from things strang<a id="l318"></a>led &amp; from blood. For the eating of blood inclines to cruelty &amp; strangling is a painfull death. <a id="l319"></a>All this respected only the converted Gentiles. For Paul himself who  chiefly opposed <a id="l320"></a>the circumcision of the Gentiles observed the law &amp; circumcised Timothy because  <a id="l321"></a>his mother was a Iewess, but could not be induced to circumcise Titus a Greek, &amp; argues in <a id="l322"></a>his Epistles not against  keeping the covenant of circumcision but against entering into it <a id="l323"></a>as necessary to salvation. For he represents that the law is good &amp; Proselytes who <a id="l324"></a>are circumcised are bound to observe it, but if they be circumcised upon a <a id="l325"></a>beleif that they cannot otherwise be saved Christ profits them nothing. And <a id="l326"></a> And the last time that Paul was at Ierusalem (which was about 10 years before the destruction of that city the Elders  told him that all the <a id="l328"></a>converted Iews (which were many in thousands) were zealous of the law &amp;  were informed that  he taught the Iews which <a id="l329"></a>were among the Gentiles to forsake the law, &amp;  therefore advised him to purify himself with some other beleiving  Iews <a id="l330"></a>who had a row, that all might know the falsness of the information &amp; that he himself kept the law <a id="l331"></a> But as touching the Gentiles which beleive we have written, say the Elders, &amp; concluded that they <a id="l332"></a>observe no such thing save only that they keep themselves from things offered to Idols &amp; from <a id="l333"></a>blood &amp; from things strangled &amp; from fornication. The Iews were therefore bound to observe the <a id="l334"></a>law notwithstanding their conversion but  their children being circumcised before they were <a id="l335"></a>at years of discretion might be at liberty</p>

And <a id="l1271"></a>the breadth from west to east between the Porch of the Temple  &amp; the eastern Portico <a id="l1272"></a> of  this Court was 78 cubits. For I found this court with the front of the Porch <a id="l1273"></a>because the Porch in Herods Temple was 100 cubits broad &amp; an hundred high. The Court <a id="l1274"></a>of the weomen which was a long square 135 cubits in length &amp; about 88 in breadth within <a id="l1275"></a>the walls,  had seats like galleries round about within on the south, east &amp; north sides for the <a id="l1276"></a>people to sit dry, the weomen above &amp; the men below.

The men had further access <a id="l1290"></a>into the  eastern margin of the Priests court as far as the  stone rail of <a id="l1291"></a>a cubit, &amp; that margin was thence called the Court of Israel.  When Zerub<a id="l1292"></a>babel laid the foundation of this  Temple the littleness of the <a id="l1293"></a>weomens court made the old men weep who had seen the great Court <a id="l1294"></a>of the people in Solomon's Temple, in the room of which this little court succeeded.</p>
<p id="par80"> After the Temple had continued in this state during the <a id="l1295"></a>reign of the Persians.  Simeon Iustus built the great Court, having for <a id="l1296"></a>a pattern the eastern  side which was left standing, being called Solomons <a id="l1297"></a>Porch or Portico because built by Solomon as  we are told by <a id="l1298"></a>Iosephus who had seen it.  And afterwards Herod rebuilt the southern <a id="l1299"></a>side more sumptuously with four  rows of Pillars. But the Gentiles were stil admitted <a id="l1300"></a>into this Court as far as the wall Soreg &amp; therefore it was called the <a id="l1301"></a>Court of the Gentiles:  And the Priests &amp; people still con<a id="l1302"></a>tinued their worship in the sanctuary &amp; weomens court built by <a id="l1303"></a>Zerubbabel  &amp; rebuilt by Herod.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span>
<p id="par81">– And here ends the sacred history of the Iews.</p>
<p id="par82">The second Temple being built under the dominion of the Persians <a id="l1304"></a>it may not be amiss here to give a short description of it. This was <a id="l1305"></a>built upon the same foundations with the Inner Temple   <a id="l1306"></a> of Solomon. It was three hundred <a id="l1307"></a>cubits long &amp; two hundred broad including the buildings. It had two courts <a id="l1308"></a>called the separate place &amp; the Priests court each 100 cubits square <a id="l1309"></a> besides the Court of the weomen which answered to the new court in <a id="l1310"></a>Solomons Temple. On the  separate place stood the house of God as <a id="l1311"></a>in Solomons Temple. But here it was only two storys high. On the <a id="l1312"></a>north &amp; south sides of the Separate place stood the buildings in <a id="l1313"></a>which the Priests did eat the sacrifices &amp; lay up their holy garments <a id="l1314"></a>They were cloystered on the inside towards the house. On the north <a id="l1315"></a>&amp; south sides of the Priests court stood the buildings for the Princes of <a id="l1316"></a>the Priests &amp; these were cloystered not on the out side as in Solomons <a id="l1317"></a>Temple but on the inside towards the Altar which stood in the center <a id="l1318"></a>of the Priests court. These buildings had walks before them &amp; stood <a id="l1319"></a>upon  an area 50 cubits broad on either side of the separate Place <a id="l1320"></a>&amp; Priests court, the whole  together with those Courts, taking up  a square area <a id="l1321"></a>two hundred Cubits long &amp; two hundred broad including the walks. On the eastern side of <a id="l1322"></a>the  Priests court was the court of the people called the weomens <a id="l1323"></a>Court because the weomen were admitted into it as well as the men. <a id="l1324"></a>The separate place was distinguished from the Priests court by a <a id="l1325"></a>rail of marble, &amp; the Priests court from the court of the weomen <a id="l1326"></a>by a building for the High Priest &amp; the Sanhedrim. The whole <a id="l1327"></a>was compassed on the outside by a walk ten cubits broad &amp; <a id="l1328"></a>the walk by a strong wall. This wall was lower on the eastern <a id="l1329"></a>side then on the other three sides so that they might from the <a id="l1330"></a>Priests court see the burning of the red cow over it, &amp; I take <a id="l1331"></a>it to be the double height the high fortress of the wall about <a id="l1332"></a>the Temple built from the foundations by Simeon the just. Ecclesi<a id="l1333"></a>ast. 50. 2. From this walk they went down on the outside by steps to <a id="l1334"></a>the rail Chajil which compassed the whole. The Gentiles had access <a id="l1335"></a>into outward court of Solomons Temple as far as to the rail Chajil <a id="l1336"></a>the Israelites both men &amp; weomen had access into the weomens court, <a id="l1337"></a>the men had further access as far as to the eastern rail of the <a id="l1338"></a>Priests court, the Priests had access into their own court with the build<a id="l1339"></a>ings &amp; into the Holy place to worship God morning &amp; evening &amp; the High Priest into the <a id="l1340"></a>most holy place once a year. And to the building of this Temple <a id="l1341"></a>neare the beginning of the Babylonia captivity, the  Angel seems <a id="l1342"></a>to allude in the Apocalypse where he saith Arise, measure the Temple of God &amp; the Altar &amp; <a id="l1343"></a>them that  worship therein, (that is the Court of the Temple or separate place &amp; the <a id="l1344"></a>court of the Altar  or Priests court &amp; the court of the <a id="l1345"></a>people or  new court : ) but the court which is without the Temple <a id="l1346"></a>(the outward court of Solomons Temple) leave out &amp; measure it <a id="l1347"></a>not: for it is given to the  Gentiles of Babylon,) &amp; the holy <a id="l1348"></a>city shall they tread under foot forty &amp; two months.</p>
<p id="par83">On the eastern side of the  outward court upon three rows of marble Pillars stood the building called <a id="l1349"></a>Solomons Porch. It seems to have been  a part of Solomons Temple left <a id="l1350"></a>standing by Nebuchadnezzar. On the north side of the outward court was <a id="l1351"></a>built a fortress in the days of the Maccabees. Herod rebuilt it &amp; called it <a id="l1352"></a>Antonia in honour of Marc Antony. Herod built also the southern side of <a id="l1353"></a>the outward court more sumptuously then Solomon had done, setting it upon four <a id="l1354"></a>rows of Marble pillars. And the Porch of the House he built an hundred cubits broad <a id="l1355"></a>which was seventy cubits broader then in Solomons Temple.</p></div>
