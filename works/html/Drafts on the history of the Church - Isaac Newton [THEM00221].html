<p id="par2">Now the strong meats which are proper for men ought  not to be mixed <a id="l1"></a>with the milk which is to be given to babes. The Church has no authority <a id="l2"></a>to alter the foundation upon which she  was built by Christ &amp; his Apostles <a id="l3"></a> All the articles of <a id="l4"></a> faith  necessary to baptism were put into the Creed by the Apostles <a id="l5"></a>&amp; nothing unnecessary nothing disreputable or mystical was to be added afterwards. Men may vary the <a id="l6"></a>language in which the articles of the Creed are expressed (keeping to authentic forms of words) but must not vary <a id="l7"></a>the sense. They have no authority to increase diminish or alter the faith <a id="l8"></a>into which baptism was instituted  by Christ: for the servant is <a id="l9"></a>not above his Master.  By being baptized into this faith the <a id="l10"></a>Christians of all nations were united in the beginning into one Church Catholic &amp; one <a id="l11"></a>mystical body of Christ , &amp; to alter this  faith is to loosen the bond <a id="l12"></a>of the union &amp; endanger the dissolution of the whole. To impose any new <a id="l13"></a>condition of communion which all Christians cannot admit is to deny com<a id="l14"></a>munion to those who by the institution of Christ have a right to it. To <a id="l15"></a>alter the symbol of the Christian religion by the recital of which the Chris<a id="l16"></a>tians of all nations knew one another to be Christians is to make it difficult <a id="l17"></a>for Christians to know one another. Hereticks have their Creeds &amp; Christians <a id="l18"></a>which differ in their Creeds may be apt to take one another for hereticks. And therefore all alterations of the Creed tend to discord schism &amp; dissolution of the Church  Men <a id="l19"></a>may be anathematized or excommunicated for blasphemy idolatry profaneness neglect of Gods worship or other impiety &amp; for faction  lying, deceiving, injustice uncleannes or other immorality &amp; for  impiety &amp; for immorality or  for denying or <a id="l20"></a>corrupting the faith into which they were baptized  or introducing any opinions which tend to ungodly or immoral practices But where they are <a id="l24"></a>ignorant of other truths not requisite to baptism  &amp; by consequence not requisite to salvation they are only to be, <a id="l25"></a>instructed &amp; admonished to study the scriptures &amp; informe themselves better. <a id="l26"></a>And such teachers are to be chosen in the Churches as are best able <a id="l27"></a>to instruct them. And  Articles or systemes of Christian faith &amp; <a id="l28"></a>knowledge may be drawn up to be taught next after the Creed &amp; <a id="l29"></a>subscribed by teachers. As for instance</p>
<p id="par3">1 That God the ffather is an infinite, eternal, omniscient, immortal &amp; invisible <a id="l30"></a>spirit whom no eye hath seen nor can see, &amp; all other spirits are sometimes  visible.</p>
<p id="par4">7 That Iesus   was beloved of God before the foundation of the world &amp; had glory with the father before <a id="l31"></a>the world began &amp; was the principle of the creation  of God, the Agent by whom God crea <a id="l32"></a><br>ted  this  world &amp; who is now gone to prepare another place or <a id="l33"></a>mansion for the blessed; for in Gods house there are many mansions,  &amp; God does nothing by himself which he can do by another.</p>
<p id="par5">8 That  Iesus is the  seed of the woman who should bruise the serpents <a id="l34"></a>head, the Shiloh predicted by Iacob, the Prophet predicted by  Moses, the Paschal Lamb, the <a id="l35"></a>son of David whose throne should be established for ever, the son of God <a id="l36"></a>mentioned in the Psalms, the son of Man predicted in Daniels prophesy of the <a id="l37"></a>four Beasts, the Messiah predicted in Daniels prophesy of the weeks,  the <a id="l38"></a> Prince of Princes predicted in Daniels <a id="l39"></a>prophesy of the Ram &amp;  He Goat,  the great Prince  Michael <a id="l40"></a>mentioned in the end of Daniel &amp; in the Apocalyps, &amp; the Word or Oracle of God whose <a id="l41"></a>testimony is the spirit of prophesy.</p>
<p id="par6"> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p067v"> &lt;67v&gt; </span> </p>


<p id="par9">12 That all men are sinners &amp; as we may forgive our enemies freely without <a id="l52"></a>injustice so God may forgive us freely without injustice. ffor we pray to him to <a id="l53"></a>forgive our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us. But if Christ <a id="l54"></a>had not merited a kingdom  no men could have been his subjects; &amp; therefore <a id="l55"></a>that any of us shall be rescued from the fate of other men &amp; translated  <a id="l56"></a>into his kingdom is due to his merits, &amp; this his meriting to chuse any of us <a id="l57"></a>to be his subjects is called appeasing &amp; satisfying Gods wrath &amp; making an <a id="l58"></a>attonement for us.</p>
<p id="par10">13. That all  pious &amp; vertuous &amp; good dispositions of the mind are from above as well as from our <a id="l59"></a>own endeavours, &amp; therefore they are called graces favours or gifts to put us <a id="l60"></a>in mind of praying for them &amp; of returning thanks for what we receive.</p>
<p id="par11">4. That  as we may give the name of kings to Viceroys but may not say that a king &amp; his Viceroy are two kings so we may give the name of Gods   to <a id="l62"></a>Angels &amp; mortal kings notwithstanding the 1<sup>st</sup> commandment but we  may not call  them Gods before  God almighty or in conjunction with him so as to say there are more Gods then one yet we <a id="l63"></a> neither may we worship Angels or Saints  as Gods in his presence or in conjunction with him by prayers, praises,  thanksgiving, or sacrifices <a id="l67"></a>for the blessings of this life  5 Nor may we invoke  Angels or the <a id="l68"></a>souls of dead men as Mediators between God &amp; Man  ffor  as there is but one God so there is but one Mediator between God <a id="l70"></a>&amp; man, the Man Christ Iesus.  For tho there be that are called <a id="l71"></a>Gods whether in heaven or in earth (as there be Gods many &amp; <a id="l72"></a>Lords many,) yet to us there is but one God, the father, of <a id="l73"></a>whom are all things &amp; we in him, &amp; one Lord Iesus Christ  by whom are all things &amp; we by him. There is, but one God whom we are to worship as our God the father almighty &amp; one Lord whom we are to worship as our Lord &amp; King &amp; Messiah the Prince. We are to  give <a id="l76"></a>glory &amp; honour &amp; thanks to God for cretaing all things &amp; for  our daily bread &amp; to the  Lamb of God  <a id="l77"></a>  for redeeming us with his blood, &amp; to direct <a id="l80"></a>our prayers to God  in the name of the  Lamb, but <a id="l81"></a>not to the Lamb in the name of  God.</p>
<p id="par12">6 That as the father hath life in himself &amp; hath given the son to <a id="l82"></a>have life in himself so the father hath knowledge &amp; wisdom &amp; power &amp; will &amp; counsel &amp; substance in himself &amp; <a id="l83"></a>hath given the son to have knowledge<sup>1</sup> &amp; wisdom<sup>2</sup> &amp; power<sup>5</sup> will<sup>4</sup> &amp; counsel<sup>3</sup> &amp; substance<sup>6</sup> in himself</p>
<p id="par13">10 That Ierusalem must be troden down of the Gentiles till the times <a id="l84"></a>of the Gentiles are fulfilled &amp; Israel must continue in blindness till the <a id="l85"></a> fulness of the Gentiles be come in, &amp; the heavens must contein <a id="l86"></a>Iesus till the times of refreshing &amp; restitution of all things shall come from <a id="l87"></a>the presence of the Lord. And then he shall come from heaven to judgment <a id="l88"></a>&amp; reign till God shall put all enemies under his feet. ffor being next to God <a id="l89"></a>in dignity and <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> he sits at the right hand of God  till <a id="l90"></a>God makes his enemies his footstool &amp; the last enemy to be subdued is death. <a id="l91"></a>And therefore he must reign till all the dead be raised &amp; judged &amp; the day of judgment <a id="l92"></a>be ended. ffor reigning &amp; judging are words of the same importance &amp; signi<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p068r"> &lt;68r&gt; </span>fication &amp; the day of judgment is the day of his kingdom. He must reign  <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> &amp; execute judgment in the kingdom of heaven And when <a id="l93"></a>death is subdued &amp; the day of judgment is ended then shalll he deliver <a id="l94"></a>the kingdom to his father  that God may be all in all &amp; shall return with the blessed into heaven to the <a id="l95"></a>place  which he is now gone to prepare for them that they <a id="l96"></a>may be with him &amp; behold the glory which God hath given him &amp; which he had with God before the world began.</p>
<p id="par14">11 That the dead shall rise again with bodies spirituall &amp; immortal <a id="l97"></a>but whether with all the body which they ever had, or with all which <a id="l98"></a>they had at their death, or with all which  constantly remained <a id="l99"></a>in them from the time of their conception to the time of their death <a id="l100"></a>or with any other part of their mortal bodies is a question as hard <a id="l101"></a>to determin as unnecessary to be known in order to salvation.</p>
<p id="par15">2 That the God who said in the 1<sup>st</sup> Commandment Thou shalt have no other Gods before me <a id="l102"></a>was the  God of the Iews who  made heaven &amp; earth in six days  as is said in the 4<sup>th</sup> Commandment &amp; whom we call God  almighty, signifying thereby that by his almighty power he <a id="l106"></a>made heaven &amp; earth &amp; is the first author or father of all things. ffor God almighty, God the first <a id="l107"></a>author, &amp; God the father are equipollent expressions,  &amp; therefore this <a id="l108"></a>God has no equalls. </p>

<p id="par17">3. That Idolatry is the worshipping of a fals God a God who is not what <a id="l110"></a>your worship supposes him to be, a  fictitious God, a Vanity. The <a id="l111"></a>praying to &amp; trusting in a God which cannot help or is not allowed to do it <a id="l112"></a>The  thanking &amp; praising a God for what he   did not or was not able to do, is idolizing a creature &amp; worshipping a false God. There <a id="l114"></a>is an obedience &amp; worship which is due to kings suitable to the power &amp; dominion which God has lodged <a id="l115"></a>in them.  There is a worship of  giving thanks &amp; <a id="l117"></a>praise &amp; honour &amp; glory to the Lamb for  being slain &amp; redeming <a id="l118"></a>us with his blood.  There is a worship which is due to Iesus <a id="l121"></a>as  our Lord &amp; King  the Messiah the Prince. ffor because he <a id="l122"></a> was obedient to death even the death of the cross <a id="l123"></a>therefore God hath highly exalted him &amp; set him at his own right <a id="l124"></a>hand far above all principality &amp; power &amp; might &amp; dominion &amp;  given him a name above every name not only in this world <a id="l126"></a>but also in that which is to come; that at the name of Iesus every knee <a id="l127"></a>should bow  of things in heaven &amp; in earth &amp; <a id="l128"></a>under the earth &amp; confess that Iesus Christ is Lord to the glory of <a id="l129"></a>God the ffather. There is a worship also which is due to God for creating <a id="l130"></a>all things by his almighty power &amp; giving us our daily bread. He <a id="l131"></a>is to be worshipped as the ffather almighty, the supreme potentate, the <a id="l132"></a>first author of all things, the Lord God omnipotent:  other  Potentates <a id="l133"></a>are to be worshipped according to the power &amp; dominion which he has <a id="l134"></a>given them over us &amp; the benefits which we receive fom them &amp; with <a id="l135"></a>such a worship only as he has granted them in order to his own glory <a id="l136"></a>ffor all things should be done in due order to the glory of God the father.</p>
<p id="par18">9 That the Christian religion was in its purity in the Apostles <a id="l137"></a>days &amp; after their death was to decay &amp; degenerate &amp; grow more &amp; more corrupt <a id="l138"></a>till the second coming of Christ. Paul told the of Ephesus that <a id="l139"></a>after his departure grievous wolfes should enter in among them not sparing <a id="l140"></a>the flock &amp; that of themselves men should arise speaking perverse things <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p068v"> &lt;68v&gt; </span> to draw away the disciples after them. Acts 20.29, 30.

And that this mystery of iniquity began to work in the Apostles days <a id="l148"></a> &amp; so soon as that which letted (the heathen Roman Empire which hindred the <a id="l149"></a>rise of this wicked Ecclesiastical dominion) should be taken out of the way that wicked <a id="l150"></a>one should be revealed &amp; should continue till the Lord should destroy him <a id="l151"></a>with the brightness of his second coming. 2 Thess. 2. For in the last days <a id="l152"></a>perillous times should come &amp; men (the professors of Christianity) should <a id="l153"></a>be lovers of themselves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemous, disobedient <a id="l154"></a>to parents, unthankfull, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers <a id="l155"></a>fals accusers, incontinent, fierce despisers of those  that are good <a id="l156"></a>traytors heady high minded lovers of pleasures more then lovers of <a id="l157"></a>God, having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof – – – ever <a id="l158"></a>learning &amp; never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, men of <a id="l159"></a>corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith. &amp; evil men shall wax worse &amp; worse deceiving &amp; being deceived 2 Tim. 3. For the time <a id="l160"></a>will come when the Churches will not endure sound doctrine but after their own <a id="l161"></a>lusts heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; &amp; they shall  turn <a id="l162"></a>away from the truth &amp; be turned unto fables. 2 Tim. 4.  And there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after <a id="l164"></a>their own lusts &amp; saying, Where is the promise of his coming? But the <a id="l165"></a>day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night. 2 Pet. 3. For the <a id="l166"></a>Apostles taught that Antichrist should come &amp; even before the death <a id="l167"></a>of Iohn the Apostle there were many Antichrists or enemies to the true Church of Christ <a id="l168"></a> who went out from it because they were not of it. And these being the <a id="l169"></a>forerunners of the great Antichrist whose reign is called the last time <a id="l170"></a>the Apostle  from these fore-runners that the last time was at <a id="l171"></a>hand &amp; so far as it respected the fore-runners of Antichrist was already <a id="l172"></a>begun.</p>
<p id="par19">14.

Moral Philosophy &amp; religion consist in practical opinions. And It is not enough that opinions be fals but <a id="l175"></a>they must be dangerous &amp; mischievous to deserve an anathema.</p>
<p id="par20">16. That men are admitted into the visible Church of Christ by baptism <a id="l176"></a>&amp; into the invisible by a true &amp; lively faith &amp; sincere &amp; effectual repentance from <a id="l177"></a>dead works.   The government of the <a id="l179"></a>visible Church of Christ may be taken away by  Antichrist, tis the <a id="l180"></a>invisible Church, the sincere mystical body of Christ against which the gates of hell (or magistracy of the wicked) <a id="l181"></a>shall not prevail.</p>
<p id="par21">15 When Iesus  commissioned his eleven disciples to   disciple all nations baptizing <a id="l182"></a>them in the name of the f. s. &amp; h. g.  &amp; teaching them to observe all things <a id="l183"></a>whatsoever he had commanded them &amp; promised  to be with them alway even to the <a id="l184"></a>end of the world: the commission &amp; promise were generall to ll who were or should become disciples.

<p id="par23">Now the mystery of iniquity which consisted in these heresies <a id="l194"></a>began to work in the days of the apostles &amp; apostolick men who had conversed <a id="l195"></a>with Christ, but by their authority was kept under. In the  <a id="l196"></a>days of  the next generation who had seen <a id="l200"></a>the Apostles it worked very much &amp; grew  populous <a id="l201"></a>but without making a breach upon the Church. In the third <a id="l202"></a>generation recconing about 70 years to a generation it <a id="l203"></a>made a breach in the Church. In the fourth it made a <a id="l204"></a>wider breach. In the fift it prevailed.</p>
<p id="par24"> The hereticks of the first age were   either Iews or Samaritans <a id="l205"></a>as Nicolaus, Simon, Cerinthus Menander. Those of the second were  Gnosticks  <a id="l206"></a> as Saturninus, Basilides, Carpocrates, Valentinus, Secundus, <a id="l207"></a>Ptolomæus,  Marcus, Colarbasus, <a id="l208"></a>Heracleon, Cerdon, Marcion, Apelles Tatian. Those of the third &amp; fourth age <a id="l209"></a>refining the heresies of the Gnosticks from the grosser absurdities <a id="l210"></a>which had been refuted  by the Christians of the  second age,  <a id="l211"></a>proposed heresies much more plausible &amp; dangerous then the <a id="l212"></a>former, as  Montanus, Tertullian, Noetus, Praxeas, Artemon, Paul <a id="l213"></a>of Samosat &amp; Sabellius.  In the first age there were also <a id="l214"></a>the  sects of the Nazarenes  &amp; Ebionites who being converted Iews were zealous of the law <a id="l215"></a> But these being circumcised &amp; thereby made debtors to the law  &amp;  <a id="l216"></a>  being of the Church of Iames who were all zealous of the <a id="l217"></a>law &amp; whose zeale was tolerated by the Apostles &amp; for whose use Matthew wrote his Gospel in hebrew I cannot call <a id="l218"></a>them hereticks, unless  any of them endeavoured to impose the law upon <a id="l219"></a>the Gentiles as necessary to salvation. Certainly Nazarenes was <a id="l220"></a>the name by which the Iews called the  Christians of the cir<a id="l221"></a>cumcision in  those days . For they called Paul a ringleader of the <a id="l222"></a>sect of the Nazarenes. Act 24.5. But the Ebionites accounted Paul an apostate from the Law &amp; rejected his Epistles &amp; therefore were for imposing the Law upon the Gentiles.</p>
<p id="par25"> The first age I extend to the death of Iohn the Apostle <a id="l223"></a>A.C. 100, or  rather to the death of Symeon the son of Cleopas <a id="l224"></a>bishop of Ierusalem who was crucified A.C. 107,  being <a id="l225"></a>120 years old.  This was in the virgin age of the Church,  as Hegesippus informs us. For hitherto saith Hegesippus<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> the Church continued  like a Virgin pure &amp; incorrupt being not yet corrupted with vain speeches.  <a id="l228"></a>  but after the holy company of Apostles were <a id="l229"></a>dead, errors &amp; heresies began to spring up very fast. Euseb. Hist.</p>
 <span class="pagenumber" id="p070r"> &lt;70r&gt; </span>
<p id="par27">The second age I extend to the death of Polycarp the disciple <a id="l241"></a>of Iohn A.C. 169. In his days the Gnosticks arose &amp; grew numerous <a id="l242"></a>but without breaking in upon the Church. For Irenæus who wrote against heresies in the days of Eleutherus Bishop of R. testifies that <a id="l243"></a>the faith in his days was one &amp; the same in all the Churches as you have <a id="l244"></a>heard above. And Hegesippus<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> a travellour that in his way to Rome he conversed with <a id="l245"></a>the Bishop of Corinth about the faith  to his comfort &amp; when he came <a id="l246"></a>to Rome (which was in the days of Anicetus) he conversed with many bishops <a id="l247"></a>&amp; found them all agree exactly in one &amp; the same doctrine, things <a id="l248"></a>remaining in the several cities as they had been taught by our Lord.</p>
<p id="par28">The third age may extend to the Persecution of Decius A.C. <a id="l249"></a>250 &amp; the fourth to the end of the heathen Empire A.C. 324. In <a id="l250"></a>the beginning of the third the very dangerous heresy of the false  Prophets Montanus <a id="l251"></a> &amp; his weomen Prisca &amp; Maximilla arose in  Phrygia &amp; in a short time prevailed so <a id="l252"></a>much in those parts as to subvert whole cities &amp; be called the Phrygian &amp; Cataphrygian heresy. <a id="l253"></a> And particularly it subverted &amp; exhausted the Church of Thyatira: in relation <a id="l254"></a>to which as Epiphanius  observes<sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> Christ saith in his prophetic Epistle to the  Angel or Bishop of that Church: <a id="l255"></a><em class="underline">I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman <a id="l256"></a>Iezabel who calleth her self a prophetess to teach &amp; to seduce my <a id="l257"></a>servants to commit</em>  <em class="underline">fornication &amp;</em>  <em class="underline">to eat things sacrificed to idols <a id="l258"></a>and I gave her space to repent of her fornication &amp; she repented <a id="l259"></a>not</em>. By things sacrificed to idols he means the  Eu<a id="l260"></a>charist of the Cataphrygians offered to a fals God, &amp; by committing fornication he <a id="l261"></a>means the committing  spiritual fornication  with the Prophetess Maximilla who taught the worship of that God: a God composed of the <a id="l263"></a>Bythos &amp; two Æons of the Gnosticks  &amp; recommended to the Christians by the <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>specious<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l264"></a>name of the Trinity or ffather Son &amp; holy Ghost.

This heresy by putting on a form of Godliness <a id="l269"></a> spread it self in all places &amp; in a short time gained <a id="l270"></a>so much upon the Church of Rome as to pervert  the bishop of that <a id="l271"></a>city, as Tertullian a Montanist in his book against Praxeas written about the year 201 thus mentions. <em class="underline">Idem</em> [Praxeas] <em class="underline">tunc Episcopum <a id="l272"></a>Romanum, agnoscentem jam prophetias Montani Priscæ et Maximillæ <a id="l273"></a>et ex ea agnitione pacem Ecclesijs Asiæ &amp; Phrygiæ inferentem, falsa de<a id="l274"></a>fendendo, coegit et literas pacis revocare jam emissas, et a proposito <a id="l275"></a>recipiendorum charismatum concessare.

For Soter wrote against them at their first rise <a id="l281"></a>&amp; was succeeded by Eleutherus the immediate predecessor of Victor, &amp; Irenæus a <a id="l282"></a> sharp enemy to all heresies &amp; a Presbyter of Lions in France upon some questions arising  in that city about the Cata<a id="l283"></a>phrygians, was sent by that Church to confer with Eleutherus  about the matter. <a id="l284"></a>&amp; what Eleutherus &amp; Irenæus agreed upon was no doubt against that hæresy. <a id="l285"></a>Hitherto therefore the Church of Rome continued firm in the faith, but <a id="l286"></a>after the death of Eleutherus began to stagger. For his successor Victor <a id="l287"></a> with a Council of the Bishops of Italy excommunicated the  Churches of Asia &amp; the neighbouring Provinces for keeping Easter on the <a id="l288"></a>14<sup>th</sup> day of the Moon, a thing in its own nature indifferent, &amp; practised <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p071r"> &lt;71r&gt; </span> in the Churches of Asia &amp; Syria from the days of the captivity. <a id="l289"></a>Whereupon Ireneus now bishop of Lions, called  a council <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>of the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l290"></a>neighbouring bishops &amp; in the name of the  council wrote to Victor <a id="l291"></a>reprehending him for his rashness in disturbing the peace of the <a id="l292"></a>church upon so slight an occasion, &amp; telling  him that Polycarp a <a id="l293"></a>few years before  came to Rome to confer with Anicetus bishop of <a id="l294"></a>that City about this &amp; some other questions which had been then <a id="l295"></a>moved, &amp; when neither  would forsake the customes of their churches  they communicated with one another &amp; <a id="l297"></a>parted very good friends  not thinking it a matter of such con<a id="l298"></a>sequence that they should  contend about it. <a id="l299"></a> And herein Poly<a id="l300"></a>carp, Anicetus &amp; Irenæus showed themselves men of the same spirit with <a id="l301"></a>the Apostle Paul who advised to avoid  foolish questions  vain jangling Iewish fables, <a id="l302"></a> endless genealogies, oppositions <a id="l303"></a>of science,  &amp; strifes of words whereof cometh envy strifes railings, evil surmisings <a id="l304"></a>pervers disputings of men of corrupt minds &amp; destitute of the truth.</p>
<p id="par29">When Victor excommunicated the Churches of Asia on account <a id="l305"></a>of this festival he seems to have been turned a Montanist, &amp; being <a id="l306"></a>corrupted in his mind with the superstitious principles of that heresy, to have laid <a id="l307"></a>stres upon  fasting days holydays bodily exercises &amp; ceremonies of religion, &amp; soon after he had <a id="l308"></a>excommunicated the true Churches of Asia on this account, to have sent out <a id="l309"></a>communicatory letters to the  corrupt Churches of Asia &amp; Phrygia <a id="l310"></a>with a designe to have united the Church of Rome to that of <a id="l311"></a>the Montanists in opposition to the excommunicated Churches  <a id="l312"></a>had not Praxeas perswaded him to recall his letters as contrary <a id="l313"></a>to what his predecessors Soter &amp; Eleutherius had taught. For the <a id="l314"></a>bishop of Rome who turned first Montanist &amp; then Praxean is in <a id="l315"></a>the Appendix to Tertullians book de præscriptiones called Victorinus in these words: <em class="underline">Sed post <a id="l316"></a>hos omnes etiam Praxeas quidam hæresin introduxit quam Victorinus <a id="l317"></a>corroboravit</em>. By Victorinus  I understand (with Basnagius) <a id="l318"></a>Pope Victor. ffor Tertullian was a Montanist <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> beforethe year 201 &amp; <a id="l319"></a> <a id="l321"></a>&amp; had been at Rome ashe mentions in his book de habitu muliebri <a id="l322"></a>c. 7 &amp;  upon his being  ill used by the clergy of the Roman Church turned <a id="l323"></a>Montanist as Ierome affirms. Which makes it probable that what he <a id="l324"></a>wrote about the Bishop of Rome &amp; Praxeas, he learnt at Rome before <a id="l325"></a>he turned Montanist, &amp;  by consequence in the days of Victor. ffor he wrote against <a id="l327"></a>Praxeas presently after he turned Montanist.</p>
<p id="par30">The hereticks allowed one anothers baptism, &amp; admitted one <a id="l328"></a>another into communion  by imposition of hands  alone. And  according to this doctrine the Roman Church <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> allowed the <a id="l331"></a>baptism of Praxeas:  But <a id="l332"></a>the churches of  the East &amp; Afric dissallowed the baptism of <a id="l333"></a>all hereticks.  And hence at length arose <a id="l334"></a>a great controversy between  the Church of Rome,  &amp; those other churches  the first in process of time allowing the Baptism of all hereticks, &amp; excommunicating <a id="l336"></a>the  last for  disallowing the same. This controversy was in the days of Pope Stephen <a id="l337"></a>A.C. 255. &amp;  gave the Church more disturbance  &amp; laid her more open to heresies then any thing which had happened before,  [the sacraments  of hereticks being in them here allowed   in the <a id="l341"></a>Church of Rome which was the greatest step that could be made towards <a id="l342"></a>a reconciliation with the mystery of iniquity. And  at this time also anniversary holydays   <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p072r"> &lt;72r&gt; </span> festivals to saints began  to be instituted in the Churches,  for inviting heathens into the Christian religion by the <a id="l344"></a>pleasure of such festivals as has been said above. And  auricular confession <a id="l345"></a>&amp;  corporal pennance came into use at the same time for avoiding the shame   of publick  trialls  before the Courts of Presbyters &amp; of  publick punishments inflicted by the Courts. Now these <a id="l348"></a>   changes in doctrine &amp; discipline were so very considerable that a <a id="l349"></a>new age of the Church may be reconned to begin therewith &amp; therefore <a id="l350"></a>I begin the fourth age of the Church with the persecution of Decius <a id="l351"></a>which introduced them.</p>
<p id="par31">The institution of auricular confession &amp; pennance is thus described by <a id="l352"></a>Sozomen. <sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>Cum in petenda venia  peccatum necessario confiteri oporteat: grave ac <a id="l354"></a>molestum ab initio juremerito visum est sacerdotibus, tanquam <a id="l355"></a>in theatro, circumstante totius ecclesiæ multitudine, crimina <a id="l356"></a>sua evulgare.

<p id="par32">The contention about the baptism of hereticks was as <a id="l368"></a>follows.

<p id="par34">After this Council  Cyprian wrote to ffirmilian Bishop of Cæsaria <a id="l456"></a>in  Cappadocia sending him a copy of Stephens letter. And <a id="l457"></a>ffirmilian wrote back a notable epistle in which there are these passages. <a id="l458"></a>Per singulos annos, seniores et præpositi in unum convenimus ad disponenda <a id="l459"></a>ea quæ curæ nostræ commissa sunt: ut siqua graviora sunt communi <a id="l460"></a>concilio dirigantur; lapsis quoque fratribus et post lavacrum salutare a <a id="l461"></a>diabolo vulneratis per pœnitentiam medela quæratur; non quasi a nobis <a id="l462"></a>remissionem peccatorum consequantur sed ut per nos ad  intelligentiam delictorum suorum convertantur et Domino pleni<a id="l464"></a>nius satisfacere cogantur. —— Qui κατάφρυγας appellantur &amp; <a id="l465"></a>novas prophetias usurpare conantur, nec patrem possunt <a id="l466"></a>habere nec filium nec spiritum sanctum quibus si quæramus <a id="l467"></a>quem  Christum prædicant, respondebunt eum se prædicare <a id="l468"></a>qui miserit spiritum per Montanum &amp; Priscam locutum.

<p id="par35">By these things it appears that  to satisfy the doubts <a id="l520"></a>of some persons, a numerous Council of the bishops of Asia &amp; Cappadocia  met at Iconium &amp; condemned the baptism &amp; <a id="l522"></a>sacraments of the Montanists &amp; of all other hereticks &amp; schismaticks some years <a id="l523"></a>before the disputes between Cyprian &amp; Stephen began, &amp; that <a id="l524"></a>Stephen quarreled as well with the oriental Churches as the <a id="l525"></a>African about this matter, &amp;  brake peace with <a id="l526"></a>all the churches about it except the western bishops of  Europe to whom he wrote not to receive those of the eastern <a id="l528"></a>&amp; African communion into their houses: but the eastern &amp; African <a id="l529"></a>Bishops did not excommunicate the western. It appears <a id="l530"></a>also that Stephen defended the baptism not only of the <a id="l531"></a>Cataphrygians &amp; Novatians but also that of Marcion <a id="l532"></a>Valentinus, Apelles &amp; all other hereticks, as Basnage in his Annals has abundantly proved.<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup></p>
<p id="par36">After the death of Stephen the Church of  <a id="l533"></a>Rome abated of her heats, let the excommunication drop <a id="l534"></a>&amp; returned into communion with the other Churches but <a id="l535"></a>continued to allow the baptism of all hereticks. For Ierome <a id="l536"></a>an hundred years after  <a id="l537"></a>defended the doctrine of the Roman Church against Hilary a Deacon of Rome in this manner.<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> Ad eos <a id="l538"></a>venio hæreticos qui evangelia laniaverunt, Saturninum quendam &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p075v"> &lt;75v&gt; </span> eosque ad jurgia et contentiones excitare equidem nolim.

About 50 years after this controversy Peter bishop of Alexandria <a id="l541"></a>having  excommunicated  the Meletians  admitted not their baptism. <a id="l542"></a>And  Athanasius long after  refused the baptism of the <a id="l543"></a>Arians.

<p id="par39">As the Church of Rome adhered to her custome of allowing the <a id="l569"></a>baptism of hereticks, so the rest of the Churches adhered to theirs  of disallowing it, <a id="l570"></a>as Basnage has proved.<sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup>  But when the Churches of Afric <a id="l571"></a>became divided into two parties headed by Cæcilian &amp; Donatus <a id="l572"></a>the party of  Cæcilian, which in the beginning of the <a id="l573"></a> schism was very small,  fell off from the  tradition <a id="l574"></a>of the African Churches  about baptism to that of the Church of Rome <a id="l575"></a>&amp; for that reason was supported by the Church of Rome against <a id="l576"></a>the other party which  retained the ancient tradition of <a id="l577"></a>the" churches of Afric,  And in the reign of Iulian the Apostate when the Churches <a id="l581"></a>of the whole Roman Empire were in the communion of the Bishops <a id="l582"></a>of the Councils of Ariminum &amp; Seleucia, Athanasius &amp; Eusebius <a id="l583"></a>Vercellensis &amp; about 14 or 15 other bishops returning from banishment &amp; <a id="l584"></a>meeting at Alexandria, agreed to receive the Arians as penitents without new <a id="l585"></a>baptism &amp; by this means the western doctrine became universal.
