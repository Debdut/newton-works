<span class="pagenumber" id="p001r"> &lt;1r&gt; </span><h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Chap. VIII <a id="l1"></a><br></h2>
<p id="par1">In the language of Prophesy Beasts &amp; Birds are put for nations <a id="l4"></a>&amp; kingdoms &amp; their several parts for the analogous parts of the <a id="l5"></a>kingdoms: as their heads for the governing parts, their horns <a id="l6"></a>for the military powers, their wings for the armies &amp; go<a id="l7"></a>vernments which they streach over nations, their bodies for <a id="l8"></a>the common people, their flesh for the riches, their bones for the fortified cities &amp; strong holds, their teeth nails &amp; hoofs <a id="l9"></a>for bands of soldiers, such as are Legions  &amp; Re<a id="l10"></a>giments,  the number of the heads horns or wings <a id="l11"></a>of any Beast for the number of governments dominions <a id="l12"></a>&amp; particular kingdoms in that Beast,  <a id="l13"></a>&amp; the life of the Beast for the continuance of the nation even <a id="l14"></a>after its dominion is taken away. And because shortlived Beasts <a id="l15"></a>are put for long lived kingdoms, the days of the Beasts are put for the yeares of the kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par2">The four Empires are represented by Daniel in  two several Visi<a id="l16"></a>ons, the first of which is Nebuchadnezzar's vision of the Image composed of four <a id="l17"></a>metalls. In expounding this, Daniel tells us that the golden head, the <a id="l18"></a>silver breast, the brazen belly &amp; thighs, &amp; the iron leggs <a id="l19"></a>signify four successive kingdoms whereof the first is that of <a id="l20"></a>Babylon. <em class="underline">Thou o king</em>, saith he to Nebuchadnessar, <em class="underline">art king <a id="l21"></a>of kings, for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom <a id="l22"></a>power &amp; strength &amp; glory &amp; wheresoever the children of <a id="l23"></a>men dwell, the beasts of the feild &amp; the fowls of the <a id="l24"></a>heaven</em> [that is the kingdoms of the world] <em class="underline">hath he given <a id="l25"></a>into thine hand  &amp; hath made the ruler over them <a id="l26"></a>all: Thou art this head of gold. And after thee</em> [that is, after <a id="l27"></a>thy kingdom] <em class="underline">shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee</em> [the <a id="l28"></a>Persian] <em class="underline">&amp; another third kingdom of brass</em> [the Greecian] <em class="underline">which <a id="l29"></a>shall beare rule over all the earth, &amp; the fourth kingdom</em> <a id="l30"></a>[the Roman] <em class="underline">shall be strong as iron forasmuch as iron breaketh <a id="l31"></a>in pieces &amp; subdueth all things</em>. – <em class="underline">And whereas thow sawest <a id="l32"></a>the feet &amp; toes part of potters clay &amp; part of iron, the kingdom <a id="l33"></a>shall be divided but there shall be in  <a id="l34"></a>it of the strength of iron – &amp; as the toes of the feet were part <a id="l35"></a>of iron &amp; part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong &amp; <a id="l36"></a>partly broken</em>,</p>
<p id="par3">The other is Daniels vision of the four Beasts, &amp; in expounding <a id="l37"></a>this Daniel tells us that the Lion, the Bear, the Leopard &amp; the <a id="l38"></a>dreadfull terrible &amp; exceedingly strong ten horned Beast which arose <a id="l39"></a>successively out of the great sea, are <em class="underline">four kingdoms which shall <a id="l40"></a>arise out of the earth</em>. And all interpreters agree that these kingdoms <a id="l41"></a>are the same with those signified by the four parts of the Image, <a id="l42"></a>the ten horns  of the fourth beast answering to the 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> ten toes of the iron leggs, &amp; the everlasting kingdom of the <a id="l43"></a>son of man which  reigns  after the four Beasts &amp; is over all <a id="l44"></a>nations &amp; shall not pass away (Dan. VII.14) answering to the stone <a id="l45"></a>which smote the Image upon its feet &amp; brake it to pieces &amp; became <a id="l46"></a>a great mountain &amp; filled the earth &amp; signifies a kingdom which <a id="l47"></a>God shall set up &amp; which shall break in pieces &amp; consume the former <a id="l48"></a>kingdoms &amp; not be left to other people but stand for ever. Dan. <a id="l49"></a>II.44, 45.</p>
<p id="par4">The Greeks &amp; Latines recconed the great Empires of the world <a id="l50"></a>in this order; the Assyrian, the Medic, the Persian, the Grecian &amp; <a id="l51"></a>the Roman.  If with Daniel we omit the Assyrian the four <a id="l52"></a>great Empires will be the Medic, the Persian, the Grecian &amp; the <a id="l53"></a>Roman. The Medic &amp; Babylonian arose together out of the Assy<a id="l54"></a>rian Empire &amp; were contemporary, &amp; being  brothers <a id="l55"></a>&amp; twins may either of them or both together be taken for the <a id="l56"></a>first of the four Empires. In the vision of the Ram &amp; He-Goat <a id="l57"></a>Daniel reccons the Medic in the first place &amp; the Persian in <a id="l58"></a>the second putting the  Rams two horns for those two Empires. <a id="l59"></a>In the vision of the Image Daniel puts the Babylonian in <a id="l60"></a>the first place saying to Nebuchadnezzar; <em class="underline">Thou art this <a id="l61"></a>head of gold</em>. In the vision of the four Beasts Daniel seems <a id="l62"></a>to represent both together by the first Beast with two Eagles wings. <a id="l63"></a>For the wings of a Beast represent the kingdoms of which <a id="l64"></a>the Beast is composed, as is manifest by the four wings <a id="l65"></a>of the Leopard. </p>
<p id="par5"><em class="underline">The first Beast</em>, saith Daniel, <em class="underline">was like a Lion</em> [mag<a id="l66"></a>nanimous &amp; strong] <em class="underline">&amp; had eagles wings</em>, stretching out its <a id="l67"></a>dominion over two large kingdoms the Babylonian &amp; the Medic. <a id="l68"></a><em class="underline">And I beheld</em>, saith Daniel, <em class="underline">till the wings thereof were <a id="l69"></a>pluckt</em>, that is, till its dominion was taken away. And then <a id="l70"></a> it was not slain but only fell <a id="l71"></a>down from that exalted  state of glory in which its kings were worshipped <a id="l72"></a>as Gods, &amp; being below on the earth <em class="underline">it was lifted up</em> [before] <em class="underline">&amp; made to stand <a id="l73"></a>on its</em> [hinder] <em class="underline">feet as a man &amp; a mans heart was given unto <a id="l74"></a>it</em>. Its life was therefore prolonged after its dominion was taken away.</p>
<p id="par6">The second Beast which <em class="underline">was like a Bear, raised it self up on <a id="l75"></a>one side</em> to signify that  it arose by raising one part of its people above <a id="l76"></a>the other, the Persians above the Medes. And  it had <em class="underline">three ribs in <a id="l77"></a>the mouth of it between the teeth of it</em>, as if it was  eating them <a id="l78"></a>that is  Sardes Babylon &amp;  Memphys the three imperial <a id="l79"></a>fenced cities of the conquered kingdoms of Lydia Babylonia &amp; Egypt. <a id="l80"></a>These it had in its mouth to distinguish them from its proper body. <em class="underline">And they said unto it, Arise devour much flesh</em>, that is, devour <a id="l81"></a>the flesh upon the ribs, or the riches of the three kingdoms. For <a id="l82"></a>the Medes &amp; Persians were poor people &amp; fared hardly &amp; were <a id="l83"></a>cloathed in leather untill they conquered those three  <a id="l84"></a>rich &amp; flourishing kingdoms,  whereby they grew very <a id="l85"></a>rich;  as Daniel notes also in another Prophesy,  saying <a id="l86"></a>that the fourth king of Persia shall be far richer then all the former <a id="l87"></a>&amp; by his power through his riches he shall stirr up all against the <a id="l88"></a>realm of Greece.</p>
<p id="par7">The third Beast was <em class="underline">like a Leopard</em> (nimble &amp; fierce) <em class="underline">&amp; had upon <a id="l89"></a>the back of it four wings of a fowl. The Beast had also four heads, &amp;</em> 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> <sup>dominion was given to it</sup>. It was therefore the Empire of <a id="l90"></a>the Greeks which after the reign of Alexander the great <a id="l91"></a>&amp; his sons, brake into four great kingdoms  to the four winds <a id="l92"></a>of heaven (Dan. XI.4) which kingdoms are here represented by the <a id="l93"></a>four wings &amp; four heads of this Beast.</p>
<p id="par8">The fourth Beast was therefore the Empire which reigned next <a id="l94"></a>after the Greeks &amp; subdued them. This Beast was <em class="underline">dreadfull &amp; <a id="l95"></a>terrible &amp; strong exceedingly &amp; had great iron teeth &amp; nails <a id="l96"></a>of brass &amp; devoured the whole earth &amp; trode it down &amp; <a id="l97"></a>brake it in pieces</em>, &amp; therefore it was the biggest the strongest <a id="l98"></a>&amp; the most warlike of all the Empires: &amp; such was the <a id="l99"></a>Roman. This Beast <em class="underline">was divers from all the former king<a id="l100"></a>doms</em>. They were  governed by kings this by a Senate <a id="l101"></a>&amp; Consuls. And it <em class="underline">had ten horns in its head, &amp; the ten <a id="l102"></a>horns out of this kingdom are ten kingdoms which shall <a id="l103"></a>arise</em>. This fourth beast is properly the Empire of the <a id="l104"></a>Latines . For all the four Beasts are still in being. The <a id="l105"></a> three first <em class="underline">had their d</em>ominions taken away by the Beasts <a id="l106"></a>which rose up next after them, <em class="underline">but their lives were pro<a id="l107"></a>longed</em>. The Lion had a mans heart given to it &amp; is still <a id="l108"></a>the nations of  Babylonia &amp; Media. The Bear is still <a id="l109"></a>the nations of  Persia. The Leopard is still the na<a id="l110"></a>tions of Greece Asia minor Egypt &amp; Syria, and the <a id="l111"></a>nations of the Roman Empire on this side Greece are the <a id="l112"></a>proper body of the fourth Beast. This Beast trode down <a id="l113"></a>the nations represented by the third Beast &amp; stamped upon <a id="l114"></a>them &amp; reigned over them till the building of Constan<a id="l115"></a>tinople &amp; the erecting of the Constantinopolitan Empire: <a id="l116"></a> &amp; as the second Beast <a id="l117"></a>had three ribs in his mouth to distinguish his conquests <a id="l118"></a>from his proper body so the nations of the former Em<a id="l119"></a>pires conquered by the  fourth Beast are to be distinguished from <a id="l120"></a>the proper body of that  Beast. Now that Beast <a id="l121"></a>upon the erecting of the Constantinopolitan empire being <a id="l122"></a>separated from the nations of the other Beast which <a id="l123"></a>he had trode down &amp; conquered, reigned alone in the west &amp; there <a id="l124"></a>brake into ten kingdoms A.C. 408 &amp; 409 as we shewed <a id="l125"></a>above, &amp; these kingdoms are its ten horns.</p>
<p id="par9">Now Daniel <em class="underline">considered the horns &amp; behold there came <a id="l126"></a>up among them another little horn before whom there were <a id="l127"></a>three of the first horns pluckt up by the roots &amp; behold in <a id="l128"></a>this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man &amp; a mouth <a id="l129"></a>speaking great things &amp; its look was more stout then its <a id="l130"></a>fellows, &amp; it made war with the saints &amp; prevailed against <a id="l131"></a>them</em>. And one that stood by &amp; made Daniel  know the 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> interpretation of these things told him that <em class="underline">the ten horns were <a id="l132"></a>ten kings that should arise &amp; another</em> [king] <em class="underline">should arise after <a id="l133"></a>them &amp; be divers from the first</em> [kings] <em class="underline">&amp; subdue three kings <a id="l134"></a>&amp; speak great words against the most High &amp; wear out the saints &amp; think to change <a id="l135"></a>times &amp; laws &amp;</em> <sup>that</sup> [after he had subdued the three kings] <sup>they should be given into his hand for a <a id="l136"></a>time times &amp; half a time</sup>. This little horn in being numbred <a id="l137"></a>amongst the other horns &amp; called a king must be a little <a id="l138"></a>kingdom: for by  horns &amp; kings Daniel understands king<a id="l139"></a>doms. But it was of a different kind from the other ten <a id="l140"></a>kingdoms having a life or soul peculiar to it self with eyes &amp; <a id="l141"></a>a mouth. By its eyes it was a Seer &amp; by its mouth speaking <a id="l142"></a>great things &amp; changing laws it was a Prophet as well as King. And such a <a id="l143"></a>Seer a  Prophet &amp; a King was the Church of Rome. This <a id="l144"></a>was a dominion very divers from all other dominions, &amp; the <a id="l145"></a>only dominion among the ten kingdoms to which the pro<a id="l146"></a>phesy of this horn can be applied</p>
<p id="par10">A Seer Ε᾽πίσκοπος is a Bishop in the litteral sense of <a id="l147"></a>the word, &amp; this Church claims the universal Bishopric.</p>
<p id="par11">With his mouth he gives laws to kings as an Oracle &amp; pretends to <a id="l148"></a>infallibility &amp; that his  dictates are binding to the whole world <a id="l149"></a>which is to be a Prophet in the highest degree. He claims <a id="l150"></a>a power of dispensing with Gods laws, of forgiving or retaining <a id="l151"></a>sins, of remitting or relaxing the pains of Purgatory &amp; Hell, <a id="l152"></a>of granting indulgencies, of canonizing saints, of dispensing of <a id="l153"></a>kingdoms by divine right, of absolving subjects from their oaths <a id="l154"></a>of allegiance &amp; of depriving all his opposers of heaven by <a id="l155"></a>excommunication. This is his mouth. This is his look more <a id="l156"></a>stout then his fellows. And he is the only dominion in the <a id="l157"></a>world who pretends to such an universal dictatorship &amp; <a id="l158"></a>who speaks such great words against the most High. How he rose up with such a spiritual power we have shewed above.

<p id="par12">The Francks were heathens till the reign of Clodovæus their <a id="l161"></a>king. He being converted to the Roman  religion A.C. 496 <a id="l162"></a>subjected his kingdom to the Pope, &amp; the Pope made Remigius Arch<a id="l163"></a>bishop of Rhemes his deputy Bishop over France.<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> This was the <a id="l164"></a> first considerable step  gained by the Pope towards the Vniversal <a id="l165"></a>Bishopric over the barbarous nations who had invaded the Empire. Then Clodovæus having gained a great victory over <a id="l166"></a>the Goths received from the Greek Emperor Anastasius a splendid <a id="l167"></a>crown adorned with gemms besides other presents: &amp; having <a id="l168"></a>worn it one day for that victory A.C. 507, sent it seven years <a id="l169"></a>after  a present to  the Pope, as more fit to adorn that <a id="l170"></a>august head then his own. This crown, as Sigebert tells us, was <a id="l171"></a>afterwards called Regnum, the  Kingdom. And this was <a id="l172"></a>the first instance of the Popes wearing a temporal crown as king of Rome.   But he had not yet a kingdom for which he should wear it. He was now  Lord of the  Province <a id="l179"></a>called the Alpes Cottiæ  but his Metropolis <a id="l181"></a> Rome with all Italy was  under the dominion of the Ostrogoths.<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup></p> 

<span class="pagenumber" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span><p id="par15">In the year 524, the Greek Emperor Iustin put <a id="l182"></a>out an Edict that the Churches of the Arians should <a id="l183"></a>be every where consecrated to the Catholick religion <a id="l184"></a>Whereupon Theodericus the Gothick king of Italy, sent <a id="l185"></a>Pope Iohn I with some of the Senators of Rome to <a id="l186"></a>the Emperor to tell him that unless he restored the <a id="l187"></a>Churches to their owners, he would treat the Catholicks <a id="l188"></a>in Italy in the same manner. The Pope going the <a id="l189"></a>next year upon this Embassy, was received very honour<a id="l190"></a>ably by the Emperour &amp; received great presents from <a id="l191"></a>him, &amp; instead of perswading the Emperour to restore <a id="l192"></a>the Churches, conspired with him against restoring <a id="l193"></a>them, &amp; consecrated as many of them as he could to <a id="l194"></a>the use of the Catholicks: &amp; upon his return to Italy <a id="l195"></a>was imprisoned for it by Theodericus his king, &amp; wrote from <a id="l196"></a>prison to the  bishops of Italy to arm themselves with the <a id="l197"></a>sword of the spirit against the Arian religion for extir<a id="l198"></a>pating it, &amp; to consecrate all the churches of the Arians <a id="l199"></a>(that is of the Goths) wherever they could find them, for <a id="l200"></a>the use of the Catholicks, as he had done at Constantinople. <a id="l201"></a>He was therefore confederate with the Greek Emperor <a id="l202"></a>against his king.</p>
<p id="par16">Iustinian succeeded Iustin, &amp; in the year 532 designing <a id="l203"></a>to make war upon the Vandals sent to Pope Iohn II great <a id="l204"></a>presents with an Epistle conteining a profession of his faith <a id="l205"></a>to be approved by his Holiness, &amp; represented therein that he <a id="l206"></a>had always a desire to keep the unity of the Apostolic seat <a id="l207"></a>&amp; therefore made hast to subject &amp; unite all the Priests <a id="l208"></a>of the whole eastern territory to the seat of his Holiness <a id="l209"></a>– which was the Head of all the Churches. This he did <a id="l210"></a>to engage all those of the Church of Rome in his party <a id="l211"></a>during the wars which he was going to make against <a id="l212"></a>those of another religion.</p>
<p id="par17">When he had conquered the Vandals &amp; was begin<a id="l213"></a>ning a war upon the Goths, Theodahatus their king the successor of <a id="l214"></a>Theodericus sent Pope Agapetus upon an embassy to Iusti<a id="l215"></a>nian for putting a stop to the war. Agapetus went very <a id="l216"></a>unwillingly, being in the Emperors interest &amp; was received very splendidly by the Emperor &amp; <a id="l217"></a>against the mind of the Emperor &amp; Empress, deposed Anthi<a id="l218"></a>mius Patriarch of Constantinople, &amp; substituted Mennas into <a id="l219"></a>that bishopric. Whence it is manifest that the Emperor <a id="l220"></a>for keeping the Church of Rome in his interest against <a id="l221"></a>the Goths still suffered the Bishop of Rome to act in the <a id="l222"></a>east as universal bishop.</p>
<p id="par18">The next year A.C. 536 Bellisarius having taken <a id="l223"></a>Sicily , sailed into Italy with the Emperors forces &amp; landing at <a id="l224"></a>Regium, the people in all the villages out of hatred to the <a id="l225"></a>Goths immediately came over to him. Thence he marched to <a id="l226"></a>Naples &amp; the Neopolitans were inclined to surrender, but the <a id="l227"></a>city being garrisoned by Goths held out a seige of 20 days. <a id="l228"></a>Thence he marched to Rome, the Romans by the perswasion 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> of Pope Silverius inviting him, &amp; promising to surrender <a id="l229"></a>their city so soon as he came near it. And this was done <a id="l230"></a>in December A.C. 536, the garrison of the Goths withdrawing <a id="l231"></a>when they found themselves betrayed. Sammicum, Calabria, Apulia <a id="l232"></a>Beneventum &amp; all Italy southward of Rome revolted also <a id="l233"></a>to Belisarius: &amp; so did Tuscia, Narnia, Spoletum, Perusia <a id="l234"></a>&amp; some other places. The next year the Goths besieged <a id="l235"></a>Rome with an army of an hundred &amp; fifty thousand men. <a id="l236"></a>Belisarius had but a small army of about 5000 men having left the greater part of his army in garrisons but being assisted by the Ro<a id="l237"></a>mans he held out the siege a whole year &amp; 9 days &amp; ruined <a id="l238"></a>the army of the Goths so that the Goths out of desperation <a id="l239"></a>were forced to raise the siege. Then Dacius Bishop of <a id="l240"></a>Millain with the chief men of that city went to Belisarius desiring him to send them a small force because <a id="l242"></a>Millain &amp; all Liguria were ready to revolt. And accordingly <a id="l243"></a>a force of a thousand men being sent, Millain with the greatest part of <a id="l244"></a>Liguria revolted, &amp; put the Goths upon besieging that City. <a id="l245"></a>And at the same time the garrison of the Goths in Ariminum <a id="l246"></a>suspecting the fidelity of the citizens retired &amp; left that <a id="l247"></a>city to the forces of Belisarius: which put the Goths upon be<a id="l248"></a>sieging that city also. ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 5v &gt; </span> </p>
<p id="par19">✝ They took Millain the next winter, levelled it even with the <a id="l253"></a>grownd, slew all the male citizens  to the <a id="l254"></a>number of three hundred thousand for revolting, &amp; gave the <a id="l255"></a>weomen to their allies the Burgundians for servants; but <a id="l256"></a>were forced to raise the siege  of Ariminum &amp; retire to <a id="l257"></a>Ravenna their  capital city, where they were be<a id="l258"></a>sieged by Belisarius &amp; forced to surrender A.C. 539, &amp; their King Vitiges <a id="l259"></a>with his Queen were sent prisoners to Constantinople. Thus <a id="l260"></a>the  Church of Rome by conspiring with <a id="l261"></a>the Greek Emperor against the Goths on account of re<a id="l262"></a>ligion, &amp; causing the Latines to revolt to the Greeks, gave such <a id="l263"></a>a turn to this war as enabled Belisarius with a small force <a id="l264"></a>assisted by the revolting Latines to ruin the Gothick Kingdom. <a id="l265"></a>And this was the first of the three horns which fell before <a id="l266"></a>the little horn. This Kingdom reigned over the Pope &amp; <a id="l267"></a>therefore was to be removed to make way for his rise. </p>
<p id="par20">After this Belisarius being recalled, the Goths took up arms <a id="l268"></a>again &amp; revived the war for a time &amp; in this contention Rome was <a id="l269"></a>almost dispeopled &amp; laid in ruins, &amp; the bishop of Rome lost his authority <a id="l270"></a>in the east till the Emperor Phocas restored it, &amp; the Lombards A.C. <a id="l271"></a>568 invading Italy, took from him the Alpes Cottiæ &amp; restored them <a id="l272"></a>not till the reign of Pope Iohn VI A.C. 704.</p>
<p id="par21">The Emperor Leo Isaurus A.C. 726 to put a stop to the wor<a id="l273"></a>ship of Images, which had been long overspreading the east, called a <a id="l274"></a>meeting of Councellours &amp; Bishops in his palace, &amp; by their advice <a id="l275"></a>put out an edict against that worship, &amp; wrote to Pope Gregory the <a id="l276"></a>2<sup>d</sup> that a general Council might be  called.

<p id="par24"> 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> Images, excommunicated the Greek Emperor, absolved his <a id="l300"></a>subjects in Italy from their obedience &amp; forbade them to pay <a id="l301"></a>tribute to him &amp; thereby got the City &amp; Duchy of Rome into his own hands <a id="l302"></a>&amp; caused a great part of the Exarchate or kingdom of Ravenna <a id="l303"></a>to revolt &amp; kill Paul the Exarch. And the Lombards also being <a id="l304"></a>Zealous for the worship of Images &amp; pretending to favour the <a id="l305"></a>cause of the Pope invaded the cities of the Exarchate.  </p>
<p id="par25"><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup>At length Pope Zechary A.C. 752 fearing the power of <a id="l310"></a>the Lombards deposed Childeric a sloathfull &amp; useless king <a id="l311"></a>of France &amp; the last of the race of Merovæus, &amp; absolving <a id="l312"></a>his subjects from their oath of allegiance gave the kingdom <a id="l313"></a>to Pipin  the Maior of the Pallace, hoping thereby <a id="l314"></a>to strengthen himself by making a new &amp; potent friend. <a id="l315"></a> <a id="l321"></a><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup>And The same year in March this Pope died, &amp; Stephen <a id="l322"></a>succeeded, &amp; before the end of the year the Lombards took <a id="l323"></a>Ravenna &amp; put an end to the Exarchate. And this is the <a id="l324"></a>second of the three kingdoms that fell  before the little horn.</p>
<p id="par26"><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup>Then Pope Stephen knowing better how to deale with <a id="l325"></a>the Greek Emperor then with the Lombards, went the next year <a id="l326"></a>to their king to perswade him to return the Exarchate to the <a id="l327"></a>Emperor, but this not succeeding he went into France &amp; <a id="l328"></a>perswaded Pipin to take the Exarchate &amp; Pentapolis from the <a id="l329"></a>Lombards &amp; give it to Saint Peter. And accordingly Pipin A.C. 754 <a id="l330"></a>came with an army into Italy &amp; made Aistulphus king of <a id="l331"></a>the Lombards promise the surrender. But the next year <a id="l332"></a>Aistulphus on the contrary, to revenge himself on the Pope <a id="l333"></a>besieged the city of Rome. Whereupon Pope Stephen sent letters <a id="l334"></a>to Pipin wherein he told him that if he came not speedily against <a id="l335"></a>the Lombards, <em class="underline">pro datâ sibi potentia alienandum fore a regno <a id="l336"></a>Dei et vita æterna</em>, he would excommunicate him.  Pipin therefore fearing a revolt of his new subjects &amp; being  indebted to the Church <a id="l338"></a>of Rome came speedily with an army into Italy, raised the siege, <a id="l339"></a>besieged the Lombards in Papia &amp; forced them to surrender the <a id="l340"></a>Exarchate &amp; region of Pentapolis to the Pope for a perpetual <a id="l341"></a>possession. And now Ravenna &amp; the rest of the Exarchate were <a id="l342"></a>surrendered some few cities excepted, &amp; the keys sent to Rome &amp; <a id="l343"></a>laid upon the Confession of Saint Peter, that is, upon his Tomb at <a id="l344"></a>the high Altar, <em class="underline">in signum veri perpetuique dominij sed pietate Regis <a id="l345"></a>gratuita</em>, as the inscription of a coin of Pipin has it. This was in 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> the year of Christ 755. And hence forward the Popes left off in <a id="l346"></a>their Epistles &amp; Bulls to note the years of the Greek Emperors <a id="l347"></a>as they had hitherto done.</p>
<p id="par27"><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>Afterwards the Lombards invading the Popes countries, Pope Adrian <a id="l348"></a>sent to Charles the great the son of Pipin to come to his assistance, <a id="l349"></a>and accordingly Charles entred Italy with an army, invaded the <a id="l350"></a>Lombards, overthrew their kingdome, became master of their coun<a id="l351"></a>tries, &amp; restored to the Pope not only  what they had taken from <a id="l352"></a>him but also the rest of the Exarchate which they had pro<a id="l353"></a>mised Pipin to restore to the Pope but had hitherto deteined, <a id="l354"></a>&amp; also gave him some cities of the Lombards &amp; was mutually made Patricius by the Romans. These things <a id="l355"></a>were done in the years 773 &amp; 774. And this is the third <a id="l356"></a>kingdom which fell before the little horn.</p>
<p id="par28"><sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup>The Pope reigned now over the Exarchate &amp; part <a id="l357"></a>of the kingdom of the Lombards, but some of his  sub<a id="l358"></a>jects being desirous to shake off his government &amp; recover <a id="l359"></a>their ancient  liberty raised a great commotion <a id="l360"></a>against him, accused him of certain crimes &amp; made him <a id="l361"></a>fly to the king of France. Whereupon Charles the great <a id="l362"></a>went again  to Rome with an armed force <a id="l363"></a> to resettle him, &amp; upon a day appointed presided in a <a id="l364"></a>Council of Italian &amp; French Bishops to hear both par<a id="l365"></a>ties. But when the Popes adversaries expected to be heard <a id="l366"></a>the Council declared that he who was the supreme Iudge <a id="l367"></a>of all men was above being judged by any other then <a id="l368"></a>himself. And thereupon the Pope made a solemn decla<a id="l369"></a>ration of his innocence, &amp; in recompence for the service <a id="l370"></a>&amp; honour done him created Charles Emperor of the Ro<a id="l371"></a>mans &amp; Charles at his coronation took this oath of Fealty <a id="l372"></a>to the Pope: <em class="underline">In nomine Christi spondeo atqque polliceor Ego <a id="l373"></a>Carolus Imperator coram Deo &amp; beato Petro Apostolo <a id="l374"></a>me protectorem ac defensorem fore hujus sanctæ Romanæ <a id="l375"></a>Ecclesiæ in omnibus utilitatibus quatenus divino fultus <a id="l376"></a>fuero adjutorio prout sciero poteroque</em>. This was done in <a id="l377"></a>December A. C. 800.</p>
<p id="par29">Thus the Pope &amp; his friend the king of France conspired to raise <a id="l378"></a>one another &amp; the Pope rose up among the ten kings by <a id="l379"></a>rooting up three of them before him. The kingdom of  the Ostrogoths he helped the Greek Emperor to subdue as Arian; the kingdom of Ravenna he gained to <a id="l381"></a>himself; &amp; the kingdom of Lombardy he divided between <a id="l382"></a>himself &amp;  the King of France. And in token that he is a king as <a id="l383"></a>well as a Bishop, he weares the crowns of  three king<a id="l384"></a>doms upon his head in form of a triple crown &amp; carries the <a id="l385"></a>keys of the cities of  the two last kingdoms in his hand. And <a id="l386"></a>being exalted above Kings &amp; Emperors &amp; declared by a Council <a id="l387"></a>above all humane judicature &amp; the supreme Iudge of all 

<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> men, he has reigned ever since amongst the  <a id="l388"></a>other horns with a peculiar soul &amp; a look more stout <a id="l389"></a>then his fellows. And having rooted up two of the three kings in <a id="l390"></a>favour of the worship of Images, he has changed times <a id="l391"></a>&amp; laws, &amp; set up the abomination in the western Empire.</p>
<p id="par30">His kingdom they call Peter's patrimony because given by <a id="l392"></a>Charles the great to Saint Peter. And for the same reason <a id="l393"></a>the keys of the cities of his kingdom they call Saint Peter's <a id="l394"></a>keys, they being offered to Saint Peter upon his Confession <a id="l395"></a>or Altar. But some turning history into an Alle<a id="l396"></a>gory tell us that the keys represent the power of binding <a id="l397"></a>&amp; loosing &amp; are the keys of heaven &amp; that the three <a id="l398"></a>crowns relate to heaven earth &amp; hell as if the Pope was <a id="l399"></a>crowned king of those three regions.  These are whimsies  which I need not stay to con<a id="l401"></a>fute.  Others come nearer the truth who tell us that the crowns denote the Pontifical Imperial &amp; Royal power of the Pope. For Peter's patrimony was taken partly from the Greek Emperor &amp; partly from the king of the Lombards.</p>

<p id="par36">5 In describing &amp; expounding his vision of the Ram &amp; He-Goat, he tells us that the <a id="l460"></a><em class="underline">Ram had two horns &amp; the two horns were high  but one was higher <a id="l461"></a>then the other &amp; the higher came up last</em> &amp; that the <em class="underline">Ram having two horns <a id="l462"></a>are the kings of Media &amp; Persia</em>, that is, the horn which came up first is the <a id="l463"></a>kingdom of Media &amp; the horn which came up last &amp; was higher then the other <a id="l464"></a>is the kingdom of Persia. This kingdom of Persia is the second Monarchy &amp; <a id="l465"></a>the kingdom of Media is contemporary to the first monarchy, &amp; therefore <a id="l466"></a>the Ram in the reign of his two horns comprehends all the times of the <a id="l467"></a>two first monarchies. The kingdoms of  Babylonia &amp; Media arose <a id="l468"></a>out of the Assyrian  Empire &amp; as collateral branches of  that Empire <a id="l469"></a>may  either of them or both together be taken for the Empire which reigned 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span>
next after the Assyrian &amp; next before the Persian, that is for the first <a id="l470"></a>  Empire when the Persian is accounted the second. The Greeks &amp; Latins <a id="l471"></a>accounted the Assyrian  Empire the first, the Medic the second, the Persian <a id="l472"></a>the third, the Grecian the fourth &amp; the Roman the fift, &amp; according to this <a id="l473"></a>recconing, if with Daniel we omit the Assyrian, the four  Empires will <a id="l474"></a>be the Medic, Persian, Grecian &amp; Roman. Daniel therefore puts the collateral Empire <a id="l475"></a>of the Medes &amp; Babylonians indifferently in the first place. In the vision <a id="l476"></a>of the Image he puts the Babylonian Empire in the first place saying to  <a id="l477"></a>Nebuchadnezzar <em class="underline">Thou art this head of gold</em>. In the vision of the Ram <a id="l478"></a>&amp; Goat he omitts the Empire of  Babylon &amp; puts the Empire of <a id="l479"></a>the Medes in the first place saying <em class="underline">the Ram with two horns</em> (one of <a id="l480"></a>which rose up before the other) <em class="underline">are the kings of Media &amp; Persia</em>. <a id="l481"></a>In the vision of the four Beasts he puts them both together <a id="l482"></a>in the first place,  representing them by the two great wings of the <a id="l483"></a>Lyon  like Eagles wings. For the wings of a <a id="l485"></a>Beast  signify the kingdoms of which the Beast is composed <a id="l486"></a>as is manifest by comparing the four wings of the Leopard with <a id="l487"></a>the four horns of the He Goat, both which signify the division of <a id="l488"></a>the Greek  Monarchy into four kingdoms to the four winds of <a id="l489"></a>Heaven. </p>

<p id="par37">The Greeks &amp; Latines recconed the great Empires of the world in this order: <a id="l490"></a>the Assyrian, Medic, Persian, Grecian &amp; Roman. If with Daniel we omit the Assyrian <a id="l491"></a>the four great Empires will be the Medic, Persian Grecian &amp; Roman. The Medic &amp; <a id="l492"></a>Babylonian rose together out of the Assyrian Empire &amp; were contemporary &amp; so <a id="l493"></a> may either of them or both together be taken for the first  Empire. In the vision of the Ram &amp; He Goat Daniel reccons  the Medic in the first <a id="l494"></a>place &amp; the Persian in the second, putting the Goats two horns for those two empires. <a id="l495"></a>In the vision of the metallic Image Daniel puts the Babylonian in the first place  <a id="l496"></a>saying to Nebuchadnezzar, <em class="underline">Thou art this head of gold</em>. In the vision of the four <a id="l497"></a>Beasts Daniel seems to represent both together by the  first Beast with eagles <a id="l498"></a>wings. For the wings of a Beast  represent the kingdoms of which the Beast is com<a id="l499"></a>posed as is manifest by the four wings of the Leopard. <em class="underline">The first Beast</em>, saith Daniel <a id="l500"></a><em class="underline">was like a Lion</em> (magnanimous &amp; strong) <em class="underline">&amp; had eagles wings</em>, streatching out its <a id="l501"></a>power over two large kingdoms the  Babylonian &amp; the Medic. <em class="underline">And  I beheld</em> <a id="l502"></a>saith Daniel, <em class="underline">till the wings thereof were pluckt</em>, that is, till its dominion was taken <a id="l503"></a>away, &amp;  when its dominion was taken away it was not slain but only fell down from that exalted  <a id="l504"></a>state in which its kings were worshipped as Gods, <em class="underline">&amp; it was lifted up</em> [before] <em class="underline">&amp; made to stand <a id="l505"></a> on its</em> [hinder] <em class="underline">feet as a man &amp; a mans heart was given unto it</em>.</p>

<p id="par38">For  the power by which the king of fierce countenance is mighty being not his own power must be  a power forreign to himself that is the Greeks, &amp;  this power must be a greater power then his own &amp; so can be only the <a id="l507"></a>power of the Romans . For if it  had been any power of the Greeks it would have been <a id="l508"></a>one of the Goats horns &amp;  this horn would have been <a id="l510"></a>then the little horn which came up last &amp; waxed exceeding great   <a id="l511"></a>So then the Goat in the reign of his last horn was great by a forreign power &amp; therefore reigned under such a power. <a id="l512"></a>  He signifies the same   thing with the Leopard. In the reign of his first horns <a id="l513"></a>he is the Leopard reigning by his own power: In the reign of his last horn he <a id="l514"></a>is the Leopard reigning by another's power  in this last reign he comprehends all the time that the <a id="l515"></a>life of the Leopard reigning is prolonged after  his proper dominion is taken away, that <a id="l516"></a>is all the time of the fourth Empire untill a stone cut out  without hands <a id="l517"></a>falls upon the feet of the Image &amp; breaks in pieces at once all the four parts <a id="l518"></a>of the Image. And  therefore its said that the vision  is at the time of <a id="l519"></a>the end &amp; in the last end of the indignation Dan. VIII.17, 19, that is, it reaches to <a id="l520"></a>the end of all Daniels visions &amp; to the last end of the Iewish captivity. It reaches to the end of 2300 days &amp; days in all Daniels prophesies signify years // The last <a id="l521"></a>horn of the Goat is described great above all the former horns, exceeding great  in breadth by conquering eastward  <a id="l522"></a>&amp; southward,  great up to the host of  heaven &amp; therefore can signify nothing less then the mighty power of the <a id="l524"></a>Greeks under the administration of the Romans, this being the only power <a id="l525"></a>in the world that has hitherto  been greater then the power  of Alexander the great. [For where <a id="l526"></a>the parts of prophesy are not adapted to the parts of history in due proportion the <a id="l527"></a>interpretation is frivolous &amp; trifling.]</p>


<p id="par41">As a Beast may continue after its dominion is so may a horn. For <a id="l528"></a>the Rams  first horn continued upon his head   after the Medes were conquered by the Persians. And tho the Persian Empire <a id="l530"></a>had but one Monarch yet the Ram had two horns till he was vanquished by <a id="l531"></a>the Goat. And in like manner we are to conceive that the Goat has <a id="l532"></a>four horns till the end of the reign of the Leopard or third monarchy notwithstanding any conquests <a id="l533"></a>that the horns may make upon one another.   And when Daniel tells us that <a id="l534"></a>in the  end of their kingdom when the transgressors are come <a id="l535"></a>to the full a king of fierce countenance shall stand up:  we are to understand  
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012v"> &lt;12v&gt; </span>  that this king  stands up in the end of the third Empire &amp; beginning <a id="l539"></a>of the fourth. But these things will be best understood by comparing them <a id="l540"></a>with the prophesy of the scripture of truth which is a commentary upon the vision of the Ram &amp; He Goat <a id="l541"></a>For there Daniel describes the breaking of the Greek monarchy into <a id="l542"></a>four great kingdoms  to the four winds of heaven <a id="l543"></a>&amp; tells the actions of the kings of the north &amp; south which are two of <a id="l544"></a>the four,  &amp; prosecutes their history down to the eighth year of the reign of Antiochus <a id="l545"></a>Epiphanes, the year in which Antiochus came east out of Egypt &amp; set up the religion of the heathens <a id="l546"></a>in the Temple &amp; in all Iudæa, &amp; there Daniel  concludes the history of the kings of the north &amp; south with these words: For the ships of Chittim . . . . forsake the holy covenant. There Daniel breaks off &amp; in the next words passes to the Romans reigning over the Greeks.  saying, <em class="underline">And after him arms shall stand up</em>. For in this very <a id="l548"></a>year the Romans  &amp; king of Pergamus conquered the kingdom <a id="l549"></a>of Macedon which  being the mother kingdom of the Greeks , the fall <a id="l550"></a>thereof may be recconed to put an end to the Greek Empire &amp; give a beginning <a id="l551"></a>to the Roman. ‡</p>

And therefore its said that the <a id="l674"></a>vision is at the time of the end &amp; in the last end of the in<a id="l675"></a>dignation (Dan. VIII.17, 19,) that is, it reaches to the end of all <a id="l676"></a>Daniels visions  &amp; to the last end of the Iewish capti<a id="l677"></a>vity. // It reaches to the end of  2300 days &amp; in all Daniels <a id="l678"></a>prophesies days are put for years. The Iews kept no account <a id="l679"></a>of time by days longer then a month. They counted the age of <a id="l680"></a>the Moon or days of the month, &amp; the months or Moons in <a id="l681"></a>a year, but their months &amp; years consisted of no certain <a id="l682"></a>number of days; &amp; for Daniel to tell the Iews of an <a id="l683"></a>exact period of 2300 natural days when they had no <a id="l684"></a>method in use of counting that number nor could deter<a id="l685"></a>min by their years &amp; months the number of days in <a id="l686"></a>any period of time past, would have been very improper <a id="l687"></a>&amp; therefore days in  this prophesy as well as in all <a id="l688"></a>the rest of Daniels prophesies  are <a id="l689"></a>types of years, &amp; 2300 years are not yet expired.</p>
<p id="par56">The last horn of the Goat is described great above <a id="l690"></a>all the former horns, exceeding great in length &amp; breadth <a id="l691"></a> eastward &amp; southward,  &amp; great in height up to the host <a id="l692"></a>of heaven: and therefore can signify nothing less then the <a id="l693"></a>mighty power of the Greeks under the administration of the <a id="l694"></a>Romans, this being the only power in the world that has hitherto <a id="l695"></a>been greater then the power of Alexander the great.</p>
<p id="par57">The little horn of the Goat is by some taken for Antiochus <a id="l696"></a>Epiphanes but very injudiciously. A horn of a Beast is never taken <a id="l697"></a>for a single person. A new horn always signifies a new kingdom <a id="l698"></a>&amp; the kingdom of Antiochus was an old one.

<p id="par58"> The Goat &amp; the Leopard are one &amp; the same kingdom reigning  by their one  power  untill their dominion  is taken away,  &amp; surviving the loss of <a id="l701"></a>their dominion &amp; by consequence after their own dominion is taken away, reigning by <a id="l702"></a>&amp; under the power of another. In this vision of the four Beasts Daniel describes <a id="l703"></a>only the reign of the Leopard by his own power  &amp; tells you that after his dominion <a id="l704"></a>is taken away his life should be prolonged: here  in the vision of the Goat he first <a id="l705"></a>repeats the reign of the Leopard by his own power  untill the end of the <a id="l706"></a>kingdom of the four horns  of the Goat &amp; then under the type <a id="l707"></a>of the Goat reigning in a new horn he describes the life &amp; actions of the Leopard <a id="l708"></a>after his dominion is taken away &amp;  tells you that his power should <a id="l710"></a>be mighty but not by his own power.  He represents this horn great above <a id="l711"></a>all the former horns, exceeding great in  breadth eastward &amp; southward, &amp; great in <a id="l712"></a>height up to the host or stars of heaven but not by his own power., &amp; this can signify nothing less then the mighty <a id="l713"></a>power of the Greeks  by &amp; under the  administration of the Romans, this being the only <a id="l714"></a>– – – Alexander the great. So then the Goat in the reign of his last horn  is the Leopard <a id="l718"></a>surviving the loss of his dominion &amp; being still mighty but not by his own power <a id="l719"></a> &amp; living  in this state till the stone  <a id="l720"></a>falls upon the feet <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span> of the Image &amp; brakes in pieces all the four  parts of <a id="l721"></a>the Image at once that is till the end of the fourth monarchy. For the nations of <a id="l722"></a>the Greeks in Europe Asia Syria &amp; Egypt are still mighty but not by their own power. They were formerly mighty <a id="l723"></a>by the power of the Romans &amp; they are now mighty by the power of the Turks &amp; <a id="l724"></a>Daniel tells us that the vision of the Goat reigning in his last horn is at the time of the <a id="l725"></a>end &amp; in the last end of the Indignation Dan VIII.17, 19), that is it reaches to the end of all Daniels <a id="l726"></a>visions &amp; to the last end of the Iewish captivity.</p>
<p id="par59">The  last horn of the Goat is by some</p>

<p id="par60">The character of the little horn answers much better to the kingdom of <a id="l727"></a>Pergamus then to Antiochus Epiphanes. For this was a new kingdom different <a id="l728"></a>from the four. It  came out of the western side of the <a id="l729"></a>king of the north</p>
<sup class="note" id="ed1-ref">[Editorial&nbsp;Note&nbsp;1]</sup>
<p id="par61" class="i0">so the arms grew out of the substance kingdom of the north untill they had conquered the <a id="l730"></a>whole kingdom, &amp; this conquest was made partly before partly after the reign of Antiochus. <a id="l731"></a>so that you may understand the phrase <em class="underline">arms out of him shall stand up</em> to signify <a id="l732"></a>arms which came out of him shall stand up or arms shall stand up out of him <a id="l733"></a>&amp; in either sense it signifies the kingdom of Pergamus waxing great out of the king<a id="l734"></a>dom of the north.</p></div>
<div><span class="pagenumber" id="p014v"> &lt;14v&gt; </span>
<sup class="note" id="ed2-ref">[Editorial&nbsp;Note&nbsp;2]</sup>
<p id="par62">Daniel tells us that the little came out of one of the fourth horns that is out <a id="l735"></a>it side as a branch   <a id="l736"></a> so that the horn &amp; its branch <a id="l737"></a>appeared together  in the form of two horns upon one base  the lesser of <a id="l738"></a>which grew out of the greater &amp; this signifies the division of one of the four  kingdoms <a id="l739"></a>into two the lesser of which arises  &amp; increases out of the  substance of the greater. Daniel <a id="l740"></a>tells us also that this little horn waxed exceeding great towards the south &amp; towards the <a id="l741"></a>east &amp; therefore it arose in the northwest corner of the Greek monarchy &amp; con<a id="l742"></a>quered southward &amp; eastward. And in expounding this vision he tells that in the  end <a id="l743"></a>of the kingdom of the four  horns  when the transgressors are come <a id="l744"></a>to the full, a king of fierce countenance should stand up &amp; be mighty but not by his own power, that is, the little horn should then <a id="l745"></a>stand up over the nations of the Greeks  by conquering southward &amp; eastward, &amp; thereby <a id="l746"></a>become exceeding great but  not by his own power. And by all this I conclude <a id="l747"></a>that the little horn is the kingdom of Pergamus. For that kingdom arose on the western side of <a id="l748"></a>the northern horn. It was at first only a castle with a small district in the western border of Asia minor. By degrees it increased <a id="l749"></a>in power &amp; at length took from the kingdom of the north  allmost all Asia on this side the <a id="l750"></a>mountain Taurus &amp; beating also the Gauls to whom it had been tributary the governor of  Pergamus was saluted king by his army. Thus it grew by the side &amp; out of the substance of the Northern <a id="l752"></a>horn  in form of a little horn. Afterwards it lost part of its territories to Antiochus the great but <a id="l753"></a>recovered all again by the assistance of the Romans. And continuing in strickt league with <a id="l754"></a>the Romans it assisted them in conquering the kingdom of Macedon an Philip 156 An. Sam. 933 [which was one of the <a id="l755"></a>four horns,  [&amp; in the same <a id="l756"></a>year the transgressors of the holy covenant conspired with the Greeks to set up the abomination in the Temple &amp; cities of <a id="l757"></a>Iudea. This was  in the 8<sup>th</sup> year of Antiochus an. Philip. 156. an. Sam. 933 Then the kingdom of Pergamus  which had hitherto been a little horn, was by the <a id="l758"></a>last will &amp; testament of its last king Attalus an. Sam. 969 &amp;  thereby  became a king of fierce countenance <a id="l759"></a>It was not conquered &amp; broken  in pieces but continued in the hands  as a gift <a id="l760"></a>The Romans succeeded Attalus in the throne of this kingdom by a legal right &amp; reigned over it in the room of <a id="l761"></a><span class="gap" title="Text is illegible because the manuscript is foxed">{illeg}</span> kings &amp; by their administration it became a king or kingdom of fierce countenance. Then <a id="l762"></a>it conquered the kingdom of Syria, An.  Sam. 1037 &amp; the kingdom of Iudea  <a id="l763"></a>the next year &amp; the kingdom of Egypt An. Sam. 1071 &amp; by conquering those three kingdoms <a id="l764"></a> it stood up &amp; became exceeding great towards the south &amp; towards the <a id="l765"></a>east &amp; towards the pleasant land, but not by its own power.</p>

<p id="par63">After this the little horn grew up to the host of heaven &amp; cast down of the <a id="l766"></a>host &amp; stars to the grownd. Then it magnified it self to the Prince of the host &amp; took away <a id="l767"></a>the dayly worship. But for understanding these things its necessary to compare this vision <a id="l768"></a>of the Ram &amp; Goat with the Prophesy of the Scripture of  truth. For they both <a id="l769"></a>concern the nations of the Greek Empire reigning first by their own power &amp; then <a id="l770"></a>by the power of others till the end of the four Monarchies, &amp; the last is a commentary upon the first </p>
<p id="par64">In the prophesy of the scripture of truth Daniel tells us how the <a id="l772"></a>first Monarchy of the Greeks should be broken into four great kingdoms to <a id="l773"></a>the four winds of heaven, &amp; then describes the history of the kings or king<a id="l774"></a>doms of the north &amp; south which are two of the four &amp; prosecutes the descri<a id="l775"></a>ption down to the 8<sup>th</sup> year of Antiochus Epiphanes &amp; there breaks of &amp; <a id="l776"></a>passes to the description of the little horn or king of fierce countenance in <a id="l777"></a>these words, <em class="underline">And arms out of him shall stand <a id="l778"></a>up</em>.
