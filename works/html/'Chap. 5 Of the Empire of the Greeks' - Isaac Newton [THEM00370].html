<p id="par1">Alexander the great having conquered all the Persian Empire <a id="l4"></a>&amp; some part of India died at Babylon a month before the summer <a id="l5"></a>solstice in the year of Nabonassar 425 An. 1. Olymp. 114 &amp; his captains <a id="l6"></a>gave the Monarchy to his bastard brother Philip Aridæus, <a id="l7"></a>a man disturbed in his understanding, &amp; made Perdiccas admi<a id="l8"></a>nistrator of the kingdom, &amp; Perdiccas with their consent made <a id="l9"></a>Meleager commander of the army, Seleucus master of the <a id="l10"></a>horse, Craterus treasurer of the kingdom, Antipater gover<a id="l11"></a>nour of Macedon &amp; Greece, Ptolomy governour of Egypt, Anti<a id="l12"></a>gonus governour of Pamphilia Lycia Lycaonia &amp; Phrygia <a id="l13"></a>major, &amp; other Captains governours of other Provinces, as many <a id="l14"></a>of them had been before in the reign of Alexander the great. <a id="l15"></a>And the Babylonians began now to count by a new Æra which <a id="l16"></a>they called the Æra of Philip, using the years of Nabonassar <a id="l17"></a>&amp;  recconing the 425<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l18"></a>of Nabonasser to be the first year of Philip. And Rhoxane <a id="l19"></a>the wife of Alexander being left big with child &amp; about <a id="l20"></a>three of four months after his death brought to bed of a <a id="l21"></a>son, they called him Alexander &amp; saluted him king, joyning <a id="l22"></a>him with Philip in the throne of the kingdom.</p>
<p id="par2">Philip reigned three years under the administratorship <a id="l23"></a>of Perdiccas, two years more under the administratorship of <a id="l24"></a>Antipater &amp; above a year more under the administrator<a id="l25"></a>ship of Polysperchon, in all six years &amp; four months &amp; <a id="l26"></a>then was slain with his Queen Eurydice in September by <a id="l27"></a>the command of Olympias the mother of Alexander the <a id="l28"></a>great. And the Greeks being disgusted at the cruelties of <a id="l29"></a>Olympias revolted to Cassander the son &amp; successor of Antipater.</p>
<p id="par3">Cassander affecting the dominion of Greece slew <a id="l30"></a>Olympias &amp; soon after shut up the young king Alexander <a id="l31"></a>with his mother Rhoxane in the castle of Amphipolis <a id="l32"></a>under the charge of Glaucias,  An. Nabonass. 432</p>
<p id="par4">The next year Ptolomy Cassander &amp; Lysimachus by the <a id="l33"></a>means of Seleucus made a league against Antigonus &amp; after <a id="l34"></a>certain wars they made peace with him  An. Nabonass. 438 <a id="l35"></a>upon these conditions that Cassander should command the forces <a id="l36"></a>of Europe till Alexander the son of Rhoxane came to age <a id="l37"></a>&amp; that Lysimachus should govern Thrace, Ptolomy Egypt, <a id="l38"></a>&amp; Libya, &amp; Antigonus all Asia. Seleucus had possest himself <a id="l39"></a>of Mesopotamia Babylonia Susiana &amp; Media the year before. <a id="l40"></a>About three years after Alexanders death he was made Go<a id="l41"></a>vernor of Babylon by Antipater, then was expelled by Antigonus, <a id="l42"></a>&amp; now he recovered &amp; enlarged his government over a great <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span>part of the east: which gave  occasion to a new Æra <a id="l43"></a>called Æra Seleucidarum. This Æra was of Luni-solar <a id="l44"></a>years &amp; according to the Iewish account it began in spring An. <a id="l45"></a>Philip. 12. An. 4. Olymp. 116, but according to the Chaldæan account it <a id="l46"></a>began the spring following &amp; according to the Antiochian &amp; Alex<a id="l47"></a>andrian account it began in the autumn between the two springs <a id="l48"></a>each nation adapting it to the beginning of their own Luni-<a id="l49"></a>solar years.</p>
<p id="par5">Not long after the peace made with Antigonus (Diodorus <a id="l50"></a>saith the same  Olympic year) Cassander seing that <a id="l51"></a>Alexander the son of Roxane grew up, &amp; that it was discoursed <a id="l52"></a>throughout Macedonia that it was fit he should be set at <a id="l53"></a>liberty &amp; take upon him the government of his fathers <a id="l54"></a>kingdom, commanded Glaucias the governour of the Castle <a id="l55"></a>to kill Rhoxane &amp; the young king Alexander her son &amp; <a id="l56"></a>conceale their deaths. Then Polysperchon set up Hercules <a id="l57"></a>the son of Alexander the great by Barsine to be king, &amp; soon <a id="l58"></a>after at the sollicitation of Cassander caused him to be <a id="l59"></a>slain. And soon after that, upon a great victory at sea got by <a id="l60"></a>Demetrius the son of Antigonus over Ptolomy, Antigonus <a id="l61"></a>took upon himself the title of king &amp; gave the same title <a id="l62"></a>to his son, An. 2 Olymp. 118. This was Ann. Nabonass. 441 And after his example Seleucus <a id="l63"></a>Cassander Lysimachus &amp; Ptolomy took upon themselves <a id="l64"></a>the title &amp; dignity of kings, having absteined from this <a id="l65"></a>honour while there remained any of Alexanders race <a id="l66"></a>to inherit the crown. And thus the Monarchy of the Greeks <a id="l67"></a>for want of an heir was broken into several kingdoms, four <a id="l68"></a>of which seated to the four winds of heaven were very emi<a id="l69"></a>nent. For Ptolomy reigned over Egypt Libya &amp; Ethiopia, <a id="l70"></a>Antigonus over Syria &amp; the lesser Asia,  Lysimachus in Thrace &amp; Cassander over <a id="l72"></a>Macedon Greece &amp; Epire.  <a id="l73"></a> And all this Daniel, after he had mentioned the kings of the <a id="l74"></a>Medes &amp; Persians &amp; their invasion of Greece, describes in this <a id="l75"></a>manner. <em class="underline">And a mighty King</em> [Alexander] <em class="underline">shall stand up &amp; shall <a id="l76"></a>rule with great dominion &amp; do according to his will. And when he <a id="l77"></a>shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken &amp; shall be divided <a id="l78"></a>towards the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity</em> <a id="l79"></a>[&amp; therefore not  before their death] <em class="underline">nor according to his <a id="l80"></a>dominion wherewith he ruled: for his kingdom shall be <a id="l81"></a>pluckt up even for others besides those</em>, [such as were Seleucus in Babylonia  &amp; all Persia beyond Euphrates &amp; Sandrocottus in India.]</p>
<p id="par6">Cassander being afraid of the power of Antigonus combined <a id="l83"></a>with Lysimachus Ptolomy &amp; Seleucus against him; &amp; while <a id="l84"></a>Lysimachus invaded the parts of Asia next the Hellspont &amp; <a id="l85"></a> Ptolomy subdued Phœnicia &amp; Cælosyria &amp; the seacoasts of <a id="l86"></a>Asia, Seleucus having newly made peace with Sandrocottus <a id="l87"></a>came down with a powerful army into Cappadocia, &amp; joyning <a id="l88"></a>the confederate forces fought Antigonus in Phrygia &amp; slew him <a id="l89"></a>&amp; seized his kingdom an. 4 Olymp. 119. Ann. Nabonass. 447. After which Seleucus built <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> Antioch Seleucia Laodicea Apamea Berrhæa Edessa &amp; other <a id="l90"></a>cities in Syria &amp; Asia &amp; in them granted the Iews equal pri<a id="l91"></a>vileges with the Greeks.</p>
<p id="par7">Yet Demetrius the son of Antigonus retained a small <a id="l92"></a>part of his fathers dominions &amp; at length lost Cyprus to Pto<a id="l93"></a>lomy: but killing Alexander the son &amp; successor of Cassander <a id="l94"></a>king of Macedon seized his kingdom An. 3 Olymp. 121 An. Nabonass. 454, &amp; <a id="l95"></a>sometime after preparing a very great army to recover <a id="l96"></a>his fathers dominions in Asia, Seleucus Ptolomy &amp; Lysi<a id="l97"></a>machus &amp; Pyrrhus king of Epire combined against <a id="l98"></a>him &amp; Pyrrhus invading Macedonia corrupted the army <a id="l99"></a>of Demetrius, put him to flight, seized his kingdom &amp; shared it with Lysimachus. And after seven months <a id="l100"></a>Lysimachus beating Pyrrhus took Macedonia from him <a id="l101"></a>&amp; held it five years &amp; an half, uniting the kingdoms <a id="l102"></a>of Macedon &amp; Thrace.</p>
<p id="par8">Lysimachus in his wars with Antigonus &amp; Deme<a id="l103"></a>trius, had taken from them Caria Lydia &amp; Phrygia &amp; <a id="l104"></a>had a treasury in Pergamus a castle on the top of a <a id="l105"></a>conical hill in Phrygia by the river Caicus, &amp; had <a id="l106"></a>committed the custody thereof to one Philetærus who <a id="l107"></a>was at first faithful to Lysimachus but in the last <a id="l108"></a>year of his reign revolted. For Lysimachus by the <a id="l109"></a>instigation of his wife Arsinoe slew first his own son <a id="l110"></a>Agathocles &amp; then those who lamented him. Upon <a id="l111"></a>which the wife of Agathocles fled with  her children <a id="l112"></a>&amp; brothers &amp; some others of their friends, &amp; sollicited <a id="l113"></a>Seleucus to make war upon Lysimachus. And Philetærus <a id="l114"></a>also grieving at the death of Agathocles &amp; being ac<a id="l115"></a>cused thereof by Arsinoe revolted &amp; sided with Se<a id="l116"></a>leucus. On this occasion Seleucus &amp; Lysimachus met <a id="l117"></a>&amp; fought in Phrygia, &amp; Lysimachus being slain in the <a id="l118"></a>battel lost his kingdom to Seleucus, An. 4 Olymp. 124 An. Nabonass. 465. <a id="l119"></a>Thus the Empire of the Greeks which at first brake into <a id="l120"></a>four great kingdoms became now reduced into two <a id="l121"></a>notable ones henceforward called by Daniel the kings <a id="l122"></a>of the south and north. For Ptolomy now reigned over <a id="l123"></a>Egypt Libya Ethiopia Arabia Phœnicia Cælosyria &amp; Cyprus <a id="l124"></a>&amp; Seleucus having united three of the four kingdoms had <a id="l125"></a>a dominion   scarce inferior to that of the Persian Empire <a id="l126"></a>conquered by Alexander. All which is thus represented by <a id="l127"></a>Daniel. <em class="underline">And the king of the south</em> [Ptolomy] <em class="underline">shall become <a id="l128"></a>strong, &amp; one of his Princes</em> [Seleucus one of Alexander's <a id="l129"></a>Princes] <em class="underline">shall become strong above him &amp; have dominion: <a id="l130"></a>his dominion shall be a great dominion</em>.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span>

And thence arose a <a id="l207"></a>various war between Antiochus &amp; Epiphanes, they seizing <a id="l208"></a>Phœnicia &amp; Cælosyria by turns whereby those countries were much afflicted by both parties. First Antiochus seized <a id="l209"></a>those countries, then one Scopas being sent with the <a id="l210"></a>army of Egypt recovered them from Antiochus, &amp; the <a id="l211"></a>next year (anno Philippi 126) Antiochus fought &amp; <a id="l212"></a>routed Scopas  neare the fountains of Iordan, besieged <a id="l213"></a>him in Sidon,  took the city &amp; recovered Syria &amp; Phœ<a id="l214"></a>nicia from Egypt the Iews coming over to him voluntarily. But about three years after upon <a id="l215"></a>preparing for a war against the Romans he came to Raphia in the borders of Egypt &amp; made <a id="l216"></a>peace with Epiphanes &amp; gave him his daughter Cleo<a id="l217"></a>patra, &amp; the next autumn passed the Hellespont to <a id="l218"></a>invade the cities of Greece under the Roman protection <a id="l219"></a>&amp; took some of them but was beaten by the Romans <a id="l220"></a>the summer following &amp; forced to return back with <a id="l221"></a>his army into Asia.
