     <p id="par1">Herod according to Iosephus reigned 34 years from the taking of Ierusalem by <a id="l1"></a>&amp; 37 years from his being declared king by the senate. These years end in Iuly or Au<a id="l2"></a>gust two years &amp; an half from the vulgar Æra. And Herod died  of a lingering distemper <a id="l3"></a> in November following. For the Iews in their Kalendar set down his death upon the <a id="l4"></a>6<sup>th</sup> of the Month Kisleu. And Iosephus tells us  that in the time of his sickness he sent Embassadors to Augustus at Rome, † † &amp; received letters back which agrees best with summer when the seas were navigable &amp; that there was an eclips of the Moon in the time an Eclips of the Moon in the <a id="l5"></a>time of his sickness soon after the sending of the Embassy which Eclips happened upon Aug. 20. He died therefore two years <a id="l6"></a>&amp; a month before the vulgar Æra &amp; Christ might be born a few months before. <a id="l7"></a>For the children slain in Bethlehem were under two yearlings that is not yet entered <a id="l8"></a>upon their second year &amp; the  wise men came from the east while Ioseph <a id="l9"></a>&amp; Mary lodged in the Inn with the new born child.  And by this recconing Christ might be  30 years old in the beginning <a id="l15"></a>of the 15<sup>th</sup> year of Tiberius &amp; be baptized before he was 31 years old <a id="l16"></a>&amp; suffer A. C. 33  counting four passovers after his baptism or rather A. C. <a id="l17"></a>34  counting five. # <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 1r &gt; </span># For it seems to me that there were five, the first while Iohn was baptizing Iohn 2.13. <a id="l18"></a>the second four months after Iohn's imprisonment.  For Christ staid in <a id="l19"></a>Iudea baptizing till the imprisonment of Iohn, &amp; then went into Galile four months <a id="l20"></a>before the harvest  Iohn 4.35. And  after this there was a feast of the Iews <a id="l21"></a> &amp; Iesus went up to Ierusalem  Iohn. 5.1. And therefore this feast was either <a id="l22"></a>the second passover or a later feast. And after this there were two more passo<a id="l23"></a>vers mentioned by Iohn ch 6.4. &amp; 12.1. And between the second &amp; third of these four <a id="l24"></a>passovers there was a passover  a month before the second chief  sabbat <a id="l25"></a> when the disciples pluckt &amp; eat the  ears of corn Mat. 12.1. <a id="l26"></a> For by the ripeness of the corn   you may know that this second chief sabbath was the second Passover or passover of <a id="l27"></a>the second month (Num. IX.11.) the first fruits of the corn being always offered in the  first Passover</p>
     <p id="par2"> Christ began not to preach till after the imprisonment of Iohn Mat. 4.12, 17. <a id="l28"></a>After that he went about all Galile teaching in their synagogues &amp; healing all  <a id="l29"></a>manner of diseases: This was in the first four months till the second passover &amp; longer. <a id="l30"></a>For <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span> his fame went through all Syria &amp; there followed him great multitudes from Galilee &amp; <a id="l31"></a>from Decapolis &amp; from Ierusalem &amp; from Iudea,  By the multitudes which followed him from Ieursalem &amp; Iudea you may <a id="l33"></a>know that he was now returned from the second passover.  All this was before his <a id="l34"></a>sermon in the mount. And  this <a id="l35"></a>sermon was in spring when the grass &amp; lillies of the field were in their <a id="l36"></a>beauty Matt VI.28, 30. And sometime after this there arose a great tempest in <a id="l37"></a>the sea Matt VIII.24. which was an argument of winter. And after this Iesus went <a id="l38"></a>about all the cities &amp; villages teaching in the synagogues untill the time of <a id="l39"></a>harvest approached Mat. IX.35, 37. The harvest was always between the  Passover &amp; Pentecost. Then he sent the twelve to preach in all the <a id="l40"></a>cities  &amp; villages. (Matt. 10.1) which travelling is an argument that  <a id="l41"></a>it was in  the summers half year &amp; that they   <a id="l42"></a>had already kept the feast of the Passover For he would scarce send them away to preach all of Iudea before they <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 17 characters)">{illeg}</span> had kept  this solemnity And Then followed the second chief<span class="gap" title="Illegible text (Extent: 3 characters)">{illeg}</span> <a id="l43"></a>sabbath when the disciples pluct &amp; eat the ripe ears of corn. Matt. XII.1.  And from all these things <a id="l44"></a> I gather that the preceding Passover in which the first fruits  of the corn were offered could <a id="l45"></a>not be sooner then the third Passover. It was therefore the third. And after this there were two more.</p>
     <p id="par3">For After this Passover &amp; the mission of the twelve Iohn hearing of the fame of Iesus sent to him two <a id="l46"></a>of his disciples &amp; therefore was still in prison. Mat XI.2.  ‡</p>
      <span class="pagenumber"> &lt; insertion from the middle of f 1v &gt; </span>

He died therefore in November two years &amp; a month be<a id="l117"></a>fore the vulgar Æra began  And Christ might be <a id="l122"></a>born  a few months before his death: for the children slain in Beth<a id="l123"></a>lehem were <sup>c</sup> under two-yearlings, that is not yet  entred <a id="l124"></a>upon their second year; &amp; the wise men came from the east <a id="l125"></a>while Ioseph &amp; Mary lodged  in the Inn with the new born babe <a id="l126"></a>&amp; by this recconing Christ might be baptized in the end of the <a id="l127"></a>15<sup>th</sup> or beginning of the 16<sup>th</sup> year of Tiberius before he <a id="l128"></a>was 31 years old. But if he was born earlier he will be above 31 years old at his <a id="l129"></a>baptism.</p> 
      <p id="par12">If from  his baptism there be recconed four Passovers to his passion <a id="l130"></a>his death will fall upon the year of the vulgar Æra 33. But its more <a id="l131"></a>probable that there were five. The first while Iohn was still <a id="l132"></a>baptizing,  Iohn 2.13. The second four months after Iohn's <a id="l133"></a>imprisonment. For Christ staid in Iudea baptizing till the impri<a id="l134"></a>sonment of Iohn &amp; then went into Galilee four months before <a id="l135"></a>the harvest, Iohn 4.35, &amp; by consequence four months before the Passover. For that harvest was always between the Passover &amp; Pentecost. And after this there was a feast of <a id="l136"></a>the Iews &amp; Iesus went up to Ierusalem Iohn 5.1.  <a id="l137"></a>This feast being after imprisonment of Iohn &amp; by consequence after the feast of Tabernacles was either the second Passover or a later feast. And <a id="l138"></a>after this there were two more Passovers mentioned by Iohn chap. <a id="l139"></a>6.4. &amp; 12.1. And between the second &amp; third of these four Passo<a id="l140"></a>vers there was a  fift Passover a week or perhaps a month before the second <a id="l141"></a>chief Sabbath when the disciples pluckt &amp; eat the ripe ears of <a id="l142"></a>corn. Matt. 12.1. Luke 6.1. For because the corn was then ripe, I understand by the second chief sabbath  <a id="l143"></a>either the 22<sup>th</sup> of Nisan or the secondary Passover or Passover of the second month (Num. 9.11). <a id="l144"></a>In the first  Passover they offered the first fruits of the corn <a id="l145"></a>before the harvest began: in the second the corn was ripe. </p>
     <p id="par13">Christ began not to preach  <a id="l146"></a>till after the imprisonment of Iohn Matt. 4.12, 17. After that he <a id="l147"></a>went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues &amp; healing all <a id="l148"></a>manner of diseases. And his fame went through all Syria &amp; there <a id="l149"></a>followed him great multitudes from Galilee &amp; from Decapolis &amp; <a id="l150"></a>from Ierusalem &amp; from Iudea Matt. 4.23, 24, 25.. All this  required above four months &amp; therefore the second <a id="l152"></a>passover was now past: for by the multitudes which followed  him from <a id="l153"></a>Ierusalem &amp; from Iudæa you may know that he  was returned <a id="l154"></a>from the second Passover. After all this he preached his sermon in <a id="l155"></a>the mount, &amp; this was in Spring suppose in the  third  or fourth month when the grass &amp; lillies of the field <a id="l156"></a>were in their beauty  ready to be set down Mat. 6.28, 30.   After many other things  there arose a <a id="l158"></a>great tempest in the sea (Mat. 8.24.) which is an argument that the next <a id="l159"></a> winter was now arrived. And after this, Iesus went about all the cities teaching <a id="l160"></a>in the synagogues untill the time of the harvest ( &amp; by conse<a id="l161"></a>quence  the third Passover ) approached Matt. 9.35, 37.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002v"> &lt;2v&gt; </span>  And After this Passover <a id="l162"></a>he sent the twelve to preach in the cities &amp; villages, the summer <a id="l163"></a>half year being fittest for travelling Matt. 10.1.

     <p id="par14">Hitherto Iohn remained in prison: for at this time upon hearing of the <a id="l166"></a>fame of Iesus he sent to him two of his disciples.

Then  Herod &amp; some of  the people hearing of his fame said, it is Iohn the <a id="l170"></a>baptist who is risen from the dead Matt. 14.1, 2, 10, 12. Mark 6.<a id="l171"></a>14, 29, 30. Luke 9.6, 7, 10.  This rumor was in the end of winter <a id="l172"></a>after the third Passover. For  when some of Iohn's disciples had buried his <a id="l175"></a>body &amp; came &amp; told Iesus he departed into a desart place <a id="l176"></a>perhaps fearing to be apprehended by Herod. And not long <a id="l177"></a>after, when the people heard where he was &amp; followed <a id="l178"></a>him thither out of the cities he fed them there with five <a id="l179"></a>loaves &amp; two little fishes, &amp; walked on the sea Matt. 14.<a id="l180"></a>12, 13, 17, 25. Iohn 6.9, 19. And this was  <a id="l181"></a>a little before the Passover (Iohn 6.4.) which was therefore <a id="l182"></a>the fourth Passover. And after his going up to Ierusalem <a id="l183"></a>to this feast he sent the seventy to preach in the cities <a id="l184"></a>Luke 9.51, 52, 57. &amp; 10.1. &amp; afterwards went to the feast <a id="l185"></a>of Tabernacles (Iohn 7.2.) &amp; was crucified in the Passover <a id="l186"></a>following.</p>
      <p id="par15">He began to preach eight or nine months after the <a id="l187"></a>first Passover &amp; four months before the second. In the first year of his preaching he called <a id="l188"></a>his disciples &amp; instructed them. In the summer of the second <a id="l189"></a>year he sent twelve of them to go through the cities &amp; villages <a id="l190"></a>of Iudea &amp; teach the people.

     <p id="par24">After the Phenicians began to frequent the Mediterranean <a id="l308"></a>&amp; trade to Greece  the Greeks also began to use the seas &amp;  send colonies abroad &amp; had frequent transactions <a id="l309"></a> with the nations of Phenicia &amp; Egypt whereby they became civilized in a short time &amp; arts began to flourish among them. And And first <a id="l310"></a>the Phœnician Merchants stole away Io the daughter of Inachus &amp; <a id="l311"></a>carried her into Egypt. Then the merchants of Crete in revenge <a id="l312"></a>stole away Europa the daughter of Agenor a Phenician king <a id="l313"></a>&amp; of her Arterius king of Crete  begat Minos Rhadamanthus <a id="l314"></a>&amp; Sarpedon. At the same  time Cadmus being sent by father Agenor  to seek his sister Europa <a id="l316"></a>brought letters into Greece &amp; Evander with his mother Carmenta <a id="l317"></a>soon after carried them to Italy, &amp; this gave a beginning <a id="l318"></a>to learning &amp; history in Europe. For before this time  <a id="l319"></a> the Europeans for want of letters  had  <a id="l320"></a>nothing more of history then the names of a few kings in <a id="l321"></a>Greece  3 or 4 Generations backwards, which they were able <a id="l322"></a>to remember till Cadmus taught them to commit things to <a id="l323"></a>writing.  About the same <a id="l324"></a>time Cecrops  brought a colony from Egypt into Attica <a id="l325"></a> &amp; built Athens &amp; Erectheus followed him with  a great <a id="l326"></a>quantity of corn brought out of Egypt &amp; sowed in Parea &amp; Ceres an Egyptian <a id="l327"></a>woman &amp; her son Triptolemus taught the Greeks  how to sow . In <a id="l328"></a>those days the Greek seas became much infested with Pyrates <a id="l329"></a>till Minos built a navy &amp; suppressed them. About that time Sesac <a id="l330"></a>built long ships of larger size then formerly in the red sea &amp; Mediterranean &amp; his brother <a id="l331"></a>Danaus sailed to Greece in one of them : in imitation of which the <a id="l332"></a>Greeks built the ship Argo which was the first long ship built <a id="l333"></a>by the Greeks. Then also Dædalus invented sails for ships, so that <a id="l334"></a>navigation in a short time became very much improved.  And <a id="l335"></a>These are the first antiquities of  Europe of which we have any certain <a id="l336"></a>memory.</p>
     
     <p id="par26">Before the invasion of Greece by the kings of Persia the Greeks <a id="l338"></a>kept no certain account of time.

And this changing of names &amp; calling several dead men by the same new name &amp; the same dead man by several new names <a id="l819"></a>has very much clouded the history of the ages of the <a id="l820"></a>Gods.</p>
     <p id="par72">When Bacchus invaded Greece he was entertained by <a id="l821"></a>Amphictyon the son of Deucalion, &amp; in memory thereof <a id="l822"></a>there were set up at Athens in a cell consecrated to <a id="l823"></a>Bacchus, many earthen statues &amp; amongst them the <a id="l824"></a>statue of Amphictyon enterteining Bacchus &amp; the <a id="l825"></a>Gods, &amp; also the statue of Pegasus of Eleutheris who <a id="l826"></a>first introduced the worship of Bacchus amongst the <a id="l827"></a>Athenians. This was that Amphictyon who by the ad<a id="l828"></a>vice of Acrisius erected the Amphictyonic Council <a id="l829"></a>appointing it to meet every spring &amp; autumn at Delphos <a id="l830"></a>in the temple of Apollo &amp; at Thermopylæ in the <a id="l831"></a>temple of Ceres. They tell us that when the rain fell which <a id="l832"></a>overflowed the kingdom of Deucalion in Thessaly &amp; Lycorea, he fled <a id="l833"></a>from the rain to Athens &amp; in memory of his escape built <a id="l834"></a>there a Temple to Iupiter Phyxius. This cannot be understood <a id="l835"></a>literally without a miracle. For Athens was lower then <a id="l836"></a>Thessaly &amp; Lycorea, &amp; no man without a divine admonition <a id="l837"></a>would fly from rain before he was in danger by the rising <a id="l838"></a>of the waters, &amp; then the waters would hinder his flight. <a id="l839"></a>Iupiter Phyxius signifies the Iupiter of them that  escape <a id="l840"></a>by flying. So the Scholiast of Pindar <sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup> tells us that when Phryxus <a id="l841"></a>fled from his stepmother &amp;  escaped to Colchos he consecrated <a id="l842"></a>the fleece to Iupiter Phyxius. When Sesostris invaded &amp; over<a id="l843"></a>flowed Thessaly, Deucalion fled with his son Amphictyon <a id="l844"></a>to Athens &amp; there they made their peace with Bacchus. <a id="l845"></a>For there Amphictyon enterteined Bacchus &amp; his great men <a id="l846"></a>  &amp; erected an altar to him, &amp;   instituted <a id="l847"></a>an annual festival to Iupiter Phyxius which was long observed. And <a id="l848"></a>by these &amp; such like practises the worship of the  Dij magni ma<a id="l849"></a>jorum gentium was set on foot in Greece.</p>

A mouse was the <a id="l911"></a>Egyptian symbol of destruction, &amp; the mouse in the hand of Sethom signifies <a id="l912"></a>only that he overcame the Assyrians with a great destruction.

     <p id="par88">In this first Dynasty the Oriental historians reccon eleven successive <a id="l1055"></a>kings. And these kings at about 18 or 20 years to a reign will take <a id="l1056"></a>up about 200  years &amp; thereby place the beginning of <a id="l1057"></a>this Dynasty about 20  years before the Olympiads, that <a id="l1058"></a>is,  about the time that the oriental nations revolted from Egypt, or soon after. <a id="l1059"></a>And yet the Oriental historians make this Dynasty much ancienter. For <a id="l1060"></a>they tells us that some of the Pischdadian kings  lived a <a id="l1061"></a>thousand years a piece &amp; that they reigned all together above <a id="l1062"></a>three thousand years. And to the first king of the second Dynasty <a id="l1063"></a>they assigne a reign of 120, to the second a reign of 150 <a id="l1064"></a>years, to the third a reign of 60 years to the 4<sup>th</sup> a reign of <a id="l1065"></a>120 years, to the fift as much, &amp; to the sixt called Artaxer<a id="l1066"></a>xes Longimanus a reign of 112 years. So then we need not won<a id="l1067"></a>der that the Egyptians have made the kings in the first Dynasty <a id="l1068"></a>of their Monarchy (that which was seated at Thebes in the first days of <a id="l1069"></a>David Solomon &amp; Rehoboam) so very ancient &amp; so long lived, since <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017r"> &lt;17r&gt; </span> the Persians have done the like to the kings who began to reigne in Persia <a id="l1070"></a> two hundred years after the death of  Solomon making them older then Adam.</p>
     <p id="par89">The oriental historians tell us also that in those days the <a id="l1071"></a>Scythians on the north side of the river Oxus which runs westward <a id="l1072"></a>into the Caspian sea having erected there a potent kingdom called the <a id="l1073"></a>kingdom of Touran or Turquestan, invaded Persia frequently in the reign <a id="l1074"></a>of one of their kings called Afrasiab; &amp; that in the reign of the <a id="l1075"></a>eighth king of the Pischadadians, Afrasiab conquered Persia &amp; reigned <a id="l1076"></a>over it twelve years together, &amp; then was repulsed by the tenth <a id="l1077"></a>King of the Pischadadians, &amp; invaded it again in the reign of the <a id="l1078"></a>eleventh &amp; last king of the Pischadadians called Kischtasp the son of Zab; &amp; was <a id="l1079"></a>at length slain in the mountains of Media by the third king <a id="l1080"></a>of the second Dynasty. Whence its probable that the three first <a id="l1081"></a>kings of the second Dynasty were contemporary to the three or <a id="l1082"></a>four last of the first Dynasty, &amp; that the Scythians whom Cyaxe<a id="l1083"></a>res slew in a feast in the latter end of his fathers reign or beginning of his own were <a id="l1084"></a>Afrasiab  and his captains or some of them.</p>
     <p id="par90">The Persians in their histories have no memory of the wars <a id="l1085"></a>of Sesac or of the dominion of Egypt over Persia, or of any <a id="l1086"></a>thing ancienter in Persia then the Dynasty of the Pischadadians. <a id="l1087"></a> They begin their history with that Dynasty as the Ethiopians do theirs with the Dynasty of their Gods &amp; make it  older then  Adam tho it was not much older then the Olympiads. So then the first great Empire in the world on this side India was that of Egypt founded by Ammon &amp; Sesac &amp; this Empire lost some Provinces upon the Euxine &amp; Mediterranean seas about the time of the Argonautic expedition, but kept its dominion over Chaldea, Elam, Assyria, Armenia &amp; Cappadocia till the reign of Mæris or his successor Sephis. And then those nations becoming free set up the king<a id="l1091"></a>doms of Elam Assyria Babylon &amp; Media. And these are the first great Empires in the world on this side India. Great Empires &amp;c Great <a id="l1092"></a>empires are always accompanied with great imperial cities, &amp; the first <a id="l1093"></a>city which reigned over all Egypt was Thebes, the first which reigned <a id="l1094"></a>over all Phœnicia between Egypt &amp; Euphrates was Ierusalem, the first <a id="l1095"></a>which reigned over all Assyria was Nineveh, the first which reigned over <a id="l1096"></a>all Chaldea was Babylo<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>n,<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the first which reigned over all Media was <a id="l1097"></a> Ecoatane, the first which reigned over the gr<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>eates<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>t part of Asia minor was Sardes, the first which reigned over all Greece was Macedon, &amp; the <a id="l1098"></a>first which reigned over all  Italy was Rome. Persepolis was the <a id="l1099"></a>capital of the Medo-Persian Empire, &amp; Darius Hystaspis built it out of <a id="l1100"></a>the spoiles carried from Egypt by Cambyses. These great Empires <a id="l1101"></a>arose out of smaller kingdoms by conquest &amp; were the first that did <a id="l1102"></a>so; &amp; those kingdoms arose out of others still smaller, &amp; those out of <a id="l1103"></a>single cities each of which at first had its own king, &amp; those out of small <a id="l1104"></a>single cities each of which at first had its own king, &amp; those out of small <a id="l1105"></a>villages built by mankind upon the first peopling of the earth, &amp; those <a id="l1106"></a>began not to be built in Europe before the days of Eli &amp; Samuel.</p>
     <p id="par91">Herodotus tells us that all Media was peopled by δήμοι towns without <a id="l1107"></a>walls  till they revolted from the Assyrians &amp; that after that revolt <a id="l1108"></a>they  set up a king <a id="l1109"></a>over them &amp; built Ecbatane which walls for his seat, the first town which <a id="l1110"></a>they walled about. And it will be difficult to name a town in all <a id="l1111"></a>Europe which was built with walls before the warrs of Sesostris. The <a id="l1112"></a>antiquities of Libya were not much older then those of Europe <a id="l1113"></a>for Diodorus tells us that the Libyans had a tradition that Vranus <a id="l1114"></a>the father of Hyperion &amp; grandfather of Helius &amp; Selene (that is, Ammon <a id="l1115"></a>the father of Sesac) was their first king &amp; caused the people who then <a id="l1116"></a>wandered up &amp; down, to dwell in towns &amp; cities, &amp; reducing them from <a id="l1117"></a>a lawless &amp; savage course of life taught them to  use &amp; lay <a id="l1118"></a>up the fruits of the earth, &amp; do many other things usefull for mans <a id="l1119"></a>life. When Ioshua conquered the land of Canaan, every city of the <a id="l1120"></a>Canaanites had its own king like the cities of Europe before they  conquered one another : which is an argument that towns began to be built in  that land not <a id="l1122"></a>many ages before the days of Ioshua. For the Patriarchs wandred there <a id="l1123"></a>in tents &amp; fed their flocks wherever they pleased, the field of Phenicia <a id="l1124"></a>not being yet appropriated for want of people. The countries first inhabited by <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017v"> &lt;17v&gt; </span> mankind were in those days so thinly peopled that four kings from <a id="l1125"></a>the coasts of Shinar &amp; Elam, invaded &amp; spoiled the Rephaims &amp; the <a id="l1126"></a>inhabitants of the countries of Moab Ammon Edom Amalec &amp; the <a id="l1127"></a>kingdoms of Sodom Gomorrah Admah &amp; Zeboim &amp; yet were pursued <a id="l1128"></a>&amp; beaten by Abraham with an armed force of only 318 men <a id="l1129"></a>the whole force which Abraham &amp; the Princes confederate with him <a id="l1130"></a>could raise. And Egypt was so thinly peopled before the birth of <a id="l1131"></a>Moses that  Pharaoh said of the Israelites; Behold the people <a id="l1132"></a> of the children of Israel are more &amp; mightier then we; &amp; <a id="l1133"></a>to prevent their multiplying &amp; growing too strong, caused their <a id="l1134"></a>male children to be drowned. These footsteps there are of the <a id="l1135"></a>first peopling of the earth by mankind not long before the days <a id="l1136"></a>of Abraham &amp; of the overspreading it with villages towns &amp; <a id="l1137"></a>cities &amp; their growing into kingdoms first smaller &amp; then greater <a id="l1138"></a>untill the rise of the Monarchies of Egypt, Elam, Assyria, Babylon <a id="l1139"></a>Media &amp; Persia, Greece &amp; Rome, the first great Empires on this <a id="l1140"></a>side India.</p>

For the beginning of his kingdom was Babel &amp; <a id="l1378"></a>Erech &amp; Accad &amp; Calneh in the land of Shinar.  And Elam  fled from him &amp; seated <a id="l1380"></a>himself on the next river Choaspis  giving the name of Vlay to the river &amp; Elymais to the region &amp; leaving Babylonia to be peopled by Nimrod: Whence Babylonia is called the land of Nimrod Micha 9. <a id="l1381"></a>And This was done soon after the division of the earth because Nimrod was two gene<a id="l1382"></a>rations older then Peleg in whose days the earth was divided.  Afterwards Nimrod being <a id="l1383"></a>not yet content with his seat went out thence to  invade Assyria &amp; then built <a id="l1384"></a>Nineveh &amp; Rehoboth &amp; Calah the metropolis of Calachene &amp; Resen (le<span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> Resen <a id="l1385"></a>Larissam) between Nineveh &amp; Calah.  But it being the custome in those days for <a id="l1386"></a>every father to divide his territory between all his sons:  it is to be conceived that <a id="l1387"></a>Nimrod  divided his territory &amp; cities between his sons &amp; they theirs between their sons  <a id="l1388"></a>&amp; so on till every city had its king. .  And thence it is that we hear nothing more of the kingdome founded by Nimrod For I shall <a id="l1391"></a>shew presently that the Assyrian Empire so much established in history <a id="l1392"></a>grew up by conquest out of many small kingdoms long after the days of <a id="l1393"></a>Nimrod. Yet Nimrod by  reason of the greatness of his conquests &amp; dominion being called the Lord, which in the Chaldean language is Belus, seems to have retained that name after death amongst his subjects, &amp; to have been the first king whom they worshipped by that name. For idolatry began soon after <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 23r &gt; </span>his death amongst the Chaldees.

     <p id="par118">And as Nimrod invaded  Babylonia &amp; Assyria so other wars <a id="l1394"></a>arising frequently between the  kings of cities or countries  <a id="l1395"></a>about their possessions put things frequently into disorder  as in the case of the five kings invading Arabia Petræa &amp; the southern <a id="l1397"></a>parts of Canaan in the days of Abraham. And this made it necessary <a id="l1398"></a>for those  of a Tribe or neighbourhood to consult together for their <a id="l1399"></a>common safety &amp; chuse out wise &amp; valiant men to lead their <a id="l1400"></a>armies against their enemies &amp; fortify places with walls within which <a id="l1401"></a>should be many houses for the people to resort unto out of the fields <a id="l1402"></a>&amp; villages in time of danger.

And <a id="l1414"></a>about the same time that the Israelites peopled this country the <a id="l1415"></a>Horites peopled mount Seir. For Seir the  Horite or Son <a id="l1416"></a>of Hori placed his sons  Lotan  Shobal Zibeon Anah <a id="l1417"></a>Dishon Ezer Dishan,  in this mount. And these were Dukes <a id="l1418"></a>  of Seir, or heads of families  &amp; founding of cities,  &amp; Timnah their sister was Esau's concubine, &amp; <a id="l1419"></a>Aholibamah the daughter of Anah was his wife. And in the <a id="l1420"></a>next generation,  Esau seated his sons the Dukes of Edom in <a id="l1421"></a>the same mount, &amp; they in time expelled the Horites.  And after the same manner it may be conceived that the <a id="l1425"></a>lands of Moab &amp; Ammon were peopled first by the Emims &amp; Zuzims &amp; then by the <a id="l1426"></a>  Moabites &amp; Ammonites in the days of Abraham  Isaac &amp; <a id="l1427"></a>Iacob. And even in that fertil country the lower Egypt they <a id="l1428"></a>continued building new cities till Abrahams days For Tsoan or <a id="l1429"></a>Tanis a royall city thereof was built seven years after Hebron <a id="l1430"></a>And Hebron was founded in Abrahams days being first called Mamre  from Mamre the Amorite the brother of Eshcol the brother <a id="l1432"></a>of Aner who were contemporary to Abraham, then Kirjath Arba <a id="l1433"></a>from Arba the father of Anak &amp; lastly Hebron by the Israelites when <a id="l1434"></a>they took it from  Sheshai Ahiman &amp; Tolmai <a id="l1435"></a>the three sons of Anak in the days of Ioshua.</p>

     <p id="par143">The kings which reigned henceforward at Nineveh <a id="l1521"></a>were Phul, Tiglath Phulassar, Palmanassar, Señacherib, <a id="l1522"></a>&amp; Assarhaddon Assar-haddon-phul or Sardanapalus.. Phul invaded Israel in the reign of Me<a id="l1523"></a>nahen king of Israel but was bought off. In the reign of Tiglath Phulassar <a id="l1524"></a> the Kingdom &amp; City of Babylon was founded by Assyrians <a id="l1525"></a>under the conduct of Nabonassar, &amp; thereby the Assyrian <a id="l1526"></a>Monarchy became divided into two kingdoms, the one reigning <a id="l1527"></a>at Nineve the other at Babylon. Whether this  division was <a id="l1528"></a> made by a revolt or by the last will &amp; testament of Phul <a id="l1529"></a>or  otherwise by the consent of T. Phulassar, is not said in history. One of the two latter is  is more probable because <a id="l1530"></a> Tiglath Philasar was potent enough to have made <a id="l1531"></a>war upon Nabonassar &amp; yet bent his forces another way. <a id="l1532"></a>For about this time he  warred  &amp; in Phœnicia <a id="l1533"></a>captivated Galile with the two Tribes &amp; an half &amp; placed them in Chalah &amp; Chabor Chara &amp; to the river of Ssozan, places lying in the <a id="l1534"></a>western border <a id="l1535"></a>of Media be<a id="l1536"></a>tween Assyria <a id="l1537"></a>&amp; the Caspian <a id="l1538"></a>sea.

But whether he or the Medes had the <a id="l1616"></a>Province   or whether they parted it between <a id="l1617"></a>them  However this is certain that by the building <a id="l1618"></a>of Babylon &amp; fall of Nineveh the kingdom of the Assyrians <a id="l1619"></a> did not cease but was only translated to a new seat,  Herodotus who ascribes the subversion of  Nineve to the Medes  alone reccons that they subdued Media. But Nebuchadnezzar &amp; the Medes joyned &amp;c may be disputed, but whilst Assyria belonged originally to the same kingdom with Babylon its most probable that the Medes conceded in this to the Babylonians &amp; were requited by something else. However this is certain that by  the  building <a id="l1623"></a>.for these reasons</p> 
     <p id="par145">First because the Kingdom &amp; city of of Babylon was founded by <a id="l1624"></a>Assyrians. <em class="underline">Behold,  saith Isaiah<sup class="note" id="n51-ref">[51]</sup>, the land of the Chaldeans <a id="l1626"></a>this people was not till the Assyrian founded it for <a id="l1627"></a>them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the <a id="l1628"></a>towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof</em>.</p>
     <p id="par146">Secondly because the Kings of Babylon were all of <a id="l1629"></a>them Assyrians till the reign of Darius the Mede. For <a id="l1630"></a>Ptolomy to his Canon of all the Kings of Babylon which <a id="l1631"></a>preceded Cyrus prefixes this title <em class="underline">Canon regum Assy<a id="l1632"></a>riorum &amp; Medorum</em>.  This appears also by <a id="l1633"></a>  the names of the <a id="l1634"></a> Babylonian Kings &amp; Nobles compounded of Assyr,  such as are nabon-assar, <a id="l1635"></a>Nabo-phul-assar, Nabu-chadon-assar, Nabu-assar-hadon, <a id="l1636"></a>Beltes-assar, Bels-assar, Nergal-assar, Shesheb-assar, <a id="l1637"></a>For so were the Assyrian names often compounded as <a id="l1638"></a>in these instances, Tiglat-phul-assar, Assar-haon <a id="l1639"></a>Salman-assar, Shar-assar.  Where note that <em class="underline">chadon<a id="l1640"></a>hadon</em> or <em class="underline">adon</em> signifies <em class="underline">Dominus</em>.</p>
     <p id="par147">Thirdly the people of  Babylonia &amp; Assyria <a id="l1641"></a>were of the same stock, their common father being Nimrod. <a id="l1642"></a>For he reigned first in  Shinar &amp; then in Assyria.</p>
     <p id="par148">Fourthly  the dominions of Babylon &amp;  Nineve were the very same  excepting that Babylon <a id="l1643"></a>reigned over Moab &amp; Ammon &amp; Edon &amp; perhaps not over <a id="l1644"></a>all Assyria.</p>
     <p id="par149"> Lastly the ancients used to reccon the kingdom of <a id="l1645"></a>Babylon  one of the two branches of the Assyrian Monarchy. So  :<sup><em>b</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> <a id="l1646"></a> <sup><em>b</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n54-ref">[54]</sup> Strabo <em class="underline">Assyrij Babylone ac Nini regiam ha<a id="l1648"></a>buerunt</em>. &amp; <sup><em>c</em></sup><sup class="note" id="n55-ref">[55]</sup> Herodotus: <em class="underline">Sola Assyriorum regia fuit babylon <a id="l1649"></a>post eversam Ninum</em>. And again:  Medi <em class="underline">et Ninum ex <a id="l1650"></a>pugnaverunt et Assyrios subegerunt excepta portione <a id="l1651"></a>Babylonica</em>. And hence it is that the Greeks &amp; Latins in recconing <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027v"> &lt;027v&gt; </span> up all the great Monarchies, never reccon the Babylo<a id="l1652"></a>nian Monarchy distinct from the of the Assyrians but in<a id="l1653"></a>clude it therein. For they reccon the Assyrian Monarchy <a id="l1654"></a>the first,  that of the Medes the second  that of the <a id="l1655"></a>Persians the third &amp; that of the Greeks &amp; Latins the <a id="l1656"></a>fourth &amp; fift.</p>

     <p id="par151">The first Monarchy of great extent is gene<a id="l1659"></a>rally recconed the Assyrian seated at Nineve. It stood <a id="l1660"></a> according to Herodotus 520 years untill the defection of the Medes &amp;   <a id="l1661"></a> about an hundred years more untill Nebuchadnezzar &amp; Cyaxerxes overthrew it <a id="l1662"></a>&amp; so began about 150 years before the reign of Saul. But we are not <a id="l1663"></a> to reccon the it stood all that time in its greatness. <a id="l1664"></a>The cities of Rome,  Sardes,  Athens, Corinth, <a id="l1665"></a>Tyre &amp; others kept long registers of their kings while <a id="l1666"></a>their dominions were but small, &amp; the like it is to be <a id="l1667"></a>understood of Nineve.  During the time of the Iudges of <a id="l1668"></a>Israel  unlike after the reign of David  Syria &amp; Mesopota<a id="l1669"></a>mia were subject to  kings of other cities  (Iud. 3.8. 2 Sam. 8 &amp; 10) <a id="l1670"></a>&amp; therefore Nineve  had not yet extended it domini<a id="l1671"></a>on on this side Euphrates.  The first mention I meet <a id="l1675"></a>with of a king of Nineveh is in the prophesy of Ionah <a id="l1676"></a>who lived  about 230 years  before the fall of this <a id="l1677"></a>kingdom. And at that time the City was a very great <a id="l1678"></a>one of 3 days journey, but the greatness was rather in <a id="l1679"></a>extent of ground then multitude of people.  For it contein<a id="l1680"></a>ed not much above 120000 persons which could not discern between their right hand &amp; their left Ionah 4.11. Reccon these <a id="l1681"></a> to be infants under 2 years old &amp; that there were six times more peo<a id="l1682"></a>ple in the city &amp; the whole number of people will be but about 720000 <a id="l1683"></a>whereas in the Egyptian Thebes there were numbred 700000 persons fit for war.   <a id="l1684"></a> <a id="l1685"></a>kingdoms now in being.   <a id="l1686"></a>Whence we may reccon that the kingdom of Assyria was now grown a <a id="l1687"></a>considerable one but not yet arrived to its greatness. <a id="l1688"></a>About 60 years after  it began to spread into Syria: <a id="l1689"></a>&amp; from that time  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p028v"> &lt;028v&gt; </span> other nations who afterwards, as Herodotus tells us, fell off from it.</p>
     <p id="par152">The kingdom being now in its height began from <a id="l1701"></a>this time to decline by the defection of some of the <a id="l1702"></a>conquered nations.  And the first of the nations <a id="l1703"></a>who fell off the Medes.  They first asserted <a id="l1704"></a>their liberty without a king &amp; then   made Dejoces king over <a id="l1705"></a>them &amp; lived under four successive kings, Dejoces, Phraortes, Cyaxerxes <a id="l1706"></a>&amp; Astyages  for  150 years together till the <a id="l1707"></a>reign of Cyrus, &amp; by consequence fell off from the <a id="l1708"></a>Assyrian Monarchy in the reign of  Sennacherib <a id="l1709"></a>soon after the great  loss of his army  in  <a id="l1710"></a>Palestine by a sudden plague, 2 King. 19. For that loss happened 156 years before the <a id="l1711"></a>reign of Cyrus &amp; by reason of the subsequent defection of the Medes, Tobit <a id="l1712"></a>tells us that the reign of  reign of Sennacherib was troubled <a id="l1715"></a>so y<sup>t</sup> he could not go from Nineve into Media as he <a id="l1716"></a>had done before in the reign of Enemessar<sup class="note" id="n56-ref">[56]</sup> (so he calls <a id="l1717"></a>Salmanassar) the former king.   Dejoces the first <a id="l1718"></a>king  of the Medes founded Ecbatane reigned 53 years &amp; pro<a id="l1719"></a>pagated the kingdom westward into Armenia as far as the river Halys <a id="l1720"></a> the common bound of  his &amp; the Lydia king<a id="l1721"></a>doms.  Phraortes his son reigned 22 years <a id="l1722"></a>&amp; conquered the Persians &amp; made war also upon the kings <a id="l1723"></a>of Assyria but was overthrown by him in battel &amp; slain. <a id="l1724"></a>  Cyaxerxes the son of Phraortes thereupon prosecuting the <a id="l1725"></a>the war,  overcame the Assyrians in battel &amp; laid siege <a id="l1726"></a>to Nineve but was forced from the siege by a great <a id="l1727"></a>incursion of Scythians who overcame him in battel <a id="l1728"></a>&amp; reigned over his kingdom for 28 years together <a id="l1729"></a>but there Phraortes invited them to a feast made them drunk &amp; slew <a id="l1730"></a>them,  &amp; having thus recovered his kingdom <a id="l1731"></a>returned to the war against the  Assyrians &amp; by <a id="l1732"></a>the help of Nebuchadnezzar overthrew that king<a id="l1733"></a>dom.  In confirmation of all this you may see the very great slaughter of the  Assyrians &amp; <a id="l1734"></a>Scythians by Cyaxerxes &amp; of the Persians by Phraortes <a id="l1735"></a> described  in Ezekiel chap. 32.22, 24, 26.</p>

     <p id="par155" class="i0">&amp; compare them with the records of the Greeks. This I note <a id="l1737"></a>to shew the uncertainty of such  opinions about this monarchy as rest upon the <a id="l1738"></a>authority of the Iews:  of which kind are the opinions y<sup>t</sup> the <a id="l1739"></a>return of the captivity was in the 28<sup>th</sup> year of Cyrus, y<sup>t</sup> <a id="l1740"></a>Artaxerxes was the common name of all the kings of Persia, <a id="l1741"></a>&amp; that Sanballat lived in the time of Darius Codomannus <a id="l1742"></a>&amp; built the temple of the Samanites in mount Gerazim <a id="l1743"></a>in the very end of his reign when Alexander the great made wars upon him.</p>
     
     
     <p id="par158">The earth was at first divided into many small kingdoms <a id="l1770"></a>according to the number of cities. These by conquering one another  grew <a id="l1771"></a>greater &amp; greater till they arrived at the bigness  they are now at.</p>
     <p id="par159">The first Monarchy of great extent is accounted the Assyrian. <a id="l1772"></a>Its seat was Nineve  a city founded by Ninus or Nimrod who <a id="l1773"></a>was mighty in the earth. The beginning of his kingdom was <a id="l1774"></a>in the land of Sennarr &amp; thence he went into Assyria <a id="l1775"></a>&amp; built Nineve Gen. 10.  As Egypt is called the land of <a id="l1776"></a>Ham not because he peopled it (for so he did  Phœni<a id="l1777"></a>cia &amp; all Afric) but because  it was his <a id="l1778"></a>kingdom: so Assyria  is called the land of Nimrod because <a id="l1779"></a>it was his kingdom  Micha 5.6.</p>
     <p id="par160">Nineve was of old a very great city.   Ionah who lived <a id="l1780"></a>above an hundred years before the captivity of the 10 tribes (2 King. 14. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p029v"> &lt;029v&gt; </span>  tells us it was then a very  great city of three days journey   Strabo makes it  48 miles,  Diodorus  60 <a id="l1782"></a>miles about,  so y<sup>t</sup> it was much greater then Babylon. <a id="l1783"></a>By the greatness thereof even in Ionah's days  may be gathered that <a id="l1784"></a>it had been then the  metropolis of an ancient flourishing kingdom. <a id="l1785"></a> And yet if it conteined not  much above 12000 people (Ionah 4.11.) it was <a id="l1786"></a>only great in extent of ground &amp; fell much short of Paris &amp; London in number of people  &amp; others</p>
     <p id="par161">If the race of kings borrowed by Eusebius from the fabulous writings <a id="l1787"></a>of Ctesias be rejected, we have little or nothing certain of this kingdom <a id="l1788"></a>before the reign of Phul. Till then it seems to have been kept within <a id="l1789"></a>the bounds of Assyria: for Syria &amp; Mesopotamia had kings of <a id="l1790"></a>their own (Iud. 38. 2 Sam. 8 &amp; 10.) Phul was  the first king <a id="l1791"></a>of Assyria who is read to have made war  on this side <a id="l1792"></a> Euphrates  (2 King. 15.19.)  This was about 40 or 50 <a id="l1793"></a>years before the captivity of the 10 tribes.  Soon after Tiglath <a id="l1794"></a>Peleser  ruined  the Kingdom of Syria &amp; captivated it <a id="l1795"></a>with the two tribes &amp; an half (2 King. 16.9. 1 Chron. 5.26.) &amp; after<a id="l1796"></a>wards  Shalmanesser captivated all the rest of Isra<a id="l1797"></a>el. And as this kingdom was propagated  now as far westward <a id="l1798"></a>as to the Mediterranean so  no doubt it was propagated <a id="l1799"></a>at the same time into other quarters  . For the Medes <a id="l1800"></a>were now become subject to the Assyrians (2 King. 17.6. Tobit 1.13, 14.)</p>
     <p id="par162">Out of this kingdom thus grown great were two others <a id="l1801"></a>split: that of Babylon &amp; that of the Medes. First Nabo<a id="l1802"></a>nassar an Assyrian founded both the  Kingdom &amp;  City of Babylon &amp; peopled it with <a id="l1803"></a>the  Arabians collected thither into a body from <a id="l1804"></a>the neighbouring regions (Isa. 23.13.) These Arabians seem <a id="l1805"></a>to be of the posterity of Chavilah the son of Chus. For <a id="l1806"></a>Chus after he had lived some time in Egypt with his <a id="l1807"></a>Father Ham, went thence into the east &amp; placed his sons <a id="l1808"></a>round the Persian gulf from the  furthest  part of  <a id="l1809"></a>Arabia felix to the furthest part of Persia, &amp; the lot of <a id="l1810"></a>Chavilah was between the Persian gulf,  Babylon &amp; the country of Amaleck lying in the <a id="l1811"></a>way from Egypt to Assyria (Gen. 2.11, &amp; 25.18. 1 Sam. 15.7.) <a id="l1812"></a>These Arabians the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n58-ref">[58]</sup> Greeks &amp; Latins called Chaulotæans <a id="l1813"></a>whence  came the name of Chaldæans to those in Baby<a id="l1814"></a>lon.</p>
     <p id="par163">The  Chaldeans dated all their years from the  first <a id="l1815"></a>year of the reign of their founder Nabonassar which year was 747 years before the <a id="l1816"></a> birth of Christ according to the vulgar account<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l1817"></a>And these years consisted always of 365 days without any leap year &amp; in the time of <a id="l1818"></a>the Babylonian  &amp; Persian Monarchies began in winter.</p>
     <p id="par164"> At length by the fall of the Assyrian Monarchy <a id="l1819"></a>the  Kingdoms of Babylonia &amp; Media grew great. For till <a id="l1820"></a>then the Kingdom of Babylon seems to have comprehended <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030r"> &lt;030r&gt; </span> nothing more then the Provinces of Babylon &amp; Susa.  <a id="l1821"></a> but when    this kingdom fell <a id="l1824"></a>Nebuchadnezzar invaded Syria Phœnicia &amp; Mesopotamia which had <a id="l1825"></a>hitherto belonged to the   Assyrians  by  upon their <a id="l1826"></a>fall were  seized  by the King of Egypt. But for understanding these <a id="l1827"></a>things its requisite to connect the chronology of  the king<a id="l1828"></a>dom of Babylon with that of the kingdom of Iudah.</p>

     <p id="par167">Before all this, Paraoh Necho in passing through <a id="l1830"></a>Iudea to make war upon the king of Assyria &amp;  beseige <a id="l1831"></a> Carchemish or Cerusium a town of Mesopotamia <a id="l1832"></a> upon Euphrates, slew Iosiah King of Iudah who opposed him <a id="l1833"></a>&amp; three months after where he had beaten the Assyrians <a id="l1834"></a>&amp; taken Carchemish &amp; was returned  into the land of Hamath or Antioch, sent &amp; captivated Iehoabaz the successor of <a id="l1835"></a>Iosiah &amp; made Iehojakim king in his stead &amp; put the land <a id="l1836"></a>to tribute (2 King. 23. 2 Chron. 35.:) whence Iehojakim, be<a id="l1837"></a>gan his reign  towards the end of summer in the <a id="l1838"></a>37<sup>th</sup> year of Nabonassar. For he reigned 11 years <a id="l1839"></a>incomplete, &amp; his 4<sup>th</sup> year fell in with the first <a id="l1840"></a>of Nebuchadnezzar over Iudea (Ier. 25.1.) Thus Pharaoh <a id="l1841"></a>became Lord of what the King of Assyria had hitherto possest <a id="l1842"></a>on both sides Euphrates &amp; made  the King of Iudah also <a id="l1843"></a> his servant. I know some would  have the King of Assyria <a id="l1844"></a>against whom Pharaoh  now warred   to be the King of <a id="l1845"></a>Babylon as if there were now more kingdoms of Assyria then one. For:   its certain that the Kingdom of <a id="l1846"></a>Assyria was still in being &amp; at this time distinct from <a id="l1847"></a>that of Babylon.</p>
     <p id="par168">  </p>
     <p id="par169">This war of Pharaoh seems occasioned by a conspiracy <a id="l1848"></a>of the Kings of Media &amp; Babylon at the same time against <a id="l1849"></a>the Kings of Assyria.  For Ahasuerus or Cyaxerxes King <a id="l1850"></a>of the Medes  &amp; Nebuchadnezzar the son of the <a id="l1851"></a>king of Babylon now joyned together against the king of <a id="l1852"></a>Assyria overthrew his kingdom &amp; destroyed Nineve Tobit. 14.15.. And so great <a id="l1853"></a>was the fall of this kingdom that Ezekiel has thus described <a id="l1854"></a>it. Thus saith the Lord God, in the day when he went down <a id="l1855"></a>to the grave, I caused a mourning, – I  caused Lebanon &amp; <a id="l1856"></a> to mourn for him, &amp; all the trees of the field <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030v"> &lt;030v&gt; </span> <em class="underline">fainted for him. I made the nations to shake at the sound <a id="l1857"></a>of his fall when I cast him down to hell with them <a id="l1858"></a>that descend into the pit</em> Ezek. 31.15.  The same Pro<a id="l1859"></a>phet describes at large how very great this kingdom was <a id="l1860"></a>before its fall &amp; how  at its fall the tributary  nations deserted him &amp; the neighbouring <a id="l1861"></a> kingdoms shared his provinces. <em class="underline">Strangers</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">&amp; the terribl<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l1862"></a>of the nations have cut him off &amp; have  cast him upon the <a id="l1863"></a>mountains, &amp; in all the valleys his branches are fallen, &amp; <a id="l1864"></a>his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land, &amp; <a id="l1865"></a>all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow <a id="l1866"></a>&amp; have left him.

  <p id="par170">The Medes as Herodotus relates, fell off from the king<a id="l1871"></a>dom of the Assyrians  150 years (or a little more) before the reign of <a id="l1872"></a>Cyrus,  that is in the reign of Senacherib  a little after that  great overthrow of his army in  <a id="l1873"></a>Palestine.

The kings <a id="l1998"></a>between the two Darius's are omitted which shews that the history is imperfect <a id="l1999"></a>  They reccon Ardshir the sixt king of this Dynasty <a id="l2000"></a> And  for these reasons this Dynasty was that of the Medes &amp; Persians founded by Cyaxerxes. And the Dynasty of the Pischdadians was that of the Persians <a id="l2001"></a> threatened by the  Pro<a id="l2003"></a>phet Ieremy &amp; mentioned by  Ezekiel as newly destroyed. For <a id="l2004"></a>the Persian historians make the first Dynasty end where the second begins.</p>
     <p id="par183">They tell us also that there was a  potent kingdom of  Tartars or Scythians seated in Turguestan ot Usbec/ Tartary on the north side of the river Oxus <a id="l2006"></a> &amp; east side of the Caspian sea,  whose king Afrasiab in the reign of the seventh king <a id="l2007"></a>of the Pischdadian  conquered the Persians &amp; were soon after <a id="l2008"></a>repulsed &amp; driven back again beyond that river  by Zab or <a id="l2009"></a>Zoub a Prince  descended from the former kings of Persia <a id="l2010"></a>but returned with a potent army from  beyond that river, &amp; <a id="l2011"></a>overcame Gushtasp the son of Zab &amp; conquered all Persia putting <a id="l2012"></a>an end to the race of the Pischdadian kings, &amp; after a few weeks was <a id="l2013"></a>driven out of Persia by the assistance of the first king of the second Dynasty  &amp; returning with <a id="l2014"></a>a fresh army was routed &amp; slain in the mountains of Media by the <a id="l2015"></a>third king of the second Dynasty. [Whence it seems to me that in the reign of Cyaxerxes these <a id="l2016"></a> Tartars invaded Persia on both sides the  Caspian sea, sending Madyes <a id="l2017"></a>westward to invade the Medes &amp; Assyrians while Afrasiab invaded the <a id="l2018"></a>Persians from the north east; &amp; that the kingdom of the Pischdadians <a id="l2019"></a>arose about the same time with the kingdom of the Assyrians there <a id="l2020"></a>being but seven kings of the dynasty before it was invaded by the <a id="l2021"></a>Tartars.</p>
     <p id="par184">The eastern historians tell us indeed that the seven first kings of <a id="l2022"></a>the Pischdadian Dynasty  lived some of them a thousand years a <a id="l2023"></a>piece &amp; reigned all together above three thousand years. But this <a id="l2024"></a>amounts to no more then to let us know that the Pischdadians &amp; their contemporaries  the Assyrians reigned <a id="l2025"></a>in the fabulous ages of the Persians. </p>
     <p id="par185">The same historians have made the kings of the second Dynasty <a id="l2029"></a> reign too long   To the first king of this Dynasty <a id="l2031"></a>they assyine a reigne of 120 years. To the second a reign of 150 years. To <a id="l2032"></a>the third a reign of 60 years. To the 4<sup>th</sup> a reign of 120 years. To <a id="l2033"></a>the fift, as much  To  the sixt called Artaxerxes Longimanus a reign of 112 years 112.

The histories of the Persians written since <a id="l2056"></a>the conquest of  Persia by the Saracens mention these two king<a id="l2057"></a>doms calling them the kingdoms of Persia &amp; Touran or Turguestan<strong>, &amp;</strong> say that this <a id="l2058"></a>kingdom of Persia was the first or oldest Dynasty of the kings of Persia &amp; was immedi<a id="l2059"></a>ately succededed by the second Dynasty. The kings of the first Dynasty <a id="l2060"></a>they call Pischdadians, those of the second Caianides. And the three last <a id="l2061"></a>kings of the 2<sup>d</sup> Dynasty they name Ardsahir Diraz, Darab his bastard son <a id="l2062"></a>&amp; Darab who was conquered by Ascander Roumi, that is Artaxerxes <a id="l2063"></a>Longimanus, Darius Nothus &amp; Darius who was conquered by Alexander <a id="l2064"></a>the Greek. They omit the kings between the two Darius's which shews <a id="l2065"></a>that their history of this kingdom is imperfect. But by the names of <a id="l2066"></a>the three kings its easy to understand that by the second Dynasty <a id="l2067"></a>they mean that of the kings of Media &amp; Persia mentioned in <a id="l2068"></a>scripture &amp; by consequence by the first Dynasty they mean that <a id="l2069"></a>which was contemporary to the kingdom of Assyria &amp; fell in the <a id="l2070"></a>reign of Zedekiah.</p>
     <p id="par188">Those oriental historians tell us also that Afrasiab king of <a id="l2071"></a> Touran or Scythia beyond Oxus, in the reign of the <a id="l2072"></a>seventh king of the Pischdadians passed that river &amp; conquered the <a id="l2073"></a>....... &amp; Cyaxerxes</p>
     <p id="par189">Now while there were but seven kings of the Pischdadians before <a id="l2074"></a>these wars of the Scythians began, it seems to me that this kingdom of <a id="l2075"></a>the Persians arose about the same time with the kingdom of the Assyrians. <a id="l2076"></a>The eastern historians tell us indeed that some of these  Pischdadian Kings lived <a id="l2077"></a> a thousand  years a piece &amp; that they reigned all to<a id="l2078"></a>gether above three thousand years. But .... of the Persians.</p>

  <p id="par194" class="i0">The rise of Kingdoms in Italy was like that in other places <a id="l2099"></a>for Dionisius Halicarnassaus writes how the Region where <a id="l2100"></a>Rome was afterwards built was first peopled by barbarians <a id="l2101"></a>called Siculi. This Region saith he was afterwards taken <a id="l2102"></a>from them by a long war by the Aborigines who till then <a id="l2103"></a>lived in the Mountains in towns without walls spread <a id="l2104"></a>all over the Region, but after the Pelasgi and other <a id="l2105"></a>Greeks intermixed with them &amp; helped them in their <a id="l2106"></a>war against their Neighbours, the Siculi being expelled<a id="l2107"></a>they compassed many Cities with walls &amp; became possest <a id="l2108"></a>of all the territory between the two rivers Livis and <a id="l2109"></a>He speaks of the Aborigines &amp; Pelasgi here as of two <a id="l2110"></a>peoples intermixed, but a little after he takes them to <a id="l2111"></a>be but two names of one and the same people brought <a id="l2112"></a>hither out of Peloponesus by Oenotrus the son of Lycaon <a id="l2113"></a>as above; and thus describes how in the beginning they <a id="l2114"></a>peopled the western part of Italy. Oenotrus saith <a id="l2115"></a>he having found a larger Region fit for pasturage &amp; <a id="l2116"></a>tillage but yet for the most part uninhabited and <a id="l2117"></a>where it was inhabited peopled but thinly: in a <a id="l2118"></a>certain part of it purged from the barbarians he <a id="l2119"></a>built Cities little and numerous in the Mountains: <a id="l2120"></a>which manner of building was familiar to the ancients. <a id="l2121"></a>Then he tells how after they were grown numerous so <a id="l2122"></a>as to want room they made war upon the Siculi as <a id="l2123"></a>above and forced them to leave Italy &amp; seat them<a id="l2124"></a>selves in the next Island, which was ever since <a id="l2125"></a>from them called Sicily. This was that war in which <a id="l2126"></a>the Aborigines first compassed many cities with walls <a id="l2127"></a>as above. Out of such Cities as these arose afterwards <a id="l2128"></a>divers <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p034v"> &lt;034v&gt; </span> Kingdoms in Italy amongst which the Aborigines or <a id="l2129"></a>Latines for a long time made but a small figure tho <a id="l2130"></a>augmented by the new Colonies of Ianus &amp; <span class="larger">Saturnus</span> <a id="l2131"></a>and Evander. They had a King before the Trojan war <a id="l2132"></a>but without being united under him. For about 32 <a id="l2133"></a>years after that war Afranius the son of Æneas built <a id="l2134"></a>the City Alba and instituted there a Council of all the <a id="l2135"></a>Cities under him with Sacrifices to Iupiter: In the time <a id="l2136"></a>of which solemnity one of the young men of best note <a id="l2137"></a>governed the City; and this Council was no doubt (like <a id="l2138"></a>those of the Greeks) erected for uniting all the <a id="l2139"></a>cities into one policy. The Vestal fire was also <a id="l2140"></a>kept in Alba. This Kingdom allowing their Kings a <a id="l2141"></a>reign of 21. years a piece one with another continued <a id="l2142"></a>about 294 years, and then Romulus with a few <a id="l2143"></a>Latines layd the foundation of Rome about 20 miles <a id="l2144"></a>from Alba. Strabo<sup class="note" id="n64-ref">[64]</sup> tells us that this Æqui, Volsci <a id="l2146"></a>and some Aborigines and the Rutuli &amp; other greater <a id="l2147"></a>and lesser Cities dwelt about Rome when it was <a id="l2148"></a>first built and that they dwelt there freely village <a id="l2149"></a>by village without being subject to any com̄on nation <a id="l2150"></a>and that Romulus built Rome in a place assumed <a id="l2151"></a>not by choice but by constraint which was neither <a id="l2152"></a>fortified by nature nor had ground enough to supply <a id="l2153"></a>the City nor men to inhabit it. For the Inhabitants <a id="l2154"></a>of the Region lived each a part and rearhed to the very <a id="l2155"></a>walls of the City, and regarded not the Albani. Such<a id="l2156"></a>were Collatia Antonna Fidena, Lavinium, and other <a id="l2157"></a>such like small Cities not above 4 or 5 miles from Rome. <a id="l2158"></a> To get men therefore he built an Asylum withdrew a <a id="l2159"></a>conflux of people, and with these he warred with the <a id="l2160"></a>King of the Sabines at Lavinium &amp; by compact <a id="l2161"></a>inhabited his Kingdom and being now grown strong <a id="l2162"></a>it may be presumed that other little free Cities around <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p035r"> &lt;035r&gt; </span> about easily complyed with him. For Dionysius Halicarnassaus<sup class="note" id="n65-ref">[65]</sup> <a id="l2163"></a>tells us that this new kingdom as Romulus left it consisted <a id="l2164"></a>of thirty Courts or Councells in so many towns, each with the <a id="l2165"></a>sacred fire kept in the prytanæum of the Court, for the <a id="l2166"></a>Senators who met there to performe sacred rites after the <a id="l2167"></a>manner of the Greeks. Whence the Senators were called <a id="l2168"></a>Curiales. But when Numa the successor of Romulus <a id="l2169"></a>reigned, he having the severall fires in their own <a id="l2170"></a>Courts instituted one com̄on to them all at Rome.</p>
  <p id="par195" class="i0"> Synesius<sup class="note" id="n66-ref">[66]</sup> tells us that the Mountain Bombæa <a id="l2171"></a>in Libya now Cyrene was hollowed and by the concurse of art and <a id="l2172"></a>nature made a most safe retreat being to one that entered it <a id="l2173"></a>full of intricate windings and passages like a Labyrinth &amp; <a id="l2174"></a>difficult to be got out of. And that some compared it to the <a id="l2175"></a>Syringes and subterranean vaults in Egypt. This Mountain <a id="l2176"></a>therefore and the Syringes in Egypt were the habitations of <a id="l2177"></a>the first men; Like the labyrinth in Mount Ida in Crete <a id="l2178"></a>and the Caturūbi in Italy. In the Syringes were Pillars <a id="l2179"></a>of brick or stone on which the first inventions of arts &amp; sciences <a id="l2180"></a>were written by the ancient Egyptians. And no doubt this <a id="l2181"></a>practice was begun before the Egyptians quitted those habi<a id="l2182"></a>tations to live in towns. A late Author tells us that in <a id="l2183"></a>the westerne side of the mountain which runs in a right <a id="l2184"></a>line on the easterne side of the Nile six hundred miles <a id="l2185"></a>beginning about an hundred miles above Memphys, &amp; <a id="l2186"></a>ending at Syena, and the lesser Cataracts, there were Cells <a id="l2187"></a>made all the way of which nothing appeared without but the <a id="l2188"></a>doors, but upon entring into some of them he found them <a id="l2189"></a>to be square rooms regularly cut in the rock and painted <a id="l2190"></a>on the sides of the Rooms with various old paintings of <a id="l2191"></a>men women and Children and boats upon the nile &amp;c. <a id="l2192"></a>In some of the rooms were pillars &amp; stateus of men &amp; women <a id="l2193"></a>and figures of the Gods of Egypt with the heads of birds <a id="l2194"></a>doggs <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p035v"> &lt;035v&gt; </span> oxen &amp;c. In the sides of the rooms were passages into other <a id="l2195"></a>rooms, and in the floors of all the rooms were square <a id="l2196"></a><em class="underline">pitts</em> descending downwards to vaults or cellars below: <a id="l2197"></a>Whence it seems to follow that after the first Inhabitants <a id="l2198"></a>by digging habitations in the mountains of Egypt had <a id="l2199"></a>found out veins of mettalls, with the ways of excocting <a id="l2200"></a>them and working them into tools and utensils they <a id="l2201"></a>applying such tools not only to digging in rocks for <a id="l2202"></a>Gold but also to the making these regular habitations <a id="l2203"></a>and at length to cutting and carving of stones into <a id="l2204"></a>regular figures; &amp; before they quitted their habitations <a id="l2205"></a>to live in Towns, they found out also other various arts <a id="l2206"></a>painting and Navigation upon the Nile &amp; embalming <a id="l2207"></a>the dead after the way of Mummies. For the <a id="l2208"></a>Boats upon the Nile were in form of funerall <a id="l2209"></a>processions, and in Some of the Rooms were figures <a id="l2210"></a>of Mummies. It seems therefore that most arts &amp; <a id="l2211"></a>sciences began in Egypt and were propagated thence <a id="l2212"></a>to the Arabians and from them by the red Sea to <a id="l2213"></a>the Chaldeans.</p>
  <p id="par196" class="i0">Of the original way of living in Caves of the Earth <a id="l2214"></a>there are severall other instances. The Troglodyles <a id="l2215"></a>on the Westerne border of the red Sea for many <a id="l2216"></a>hundred miles together live in Caves of the earth <a id="l2217"></a>without arts &amp; sciences and government to this day; <a id="l2218"></a>The Arabians live either in rocks or little hutts or <a id="l2219"></a>tents. When Sodom and Gomorrha were destroyed <a id="l2220"></a>Lot and his family returned to the original way <a id="l2221"></a>of living in a Cave in the side of a hill: And <a id="l2222"></a>Tavernier in his Iourney from Aleppo through <a id="l2223"></a>Mosull into Persia describes severall habitable Caves <a id="l2224"></a>and Grottos made in Mountains and Rocks in Syria <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p036r"> &lt;036r&gt; </span> Mesopotamia and Assyria for poor people and sometimes <a id="l2225"></a>he describes whole towns living in Caves.</p>
  <p id="par197" class="i0">When the Egyptians [quitted their way of living in Caves &amp;] <a id="l2226"></a>began to build houses and towns is uncertain. Probably <a id="l2227"></a>the invention of sowing Corn put them first upon building <a id="l2228"></a>houses in the lower Egypt for the convenience of tilling <a id="l2229"></a>that Country the same being otherwise uninhabitable <a id="l2230"></a>by reason of the yearly overflowing of the Nile. <a id="l2231"></a>In Abrahams days the Towns of Syria seem to have <a id="l2232"></a>been but few and Small and newly built &amp; some of <a id="l2233"></a>them were built in the days of Abraham as Beersheba <a id="l2234"></a>Abraham and Lot lived in Tents, fed their flocks <a id="l2235"></a>where they pleased and had a right to the wells which <a id="l2236"></a>they dug.</p>
  <p id="par198" class="i0">We have showed above that when Cities were first built <a id="l2237"></a>every City had its proper King and government. These Cities <a id="l2238"></a>were at first but few in Number with very large <a id="l2239"></a>fields, but in time as they grew populous sent out <a id="l2240"></a>people to build villages in their fields for the <a id="l2241"></a>Convenience of pasturage and tillage.</p>
  <p id="par199" class="i0">The herdsmen and Shepherds at first wandered up &amp; <a id="l2242"></a>down in tents seeking pasturage and water for their <a id="l2243"></a>herds and flocks as the Arabians and the Tartars do to this <a id="l2244"></a>day. And in Phœnicia and such other places as <a id="l2245"></a>were fruitfull and well watered fixing their seats <a id="l2246"></a>and buildings Cities and villages where they found the <a id="l2247"></a>best pastures and water. After this manner <a id="l2248"></a>Phœnicia began to be thinly peopled with Cities a little <a id="l2249"></a>before the days of Abraham, And as the people encreased <a id="l2250"></a>the Cities also encreased all the days of Abraham <a id="l2251"></a>Isaac and Iacob. For when Abraham came first <a id="l2252"></a>into Canaan the fields were not so far stockt and <a id="l2253"></a>appropriated but that he and Lot fed their herds and <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p036v"> &lt;036v&gt; </span> flocks wherever they pleased, And the wells which <a id="l2254"></a>they dug were their own. He first wandered in tents <a id="l2255"></a>and dug the well which he called Beersheba then he <a id="l2256"></a>built an altar there and planted the place with <a id="l2257"></a>trees and lived there he &amp; Isaac &amp; Iacob, and the <a id="l2258"></a>place became the City Beershaba. Iacob in his <a id="l2259"></a>way from Mesopotamia came to Succoth and built <a id="l2260"></a>him an house and made booths for his Cattle: there<a id="l2261"></a>fore was the place called Succoth (Genes. 33.17.) <a id="l2262"></a>And this was the Original of the City Succoth. <a id="l2263"></a>The City Schechem had its name from Schechem the <a id="l2264"></a>son of Hamor the Hivite Prince of the Country in <a id="l2265"></a>the days of Iacob (Ios. 24.1, 32) the place where <a id="l2266"></a>Iacob and Laban made a Covenant in mount <a id="l2267"></a>Gilead and raised a heap of stones for a witness <a id="l2268"></a>and called the heap Mizpah became the City Mizpah <a id="l2269"></a>a principal City of Gilead (Gen. 31.48, 49. Iudg. 11.<a id="l2270"></a>11, 29, 34. The City Hebron was built in the field <a id="l2271"></a>of Mamre the Amorite the brother of Eschrol <a id="l2272"></a>the brother of Aner who were contemporary to <a id="l2273"></a>Abraham, and was thence called Mamre (Genes.  13.<a id="l2274"></a>18. and 23.19. 35.27.) Afterwards it was called <a id="l2275"></a>Kiriath Arba or the City of Arba: which Arba <a id="l2276"></a>was a great man among the Anakins being the <a id="l2277"></a>father of Anak their King &amp; the Grandfather <a id="l2278"></a>of Sheshay Ahiman and Talmai whom Caleb <a id="l2279"></a>conquered in the days of Ioshua (Ioshua 14.15. &amp; <a id="l2280"></a>15.13, 14. &amp; Iudg. 1.20.) And then the Israelites <a id="l2281"></a>called this City Hebron (Iudg. 1.10.) when Abraham <a id="l2282"></a>came first into the land of Canaan, before he had <a id="l2283"></a>dwelt there tenn years, he came &amp; dwelt in the <a id="l2284"></a>plane of Mamre &amp; Mamres was then a young man <a id="l2285"></a>(Gen. 13.18. &amp; 14.13, 24.) <a id="l2286"></a>and <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p037r"> &lt;037r&gt; </span> therefore the City Mamre whose feild was called the <a id="l2287"></a>plains of Mamre  was built about the same <a id="l2288"></a>time that Abraham came into the Land of Canaan: <a id="l2289"></a>And Tsoan or Tanis a Royal City of the lower Egypt <a id="l2290"></a>was built seaven years after. (Num. 13.22.) </p> <p id="par200" class="i0">The Land of Canaan being more fruitfull then Arabia <a id="l2291"></a>was therefore peopled with towns more early and <a id="l2292"></a>for that reason Ismael, Moab, Ammon &amp; Esau <a id="l2293"></a>the Children of Abarham Lot, &amp; Iacob went into <a id="l2294"></a>Arabia, finding more room in that Country. Ismail <a id="l2295"></a>had twelve Sons whose names are writed in Scripture <a id="l2296"></a>by their towns and by their Castles twelve princes <a id="l2297"></a>according to their Nations. (Gen. 25.16.) that is his <a id="l2298"></a>twelve Sons built twelve towns and Castles which <a id="l2299"></a>they called by their own names &amp; reigning in them <a id="l2300"></a>became twelve princes in the southern borders of <a id="l2301"></a>Arabia Petræa. Esau had five sons and eleven <a id="l2302"></a>grandsons which were Dukes that is princes reigning <a id="l2303"></a>over so many Cities in Mount Seir. And Seir <a id="l2304"></a>from whom the mountain had its name had seaven <a id="l2305"></a>sons who were all of them Dukes that is founders <a id="l2306"></a>of so many Cities &amp; Nations in mount Seir. And <a id="l2307"></a>this in the days of Isaac. For one of the wives <a id="l2308"></a>of Esau was Aholibamah the daughter of Anah <a id="l2309"></a>whose father of Grand father was Seir the Horite <a id="l2310"></a>or Son of Hori, and the Concubine of Eliphaz the <a id="l2311"></a>eldest Son of Esau was Timna the Sister of Lotan <a id="l2312"></a>the Son of Seir. (Gen. 36.2, 12, 20, 22, 25.) <a id="l2313"></a>Those Horites were driven out by the posterity of <a id="l2314"></a> Esau; and so were the Emims by the posterity <a id="l2315"></a>of Moab, and the Zuzims or Zamzummims by <a id="l2316"></a>the posterity of Ammon. And how thinly <a id="l2317"></a>Arabia petræa was inhabited by the Horites, Emims <a id="l2318"></a>and Zuzims and Amalekites in the days of Abra <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p037v"> &lt;037v&gt; </span> Abraham may appear from hence , that they  <a id="l2319"></a>were all invaded and subdued by the four Kings <a id="l2320"></a>whome Abraham beat with an army of 318 <a id="l2321"></a>men.

  <p id="par201" class="i0">Ægypt being next to Canaan &amp; Arabia petræa <a id="l2322"></a>we reckon planted with Cities and towns about <a id="l2323"></a>the same time with those Countries.

  <p id="par202" class="i0">After Numa Servius Tullius, the field being <a id="l2334"></a>divided, as above, into about 30 territories, on <a id="l2335"></a>the hills and such places as being fortifyed by the <a id="l2336"></a>nature of the place might safily protect the husband<a id="l2337"></a>men, he prepared refuges which the Greeks call <a id="l2338"></a>δήμους.

  <p id="par203" class="i0">Then being very desirous to unite and conjoyn the Cities of the <a id="l2354"></a>Latine Nation into one body polytick lest being weakened <a id="l2355"></a>by intestine discords and wars they should be deprived of their <a id="l2356"></a>liberty by their neighbouring barbarians, he called together the <a id="l2357"></a>cheife men out of the severall Cities declaring to them for <a id="l2358"></a>what great designe about their com̄on advantage he had con<a id="l2359"></a>veyed them. And by this speech he perswaded them to <a id="l2360"></a>build a Temple with inviolable refuge at Rome at their <a id="l2361"></a>common charge, in which the people of all the Cities being <a id="l2362"></a>yearly assembled might performe publick and private sacrifices <a id="l2363"></a>and buy &amp; sell at set times. And if any quarrell or difference <a id="l2364"></a>arose between them it might be determined at these Sacra. <a id="l2365"></a>The decission of the Controversy being permitted to the arbi<a id="l2366"></a>triment of the rest of the Cities. He built therefore at the <a id="l2367"></a>com̄on charge of the Cities The Temple of Diana in the hill <a id="l2368"></a>Aventinus, and wrote the Laws of the Compact made between <a id="l2369"></a>these people in a pillar of brasse which remains to this day <a id="l2370"></a>being erected in the Temple of Diana, and has the Character <a id="l2371"></a>of the Greek Letters which the Greeks used of old. Thus <a id="l2372"></a>far Dionysius. By this unquestionable record you may see <a id="l2373"></a>how difficult it was to unite the Dividend Cities into one <a id="l2374"></a>polity. You have also in the Refuges or fortified towns <a id="l2375"></a>a Specimen of the first Cities &amp; Kingdoms into which men <a id="l2376"></a>convened when they began to make war upon one another. <a id="l2377"></a>The Franks and Britains continued divided into many <a id="l2378"></a>small Kingdoms till Iulius Cæsar invaded them, And the <a id="l2379"></a>ancient Constitution of Spain was like that of other nations. <a id="l2380"></a>For Strabo<sup class="note" id="n67-ref">[67]</sup> speaking in generall of the Collonies which the <a id="l2382"></a>Greeks sent abroad into this and other Nations saith. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p038v"> &lt;038v&gt; </span> The reason why the Greeks wandered to the barbarous <a id="l2383"></a>nations seems to be the distraction of those Nations <a id="l2384"></a>into small parties and Dynasties of such as through <a id="l2385"></a>haughtiness: would not combine with one another: <a id="l2386"></a>whence it hapned that they were weake against those <a id="l2387"></a>who invaded them. This haughtiness prevailed chiefly <a id="l2388"></a>among the spaniards being accompanied also with their <a id="l2389"></a>crafty nature and double mindedness. For they following <a id="l2390"></a>a treacherous and thievish way of life, being bold in little <a id="l2391"></a>things but attempting nothing great, neglected the acquisition <a id="l2392"></a>of great power &amp; society.

One of those Historians <a id="l2477"></a>was Phererides Atheniensis who in the reign of Darius Hystas<a id="l2478"></a>pis or soon after wrote of the Antiquities and ancient <a id="l2479"></a>Genealogies of the Athenians in ten books, and was one <a id="l2480"></a>of the first European writers of this kinde; &amp; one of <a id="l2481"></a>the best whence he had the name of Genealogus, and by <a id="l2482"></a>Dionysius Halicarnassensis<sup class="note" id="n81-ref">[81]</sup> is said to be second to none <a id="l2483"></a>of the Genealogers. Another was Epimenides <sup>m</sup><sup class="note" id="n82-ref">[82]</sup> not the <a id="l2484"></a>philosopher but an historian who wrote of the ancient <a id="l2485"></a>Genealogies.

Hellanicus who was twelve years older then Herodotus <a id="l2490"></a>digested his History by the ages (or successions) of the <a id="l2491"></a>priestesses of Iuno Argiva, others digested theirs by <a id="l2492"></a>those of the Archons of Athens or Kings of the <a id="l2493"></a>Lacodemonians.

And first <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p040v"> &lt;040v&gt; </span> Hippias the Elean, as Plutarch tells us<sup class="note" id="n83-ref">[83]</sup> Published a Breviary of the <a id="l2501"></a>Olympiads supported by no certain arguments.  that is by conjecture without the authority of former writers He was contemporary to Plato, &amp; Plato wrote a dialogue to deride him for his ignorance.. For the Arundelian marbles now composed <a id="l2504"></a>sixty years after the death of Alexander the great. <a id="l2505"></a>(An. 4. Olymp. 128) and yet mention not the Olympiads, <a id="l2506"></a>so that this Æra was not then received, tho it be now <a id="l2507"></a>the principal Æra of the Greeks. In the next Olypiad <a id="l2508"></a>Timæus Siculus a very learned author wrote a history <a id="l2509"></a>in severall books down to his owne times according <a id="l2510"></a>to the Olympiads, comparing the Ephori, the Kings of <a id="l2511"></a>Sparta the Archons of Athens and the preistesses <a id="l2512"></a>of Argos with the Olympionic Victors so as to <a id="l2513"></a>make the Olympiads suit with the Genealogies <a id="l2514"></a>and poetical Histories according to the best of his <a id="l2515"></a>Iudgment, and where he left off Polybius began <a id="l2516"></a>and carried on the history. And Istor at the same <a id="l2517"></a>time wrote against Timæus composing a contrary <a id="l2518"></a>history of ancient Attica in many books, and calling <a id="l2519"></a>him Epitimæus for his frequent and bitter reprehen<a id="l2520"></a>sions.

And other Authors followed each <a id="l2524"></a>confuting those that wrote before and adding <a id="l2525"></a>something of his owne. And this seems to be <a id="l2526"></a>the original of counting by the Olympiads and <a id="l2527"></a>of the technicall Chronology of the Greeks: <a id="l2528"></a>which how uncertain it is, and how little credit <a id="l2529"></a>it gained among the Greeks of those times <a id="l2530"></a>may be <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p041r"> &lt;041r&gt; </span> understood by this passage of Plutarch.<sup class="note" id="n84-ref">[84]</sup> The Congresse <a id="l2531"></a>saith he, of Solon with Cræsus some think they can confute <a id="l2532"></a>by Chronology.

And if in <a id="l2635"></a>some instances they reign 5 or 6 years longer, in <a id="l2636"></a>others they reign as much shorter. Eighteen or <a id="l2637"></a>twenty years is a Medium. So the 15 Kings of <a id="l2638"></a>Iudah who succeded Solomon reigned 390 years <a id="l2639"></a>which is one with another 22 years a piece. <a id="l2640"></a>The 15 Kings of Israel after Solomon reigned <a id="l2641"></a>259 years which is 17 1/4 years a piece. The 18 <a id="l2642"></a>Kings of Babylon (Nabonasser &amp;c) reigned 209 years <a id="l2643"></a>which is 11 2/3 years a piece. The ten Kings of Persia <a id="l2644"></a>(Cyrus &amp;c) reigned 208 years which is almost 21 <a id="l2645"></a>years a piece. The 16 successors of Alexander <a id="l2646"></a>the Great in Syria (Seleurus &amp;c) reigned 244 <a id="l2647"></a>years which is 15 1/4 a piece. The 11 in Egypt (Ptolomeus <a id="l2648"></a>Lagi &amp;c) reigned 277 years which is 25 years a piece. <a id="l2649"></a>The 10 in Macedonia (Aridæus &amp;c) 156 years which <a id="l2650"></a> is 15 1/2 years a piece. The 28 Kings of England <a id="l2651"></a>(William the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p043r"> &lt;043r&gt; </span> Conqueror and his successors) 634 1/2 years which is 22 2/3 years <a id="l2652"></a>a piece. The first 24 Kings of France (Taramond &amp;c) <a id="l2653"></a>458 years which is 19 years a piece: The next 24 Kings  <a id="l2654"></a>of France (Ludovicus Balbus &amp;c) 451 years which is 18 3/4 <a id="l2655"></a>years a piece. The next 15. (Philippus Valesius &amp;c.) 315.  which <a id="l2656"></a>is 21 years a piece. And all the 63 Kings of France <a id="l2657"></a>1224 years which is 19 1/2 years a piece.</p>
  <p id="par209" class="i0">So then the Greeks have made the reigns of their ancient <a id="l2658"></a>Kings too long, &amp; by that means have raised their <a id="l2659"></a>Antiquities too high. The Olympiads being quadrennial <a id="l2660"></a>could not be stirred; but in adjusting the Reigns of their <a id="l2661"></a>Kings to the Olympiads they have made them reign <a id="l2662"></a>earlier then they really did.</p>
  <p id="par210" class="i0">For Lycurgus who in the 18<sup>th</sup> Olympiad restored the <a id="l2663"></a>Discus they have made as old as Iphitus who restored <a id="l2664"></a>the Olympiads, &amp; Iphitus they have made above an <a id="l2665"></a>hundred years older then the Æra of the Olympiads, <a id="l2666"></a>and the return of the Heraclides into Peloponesus they <a id="l2667"></a>have made about 328 years older then this Æra, <a id="l2668"></a>though it was scarce above 60 or 70 years older; and <a id="l2669"></a>the Trojan war they have made 200 years older then <a id="l2670"></a>Sesak, tho by the consent of all antiquities it was <a id="l2671"></a>later then Sesostris who is Sesak and fell in with <a id="l2672"></a>the days of Belus the father of Dido.</p>
  <p id="par211" class="i0">And as they have raised higher the times of their <a id="l2673"></a>Kings, so to helpe out their Chronology they have <a id="l2674"></a>endeavored to raise the Æra of the Olympiads <a id="l2675"></a>proportionaly higher by feinging that before the <a id="l2676"></a>first Olympiad wherein Coræbus was victor there were <a id="l2677"></a>celebrated about 28 other Olympiads, the memory <a id="l2678"></a>of which was entirely lost. Let these 28 imaginary <a id="l2679"></a>Olympiads be rejected and the Reigns of the ancient <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p043v"> &lt;043v&gt; </span> Kings of Greece be shortened in due proportion &amp; adjusted <a id="l2680"></a>to the times of the true Olympiads &amp; of the Kings <a id="l2681"></a>of Phœnicia and Palestine to whome they were <a id="l2682"></a>contemporary, and we shall finde that those ancient <a id="l2683"></a>Kings of Greece reigned about 18 or 20 years a piece <a id="l2684"></a>one with another as the Kings of all nations have <a id="l2685"></a>done ever since. In all History of certain credit <a id="l2686"></a>I have not found tenn Kings together who reigned <a id="l2687"></a>one with another full 30 years a piece. In all the <a id="l2688"></a>Chronology of the Greeks preceding the Persian Monarchy <a id="l2689"></a>the Kings of Greece are made to reign one with another <a id="l2690"></a>above 30 years a piece; and therefore their reigns <a id="l2691"></a>are feigned too long for the Course of Nature, and <a id="l2692"></a>must be shortned.</p>
  <p id="par212" class="i0">Generations from Father to Son may be reckoned <a id="l2693"></a>one with another about 34 years a piece or <a id="l2694"></a> three generations to an hundred <a id="l2695"></a>years. But if the Generations proceed by the <a id="l2696"></a>eldest Sons they are shorter; so that three of them <a id="l2697"></a>may be reckoned to Eighty years. And the Reign <a id="l2698"></a>of Kings is still shorter because Kings are succeeded <a id="l2699"></a>not only by their eldest Sons but sometimes by <a id="l2700"></a>their brothers, and sometimes they are slain, or <a id="l2701"></a>deposed and succeeded by others of an equal or <a id="l2702"></a>greater age, especially in elective &amp; turbulent <a id="l2703"></a>Kingdoms. But the Greeks in computing times <a id="l2704"></a>past by the Reigns of their Kings, and chiefly <a id="l2705"></a>by those of the Kings of Sparta have equalled <a id="l2706"></a>those Reigns to Generations, as if the Kings had <a id="l2707"></a>always succeeded from Father to Son: and by this <a id="l2708"></a>means they have raised their Antiquities much <a id="l2709"></a>too high, as we shall finde by repeating the </p>

  <p id="par216">What Strabo tells us of the Greek colonies, may be <a id="l2786"></a>applied also to the Phœnicians, namely that they by reason <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p046r"> &lt;046r&gt; </span> of the smalness &amp; weakness of the ancient kingdoms easily <a id="l2787"></a>conquered whoever they pleased to seat themselves.

  <p id="par217">If we pass from hence into India we shall find that <a id="l2807"></a>country divided into many kingdoms even when Alexander <a id="l2808"></a>the great invaded it, which was above two hundred years <a id="l2809"></a>after Media &amp; Persia were grown into a Monarchy.</p>
  <p id="par218">One of the first great kingdoms in the world was that <a id="l2810"></a>of Egypt. For <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n92-ref">[92]</sup> Pliny in recconing up the first inventors <a id="l2811"></a>of things ascribes to the Egyptians the invention of a <a id="l2812"></a>royal city &amp; to the inhabitants of Attica that of a <a id="l2813"></a>popular one.

For Thebes was <a id="l2818"></a>famous in Homers days when the four monarchies &amp; <a id="l2819"></a>their head cities were not yet talked of. For, <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n93-ref">[93]</sup> saith <a id="l2820"></a>Strabo, Homer knew nothing of the Empires of the <a id="l2821"></a>Medes &amp; Assyrians, otherwise <sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n94-ref">[94]</sup> naming the Egyptian Thebes <a id="l2822"></a>&amp; her riches &amp; those of the Phœnicians, he would <a id="l2823"></a>not have passed over in silence the riches of Babylon <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p047r"> &lt;047r&gt; </span> Nineveh &amp; Ectabane. The antiquity of this kingdome makes <a id="l2824"></a>it difficult to give an account  of the originals <a id="l2825"></a>of Egypt but some footsteps there are thereof in history.</p>
  <p id="par219">For in the seven years of plenty Ioseph laid up the corn <a id="l2826"></a>in the cities of Egypt, the corn of the field which was round <a id="l2827"></a>about every city laid he up in the same Gen. 41.48. And <a id="l2828"></a>therefore the cities of Egypt being in those days the places <a id="l2829"></a>in which the Egyptians inned their harvests they must have <a id="l2830"></a>been not much further asunder then o<sup>R</sup> villages &amp; therefore <a id="l2831"></a>as numerous &amp; small as the ancient cities of Syria &amp; δή<a id="l2832"></a>μοι of the Medes &amp; Greeks. Which is an argument <a id="l2833"></a>that the first constitution of Egypt was like that of other <a id="l2834"></a>nations. For these cities like δήμοι of Greece united <a id="l2835"></a>under common Councils &amp; thereby grew into kingdoms.</p>
  <p id="par220">For the common Councils of the Greeks were set up <a id="l2836"></a>in imitation of those set up before in Egypt, &amp; the re<a id="l2837"></a>mains of such Councils continued in several parts of <a id="l2838"></a>Egypt till the days of Herodotus. <em class="underline">The Oracle</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">at <a id="l2839"></a>Dodona is very like that at the Egyptian Thebes, <a id="l2840"></a>&amp; the way of divining in the Greeks Temples is taken <a id="l2841"></a>from Egypt. For the Egyptians were the first <a id="l2842"></a>authors of making Conventions &amp; Solemnities &amp; Councils <a id="l2843"></a>&amp; the Greeks learnt these things from them. Of which <a id="l2844"></a>thing I have this argument that their way was in <a id="l2845"></a>use from ancient times but that of Greece lately in<a id="l2846"></a>stituted. Neither do the Egyptians assemble once every <a id="l2847"></a>year but frequently, as in other places so chiefly &amp; <a id="l2848"></a>most studiously in the City Bubastis to the honour <a id="l2849"></a>of Diana, secondly in the city  Busiris to the honour <a id="l2850"></a>of Isis. In which city seated in the middle of the <a id="l2851"></a>Egyptian Delta is the greatest Temple of Isis. Isis is <a id="l2852"></a>she who in Greek is called Δημήτης that is Ceres.

Deut.<a id="l2889"></a>4.16, 17, 18. Iosh. 24.14.

And the multitude of cities in Egypt which had their <a id="l2906"></a>several Temples, Gods, Conventions, High Priests &amp; modes of worship <a id="l2907"></a>argues the multitude of kingdoms &amp; nations in Egypt when <a id="l2908"></a>idolatry began.</p>
  <p id="par222">The manner how the first cities of Egypt grew into <a id="l2909"></a>kingdomes will be best understood by the constitution of <a id="l2910"></a>the kingdom of Athens.

He distinguished the <a id="l2916"></a>people into three orders the Gentry soldiers &amp; mechanicks <a id="l2917"></a>as the Egyptians did, for the Egyptian Gentry were their <a id="l2918"></a>Priests. He ordeined that the soldiers should be husband<a id="l2919"></a>men &amp; till all the land in time of peace as the soldiers <a id="l2920"></a>did in Egypt. He first joyned one man &amp; one woman <a id="l2921"></a>according to a law in Egypt ordeined by Vulcan. He <a id="l2922"></a>first introduced the Egyptian Gods among the Greeks <a id="l2923"></a>&amp; as the Egyptian Priests ware linnen garments so did <a id="l2924"></a>the Athenian. And, saith Diodorus, the sacrifices and <a id="l2925"></a>ancient customes of the Athenians &amp; Egyptians were <a id="l2926"></a>alike. Now whilst he thus imitated the Egyptian customes <a id="l2927"></a>in other things we may reccon that he imitated them <a id="l2928"></a>also  in the Athenian polity of uniting many δήμοι <a id="l2929"></a>&amp; little cities into greater polities by common Councils <a id="l2930"></a>For we have told you out of Pliny that the people <a id="l2931"></a>of Attica were the first among the Greeks who thus <a id="l2932"></a>united &amp; out of Herodotus that the Greeks in these things <a id="l2933"></a>followed the example of the Egyptians.</p>
  <p id="par223">It was the custome of the first ages for every king to <a id="l2934"></a>have in his city a Prytaneum or place of public worship <a id="l2935"></a>for his  people. And if any cities united into one polity <a id="l2936"></a>under any common city they erected a common Prytaneum in <a id="l2937"></a>that city without abolishing the particular ones. This was <a id="l2938"></a>done in Italy after the example of the Greeks &amp; in Greece after <a id="l2939"></a>the example of the Egyptians. And as the Prytanea in the several <a id="l2940"></a>cities of Greece were the remains of ancient kingdoms, so were <a id="l2941"></a>the temples conventions &amp; religions in Egypt. So when Moses tells <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p050r"> &lt;050r&gt; </span> us that Ioseph married the daughter of Potiphera Priest of <a id="l2942"></a>On, we may  understand that On had been once the Metropolis <a id="l2943"></a>of a kingdom but before Ioseph's days the Priests of on <a id="l2944"></a>lost their dominion as kings &amp; became subject to the kings of another <a id="l2945"></a>city. And the like of as many other cities as had Temples or Prytanea, <a id="l2946"></a>without kings &amp; also of  the smaller cities whose Prytaneaus were disused &amp; extinct. <a id="l2947"></a>For as in Greece when single cities became united into bigger <a id="l2948"></a>kingdoms, their Prytaneums in time became disused &amp; the common <a id="l2949"></a>Prtytaneum  the capital city only remained, so <a id="l2950"></a>it is to be understood of Egypt.</p>
  <p id="par224">These capital cities with their Prytaneums &amp; Conventions seem to <a id="l2951"></a>have laid the foundation of the Nomes or  nations of Egypt, every <a id="l2952"></a>Nome having  a capital city with a Temple &amp; Priest &amp; God  &amp; <a id="l2953"></a>annual conventions for the whole Nome  &amp; a Iudge for doing <a id="l2954"></a>justice: so that the Nomes  seem to be the remains of ancient kingdoms, <a id="l2955"></a>the Priests of the capital cities retaining their Priesthood  long after they lost their armies &amp; power as kings. <a id="l2957"></a>For in the first ages all kings were high Priests &amp; Iudges, [&amp; <a id="l2958"></a>all high Priests were kings (after Melchizedec's order of Priesthood)] <a id="l2959"></a>till they became subject to other  kings more potent then them<a id="l2960"></a>selves. These little kingdoms of Egypt began to grow into bigger <a id="l2961"></a>kingdoms before the days of Ioseph &amp; by degrees grew in one <a id="l2962"></a>monarchy before the days of Solomon. And then Sesak made a <a id="l2963"></a>new regulation of the Nomes &amp; built their Temples more sumptu<a id="l2964"></a>ously. How they grew into one monarchy is the next thing to be <a id="l2965"></a>explained.</p>

  <p id="par226" class="i0">fift year of Asa &amp; then began to revolt, that is at <a id="l3010"></a>the death of Sesostris. For Herodotus tells us that Sesostris <a id="l3011"></a>was the only king that enjoyed the empire. Sesostris <a id="l3012"></a>therefore began his reign  in the 17 year of Solomon &amp; <a id="l3013"></a>warred till the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Rehoboam &amp; then returned <a id="l3014"></a>from his wars into Egypt &amp; reigned there eleven years <a id="l3015"></a>more in which time he employed the conquered nations <a id="l3016"></a>in building the Cities &amp; Temples of Egypt &amp; doing other <a id="l3017"></a>great works &amp;  died in the fift year of Asa. <a id="l3018"></a>Whence I gather that he was the brother of Solo<a id="l3019"></a>mon's Queen. For since he  conquered the Libyans in his fathers life<a id="l3020"></a>time, he may be recconed above 20 years old when <a id="l3021"></a>he began to reign &amp; so was about the age of Solomon's <a id="l3022"></a>spouse &amp; her little sister who had no breasts.</p>
  <p id="par227">Pheron is said to be the son of Sesostris. Pliny <a id="l3023"></a>calls him Nuncoreus &amp; Diodorus Sesostris the second. <a id="l3024"></a>They say he made no wars but upon throwing a <a id="l3025"></a>dart into the river Nile became blind &amp; after ten <a id="l3026"></a>years upon a miraculous recovery of his sight placed <a id="l3027"></a>memorable guifts in the Temples &amp; particularly in <a id="l3028"></a>Heliopolis two Obelisks an hundred cubits long &amp; eight <a id="l3029"></a>broad, one of which was carried to Rome by Caius. I <a id="l3030"></a>suspect that he reigned only under his father &amp; died <a id="l3031"></a>before him because according to Manetho Rhampses <a id="l3032"></a>was the eldest son &amp; successor of Sesostris. Or rather I <a id="l3033"></a>suspect that he was the same king with Sesostris. For <a id="l3034"></a>one of his names was Sesostris &amp; another Pheron or <a id="l3035"></a>Pharaoh the common name of the kings of Egypt, &amp; <a id="l3036"></a>as Pheron fell blind so Sesostris in his old age fell blind <a id="l3037"></a>&amp; slew himself. And if Pheron was once blind I had <a id="l3038"></a>rather beleived that he died blind like Sesostris then <a id="l3039"></a>that he recovered his sight in such a miraculous way <a id="l3040"></a>as Herodotus describes.</p>
  <p id="par228">Proteus reigned next after Pheron according to <a id="l3041"></a>Herodotus, but he seems rather to have been a Viceroy <a id="l3042"></a>set over the lower Egypt then a soveraign king. Fof <a id="l3043"></a>he was a Memphite of ignoble extraction &amp; reigned at <a id="l3044"></a>Memphys &amp; is thereby distinguished from the race of the <a id="l3045"></a>Theban kings. And the name Proteus being a Greek word <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p054r"> &lt;054r&gt; </span> which signifies a chief man or Prince, seems to be not the <a id="l3046"></a>proper name of a man but a title of honour. For had <a id="l3047"></a>it been a proper name the Greeks would have retained <a id="l3048"></a>the Egyptian word without translating it whereas Hero<a id="l3049"></a>dotus tells us that it is the kings name in Greek that <a id="l3050"></a>is the Greek word of the same signification with his name <a id="l3051"></a>or title in the Egyptian language, &amp; Diodorus tells us <a id="l3052"></a>that this man's name was Cetes. There were several <a id="l3053"></a>Princes of Egypt called Proteus one of which came with <a id="l3054"></a>Cadmus into Europe. And its probable that the frequent <a id="l3055"></a>changing   of the person might give occasion <a id="l3056"></a>to the Greeks to feign that Proteus put on all shapes. <a id="l3057"></a>Some make him a Phœnician reigning neare Pharus <a id="l3058"></a>where Alexandria was afterwards built as Tzetzes<sup class="note" id="n99-ref">[99]</sup></p>

For when Alexander stole her from <a id="l3067"></a>her husband Menelaus the Greek, in his flight he was <a id="l3068"></a>driven with her upon the coast of Egypt &amp; there sus<a id="l3069"></a>pected by Thonis governor of the place &amp; sent to Pro<a id="l3070"></a>teus at Memphys &amp; Proteus examining the matter <a id="l3071"></a>deteined Helena (as Herodotus relates) &amp; sent home Alexander. Then the <a id="l3072"></a>Greeks demanding her of the Trojans made war upon <a id="l3073"></a>Troy thinking Alexander had carried he thither <a id="l3074"></a>but after the destruction of Troy Menelaus went <a id="l3075"></a>for her into Egypt. And to this history saith Hero<a id="l3076"></a>dotus Homer alludes in mentioning the errors of Paris <a id="l3077"></a>with Helena by sea upon the coast of Sidon before the <a id="l3078"></a>war &amp; voyage of Menelaus into Egypt after it. By <a id="l3079"></a>this History the Proteus of Herodotus reigned in the time <a id="l3080"></a>of the Trojan war, &amp; therefore governed the lower <a id="l3081"></a>Egypt under Amenophis or Memnon.</p>

These wars were made in the 12<sup>th</sup> &amp; 13 years of Nebuchadnezzar &amp;  Arphaxad slain in the 12<sup>th</sup> year according to Ieromes version  of the original Chaldee; &amp; Phraortes was slain by the Assyrians 75 years before the 30 years reign of Cyrus according to Herodotus, &amp; by consequence in the year of Nabonassar 11 or 12<sup>th</sup> year of Chiniladan. And therefore if Arphaxad &amp; Phraortes be one &amp; the same king of the Medes Nebuchadonasar &amp; Chiniladan agree in the years of their reign &amp; actions &amp; are one &amp; the same king of Assyria.

And in the eighteenth year upon the death of his enemy Nebuchadonasar &amp; division of the Assyrian Monarchy he began to repair the Temple &amp; restore the true worship. From that division arose a new Æra of the  kingdom of Babylon to which Ezekiel relates  in the beginning of his Prophesy where he saith: Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year  [that is in the  30<sup>th</sup>year of the Chaldeans]  which was the 5<sup>th</sup> year of Iehojachins captivity, the word of the Lord came unto me in the land of the Chaldeans.

  <p id="par239" class="i0">In the 14<sup>th</sup> year of Iromus say the Tyrian records the <a id="l3246"></a>reign of Cyrus began in Babylonia.

  <p id="par242">For understanding this matter its further to be observed that the Trojan warr was in the 3<sup>d</sup> <a id="l3261"></a>generation after the voyages of Cadmus &amp; Europa recconing about 25 years to a generation to a generation  amounts to  70 or 80 years.. For Homer represents that Idomenus &amp; Meriones the sons of <a id="l3262"></a>Deucalion  &amp; grand sons of Minos the son of Iupiter were at the Trojan warr. He allows but one <a id="l3263"></a>Minos whom he calls the son of Iupiter &amp; father of Deucalion. This Minos was the son of Europa <a id="l3264"></a>&amp; Asterius  king of Crete or as others say of Europa &amp; the  Cretan Merchant who brought her from Phœnicia <a id="l3265"></a> &amp; according to the Poets of Europa &amp; Iupiter.  Minos had many children <a id="l3266"></a> videlicet Androgeus, Deucalion, Astrea, Ariadne, Phædra, Acacillis &amp; was contemporary to  Ægeus king of Athens &amp; his children to Theseus the son of   For Minos made warr upon Ægeus and died soon after him &amp; <a id="l3268"></a> Ægeus  For Ariadne <a id="l3269"></a>fell in love with Theseus &amp; followed him from Crete to Naxos &amp; was there taken away from <a id="l3270"></a> him by Bacchus,  who was the son of Semele &amp; grandson of Cadmus,   <a id="l3271"></a>Afterwards Deucalion reigning  after Minos at Crete gave his sister Phædra to Theseus <a id="l3272"></a>King of Athens in marriage.  Theseus was about 40 years older then  Hellena for  he took her captive when she was but ten years old &amp; he forty. And  Demophoon the son of Theseus &amp; Phædra was at <a id="l3275"></a>the Trojan warr &amp; so was Menestheus the successor of Theseus.  Ino the daughter of <a id="l3276"></a>Cadmus was stepmother to Phrixus  who sailed from Thebes to Colchos just before the <a id="l3277"></a> <a id="l3278"></a> voyage of the Argonauts </p>
  <p id="par243">Now considering all of these things &amp; composing them together it seems to me <a id="l3296"></a>the rapture of Europa  affecting the Phœnicians they noted it in their <a id="l3297"></a>Annals,&amp; there the Phœnician historians above mentioned found it  <a id="l3298"></a>conjoyned with the league which Hiram made with Solomon. But the rapture <a id="l3299"></a>of Hellena  &amp; voyage of Menelaus  in search of her not concerning the Phœ<a id="l3300"></a>nicians, they noted not that in their Annals but the Historians under<a id="l3301"></a>standing that the raptures of Io, Europa, Medea &amp; Hellena had relation to one <a id="l3302"></a>another, concluded that they followed one another within some short time such <a id="l3303"></a>as might be recconed within the compass of the reign of one king. I place <a id="l3304"></a>the rapture of Europa therefore in the beginning of the reign of Solomon &amp; thence reccon <a id="l3305"></a> to the destruction of Troy three generations, which after the <a id="l3306"></a>rate of  30 years to a generation  may end about the 54<sup>th</sup> or 60<sup>th</sup> year <a id="l3307"></a>after the death of Solomon. About which time I reccon that  Memnon <a id="l3308"></a>was in the vigor of his age making  upon foreign nations <a id="l3309"></a>tho he came not as far as Troy. Homer reccons that the last year of the Trojan ‡‡ warr to be the 20<sup>th</sup> from the rapture of Hellena. Subduct these 20 years &amp; the first 14 years of Rehoboams reign &amp; there will remain about 16 or 26 years <a id="l3310"></a>between the return of Sesach into Egypt &amp; the rapture of Hellena, which I account a competent time for the voyages of Phyrxus &amp; the Argonauts during the reign of <a id="l3311"></a>Æetes. For I reccon that Sesach in the return of Æetes with part of his army at Colchos to govern the nations conquered in those parts, that Phyrxus to avoid the malice of his stepmother Ino the daughter of Cadmus,  fled from Thebes to Colchos with his goods in a ship on which a Ram was carved &amp; was there deteined by Æetes that the Argonauts followed him to bring back the ship &amp; goods &amp; brought back also Medea the daughter of Æetes ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 58r &gt; </span>Æetes ✝ that  in their return or soon after Hercules with six ships invaded the Trojans slew Laomedon,  brought away his horses &amp; daughter Hesione, &amp; set Priamus on the throne, that Æetes &amp; Priam sending embassadors to the Greeks for satisfaction but without success, Priam ordered his son Alexander to revenge the injury privately &amp; thereupon Alexander insinuated himself into the friendship of Menelaus &amp; at length stole away his wife &amp; goods. All which might conveniently be done with the space of twenty years.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 57v resumes &gt; </span></p>
  <p id="par244">All nations have be prone to make their first antiquities ancienter then the <a id="l3312"></a>truth. And this they have done  by making the reigns of their kings too long  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p058v"> &lt;058v&gt; </span>  by turning collateral  reigns into successive ones,  by repeating <a id="l3313"></a>the same king under different names,  &amp; sometimes <a id="l3314"></a>under the same name &amp; by feigning kings. So the Greeks of one Minos  have made two &amp; I suspect they <a id="l3315"></a>have done the same by Cecrops, Erictheus &amp; Pandion &amp; some others. And the  reigns of their ancient <a id="l3316"></a>kings they have made much too long for the ordinary course of nature. allotting them one with another 30 or 40 years apiece or above whereas Thirty years <a id="l3317"></a>a piece for  generations &amp; twenty years apiece for reigns   <a id="l3318"></a>seems to me a  moderate allowance taking them one with another.  And  some<a id="l3319"></a>times the  kings are in great measure fabulous as in the catalogues of the ancient kings of Assyria Media  Peloponasesus &amp; Germany. <a id="l3320"></a> And by the like means they have made Inachus  eight hundred years older then David  to whom I reccon him <a id="l3325"></a>contemporary.</p>
 </div>

 <div>
  <p id="par245">For  illustrating  of these recconings it  further observable <a id="l3326"></a>that Theseus was contemporary to Androgeus Ariadne &amp; Phædra the children of Minos <a id="l3327"></a>the son of Europa &amp; to Bacchus the son of Semele the daughter of Cadmus &amp; so was <a id="l3328"></a>two generations later then Cadmus &amp;  Europa,   <a id="l3331"></a>And  Hellen may be recconed a generation younger then Theseus,  On which <a id="l3333"></a>accompt if by a  moderate recconing we allow  one or two years from the rapture of Europe to the birth of Minos <a id="l3335"></a>&amp; about 24 years more to the birth of Androgeus Ariadne &amp; Phædra &amp; eighteen or twenty years <a id="l3336"></a>more to the murder of Androgeus &amp; ten or twelve years more to the  of Theseus into Crete &amp; his accquaintance with Ariadne <a id="l3337"></a>&amp; Phædra, the daughters of Minos &amp; about 10 or 15 years more to his  rapture of captivating Hellena &amp;  <a id="l3338"></a>six or eight  years more to the rapture of Hellena by ALexander there will be about 55 <a id="l3339"></a>or 60 years from the rapture of  Europa to the rapture of Hellen by Alexander. And <a id="l3340"></a>the like number of years may be gathered by allowing about 20  years from <a id="l3341"></a>from the rapture of Europa to  to the birth of  Bacchus &amp;  25 or 30 <a id="l3342"></a> years more to the rapture of Ariadne by Bacchus from Theseus  &amp; 10 or <a id="l3343"></a>15 years more to the rapture of Hellen by Alexander.  In these recconings <a id="l3344"></a>I allow but one Minos, him who was the son Of Europa  &amp; Asterius . For  as the Egyptians by putting their contemporary <a id="l3346"></a>kings in successive order, by respecting the name of the same person, &amp; by <a id="l3347"></a>making their kings reign longer then they did have raised  their antiquities  much beyond the truth so have the Greeks  <a id="l3349"></a>used the same artifice  &amp; therefore the way to approach the truth in the history of these nations <a id="l3351"></a>is to  lower their antiquities by all reasonable  abatements. [The first <a id="l3352"></a>Minos is by the Poets called the son of Iupiter, the second was the father of Deucalion <a id="l3353"></a>Androgeus, Ariadne Phædra &amp; Astræa, Homer mentions them both as the same man] <a id="l3354"></a>Homer allows but one Minos,  whose grandson Idomoneus was at the Trojan war <a id="l3355"></a>&amp; is made by Homer to speak thus</p>
