<h2 id="hd1" class="cent"> Sect II. <a id="l1"></a><br>The two Witnesses. </h2><p id="par1">The Dragon &amp; Beast have their proper churches true &amp; false. The <a id="l2"></a>false Church of the Dragon is the two horned Beast as above &amp; his true Church <a id="l3"></a>is the seven Churches of Asia. The fals church of the Beast is Whore <a id="l4"></a>of Babylon &amp; his true Church is the two Churches called the two Witnesses <a id="l5"></a>For the Witnesses are called two Candlesticks &amp; two Olive trees &amp; Candlesticks <a id="l6"></a>signify Churches Apoc 1.20 &amp; so do Olive trees Rom. 11.17 Therefore while <a id="l7"></a>the whole Empire continues undivided &amp; is both Dragon &amp; Beast, the Church <a id="l8"></a>of the whole Empire is both the seven Churches &amp; the two Witnesses: But <a id="l9"></a>when the Empire becomes divided &amp; the Dragon is put for the  <a id="l10"></a> Greek Empire &amp; the Beast for the Latin Empire, the seven Churches <a id="l11"></a>signify the true Church of God in the Eastern Empire &amp; the two witnesses <a id="l12"></a>are his true Church in the  western. For the Beast makes war with the <a id="l13"></a>two witnesses &amp; overcomes them &amp; kills them &amp; their dead bodies lye in the streets <a id="l14"></a>of the great city Babylon &amp; therefore they are in the western Empire &amp; <a id="l15"></a>the seven Angels or Angels of the seven Churches sound the  Trumpets &amp; <a id="l16"></a>pour out the Vials or drink offerings at the seven sacrifices while the  Empire <a id="l17"></a>continues divided, &amp; therefore the seven Churches do not cease when the Woman <a id="l18"></a>separates from them &amp; flyes into the wilderness, but continue in being &amp; by consequence remain in the Dragons Kingdom . </p>


<span class="pagenumber" id="p001v"> &lt;1v&gt; </span><p id="par4">Now as the Dragon &amp; Beast by the   number of their heads &amp; horns tally <a id="l49"></a>one another as a mark of their being originally <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span><sub> , </sub><span class="nb-n">}</span></span> united: so the seven Churches <a id="l50"></a>of Asia &amp; the Woman in the Wilderness tally<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span> . <span class="nb-n">}</span></span> one another in the number of Churches. For the heads of <a id="l51"></a>the Beast are called seven  mountains where the woman sitteth  <a id="l52"></a>&amp; mountains are a type of royal Cities the seats of kingdoms &amp; every <a id="l53"></a>kingdom has its Church. After the little horn of Daniels fourth Beast <a id="l54"></a>which is this woman, had  in its rise <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>rooted<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> up three of the ten kings she <a id="l55"></a>reigned over the remaining seven  ( such from their first number are also called ten )  &amp; the seven Churches of these kingdoms answer in number to the <a id="l56"></a>seven Churches of Asia .  Before she separated she was the <a id="l57"></a>seven Churches of Asia: by separation every Church became two, a true one <a id="l58"></a>&amp; a false one &amp; the seven false ones fled into the wilderness &amp; reigned over <a id="l59"></a>the seven  mountains in the form of a great Whore. </p>
<p id="par5">In like manner the two Witnesses &amp; two horns of the second Beast tally one <a id="l60"></a>another as to the number of Churches. For as the Witnesses are two Churches so also the two horns <a id="l61"></a>of this beast  are Churches being like the Lambs',  seven horns  which represent the seven Churches of Asia. Whence it seems  <a id="l63"></a>to me that the two Witnesses &amp; two horns of this Beast were originally united the two <a id="l64"></a>Witnesses being the sincere part of Christs visible Church from the beginning &amp; the two horned <a id="l65"></a>Beast the dissemb<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>l<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ing hypocritical part corrupt part called Nicolaitans &amp;  fals Apostles &amp; the fals Prophet Balaam.. For as the ten horned Beast was  from <a id="l66"></a>the beginning &amp; his rising out of the sea signifies only his  separating from the Dragon <a id="l67"></a>so the two horned Beast  was from the beginning, being the Fals Prophet called Balaam whose doctrine is the doctrine of the Nicola<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>i<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>tans.  &amp; his rising out of the earth <a id="l68"></a> signifies only  his  separating from the two Witnesses. Now the Church of the whole <a id="l69"></a>Empire  was distinguished from the beginning into Greeks &amp; Latines &amp; this distinc<a id="l70"></a>tion was improved by the building of Constantinople &amp; dividing the Empire between this city &amp; Rome &amp; still further  improved by divi<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>d<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ing <a id="l71"></a> the Empire between the sons of Constantine the Great: whereby the Woman <a id="l72"></a>received two wings of a great Eagle that She might fly into the Wilderness.  <a id="l73"></a>And  as the four wings of the Leopard signify the division of the <a id="l74"></a>kingdom of the Greeks into four kingdoms so the  two wings of the Woman signify her <a id="l75"></a>division into the Greek &amp; Latin Churches which churches are in different respects the two <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>w<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>itnesses &amp; the two <a id="l76"></a>horns of the  second Beast.  So then as the first Beast  had his heads &amp; his wound before he <a id="l80"></a>rose out of the Sea so the second Beast had his two horns before he rose out of the earth <a id="l81"></a>&amp; as the Dragon separated from the Beast and retired into the Eastern Empire without losing any <a id="l82"></a>of his horns so the  second Beast  separated  &amp; retired into the Eastern <a id="l83"></a>Empire without losing either of his horns, &amp; so the two Witnesses continue to be called two <a id="l84"></a>notwithstanding their retiring into the west, there being a mixture of Greeks &amp; <a id="l85"></a>Latines in both Empires &amp; names &amp; characters once imposed remaining to the end of <a id="l86"></a>the Prophesy. </p>
<p id="par6">So then as the  Dragon &amp; first Beast do each of them signify the <a id="l87"></a>whole Roman Empire from the beginning untill it becomes divided &amp; then separaate <a id="l88"></a>from one another &amp; signify the two parts: so the Seven Churches, the Woman, <a id="l89"></a>the two Witnesses &amp; the two horned Beast  are all of them from the beginning &amp; do in several respects signify the <a id="l90"></a>  Church of the whole Roman Empire untill it becomes divided into four parts two true Churches &amp; two fals ones,  &amp; then <a id="l91"></a>separate from one another &amp; signify those  parts. Before the division the seven Churches <a id="l92"></a>&amp; Woman  do each of them signify the whole Church: the seven Churches <a id="l93"></a>have Nicolaitans  among them  &amp; the Nicolaitans hold the doctrine of Balam the fals Prophet <a id="l94"></a>represented by the two horned <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>B<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>b<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>east &amp; they that oppose &amp; testify against the Nicolaitans are <a id="l95"></a>the two Witnes<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>es. </p>
<p id="par7">Now as the  separation of the ten horned Beast is represented by his rising out of <a id="l96"></a>the sea &amp;  that of the two horned Beast by his rising out of the earth, so the separation of <a id="l97"></a>the two witnesses is represented by  the building of a new Temple</p></div>

<p id="par8">When the Church of God ceases to be represented by the seven Churches <a id="l99"></a>of Asia it begins to be represented by the two Prophets or Witnesses. For at <a id="l100"></a>that time  as many of the Churches as will not worship the Image of <a id="l101"></a>the Beast are mystically killed &amp; by being killed become the Martyrs <a id="l102"></a>or Witnesses of Iesus &amp; the 144<sup>000</sup> who are then  selected out <a id="l103"></a>of all the twelve tribes of Israel and sealed with the seale of God in <a id="l104"></a>their foreheads stand on Mount Sion with the Lamb &amp; sing a new <a id="l105"></a>song  before the throne in the Temple of God &amp; before the <a id="l106"></a>four Beasts &amp; the Elders &amp; by reason of their being killed are called the first fruits unto God &amp; to the <a id="l107"></a>Lamb     in respect of the following harvest &amp; in their mouth was found no lye &amp; therefore they are true Witnesses . <a id="l109"></a>  They also stand on the sea of glass in the Temple before the throne having gotten the <a id="l110"></a>victory over the Beast &amp; over his Image by   not worshipping <a id="l111"></a>them &amp; by  being sealed with the seal of God , &amp; there they sing the song of Moses the servant of God &amp; the song <a id="l112"></a>of the<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Lamb with harps , that is, they prophesy &amp; henceforward are the Prophets of God.  . For the  sons of Asaph Heman <a id="l113"></a>&amp; Ieduthun who were appointed by David to sing in the temple at the <a id="l114"></a>sacrifices with Harps &amp; other musical instruments are said to prophesy <a id="l115"></a>with Harps 1 Chron. 25.1, 2, 3 And Saul met a company of Prophets prophesying <a id="l116"></a>with a psalter<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>y<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; a tabet &amp; a pipe &amp; a harp before them.  1 Sam. 10 <a id="l117"></a>  Now these <a id="l118"></a><span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>W<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>itnesses or Prophets being  the people of God throughout the whole Roman <a id="l119"></a>Empire they are by the division of this Empire into the Eastern &amp; western <a id="l120"></a>Empire distinguished into two bodies of Witnesses or Prophets &amp; are thence called the <a id="l121"></a>two witnesses &amp; the two Prophets. For these two Empires have their Churches <a id="l122"></a> false &amp; true. Their false Churches are the Whore of Babylon <a id="l123"></a>or Woman Iezebel who calleth her self a Prophetess &amp; the two– <a id="l124"></a>horned Beast  called also the fals Prophet.

For these two  Prophets are called Candlesticks &amp; Olive trees <a id="l127"></a>&amp; Candlesticks signify Churches Apoc. 1.20 &amp; so do Olive trees Rom. 11.17 . The remnant of the womans seed whom <a id="l128"></a>the Dragon went to make war upon  &amp; who keep the commandments of <a id="l129"></a>God &amp; have the  <span class="large">testimony</span> of Iesus are the true <a id="l130"></a>witness or Prophet in the kingdom of the Dragon &amp; the <span class="large">martyrs</span> of Iesus <a id="l131"></a>with whose blood the Woman is drunken are the true  Witness or Prophet in the <a id="l132"></a>kingdom of the Beast. These are the two leggs of the son of man who  in <a id="l133"></a>the beginning of the prophesy of the seven thunders set his right foot upon the  <a id="l134"></a>sea &amp; his left foot upon the earth. [ As the two leggs of Nebuchadnezzar's <a id="l135"></a>Image<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> represent the Western &amp; eastern  <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>R<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>oman Empires so the <a id="l136"></a>two leggs of the son of Man represent their Churches. ] And as the seven eyes <a id="l137"></a>of the lamb &amp; seven lamps or stars represent the seven spirits of God or seven Angels or teachers of <a id="l138"></a>the  seven Churches, so the two eyes of the son of Man represent the teachers <a id="l139"></a>of the two Churches. </p>
<p id="par9">Now in calling these two Prophets the two Olive trees  &amp; two Candlesticks standing before the God of the earth there.  <a id="l140"></a>there is a plain allusion to Zechary's vision of two Olive trees emptying their oyle into  a <a id="l141"></a>Candlestick in the second Temple.

And when the two horned Beast  rose out of the earth or  <a id="l245"></a>eastern Empire &amp; caused  an oracle to be erected by whose dictate all that would not worship the Oracle or image of the <a id="l246"></a>Beast to be killed, its to be understood that they lived among the people of <a id="l247"></a>the two horned Beast &amp; that this Beast by the Oracle caused his king the Dragon in whose king<a id="l248"></a>dome they lived to make war upon them &amp; kill them. The Beast was <a id="l249"></a>the Western Empire, the people of the Eastern Empire were compelled to <a id="l250"></a>worship  his Image &amp; those that  would not worship  it <a id="l251"></a>were mystically killed in the war which the Dragon made upon them. </p>
<p id="par17">Now this distinction of the Christians into those that worshipped the <a id="l252"></a>Image &amp; those that were killed for not worshipping it signifies <a id="l253"></a>the same thing with the distinction of the twelve tribes of  Israel <a id="l254"></a>into those that  received the mark of the Beast &amp; those that <a id="l255"></a>were sealed with the seal of God. The Western Empire was a spiritually <a id="l256"></a>barren wilderness, the 144000 were sealed in the Greek Empire or being sealed  in both Empires were translated with the Dragon &amp; seven Churches <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>into<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the Greek Empire being the  <a id="l257"></a>true Church in his kingdom.

<p id="par18">Thus the Western Empire being left destitute of a Temple &amp; true Church <a id="l261"></a>in the kingdom of the Beast,  a new Temple is built there, that is, the true Christians which  at the final division of the <a id="l263"></a>Empire  remained among the latines &amp; before this division were a part of the  Temple of the Dragon <a id="l264"></a>are considered as a second Temple newly built by this Division. </p>

<p id="par22">When the Woman  fled from the Temple of heaven on mount Sion into the <a id="l286"></a>Wilderness &amp;  left a remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of God: <a id="l287"></a>it is to be conceived that this remnant were the remnant of the seven churches &amp; stayed in the Temple being the 144000  which were sealed out of the 12 Tribes &amp; stand with the Lamb <a id="l288"></a>on mount Sion,  before the throne &amp;  before the four animals &amp; the Elders: &amp;  &amp; continue to be represented by the seven candlesticks in this Temple. They are also the Victors which stand upon the sea of Glass in <a id="l292"></a>the same Temple.  And  the seven Angels which sound the  Trumpets &amp; pour out the  vials of wrath are the Angels of this remnant of the seven Churches represented by the seven lamps in these  candlesticks <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>F<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span><span class="nb-n">}</span></span> It is also to be conceived that the Woman  in fleeing from Mount Sion into the wilderness changed her Metropolis. She fled from the seven golden <a id="l294"></a>candlesticks which represent the seven churches of Asia her first Metropolis <a id="l295"></a>&amp;   in flying she went through the wilderness of Arabia to  the great city called Babylon  her new Metropolis.  This Babylon <a id="l297"></a> is the seven hilled city opposed to the seven churches,  the city Rome which to this day is the Metropolis of the Woman claims <a id="l298"></a>a supreme metropolitan power over all the Christian Churches.   The seven hills or mountains where the woman  sitteth are literally the seven hills on which Rome stood, but mystically they are the <a id="l300"></a>  seven heads of the Beast that is  they are the seven <a id="l301"></a>   royal cities or  head cities of the seven  <a id="l302"></a>kingdoms represented by those seven horns of the Beast which remained after the little horn of Daniels fourth <a id="l303"></a>Beast had rooted up three of the ten first horns  . For mountains in <a id="l304"></a>sacred prophesy signify cities, &amp; the Spirit gives a double interpretation of <a id="l305"></a>the seven heads of the Beast  calling them both mountains &amp; kings, saying:  <em class="underline">Here is  the mind that hath <a id="l306"></a>wisdome. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the Woman sitteth <a id="l307"></a>Also they are seven kings: five are fallen &amp; one is &amp; the other is not <a id="l308"></a>yet come</em> &amp;c. According to the first interpretation the seven heads  <a id="l309"></a>are contemporary to one another like the four heads of Daniels Leopard &amp; signify seven <a id="l310"></a> contemporary kingdoms, the seven mountains upon which the great <a id="l311"></a>City is seated being made a type of the imperial cities of these kingdoms &amp; the seven churches  of these seven cities are set in opposition to the seven Churches of the seven cities of Asia.  Acc<a id="l312"></a>ording to the second interpretation the seven heads are seven successive dynas<a id="l313"></a>ties of the Roman Empire five of which wer<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> fallen before the Beast rose <a id="l314"></a>out of the abyss or sea.  In this last sense the heads  belong more properly <a id="l315"></a>to the Dragon than to the Beast: in the other sense they belong more pro<a id="l316"></a>perly to the Beast than to the Dragon. </p>

A cloud is the symbol of a multitude. The Angel <a id="l443"></a>is cloathed with a cloud of witnesses or Prophets. The  two horned Beast is called <a id="l444"></a> a fals Prophet &amp; the  great Whore is the woman Iezebel which calleth <a id="l445"></a>her self a Prophetess. In opposition to these two fals Prophets God has his <a id="l446"></a>two true Prophets in the earth &amp; Sea represented by the two leggs of the <a id="l447"></a>mighty Angel: &amp; these two true Prophets prophesy out of the sealed book <a id="l448"></a>from the time that the book is opened, &amp; comprehend all Gods people in <a id="l449"></a> the whole Roman Empire, as well the 144000 as the two witnesses <a id="l450"></a>prophesy out of it against the Fals Prophet &amp; against the fals <a id="l451"></a>Prophetess. The 144000 &amp; the two witnesses are but two names of one <a id="l452"></a>&amp; the same Church of God. And if after the final division of the Empire <a id="l453"></a>one of these names be used in describing the affairs of this Church within the <a id="l454"></a>eastern Empire &amp; the other name be used in describing the affairs of this <a id="l455"></a>Church within the Western, yet for preserving the unity of Gods Church <a id="l456"></a>both these names are still to be taken for names  derived <a id="l457"></a>from the whole &amp; properly significant of the whole   but applied to the several <a id="l458"></a>parts for the conveniencee of describing the affairs of those parts severally. <a id="l459"></a>Tis an usual figure to call a part by the name of the whole ( as when <a id="l460"></a>we call a dead body by the name of a man &amp; every part of a river by the <a id="l461"></a>name of the river &amp; the ten Tribes by the name of Israel ) &amp; this figure is here made use of. As in the history of the Bible the ten tribes <a id="l462"></a>are distinguished from the two Tribes by the name of Israel &amp; yet the two <a id="l463"></a>tribes are at the same time a part of Israel: so in the Apocalyps the people of God in the <a id="l464"></a>western empire may be distinguished from his people in the eastern by the <a id="l465"></a>names of the two witnesses &amp; the 144000, &amp; yet at the same time his people <a id="l466"></a>in the <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>astern empire may be a part of the two witnesses &amp; his people in <a id="l467"></a>the western a part of the 144000. So far as the   people <a id="l468"></a>of the eastern &amp; western empires are distinguished from one another &amp; <a id="l469"></a>considered in this prophesy distinctly, so far they are represented distinctly by <a id="l470"></a>the Dragon, Beast, Fals Prophet, Woman, 144000 &amp; two witnesses:  &amp; so <a id="l471"></a>far as they are considered without distinction, so far each of those types <a id="l472"></a>extend to the  people of the whole Empire without distinction. And <a id="l473"></a>therefore before the final division of the Empire, they extend each of them <a id="l474"></a>to the whole; after that division while they all continue together they are <a id="l475"></a>taken distinctly   &amp; particularly: but s<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>o<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> soon  as any <a id="l476"></a>of them cease &amp;  thereby the distinction begins to be taken away <a id="l477"></a>the survivors so far as the distinction is taken  away begin again to be taken generally &amp;  <a id="l478"></a>extend to the whole without distinction.  During the reign of the Woman  <a id="l479"></a> Babylon the great is her proper name written in her forehead, &amp; She <a id="l480"></a> &amp; the two horned Beast or <a id="l481"></a>fals Prophet are considered distinctly: but so soon as  the <a id="l482"></a>Woman is burnt with fire,  &amp; this Babylon is fallen, the names of great <a id="l483"></a>Babylon &amp; the fals Prophet extend to the whole without distinction. For after the <a id="l484"></a>woman is burnt its said that three unclean spirits like froggs came out of the <a id="l485"></a>mouth of the Dragon Beast &amp; fals Prophet to gather the nations together to the <a id="l486"></a>battel of the great day of God Almighty, &amp; the Beast &amp;  fals Prophet &amp; kings of <a id="l487"></a>the earth (  or kings of the east  whose way was prepared to this battel by the drying up of Euphrates ) were  gathered together <a id="l488"></a> against the army of heaven, &amp; the Beast  &amp; fals Prophet were taken <a id="l489"></a>&amp; cast alive into the lake of fire &amp; the remnant  ( the kings of the earth or east ) were slain with the two edged sword. <a id="l490"></a>Here the woman is not named because she was burnt before, &amp; the remnant of her <a id="l491"></a>seed who continue to worship the Beast &amp; his Image are comprehended under the name <a id="l492"></a>of the  fals Prophet he being next heir to the woman.  It is also <a id="l493"></a>said that in this battel the great city was divided into three parts &amp; great Babylon came in remembrance before God to give unto <a id="l494"></a>her the cup of the wine of the fiirceness of his wrath: &amp; here great Babylon doth <a id="l495"></a>not signify the woman, for she was burnt before: but it 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> comprehends all the three remaining parts of that  great city the whole Roman Empire, two of which <span class="small">parts</span> <a id="l496"></a>are cast alive into the lake of fire &amp; the third is slain with the two edged sword. <a id="l497"></a>And in like manner, after the Beast is cas<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>t<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> alive into the lake of fire, the Dragon <a id="l498"></a>who is his next heir is no longer limited to the eastern Empire but extends into <a id="l499"></a>the whole. For when the Dragon  that old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan is <a id="l500"></a>shut up in the bottomless  pit that he should deceive the nations no more till a thousand <a id="l501"></a>years are expired, we are thereby to understand that the spirit of error ceases a thousand <a id="l502"></a>years in all the nations &amp; kingdoms of this world which at the sounding of the seventh <a id="l503"></a>Trumpet become the kingdoms of our Lord &amp; his Christ, that is, in all the kingdoms within <a id="l504"></a>the compass of the four monarchies. So also the two Witnesses which are opposed <a id="l505"></a>to the two winged Woman, upon the burning of that woman are no longer <a id="l506"></a>restrained to the western empire but ascending up to heaven in a cloud preach the <a id="l507"></a>everlasting gospel to  every nation &amp; kindred &amp; tongue &amp; people. And  <a id="l508"></a> at the same time the 144000 grow into a great multitude which no man <a id="l509"></a>could number, of all nations &amp; people &amp; kindreds &amp; tongues with palms in their <a id="l510"></a>hands, &amp; thereby become one &amp; the same Ch<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>u<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>rch catholic with the two witnesses. <a id="l511"></a>This is that Church called the Lamb's wife at whose marriage the kingdoms of <a id="l512"></a>the earth like sheep &amp; oxen are  mystically sacrificed by the victorious two edged sword <a id="l513"></a>&amp; all the fowls of heaven  invited to the marriage supper  ( that is, the army on white horses )  are,  not literally but <a id="l514"></a>mystically,  filled with their flesh. For by this victory the Palm-bearing multitude come <a id="l515"></a>out of the great tribulation. So then the Woman &amp; two Witnesses, &amp;  the  <a id="l516"></a> two horned Beast &amp; 144000 signify the Churches  false &amp; true of <a id="l517"></a>the whole Empire: but yet during the division of the Empire untill the fall of Babylon, <a id="l518"></a>for expressing that division  &amp; describing the actions of  the churches in <a id="l519"></a>either part, the names of the two first are applied in a more especial manner <a id="l520"></a>to the Churches in the western empire &amp; the names of the two first to the Churches in <a id="l521"></a>the eastern. </p>
<p id="par32">Now the two Witnesses prophesy  in sackcloth 1260 days, &amp; the <a id="l522"></a>Gentiles tread under foot the holy City 42 months &amp; so long also the woman is fed in the Wilderness &amp; the Beast acts as long.  . The times are equal <a id="l523"></a>&amp; by their equality are known to be coincident. When the Gentiles begin <a id="l524"></a>to tread under foot the holy  city &amp; the Beast begins to act &amp; the Woman is arrived <a id="l525"></a>at her place of honour in the wilderness &amp; begins to be fed there by the merchants of the <a id="l526"></a>earth, then the two Witnesses put on sackcloth.  They prophesyed before, but <a id="l527"></a>now they begin to prophesy in mourning.   But the period when they begin,  <a id="l528"></a>is  not yet known, because <a id="l529"></a>it involves the knowledge of the end of the 1260 days which are not yet expired. <a id="l530"></a>For the designe of this Prophesy is not to enable us to foreknow things, but <a id="l531"></a>by the fulfilling thereof to enable us to know certainly that it is a true prophesy &amp; by consequence that there is a God above who <a id="l532"></a>foreknows all things &amp; governs the world by his providence, &amp; that Iesus Christ, the Lamb <a id="l533"></a>who was slain, rose again from the dead &amp;  received this prophesy from <a id="l534"></a>God &amp;  that he alone was worthy to receive it &amp;  became worthy by his death whereby he has also washed away the sins of <a id="l535"></a>his people in his blood &amp; made them kings &amp; Priests, having merited a kingdom <a id="l536"></a>for as many as he shall chuse to be his subjects when he comes to revive the dead &amp; reward <a id="l537"></a>every man according to his works. </p>

<p id="par34">But tho the end of the 1260 days cannot yet be justly known, yet <a id="l540"></a>there is reason to believe that the days are not yet expiring. For the <a id="l541"></a>Gentiles which tread under foot the holy city,  are <a id="l542"></a>called Gentiles with respect to their idolatry, &amp; idolatry is not complete without <a id="l543"></a>the worshipping images. Invocation of dead men is a breach of the first commandment
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> worshipping of Images is a breach of the second, &amp;  this is properly Idol-worship or idolatry.

<p id="par35">The ten kingdoms into which the western Empire was divided <a id="l552"></a>were  at first of different religions, &amp; their kings were not all of them <a id="l553"></a>converted to the Roman catholic faith till about the beginning of the Woe-Trumpets <a id="l554"></a>&amp; after that it was sometime before the generality of the people of some of those <a id="l555"></a>kingdoms were converted to that faith. And before such  conversion, the tenn <a id="l556"></a> kings or kingdoms could not be said to  have one mind &amp; to agree &amp; <a id="l557"></a>give their kingdom to the Beast, &amp; before they did so the Beast might not be <a id="l558"></a>said to act in the sense of the Apocalyps nor to carry the Woman upon his back. <a id="l559"></a>&amp; perhaps this  agreement &amp; acting might not begin before the erecting of <a id="l560"></a>the western Empire by Charles the great, &amp; perhaps not before the breaking of <a id="l561"></a>this Empire into smaller parts at the death of his son A.C. 440, whereby the Pope <a id="l562"></a>might reign over them with more power than <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>o<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ver the whole. </p>

This Church  did not obtein Peters patrimony &amp; tiths for her nourishment <a id="l567"></a> till the reign of Pipin &amp; Charles the great, nor arrived to its <a id="l568"></a>full dignity before the subjects of the Pope began to swear allegiance <a id="l569"></a>to him &amp; he was declared above all humane judicature &amp;  took upon <a id="l570"></a>him to create Charles the great an Emperor A.C. 800 &amp; even after that <a id="l571"></a>he grew  still greater. </p>
<p id="par38">The little horn of Daniels fourth Beast had times &amp; laws given <a id="l572"></a>into his hand for a time &amp; times &amp; half a time, which is the same interval <a id="l573"></a>of time with that of  feeding the Woman in the wilderness. <a id="l574"></a>But before this horn began to act in such an absolute manner it is to <a id="l575"></a>be conceived that he established himself by rooting up three of the first <a id="l576"></a>horns which fell before him as he rose &amp; this was not compassed before <a id="l577"></a>the fall of the kingdom<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of the Lombards which was one of the three &amp; <a id="l578"></a>fell A.C. 774. </p>
