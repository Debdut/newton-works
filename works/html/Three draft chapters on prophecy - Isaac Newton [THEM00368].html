<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">Chap. VII. <a id="l1"></a><br>Of the prophesy of the Ram <a id="l2"></a>and He Goate.</h2>
<p id="par1">The four Monarchies predicted by the vision of the image composed <a id="l3"></a>of four metalls, &amp; again by the four Beasts, are again predicted by that of the Ram <a id="l4"></a>&amp; he Goat; the two first being represented by the Ram, &amp; the two last by the Goat. <a id="l5"></a>For the Ram had two horns both of which were high, &amp; the higher horn came up last; <a id="l6"></a>&amp; this Ram having two horns is said to be the kings of Media &amp; Persia, that is the <a id="l7"></a>kingdoms. The higher horn which came up last is the kingdom of Persia, &amp; this arose at <a id="l8"></a>the fall of the kingdom of Babylon; &amp; the lower horn which came up first is the preceding <a id="l9"></a>kingdom of the Medes, &amp; this arose at the fall of the kingdom of Assyria, &amp; is here consider<a id="l10"></a>ed from the time of the date of this prophesy which was in the third year of the reign of <a id="l11"></a>Belshazzar. By the fall of the empire of the Assyrians &amp; the division thereof between <a id="l12"></a>the Medes &amp; Babylonians, the two empires of the Medes &amp; Babylonians arose together <a id="l13"></a>under Cyaxeres &amp; Nebuchadnezzar, &amp; they are represented by the two wings of the <a id="l14"></a>Lyon, Dan. VII.4. And these continued standing together till that of the Medes by the <a id="l15"></a>conduct of Cyrus a Medo-Persian subdued that of the Babylonians, &amp; then began <a id="l16"></a>it self to fall by the revolt of Cyrus &amp; the Persians. For upon the conquest of <a id="l17"></a>Babylon by the Medes, Cyrus &amp; the Persians revolted from the Medes, I think before <a id="l18"></a>the end of the yeare, &amp; beat them in battel the next year; &amp; the king of the Medes <a id="l19"></a>raised a new army &amp; was again beaten the year following &amp; lost his kingdom to <a id="l20"></a>Cyrus, who by that victory set the Persians above the Medes. Now in the history of <a id="l21"></a>the life of Daniel (Dan. I.21) its said that he continued even untill the first year <a id="l22"></a>of Cyrus, that is, untill the first year of his reign over Media: &amp; afterwards <a id="l23"></a>(Dan. X.1) its said that he received the prophesy of the scripture of truth in the <a id="l24"></a>third year of Cyrus, that is in the third year of his reign over Persia. And therefore <a id="l25"></a>the Persians revolted two years before he conquered the Medes. He conquered <a id="l26"></a>Babylon Anno Nabonass. 209 &amp; died Anno Nabonass. 218 according to the Canon of <a id="l27"></a>Ptolomy, &amp; reigned seven years after his conquest of the Medes according to <a id="l28"></a>Xenophon, &amp; therefore conquered them Anno Nabonass. 211. The horn therefore <a id="l29"></a>which rose up first, represents the kingdom of the Medes from the time of <a id="l30"></a>the fall of the Assyrian Empire, or at the least from the time of the third <a id="l31"></a>year of Belshazzar, the year in which this Prophesy was given; &amp; the second <a id="l32"></a>horn represents the kingdom of the Persians which began to rise up Anno <a id="l33"></a> Nabonass. 290, &amp; within two years after overcame the kingdom of the Medes.</p>
<p id="par2"><em class="underline">The He-Goat had a notable horn between his eyes, &amp; smote the <a id="l34"></a>Ram &amp; brake his two horns, &amp; waxed very great: &amp; when he was strong the <a id="l35"></a>great horn was broken off, &amp; for it came up four notable ones towards the four <a id="l36"></a>winds of heaven</em>. And these represent the same kingdoms with the four wings of Daniel's <a id="l37"></a>third Beast. The Goat is called the king of <em class="underline">Iavan</em>, that is, the king of the people <a id="l38"></a>descended from <em class="underline">Iavan</em> the son of <em class="underline">Iaphet</em>, &amp; is usually interpreted to signify the <a id="l39"></a>king of Greece, that is, the kingdom; &amp; in the reign of his first horn it signifies the <a id="l40"></a>kingdom of Alexander the great &amp; his brother Aridæus &amp; two sons. After their <a id="l41"></a>reign the governours of Provinces put crowns on their   own heads, &amp; thereby <a id="l42"></a>divided the Monarchy into smaller kingdoms the four chief of which were <a id="l43"></a> the kingdoms of Macedon Egypt Syria &amp; Thrace. And these are represented <a id="l44"></a>by the four horns. <em class="underline">And in the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressors <a id="l45"></a>are come to the full</em>, that is, in the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes when the <a id="l46"></a>transgressors against the holy covenant are arrived at the height; not before <a id="l47"></a>but in his reign, <em class="underline">after one of them</em> [after the kingdom of Madedon] <em class="underline">came forth a <a id="l48"></a>little horn which waxed exceeding great</em>. For in the eighth year of Antiochus, <a id="l49"></a>when they had spoiled the temple, prohibited the daily worship, burnt the sacred <a id="l50"></a>books, &amp; set up the religion of the heathens in all Iudea; the kingdom of Macedon, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span> the principal horn of the four was conquered by the Romans, &amp; the ships which <a id="l51"></a>the Romans at the time of this conquest sent with an embassy against  <a id="l52"></a>Antiochus Epiphanes then in Egypt, are called the ships of Kittim<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> the <a id="l53"></a>son of Iavan, &amp; so belong to the body of the Goat. And if we may regard <a id="l54"></a>the prophesy of Balaam so far as it is recited by Moses in favour of Israel, <a id="l55"></a>the Romans are there also called Kittim. <em class="underline">And ships</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">shall come <a id="l56"></a>from Kittim, &amp; shall afflict Assur &amp; shall afflict Eber</em>. Assur is here put for <a id="l57"></a>Syria. Italy was so far peopled from Greece as to be called <em class="underline">magna Græcia</em>, <a id="l58"></a>&amp; it might be peopled originally from Kittim<sup>*</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> tho we want the history <a id="l59"></a>thereof.<span class="ns">☉</span> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 25v &gt; </span><span class="ns">☉</span> For it was usual  before the times of the Trojan war to call the <a id="l60"></a>people by the names of their kings &amp; princes.. And some <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> tell us that Telephus <a id="l63"></a>the son of Hercules &amp; Auge &amp; father of Latinus reigning in Italy changed the <a id="l64"></a>name of the Cetij (or posterity of Kittim) into that of Latines.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 26r resumes &gt; </span> But it is sufficient to make the Romans a horn of the Goat that <a id="l65"></a>they are called Kittim in the prophesies of Daniel.</p>
<p id="par3">This horn was at first but a little one comparatively to what it be<a id="l66"></a>came afterwards, <em class="underline">It waxed exceeding great towards the south</em> by conquer<a id="l67"></a>ing Afric Libya &amp; Egypt, <em class="underline">&amp; towards the east</em> by conquering Asia minor, Armenia <a id="l68"></a>&amp; Syria <em class="underline">&amp; towards the pleasant land</em> by conquering Iudea. <em class="underline">It waxed great <a id="l69"></a>even to the host of heaven</em> (the people of the Iews,) <em class="underline">&amp; it cast down some <a id="l70"></a>of the host &amp; of the starrs to the grownd, &amp; it stamped upon them. Yea he <a id="l71"></a>magnified himself even to the Prince of the host, the Prince of princes</em> <a id="l72"></a>[Iesus Christ whom he crucified] <em class="underline">&amp; by him the daily sacrifice was taken <a id="l73"></a>away &amp; the place of his Sanctuary</em> (the Temple) <em class="underline">was cast down</em>, viz<sup>t</sup> in <a id="l74"></a>the war which he made upon the Iews in the reign of Nero &amp; Vespasian <a id="l75"></a><em class="underline">And the host was given over to him by the transgression against the daily <a id="l76"></a>sacrifice, &amp; it cast down the truth to the grownd &amp; it practised &amp; prospered</em>. <a id="l77"></a>For in the reign of the Emperor Hadrian the Romans built a temple <a id="l78"></a>to Iupiter Olympius on mount Sion where the temple of the Iews <a id="l79"></a>had stood, &amp; provoked them to rebell, &amp; made war against them with <a id="l80"></a>very great slaughter, &amp; banished them from Iudæa upon pain of death, <a id="l81"></a>&amp; placed the carved statue of a hog on one of the gates of the city.</p>
<p id="par4"><em class="underline">Then</em>, saith Daniel, <em class="underline">I heard one saint speaking, &amp; another <em class="underline">saint</em> said <a id="l82"></a>to that certain saint that spake, How long shall be the vision concerning <a id="l83"></a>the daily sacrifice &amp; the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both <a id="l84"></a>the  sanctuary &amp; the host to be troden under foot? And he said <a id="l85"></a>unto me, Vnto two thousand &amp; three hundred</em> (prophetic) <em class="underline">days. Then <a id="l86"></a>shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</em> – – <em class="underline">For at the time of the end shall <a id="l87"></a>be the vision</em> – – <em class="underline">even at the last end of the indignation</em>, that is, at <a id="l88"></a>the last end of Gods indignation against the Iews, or at the last end of <a id="l89"></a>the long captivity &amp; dispersion of the Iews predicted by Moses &amp; the <a id="l90"></a>prophets, which is not yet at an end. Thus the power of this last horn <a id="l91"></a>of the Goat became mighty but not by his own power; not by the <a id="l92"></a>power of Kittim or Iavan, but by that of Afric, Armenia, Syria, France, <a id="l93"></a>Spain, Helvetia, Dacia, &amp; Germany conquered by Kittim.</p>
<p id="par5">Some take this little horn to be Antiochus Epiphanes, as if Antiochus was <a id="l94"></a>a little horn growing out of another horn, &amp; the Goat had five horns standing <a id="l95"></a>up at once. But Daniel by the horns of a Beast understands not single kings <a id="l96"></a>but kingdoms. The ten horns of the fourth Beast were  ten kingdoms, &amp; the <a id="l97"></a>four horns of the Goat were four kingdoms, &amp; are called kingdoms by Daniel <a id="l98"></a>himself, Dan. VIII.22. And the first horn, the great horn in the room of which <a id="l99"></a>the four came up, was of the same kind with the four. The horn after which <a id="l100"></a>the little horn came up, was one of the four: &amp; Antiochus &amp; his kingdom <a id="l101"></a>were not two horns. Each of the four horns had many kings, &amp; Antiochus <a id="l102"></a>was only one of those many kings. It was at first a little one &amp; grew <a id="l103"></a>mighty towards the south &amp; towards the east &amp; up to the host of heaven. <a id="l104"></a>But Antiochus did not so. He made no conquests. The little horn magni<a id="l105"></a>fied himself even to the Prince of the host, &amp; cast down his sanctuary to <a id="l106"></a>the grownd, &amp; so did not Antiochus. He did not cast down the Temple to <a id="l107"></a>the grownd, nor stand up against the Prince of princes. He only polluted <a id="l108"></a>the temple &amp; took away the daily sacrifice during three years or 1080 <a id="l109"></a>days, 1 Maccab. I.20, 29, 54. He spoiled the temple two years before, but did <a id="l110"></a>not then take away the daily sacrifice, &amp; the whole five years amount <a id="l111"></a>only to 1800 days. Before this, some Iews apostatized from the law to the <a id="l112"></a>heathen religion, &amp; got a licence from the king to do after the ordinances <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027r"> &lt;27r&gt; </span>of the heathens, &amp; built a place at Ierusalem for their religious assemblys <a id="l113"></a>1 Maccab.

<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">Chap.  X 10 <a id="l118"></a><br>Of the Prophesy of the seventy weeks.</h2>
<p id="par6">The vision of the image composed of four metalls was given first to <a id="l119"></a>Nebuchadnezzar &amp; then to Daniel in a dream. And Daniel began then to be <a id="l120"></a>celebrated for revealing of secrets, Ezek. XXVIII.3. The vision of the four Beasts <a id="l121"></a>&amp; of the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven was also given to Daniel in a dream. That of the Ram &amp; the hee Goat appeared <a id="l122"></a>to him in the day time when he was by the bank of the river Vlay, &amp; was explained <a id="l123"></a>to him by the prophetic Angel Gabriel. It concerns the Prince of the host &amp; the <a id="l124"></a>Prince of princes. And now in the first year of Darius the Mede over Babylon, <a id="l125"></a>the same prophetic Angel appears to Daniel again &amp; explains to him what is <a id="l126"></a>meant by the son of man &amp; by the Prince of the host &amp; the Prince of princes. <span class="ns"></span><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 27v &gt; </span><span class="ns"></span> The prophesy of the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven relates <a id="l128"></a>to the second coming of Christ, &amp; that of the Prince of the host relates <a id="l129"></a>to his first coming: &amp; this prophesy of the Messiah in explaining <a id="l130"></a>them  relates to both comings, &amp; assignes the times thereof.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 27r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par7">This prophesy like all the rest of Daniels prophesies consists of two <a id="l131"></a>parts, an introductory prophesy &amp; and an explanation thereof. The prophesy begins <a id="l132"></a>thus. <em class="underline">Seventy weeks are allotted upon thy people &amp; upon thy holy city</em> &amp;c These <a id="l133"></a>are to be dated from the time that the Iews, after their government was dissolved <a id="l134"></a>by the Babylonian captivity, began to be reunited into a body polytic so as to become <a id="l135"></a>again a people &amp; a holy city; &amp; this was in the seventh year of Artaxerxes <a id="l136"></a>Longimanus, the year in which Ezra<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> came to Ierusalem with a  commissi<a id="l137"></a>on from the king to set up magistrates &amp; judges to judge the people who know the <a id="l138"></a>laws of God, &amp; to teach those that know them not, &amp; to punish offenders against <a id="l139"></a>the laws of God &amp; the king with death, or banishment, or confiscation of goods, <a id="l140"></a>or imprisonment. Seventy weeks are allotted upon them <em class="underline">to finish transgressi<a id="l141"></a>on, &amp; to make an end of sins, &amp; to make reconciliation for iniquity, &amp; to bring in <a id="l142"></a>everlasting righteousness, &amp; to seal up the vision &amp; the prophesy &amp; annoint <a id="l143"></a>the most holy</em>. All which was accomplished by the death of Iesus Christ. And <a id="l144"></a>from the seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus to the death of Iesus Christ <a id="l145"></a>were 490 years; that is, just seventy weeks, recconing seven years to a <a id="l146"></a>week, as is done in Gen. XXIX.27, 28. From the Hebrew word Messiah which <a id="l147"></a>signifies annointed; the most holy who is annointed, is in the next words called <a id="l148"></a>the Messiah the Prince; &amp; this is the  son of man coming in the clouds of heaven <a id="l149"></a>mentioned in the preceding prophesies. <em class="underline">Know also &amp; understand that</em> [after his <a id="l150"></a>annointing &amp; a long captivity to follow it] <em class="underline">from the going forth of the com<a id="l151"></a>mandment to restore &amp; to build Ierusalem unto</em> [the coming of] <em class="underline">the Messiah</em> <a id="l152"></a>[to reign as] <em class="underline">the Prince, shall be seven weeks</em>. This is the prophesy concern<a id="l153"></a>ing the times of the coming of Christ first to be annointed &amp; then to reign: &amp; the inter<a id="l154"></a>pretation distinguishes these two comings, &amp; is as follows.</p>
<p id="par8"><em class="underline">Also threescore &amp; two weeks the street shall be built again &amp; the wall</em> <a id="l155"></a>[unto his coming: but not in prosperous times as in the seven weeks,] <em class="underline">but in <a id="l156"></a>troublesome times</em>: that is 434 years counted from the 28<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l157"></a>Artaxerxes Longimanus in which the wall was finished &amp; the gates set up <a id="l158"></a>according to Iosephus, unto the birth of Christ. <em class="underline">But after</em> [his coming at <a id="l159"></a>the end of ] <em class="underline">the threescore &amp; two weeks, the Messiah shall be cut off &amp; not <a id="l160"></a>reign over them</em> [as at the end of the seven weeks,] <em class="underline">but the people of a Prince <a id="l161"></a>to come</em> [the Romans] <em class="underline">shall destroy the city &amp; the sanctuary, &amp; the end thereof <a id="l162"></a>shall be with a flood, &amp; unto the end of the war desolations are determined</em> <a id="l163"></a>[viz<sup>t</sup> in the reign of Nero, Vespatian, &amp; Adrian.] <em class="underline">Yet he shall keep the co<a id="l164"></a>venant</em> [that of the Iews being Gods peculiar people] <em class="underline">with many for one <a id="l165"></a>week</em> [till the calling of  Cornelius &amp; the Gentiles which was seven years <a id="l166"></a>after his resurrection] <em class="underline">&amp; in half a week</em> [or three years &amp; an half, by the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p028r"> &lt;28r&gt; </span> war of Nero &amp; Vespasian] <em class="underline">he shall cause the sacrifice &amp; oblation to cease, &amp; with <a id="l167"></a>the overspreading of Abominations</em> [in the days of Hadrian by banishing <a id="l168"></a>the Iews from Iudea &amp; giving their land to the heathens who overspread it <a id="l169"></a>with their abominations] <em class="underline">he shall make it desolate even untill the con<a id="l170"></a>summation &amp; that which is determined shall be poured upon the desolate</em> [that <a id="l171"></a>is, during the two thousand &amp; three hundred years counted, I think, from <a id="l172"></a>the destruction of the temple: &amp; then shall the Iews return from all na<a id="l173"></a>tions into their own land, &amp; the sanctuary shall be cleansed.]</p></div>

<h2 id="hd3" class="cent">Chap. IX. <a id="l174"></a><br>Of the prophesy of the Scripture of <a id="l175"></a>truth.</h2>
<p id="par9">This prophesy begins thus. <em class="underline">And I</em>, saith the Angel, <em class="underline">in the first year <a id="l176"></a>of Darius the Mede, even I stood to confirm &amp; to strengthen him. And now <a id="l177"></a>I will shew thee the truth. Behold here shall stand up yet three kings in <a id="l178"></a>Persia</em> [Cyrus, Cambyses, &amp; Darius Hystaspis,] <em class="underline">&amp; the fourth</em> [Xerxes] <em class="underline">shall <a id="l179"></a>be far richer then they all, &amp; by his strength through his riches he shall stirr <a id="l180"></a>up all against the realm of Greece. And a mighty king</em> [Alexander the <a id="l181"></a>great] <em class="underline">shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion &amp; do according <a id="l182"></a>to his will. And when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken &amp; shall <a id="l183"></a>be divided towards the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor <a id="l184"></a>according to his dominion wherewith he ruled. For his kingdom shall be <a id="l185"></a>pluckt up</em> [for Cassander king of Macedon, Lysimachus king of Thrace, <a id="l186"></a>Ptolomy king of Egypt, &amp; Seleucus king of Syria &amp;] <em class="underline">even for others besides those</em>.</p>
<p id="par10">After this the prophetic Angel describes the actions of the kings of <a id="l187"></a>Syria &amp; Egypt by the names of the kings of the north &amp; south untill the conquest <a id="l188"></a>of the kingdom of Macedon by the Romans, which was in the eighth year of An<a id="l189"></a>tiochus Epiphanes. Antiochus began his reign in the 137<sup>th</sup> year of the king<a id="l190"></a>dom of the Greeks. (1 Maccab. I.10,) &amp; smote Egypt, &amp; returned from thence <a id="l191"></a>the first time &amp; spoiled the temple in the 143<sup>d</sup> year (1 Maccab. I.20) &amp; <a id="l192"></a>after two full years, that is, in the 145<sup>t</sup> year (1 Maccab. I.29, 54) in <a id="l193"></a>returning from Egypt the second time, he surprized &amp; smote Ierusalem <a id="l194"></a>&amp; put a garrison therein, &amp; interdicted the worship in the Temple, &amp; <a id="l195"></a>commanded that the Iews should leave their children uncircumcised, &amp; that <a id="l196"></a>all men should be of one religion upon pain of death. And on the 15<sup>th</sup> day of <a id="l197"></a>the month Casleu in the same year, they set up the abomination of desola<a id="l198"></a>tion (as the historian calls it) upon the Altar in the temple, &amp; built idol-<a id="l199"></a>altars throughout the cities of Iudah, &amp; burnt the books of the law, &amp; com<a id="l200"></a>manded that those who preserved them should be put to death. All this was <a id="l201"></a>done in the eighth year of the king.<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> And for pointing out this very remark<a id="l202"></a>able period, Daniel pursues the description of the affairs of the kings of the <a id="l203"></a>north &amp; south very particularly untill he comes to it, &amp; then describes <a id="l204"></a>it by telling us that the king of the north  <em class="underline">at the <a id="l205"></a>time appointed shall come towards the south a second time</em>: <em class="underline">but the <a id="l206"></a>latter</em> expedition <em class="underline">shall not be as the former. For the ships of Chittim <a id="l207"></a>shall come against him. Therefore he shall be grieved &amp; return</em> from the <a id="l208"></a>south, that is, from Egypt, <em class="underline">&amp; have indignation against the holy covenant: <a id="l209"></a>so shall he do, he shall even return</em> out of Egypt, <em class="underline">&amp; have intelligence <a id="l210"></a>with them that forsake the holy covenant</em>. And when he had thus carried <a id="l211"></a>on the description of the affairs of the kings of the north &amp; south to the <a id="l212"></a>eighth year of Antiochus Epiphanes, he passes from the affairs of the <a id="l213"></a>Greeks descended from Iavan,to those of the Romans descended also from Iavan, &amp; describes <a id="l214"></a>them by much larger steps then he had done those of the Greeks. In <a id="l215"></a>the prophesy of the Ram &amp; He Goat, its said that after one of the four <a id="l216"></a>horns of the Goat came forth a little horn &amp; waxed exceeding great, <a id="l217"></a>that is, after one of the four kingdoms of the Greeks came forth a <a id="l218"></a>kingdom of the Romans. And the same transition is here repeated in <a id="l219"></a>the following manner.</p>
<p id="par11"><em class="underline">And after him arms shall stand up</em>: that is, after Antiochus Epi<a id="l220"></a>phanes. As תחלך signifies after the king Dan. XI.8, so here מפגו sig<a id="l221"></a>nifies after him. These arms appear upon the body  of the goat by <a id="l222"></a>conquering Macedon, &amp; stand up gradually by conquering Carthage &amp; <a id="l223"></a>Afric, Asia, Armenia, Syria, Iudæa, France, Spain, Britain, &amp; Egypt. And <a id="l224"></a>then <em class="underline">they pollute the sanctuary of strength &amp; take away the daily sacrifice</em> <a id="l225"></a>[in the days of Nero &amp; Vespatian] &amp; <em class="underline">&amp; place the abomination which maketh</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030r"> &lt;30r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">desolate</em> [in the days of Adrian.] <em class="underline">And they that understand among the people</em> <a id="l226"></a>[the Apostles &amp; other Christian teachers,] <em class="underline">shall instruct many, yet they <a id="l227"></a>shall fall</em> [in the heathen persecutions] <em class="underline">by the sword &amp; by flame &amp; by <a id="l228"></a>captivity &amp; by spoile many days. Now when they shall fall they shall be <a id="l229"></a>holpen with a little help</em> [in the reign of Constantine the great &amp; his sons] <em class="underline">but many</em> <a id="l230"></a>[pretending to come over to them from the heathens] <em class="underline">shall cleave to them <a id="l231"></a>with flatteries</em> [being still heathens in their hearts &amp; feigning themselves <a id="l232"></a>Christians for the sake of interest &amp; preferment.] <em class="underline">And some of those of <a id="l233"></a>understanding shall fall</em> [by new disputes] <em class="underline">to try them &amp; to purge</em> [them from <a id="l234"></a>the flatterers] <em class="underline">&amp; to make them white even to the time of the end, because <a id="l235"></a>it is yet for a time appointed</em>.</p>
<p id="par12">In the reign of Constantine the great when the Christians were <a id="l236"></a>holpen with a little help, the heathen empire began to fall, &amp; thereby to <a id="l237"></a>fill the Christian Churches with dissemblers. And this continued untill the reign <a id="l238"></a>of Iulian the Apostate, who revived the heathen empire for a year <a id="l239"></a>&amp; eight months. And after his death  the heathen religion was tolerated untill the Empe<a id="l240"></a>rors Gratian &amp; Theodosius the great rejected the title of Pontifex <a id="l241"></a>maximus of the heathens; which put an end to it in the Roman <a id="l242"></a>government.</p>
<p id="par13"><em class="underline">And the king shall do according to his will &amp; he shall exalt &amp; <a id="l243"></a>magnify himself above every God, &amp; shall speak marvellous things <a id="l244"></a>against the God of Gods</em> [the ancient of days,] <em class="underline">&amp; shall prosper till the <a id="l245"></a>indignation</em> [or long captivity of the Iews] <em class="underline">be accomplished. For that <a id="l246"></a>that is determined shall be done. Neither shall he regard the God <a id="l247"></a>of his fathers</em> [those who were holpen with a little help] <em class="underline">nor the <a id="l248"></a>desire of weomen</em> [in lawfull matrimony, but set up the professi<a id="l249"></a>on of Moncks &amp; Nunns,] <em class="underline">nor regard any God for he shall mag<a id="l250"></a>nify himself</em> [ preferring his own will] <em class="underline">above all. And in his estate <a id="l251"></a>shall he honour Mahuzzims</em>, [potent saints, the souls of dead men] <a id="l252"></a><em class="underline">together with a strange God</em> [a new God] <em class="underline">whom his fathers</em> [those <a id="l253"></a>who were holpen with a little help] <em class="underline">knew not, shall he honour them</em> <a id="l254"></a><em class="underline">with gold &amp; silver, &amp; with pretious stones, &amp; valuable things. Thus <a id="l255"></a>shall he do in the most strong holds</em> [or temples of his God] <em class="underline">with a <a id="l256"></a>strange God, whom he shall acknowledge &amp; increase with glory, <a id="l257"></a>&amp; cause them</em>  [the Mahuzzims] <em class="underline">to rule over many, &amp; <a id="l258"></a>Divide</em> [among them] <em class="underline">the land for a patrimony</em>.</p>
<p id="par14"><em class="underline">And at the time of the end shall the king of the south</em> [or Em<a id="l259"></a>pire of the Saracens] <em class="underline">push at him. And the king of the north</em> [the <a id="l260"></a>empire of the Turks] <em class="underline">shall come against him like a whirl<a id="l261"></a>wind with chariots &amp; horsmen &amp; with many ships; &amp;</em> [by conquer<a id="l262"></a>ing Constantinople A.C. 1453] <em class="underline">he shall enter into the countries <a id="l263"></a>&amp; shall overflow &amp; pass over. He shall enter also into the glo<a id="l264"></a>rious land</em> [of Iudea,] <em class="underline">&amp; many countries</em> [in those parts] <em class="underline">shall be <a id="l265"></a>overflown. But these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom &amp; Moab &amp; <a id="l266"></a>the chief of the children of Ammon</em> [to whom his Caravans in <a id="l267"></a>their way to Mecca pay tribute.] <em class="underline">He shall stretch forth his hand <a id="l268"></a>also upon the countries; &amp; the land of Egypt shall not escape. But he <a id="l269"></a>shall have power over the treasures of Gold &amp; silver &amp; over all the <a id="l270"></a>pretious things of Egypt. And the Libyans &amp; the Ethiopians shall be at <a id="l271"></a>his steps.</em></p>
<p id="par15"><em class="underline">But tidings out of the east &amp; out of the north shall trouble him: therefore <a id="l272"></a>he shall go forth with great fury to destroy &amp; utterly to make away many. And he <a id="l273"></a>shall plant the tabernacle of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy <a id="l274"></a>mountain: yet he shall come to his end</em> [in the battel of the great day] <em class="underline">&amp; none <a id="l275"></a>shall help him. And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great Prince <a id="l276"></a>which standeth for the children of thy people</em>, [the Prince of Princes with a two-<a id="l277"></a>edged sword] <em class="underline">&amp; there shall be a time of trouble such as there never was since there <a id="l278"></a>was a nation even to that same time. And at that time thy people shall be delivered <a id="l279"></a>every one that shall be found written in the book. And many that sleep in the</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p031r"> &lt;31r&gt; </span> <em class="underline"> dust shall awake some to everlasting life &amp; some to shame &amp; <a id="l280"></a>everlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of <a id="l281"></a>the firmament, &amp; they that turn many to righteousness as the starrs for ever <a id="l282"></a>&amp; ever. But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words &amp; seale the book even to the <a id="l283"></a>time of the end</em>. This is that book which in the visions of Iohn the Apostle was <a id="l284"></a>sealed with seven seales, &amp; which the Lamb of God took out of the hand of <a id="l285"></a>him that sat upon the throne to open the seals thereof. And then <em class="underline">many shall <a id="l286"></a>run to &amp; fro</em> [the two witnesses at the time of the end] <em class="underline">&amp; knowledge shall be in<a id="l287"></a>creased.</em></p>
<p id="par16"><em class="underline">Then I Daniel looked &amp; behold there stood other two, one on this side <a id="l288"></a>of the bank of the river &amp; the other on that side of the bank of the river. And <a id="l289"></a>one said to the man cloathed in linnen who was upon the waters of the <a id="l290"></a>river. How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? And I heard the man <a id="l291"></a>cloathed in linnen who was upon the waters of the river, when he held <a id="l292"></a>up his right hand &amp; his  left hand unto heaven, &amp; sware by him that <a id="l293"></a>liveth for ever &amp; ever, that it shall be for a time times &amp; an half</em>. This <a id="l294"></a>is the duration of the reign of the last horn of Daniel's fourth beast. <a id="l295"></a>And therefore the affairs of that horn are included in this Prophesy. <em class="underline">And</em> <a id="l296"></a>[after this] <em class="underline">when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of <a id="l297"></a>the holy people</em> [by bringing them back out of all nations into Iudea] <a id="l298"></a><em class="underline">then all these things shall be finished</em>.</p>
<p id="par17"><em class="underline">And I heard but I understood not. Then said I: O my Lord, what <a id="l299"></a>shall be the end of these things? And he said, Go thy way Daniel, For <a id="l300"></a>the words are closed up &amp; sealed till the time of the end. Many shall</em> <a id="l301"></a>[then] <em class="underline">be purified &amp; made white &amp; tryed</em> [by persecutions &amp; these are the <a id="l302"></a>two witnesses.] <em class="underline">And none of the wicked</em> [in power] <em class="underline">shall understand</em> [because it is against them]<em class="underline">: but the wise</em> <a id="l303"></a>[under persecution] <em class="underline">shall understand. And from the time that the daily worship</em> [not <a id="l304"></a>only that of the Iews, but that also of the converted Gentiles] <em class="underline">shall <a id="l305"></a>be taken away, so as to set up the</em> [great] <em class="underline">abomination</em>  <em class="underline">which maketh desolate</em> [untill he shall have accomplished to <a id="l307"></a>scatter the power of the holy people] <em class="underline">there shall be a thousand <a id="l308"></a>two hundred &amp; ninety days. Blessed is he that waiteth &amp; cometh <a id="l309"></a>to the thousand three hundred &amp; five &amp; thirty days. But go thou <a id="l310"></a>thy way</em> [Daniel] <em class="underline">till the end be. For thou shalt rest, &amp; stand in <a id="l311"></a>thy lot</em> [amongst those that awake out of the dust] <em class="underline">at the end of <a id="l312"></a>the days</em>.</p>
