<h2 id="hd1" class="cent"><span class="large">Chap. II.<a id="l1"></a><br>Of the Kingdome of Egypt.</span></h2>
<p id="par1">The first great kingdome in the world on this side the <a id="l2"></a>Indies seems to have been that of Egypt. For <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> Pliny in recconing <a id="l3"></a>up the first inventors of things ascribes to the Egyptians the <a id="l4"></a>invention of a royal city &amp; to the inhabitants of Attica that <a id="l5"></a>of a popular one. Which is as much as to say that Athens was <a id="l6"></a>by the Greeks accounted the first city in the world under which <a id="l7"></a>other cities united into a popular dominion by a common <a id="l8"></a>Council, &amp; the Egyptian Thebes the first city which became <a id="l9"></a>the seat of a kingdom. For Thebes was famous in Homer's <a id="l10"></a>days when the four Monarchies &amp; their head cities were <a id="l11"></a>not yet talked of. <em class="underline">For</em>, <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> saith Strabo, <em class="underline">Homer knew nothing <a id="l12"></a>of the Empire of the Medes &amp; Assyrians, otherwise <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> naming <a id="l13"></a>the Egyptian Thebes &amp; her riches &amp; those of the Phœnici<a id="l14"></a>ans, he would not have passed over in silence the riches <a id="l15"></a>of Babylon Nineve &amp; Ecbatane</em></p>
<p id="par2">Egypt is a long &amp; narrow tract of land running north &amp; south on both sides the river Nile between  <a id="l16"></a>mountains &amp; Desarts. The south end of this regi<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>on<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> with the spacious <a id="l17"></a>country beyond it is Ethiopia. The middlemost tract is <a id="l18"></a>Thebais called in scripture the land of Pathros &amp; <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> the  rest <a id="l19"></a>  below Thebais was  westward from the city Berenices,  &amp; called Misraim. ✝✝ This tract was distinguished into to parts the lower  a broad &amp; flat country upon the mouths of Nile called Delta by the Greeks &amp;  Rahab in scripture the  higher a long &amp; narrow country called Heptanomis by the Greeks.  The metropolis of Thebais was Thebes called in scripture In the south end of Thebais <a id="l20"></a>between the Nile &amp; the red sea not far from Thebes was <a id="l21"></a>the City Coptus<sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup>   &amp; the <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Homies<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Coptites.

Probably the Coptites <a id="l25"></a>founded Thebes &amp; thereby spread their name with their <a id="l26"></a>dominion.</p>
<p id="par3">Sir Iohn Marsham reccons that Thebais was anciently <a id="l27"></a>divided into two kingdoms the one on the east side of the <a id="l28"></a>Nile under the head city Thebes  the other on the west <a id="l29"></a>side under the head city This, &amp; that Misraim or Egypt <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>below Th<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ebais was also anciently divided into two kingdoms the <a id="l30"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>lower<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> upon the seven streams of Nile &amp; the uper between that <a id="l31"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>&amp; T<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>hebais; both which were called Misraim in the dual number <a id="l32"></a> that is the two lands of Misor.

In The south end of Thebais And out of these four kingdoms <a id="l33"></a>&amp; perhaps some others at length arose the Monarchy of <a id="l34"></a>Egypt. But how these kingdoms at first arose out of <a id="l35"></a>smaller ones is hard to relate because of the great ~ <a id="l36"></a>antiquity of the kingdoms. Yet some footsteps there are <a id="l37"></a>of their first original.</p>
<p id="par4">For in the seven years of plenty Ioseph laid up the corn <a id="l38"></a>in the cities of Egypt, the corn of the field which was round about <a id="l39"></a>every city laid he up in the same. Gen. 41.48. And therefore the <a id="l40"></a>cities of Egypt being in those days the places which the Egyptians <a id="l41"></a>inned their harvest they must have been almost as close toge<a id="l42"></a>ther as our villages &amp; by consequence as numerous &amp; small <a id="l43"></a>as the ancient cities of Syria &amp; δήμοι of the Medes &amp; <a id="l44"></a>Greeks. Which is an argument that the first constitution of <a id="l45"></a>Egypt was like that of other nations round about. For these <a id="l46"></a>cities like the  δήμοι of Greece united under common <a id="l47"></a>councills &amp; thereby grew into kingdoms.</p>
<p id="par5">For the common councils of the Greeks were set up in <a id="l48"></a>imitation of those set up before in Egypt, &amp; the remains <a id="l49"></a>of such councils continued in several parts of Egypt till the <a id="l50"></a>days of Herodotus. <em class="underline">The Oracle</em>, saith he,<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> <em class="underline">at Dodona is very <a id="l51"></a>like that of the Egyptian Thebes &amp; the way of divin<a id="l52"></a>ing in the Greek Temples is taken from Ægypt. For <a id="l53"></a>the Egyptians were the first authors of making Conventi<a id="l54"></a>ons &amp; solemnities &amp; Councils &amp; the Greeks learnt these <a id="l55"></a>things from them. Of which thing I have this argument <a id="l56"></a>that their way was in use from ancient times but that <a id="l57"></a>of the Greeks lately instituted. Neither do the Egyptians <a id="l58"></a>assemble once every year but frequently, as in other places, <a id="l59"></a>so chiefly &amp; most studiously in the city Bubastis to the <a id="l60"></a>Honour of Diana, secondly in the city Busiris to the honour <a id="l61"></a>of Isis. In which city seated in the middle of the Egyp<a id="l62"></a>tian Delta is the greatest temple of Isis. Isis is she who <a id="l63"></a>in Greek is called Δημήτης that is Ceres. Thirdly in <a id="l64"></a>the city of Sais to the honour of Minerva. <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span> Fourthly in <a id="l65"></a>Heliopolis to the honour of the Sun.

<h2 id="hd2" class="cent"><span class="large">Chap. II<a id="l66"></a><br>Of the Kingdome of Egypt.</span></h2>
    
<p id="par7">Egypt (called in scripture Misor Mizraim &amp; the land of Ham) <a id="l81"></a>is a long &amp; broad valley or meadow on both sides the Nile between <a id="l82"></a>mountains &amp; desarts, running north &amp; south from Syene to the Me<a id="l83"></a>diterranean. It consists of two regions called Mizraim that is the <a id="l84"></a>two lands of Misor, videlicet the upper  lying on both sides the <a id="l85"></a>single stream of the Nile &amp; the lower lying upon the mouths of <a id="l86"></a>the Nile in the form of a triangle about 3600 furlongs in compass. <a id="l87"></a>This lower was called Delta by the Greeks &amp; Rahab in scripture. <a id="l88"></a> The upper was again <a id="l89"></a>divided into two parts the southern called Thebais &amp; in scripture <a id="l90"></a>the land of Pathros &amp; the northern called Heptanomis. The Metro<a id="l91"></a>polis of Thebais was Thebes called in Scripture Ammon No (now <a id="l92"></a>Minio) that is the city of Ammon or Iupiter or (as the seventy <a id="l93"></a>interpret) Diospolis. It stood on both sides the Nile at the distance <a id="l94"></a>of about 840 stadia below the less cataract. Below it on the <a id="l95"></a>western side of the Nile was the city This anciently the Me<a id="l96"></a>tropolis of a kingdom which at lenght came under the dominion <a id="l97"></a>of Thebes. The Metropolis of Heptanomis was Noph, Moph or <a id="l98"></a>Memphys a city on the western bank of the Nile just above the <a id="l99"></a>Delta &amp; about 1000 stadia from the Mediterranean. Not far from <a id="l100"></a>Memphys were the fields where the Egyptians buried their <a id="l101"></a>dead &amp; built Pyramids to their memory.</p>
<p id="par8">About half a mile or a mile below Memphys the Nile <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> began to divide it self into several streams to water the Delta <a id="l102"></a>The direct stream which runs through the middle of the Delta is <a id="l103"></a>called the Thermusiac river or Sebennic Ostium. The first <a id="l104"></a>stream which parts from it runs on the eastern side of the <a id="l105"></a>Delta &amp; is called the Bubastic River or Pelusiac ostium. The <a id="l106"></a>next stream which parts from it runs on the western side of <a id="l107"></a>the Delta &amp; is called the Canobic ostium. These are the <a id="l108"></a>three biggest streams &amp; between them run several others.</p>
<p id="par9">In the way from Syria into Egypt at the entrance of <a id="l109"></a>Egypt about three miles from the Sea &amp; at some distance from the <a id="l110"></a>Pelusiac ostium of the Nile eastward stood Pelusium called also <a id="l111"></a>Sin, Abaris, Sethron &amp; Pithom &amp; westward from it upon the <a id="l112"></a>bank of the same Pelusiac Ostium stood Ramesses. These were the <a id="l113"></a>two cities which the Israelites built for Pharaoth &amp; between them <a id="l114"></a>lay the land of Goshen where Israel was in bondage &amp; on <a id="l115"></a>the other side of this river was the field &amp; city of Zoan or <a id="l116"></a>Tanis, &amp; higher upon the eastern bank of the same stream not <a id="l117"></a>far below Memphys was Bubastis called in scripture Phibeseth. <a id="l118"></a>On the eastern border of Egypt about 1200 furlongs above <a id="l119"></a>Pelusium stood the city On, Aven or Heliopolis whose Priest Poti<a id="l120"></a>phera married his daughter Assenath to Ioseph. The way be<a id="l121"></a>tween these two cities was through a desart over which there <a id="l122"></a>was an open access from the east into Egypt till Sesostris fenced <a id="l123"></a>Egypt on that side with a great ditch of water carried from <a id="l124"></a>Pelusium to Heliopolis.</p>
<p id="par10">Between Egypt &amp; the Red Sea were nations of Arabians called <a id="l125"></a>Troglodytæ &amp; in scripture Sukkijm. And in Thebais between the <a id="l126"></a>Nile &amp; the Red Sea not far from Thebes was Coptus a common <a id="l127"></a>city of the Egyptians &amp; Arabians &amp; the Metropolis of the Nome <a id="l128"></a>Coptites. This people gave the name of Coptites to all the Egyp<a id="l129"></a>tians &amp; thence the Greeks formed ἆιαCopti, <em class="underline">Ægyptus</em>. Probably <a id="l130"></a>the Coptites founded Thebes &amp; thereby spread their name with <a id="l131"></a>their dominion. Yet Ægypt is often taken by writers  for Delta &amp; Heptanomis without Thebais, &amp; sometimes only for Delta.</p>
<p id="par11">About ten  thousand furlongs above the mouths <a id="l133"></a>of the Nile in the northern latitude of about 14 or 15 de<a id="l134"></a>grees stood the city Meroe in a great Island or Peninsula <a id="l135"></a>of the same name compassed by two arms of the Nile Asta<a id="l136"></a>boras &amp; Astapus or Astusapes flowing from certain Lakes <a id="l137"></a>&amp; meeting 700 furlongs below the City. Thence the Nile <a id="l138"></a>flowd northward 2000 furlongs more &amp; then bending back<a id="l139"></a>ward ran southwest 3700 furlongs till it came almost over <a id="l140"></a>against Meroe. Then it ran again to the north with some <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> inclination eastward 5300 stadia to the great Cataract <a id="l141"></a>&amp; from thence northward 700 stadia to the less Cataract <a id="l142"></a>&amp; from thence it ran northward in a right line through <a id="l143"></a>the middle of Egypt 5000 stadia to the Mediterranean <a id="l144"></a>Sea. These bendings of the Nile above the less Cateract together with the rivers which run into it seem to be therivers of Ethiopia Zephan. 3.1 &amp; Isa 18.1.</p>
<p id="par12">On the Arabic or eastern side of the Nile from the <a id="l145"></a>less cateract up to Meroe &amp; beyond it were the Arabic <a id="l146"></a>Ethiopians called Megabars &amp; Blemyes &amp; in Scripture <a id="l147"></a>Chus. Iuba makes them not Ethiopians but Arabians <a id="l148"></a>And over against them on the other side the Nile <a id="l149"></a>were the Nubians &amp; Abissenes called Lud. The Nubians were anci<a id="l150"></a>ently divided into little kingdomes under kings of their <a id="l151"></a>own, &amp; frequently warred with the Arabian Ethiopians <a id="l152"></a>for one anothers territories. The Megabar Ethiopians <a id="l153"></a>were next Egypt &amp; used bucklers &amp; lances &amp; clubs knotted <a id="l154"></a>with iron &amp; thereby differed from the other Ethiopians who <a id="l155"></a>used great bows &amp; lances. These Ethiopians were sometimes <a id="l156"></a>subject to Egypt &amp; sometimes reigned over it &amp; according<a id="l157"></a>ly the whole was called  sometimes Egypt &amp; <a id="l158"></a>sometimes Ethiopia.</p>

<p id="par14">Manetho an Egyptian Priest has given us the names <a id="l167"></a>of many kings reigning in several parts of Egypt, as at <a id="l168"></a>Elephantis, at Diospolis or Thebes, at Memphys, at Bubas<a id="l169"></a>tis, at Heracleapolis, at Tanis, at Sais, at Xois: &amp; Eratos<a id="l170"></a>thenes has also given us a list of the kings of Thebes. <a id="l171"></a> Which confirms that there have been many kingdoms in Egypt at once ~ as Palmonghtes &amp; the Chronicum Alexandrinum tell us there were.. But a certain account of <a id="l173"></a>their rise magnitude duration &amp; fall is not now to be had. <a id="l174"></a>Yet this is certain that before the reign of Sesac they <a id="l175"></a>were all swallowed up by the kingdom of Thebes.</p>
<p id="par15">In the days of Iacob &amp; Moses there was a kingdom in <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> the lower Egypt of a considerable bigness whose kings resided <a id="l176"></a>at Ramesses. For where Pharaoh &amp; his Court resided there <a id="l177"></a>Ioseph placed his father &amp; brethren that they might be near <a id="l178"></a>him (Gen. 45.10) not in the very city but in the territory adjoyn<a id="l179"></a>ing where their flocks &amp; heards might have pasturage  &amp; <a id="l180"></a>this was in the land of Ramesses (Gen 47.11) in Goshen which seems to be one of <a id="l181"></a>the villages of the city (Gen 46.29) so neare the city that <a id="l182"></a>Pharaohs daughter coming down to wash her self in the <a id="l183"></a>river &amp; walking along the river with her maids, found <a id="l184"></a>Moses hid  in the flaggs &amp; sent for a nurse of the Hebrew <a id="l185"></a>weomen staying till the nurse came to receive the child <a id="l186"></a>Exod. 2.3, 5, 7, 9. In that City Moses did his wonders in the <a id="l187"></a>sight of Pharaoh, Exod. 7.15, 20 &amp; 8.3, 20 &amp; 9.29, 33. And when <a id="l188"></a>the first born were smitten which was at midnight Phara<a id="l189"></a>oh rose up in the night &amp; called for Moses &amp; Aaron &amp; <a id="l190"></a>ordered them &amp; the people of Israel to get them out of <a id="l191"></a>the land, &amp; the same night the Egyptians lent the <a id="l192"></a>Israelites Iewels &amp; rayment &amp; urged them to be gone &amp; <a id="l193"></a>the next morning Moses &amp; Aaron led the children of <a id="l194"></a>Israel from Ramesses out of Egypt &amp; they journied <a id="l195"></a>that day with their flocks &amp; heards to Succoth a place <a id="l196"></a>in the wilderness between Egypt &amp; the Red Sea, Gen. 11.<a id="l197"></a>8 &amp; 12.29, 30, 31, 37, 38, 41. Num. 33.3. Ramesses was therefore <a id="l198"></a>the royal seat of this kingdom. But of what extent this <a id="l199"></a>kingdom was is uncertain. I suspect it comprehended but <a id="l200"></a>a part of the Delta.</p>
<p id="par16">The Kings of Ramesses are not mentioned by Manetho <a id="l201"></a>except Timaus the last king whom the Shepherds conquered. Nor <a id="l202"></a>did Manetho know any thing of the peregrination &amp; servitude <a id="l203"></a>of Israel in Egypt but takes the Shepherd's Kingdom for the Israelites, which makes me suspect that the kings in his Dynasties are <a id="l204"></a>generally later then the days of Moses. For he being a <a id="l205"></a>Priest of Heliopolis which was under the dominion of Ramesses <a id="l206"></a>it may be presumed that he would be most diligent &amp; particular in the antiquities of his own country, &amp; therefor would not have omitted the kings of Ramesses &amp; servitude of the Israelites had his records reacht so high.</p>
<p id="par17">The first &amp; second Dynasties of Manetho contain 17 Kings <a id="l207"></a>of This, the first of which is Menes accounted the oldest king in <a id="l208"></a>his Dynasties &amp; the 16<sup>th</sup> is Sesochris who reigned 48 years <a id="l209"></a>&amp;  [ἐῖχεν ὕψος <span class="overline">ε</span> πλάτος <span class="overline">γ</span>: <a id="l210"></a> read, ἐῖχεν ὕψος πυχῶν <span class="overline">ε</span> πλαιστῶν <span class="overline">γ</span>] was 5 cubits &amp; 3 palms high.</p>

<p id="par29">Erathosthenes has given us another list or canon of the kings of Thebes <a id="l267"></a>beginning with Menes,  &amp; conteining 38 kings.

<p id="par30">From all which it seems to me that in the Dynasties of Mane<a id="l280"></a>tho &amp; Eratosthenes there is nothing so ancient as the coming of Israel <a id="l281"></a>out of Egypt. And yet the Egyptian Priests by summing up the years of all the Dynasties together have made their kingdom much older then the creation of the world. which shews that they knew not when their kings reigned.</p>
<p id="par31">Africanus dates the reign of Menes (the first king of Thebes <a id="l282"></a>&amp; This ) from <a id="l283"></a>the tenth year of the reign of the Shepherds &amp; their reign began <a id="l284"></a>after the days of Moses.</p>
<p id="par32">Venaphes The fourth king of This built the Pyramids in Chocome <a id="l285"></a>&amp; Suphis the ninth king of Memphys built the great Pyramid &amp; the third Pyramid is ascribed to Nitocris &amp; certainly,  the Pyramids <a id="l286"></a>were built long after the days of Moses. Herodotus  from the report of the Egyptian Priests represents that they were built after the days of Sesostris, &amp; Some have attributed the third <a id="l287"></a>Pyramid to Rhodope the fellow servant of Æsop who lived in the age of <a id="l288"></a>Solon &amp; Cræsus.</p>
<p id="par33">In these Dynasties of Manetho &amp; Erastosthenes the kings seem to be often set out of order <a id="l289"></a>&amp; the names of the kings much corrupted  &amp; some of them were perhaps only Viceroys which makes it difficult <a id="l290"></a>to conclude any thing of certainty from them. </p>
<p id="par34">Sometime after the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt the <a id="l292"></a>Shepherds from the east invaded &amp; conquered Timaus king of the lower <a id="l293"></a>Egypt &amp; burnt the cities &amp; subverted the Temples of the Egyptians <a id="l294"></a>&amp; reduced the people into servitude &amp; reigning there a long <a id="l295"></a>time had various wars with the kings of  the higher parts of <a id="l296"></a>Egypt. This invasion I place after the departure of Israel out <a id="l297"></a>of Egypt because during their stay in Egypt there is no mention <a id="l298"></a>of Shepherds or Arabians or Canaanites there but  Pharaoh &amp; <a id="l299"></a>all his people are spoken of as Egyptians. The Israelites had been <a id="l300"></a>in Egypt 215 years &amp; yet remained a distinct people so as not <a id="l301"></a>to be called Egyptians &amp; the Shepherds remained also a distinct <a id="l302"></a>people because the  Egyptians at length drave them out of Gen.<a id="l303"></a>Egypt, The Egyptians abominated Shepherds &amp; would not so much as eat with them &amp; &amp; by way of distinction  <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> called their kings Hicsos that is <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> Shepherd kings &amp;  they differed also in religion the  Shepherds sacrificing <a id="l304"></a>men after the manner of the  Canaanites &amp; Arabians  whence came the <a id="l305"></a>story of Busiris,  but the Egyptians abolishing such sacrifices. But in the <a id="l306"></a>story of Moses, the king of Egypt under whom Israel was in bondage was called <a id="l307"></a>Pharaoh like  the old kings of Egypt &amp; he &amp; his captains &amp;  army &amp; all his people except the <a id="l308"></a>Israelites are considered as one nation &amp; called Egyptians without any distin<a id="l309"></a>ction. Pharaoh sought the life of Moses for killing an Egyptian <a id="l310"></a>(Exod 2.15) The Iews were in bondage under the Egyptians (Exod. 3.<a id="l311"></a>8, 9) The ten plagues fell on the Egyptians &amp; the Egyptians were <a id="l312"></a>drowned in the red sea. Not one word in all the story of any other <a id="l313"></a>people then Egyptians &amp; Israelites. And it is further to be observed <a id="l314"></a>that the worship of the calf which Israel brought out of Egypt <a id="l315"></a>was not that of the Canaanites or Arabians but that which the <a id="l316"></a>genuine Egyptians paid to their God Osiris. And Pharaoh feared <a id="l317"></a>least upon any incursion of forreigners Israel should help them <a id="l318"></a>&amp; go with them out of the land. And as shepherds were an abomina<a id="l319"></a>tion to the Egyptians in the days of Iacob so the sacrifices of ~ <a id="l320"></a>Shepherds were an abomination to the Egyptians in the days of <a id="l321"></a>Moses (Exod 10.9). It was after this time therefore that Egypt <a id="l322"></a>came under the dominion of the Shepherds.</p>
<p id="par35">These Shepherds, saith Manetho, first seated themselves in Egypt by power without <a id="l323"></a>warr, &amp; then  gaining the Princes of the region were they were they <a id="l324"></a>invaded the cities of Egypt with great violence &amp; reducing them into <a id="l325"></a>servitude at length made Salates their king. He took Memphys &amp;  &amp; built &amp; fortified Avavis or Pelusium <a id="l327"></a>strongly with a wall &amp;  numerous garison.  After him reigned successively Beon, <a id="l330"></a>Apacnas, Apophis, Ianias or Itaan, Assis or Arcles &amp; many others <a id="l331"></a> . In those days Ægypt was called Aeria    There was a Dynasty of the Gods of Egypt called Auritæ. <a id="l332"></a>&amp; probably the name came from the city  Avaris or Abaris  where the Shepherds reigned afterwards.  This city the Egyptians accounted the city of Typhon calling it Sethon from Seth a name of Typon The country about Avaris was <a id="l334"></a>long after the fall of this kingdom called Bucolica because the <a id="l335"></a>Shepherds there fed their Heards &amp; flocks.  They  reigned <a id="l336"></a>over Heliopolis &amp; there sacrificed men till one of the kings <a id="l337"></a>of Egypt whom Manetho calls Amosis having recoverd that <a id="l338"></a>city from them abolished those sacrifices there by  substituting waxen <a id="l339"></a>images of men  They  sacrificed men of the colour of Typhon at the  Tumb of Osiris which they called Busiris &amp; because few Ægyptians were of that collour they usually sacrificed strangers These sacrifices seem  to have been <a id="l341"></a>used in several cities &amp; perhaps in the Nome of Busiris in the middle of the Delta. For There <a id="l342"></a>the worshippers  also beat themselves &amp; some cut their <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> foreheads after the manner of the Phœnicians.  1 King. 18.28.

In Heliopolis the sacri<a id="l351"></a>ficed three men daily till one of the kings of Egypt whom Manetho <a id="l352"></a>calls Amosis having taken that city from them abolished those sacri<a id="l353"></a>fices by substituting waxen images of men. At length Misphragmuthosis <a id="l354"></a>king of Thebes – <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 10r resumes &gt; </span> At length Mis<a id="l355"></a>phragmuthosis king of Thebes drave them out of almost all <a id="l356"></a>Egypt &amp; made them retire into the city Abaris where they <a id="l357"></a>walled in then thousand acres of land &amp; shut themselves up <a id="l358"></a>&amp; his son &amp; successor Tuthmosis or Thummosis beseiged them there &amp; <a id="l359"></a> covenanted with them that they should leave Egypt &amp; <a id="l360"></a>go whether they pleased &amp; thereupon, saith Manetho, they <a id="l361"></a>went out of Egypt through the Desart into Syria. This </p>
<p id="par36">Hence Manetho concludes that they were the Israelites. <a id="l362"></a>Others take them for Arabians. Africanus speaking of <a id="l363"></a>the first six kings saith they were Phenicians, Ησαν δὲ <a id="l364"></a>Φοίνικες ξένοι βασιλεῖς στ. Bochartus makes them a <a id="l365"></a>colony of Phœnicians &amp; interprets the names of the first <a id="l366"></a>six kings in the Phœnician language. Herodotus tells us that in Memphys was a region which they called And Ierome saith of <a id="l367"></a>the language of Canaan,  <em class="underline">Inter Ægyptian &amp; Hebræan <a id="l368"></a>media est &amp; Hebrææ magna in parte confinis:</em> Its much like <a id="l369"></a>the Hebrew but partakes more of the Egyptian then the <a id="l370"></a>Hebrew doth. The Canaanites were shepherds &amp; lay next <a id="l371"></a>Egypt &amp; the main body of the Arabians lay at a greater <a id="l372"></a>distance from Egypt with Edom between. For Edom lay before <a id="l373"></a>Egypt <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> extending from Canaan to the red sea &amp; the Edomites kept <a id="l374"></a>their seats.</p>
<p id="par37">It seems to me therefore that as when David invaded <a id="l375"></a> Edom &amp; Nebuchadnezzar invaded Iudea the invaded people <a id="l376"></a>retired into Egypt so when Ioshua invaded Canaan &amp; drave <a id="l377"></a>out the inhabitants they retired in great numbers into Egypt <a id="l378"></a>  &amp; seated themselves about Avaris where <a id="l379"></a>they found pasturage for their cattel For Manetho says they came in peacably without war &amp; thence  its probable that they were fugitives.  But  when <a id="l380"></a>they found themselves numerous &amp; strong enough they  made warr upon <a id="l381"></a>Timaus king of the Egyptians (whom perhaps Ezekiel calls Tammur)  &amp; overthrew the kingdom of Ramesses <a id="l382"></a>&amp; staying long in Egypt used themselves to navigation <a id="l383"></a>upon the river Nile,  &amp; when they were shut up in Avaris <a id="l384"></a>applied themselves  more to the sea then before for want of room &amp; still <a id="l385"></a>more when they were obliged to leave Egypt, using both the Red <a id="l386"></a>Sea &amp; the Mediterranean, &amp; sending colonies into many places <a id="l387"></a>on both seas. For the Phœnicians  were seated upon <a id="l388"></a>both seas &amp; traded first upon the Red Sea &amp;  retired from thence <a id="l389"></a>to the Mediterranean as they themselves &amp; the Persians  <a id="l390"></a>related to Herodotus.

And by <a id="l399"></a>the name of the city this Venus seemes to be the  Venus  of the Phenicians called <a id="l400"></a> called Astarte Aster Asteroth Athara, Atergatis Derceto  The name denotes <a id="l402"></a>a Queen of Shepherds heardmen &amp; Mariners, the word Asteroth signifying  <a id="l403"></a> flocks of  sheep &amp; heards of cattel . As a queen of Sheepherds &amp; <a id="l404"></a>heardsmen she ware upon her head the  head of an Ox that is a diadem so <a id="l405"></a>formed, &amp; was called  Aster Asteroth  Astarte Athara, &amp; as a queen of Mariners she was sometimes formed like  a fish <a id="l406"></a>below &amp; the (from the word <em class="underline">dag</em> a fish) called  Atergatis  Aterbechis Derceto &amp;c. <a id="l407"></a> the  names being corruptly formed of Aster-dag. <a id="l408"></a> When any Bulls <a id="l409"></a>died in Egypt it was a custome of the Egyptians to bury them  neare their cities with <a id="l410"></a>one or two horns above  ground for a Signe &amp;  after a certain time when <a id="l411"></a>their bodies were  rotted away the inhabitants of the city  Atarbechis came to the <a id="l412"></a>cities  of Egypt in ships,  dug up the bones  carried them away to a <a id="l413"></a>common burying place &amp; there buried them  together. This service imposed <a id="l414"></a>by the Egyptians upon the inhabitants of  this city intimates that   they were the  remains of ancient heardsmen who had left  a brood of cattel  <a id="l416"></a> scattered throughout  the land of Egypt, &amp; the Goddess which they worshipped <a id="l417"></a> discovers that they were Phœnicians. So also the head of Osiris carried yearly <a id="l418"></a>out of Egypt to Biblos in Syria &amp; the Syrians lamenting  Adonis after the manner <a id="l419"></a>that the Egyptians did Osiris are arguments that the Phœnicians brought part of <a id="l420"></a>their religion out of Egypt.</p>

<p id="par40" class="i0">Lucian<sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> tells us that there was  a large Temple at Sidon dedicated to Astarte &amp; that the Phœniceans had  another  Temple which was not Syrian <a id="l421"></a>but Egyptian &amp; came from Heliopolis into Syria &amp; was large &amp; very <a id="l422"></a>ancient. And that at Biblos they had another large Temple dedicated to <a id="l423"></a>Venus where they worshipped Adonis &amp; every year beat themselves &amp; lamented his death  <a id="l424"></a> throughout the whole region &amp; then  performed to him <a id="l425"></a>a sacrifice of the dead &amp; the next day afirmed he was alive &amp; shaved <a id="l426"></a>their heads after the manner of the Egyptians when their Apis was <a id="l427"></a>dead. And some of Biblos affirmed that the Egyptian the Egyptian Osiris was buried <a id="l428"></a> at Biblos &amp; that all this mourning was performed to Osiris &amp; <a id="l429"></a>confirm their opinion by this ceremony that the head of Osiris  was every year brought out of Egypt to Biblos in <a id="l431"></a>a ship, &amp;  saith Lucian I saw this head formed of the Egyptian papyr.</p>
<p id="par41" class="i0">&amp;  that he was buried  at Biblos &amp; confirmed their opinion by <a id="l432"></a>this ceremony that – papyr. This custome it seems they took to be in remembrance <a id="l433"></a>of  the bringing of the true head  of Osiris out of Egypt to be <a id="l434"></a>buried at Biblus &amp; upon that opinion grounded their worship   So then Adonis Venus <a id="l435"></a>&amp; the Boar  are but other names of Osiris Isis &amp; Typhon <a id="l436"></a>&amp; the worship of Adonis &amp; his Venus   is Egyptian.  All which are fur<a id="l437"></a>ther arguments that the  Phenicians came from Egypt. And its <a id="l438"></a>probable also that they  brought their Hercules  <a id="l439"></a>thence.</p></div>

<p id="par44">In The kingdom where Israel was in servitude  are mentioned  these <a id="l475"></a> Cities Pithom, Ramesses, On &amp; Zoan.  Gen 41.45. Exod 1.11. Psal. Pithom was a city at the <a id="l476"></a>Entrance of Egypt in the way from Syria about three miles from the sea . It was otherwise called Sethron, Abaris, Sin &amp; Pelusium,   On  or  Aven was Heliopolis a City  in the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011v"> &lt;11v&gt; </span> eastern border of Egypt about  1500 furlongs above Pelusium.  . The way between them  was  over a desert through which there was an open access from the east <a id="l481"></a>into Egypt untill Sesach fenced Egypt on that side with a great ditch <a id="l482"></a>of water, carried from Pelusium to Heliopolis.   Almost Parallel to <a id="l483"></a>this ditch ran the eastern stream of  the Nile called the  <a id="l484"></a>Bubastic river  or Pelusiotic ostium, &amp;  on the western side of this stream lay the  country or <a id="l485"></a>   of Tanis or Zoan an ancient City which was built seven years after Hebron  (Num 13.22) &amp;  at length became the royal seat of the lower Egypt.. These three cities were the Metropolise of <a id="l486"></a> three Nomes the Sethroite, the Heliopolitan &amp; the Tanite. Vpon the  eastern <a id="l487"></a>bank of the  Bubastic river was Pharaohs court   &amp; the city Ramesses  &amp; between  <a id="l489"></a>Pithom &amp; Ramesses lay the  land of Goshen  For Pithom &amp; Ramesses were cities of treasure (that is fortified cities) <a id="l493"></a>which the Children of Israel built for Pharaoh (Exod. 1.11) &amp; therefore were seated in or <a id="l494"></a>neare the land  when Israel dwelt And that land was in the  territory or country of Ramessis <a id="l495"></a>(Gen 47.11) bordering upon the River (Exod 1.22 &amp; 2.3 , 8) &amp; in the way from Syria <a id="l496"></a> to Pharaoh's court (Gen 46.28, 29) And Pharaohs court was  seated upon <a id="l497"></a>the same bank of the River  in the border of the land of Goshen (Exod 2.5. &amp; 7.15, 20. &amp; 8.20)  or so neare  to that land that Ioseph (the second man in <a id="l499"></a>Egypt) upon notice given by his brother Iudah went thence to meet his <a id="l500"></a>father in Goshen (Gen 46.28, 29) &amp; that when the first born of the Egyptians were slain at <a id="l501"></a>midnight, Pharaoh sent for Moses &amp; Aaron &amp; by their hand  <a id="l502"></a>sent away the children of Israel the sane night &amp; they prepared <a id="l503"></a>for their journey &amp; borrowed Iewels &amp; rayment of the Egyptians the <a id="l504"></a>same night &amp; in the morning under the conduct of Moses &amp; Aaron <a id="l505"></a>began their journey from Ramesses the city which they had been <a id="l506"></a>building &amp; journied that day to Succoth a place in the desart where they baked cakes of unleavened bread. (Exod 12.29, 31, 37 &amp; Num 33.2.) From all which  it may seem that Pharaoh then resided  in the City Ramesses, tho   Zoan became afterwards the royal city of the lower Egypt  Psal. 78.12, 43 Isa 19.11, 13 &amp; 30.4. </p>
