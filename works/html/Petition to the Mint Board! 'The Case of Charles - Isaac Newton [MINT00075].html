    <p id="par4" class="right"><span class="larger">The Case of Charles Stuart one of the Monyers</span> <span class="large">belonging</span>
    <a id="l2"></a><br><span class="larger">to Her Majesties Mint in the Tower of London.</span></p>
    
    <p id="par5" class="i0"><span class="largest">Whereas</span> by the Laws and Custome of the Mint it is Provided, that the Monyers belonging to her Majesties Mint in the <a id="l3"></a>Tower of London, shall take Apprentices, and instruct them in the Art and Mystery of Coining, to the end there may be never wanting a <a id="l4"></a>sufficient number of able and skilfull workmen to performe the service of the Mint.</p>
    
    <p id="par6"><span class="large">And Whereas</span> Charles Stuart having for the term of Seven Years served the Monyers as an Apprentice, and during the time of <a id="l5"></a>recoining the Old Money performing the duty of an Apprentice, with all the Faithfulness and Diligence that such a time especially required: <a id="l6"></a>at the expiration of Seven Years Apprentiship, he was by the Provost and Society of Monyers admitted into the Fellowship of Monyers and in <a id="l7"></a>this capacity has constantly attended the service of the Mint for almost Eight Years.</p>
    
    <p id="par7"><span class="large">But</span> some Years before his being made a Monyer, the Provost with the rest of the Monyers thought good to draw up certain Articles of <a id="l8"></a>Agreement for the better preservation of Society and good order among themselves, and whereby they obliged themselves, if they broke any of these Articles <a id="l9"></a>to pay some little forfeiture, the very highest of which was forty shillings: and seeing these Articles had no other end or tendency, than to keep up <a id="l10"></a>peace and good order in the Society, the said Charles Stuart when he was made a Monyer gave his consent to these Articles; and by these Rules thus <a id="l11"></a>voluntarily agreed to, the whole society has bin kept in mutual love and peace, for many years, till about two Years and a half ago New Iealousies broke <a id="l12"></a>out among them upon a very small occasion.</p>
    
    <p id="par8"><span class="large">The Honourable</span> the Master Worker sending for the Provost to know the charge of coining Copper Farthings, and they not agreeing together upon <a id="l13"></a>the price, the said Provost came back full of Iealousy of the Master Worker, apprehending that he had a design to make a separate contract with some of <a id="l14"></a>the Monyers only that were willing to coin the Copper cheaper, and to exclude the rest. To defeat the Master Worker in his suspected design, this <a id="l15"></a>expedient was resolv'd upon by the Provost and the Monyers, To draw up a body of Laws in which the Old Articles should be inserted, with ye addition <a id="l16"></a>of several New ones; particularly one, and for the sake of which all ye rest were made, is to prevent the making any separate Contract; and an <a id="l17"></a>augmentation of the Penalty, from forty shillings which was the highest sanction of the Old Articles, to Five Hundred Pounds or any one <a id="l18"></a>that shou'd dare to act against any of these Laws.</p>
    
    <p id="par9"><span class="large">When</span> this Project was mov'd first, the said Charles Stuart was surpriz'd to see how well it was receiv'd by a great part of the Monyers <a id="l19"></a>and therefore he desir'd em to consider well on what they did, and whether it was safe for them to enter into such a Combination: but notwithstan<a id="l20"></a>ding all he said, these Laws were form'd, and every Monyer was required to sign em; but when it came to the turn of the said Charles Stuart, he <a id="l21"></a>declined setting his hand to any such Laws till he was better inform'd of their right and power to make them: Little was said to him upon his <a id="l22"></a>refusing it, for fear, as he imagin'd, talking too much upon the subject before all had sign'd might move some other to stand out: and therefore <a id="l23"></a>the Matter rested so above a Year.</p>
    
    <p id="par10"><span class="large">But</span> last Lady day was twelvemonth it was taken up again. When the Provost told the said Charles Stuart to his greate Surprize, <a id="l24"></a>that the Salary which he and the rest of the Monyers enjoy by an Act of Parliament in that behalfe, and which by <span class="large">Your Honours</span> care is paid <a id="l25"></a>as punctually, he the Provost would deprive the said Charles Stuart of till set he his hand to these New Laws; then the said Charles Stuart <a id="l26"></a>desir'd to have a Copie of the Laws that he might consider em; which allso was refus'd him, telling him he might read em himselfe, but they <a id="l27"></a>could not permit a copie of em to go abroad.</p>
    
    <p id="par11"><span class="large">But nothwithstanding</span> this hard usage, of being deny'd a Copie of their Laws to consider before he sign'd em, and of <a id="l28"></a>having a whole Years Salary stopt in the hands of the Provost for not signing em, the said Charles Stuart has constantly attended the service <a id="l29"></a>of the Mint all along, and had he bin inclin'd by such strange treatment to neglect it, as he never was, yet as often as there was occasion, they <a id="l30"></a>called upon him to come to work, who were most zealous in refusing to pay him for his work; and for all that he constantly obeyd their call, <a id="l31"></a>tho as constantly as he applied himself to the Provost for his Salary, and the wages of so many days work he possitively refused to pay him either.</p>
    
    <p id="par12"><span class="large">At</span> last this Proposal was made to the said Charles Stuart, that he should bring a proper Iudge to consider their Laws and <a id="l32"></a>both sides shou'd agree to abide by his Iudgment, If he aprov'd of em, then the said Charles Stuart shou'd be oblig'd to sign em; if he disapprov'd <a id="l33"></a>of em they shou'd be bound to cancell em; this Proposall the said Charles Stuart through his natural desire of peace accepted of; and accordingly Council <a id="l34"></a>was freed to read and examine these Laws, which being done the Council attended the Monyers at their next meeting, and gave his Iudgment <a id="l35"></a>against their Laws telling em among other things, that by the Charter and Indenture of ye Mint, the only Laws which they shou'd follow, the <a id="l36"></a>Monyers have no power to make New Laws, or even to punish the breakers of the old, that being given into the hands of none but the Warden <a id="l37"></a>the Master worker and comptroller who are empow'rd to punish all Offenders, whether the Provost the Fellows or their Apprentices <a id="l38"></a>as in reason and justice they shall think fit for her Majesties service according to the Antient Power and Authority of Right thereunt belonging: Whereas in this <a id="l39"></a>Case of Charles Stuart the Monyers have assumed a power even of making New Laws, and forcing all their Fellow Monyers to consent to em, and punishing the Refusers <a id="l40"></a>in a very extraordinary Manner, to Deprive a man of a salary granted him by the Authority of Queen and Parliament and yet employ him in the Service for which that <a id="l41"></a>Salary is granted : this and a great deale more the Council urg'd; that it wou'd be the safest way to Cancell their Laws, and be contented with the Old Laws of the Mint <a id="l42"></a>and the Powers Lodged with the Great Officers: And tho it was their own Proposal, they wou'd not keep to it, but insisted upon their former terms of the <a id="l43"></a>said Charles Stuart signing or no Salary: upon which ye Council advised the said Charles Stuart to make a demand of the Yearly Salary and other <a id="l44"></a>mony of his which they had in their hands, and he accordingly did demand it, and they peremtority refus'd to pay: the Regard which the said Charles Stuart bears <a id="l45"></a>to the Monyers and his Vnwillingnes to make any complaints against them to your <span class="large">Honours</span>, would have gone a great way towards bringing him to comply <a id="l46"></a>with 'em almost in anything tho nere so inconvenient provided it was Lawful.</p>
    
    <p id="par13"><span class="large">But</span> the said Charles Stuart has since bin assured by his Council that he can't set his hand to the Laws of ye Monyers Enacting, without doing the highest <a id="l47"></a>Injury to ye Officers, and Divesting the Warden the Master Worker and Comptroller of ye Powers which both Charter and Indenture of the Mint, they are justly <a id="l48"></a>possessed of, He therefore witholds the said Charles Stuart from setting his hand to these Laws; by these reasons following: 1<sup>st</sup>: Because ye Company of Monyers is <a id="l49"></a>but a part of the Corporation, the Warden the Master Worker and the Comptroller being the other more considerable part: 2<sup>d</sup>: Because one part of a <a id="l50"></a>Corporation has not a Power to make Laws without ye knowledge of ye other: 3<sup>d</sup>: Because the Power of punishing ties not in the hands of the Monyers <a id="l51"></a>where these New Laws wou'd Lodge it, but only in the hands of the superior Officers of ye Mint: 4<sup>thly</sup>: Even by these New Laws of their if the said Charles <a id="l52"></a>Stuart has done any thing that forfeits his Salary, the Monyers are bound to acquaint the Superior Officers with it that they may punish as <a id="l53"></a>their wisdom think fit. <span class="large">And</span> 5<sup>thly</sup>: the Right or Interest of this Corporation is so far from being consulted in this Case, that by these New Laws <a id="l54"></a>that one part of ye Corporation Combines against the other; and whoever sets his hand to em enters into a Confederacy against ye Officers, for this <a id="l55"></a>was the first design of making these New Laws and this is the end they tend to.</p>
    
    <p id="par14"><span class="large">For</span> these reasons among many others the said Charles Stuart is advised by his Council by no means to enter into <a id="l56"></a>such a Combination and as he is so great a sufferer upon that account, to lay his Case before <span class="large">Your Honours</span> where it <a id="l57"></a>ought to Lye and where he is sure to find Iustice.</p>
