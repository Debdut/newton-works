<span class="pagenumber" id="p001r"> &lt;1r&gt; </span>
<p id="par1">On thursday Novem. 11<sup>th</sup> at a meeting of the R.S. A   small Tract was delivered to me as a present from M<sup>r</sup>  <a id="l1"></a>William Chevalier the sonn a bookseller at Paris, a person unknown to me,  entituled Abrege de Chronologie de M. Chavalier Newton, fait par lui meme &amp; <a id="l3"></a>traduit sur le Manuscrit Anglais. And the Bookseller hath  premised an adver<a id="l4"></a>tisement  in which he endeavours to defend himself for printing it without my leave saying that he  writ <a id="l5"></a>three letters to me for my leave &amp; in the third had told me that he would take my silence <a id="l6"></a>for a consent, &amp; that he had also charged one of his friends at London to speak to me &amp; <a id="l7"></a>procure my precise answer. And that having long expected my answer, he thought <a id="l8"></a>that he might take my silence for  a sort of consent, &amp; so  procured a Privilege &amp; printed it, &amp; then received my answer <a id="l10"></a>from his friend which was as follows.</p>
<p id="par2"><em class="underline">I remember that I wrote a Chronologic Index for a particular friend on <a id="l11"></a>condition that it should not be communicated. As I have not seen the Manuscript <a id="l12"></a>which you have under my name, I know not whether it is the same. That which I wrote <a id="l13"></a>was not at all done with designe to publish it. I designe not to medle with the printing <a id="l14"></a>of that which hath been given you under my name, nor to give any consent to <a id="l15"></a>the publishing of it. I am your very humble servant Isaac Newton. London. 27 May <a id="l16"></a>1725. Stylo vetero</em>.</p>
<p id="par3">This was the 6<sup>t</sup> of Iune new style &amp; the Privilege was Registred the day before.  granted Iune 1<sup>st</sup> &amp; registred Iune 8 &amp; the chronological Index printed of before he received my letter of Iune 6<sup>t</sup>, &amp; yet not  sent to me till  the time of election of a new President was at hand.  The <a id="l17"></a>Bookseller knew that  I had not seen the translation <a id="l18"></a>of this Chronological  Index &amp; without seeing it could give no consent to the impression, <a id="l19"></a>he knew that the translator was unknown to me &amp; was my  adversary &amp; therefore knew <a id="l20"></a>that it was not fit that I should give my consent nor be asked to doe it, he knew <a id="l21"></a>that the translator had   written a confutation of the  <a id="l22"></a> paper translated &amp; that this confutation was to be printed at the end of it <a id="l23"></a>&amp; told me nothing of  all this &amp; yet asked my consent to print it.</p>
<p id="par4">After the recital of my letter he adds: <em class="underline">M<sup>r</sup> Newton allows that he did write <a id="l24"></a>a chronological Index for a particular friend</em>. And perhaps this acknowledgment <a id="l25"></a>induced him to print my letter. He adds further <em class="underline">that the author of the translation &amp; <a id="l26"></a>of the observations upon it pretends to have an entire certainty that this</em>  <a id="l27"></a><a id="l28"></a><em class="underline">Index or Abridgement of Chronology is the same thing with the writing owned by M<sup>r</sup> Newton; &amp; the <a id="l29"></a>same author is perswaded that the Manuscript which hath been communicated <a id="l30"></a>to him hath been copied from that of this friend</em>, that is  from the MS of the particular <a id="l31"></a>friend above mentioned for whome I wrote it &amp; whom the author of the translation <a id="l32"></a> in the beginning of his Observations calls a great Princess. And therefore the MS which hath been communicated to him is that of Senior Conti copied from that of  this Princess.  A few days after <a id="l33"></a>I had given it to this Princess, her  Highness asked my leave that Senior Conti might <a id="l34"></a>have a copy. He knew that it was a secret &amp; that it was by her intercession &amp; my leave that he had a <a id="l35"></a>copy &amp; yet without  either her leave or mine he dispersed copies all over France, &amp; got an antiquary <a id="l36"></a>to translate &amp; confute it, &amp; the antiquary has got a Printer to print  the trans<a id="l37"></a>lation with the confutation. And the Printer wrote to me for my consent to the printing &amp;  pretends that he had  my consent because I <a id="l38"></a> delayed to answer his letters till he began to print, &amp; by my silence  gave consent to the printing it with a confutation <a id="l39"></a>at its first appearing in publick. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the left margin &gt; </span>as if any man could be so foolish as to consent to the printing of his papers with a confutation  annexed at their first <a id="l40"></a>appearance in publick.</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 1r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par5">The translator neare the end of his Observations  pag. 90,  saith: <em class="underline">I <a id="l41"></a>beleive that I have said enough concerning the Epoque of the Argonauts &amp; the value of <a id="l42"></a>generations, so that I may reserve what might be said against the rest. For these are <a id="l43"></a>the two foundations of all this new systeme of Chronology</em>. What he saith concerning <a id="l44"></a>the Epoque of the Argonauts is  founded on the  supposition that I place the Equinox in the time of the Argonautic Expedition 15 degrees <a id="l45"></a>from the first start of Aries. Which is a mistake.  I place the Equinox in the time of the Argonautic Expedition not 15 degrees <a id="l47"></a>after the first starr of Aries nor 15 degrees before the last star called ultima caudæ <a id="l48"></a> but  in the Colurus which passeth through the middles of the  constellations of Aries &amp; Libra &amp; is at <a id="l49"></a>right angles with the Colurus which passeth through the middles of the constellations of <a id="l50"></a><span class="ns">♋</span> &amp; <span class="ns">♑</span>. And I do in such a manner as was done by  Eudoxus who was contemporary to Meton &amp; Thucidides &amp; Xerxes King of Persia. And as for the value of generations, he saith that I value them one with <a id="l51"></a>another at 18 or 20 yeares a piece: (pag 52) which is another mistake. For I  agree with the <a id="l52"></a>ancients in valuing three generations at about an hundred years. But the reigns of <a id="l53"></a>kings I do not equal to generations as the ancient Greeks &amp; Egyptians did, but I value <a id="l54"></a>them only at about 18 or 20 years a piece, when ten or twelve kings  or above are taken <a id="l55"></a>together in continuall succession. So then the Translator has mistaken my meaning in the <a id="l56"></a>two main arguments on which the whole is founded, &amp; has undertaken to translate &amp; con<a id="l57"></a>fute a paper which he did not understand, &amp; been zealous to publish it though he thought it good for <a id="l58"></a>nothing but to expose me.</p>

<p id="par8" class="i30"><sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup>And I do it in such a manner <a id="l73"></a>as was done by Eudoxus, who flourished in the times of the Persian Empire  before the <a id="l74"></a>precession of the Equinox was discovered, &amp;  in describing the ancient sphere <a id="l75"></a> names the first starrs through which the Coluri passed.</p>
<br><br>
<p id="par9"><sup>1</sup> The translator grants that the Constellations were formed by Chiron p. 70, 71, 79. <a id="l76"></a><sup>2</sup> &amp; that the  solstices &amp; Equinoxes were then in the 15<sup>th</sup> degres of the Constellations (p. 65, 69, 75 <a id="l77"></a>4 &amp; that Eudoxus in his Enoptron or Speculum cited by Hipparchus followed this opinion (p. 62, 63, 65 69, 79 <a id="l78"></a>3 &amp; that this recconing was long preserved amongst the Greeks for  regulating the time <a id="l79"></a>of their publick feasts &amp; sacrifices, p. 64 <span class="hspac-n" title="7 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <sup>5</sup> but in his Calendar made for the <a id="l80"></a>use of country people he &amp; Meton placed the solstices &amp; equinoxes in the <a id="l81"></a>eighth degrees of the signes &amp; made no other alteration in the rustic Calender <a id="l82"></a>then to add his Cycle of 19 years with the intercalations belonging thereto <a id="l83"></a>for making the solstices return on the same  time of the year (p 65 <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>)  <a id="l84"></a> And that Meton observed the height of the sun in the solstice in the 432 yeare before the birth of Christ, p.64 And Hipparchus names the starrs through which the Colures passed in the <a id="l87"></a>ancient Sphere of Chiron described by  Eudoxus. And I find that these <a id="l88"></a>Colures passed through the middles of the Constellations of <span class="ns">♈</span> <span class="ns">♎</span> <span class="ns">♋</span> &amp; <span class="ns">♑</span> <a id="l89"></a>not 15<sup>gr</sup> but 7<sup>gr.</sup> 23′ <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> the first star of <span class="ns">♈</span>. &amp; from all this inferr that these were the Colures in the time of the Argo<a id="l90"></a>nautic Expedition &amp; had gone back from the 15<sup>th</sup> to the 8<sup>th</sup> degrees of those <a id="l91"></a> Constellations in the days of Meton; &amp; because they go back one degree in 72 years &amp; <a id="l92"></a>seven degrees in 504, that the Argonautic Expedition was therefore 504 years ancienter <a id="l93"></a>then the  days of Meton, or there about &amp; by consequence about  45  yeers after <a id="l94"></a>the  death of Solomon. But the translator affirms that I place the Equinox <a id="l95"></a>15 degrees after the first star of Aries &amp; by consequence that the  Argonautic Expedition was  532 years older then I  make <a id="l97"></a>it.</p>
<p id="par10">But he is mistaken.  The first &amp; last star of Aries are not 30 degrees distant from one another The translator grants that the Constellations were formed by Chiron p. 70, 71, <a id="l98"></a>79, &amp; that the Solstices were then in the    middles of the Constellations p. 65 <a id="l99"></a>69, 75, <span class="hspac-n" title="4 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; that Eudoxus in his Enoptron or Speculum cited by Hipparchus followed this opinion p.62, 63, 65, 69, 79 <a id="l100"></a>And Hipparchus names the starrs through which the Coluri passed in this old sphere &amp; <a id="l101"></a> thereby places the Colure of the solstices  about 7<sup>gr</sup> 24′ from the first <a id="l102"></a>starr of Aries, &amp; I follow him. But the translator represents that I place this <a id="l103"></a>Colure 15 degrees from the first starr of Aries &amp; thence  deduces that I should have made the Argonautic <a id="l104"></a>Expedition 532 years ancienter then I do.</p>
<p id="par11">He represents that I have a great work to come out,  but I never told him so. <a id="l105"></a>When I lived at Cambridge, untill the times of the Convention Parliament, History &amp; Chronology were one of the studies with which I <a id="l106"></a>refresht my self when I was weary of other studies: but I made nothing of that kind <a id="l107"></a>ready for the press.</p>
<p id="par12">He represents that I make the canicular cycle of the Egyptians begin in spring 884 <a id="l108"></a>years before the birth of Christ, though it never began in spring.

<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">An account of the Observations upon the <a id="l116"></a>Chronology <a id="l117"></a><br>of S<sup>r</sup> I. Newton.</h2>
<p id="par15">On thursday Novemb. 11<sup>th</sup> 1725 Old Style a small Tract  printed in French was delivered to me <a id="l118"></a>as a present from M<sup>r</sup> William Chevelier junior a Bookseller at Paris a person un<a id="l119"></a>known to me, entituled; <em class="underline">Abrege de Chronology de M. Chevalier Newton fait par lui meme, <a id="l120"></a>&amp; traduit sur le Manuscript Anglois.</em> And the Bookseller hath premised an advertisment <a id="l121"></a>to defend himself for printing it without my leave, saying that he had writ three let<a id="l122"></a>ters to me for my leave, &amp; in the third had told me that he would take my silence <a id="l123"></a>for a consent; &amp; that he had also charged one of his friends in London to speak to <a id="l124"></a>me &amp; procure my express answer; &amp; that having long expected my answer, he <a id="l125"></a>thought that he might take my silence for a sort of consent; &amp; so procured a <a id="l126"></a>Privilege, &amp; printed it, &amp; then received my answer from his friend, which was as follows.</p>
<p id="par16"><em class="underline">I remember that I wrote a Chronological Index for a particular friend on <a id="l127"></a> condition that it should not be communicated. As I have not seen the <a id="l128"></a>Manuscript which you have under my name, I know not whether it be the same. That <a id="l129"></a>which I wrote was not at all done with designe to publish it. I intend not to meddle with <a id="l130"></a>that which hath been given you under my name, nor to give any consent to the <a id="l131"></a>publishing of it. I am Your very humble servant Isaac Newton. London. 27 May. <a id="l132"></a>1725 stylo vetero</em>.</p>
<p id="par17">The Privilege was granted May 21 &amp; registred May 25 old style &amp; my <a id="l133"></a>letter dated May 27, &amp; the Chronological Index or Abridgement, as he calls it, <a id="l134"></a>printed before the arrival of my letter at Paris, &amp; kept ever since to be pub<a id="l135"></a>lished at a convenient time. The Bookseller knew that I had not seen the <a id="l136"></a>translation of the Abridgement &amp; without seing it could not in reason give my <a id="l137"></a>consent to the impression. He knew that the translator was unknown to me, &amp; was <a id="l138"></a>against me, &amp; therefore he knew that it was not fit that I should give my <a id="l139"></a>consent nor be asked to do it. He knew that the translator had written a confu<a id="l140"></a>tation of the paper translated, &amp; that this  confutation under the title of <a id="l141"></a>Observations was to be printed at the end of it; &amp; he told me nothing of all this, nor <a id="l142"></a>so much as the name of the Observator; &amp; yet asked my consent to the publishing: <a id="l143"></a>as if any man could be so foolish as to consent to the publishing of an unseen <a id="l144"></a>translation of his papers, made by an unknown person, with a confutation annexed <a id="l145"></a>&amp; unanswered, at their first appearance in publick.</p>
<p id="par18">After the recital of my Letter he adds that the author of the translation <a id="l146"></a>&amp; of the Observations upon it, pretends to have an entire certainty that this Index <a id="l147"></a>or Abridgement of Chronology is the same with the writing owned by me in my <a id="l148"></a>letter, &amp; is persuaded that the Manuscript which hath been communicated to him, hath <a id="l149"></a>been copied from that of this friend, that is, from that of the particular friend above <a id="l150"></a>mentioned in my letter. And therefore the manuscript which hath been communicated <a id="l151"></a>to him is that of Abbe Conti, a Venetian now at Paris of a noble family. He being about <a id="l152"></a>seven years ago in England gave me notice that the friend above mentioned desired <a id="l153"></a>to speak with me. And this friend then desired a copy of what I had written about <a id="l154"></a>Chronology. I replied that it was imperfect &amp; confused: but in a few days I could <a id="l155"></a>draw up an extract thereof if it might be kept secret: And sometime after I had <a id="l156"></a>done this &amp; presented it, this friend desired that Abbe Conti might have a copy <a id="l157"></a>of it. He was the only person who had a copy, &amp; he knew that it was a secret, &amp; <a id="l158"></a>that it was at the desire of this friend &amp; by my leave that he had a copy, &amp; he <a id="l159"></a>kept it secret while he staid in England: &amp; yet without either this friends leave <a id="l160"></a>or mine he dispersed copies of it in France, &amp; got an Antiquary to translate it <a id="l161"></a>into French &amp; to confute it, &amp; the Antiquary hath got a Printer to print the trans<a id="l162"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003v"> &lt;3v&gt; </span>lation &amp; the confutation, &amp; the Printer hath endeavoured to get my leave to print <a id="l163"></a>the translation without sending me a copy thereof to be perused, or telling me the <a id="l164"></a>name of the translator, or letting me know his designe was to print it with <a id="l165"></a>a confutation unanswered &amp; unknown to me.</p>
<p id="par19">The Translator neare the end of his Observation (pag. 90) saith: I believe <a id="l166"></a>that I have said enough concerning the <em class="underline">Epoque</em> of the Argonauts &amp; the length of <a id="l167"></a><em class="underline">Generations</em> to make people cautious about the rest. For those are the two foun<a id="l168"></a>dations of all this new systeme of chronology.</p>
<p id="par20">What he saith concerning the <em class="underline">Epoque</em> of the Argonauts is founded on the <a id="l169"></a>supposition that I place the Equinox in the time of the Argonautic expedition <a id="l170"></a>fifteen degrees from the first starr of Aries, pag. 75, 79. I place it in the middle <a id="l171"></a>of the constellation &amp; the middle of the constellation is not fifteen degrees from the <a id="l172"></a>first starr of Aries. The Observator grants that the Constellations were formed <a id="l173"></a>by Chiron (pag. 70, 71, 79,) &amp; that the solstices &amp; Equinoxes were then in the mid<a id="l174"></a>dles of the Constellations (pag. 65, 69, 75,) &amp; that <em class="underline">Eudoxus</em> in his <em class="underline">Enoptron</em> or <a id="l175"></a><em class="underline">speculum</em> cited by <em class="underline">Hipparchus</em> followed this opinion, pag. 62, 63, 65, 69, 79. And <a id="l176"></a><em class="underline">Hipparchus</em> names the starrs through which the Colures passed in this old sphere <a id="l177"></a>according to <em class="underline">Eudoxus</em>, &amp; thereby places the equinoctial Colure about 7<sup>degr.</sup>36′ <a id="l178"></a>from the first star of Aries: &amp; I follow <em class="underline">Hipparchus</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Eudoxus</em>. But the <a id="l179"></a>Observator represents that I place the Colure fifteen degrees from the first <a id="l180"></a>star of Aries, &amp; thence deduces that I should have made the Argonautic expe<a id="l181"></a>dition 532 years earlier then I do. Let him rectify his mistake, &amp; the <a id="l182"></a>Argonautic expedition will be where I place it.</p>
<p id="par21">And as for the length of <em class="underline">generations</em>, he saith that I reccon them one with <a id="l183"></a>another at 18 or 20 years a piece (pag. 52, 59:) which is another mistake. I <a id="l184"></a>agree with the ancients in recconing three generations at about an hundred <a id="l185"></a>years. But the reigns of kings I do not equal to generations as the ancient Greeks <a id="l186"></a>&amp; Egyptians did: but I reccon them only at about 18 or 20 years a piece when <a id="l187"></a>ten or twelve kings or more are taken togather in continual successions. So the <a id="l188"></a>first 24 kings of France (Pharamund &amp;c) reigned 458 years, which is one with <a id="l189"></a>another 19 years a piece. The next 24 kings of France (Ludovicus Balbus &amp;c) <a id="l190"></a>reigned 451 years, which is one with another 18<span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1" style="width: 0.712em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.709em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.339em, 1000.71em, 3.051em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-3"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.474em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.32em, 4.204em, -1000em); top: -4.441em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-4" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">3</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.323em, 1000.33em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -3.585em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-5" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">4</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1000.47em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 0.474em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.46em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.411em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-1"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></script> years a piece.

<p id="par22">So then the Observator hath mistaken my meaning in the two main argu<a id="l200"></a>ments on which the whole is founded, &amp; hath undertaken to translate &amp; confute <a id="l201"></a>a paper which he did not understand, &amp; been zealous to print it without my <a id="l202"></a>consent: tho he thought it good for nothing but to get himself a little credit by <a id="l203"></a>translating it to be confuted, &amp; confuting his own translation.</p>
<p id="par23">The Observator saith that I suppose that the Egyptians began about 900 <a id="l204"></a>years before Christ to form their religion, &amp; deify men for their inventions of arts: <a id="l205"></a>notwithstanding that it appears by the scriptures that their idolatry &amp; arts were as <a id="l206"></a>old as the days of Moses &amp; Iacob, pag. 82, 83. But he is again mistaken. I deny <a id="l207"></a>not that the kingdom of the lower Egypt called Mizraim had a religion of their <a id="l208"></a>own till they were invaded &amp; subdued by the shepherds who were of another <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> religion: but I say that when the Thetans (a third people) invaded &amp; expelled the <a id="l209"></a>shepherds they set up the worship of their own kings &amp; princes. I say also <a id="l210"></a>that arts were brought into Europe principally by the Phenicians &amp; Curetes <a id="l211"></a>in the days of Cadmus &amp; David about 1041 years before Christ; &amp; do not <a id="l212"></a>deny that they were in Phœnicia Egypt &amp; Idumæa before they came into Europe</p>
<p id="par24">The Observator saith also that 884 years before Christ I place the beginning <a id="l213"></a>of the Canicular cycle of the Egyptians upon the vernal Equinox, although that cycle ne<a id="l214"></a>ver begins in spring, pag 84, 85. But he is again mistaken.  I meddle not with that <a id="l215"></a>cycle, but I speak of the Egyptian year of 365 days.</p>
<p id="par25">The Observator represents that I have a great work to come out: but I <a id="l216"></a>never told him so. When I lived at Cambridge I used sometimes to refresh my self <a id="l217"></a>with history &amp; chronology for a while when I was weary with other studies: but I <a id="l218"></a>never told him that I was preparing a work of this kind for the publick.</p>
<p id="par26">Abbe Conti came into England in Spring 1715, &amp; while he staid in England, he <a id="l219"></a>pretended to be my friend, but assisted M<sup>r</sup> Leibnits in engageing me in new disputes <a id="l220"></a> &amp; hath since acted in the same manner in France. The part he acted here may be <a id="l221"></a>understood by the account given of him in the <em class="underline">Acta Eruditorum</em> for the year 1721 <a id="l222"></a>pag. 90, where the Editor excusing himself from repeating some disputes which had <a id="l223"></a>been published in those <em class="underline">Acta</em> subjoyns: <em class="underline">Suffecerit itaque annotasse Abbatem quen<a id="l224"></a>dam Italum de Conti, nobilem Venetum, (de quo admiratione digna sibi præscrip<a id="l225"></a>ta esse ab Hermanno fatetur Leibnitius,) cum ex Gallia in Angliam trajecisset, <a id="l226"></a>Mediatoris vices in sa suscipere voluisse, atque literas Newtoni ad Leibnitium <a id="l227"></a>deferri curasse, Leibnitianas cum Newtono communicasse</em>. And how M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l228"></a>by this mediation endeavoured to engage me against my will in new disputes <a id="l229"></a>about occult qualities, universal gravity, the sensorium of God, space, time, vacuum, <a id="l230"></a>atomes, the perfection of the world, supramundane intelligence, &amp; mathematical <a id="l231"></a>problemes, is mentioned in the Preface to the second edition of the <em class="underline">Commercium <a id="l232"></a>epistolicum</em>. And what he hath been doing in Italy, may be understood by the <a id="l233"></a>disputes raised there by one of his friends, who denies many of my Optical <a id="l234"></a>experiments, though they have been all tried in France with success. But <a id="l235"></a>I hope that these things, &amp; the perpetual motion, will be the last efforts <a id="l236"></a>of this kind.</p>

<p id="par27">On thursday last, Novem. 11<sup>th</sup>, at a meeting of the Royal Society, <a id="l239"></a>a small Treatis was delivered to me as a present from M<sup>r</sup> William Che<a id="l240"></a>velier the son, a bookseller at Paris, a person unknown to me, entituled <a id="l241"></a><em class="underline">Abrege de Chronologie de M. Chevalier Newton fait par lui meme <a id="l242"></a>&amp; traduit sur le Manuscript Anglay</em>. And the Bookseller hath premised <a id="l243"></a>an Advertisement in which he endeavours to defend himself for printing <a id="l244"></a>it without my leave, saying that he had writ three letters to me for my <a id="l245"></a>leave &amp; in the third had told me that he would take my silence for a <a id="l246"></a>consent; &amp; that he had also charged one of his friends in London to <a id="l247"></a>speak to me &amp; procure my precise answer: &amp; that having long expected <a id="l248"></a>my answer, he thought that he might take my silence for a sort of <a id="l249"></a>consent; &amp; so procured a Privilege, &amp; printed it, &amp; then received my <a id="l250"></a>answer from his friend, which was as follows.</p>
<p id="par28"><em class="underline">I remember that I wrote a Chronological Index for a particular <a id="l251"></a>friend on condition that it should not be communicated. As I have not <a id="l252"></a>seen the Manuscript which you have under my name, I know not <a id="l253"></a>whether it is the same. That which I wrote was not at all done with designe <a id="l254"></a>to publish it. I intend not to meddle with that which hath been given you under <a id="l255"></a>my name, nor to give any consent to the publishing of it. I am Your very</em> <a id="l256"></a>humble servant Isaac Newton. <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> London. 27 May 1725 stylo vetero.</p>

<p id="par30">The Privilege was  granted May 21<sup>st</sup> &amp; registred May 25<sup>t</sup> <a id="l257"></a>&amp; my Letter dated May 27<sup>th</sup> Old style, &amp; the chronological Index or <a id="l258"></a>Abridgement printed  before the arrival of my Letter at Paris, &amp; kept <a id="l259"></a>ever since to be published at the time of your election of Officers approach<a id="l260"></a>ing. The Bookseller knew that I had not seen this translation of the Chrono <a id="l261"></a>logical Index &amp; without seeing it could not in reason give my consent to the <a id="l262"></a>impression. He knew that the translator was unknown to me &amp; was my <a id="l263"></a>adversary, &amp; therefore he knew that it was not fit that I should give <a id="l264"></a>my consent, nor be asked to do it. He knew that the translator had <a id="l265"></a>written a confutation of the paper translated, &amp; that this confutation <a id="l266"></a>under the title of Observations was to be printed at the end of it; &amp; he <a id="l267"></a>told me nothing of all this, &amp; yet asked my consent to print it: as if any <a id="l268"></a>man could be so foolish as to consent to the printing of his papers with <a id="l269"></a>a confutation annexed &amp; unanswered at their first appearance in public.</p>
<p id="par31">After the recitall of my Letter he adds: <em class="underline">M<sup>r</sup> Newton allows <a id="l270"></a>that he did write a chronological Index for a particular friend</em>. And <a id="l271"></a>perhaps this acknowledgement induced him to print my Letter. He adds <a id="l272"></a>further that the author of the translation &amp; of the observations upon it <a id="l273"></a>pretends to have  an entire certainty that this Index or Abridgment <a id="l274"></a>of Chronology is the same thing with the writing owned by M<sup>r</sup> Newton; <a id="l275"></a>&amp; the same author is perswaded that the Manuscript which hath been <a id="l276"></a>communicated to him hath been copied from that of his friend, that <a id="l277"></a>is, from the Manuscript of this particular friend above mentioned <a id="l278"></a>for whom I wrote it, &amp; whom the author of the translation in the be<a id="l279"></a>ginning of his Observations (pag. 49) calls a great Princess. And there<a id="l280"></a>fore the Manuscript which hath been communicated to him, is that of <a id="l281"></a>Senior Conti a nobleman of Venice   now at Paris. He <a id="l282"></a>being lately in England wrote to me that this Princess desired to speak <a id="l283"></a>with me, &amp; introduced me to her Highness; who then desired a copy of what I <a id="l284"></a>had written about Chronology. I replied that it was imperfect &amp; confused: but <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span> in a few days I could draw up an extract thereof if it might be kept <a id="l285"></a>private. And sometime after I had done this &amp; presented it, her Highness desi<a id="l286"></a>red that Senior Conti might have a copy of it. He knew that it was a <a id="l287"></a>secret, &amp; that it was by the intercession of the Princess &amp; my leave that he <a id="l288"></a>had a copy: &amp; yet without either her leave or mine he dispersed copies <a id="l289"></a>of it in France, &amp; got an Antiquary to translate it into french &amp; <a id="l290"></a>confute it, &amp; the Antiquary has got a Printer to print the translation &amp; the confutation, &amp; the Printer has endeavoured to get my leave to print <a id="l291"></a>the translation without sending me a copy thereof to peruse it, or letting <a id="l292"></a>me know that his designe was to print it with a confutation unanswered &amp; <a id="l293"></a>unknown to me.</p>
<p id="par32">The translator neare the end of his Observations (pag. 90) saith: <a id="l294"></a><em class="underline">I believe that I have said enough concerning the Epoque of the Argonauts, &amp; <a id="l295"></a>the value of generations, to  make people cautious about  <a id="l296"></a>the rest. For these are the two foundations of all this new systeme of <a id="l297"></a>Chronologie</em>. What he saith concerning the Epoque of the Argonauts <a id="l298"></a>is founded on the supposition that I place the Equinox in the time of <a id="l299"></a>the Argonautic Expedition fifteen degrees from the first starr of Aries (p. 75, 79.) <a id="l300"></a>Which is a mistake. <span class="ns">☉</span><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 5v &gt; </span> <span class="ns">☉</span> The first &amp; last starr of Aries are not 30 degrees distant from one <a id="l301"></a>another. The Observator grants that the Constellations were formed <a id="l302"></a>by Chiron (p. 70, 71, 79,) &amp; that the solstices were then in the middles <a id="l303"></a>of the  Constellations (p. 65, 69, 75,) &amp; that Eudoxus in his <a id="l304"></a>Enoptron or speculum cited by Hipparchus followed this opinion <a id="l305"></a>p. 62, 68, 65, 69, 79. And Hipparchus names the starrs through which <a id="l306"></a>the Colure passed in this old sphere, &amp; thereby places the equinoxial <a id="l307"></a>Colure about 7<sup>gr</sup>. 36′ from the first star of Aries, &amp; I follow  <a id="l308"></a>Hipparchus &amp; Eudoxus. But the Observator represents that I place this Colure fifteen degrees from the first starr of Aries &amp; <a id="l309"></a> thence deduces that I should have made the Argonautic <a id="l310"></a>expedition 532 years ancienter then I do<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 6r resumes &gt; </span>  And as for the value <a id="l320"></a>of Generations he saith that I value them one with another at 18 or <a id="l321"></a>20 years a piece (pag 52, 55) which is another mistake. For I agree with <a id="l322"></a>the ancients in valuing three generations at about an hundred years. <a id="l323"></a>But the reigns of  kings I do not equal to generations as the ancient <a id="l324"></a>Greeks &amp; Egyptians did; but I value them only at about 18 or 20 years <a id="l325"></a>a piece when ten or twelve kings or above are taken together in con<a id="l326"></a>tinual succession.  And they that examin this will ffind it true. So then the Observator hath mistaken my mean<a id="l327"></a>ing in the two main arguments on which the whole is founded, &amp; has <a id="l328"></a>undertaken to translate &amp; confute a paper which he did not under<a id="l329"></a>stand, &amp; been zealous to publish it without my consent though he thought it good for <a id="l330"></a>nothing but to  discredit me.</p>
<p id="par33">The Observator represents that I have a great work <a id="l331"></a>to come out; but I never told him so. When I lived at Cam<a id="l332"></a>bridge, I used sometimes to refresh my self with History &amp; chro<a id="l333"></a>nology for a while when I was weary of other studies: but I made nothing <a id="l334"></a>of that kind fit for the press.</p>

<p id="par39">The  Privilege was granted May 21<sup>st</sup> &amp; registred May 25<sup>t</sup> &amp; my Letter <a id="l359"></a>dated May 27<sup>th</sup> Old style, &amp; the Chronological Index, or Abridgement, as he calls it, <a id="l360"></a>printed before the arrival of my Letter at Paris, &amp; kept ever since to be published <a id="l361"></a>at the time of your election of Officers. The bookseller knew that I had not seen <a id="l362"></a>the translation of the Abridgement, &amp; without seeing it could not in reason give <a id="l363"></a>my consent to the impression. He knew that the translator was unknown to me <a id="l364"></a>&amp; was my adversary: &amp; therefore he knew that it was not fit that I should give <a id="l365"></a>my consent nor be asked to do it. He knew that the translator had written a con<a id="l366"></a>futation of the paper translated, &amp; that this confutation under the title of Observations <a id="l367"></a>was to be printed at the end of it; &amp; he told me nothing of all this, &amp; yet asked <a id="l368"></a>my consent to print it: as if amy man could be so foolish as to consent to the <a id="l369"></a>printing of an unseen translation of his papers with a confutation annexed &amp; unanswered at their first <a id="l370"></a>appearance in publick.</p>
<p id="par40">After the recital of my Letter he adds: <em class="underline">M<sup>r</sup> Newton allows that he did <a id="l371"></a>write a chronological Index for a particular friend</em>.

He being about seven years ago in <a id="l382"></a>England wrote to me that this  friend desired to speake with me, &amp;  this friend then desired a copy of what I had written about Chro<a id="l384"></a>nology. I replied that it was imperfect &amp; confused: but in a few days I could <a id="l385"></a>draw up an Extract thereof if it might be kept secret. And sometime after <a id="l386"></a>I had done this &amp; presented it,  this friend  desired that Senior Conti might <a id="l387"></a>have a copy of it.

<h2 id="hd5" class="cent">Response <a id="l462"></a><br>aux Observations sur le Chronologie <a id="l463"></a><br>de M. Newton.</h2>
<p id="par47">On thursday Novem. 11<sup>th</sup>, 1725, a small Tract in print was delivered <a id="l464"></a>to me as a present from M<sup>r</sup> William Chevelier  junior a bookseller at Paris <a id="l465"></a>a person unknown to me, entituled, <em class="underline">Abrege de Chronologie de M. Chevalier <a id="l466"></a>Newton, fait par lui meme, &amp; traduit sur le Manuscript Anglois</em>. And the Book<a id="l467"></a>seller hath premised an advertisement in which he endeavoureth to defend himself <a id="l468"></a>for printing it without my leave, saying he had writ three letters to me for <a id="l469"></a>my leave, &amp; in the third had told me that he would take my silence for a consent; <a id="l470"></a>&amp; that he had also charged one of his friends in London to speak to me &amp; procure my <a id="l471"></a><span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">precise</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">express</span></span> answer; &amp; that having long expected my answer, he thought that he might <a id="l472"></a>take my silence for a sort of consent;  so procured a Privilege, &amp; printed it, &amp; then <a id="l473"></a>received my answer from his friend, which was as follows.</p>
<p id="par48"><em class="underline">I remember that I wrote a Chronological Index for a particular friend <a id="l474"></a>on condition that it should not be communicated. As I have not seen the Manuscript <a id="l475"></a>which you have under my name, I know not whether it be the same. That which I wrote <a id="l476"></a>was not at all done with designe to publish it. I intend not to meddle with that which hath <a id="l477"></a>been given you under my name, nor to give any consent to the publishing of it. I am <a id="l478"></a>your very humble servant Isaac Newton. London 27 May 1725. stylo vetero</em>.</p>
<p id="par49">The Privilege was granted May 21<sup>st</sup>, &amp; registred May 25<sup>t</sup>, &amp; my Letter dated <a id="l479"></a>May 27<sup>th</sup> Old style, &amp; the Chronological Index, or Abridgement as he calls it, printed <a id="l480"></a>before the arrival of my Letter at Paris, &amp; kept ever since to be published at a convenient <a id="l481"></a>time. The bookseller knew that I had not seen the translation of the Abridgment, &amp; <a id="l482"></a>without seeing it could not in reason give my consent to the impression. He knew that <a id="l483"></a>the translator was unknown to me &amp; was against me: &amp; therefore he knew that it was not <a id="l484"></a>fit that I should give my consent, nor be asked to do it. He knew that the translator had <a id="l485"></a>written a confutation of the paper translated, &amp; that this confutation under the title of <a id="l486"></a>Observations was to be printed at the end of it, &amp; he told me nothing of all this nor so much as the name of the Observator &amp; <a id="l487"></a>yet asked my consent to the publishing: as if any man could be so foolish as to <a id="l488"></a>consent to the printing of an unseen translation of his papers with a confutation  <a id="l489"></a> annexed &amp; unanswered  at their first appearance in publick.</p>
<p id="par50">After the first recital of my Letter he adds that the author of the translation <a id="l490"></a>&amp; of the observations upon it, pretends to have an entire certainty that this Index <a id="l491"></a>or abridgement of Chronology is the same with the writing owned by me in my <a id="l492"></a>Letter, &amp; is perswaded that the Manuscript which hath been communicated to him <a id="l493"></a>hath been copied from that of this friend, that is, from the Manuscript of the parti<a id="l494"></a>cular friend above mentioned in my Letter. And therefore the Manuscript <a id="l495"></a>which hath been communicated to him is that of  Abbe Conti a noble Venetian <a id="l496"></a>now at Paris. He being about seven years ago in England, gave me notice that <a id="l497"></a>the friend above mentioned desired to speak with me. And this friend then desired a copy of what <a id="l498"></a>I had written about Chronology. I replied that it was imperfect &amp; confused: but <a id="l499"></a>in a few days I could draw up an extract thereof if it might be kept secret. And sometime after I had done this &amp; presented it, this friend desired that <a id="l500"></a>Abbe Conti might have a copy of it. He was the only person who had a copy, &amp; he knew <a id="l501"></a>that it was a secret &amp; that it was at the desire of this friend &amp; by my leave <a id="l502"></a>that he had a copy, &amp; he kept it secret while he staid in England: &amp; yet without either <a id="l503"></a>this friends leave or mine, he dispersed copies of it in France, &amp; got an antiquary to <a id="l504"></a>translate it into French, &amp; to confute it, &amp; the Antiquary hath got a Printer to print <a id="l505"></a>the translation &amp; the confutation, &amp; the Printer hath endeavoured to get my leave <a id="l506"></a>to print the translation without sending me  a coppy thereof to be perused, or telling <a id="l507"></a>me the name of the translator, or letting me know that his designe was to print it <a id="l508"></a>with a confutation unanswered &amp; unknown to me.</p>
<p id="par51">The translator neare the end of his Observations (pag.90) saith: <em class="underline">I believe that I have said enough concerning the Epoque of the Argonauts &amp; the length of genera<a id="l509"></a>tions to make people cautious about the rest. For these are the two foundations of all <a id="l510"></a>this new systeme of Chronology</em>. What he saith concerning the Epoque of the Argonauts <a id="l511"></a>is founded on the supposition that I place the Equinox of the Argonautic <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> expedition fifteen degrees from the first starr of Aries, p. 75, 79. Which is a mistake <a id="l512"></a>The first &amp; last starr of Aries are not 30 degrees from one another  as they should be that the middle <a id="l513"></a>of the Constellation may be fifteen degrees from each. The Observator grants that <a id="l514"></a>the Constellations were formed by Chiron (pag. 70, 71, 79) &amp; that the solstices &amp; Equinoxes were <a id="l515"></a>then in the middles of the Constellations (pag. 65, 69, 75) &amp; that Eudoxus in his Enop<a id="l516"></a>tron or speculum cited by Hipparchus followed this opinion, p. 62, 63, 65, 69, 79. And <a id="l517"></a>Hipparchus <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> names the starrs through which the Colures passed in this old sphere <a id="l520"></a>according to Eudoxus, &amp; thereby places the Equinoctial Colure about 7<sup>gr</sup> 36′ <a id="l521"></a>from the first starr of Aries; &amp; I follow Hipparchus &amp; Eudoxus. But the Obser<a id="l522"></a>vator represents that I place this Colure fifteen degrees from the <em class="underline">first starr</em> of <a id="l523"></a>Aries, &amp; thence deduces that I should have made the Argonautic Expedition <a id="l524"></a>532 years earlier then I do. Let him rectify his mistake, &amp; the Argonautic <a id="l525"></a>Expedition will be where I place it.</p>
<p id="par52">And as for the length of <em class="underline">generations</em>, he saith that I reccon them one with <a id="l526"></a>another at 18 or 20 years a piece (pag. 52, 55:) which is another mistake. I <a id="l527"></a>agree with the ancients in recconing three generations at about an hundred years. <a id="l528"></a>But the reigns of Kings I do not equal to generations, as the ancient Greeks &amp; Egyp<a id="l529"></a>tians did: but I reccon them only at about 18 or 20 years a piece when ten or <a id="l530"></a>twelve kings or more are taken together in continual succession. So the first <a id="l531"></a>24 Kings of France (Pharmund &amp;c) reigned 458 years, which is one with another <a id="l532"></a>19 years a piece. The next 24 Kings of France (Ludovicus Balbus &amp;c) <a id="l533"></a>reigned 451 years, which is one with another 18<span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-5-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-21" style="width: 0.712em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.709em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.339em, 1000.71em, 3.051em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-22"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-23"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.474em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.32em, 4.204em, -1000em); top: -4.441em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-24" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">3</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.323em, 1000.33em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -3.585em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-25" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">4</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1000.47em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 0.474em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.46em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.411em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-5"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></script> years.

<h2 id="hd6" class="cent">Response <a id="l579"></a><br>aux Observations sur le Chronologie <a id="l580"></a><br>de M. Newton.</h2>
<p id="par58">On thursday Novem. 11<sup>th</sup> 1725, a small Tract in print was delivered to me as a present <a id="l581"></a>from M<sup>r</sup> William Chevalier junior a bookseller at Paris, a person unknown to me, entituled, <em class="underline">Abrege <a id="l582"></a>de Chronologie de M. Chevalier Newton, fait par lui meme, &amp; traduit sur le Manuscript Anglois</em>. And <a id="l583"></a>the Bookseller hath premised an advertisement in which he endeavoureth to defend himself for printing <a id="l584"></a>it without my leave, saying that he had writ three letters to me for my leave, &amp; in the third had <a id="l585"></a>told me that he would take my silence for a consent; &amp; that he had also charged one of his friends <a id="l586"></a>in London to speak to me &amp; procure my express answer; &amp; that having long expected my an<a id="l587"></a>swer, he thought that he might take my silence for a sort of consent; &amp; so procured a privilege <a id="l588"></a>&amp; printed it, &amp; then received my answer from his friend, which was as follows.</p>
<p id="par59"><em class="underline">I remember that I wrote a Chronological Index for a particular friend on condition that <a id="l589"></a>it should  not be communicated. As I have not seen the Manuscript which you have <a id="l590"></a>under my name, I know not whether it be the same. That which I wrote was not at all done with designe <a id="l591"></a>to publish it. I intend not to meddle with that which hath been given you under my name, nor to give any <a id="l592"></a>consent to the publishing of it. I am Your very humble servant Isaac Newton. London. 27 May, 1725, stylo vetero</em>.</p>
<p id="par60">The Privilege was granted May 21 &amp; registred May 25 old style &amp; my Letter dated May 27, &amp; the <a id="l593"></a>Chronological Index,  or Abridgement as he calls it, printed  before the arrival of my Letter at <a id="l594"></a>Paris, &amp; kept ever since to be published at a convenient time. The Bookseller knew that I had not <a id="l595"></a>seen the translation of the Abridgment &amp; without seeing it could not in reason give my consent to the <a id="l596"></a>impression. He knew that the translator was unkown to me, &amp; was against me: &amp; therefore he knew <a id="l597"></a>that it was not fit that I should give my consent, nor be asked to do it. He knew that the translator <a id="l598"></a>had written a confutation of the paper translated, &amp; that this confutation under the title of Obser<a id="l599"></a>vations was to be printed at the end of it; &amp; he told me nothing of all this, nor so much as the name <a id="l600"></a>of the Observator, &amp; yet asked my consent to the publishing: as if any man could be so foolish as to <a id="l601"></a>consent to the publishing of an unseen translation of his papers made by an unknown person with a confutation annexed &amp; un<a id="l602"></a>answered at their first appearance in publick.</p>
<p id="par61">After the recital of my Letter he adds that the author of the translation &amp; of the Observations <a id="l603"></a>upon it, pretends to have an entire certainty that this Index or Abridgement of Chronology is the same <a id="l604"></a>with the writing owned by me in my Letter, &amp; is perswaded that the Manuscript which hath been com<a id="l605"></a>municated to him, hath been copied from that of this friend, that is, from that of the particular <a id="l606"></a>friend above mentioned in my Letter. And therefore the Manuscript which hath been communi<a id="l607"></a>cated to him is that of Abbe Conti a noble Venetian now at Paris. He being about seven years <a id="l608"></a>ago in England gave me notice that the friend above mentioned desired to speak with me. And <a id="l609"></a>this friend then desired a copy of what I had written about Chronology. I replied that it was imperfect <a id="l610"></a>&amp; confused, but in a few days I could draw up an abstract thereof if it might be kept secret. <a id="l611"></a>And some time after I had done this &amp; presented it, this friend desired that signior Conti might <a id="l612"></a>have a copy of it. He was the only person who had a copy, &amp; he knew that it was a secret, &amp; that <a id="l613"></a>it was at the desire of this friend &amp; by my leave that he had a copy &amp; he kept it secret while he <a id="l614"></a>staid in England: &amp; yet without either this friends leave or mine he dispersed copies of it in <a id="l615"></a>France, &amp; got an antiquary to translate it into French, &amp; to confute it, &amp; the Antiquary hath <a id="l616"></a>got a Printer to print the translation &amp; the confutation, &amp; the Printer hath  endeavoured to get <a id="l617"></a>my leave to print the translation without sending me a copy thereof to be perused, or telling <a id="l618"></a>the name of the translator; or letting me know what his designe was to print it with a confu<a id="l619"></a>tation unanswered &amp; unknown to me.</p>
<p id="par62">The translator neare the end of his Observations (pag. 90) saith: I beleive that I have <a id="l620"></a>said enough concerning the <em class="underline">Epoque</em> of the Argonauts &amp; the length of <em class="underline">generations</em> to make people <a id="l621"></a>cautious about the rest. For these are the two foundations of all this new systeme of Chronology. <a id="l622"></a>What he saith concerning the <em class="underline">Epoque</em> of the Argonauts is founded on the suppo<a id="l623"></a>sition that I place the Equinox in the time of the Argonautic Expedition fifteen degrees from <a id="l624"></a>the first star of Aries, pag. 75, 79. I place it in the middle of the  constellation &amp; the middle <a id="l625"></a>is not fifteen degrees from the first  starr of Aries. The observator grants that the Con<a id="l626"></a>stellations were formed by Chiron (pag. 70, 71, 79) &amp; that the solstices &amp; Equinoxes were then in <a id="l627"></a>the middles of the Constellations (pag. 65, 69, 75) &amp; that <em class="underline">Eudoxus</em> in his <em class="underline">Enoptron</em> or <em class="underline">Speculum</em> <a id="l628"></a>cited  by <em class="underline">Hipparchus</em> followed this opinion, pag. 62, 63, 65, 69, 79. And <em class="underline">Hipparchus</em> <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> names <a id="l631"></a>the starrs through which the Colures passed in this old sphere according to <em class="underline">Eudoxus</em>, &amp; there<a id="l632"></a>by places the Equinoctial Colure about 7<sup>degr.</sup> 36′ from the first starr of Aries; &amp; I fol<a id="l633"></a>low <em class="underline">Hipparchus</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Eudoxus</em>. But the Observator represents that I place the Colure fifteen <a id="l634"></a>degrees from the first starr of Aries,  &amp; thence deduces that I should have made the <a id="l635"></a>Argonautic Expedition 532 years earlier then I do. Let him rectify his mistake, &amp; the Argo<a id="l636"></a>nautic Expedition will be where I place it.</p>
<p id="par63">As for the length of <em class="underline">generations</em>, he saith that I reccon them one with another at 18 or 20 <a id="l637"></a>years a piece (pag. 52, 55:) which is another mistake. I agree with the ancients in recconing <a id="l638"></a>thre generations at about an hundred years. But the reigns of kings I do not equall to genera<a id="l639"></a>tions as the ancient Greeks &amp; Egyptians did: but I reccon them only at about 18 or 20 years <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span> a piece one with another when ten or twelve kings or more are taken in continual succession. <a id="l640"></a>So the first 24 Kings of France (<em class="underline">Pharamund</em> &amp;c) reigned 458 years which is one with <a id="l641"></a>another 19 years a piece. The next 24 Kings of France (<em class="underline">Ludovicus Balbus</em> &amp;c) reigned <a id="l642"></a>451 years, which is one with another 18<span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-7-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-31" style="width: 0.712em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.709em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.339em, 1000.71em, 3.051em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-32"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-33"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.474em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.32em, 4.204em, -1000em); top: -4.441em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-34" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">3</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.323em, 1000.33em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -3.585em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-35" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">4</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1000.47em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 0.474em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.46em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.411em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-7"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></script> years a piece.

<p id="par72">The Privilege was granted May 21 &amp; registred May 25 old style, <a id="l703"></a>&amp; my letter dated May 27, &amp; the Chronological Index, or Abridgement, as he <a id="l704"></a>calls it, printed before the arrival of my Letter at Paris; &amp; kept  ever since <a id="l705"></a>to be published at a convenient time. The bookseller knew that I had not seen <a id="l706"></a>the translation of the Abridgement, &amp; without seeing it could not in reason <a id="l707"></a>give my consent to the impression. He knew that the translator was unknown <a id="l708"></a>to me, &amp; was against me: &amp; therefore he knew that it was not fit that I <a id="l709"></a>should give my consent, nor be asked to do it. He knew that the trans<a id="l710"></a>lator had written a confutation of the paper translated, &amp; that this confu<a id="l711"></a>tation under the title of observations was to be printed at the end of it; &amp; <a id="l712"></a>he told me nothing of all this, nor so much as the name of the Obser<a id="l713"></a>vator; &amp; yet asked my consent to the publishing: as if any man could <a id="l714"></a>be so foolish as to consent to the publishing of an unseen translation of <a id="l715"></a>his papers made by an unknown person with a confutation annexed &amp; <a id="l716"></a>unanswered at their first appearance in publik.</p>
<p id="par73">After the recital of my Letter, he adds that the author of the trans<a id="l717"></a>lation &amp; of the Observations upon it, pretends to have an entire certainty <a id="l718"></a>that this Index or Abridgement  of Chronology is the same with the <a id="l719"></a>writing owned by me in my letter, &amp; is perswaded that the Manuscript which <a id="l720"></a>hath been communicated to him  hath been copied from <a id="l721"></a>that of this friend, that is from that of the particular friend above mentioned <a id="l722"></a>in my Letter. And therefore the manuscript which hath been communicated to <a id="l723"></a>him is that of Abbe Conti a noble Venetian now at Paris. He being about <a id="l724"></a>seven years ago in England gave me notice that the friend above mentioned <a id="l725"></a>desired to speak with me. And this friend then  desired a copy of what I <a id="l726"></a>had written about Chronology. I replied that it was imperfect &amp; confused, <a id="l727"></a>but in a few days I could draw up an extract thereof if it might be kept <a id="l728"></a>secret. And sometime after I had done this &amp; presented it, this friend desired <a id="l729"></a>that Abbe Conti might have a coppy of it. He was the only person who <a id="l730"></a>had a copy, &amp; he knew that it was a secret, &amp;  that it was at the <a id="l731"></a>desire of this friend &amp; by my leave that he had a copy, &amp; he kept it secret <a id="l732"></a>while he staid in England: &amp; yet without either this friends leave or mine <a id="l733"></a>he dispersed copies of it in France, &amp; got an Antiquary to translate it <a id="l734"></a>into French &amp; to confute it, &amp; the Antiquary hath got a Printer to print the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013v"> &lt;13v&gt; </span> translation &amp; the confutation, &amp; the Printer hath <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>endeavoured<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> to get my leave <a id="l735"></a>to print the translation without sending me a copy thereof to be perused, or telling me the name of the translator; or letting me know that his designe <a id="l736"></a>was to print it with a confutation unanswered &amp; unknown to me.</p>
<p id="par74">The Translator neare the end of his Observations (pag. 90) saith: <a id="l737"></a>I believe that I have said enough concerning the <em class="underline">Epoque</em> of the Argonauts <a id="l738"></a>&amp; the length of <em class="underline">Generations</em> to make people cautious about the rest. For <a id="l739"></a>these are the two foundations of all this new systeme of Chronology.</p>
<p id="par75">What he saith concerning the <em class="underline">Epoque</em> of the Argonauts  is founded on <a id="l740"></a>on the supposition that I place the Equinox in the time of the Argonautic <a id="l741"></a>Expedition fifteen degrees from the first star of Aries, pag. 75, 79. I place <a id="l742"></a>it in the middle of the constellation &amp; the middle of the constellation <a id="l743"></a>is not fifteen degrees from the first star of Aries. The Observator grants <a id="l744"></a>that the Contellations were formed by Chiron (pag. 70,  71, 79,) &amp; that <a id="l745"></a>the solstices &amp; equinoxes were then in the middles of the Constellations (pag. 65, 69, <a id="l746"></a>75.) &amp; that  <em class="underline">Eudoxus</em> in his Enoptron or Speculum cited by <em class="underline">Hipparchus</em> <a id="l747"></a>followed this opinion, p. 62, 63, 65, 69, 79. And <em class="underline">Hipparchus</em> <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> names the <a id="l751"></a>starrs through which the colures passed in this old sphere according to <em class="underline">Eudoxus</em>, &amp; <a id="l752"></a>thereby places the Equinoctial Colure about 7<sup>degr</sup> 36′ from the first star <a id="l753"></a>of Aries: &amp; I follow <em class="underline">Hipparchus</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Eudoxus</em>. But the Observator repre<a id="l754"></a>sents that I place the Colure fifteen degrees from the first starr of Aries <a id="l755"></a>&amp; thence deduces that I should have made the Argonautic expedition 532 years <a id="l756"></a>earlier then I do. Let him rectify his mistake, &amp; the Argonautic <a id="l757"></a>expedition will be where I place it.</p>
<p id="par76">And as for the length of <em class="underline">generations</em>, he saith that I reccon them one <a id="l758"></a>with another at 18 or 20 years a piece (pag. 52, 59:) which is another mistake. <a id="l759"></a>I agree with the ancients in recconing three generations at about an hun<a id="l760"></a>dred yeares. But the reigns of kings I do not equal to generations as <a id="l761"></a>the ancient Greeks &amp; Egyptians did: but I reccon them only at about 18 <a id="l762"></a>or 20 years a piece when ten or twelve kings or more are taken together <a id="l763"></a>in continual succession. So the first 24 Kings of France (<em class="underline">Pharamund</em> &amp;c) <a id="l764"></a>reigned 458 years, which is one with another 19 years a piece. The next <a id="l765"></a>24 Kings of France (<em class="underline">Ludovicus Balbus</em> &amp;c) reigned 451 years, which <a id="l766"></a>is one with another 18<span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-9-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-41" style="width: 0.712em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.709em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.339em, 1000.71em, 3.051em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-42"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-43"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.474em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.32em, 4.204em, -1000em); top: -4.441em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-44" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">3</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.323em, 1000.33em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -3.585em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-45" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">4</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1000.47em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 0.474em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.46em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.411em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-9"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></script> years a piece.

<p id="par77">So then the Observator hath mistaken my meaning in the two main <a id="l782"></a>arguments on which the whole is founded, &amp; hath undertaken to translate &amp; <a id="l783"></a>confute a paper which he did not understand, &amp; been zealous to print it without my <a id="l784"></a>consent: tho  he thought it good for nothing but to get himself a <a id="l785"></a>little credit by translating it to be confuted &amp; confuting his own translation.</p>
<p id="par78">The observator saith that I suppose that the Egyptians began about 900 <a id="l786"></a>years before Christ to form their religion &amp; deify men for their inventions of arts, <a id="l787"></a>notwithstanding that it appears by the scriptures that their idolatry &amp; arts were <a id="l788"></a>as old as the days of  Moses &amp; Iacob, pag. 82, 83. But he is again mistaken. <a id="l789"></a>I deny not that the kingdom of the lower Egypt called Misraim had a religion of <a id="l790"></a>their own till they were invaded &amp; subdued by the shepherds who were of another <a id="l791"></a>religion: but I say that when the Thebans (a third people) invaded &amp; expelled the shepherds, they <a id="l792"></a>set up the worship of their own kings &amp; princes. I say also that arts were <a id="l793"></a>brought into  Europe principally by the Phenicians &amp; Curetes in the days of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> Cadmus &amp; David about 1041 years before Christ; &amp; do not deny that they were in <a id="l794"></a>Phœnicia Egypt &amp; Idumæa before they came into Europe.</p>
<p id="par79">The Observator saith also that 884 years before Christ I place the be<a id="l795"></a>ginning of the Canicular cycle of the Egyptians upon the vernal Equinox, <a id="l796"></a>although that cycle never begins in Spring, pag. 84, 85. But he is again mistak<a id="l797"></a>en. I meddle not with that cycle but speak of the Egyptian year of 365 days.</p>
<p id="par80">The Observator represents that I have a great work to come out: but I <a id="l798"></a> never told him so. When I lived at Cambridge, <a id="l799"></a>I used sometimes to refresh my self with history &amp; chronology for a while <a id="l800"></a>when I was weary  with other studies: but I never told him that I was prepar<a id="l801"></a>ing a work of  this kind for the publick.</p>
<p id="par81">Abbe Conti came into England in Spring 1715, &amp; while he staid in <a id="l802"></a>England he pretended to be my friend, but assisted M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in engaging <a id="l803"></a>me in new disputes, &amp; hath  since acted in the same manner in France. The part he acted here may be understood by the  account given of him in <a id="l804"></a>the Acta Eruditorum for the year 1721 pag. 90, where the Editor excusing <a id="l805"></a>himself from repeating some disputes which had been published in those <a id="l806"></a>Acta, subjoyns: <em class="underline">Suffecerit itaque annotasse Abbatem quendam Italum de <a id="l807"></a>Conti, nobilem Venetum, (de quo admiratione digna sibi præscripta <a id="l808"></a>esse ab Hermanno fatetur Leibnitius,) cum ex Gallia in Angliam <a id="l809"></a>trajecisset, Mediatoris vices in se suscipere voluisse, atque litteras Newtoni <a id="l810"></a>ad Leibnitium deferri curasse, Leibnitianas cum Newtono communi<a id="l811"></a>casse</em>. And how M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz by this pretended mediation endeavoured to engage me <a id="l812"></a>against my will in new disputes about occult qualities, universal <a id="l813"></a>gravity, the sensorium of God, space, time, vacuum, atomes, the per<a id="l814"></a>fection of the world, supramundane intelligence, &amp; mathematical <a id="l815"></a>problemes, is mentioned in the Preface to the second edition of the <a id="l816"></a><em class="underline">Commercium Epistolicum</em>. And what he hath been doing in Italy may <a id="l817"></a>be understood by the disputes raised there by one of his friends who <a id="l818"></a>denyes many of my Optical experiments, tho they have been all tried <a id="l819"></a>in France with success. But I hope that these things, &amp; the perpe<a id="l820"></a>tual motion, will be the last efforts of this kind.</p>
