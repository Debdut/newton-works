    <p id="par24">Not long after  Halacu being about to return into the eastern regions <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003v"> &lt;3v&gt; </span> the other army came to him from the siege of Miepharekin bringing with them <a id="l130"></a>Ashraph the Sultan thereof &amp; relating how they had slain all that were in <a id="l131"></a>the city, there being but few  of them  whom <a id="l132"></a>the famin had not destroyed before.</p>
    <p id="par25">About the same time Hulacu so soon as he came neare Maredin <a id="l133"></a>cited the Sultan thereof,  who refusing to appear before him, the Tatars <a id="l134"></a>beseige that city also, but the Sultan dying suddenly, his son Modhaffer presently <a id="l135"></a>yeilds the City to Hulacu whereupon Hulacu treated him honourably &amp; restored <a id="l136"></a>the City to him with the rest of his fathers dominions. Yet about 30 years after this Sultany as well as the rest was  utterly dissolved.</p>
    <p id="par26">The next year AC 1261  Saleh the Sultan of Mausela with his brother combining <a id="l137"></a>with the Egyptians against the Tartars, was invaded also by them under the <a id="l138"></a>leading of Samdago one of Hulacu's captains, &amp;  Mausela <a id="l139"></a>beseiged &amp; taken  the soldiers continuing for 8 days together to  kill spoile &amp; captive the city. And amongst the rest Saleh was taken <a id="l141"></a>&amp; commanded to be slain by Hulacu</p>
    
    <p id="par28"> Vntil this time the  Greeks had constantly posessed <a id="l144"></a>Asia minor, strictly so called, Paphlagonia  Bithinia, Phrygia magna, Phrygia Pacatiana, <a id="l145"></a>Caria, &amp; part of Cilicia; &amp; the rest of  the Asian provinces to Eufrates (namely  Lycaonia Galatia, Pamphilia, <a id="l147"></a>Armenia, Helenopontus, Pisidia, &amp; Lycia)  belonged to the <a id="l149"></a>Sultany of Iconium. But now the  Turks  of Mesopotamia &amp; Syria bing molested by the Tartars  flocked into Asia <a id="l151"></a>to  shelter them selves under the  the Iconian sultan  &amp;   to <a id="l152"></a>obtain new seats  their severall Princes make wars upon the Grecians.  Mantachia subdued <a id="l153"></a>the city Ephesus &amp; the Province Caria, Atin  conquered Lydia as far as Smyrna Sarohan<a id="l154"></a>all Magnesia to Pergamus together with the whole Province of the Magedi.

    <p id="par29">In the meane time the Iconian Sultany became much afflicted &amp; <a id="l157"></a>weakened by the Tartars pressing upon them &amp; taking from the regions <a id="l158"></a>next Eufrates insomuch that at the death of Aladin it was utterly  dissolved.  And  then or soon after namely in the year 1299 Ottoman being <a id="l160"></a>grown more powerful then the rest of the Turkish Princes took upon <a id="l161"></a>him the title of Sultan &amp; by degrees became the universall Monarch of the Turks, the rest of the  Princes uniting under <a id="l162"></a>him; whereby being  rendered more powerfull they prevailed still more <a id="l163"></a>upon the Greeks &amp;  within a while invaded Europe &amp; ceased not to propagate <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> their victories till  at length they  overthrew the Contstantinopolitan Empire <a id="l164"></a>&amp; on its ruins erected that great Empire which we see at present.</p>

    <p id="par30">Now in this history if we should reccon   the angels losed  to be the  regal <a id="l165"></a>cities actually which were  together overthrown by H, they would be  Bagdad, Miephare<a id="l166"></a>kin; Aleppo, &amp; Mausela. But  Bagdad being not a Turkish sultany <a id="l167"></a>like the rest but in the hands of the Chalifa who  had been always of the Saracen nation &amp; for almost the last 500 years of one &amp; the same family of the Abasides <a id="l169"></a>it is more proper to refer the destruction of this city to the former Trumpet <a id="l170"></a>as  the conclusion thereof, &amp; so   the following dissolution of the Turkish sultanies with which this <a id="l171"></a>Trumpet begins will  fall in with the  loosing of the Angels. And in these if we consider that Mie<a id="l172"></a>pharekin was but lately rent from  the Sultany of Maredin, &amp; guirded on one <a id="l173"></a>hand by the Kingdom of Armenia &amp; on the other by the Sultany of Maredin <a id="l174"></a> their seats Maredin &amp; Miepharekin being not above 60 or 90 Italian <a id="l175"></a>miles distant,  &amp; also that <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Maeredin<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> was seated  <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>beyond<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Tigris this Sultany   was neither of <a id="l176"></a>equall standing nor extent with the rest  nor so properly  bound in Euphrates </p>
    <p id="par31" class="i0">it will be more  reasonable to  refer this sultany to that of Maredin as a <a id="l178"></a>branch thereof:] &amp; so there will remain these four great Turkish nations, the <a id="l179"></a>South-Mesopotamian the North Mesopotamian  including part of Armenia, the Syrian &amp; <a id="l180"></a>the Asian, <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 1v &gt; </span>with which at this time <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub"> the turkish dominions were bounded, &amp; all which</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">were the full extent of the turkish dominions &amp; all which with</span></span> <a id="l181"></a> in the<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 4r resumes &gt; </span> compas of   30 or 40 years after the desolation of  the Chalifate that is in the beginning of this Trumpet were overrun  &amp;  losed by the Tartars from their Eufratean seats &amp; forced upon the Christians to make <a id="l183"></a>war upon them &amp; erect that great Empire which rules at present &amp; is the  great plague <a id="l184"></a>of  Apostate Christendom threatned in  this Trumpet.</p>
        <p id="par32">The greatest objection against this interpretation is that Miepharekin was <a id="l185"></a>at this time a distinct Sultany &amp; so there should have been rather 5 then <a id="l186"></a>4 Angels. But if we consider that this Sultany was neither of equal standing nor <a id="l187"></a>extent with the rest being but lately rent from the sultany of Maredin &amp; guirded on the one hand by the kingdom of Arm. &amp; on the other by the Sultany of Maredin <a id="l188"></a> whose seats M. &amp; M.  were not above 6 or 90 Italian miles distant; &amp; also that <a id="l189"></a>miepharekin was seated beyond Tigris &amp; so not so  truly bound in Euphr as <a id="l190"></a>the rest: it will be more  naturall to refer this (as I signified above) to the Sul<a id="l191"></a>tany of Maredin as a branch thereof reconning them both to make but one great nation or Angel as formerly, then to then to fellow it with the originall <a id="l192"></a>Sultanies. A case not unlike this we have in the third of Daniels universal <a id="l193"></a>Empires represented by the Leopard who had 4 heads to signify its division <a id="l194"></a>into four kingdoms at the death of Alexander. And yet it was divided into <a id="l195"></a>more then 4 Kingdoms [For besides the Egyptian, Syrian, Asian, &amp; Macedonian Kingdom <a id="l196"></a>there was (to mention no others) the  Thracian which  continued distinct about 36 years, &amp; yet  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004v"> &lt;4v&gt; </span>    but this becaus none of the principall  kingdoms such as might <a id="l197"></a>properly be represented by the heads of the beast,  was not recconned among the <a id="l198"></a>other 4 but rather  referred to the Kingdom of Macedon   as I suppose because it was at length united to that compare this with the present case of the Turks, &amp; I think it <a id="l200"></a>will make the interpretation clear.</p>

    <p id="par36">Moreover whereas I interpret the loosing of the Angels to be the disso<a id="l215"></a>lution of these Euphratean Sultanies, this interpretation is confirmed not <a id="l216"></a>only by the opposition which loosing has to their being bound in Euphrates, but <a id="l217"></a>also by the 6<sup>t</sup> Vial which is coincident with this Trumpet  &amp; in <a id="l218"></a>the beginning of which the water of Euphrates was dried up that the way of the <a id="l219"></a>Kings of the East might be prepared.

    <p id="par37">Analogous to the losing of these angels is the drying up the waters of Euphra<a id="l222"></a>tes in the 6<sup>t</sup> Vial. For these two actions  must correspond with one another because they are the beginning of <a id="l223"></a>this  Trumpet &amp; Viall which are contemporary. Now by the waters of – Def  that is the dissolution of those sultanies by the Tartars. And consequently by the Kings or Princes <a id="l225"></a>of the East whose way  was prepared by the drying up of Eufrates, we must understand the  Chief leaders <a id="l226"></a>of the great Army of Horsmen which upon the loosing of the 4 angels came from Eu<a id="l227"></a>frates to execute the plague of this Trumpet that is the  Princes under whose <a id="l228"></a>conduct the Turks fled from the Tartars into Asia  &amp; began to invade the Christians</p></div>

    <div><p id="par38">But you'l say perhaps this was a prediction of the father of his &amp;  it's rashness &amp; uncharitableness to  accuse the Christian world upon such <a id="l230"></a>grounds as these.</p>
                <p id="par39">Thus you  have the consent of Prophesies both sacred &amp; prophane to assigne to this nick of time  the end of <a id="l231"></a>the Church &amp; begining of wicked  times of the Beast <a id="l232"></a>&amp; the consent of the event also  to confirm these prophesies.

Yet for the sake of these men I shall add something <a id="l239"></a>to shame 'em at least if not to convince 'em.

My Author is <a id="l250"></a>Salvian one of their own Bishops who after above 40 years observation wrote a tract to convince those of his own <a id="l251"></a>religion  that such was   their extreme wickedness  they provoked the divine vengeance to execute upon them those severe judgments  of the <a id="l253"></a>Barbarian invasions which you shall hear described in the Trumpets. But to waken <a id="l254"></a>your attention to this author I shal with all give you the judgment of the great Cardinal Ba<a id="l255"></a>ronius, a man unwilling to confes any thing to the scandal of his Church that he <a id="l256"></a>can decline. Imperium, saith Baronius, – / <span class="hspac-n" title="2 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He proceeds further to tell <a id="l257"></a>how some men went about the streets in weomens apparell known to the City &amp; connived <a id="l258"></a>at by  the magistrates, but what has been produc't is enough to cause teares &amp; astonish<a id="l259"></a>ment, &amp; almost too much to be believed did not the circum<a id="l261"></a>stances of the Author ascertain it:  [which were such that Baronius  mentioning these <a id="l262"></a>things, could not but subjoyn. Cæterum]  And yet Baronius mentioning these things <a id="l263"></a>confesses he dealt favourably with the  accused. Cæterùm inquit</p>
                <p id="par40"> Salvian having thus described the Roman manners in general &amp; then those <a id="l264"></a>of its several Provinces in particular proceeds one step farther &amp; shows that they were so stupid<a id="l265"></a>ly wicked so hardened in sin that the  greatest afflictions could never make 'em <a id="l266"></a>relent or remit their cours of sinning, no not in the  very nick of danger: for proof of which he instances in <a id="l267"></a>times that their principal cities were taken by the enemy.

What Sultans it had before the year Heg. 515. <a id="l369"></a>I find not, but then it came into the hands of Gazi sultan of Maredin &amp; he dying <a id="l370"></a>the next year his Sons Solyman &amp; Tamartash inherited the one Miepharekin, the other Maredin. Afterwards <a id="l371"></a>Maredin &amp; Miepharekin were united again under one Sultan &amp;  I know not whether they continued so  till  Saladin invaded Mesopotamia  who amongst his other victories <a id="l373"></a>took  Miepharekin with the adjacent regions,  &amp; left it to his brother Adel, &amp; after his <a id="l374"></a>death   it had without interruptions Sultans of the posterity of Saladin Adel f.  &amp; sub eo Nojmoddin fil. 1193 <sup>2</sup>Modhaffer fil Adeli 1218 &amp; <sup>3</sup>Ashraph Modhafferi fil  <a id="l375"></a>the last of which was slain by the Tartars (A.C. 1260.)  <a id="l376"></a></p>
                
                <p id="par68">Now of these six Sultanies that  of Bagdad is to be omitted because it <a id="l377"></a>ceased long before the loosing of the angels &amp; while it lasted was coincident with the Chalifate. <a id="l378"></a>Also that of Maredin is to be omitted because of its distance from Euphrates. <a id="l379"></a>At first indeed, while it was united to that of Miepharekin it extended to Euphra<a id="l380"></a>tes, but not after Saladin invaded Mesopotamia, for he took Roka Harran Nisibis <a id="l381"></a>Senjar, Ameda, &amp; Miepharekin with their ditions, that is almost all the regions round <a id="l382"></a>on that side  Maredin towards Euphrates, &amp; these regions his Sons &amp; his son's sons <a id="l383"></a>inhærited  except that the Sultan of Mausel  (Pharajius <a id="l384"></a>pag <span class="hspac-n" title="25 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wherefore since  the angels  which were  loosed  from their Euphrates bonds must signify such <a id="l386"></a>sultanies as were adjacent to Euphrates in the years immediately preceding their loos<a id="l387"></a>ing, &amp; this loosing happened not before the end of the fift <a id="l388"></a>Trumpet  which as we shall  hereafter explain ended  not before the <a id="l389"></a>dissolution of the Chalifate A.C. 1258,  we must not number this Sultany among the Angels: we must reject this <a id="l391"></a>Sultany seeing it was nevet adjacent to Euph. after the year 1182.</p>
                <p id="par69">There remain therefore for the 4 Angels the Sultanies of Mausela <a id="l392"></a>Miepharekin, Syria, &amp; Asia. And these fulfill all conditions. The Sultany <a id="l393"></a>of  Asia without question bordered always upon Euphrates  especially towards <a id="l394"></a>the time of loosing  for then &amp; for <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> years before <a id="l395"></a>it comprehended the provinces of Malatia &amp; Chartaberta which  lay upon that <a id="l396"></a>river (Pharajius p 314, 317, 321, 332 &amp; 333) &amp;  at the very time of losing <a id="l397"></a>(A.C. 1260 &amp; 1261) Parajius (pag  expresses that it extended to Armenia major <a id="l398"></a>Yea sometimes it  had extended into the regions of Mesopotamia &amp; Armenia <a id="l399"></a>major. (Abdul. p <span class="hspac-n" title="10 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) The Sultany of Syria was not only always <a id="l400"></a>adjacent to the river but at the time of loosing extended a good way into Mesop.</p>
                <span class="pagenumber" id="p007v"> &lt;7v&gt; </span>
                <p id="par70">Yea &amp; of the Sultanies here named, two make nothing to our purpose: the <a id="l401"></a>sultany of Bagdad becaus it ceased long bef. t.  end of the 5<sup>t</sup> Tr. &amp; w. it l. w. c <a id="l402"></a>w. t. chalifate; &amp; the Sultany of Maredin becaus of its distance from Euphrates. <a id="l403"></a>For when Saliadin invaded Mesopotamia (viz: A.C. 1182) he tooke Roha – except <a id="l404"></a>that the Sultan of Mausil towards the end of the 5<sup>t</sup> Tr. recovered Senjar with the adjacent <a id="l405"></a>regions with in which I suppose was also Nisibis.  [And so open to the enemy was Maredin layed by this skirting of it that it was afterwards after besieged as by  Saladin A.C <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; then by his brother Adel A.C. <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; again <a id="l408"></a>AC <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>. And so much was Maredin skirted on that side by this invasion  &amp; layd  open to the <a id="l409"></a> enemy that it was afterwards often besieged: as by Saladin A.C. 1183 &amp; by his bro<a id="l410"></a>ther Adel A.C.  1198 &amp; again A.C. 1203.] [proceeding to besiege even Maredin  <a id="l411"></a>it self, as did also his brother Adel after him  ofner then once.

                <p id="par71">These two sultanies therefore being rejected there remains  for the four <a id="l415"></a>angels the Sultanies of Asia, Syria, Mausel, &amp; Miepharekin. The Sultany of <a id="l416"></a>Asia was watered by a large arm of Euphrates passing through the middle of it <a id="l417"></a>&amp; not only so but bordered upon the main channel  towards the time of loosing <a id="l418"></a>for then &amp; for <span class="hspac-n" title="4 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> years before – to Armenia major. The Sultany of Syria <a id="l419"></a>was not only adjacent to the river but at the time of loosing extended a good way <a id="l420"></a>into Mesopotamia. The Sultany of Mausel was watered by the River Alchabur (or Harnas) a large <a id="l421"></a>arme of Euphrates &amp; bordered also upon the  Euphrates it self for Mausel it self thoug <a id="l422"></a>situate upon Tigris, yet was distant but about one or two little days journey from one <a id="l423"></a>of the streams.  Miepharekin  was indeed something <a id="l424"></a>further from Euphr. namely about 5 days journey or 125 Italian miles (Geogr. Nubisusis clim 5 pars 5) <a id="l425"></a>but yet it was nearer to it then Maredin by two days journey at least, &amp;  in <a id="l426"></a>all probably extended its jurisdiction to Euphrates for it was guirded on the <a id="l427"></a>north by the kingdom of Armenia which in the end of the 5<sup>t</sup> Tr was pretty powerful <a id="l428"></a> &amp; on the south east by the Sultany of Maredin those metropol<span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>s <a id="l429"></a> being  scarce above  three days journey distant from one another <a id="l430"></a>&amp; yet that it was a powerful Sultany &amp; consequently of large extent towards the other quarters  is manifest by the defiance which its Sultan <a id="l431"></a>(as Pharajus informs us bad to the Tartars even  when they had newly sacked Bagdad. [* For it's chief ex<a id="l432"></a>tent was that way as may be collected from hence that it was <a id="l433"></a>founded by the conquests of Saladin which extended from Eufrates to this city <a id="l434"></a>but not much farther. It comprehended Ameda with its territory (Pharajus) &amp; so lay partly between Maredin &amp; Eufrates. It was guirded on the north – sacked bagdad.  And as in the <a id="l435"></a>reign of Saladin &amp; his successor Adel it was united to Syria under one supreme Sultan <a id="l436"></a> so still at the end of the fift Tr. it bordered upon the Syrian Sultany as may appear <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>from<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span> hence that its sultan Ashrat after the sacking of Bagdad went into Syria to  consult with the Sultan thereof about their common <a id="l437"></a>safety &amp; mutual aid. And if it extended to the Syrian Sultany much more should it extend <a id="l438"></a>to  that of Asia which lay over against it on the other side the river, for I <a id="l439"></a>read not of any other Sultany between them. I may further add that its regions <a id="l440"></a>were watered by a large river which flows out of the mountains of Armenia &amp;  joyns with the main channel of Euphrates be<a id="l442"></a>low Samoset. (Geogr. Nub. Clim 5. Part 5)</p> 
                <p id="par72">These four Sultanies therefore  were all seated upon Euphrates &amp; so fitly answer to the <a id="l443"></a>4 angels bound in that river. But there is another character of them which notably confirms <a id="l444"></a>this determination for by the 4<sup>th</sup> condition of this Tr.   their Metropoles were to  resemble a 4 <a id="l445"></a>square position . And  behold here theire position how nearly it appoaches that figure.  □ reccon<a id="l446"></a> here Damascus the chief seat of Syria becaus it had been ever so &amp; at  time of <a id="l447"></a>loosing the Angels the Sultan resided there.</p>

                <p id="par74">After this Ashraf the Sultan of Miepharekin went the same year into Syria to <a id="l448"></a>Naser Sultan thereof to desire aid of him whereby the Tartars might be kept out <a id="l449"></a>of Syria, but Naser not hearkening to him he returned in anger  &amp; <a id="l450"></a>when he came to Miepharekin ejected the praæfects of the Tartars &amp; crucified a <a id="l451"></a>certain Priest sent to him with commands from the great Chan.
