And now they were soon repulsed by Gratian &amp; forced <a id="l176"></a>to return to their obedience again in Pannonia. This was when The<a id="l177"></a>odosius lay sick at Thessalonica.</p>
<p id="par11">To these I may add also a commotion threatned by the Burgund<a id="l178"></a>ians, <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> who in the year 380 being invited by Valentinian <a id="l179"></a>against the Alemans &amp; disobliged by breach of covenant, went <a id="l180"></a>back  in anger &amp; after three years returned again <a id="l181"></a>with almost eighty thousand to the side of the Rhene with intention <a id="l182"></a>to have invaded the Empire. But Valentinian <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup>sending Gratian <a id="l183"></a>against them their incursion was stayed for the present. Yet <a id="l184"></a>they returned not back but seated themselves  <a id="l185"></a>by the River untill the appointed time. Ierom at the end of <a id="l186"></a>Eusebius's Chronicle expresses the action thus. Anno 374 Burgundi<a id="l187"></a>onum octoginta fermè millia, quot nunquam ante, ad <a id="l188"></a>Rhenum descenderunt. And this I thought fit to mention <a id="l189"></a>here becaus though not an actual war yet it is a prepa<a id="l190"></a>ration to those wars that are hereafter to break forth &amp; <a id="l191"></a>therefore may be recconed among the winds that are at present <a id="l192"></a>checked.</p>
<p id="par12">I have now shown you how the winds rose after the death of Constantine &amp; blew more &amp; more from every qter upon the Empire till they almost <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>overturnd<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> it, but then were - blew &amp; were check<a id="l193"></a>ed  by the Angels in every quarter, &amp; so the <a id="l194"></a>Empire by the ceasing of these warlike blusterings &amp; noises reduced to <a id="l195"></a>an universal  tranquility, &amp; silence: which commenc<a id="l196"></a>ing at the year 380, shows that we must  date the se<a id="l197"></a>venth Seale from thence. And this being established, you <a id="l198"></a>shall hear in the next Proposition how the winds are again <a id="l199"></a>let loos in order to blow upon the Empire till they consume it.</p>

<p id="par13">As the four first seales were introduced by the four beasts <a id="l210"></a>which stood about the four quarters of the throne: so these four <a id="l211"></a>Trumpets are introduced by the four angels which stand at <a id="l212"></a>the four corners of the earth.

<p id="par15">Having premised these things of the winds, I should now proceed to describe <a id="l227"></a>the wars of the Trump<sup>ts</sup> which they signify. But first there are some <a id="l228"></a>other wars between them &amp; the half howers silence to be taken <a id="l229"></a>notis of. ffor the fire of the Altar which the Angel with his censer cast on the <a id="l230"></a>earth (Def <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Psal &amp; the  consequent voices &amp; thundrings &amp; lightnings &amp; <a id="l231"></a>shaking (Def <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ) are all expressions of war. Now this war has these <a id="l232"></a>four characters. ffirst it is the war which puts an end to the time of silence <a id="l233"></a>2 Because the wars of the Trumpets are expressed by winds which lie <a id="l234"></a>still during this war, therefore this war must be of a different kind. <a id="l235"></a>Suppose the difference be that this is civil &amp; the other with a forreign <a id="l236"></a>enemy; ffor winds blowing upon an Empire are the most proper <a id="l237"></a>representative of wars made by invaders. 3 This is to be such <a id="l238"></a>a war as is accompanied with the overthrow of some dominion. <a id="l239"></a>ffor so the <em class="underline">shaking</em> signifies. 4 It is to be in a time which has <a id="l240"></a>a very great affinity with the time of silence; so that both those times <a id="l241"></a>together may make one uniform revolution, excepting so far as <a id="l242"></a>they are discriminated by this war in the latter part of it. And <a id="l243"></a>the reason of this is becaus both together make up the whole <a id="l244"></a>time expressed by the performance of divine rights in chap 8 <a id="l245"></a>&amp; by the sealing of the Saints in chap 7.</p>
<p id="par16">These are the characters of the war which is to precede the <a id="l246"></a>Trumpets &amp; these lead us to the memorable civil wars of Theo<a id="l247"></a>dosius with Maximus &amp; Eugenius. ffor those put an end to the <a id="l248"></a>peace signified by the half howers silence, &amp; were civile, &amp; <a id="l249"></a>overthrew the Dominions of Maximus &amp; Eugenius, &amp; together <a id="l250"></a>with the time of silence made up that singular &amp; pretty uniform <a id="l251"></a>period of time during the reign of Theodosius, which ended with <a id="l252"></a>the division of the Empire &amp; new irruptions of the Barbarians.</p>
<p id="par17">Now these wars I reccon to begin about May or Iune A.D. <a id="l253"></a>388. ffor between that &amp; the year 380, I cannot meet with so <a id="l254"></a>much as one battel fought within the Empire. Gratian indeed in <a id="l255"></a>the year 383 when Maximus first rebelled led his Army against <a id="l256"></a>him, but having formerly disobliged his soldiers <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> they fell off from  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006v"> &lt;6v&gt; </span>him &amp; Maximus,<sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> insomuch that after the Armies had been only five days <a id="l257"></a>within sight of one another, he fled out of despair without <a id="l258"></a>giving battel, &amp; in his flight was <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> slain at  Leyden by <a id="l259"></a>the treachery of Andragatius: &amp; Maximus succeeded in his <a id="l260"></a>part of the Empire, residing at Trevirs &amp; ruling over Gallia <a id="l261"></a>Spain &amp; Brittain by the consent of Theodosius &amp; Valen<a id="l262"></a>tinian.</p>
<p id="par18">After this there came in the year 386 a great hand <a id="l263"></a>of the Thuringians under the conduct of Odotheus from remote norther regions <a id="l264"></a>to the side of the Danube. But Theodosius hearing beforehand of their coming, <a id="l265"></a>lead his Army against them, &amp; getting intelligence of their councell about passing <a id="l266"></a>the river, <sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> set upon them unawares in their passage with such ships as he had in readiness <a id="l267"></a>&amp; destroyed most of them upon the river. This indeed was a battel but <a id="l268"></a>not within the Empire, nor did the enemy otherwise then captivated come <a id="l269"></a>within the bounds of the Empire to disturb its tranquility: &amp; therefore we are <a id="l270"></a>not to look upon this as an interruption of the time of silence. We may rather <a id="l271"></a>esteem it a wind checked in its first indeavour then suffered to blow.</p>
<p id="par19">The next year Maximus being desirous to inlarge his dominion into Italy, whilst <a id="l272"></a>he pretended peace led his Army secretly over the Alps: &amp; Valentinian sur<a id="l273"></a>prised by the unexpectedness of the action left his dominions to the invader, <a id="l274"></a>&amp; fled by sea to Theodosius. Whereupon Theodosius prepared for war <a id="l275"></a>&amp; the next year advancing towards Italy, first meets with Maximus <a id="l276"></a>at Sciscia &amp; in a set battel beats him there, &amp; then pursuing him  <a id="l277"></a>towards Italy, meets &amp; beats his Brother Marcellin at Petavion in another <a id="l278"></a>battel. After which he goes to Aquileia whither Maximus was fled &amp; besieges <a id="l279"></a>him there, &amp; sends Arbogastes into Gallia against his son whom he had</p>
<p id="par20"><sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> <a id="l282"></a>created Cæsar &amp; left at Trevirs; &amp; within a while both of them are slain, <a id="l283"></a>the soldiers of Maximus delivering him bound to Thodosius. <a id="l284"></a>This was a manifest &amp; notable civil war &amp; therefore the peri<a id="l285"></a>od of the half howers silence. And the war with Eugeni<a id="l286"></a>us &amp; Arbogastes was like this: which being ended, Theodo<a id="l287"></a>sius now sole Emperor, fell sick at Millain &amp;  <a id="l288"></a>left the Empire in <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup> an universal tranquility, divided between <a id="l289"></a>his sons  giving the East to Arcadius &amp; the west <a id="l290"></a>to Honorius.</p>
<p id="par21">This I take to be the revolution of time expressed by the <a id="l291"></a>performance of holy rites: which being explained I now <a id="l292"></a>proceed to expound the Trump<sup>ts</sup>. And with them I shall <a id="l293"></a>jointly consider the Vials becaus they are collaterall <a id="l294"></a>&amp; both together make up one complete prophesy, the one <a id="l295"></a>supplying what is sometimes wanting in the <a id="l296"></a>other.</p><span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 5r resumes &gt; </span>

And going thence <a id="l351"></a>by Thessaly into  Achaia, he  rased all cities in his way but <a id="l352"></a>Thebes &amp; Athens.

<p id="par34">** I said that Rome was the Metropolis of the third part of the Roman <a id="l468"></a>Sea: for the understanding of which you are to know that Theodosius <a id="l469"></a>at his death divided the Roman dominions into two Empires between <a id="l470"></a>his sons Arcadius &amp; Honorius making Constantinople the seat of the <a id="l471"></a>Eastern Empire &amp; Rome of the Western, &amp; that the western is about <a id="l472"></a>the third part of the whole. ffor dividing the whole into three <a id="l473"></a>equall parts according to the length of it; Mesopotamia Armenia, <a id="l474"></a>Syria Arabia &amp; Palestine amount to about one third part: <a id="l475"></a>Egypt, Asia, Thrace, Grece, &amp; Illyricum to another: &amp; Afric <a id="l476"></a>Pannonia, Italy, Gallia, Spain &amp; Brittain to the third.

<p id="par70">Now the effect of these wars is that a great star fell <a id="l743"></a>from heaven burning as it were a Lamp; that is<sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup> some very great Prince from the heaven of his dignity consuming by war. And this points <sup class="note" id="n39-ref">[39]</sup> at the fall <a id="l744"></a>of the western Cæsar, who from that time that the Vandals <a id="l745"></a>rent Afric &amp; the Mediterranean Islands from the Empire &amp; <a id="l746"></a>spoiled Rome &amp; Italy, retained almost nothing but the name<a id="l747"></a>of Emperor: insomuch that some historians make that  <a id="l748"></a>time the end of this Empire. Yet it resisted absolute death <a id="l749"></a>for about twenty years longer under the titular Cæsars <a id="l750"></a>Avitus, Majoranus, Severus Anthemitis, Olybrius, Glycerius <a id="l751"></a>&amp; Nepos falling by the sword of one another untill at last A.D. 476 it was utterly extinguish<a id="l752"></a>ed under the fatal name of Augustus  or Augustulus by Odoacer King <a id="l753"></a>of the Heruli who being invited by some of the Italians translated his nation into Italy.</p>
<p id="par71">The reason why I interpret this star of no less dignity <a id="l754"></a>then that of the Western Emperor is becaus it is described of the <a id="l755"></a>greatest magnitude, &amp; whilst there are two Emperors in the <a id="l756"></a>Roman world, it would be against nature to represent them by <a id="l757"></a>suns. Yet least you should  doubt of this interpretation  you may compare it with Isa 14 12 where the fall <a id="l759"></a>of as great a Monarch as ye King of Babylon,  becaus he had in like manner the king of the Medes for his <a id="l760"></a> fellow , is <a id="l761"></a>expressed by the like Parable of a falling star. How art <a id="l762"></a>thou fallen  from heaven O Lucifer son of the <a id="l763"></a>morning saith the Prophet, how art thou cut down to the ground <a id="l764"></a>which didst weaken the nations.</p>

<p id="par75">These wars (besides some others of less note) since <a id="l837"></a>they conduced very much to the bloodying of the western <a id="l838"></a>rivers may not unjustly be recconed among the wars <a id="l839"></a>to which the 3<sup>d</sup> Trumpet sounded. But then you will <a id="l840"></a>perhaps object: How can the wars of this Trumpet <a id="l841"></a>be esteemed a southern wind since they happened as well <a id="l842"></a>in other quarters? To which I answer j That the <a id="l843"></a>four winds are not to be taken so stricktly that while <a id="l844"></a>they blow there shall be wars in none but the car<a id="l845"></a>dinal quarter. It is enough that the principal war is in <a id="l846"></a>that quarter; &amp; therefore when there are divers wars <a id="l847"></a>together, the quarter is to be estimated by the principal.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span>  such was the Vandalic war. For though the wars of <a id="l848"></a>Attila were  wonderfully violent for the time, yet <a id="l849"></a> he kept in no quarter  that he invaded as the Vandals did in Afric but <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> from east to west.  his wars were also very short being  in the western <a id="l850"></a>Empire but of two or three years continuance, ; whereas the Vandalic war lasted 70 years <a id="l853"></a>together &amp; upward without any considerable intermission, &amp; was <a id="l854"></a> much more pernicious to the Empire that depriving the Empire of no one Province but this rending away all Afric with Sicily &amp; most of the Mediterranean Isles, besides the frequent Pyratical invasions of all european countries bordering upon the Mediterranean &amp; amongst other spoiles the carrying away the immens treasures of Rome &amp; other chief Cities of Italy  with the flower of their youth &amp; Gentry which was of so fatall consequence that the Empire never lookt up afterward, , &amp;  some reccon this the period of the Empire as if the following Emperors were Emperors over nothing. The wars of Attila therefore cannot be accounted the principal wind but may rather for their shortness violence &amp; uncertain quarter,  be compared to a whirlwind or Hurricane. 2<sup>dly</sup> In reccon<a id="l855"></a>ing up the four winds we are to regard only such <a id="l856"></a>winds as blow upon the Empire, that is such wars <a id="l857"></a>as are waged by the Barbarians not against one <a id="l858"></a>another but against the Romans. And this excludes <a id="l859"></a>almost all the above mentioned wars except the Vandalic. For the wars of the Ostrogoths were not  <a id="l860"></a>against the Empire but first against the Huns &amp; then <a id="l861"></a>against the Heruli. Nor was the great Army of Attila <a id="l862"></a>at first designed against the Empire <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n51-ref">[51]</sup> but against the <a id="l863"></a>Visigoths, he being sollicited by the Vandals to invade <a id="l864"></a>them. But becaus Ætius the General of the Emperor <a id="l865"></a>(fearing least after he had subdued the western <a id="l866"></a>barbarian kingdoms one after another he should <a id="l867"></a>turn upon the Empire) ingaged together with all <a id="l868"></a>those kingdoms against him, therefore in revenge he <a id="l869"></a>turned his fury upon the Romans, &amp; this was the se<a id="l870"></a>cond summer only. And as for the translation of <a id="l871"></a>the kingdom of the Heruli into Italy, whereby the <a id="l872"></a> race of Emperors  ceased, that was done <a id="l873"></a>without any memorable war, Odoacer being called in <a id="l874"></a>by some of the Italians.</p>
<p id="par76">There may be another objection, namely that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span> Vandalic nation whilst in Spain concurred with <a id="l875"></a>the other barbarous nations to constitute the western <a id="l876"></a>wind, &amp; therefore the southern wind ought not also <a id="l877"></a>to be derived from them but from some other <a id="l878"></a>nation &amp; rather from a southern nation (as the <a id="l879"></a>Moors,  especially since they were in the wind when they blew altogether before the angels held them) then <a id="l881"></a>from the Vandals who came from the north. But <a id="l882"></a>this is easily answered by considering the nature of <a id="l883"></a>winds: ffor the same air accordingly as it moves <a id="l884"></a>this way or that way may constitute a wind one <a id="l885"></a>while in one quarter &amp; afterwards in another quar<a id="l886"></a>ter; &amp; so the same Vandalic nation accordingly <a id="l887"></a>as they war in divers quarters may constitute <a id="l888"></a>divers  figurative winds. And as we denominate <a id="l889"></a>a wind in this or that quarter only from the present <a id="l890"></a>motion without considering from what country the <a id="l891"></a>Air came originally, so we are here not to regard <a id="l892"></a>from whence the Vandals came originally but only <a id="l893"></a>in what quarter they war at present. And for the same <a id="l894"></a>reason it is not material whither the nations which now <a id="l895"></a>successively constitute the 4 winds be the same with those <a id="l896"></a>which constituted them when they blew all together before <a id="l897"></a>the angels held them. It is enough that they break <a id="l898"></a>forth in the 4 quarters wherein they blew before, though <a id="l899"></a>the Air be changed. And hence in the next Trumpet <a id="l900"></a>because the successive wars of the Goths &amp; Lombards were <a id="l901"></a>in the same quarter, I consider them but as one &amp; the <a id="l902"></a>same wind notwithstanding the diversity of the <a id="l903"></a>Nations.</p>

<p id="par77">The last blast of the third wind we may reccon to <a id="l904"></a>be that notable war wherein the Vandalic kingdom was <a id="l905"></a>overthrown by Bellisarius: which happend in the years <a id="l906"></a>533 &amp; 534. And this directs us to the fourth wind, <a id="l907"></a>that famous Ostrogothic war which began the next year (between <a id="l908"></a>the Romans &amp; Barbarians) whose main seat was on the <a id="l909"></a>north of Rome, the quarter of this wind: ffor the main <a id="l910"></a>seat thereof was Venetia &amp; Lombardy with the other <a id="l911"></a>regions between Rome &amp; the Alps, besides some actions in <a id="l912"></a>Illyricum; &amp; the duration was first ✝<sup class="note" id="n52-ref">[52]</sup> about  20 or 21 years  with <a id="l921"></a>the Goths, in which the Lombards  aided the Romans, <a id="l922"></a>&amp; a<sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> then  37 or 38 years  more withthe Lombards almost <a id="l923"></a>without intermission.

<p id="par78">Between these wars <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n54-ref">[54]</sup> there was also  a war with the Heruli under Sindual in Tuscia; of whome <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n55-ref">[55]</sup> Anastasius says, peremibant cunctam Italiam. But this I mention only as a copula of the years before &amp; after.</p>
<p id="par79">In the former Trumpet you had the fall of the <a id="l929"></a>Western Cæsar, but this proceeds yet higher, even <a id="l930"></a>to the darkning of the Sun Moon &amp; Stars, that is to <a id="l931"></a>the utter extinction of the remaining light of the <a id="l932"></a>Western Empire: ffor the understanding of which you <a id="l933"></a>are to know that the Empire was fundamentally seated, not <a id="l934"></a>in the Dominion of the Emperour, but in that of the <a id="l935"></a>city of Rome.

<p id="par80">But though it could not recover them yet it continued <a id="l939"></a>for some time after the fall of the Cæsars to shine con<a id="l940"></a>siderably. The Consulship Odoacer indeed at first took <a id="l941"></a>away in anger, but after two years restored it &amp; conserved <a id="l942"></a>it to the end of his reign: &amp; then Theoderic King of the <a id="l943"></a>Ostrogoths being sent by Zenon the Greek Emperor against <a id="l944"></a>Odoacer &amp; having conquered &amp; slain him, besides Dal<a id="l945"></a>matia &amp; Rhætia which were Odoacer's Provinces he added <a id="l946"></a>Sicily &amp; ✝<sup class="note" id="n56-ref">[56]</sup> all Alemannia to his dominions &amp; freed Italy with the rest of his <a id="l947"></a>Kingdoms from the incursions of the Vandals &amp; setled it <a id="l948"></a>in peace. ✝<sup class="note" id="n57-ref">[57]</sup> So far was the dominion of Italy restored by <a id="l955"></a>his coming that Ennodius in his Panegyric to him said: <a id="l956"></a>Interea ad limitem suum Romana Regna remearunt. <a id="l957"></a>He <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n58-ref">[58]</sup> repaired also the wals of Rome &amp;  other buildings <a id="l992"></a>with a great summ of money given for that purpose &amp; <a id="l993"></a>changed no custom but retained the Senate, Consuls, Patricij,<a id="l994"></a>Prætors, Quæstors, Præfects of the City, Masters of the hors <a id="l995"></a>&amp; foot &amp; other offices which had been in the times of the <a id="l996"></a>Emperors, &amp; assigned  these Roman dignities only to  the Romans <a id="l997"></a>, as did also the succeeding Ostrogothic Kings Atha<a id="l998"></a>laric &amp; Theodatus.

<p id="par82">Thus was the Imperial City, which formerly shone glori<a id="l1034"></a>ously with her Consuls Senate &amp; other dignities reduced into <a id="l1035"></a>darknes, being made a heap of runs, &amp; deprived of her <a id="l1036"></a>Magistracy, &amp; from being Queen of the world degraded <a id="l1037"></a>to I know not what ignoble Dukedom, &amp; compel'd to <a id="l1038"></a>serve under Ravenna which formerly served under her, <a id="l1039"></a>&amp; (O darknes!) even to pay tribute to the Exarchs <a id="l1040"></a>presiding there.</p>
<p id="par83">This was the conclusion of this great Empire: <a id="l1041"></a>concerning which I cannot but note that it was  <a id="l1042"></a>accomplished by the direst desolations that (I beleive) <a id="l1043"></a>ever nation felt: God reserving his most grievous scourge <a id="l1044"></a>for the fountain of Apostacy &amp; the most grievous part <a id="l1045"></a>of that scourge for the last place to try the utmost be<a id="l1046"></a>fore he would give over an incorrigible insensible <a id="l1047"></a>people.

<p id="par86">Of the wars in other places which Gregory here <a id="l1134"></a>touches upon, those made by the Hunns invading Illy<a id="l1135"></a>ricum Occidentale &amp; Orientale &amp; Thrace (regions situate <a id="l1136"></a>to the Northeast of Rome as the seat of the Lombardic <a id="l1137"></a>wars inclined to the north west) were the most grievous <a id="l1138"></a>&amp; lasting. They continued from the year 539 to the <a id="l1139"></a>year 558 &amp; downward with notable violence &amp; soon after brake forth again. And these with what others there were <a id="l1140"></a>at this time within the Roman world may be in general referred to <a id="l1141"></a>this Trumpet, but the first place must be allowed to <a id="l1142"></a>the Lombardic as the direst wars &amp; those by which the <a id="l1143"></a>effect of this Trumpet, that is the extinction of the <a id="l1144"></a>western Empire was accomplished.</p>

<p id="par94">The correspondent Vial too confirms its' application notably.

For the Greek Emperor (the supreme terrestri<a id="l1267"></a>al Potentate) was the cause of the wars of this Trumpet by sending <a id="l1268"></a>his armies into Italy in pursuit of his claim to those regions.

<p id="par96">The conditions of the fift Trumpet are these <a id="l1298"></a>1. It is to begin with the rise of a new fals <a id="l1299"></a>religion: ffor this the ascention of any thing out <a id="l1300"></a>of the bottomless pit implies. To rise out of the <a id="l1301"></a>sea or earth is a phrase accommodated to expres <a id="l1302"></a>the rise of temporal dominions without respect to <a id="l1303"></a>religion, but to rise out of the bottomless pit ex<a id="l1304"></a>presses further the bringing up some infernal de<a id="l1305"></a>vises together with that dominion which arises. Thus <a id="l1306"></a>the ten horned beast is said to rise out of the <a id="l1307"></a>bottomless pit (chap 11.7. &amp; 17.8) becaus he was to <a id="l1308"></a>rise together with the great Antichristian Apostacy. <a id="l1309"></a>And so in chap 20 to express the ceasing of <a id="l1310"></a>fals religions for a 1000 years &amp; afterds their <a id="l1311"></a>springing up again, the Dragon is said to be cast <a id="l1312"></a>into the bottomles pit that he should deceive the <a id="l1313"></a>nations no more till after the 1000 years &amp; then <a id="l1314"></a>to be let out again to deceive them.</p>
<p id="par97">2. This fals religion is to rise at  <a id="l1315"></a>the  end of the 4<sup>th</sup> Trumpet. For this <a id="l1316"></a>the order of the Trumpets requires. Yet between the contents of these two Trumpets some little intervall may be allowed answering to the space taken up by the flight of the Angel through heaven which cryed Wo.</p>
<p id="par98">3.

They are therefore not real Locusts but <a id="l1333"></a>men &amp; not peaceable men but such as are hurt<a id="l1334"></a>full to others. Moreover it is said that they were <a id="l1335"></a>like unto horses prepared unto battel, &amp; had faces like <a id="l1336"></a>men (i.e. were horsmen,) &amp; had breastplates as it <a id="l1337"></a>were of iron, &amp; the sound of their wings was as the <a id="l1338"></a>sound of chariots of many horses running to battel. <a id="l1339"></a>And to represent them the more pernicious &amp; dreadfull <a id="l1340"></a>they are said to have tailes like Scorpions with stings <a id="l1341"></a>in them, &amp; teeth as the teeth of Lyons, both which <a id="l1342"></a>are also of a <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n87-ref">[87]</sup>pugnacious military signification by Def <a id="l1343"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Locusts therefore are soldiers: &amp; <a id="l1344"></a>since they come out of the Smoke, the smoke which <a id="l1345"></a>(by Def <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) signifies a multitude must be the whole <a id="l1346"></a>multitude of the followers of this new religion.</p>
<p id="par99">4. The professors of this new religion are <a id="l1347"></a>to constitute a kingdom. ffor it is exprest that they <a id="l1348"></a>have a king over them.</p>
<p id="par100">5 Their king is the same with the Author  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p033r"> &lt;33r&gt; </span> &amp; Guardian of their religion. ffor he is called the angel <a id="l1349"></a>of the bottomless pit, that is,  He (with his successors) to <a id="l1350"></a>whom power over the pit was given, who a little before <a id="l1351"></a>was exprest by the star which fell from heaven to whom <a id="l1352"></a>was given the key of the bottomles pit that he should <a id="l1353"></a>open it. Their king is therefore both a spirituall <a id="l1354"></a>&amp; temporall Prince: a temporall prince as he is King <a id="l1355"></a>over the Locusts, that is chief commander over soldiers, <a id="l1356"></a>&amp; a spirituall prince as he is the angel of the bottom<a id="l1357"></a>less pit.</p>
<p id="par101">6. This King is further described by his name, <a id="l1358"></a>which in hebrew is said to be <em class="underline">Abaddon</em> &amp; in greek <a id="l1359"></a><em class="underline">Apollyon</em>: both which words signifying the same thing <a id="l1360"></a>namely a <em class="underline">Destroyer</em>, it is to be supposed that there <a id="l1361"></a>is some further mystery in the hebrew word then the <a id="l1362"></a>bare signification. ffor it is not likely that the holy <a id="l1363"></a>Ghost would make an excursion into the hebrew tongue <a id="l1364"></a>for a mere tautology.</p>
<p id="par102">7. The  Locusts were to be a people <a id="l1365"></a>with long hair &amp; with some ornament upon their heads <a id="l1366"></a>resembling a crown; in that they are said to have <a id="l1367"></a>crowns of gold &amp; hair like weomen.</p>
<p id="par103">They were to be enemies of the Roman state <a id="l1368"></a>ffor the Trumpets are alarms to so many plagues of <a id="l1369"></a>war upon the Romans, whereof this inflicted by the <a id="l1370"></a>Locusts is one. Those whom the Locusts torment <a id="l1371"></a>are described to be the men which had not the seal <a id="l1372"></a>of God in their foreheads, that is those which stand in <a id="l1373"></a>opposition to the sealed saints, or which had the mark <a id="l1374"></a>of the Beast. And acording the fift vial (which ex<a id="l1375"></a>presses the same thing with this seal) is said to be pou<a id="l1376"></a>red upon the seat of the Beast. It is the Beast there-  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p034r"> &lt;34r&gt; </span> fore, that is the Roman state, on which the plague of <a id="l1377"></a>this Vial &amp; Trumpet  is inflicted, &amp; consequently <a id="l1378"></a>the Locusts are their enemies.</p>
<p id="par104">9. They were not to kill men but torment <a id="l1379"></a>them only; that is  to afflict kingdoms by war but not utterly <a id="l1381"></a>to ruin them. ffor here by the killing of men is to be understood not the killing of single men but of Kingdoms as was explained above in the 2<sup>d</sup> Trump<sup>t</sup></p>
<p id="par105">10 They were to rage five months, that is, five <a id="l1382"></a>times thirty prophetique days or 150 years; &amp; this <a id="l1383"></a>repeated, vers 5 &amp; 10. ffor this repetition I cannot but <a id="l1384"></a>esteem rather mysterious then superfluous, especially <a id="l1385"></a>since there is not  any where in the prophetique <a id="l1386"></a>scriptures (that I know) such another  repetition in a continued <a id="l1387"></a>narration of the same type.</p>
<p id="par106">These are the conditions of this  Trumpet, &amp; they <a id="l1388"></a>singularly point out the Saracenical Kingdom. For</p>
<p id="par107">1. There have been since the writing of the Apo<a id="l1389"></a>calyps but two notable new fals religions of large extent <a id="l1390"></a>&amp; long duration, the Roman &amp; the Mahometan. And <a id="l1391"></a>so in the Prophesy of the Seales &amp; Trumpets there are <a id="l1392"></a>described but two states which arise out of the bottomless <a id="l1393"></a>pit, the Beast &amp; the Locusts. Wherefore since the Beast <a id="l1394"></a>is the Roman  state (as shall be further explained <a id="l1395"></a>hereafter,) it remains that the Locusts be the Mahometan.</p>
<p id="par108">2. The Mahometan is the religion which arose  at the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> Trumpet. <a id="l1397"></a>For  the darkness of the Sun Moon &amp; stars in that Trumpet continued till the year 609, . And in the year 609 the Mahometan <a id="l1401"></a>religion began to be hatched; as is manifest out of <a id="l1402"></a>Elmacinus who in the beginning of his history records that  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p035r"> &lt;35r&gt; </span> <sup class="note" id="n88-ref">[88]</sup> Mahomet was born in the year of <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> called to the  office of a Prophet in the Month <a id="l1403"></a>Rabie prior in the  end of the 40<sup>th</sup> year of his age, which was in the <a id="l1404"></a> 922<sup>d</sup> year of Alexander the great, &amp; that in the 44<sup>th</sup> <a id="l1405"></a>year of his age he began to manifest his vocation <a id="l1406"></a>having before invited only privatly to Islamism (as <a id="l1407"></a>they call their religion,) &amp; in the  14<sup>th</sup> year of his vo<a id="l1408"></a>cation &amp; 54<sup>th</sup> year of his age (namely in the very beginning of those years) he fled to Medina <a id="l1409"></a>entring the City on the 12<sup>t</sup> day of the same month <a id="l1410"></a>Rabie prior: from which flight the Æra of the Hegira <a id="l1411"></a>begins the first year thereof being the same with the 54 of Mahomet. Wherefore both by the  922 year of Alexander which began in september A.C. 609 &amp; in whose first month the month Rabie prior began &amp; by the Æra of the Hegi<a id="l1413"></a>ra, which by the common consent of Chronologers began <a id="l1414"></a>Iuly 17 A.C. 622,   <a id="l1415"></a>the Mahometan religion took its beginning in autumn in the year  of our Lord 609. </p>
<p id="par109">** ** The same is also evident out of  Abul Pharajius history who writes that Mahomet was born in the year of Alexander 882 &amp; died  in the beginning of the 11<sup>th</sup> year of the Hegira having lived 63 years whereof 40 were spent before he arrogated to himself  his prophetique function, 13 years more whilst he was at Mecha &amp; the last 10 years  at Medina after the Hegira . Sic et in Tractatu  ejus de origine et moribus gentium Arabum scribit Mahometeum post com<span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span></p>
<p id="par110">Supposing therefore Mahomet (the Angel of the <a id="l1421"></a>bottomless pit) to be the star which fell from heaven <a id="l1422"></a>to the Earth &amp; opened the pit; we may reccon that <a id="l1423"></a>he fell from heaven in the year 609 when he <a id="l1424"></a>first began to contrive his doctrine, &amp; consequently <a id="l1425"></a>from thence date this Trumpet; &amp; that in the year <a id="l1426"></a>612 when he first manifested his pretended vocati<a id="l1427"></a>on, he began to open the pit &amp; let out the smoke; <a id="l1428"></a>&amp; that in the years 622 &amp; 623, when (as the same Elmacinus writes) he first armed his follow<a id="l1429"></a>ers, the Locusts began to come out of the smoke.</p>
<p id="par111">3. The great multitude of these Locusts is noto<a id="l1430"></a>riously  conspicuous; their kingdom being as large <a id="l1431"></a>as the Roman Empire in its greatest extent &amp; their ar<a id="l1432"></a>mies far more numerous.</p><span class="pagenumber" id="p036r"> &lt;36r&gt; </span> 
<p id="par112">4 &amp; 5. Also the qualities of their king, that he should <a id="l1433"></a>be both angel of the bottomless pit &amp; king of the Locusts <a id="l1434"></a>do singularly agree to Mahomet &amp; the succeeding race <a id="l1435"></a>of Califas, who founded &amp; propagated as well their <a id="l1436"></a>religion as their Empire, being Princes both spiritu<a id="l1437"></a>all &amp; temporall in the strictest sence. Nor hath there <a id="l1438"></a>been, that I know, any other considerable Prince to whom <a id="l1439"></a>this character so well agrees. The Pope indeed comes near<a id="l1440"></a>est to it, being such another spirituall Prince among <a id="l1441"></a>Christians as the Califa was among Mahometans, but in <a id="l1442"></a>temporall power he falls  thus far short, that <a id="l1443"></a>although he claims &amp; exercises superiority over kings <a id="l1444"></a>yet he never had the absolute command of their <a id="l1445"></a>armies. He never appeared in the head of an army <a id="l1446"></a>like Mahomet &amp; the Califas &amp; therefore cannot be <a id="l1447"></a>called King of Locusts.</p>
<p id="par113">6. As for this Kings name Abaddon it seems to <a id="l1448"></a>allude to the common name of the ancient Kings of that <a id="l1449"></a>tract of Arabia from whence the Saracenical King<a id="l1450"></a>dom I conceive took its beginning: which tract from an ancient king <a id="l1451"></a><em class="underline">Obodas</em> (deified by his posterity) was called <em class="underline">Oboda</em>, &amp; the <a id="l1452"></a>Kings thereof <em class="underline">Obodas</em>, after the same manner that the <a id="l1453"></a>Kings of Egypt were called <em class="underline">Pharaoh</em> &amp; <em class="underline">Ptolome</em>, of <a id="l1454"></a>the Romans <em class="underline">Cæsars</em>, of the Parthians <em class="underline">Arsacæ</em>, &amp; of the <a id="l1455"></a>people bordering upon Arabia petrea <em class="underline">Arstæ</em>.</p>
<p id="par114">Concerning Obodas the deified King or God of the Arabians you <a id="l1456"></a>may see Tertullian ad Nat. l 2. c 8. &amp; the notes of <a id="l1457"></a>Gothofredus thereupon.

One of them was well known <a id="l1488"></a>to the Iews by his victory -<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 37r resumes &gt; </span>  the one well <a id="l1492"></a>known to the Iews by his victory over their king Alex<a id="l1493"></a>ander Iamneus whom that Arabian Obadas, having <a id="l1494"></a>slain his whole army in the region of Galaad, com<a id="l1495"></a>pelled to fly to Ierusalem about 90 years before Christ. <a id="l1496"></a>And him the Iews might well by a slight mutation have <a id="l1497"></a>called Abaddon, that is, the Destroyer. The other <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n90-ref">[90]</sup> Obodas <a id="l1498"></a>was in the time of Herod the great, in whom the line ended <a id="l1499"></a>for after his death the neighbouring King Aretas by the <a id="l1500"></a>favour of Augustus united his Kingdom to his own. <a id="l1501"></a>Of this Obodas Strabo also in the Arabic expedition of <a id="l1502"></a>Ætius Gallus makes mention; out of whom it may be <a id="l1503"></a>collected that the Kingdom Oboda bordered upon the red <a id="l1504"></a>Sea southward of Aretas's territories, where I suppose <a id="l1505"></a>Mahometism took its rise.</p>
<p id="par116">7. Moreover the shape of these Locusts, in that <a id="l1506"></a>they had hair like weomen &amp; crowns of gold, points <a id="l1507"></a>out the Arabians who, as Pliny writes, intonso utuntur <a id="l1508"></a>crine &amp; (<em class="underline">mulierum more</em>) mitrati degunt.

However it is not to <a id="l1517"></a>be doubted but Pliny had seen Arabians at Rome.</p>  <span class="pagenumber" id="p038r"> &lt;38r&gt; </span> 
<p id="par117">8. Again the Saracens Empire is further character<a id="l1518"></a>ised by their wars upon the Romans, in that the <a id="l1519"></a>Trumpets denote so many plagues inflicted upon the <a id="l1520"></a>Roman territories by war whereof the 5<sup>t</sup> is one of the <a id="l1521"></a>three greatest &amp; accordingly the wars of the Saracens <a id="l1522"></a>upon them hath been one of the most universal &amp; <a id="l1523"></a>lasting plagues which the Christian world hath hitherto felt. <a id="l1524"></a>As for the universality there is scarce any Roman <a id="l1525"></a>territory which hath not felt them, Syria, Egypt, Afric, <a id="l1526"></a>Spain, France, Italy, Illyricum, Grece, Thrace  <a id="l1527"></a>Asia &amp; Armenia. And the duration was much greater then of any <a id="l1528"></a>former plague.</p>
<p id="par118">9. The precise duration of this plague, exprest <a id="l1529"></a>to be five months, &amp; that  repated, I limit thus.</p>
<p id="par119">In the 13<sup>th</sup> year of the Hegira (which began March 7<sup>th</sup> <a id="l1530"></a>A.C. 634) the Saracens first entred Syria &amp; began <a id="l1531"></a>to make war upon the Romans as Elmacinus writes, <a id="l1532"></a>&amp; the next year in the month Regjebo (which was in <a id="l1533"></a>our September A.C. 635) they took Damascus &amp; made <a id="l1534"></a>it the seat of their Empire. And from the taking of <a id="l1535"></a>this City I date the beginning of their Empire as well <a id="l1536"></a>becaus it laid the foundation to their conquests (all Syria <a id="l1537"></a>&amp; Egypt together with the whole world like a flood follow<a id="l1538"></a>ing thereupon,) as becaus the holy spirit usually mea<a id="l1539"></a>sures the duration of Empires by that of the Metropolis.</p>
<p id="par120">Moreover the end of this Empire I put to be <a id="l1540"></a>in the year 936 when the Califa lost all temporall <a id="l1541"></a>power &amp; Bagdad (the new seat of the Empire) came <a id="l1542"></a>into the hands of temporal Princes. For this Kingdom <a id="l1543"></a>is not to be extended beyond the time that the angel <a id="l1544"></a>of the bottomless pit continued King of the Locusts. <a id="l1545"></a>Now that this downfall of the Califa was completed <a id="l1546"></a>in the year 936 is evident out of the same Elmacinus. <a id="l1547"></a>ffor having described before how the severall Provinces <a id="l1548"></a>of the Empire were rent from the Califa, so that (Egypt  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p039r"> &lt;39r&gt; </span>  in the last place being lost the year before) there <a id="l1549"></a>was now nothing left but Bagdad: he proceeds thus to <a id="l1550"></a>describe how Arradis the last absolute Califa subjected <a id="l1551"></a>both Bagdad &amp; himself to Muhammed one of the tem<a id="l1552"></a>poral Princes who had shared the Empire.

See Elmacinus lib 2. The time of <a id="l1645"></a>this translation I find not recorded, but it seems to have <a id="l1646"></a>been either at or before the year 775; for in that year <a id="l1647"></a>Mahad was there created Chalifa, his father Almansor <a id="l1648"></a>dying neare Mecca. Now the Empire being thus trans<a id="l1649"></a>lated from one seat to another, &amp; the holy Ghost mea<a id="l1650"></a>suring the duration of Empires by that of their Me<a id="l1651"></a>tropolis, it was  fit not to combine both these in one <a id="l1652"></a>number, but to express the duration of each apart: as <a id="l1653"></a>if he had said that the Empire should continue five months <a id="l1654"></a>at a seat, &amp; by the repetition thereof insinuated the duality <a id="l1655"></a>of seats. Tis true the duration of the Empire at these <a id="l1656"></a>two seats was not justly of this length, but the difference not being great it may <a id="l1657"></a>suffice that the last Dynasty exceeded five months as <a id="l1658"></a>much as the first fell short so that one with another <a id="l1659"></a>they may be recconed at 5 months a piece: perhaps <a id="l1660"></a>not much unlike Locusts which according to the condition <a id="l1661"></a>of the year may sometimes continue longer then <a id="l1662"></a>five months &amp; sometimes not so long, &amp; yet their life  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p042r"> &lt;42r&gt; </span>  one yeare with another be recconed at five months, <a id="l1663"></a>if at one time they exceed that continuance as <a id="l1664"></a>much as they fall short of it at another.</p>
<p id="par127">10. In the last place whereas it is said that the Lo<a id="l1665"></a>custs should torment men but not kill them, I suppose <a id="l1666"></a>it is spoken  to distinguish them from the  Euphra<a id="l1667"></a>tean horsmen who in the next Trumpet killed the 3<sup>d</sup> <a id="l1668"></a>part of men, that is overthrew the Constantinopolitan <a id="l1669"></a>Empire as I shall explain in its place: whereas these <a id="l1670"></a>Locusts though they often harassed the  whole Empire <a id="l1671"></a>with fire &amp; sword, &amp; beseiged Constantinople no less <a id="l1672"></a>then 8 times, &amp; that sometimes for two or three <a id="l1673"></a>years together, reducing the inhabitants to so great <a id="l1674"></a>straits that they came even to man's flesh, yet they <a id="l1675"></a>could not take the city, </p>

<h2 id="hd8" class="cent">Prop. <a id="l1676"></a><br>The sixt Trumpet conteins the wars of <a id="l1677"></a>the Turkish Empire upon the Romans, <a id="l1678"></a>&amp; begins with the solution of the four <a id="l1679"></a>Euphratean Sultanies A.C. 1258.</h2>
<p id="par128">The conditions of the sixt Trumpet are these.</p>
<p id="par129">1. The Euphratean horsmen are to be the next <a id="l1680"></a>great enemy after the Locusts which makes war upon <a id="l1681"></a>the Roman territories.</p>
<p id="par130">2. There is a great affinity between the Locusts &amp; <a id="l1682"></a> Euphratean horsmen. For the Locusts were repre<a id="l1683"></a>sented like horses prepared to battel with faces like <a id="l1684"></a>men &amp; breastplates, which is the shape of these hors<a id="l1685"></a>men. Also both have tailes of a serpentine form, <a id="l1686"></a>whereby I conceive their affinity in religion is insinu<a id="l1687"></a>ated. ffor a tail of that shape is an emblem of their <a id="l1688"></a>cognation to the old Serpent, as well as of their pug<a id="l1689"></a>nacious disposition.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p043r"> &lt;43r&gt; </span> 
<p id="par131">3. These horsmen were at first a quaternion of Kingdoms <a id="l1690"></a>for they are the army which was loosed to slay the third part <a id="l1691"></a>of men &amp; consequently the same with the 4 Angels  that is 4 great bodies politique. In the former Trum<a id="l1693"></a>pet an Angel was put to signify a king painted the King of the Locusts, &amp; thence <a id="l1694"></a>it is obvious to collect that the four Angells here may signify so <a id="l1695"></a>many kingdoms or nations,  For as a King in these prophesies is <a id="l1696"></a>used promiscuously to signify sometimes a single person &amp; <a id="l1697"></a>sometimes a Kingdom (as in Dan 7.17 &amp; 8.20 &amp; Apoc 17.10, 12,)  so may Angels be used since they are beleived to be no less superintendents over nations <a id="l1699"></a>then Kings.</p>
<p id="par132">**** 4. These nations were seated in a foursquare position. This is hinted by the 4 horns of the golden Altar from whence the voice concerning them came. ffor the horns by this their voice are made a type of the Angels &amp; consequently of their position. ffor they can typify them in nothing but their position &amp; number, &amp; it would be a superfluous circumstance were it only to express their number since that is otherwise sufficiently defined.</p>
<p id="par133">5. These  Nations were at first seated upon Euphrates, <a id="l1700"></a>as is manifest by the expression that the angels were bound in that <a id="l1701"></a>river.</p>
<p id="par134">6. This Trumpet begins at their loosing from that River.</p>
<p id="par135">7. The Army is described exceeding numerous. δύο μυριά<a id="l1702"></a>δες μυριάδων, or according to some readings μυριάδες μυ<a id="l1703"></a>ριάδων the word δύο being omitted. In either reading <a id="l1704"></a>we are to understand only an immense number (as in Psal <a id="l1705"></a>58.17, The chariots of God are two myriads) For the num<a id="l1706"></a>ber μυριὰς רבוא or רככה is of those numerall words which <a id="l1707"></a>the Hebrews use not only for ten thousand but indefinitely <a id="l1708"></a>for any great number, especially when it is doubled, as <a id="l1709"></a>may be seen in Dan 7.10.</p>
<p id="par136">8. Their armour is described after a very singular man<a id="l1710"></a>ner; viz: That they had breastplates of fire &amp; Iacynth &amp; <a id="l1711"></a>Brimstone, &amp; out of the mouths of the horses (whose heads were <a id="l1712"></a>as the heads of Lyons) issued fire &amp; smoke &amp; brimstone where<a id="l1713"></a>by they killed men.</p>
<p id="par137">9. By these three (the fire &amp; smoke &amp; brimstone) the <em class="underline">third</em> <a id="l1714"></a>part of men was killed.</p>
<p id="par138">10. The rest of men which were not killed by these plagues <a id="l1715"></a>repented not.</p>
<p id="par139">11. The time for which they were prepared  to destroy <a id="l1716"></a>the third part of men is an hower &amp; a day &amp; a month &amp; a year.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p044r"> &lt;44r&gt; </span> 
<p id="par140">These being the conditions of this Trumpet, they do after <a id="l1717"></a>a very singular manner point out the Turkish Empire. <a id="l1718"></a>ffor 1 The Turks were the next great enemy to the <a id="l1719"></a>Roman territories. Their's &amp; the Saracen's Empire have <a id="l1720"></a>been the two greatest &amp; the only two very great scour<a id="l1721"></a>ges of the Christian world for this last thousand years, &amp; <a id="l1722"></a>therefore none but these can be intended by the two first <a id="l1723"></a>of these three great woes, unles we will suppos that the <a id="l1724"></a>Holy Ghost has been very particular in describing some <a id="l1725"></a>smaller plagues of the Christians &amp; taken no notis of <a id="l1726"></a>the greatest, which would be to make the parts of the Prophe<a id="l1727"></a>sy hold no proportion with those of history.</p>
<p id="par141">The common period of these two Trumpets I assigne <a id="l1728"></a>to the year 1258. For I measure the whole duration of the <a id="l1729"></a>former Trumpet by the standing of the Chalifate &amp; not <a id="l1730"></a>by the twice five months raging of the Locusts, that being <a id="l1731"></a>but a more signal intermediate period. For after that <a id="l1732"></a>time the world continued in the hands of the Saracens <a id="l1733"></a>for many years, though not under the dominion of the <a id="l1734"></a>Chalifa but broken into many temporal kingdomes &amp; the Chalifa himself was always of the Saracen nation &amp; from before the foundation of Bagdad to the end of the Chalifate of one &amp; the same family of the Abasiom. And <a id="l1735"></a>therefore as this Trumpet began with the birth of the angel <a id="l1736"></a>of the bottomles pit (exprest by the falling of the star <a id="l1737"></a>from heaven) which was before his empire was founded, so it <a id="l1738"></a>should end with the deceasing of that angel though long after <a id="l1739"></a>his empire was rent in pieces. Now the deceasing of this An<a id="l1740"></a>gel was in the year 1258 when Hulacu the Tartar took <a id="l1741"></a>Bagdad &amp; put an end to the Chalifate; &amp; immediately after <a id="l1742"></a>this followed the loosing of the four angels as shall be ex<a id="l1743"></a>plained hereafter.</p>
<p id="par142">The Turks indeed long before this time erected <a id="l1744"></a>severall powerfull Sultanies among the Saracens, &amp; were <a id="l1745"></a>for some time Lords even over the Chalifa. But the last <a id="l1746"></a>hundred years the Chalifa shook of their yoke &amp; became <a id="l1747"></a>sole Lord of Bagdad with its territories Iraca &amp; a good part of  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p045r"> &lt;45r&gt; </span>  Persia; &amp; therefore now equalling or rather exceeding the <a id="l1748"></a>Turkish Sultanies in temporall greatness, &amp; as to spirituall <a id="l1749"></a>jurisdiction being universally acknowledged &amp; honoured as <a id="l1750"></a>well by the Turkish Sultans as by the Saracens, much after <a id="l1751"></a>the same manner that the Pope is acknowledged supreme among <a id="l1752"></a>Christian Princes; it will be more proper to  look upon <a id="l1753"></a>the Turkish Sultanies hitherto as grafted into the Sara<a id="l1754"></a>cen's Empire then as another Empire planted in its stead. <a id="l1755"></a>This at least we must do if we will follow the judgment <a id="l1756"></a>of the Eastern historians who are in this the most compe<a id="l1757"></a>tent &amp; unprejudic't judges. For Elmacinus, although <a id="l1758"></a>he distinguish the Saracen Empire into three parts or Dy<a id="l1759"></a>nasties, the first conteining its increase during the reign of the Abasides at Bagdad <a id="l1760"></a>untill they subjected themselves to temporall Princes (which two <a id="l1761"></a>Dynasties I interpreted to be the twice five months reign of the <a id="l1762"></a>Locusts,) &amp; the third its continuation after its distraction: yet at <a id="l1763"></a>the setting up of the Turkish Sultanies, whether by Togrulbec <a id="l1764"></a>or others, he makes no distinction but interweaves their histo<a id="l1765"></a>ry with the Saracen's in the third Dynasty. And Abul-Pha<a id="l1766"></a>rajius, who divides his history into so many dynasties as there <a id="l1767"></a>had been supreme Empires since the creation &amp; reccons the Empire of the Sa<a id="l1768"></a>racens in the 9<sup>th</sup> place, extends this from their Prophet Ma<a id="l1769"></a>homet to the taking of Bagdad by the Tartars &amp; there con<a id="l1770"></a>cludes it making the shortliv'd Empire of the Tattars then <a id="l1771"></a>founded upon the ruins of the Saracens &amp; Turks by Hulacu <a id="l1772"></a>to be the 10<sup>th</sup> Dynasty or supreme Empire &amp; the year 1258 <a id="l1773"></a>their common period.</p>
<p id="par143">By extending the fift Trumpet thus far downward its <a id="l1774"></a>length will be verey great in proportion to the former Trumpets. <a id="l1775"></a>But it was fit that the first Trumpets should be but short being <a id="l1776"></a>a description of that most criticall time wherein the true re<a id="l1777"></a>ligion was everted &amp; the Apostacy set up, &amp; therefore to  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p046r"> &lt;46r&gt; </span>  be delineated more articulately: &amp; the H. Ghost has signi<a id="l1778"></a>fied the far greater length of these last Trumpets by <a id="l1779"></a>dwelling much longer upon their description.</p>
<p id="par144">2. The affinity between the  Saracens &amp; Turks is <a id="l1780"></a>sufficiently conspicuous, the last having been interwoven <a id="l1781"></a>with the Empire of the former, (sometimes as subjects, <a id="l1782"></a>sometimes as  fellow Princes) for some hun<a id="l1783"></a>dreds of years together so as to be esteemed almost <a id="l1784"></a>one people: &amp; both being also of the same religion.</p>
<p id="par145">3, 4 &amp; 5 The originall of the Turkish Empire agrees <a id="l1785"></a>also to the prophesy that it should be from a quarternion of kingdoms <a id="l1786"></a>seated upon Euphrates in a square position. For such was the constitution of the Turks <a id="l1787"></a>between the time that they first grew powerfull &amp; the in<a id="l1788"></a>vasion of the Tartars as may be learned out of the histories of Abul-Phrajius, Elmacinus. William Tyrius &amp; Ayton Armenus. The first that notably promoted <a id="l1789"></a>their state was Togrulbec (called also Togra, Tangrolipix, <a id="l1790"></a>Dogrissa &amp; Sadoc,) who having conquered Chorasan &amp; Persia <a id="l1791"></a>added Bagdad to his Empire A.C. 1055 &amp; made that the <a id="l1792"></a>seat thereof. And his successor Olub'Arslan (called also Asan <a id="l1793"></a>Olbarsalan, Alpasalem, &amp; Aspasalem) who began his reign A.C. <a id="l1794"></a>1063, added also Mesopotamia; a good part of which he took <a id="l1795"></a>from the Greeks, captivating at the same time their Em<a id="l1796"></a>perour Diogenes Romanus. The third Sultan Malechsah <a id="l1797"></a>or Melecla who began his reign A.C. 1071, sent Aksis &amp; Sjarfuddaulas the governour of Mausela to <a id="l1798"></a>invade Syria &amp; Cutlumuses to invade the lesser Asia, the  first of <a id="l1799"></a>which took Damascus A.C. 1075  the second  added Aleppo to Mausela AC 1079 <sup class="note" id="n111-ref">[111]</sup> &amp; between them subdued  almost all Syria, <a id="l1800"></a>&amp; the other made no less progress in Asia, [taking Cæsaria A.<a id="l1801"></a>C 1079.] And now this Empire being arrived to its ἀκμὴ <a id="l1802"></a> after the death of Malechsah (which happened A.C. <a id="l1803"></a>1092) became rent in pieces by civil dissentions, the subordi<a id="l1804"></a>nate Sultans of the principal cities asserting to themselves ab<a id="l1805"></a>solute dominion over the territories which they formerly held by the <a id="l1806"></a>favour of Malechsah &amp; his predecessors; whence sprang the <a id="l1807"></a>following Dynasties.</p>
<p id="par146">1 The remainder of the Sultans of Bagdad, whose Sul-  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p047r"> &lt;47r&gt; </span> tans were Barchiaruc (or Belchiaroc,) Muhammed, Mahmud, <a id="l1808"></a>David, Masud, Melechsah, Muhammed, &amp; Solyman Shah in <a id="l1809"></a>whom the race of the Salghucides at Bagdad ended about the <a id="l1810"></a>yeare 1160 : &amp; from thence forward unto the <a id="l1811"></a>taking of Bagdad by the Tartars, the Chalifa reco<a id="l1812"></a>vered &amp; maintained the Supreme temporal power within this <a id="l1813"></a>Sultany, which had been intermitted for about 224 years.</p>
<p id="par147">The Sultany of Mausela or Mosul a city of Me<a id="l1814"></a>sopotamia seated upon Tigris about 6 or 7 days journey <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n112-ref">[112]</sup> west<a id="l1815"></a>ward from Bagdad, &amp;  one or two days journey from one <a id="l1816"></a>of the streames of Euphrates.

<p id="par155">Now of these five Sultanies if the first be omitted <a id="l1887"></a>becaus it ceased long before the loosing of the Angels, &amp; <a id="l1888"></a>was coincident with the Chalifate while it lasted; there <a id="l1889"></a>will remain only four,  as the number of the <a id="l1890"></a>Angels requires. These four, &amp; only these are fellows in all <a id="l1891"></a>respects: ffor they were all of the same people, &amp; sprang <a id="l1892"></a>out of the same great Empire &amp; took their beginning much <a id="l1893"></a>about the same time, &amp; lasted together for almost two hundred <a id="l1894"></a>years, though not without variety of fortune, till at length <a id="l1895"></a>they were ruined by the Tartars: &amp; therefore being also <a id="l1896"></a>situate upon the branches of Euphrates on all sides so as to comprehend that river,  <a id="l1897"></a>&amp; that in a square position, they fully answer to the type of the 4 angels bound   therein.</p>
<p id="par156">***<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 48v &gt; </span>*** Their position was not indeed exactly square.

Suppposing therefore that these Tetrarchies are the 4 <a id="l1906"></a>Angels &amp; that by their being bound in Euphrates is meant <a id="l1907"></a>their residence upon that river, the loosing of them,  since it stands in opposition to binding, must be in<a id="l1909"></a>terpreted their loosing from those seats. And this happen<a id="l1910"></a>ed at the invasion of the Tartars, the history of which <a id="l1911"></a>is as follows.</p>
<p id="par158">In the year 1203 the supreme Empire of the Tartars (a <a id="l1912"></a>name not heard of before this time) was founded by <a id="l1913"></a>Iingiz Chan, by whom amongst other eastern &amp; nor<a id="l1914"></a>thern regions Chorasan was subdued &amp; by his successors <a id="l1915"></a>the Kingdom of Armenia much afflicted &amp; the Sulta<a id="l1916"></a>ny of Iconium also (A.C. 1243,) but not ruined. At <a id="l1917"></a>length Mangaca Chan the 4<sup>th</sup> Emperor of the Tatars <a id="l1918"></a>being converted to Christianity by means of Ayton <a id="l1919"></a>king of Armenia, sent his brother Hulacu (or Halaon) <a id="l1920"></a>with a great army to invade the Turks &amp; root out <a id="l1921"></a>their religion. Hulacu therefore advancing from <a id="l1922"></a>the east, after he had stayed some time in Persia  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p050r"> &lt;50r&gt; </span>  &amp; subjected it, came to Bagdad Ian 22 1258, &amp; in a day <a id="l1923"></a>&amp; a night compassed the city with a wall &amp; a ditch, &amp; took <a id="l1924"></a>it the 10<sup>th</sup> of February following;  his soldiers continuing <a id="l1925"></a>to spoile kill &amp; make captives for seven days together, <a id="l1926"></a>at the end of which time the Chalifa was also  put to death <a id="l1927"></a>&amp; so the Chalifate dissolved.</p>
<p id="par159">After this Hulacu the same year  upon some provocation <a id="l1928"></a>sends his son Yashmut with part of his army to beseige Mi<a id="l1929"></a>epharekin, who in a day &amp; a night compas it with a wall &amp; <a id="l1930"></a>a deep ditch &amp; begin to assault it, but after some sharp <a id="l1931"></a>conflicts finding they could not take it by force, they deter<a id="l1932"></a>mined to keep it shut up till it should be worn out by <a id="l1933"></a>famin.</p>
<p id="par160">The next year A.C 1259 Hulacu cites the Sultans of Syria <a id="l1934"></a>&amp; Asia to come to him &amp; submit themselves, which <em class="underline">Ezzoddin</em> <a id="l1935"></a>the Sultan of Asia with his brother <em class="underline">Rucnoddin</em> did, but <a id="l1936"></a><em class="underline">Naser</em> the Sultan of Syria refused. Wherefore he sent <a id="l1937"></a>back the Asian Sultans honourably &amp;  con<a id="l1938"></a>firmed them in their dominions, but invaded Syria <a id="l1939"></a>A.C. 1260 with an army of four hundred thousand, <a id="l1940"></a>taking first  <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n114-ref">[114]</sup> Harran  &amp; b<sup class="note" id="n115-ref">[115]</sup> Roan () with the adjacent <a id="l1941"></a>regions on the east of Euphrates which belonged to the  Syrian Sultany, &amp; then having passed the river, whilst his <a id="l1943"></a>Captains invaded the other cities of this Sultany, (amongst <a id="l1944"></a>which was , Emessia, Hama, Moarra &amp;c) he him<a id="l1945"></a>self besieged Aleppo &amp; took it in a few days, a greater <a id="l1946"></a>number of people being slain there then at Bagdad. <a id="l1947"></a> In the mean while Naser, who with his court resided at Damascus, hearing of the progress of the Tatars fled with his family into the Desert Carac &amp; Shaubac, &amp; the Nobles of Damascus so soon as the Tatars approached the City delivered it to them. </p>
<p id="par161">Not long after Hulacu being about to return <a id="l1949"></a>into the eastern regions, the other army came to him <a id="l1950"></a>from the siege of Miepharekin, bringing with them <a id="l1951"></a>Ashraph the Sultan thereof, &amp; relating how they had slain <a id="l1952"></a>all that were in the city, there being but few of them whom <a id="l1953"></a>the famin had not destroyed before, because otherwise the army of Tatars would not have  sufficed to take the citty</p>
<p id="par162">About the same time Hulacu, so soon as he came  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p051r"> &lt;51r&gt; </span> neare Maredin cited the Sultan thereof to appeare before <a id="l1954"></a>him, but he refusing, the Tatars beseige that city also, <a id="l1955"></a>But the Sultan dying suddenly, his son Modhaffer present<a id="l1956"></a>ly yeilds the city to Hulacu; whereupon Hulacu treated <a id="l1957"></a>him honourably &amp; restored the city to him with the rest <a id="l1958"></a>of his fathers dominions. Yet about 30 years after <a id="l1959"></a>this Sultany as well as the rest was dissolved.</p>
<p id="par163">Whilst Hulacu besieged Maredin, Naser with his family was taken &amp; slain. And the next year A.C 1261 Saleh the sultan of <a id="l1960"></a>Mausela with his brother combining with the Egyptians <a id="l1961"></a>against the Tattars, was invaded also by them under <a id="l1962"></a>the leading of Samdago one of Hulacu's captains, <a id="l1963"></a>&amp;  Mausela beseiged &amp; taken, the soldiers continu<a id="l1964"></a>ing for eight days together to spoile kill &amp; capt<a id="l1965"></a>vate. And amongst the rest Saleh was taken &amp; com<a id="l1966"></a>manded to be slain by Hulacu.</p>
<p id="par164"><sup class="note" id="n116-ref">[116]</sup>Vntill this time the Greeks had constantly possessed <a id="l1967"></a>Asia strictly so called, Paphlagonia, Bythinia, Phrygia magna, <a id="l1968"></a>Phrygia Pacatiana, Caria &amp; part of Cilicia. And the rest of <a id="l1969"></a>the Asian Provinces to Euphrates, namely Lycaonia, Galatia, <a id="l1970"></a>Pamphilia, Armenia, Hellenopontus, Pisidia, &amp; Lycia be<a id="l1971"></a>longed to the Sultany of Iconium. But now the Turks <a id="l1972"></a>of Mesopotamia &amp; Syria being molested by the Tatars <a id="l1973"></a>flocked into Asia to shelter themselves under the Iconian <a id="l1974"></a>Sultan, &amp; to obtein new seats their severall Princes <a id="l1975"></a>made wars upon the Grecians. Mantachia subdued the city <a id="l1976"></a>Ephesus &amp; the Province Caria, Atin conquered Lydia as far <a id="l1977"></a>as Smyrna.

Carasses the other Phrygia between Hellespont &amp; the <a id="l1980"></a>city Asso, &amp; Othman all Bythinia with part of Paphlago<a id="l1981"></a>nia.</p>
<p id="par165">In the mean time the Iconian Sultany became much <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p052r"> &lt;52r&gt; </span> afflicted &amp; weakned by the Tatars pressing upon them &amp; <a id="l1982"></a>taking from them the regions next Euphrates insomuch that <a id="l1983"></a>at the death of Aladin it was  dissolved. And then <a id="l1984"></a>or soon after, namely in the year 1299, Othoman being <a id="l1985"></a>grown more powerfull then the rest of the Turkish Princes <a id="l1986"></a>took upon him the dignity &amp; title of Sultan &amp;  under him the whole body of the <a id="l1989"></a>Turks united by degrees: whereby being rendred more powr<a id="l1990"></a>full they prevailed still more upon the Greeks, &amp; within a <a id="l1991"></a>while invaded Europe, not ceasing to propagate their <a id="l1992"></a>victories till at length they overthrew the Constantinopo<a id="l1993"></a>litan Empire &amp; on its ruins <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">erected</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp; <span class="sub">founded</span></span> that great Empire <a id="l1994"></a>which we see at present.</p>
<p id="par166">Now in this history we have first the desolation of  <a id="l1995"></a>Bagdad. But this being not a Turkish Sultany like the rest, <a id="l1996"></a>but in the hands of the Chalifa who had been always of the <a id="l1997"></a>Saracen Nation &amp; from before the foundation of Bagdad of one &amp; <a id="l1998"></a>the same family of the Abasides; it will be most proper to <a id="l1999"></a>refer the desolation of this city to the former Trumpet as the <a id="l2000"></a>conclusion thereof, &amp; so there will remain these four Turk<a id="l2001"></a>ish Nations, the south-Mesopotamian, the north-Mesopotami<a id="l2002"></a>an including part of Armenia, the Syrian, &amp; the Asian <a id="l2003"></a>which at this time were the full extent of the Turkish domi<a id="l2004"></a>nions, &amp; all which within the compass of 30 or 40 years after <a id="l2005"></a>the dissolution of the Chalifate, that is  in the beginning of <a id="l2006"></a>this Trumpet were overrun &amp; loosed by the Tatars from <a id="l2007"></a>their Eufratean seats, &amp; forced upon the Christians to <a id="l2008"></a>make war upon them &amp; erect that great Empire which <a id="l2009"></a>reigns at present &amp; is the plague of apostate Christendom <a id="l2010"></a>threatned in this Trumpet.</p>
<p id="par167">The greatest objection against this interpretation is <a id="l2011"></a>that Miepharekin was at this time a distinct Sultany &amp;  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p053r"> &lt;53r&gt; </span> so there should have been rather 5 then 4 Angels. But if we <a id="l2012"></a>consider that this Sultany was neither of equall standing nor  probably <a id="l2013"></a>of equall extent with the rest, it being but lately rent from the <a id="l2014"></a>Sultany of Maredin &amp; guirded on the one hand by the kingdom <a id="l2015"></a>of Armenia &amp; on the other by the Sultany of Maredin, whose seats <a id="l2016"></a>Maredin &amp; Miepharekin were not above 80 or 90 Italian miles <a id="l2017"></a>distant; &amp; also that Miepharekin was seated beyond Tigris, &amp; <a id="l2018"></a>so  could not be so properly said to be bound in Euphrates <a id="l2019"></a>as the rest: it will be more naturall to refer this (as I signi<a id="l2020"></a>fied above) to the Sultany of Maredin as a branch thereof, rec<a id="l2021"></a>coning them still to make but one great Nation or Angel <a id="l2022"></a>as formerly, then to fellow it with the originall Sultanies. <a id="l2023"></a>A case not unlike this we have in the third of Daniel's <a id="l2024"></a>universal Empires represented by the Leopard, who had 4 heads to signify its division into 4 Kingdoms at the death of A<a id="l2025"></a>lexander. And yet it was divided into more then four King<a id="l2026"></a>doms. ffor besides the Egyptian, Syrian, Asian, &amp; Macedo<a id="l2027"></a>nian, there was (to mention no others) the Thracian which con<a id="l2028"></a>tinued distinct about 36 years, &amp; yet, becaus none of the <a id="l2029"></a>principall kingdoms, such as might properly be represented <a id="l2030"></a>by heads of a Beast, it was not recconed among the other <a id="l2031"></a>four but rather referred to the Kingdom of Macedon <a id="l2032"></a>as I suppose becaus it was at length united to that. <a id="l2033"></a>Compare this with the present case of the Turks, &amp; I think <a id="l2034"></a>it will make the interpretation clear.</p>
<p id="par168">Analogous to the loosing of these Angels is the drying up of the <a id="l2035"></a>waters of Euphrates in the 6<sup>t</sup> Vial. For these two actions must corre<a id="l2036"></a>spond with one another becaus they are the beginnings of this Trum<a id="l2037"></a>pet &amp; Vial which are contemporary. Now by the waters of this <a id="l2038"></a>river we are to understand the people situate upon it by <a id="l2039"></a>Def <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> that is, the Turkish Sultanies. And by the pouring  a Vial upon this river the inflicting of some great calamity upon the people such as was the tartarian invasion. And by the continued drying up <a id="l2040"></a>the waters of that river, the wasting of the power &amp; dominion of that people <a id="l2041"></a>by Def <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> that is, the dissolution of the Turkish Sultanies by that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p054r"> &lt;54r&gt; </span> invasion. And consequently by the Kings or <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n117-ref">[117]</sup> Princes from the east whose <a id="l2042"></a>way was prepared by the drying up these waters, we must under<a id="l2043"></a>stand the chief leaders of the great army of horsmen which upon the <a id="l2044"></a>loosing of the 4 Angels came from Euphrates to execute the plague <a id="l2045"></a>of this Trumpet, that is the Princes under whose conduct <a id="l2046"></a>the Turks fled from the Tattars into Asia to invade the Christians <a id="l2047"></a>For these were the Princes or Kings  from the East whose way was <a id="l2048"></a>prepared by the dissolution of the Euphratean Sultanies. And of <a id="l2049"></a>these there are recconed by historians seven eminent ones a little be<a id="l2050"></a>fore they united under Othoman besides others of inferior note which first united under those. Thus much concerning the o<a id="l2051"></a>riginal of this great empire. Proceed we now to the rest of the circumstances.</p>
<p id="par169">7. And the next is the numerousness of the Turkish armies. But how <a id="l2052"></a>great this hath been since their loosing &amp; still is, is better known then <a id="l2053"></a>that I need stay to compute it. I shall rather observe that since these horsmen <a id="l2054"></a>as well as the Locusts were to be so exceeding numerous, we may thence <a id="l2055"></a>collect that they were to be the armies of two very great Empires, <a id="l2056"></a>&amp; consequently of none other then the Saracenical &amp; Turkish, the <a id="l2057"></a>only two great ones by which the Christian world has been hitherto <a id="l2058"></a>afflicted.</p>
<p id="par170">In both these armies there is mention made only of horsmen <a id="l2059"></a>but we are not to conclude thence that the armies should consist <a id="l2060"></a>of horsmen only, but rather that the description is taken from <a id="l2061"></a>the nobler part &amp; that part wherein they should notably ex<a id="l2062"></a>cell. Yea the foot are included in the hors being represented by their <a id="l2063"></a>tailes. For the tail of a hors according to ancient Interpreters<sup class="note" id="n118-ref">[118]</sup> <a id="l2064"></a>signifies the train of his rider, &amp; the train of an Army is the foot. <a id="l2065"></a>Hence it is that in this Trumpet the tailes are said to have <a id="l2066"></a>heads &amp; to do hurt, that is to fight as well as the riders of the <a id="l2067"></a>horses: which is a plain insinuation that they signify men as well as <a id="l2068"></a>the riders.</p>
<p id="par171">8. The description of the armour of these horsmen (that they <a id="l2069"></a>had breastplates of fire &amp; jacinth &amp; brimstone &amp;c) is very singular, <a id="l2070"></a>there being no where els in the whole scriptures such a description <a id="l2071"></a>of armour to be met with. What therefore can be here <a id="l2072"></a>intended but the new way of fighting not known <a id="l2073"></a>in the world before the beginning of this </p><span class="pagenumber" id="p055r"> &lt;55r&gt; </span>

<p id="par173">4. These Kingdoms were at first seated upon Eu<a id="l2075"></a>phrates, as is manifest by the expression that the angels <a id="l2076"></a>were bound in that river.</p>

The Army is described exceeding numerous. <a id="l2078"></a>δυο μυριάδες μυριάδων, or according to some read<a id="l2079"></a>ings μυριάδες μυριάδων, the word δυο being omitted. <a id="l2080"></a>In either reading we are to understand only an <a id="l2081"></a>immens number,  (as in Psal 58.17 The chari<a id="l2082"></a>ots of God are  two myriads.) For the number <a id="l2083"></a>μυριὰς רבוא or רככה is of those  numerall words <a id="l2084"></a>which the Hebrews use not only for ten thousand but in<a id="l2085"></a>definitely for any great number, especially when it is <a id="l2086"></a>thus doubled, as may be seen in Dan 7.10.</p>
<p id="par176">7. Their armour is described after a very <a id="l2087"></a>singular manner; viz: That they had breastplates of <a id="l2088"></a>fire &amp; of Iacinth &amp;  Brimstone, &amp; the heads <a id="l2089"></a>of the horses were as the heads of Lyons, &amp; out of <a id="l2090"></a>their mouths issued fire &amp; smoke &amp; brimstone <a id="l2091"></a>whereby they killed men.</p>
<p id="par177">8. By these three (the fire &amp; smoke &amp; brimstone) <a id="l2092"></a>the <em class="underline">third</em> part of men was killed.</p>
<p id="par178">9. The rest of men which were not killed by <a id="l2093"></a>these plagues repented not.</p>
<p id="par179">10 The time for which they were prepared to de<a id="l2094"></a>stroy the third part of men is an hour, &amp; a day &amp; a month </p><span class="pagenumber" id="p056r"> &lt;56r&gt; </span> 
<p id="par180">These being the conditions of this Trumpet, they do <a id="l2095"></a>after a very singular manner point out the Turkish <a id="l2096"></a>Empire. For j The Turks were the next great <a id="l2097"></a>enemy to the Roman territories. Their's &amp; the Saracen's <a id="l2098"></a>Empire have been the two greatest, &amp; the only two <a id="l2099"></a>very great scourges of the Christian world for <a id="l2100"></a>this last thousand years, &amp; therefore none but <a id="l2101"></a>these can be intended by the two first of the three <a id="l2102"></a>great woes; unles we will suppose that the Holy Ghost <a id="l2103"></a>has been very elaborate in describing some smaller <a id="l2104"></a>plagues of the Christians &amp; taken no notis of the greatest; <a id="l2105"></a>which would be to make the parts of the Prophesy <a id="l2106"></a>hold no proportion with those of history.</p>
<p id="par181">The common period of these two Trumpets I <a id="l2107"></a>assigne to the yeare 1258. For I measure the <a id="l2108"></a>whole duration of the former Trumpet by the <a id="l2109"></a>standing of the Chalifate &amp; not by the twice five <a id="l2110"></a>months raging of the Locusts, that being but a <a id="l2111"></a>more signall intermediate period. For after <a id="l2112"></a>that time the world continued in the hands of the Sa<a id="l2113"></a>racens for many years though not under the <a id="l2114"></a>dominion of the Chalifa but broken into may tem<a id="l2115"></a>porall kingdoms. And therefore as this Trumpet <a id="l2116"></a>began with the birth of the Angel of the bottomless <a id="l2117"></a>pit ( exprest by the falling of the star from <a id="l2118"></a>heaven) which was before his Empire was founded, <a id="l2119"></a>so it should end with the deceasing of that angel <a id="l2120"></a>though long after the abrogating of his Empire. <a id="l2121"></a>Now the deceasing of this Angel was in the year <a id="l2122"></a>1258 when Haalon the Tartar took Bagdad &amp; <a id="l2123"></a>put an end to the Chalifate. And at that very <a id="l2124"></a>time the 4 Angels were loosed as shall be explained <a id="l2125"></a>hereafter</p><span class="pagenumber" id="p057r"> &lt;57r&gt; </span> 
<p id="par182">The length of the fift Trumpet is indeed thus <a id="l2126"></a>assigned very great in proportion to the former <a id="l2127"></a>Trumpets. But it was fit that the first Trumpets <a id="l2128"></a>should be but short, being a description of that most criticall <a id="l2129"></a>time wherein the true religion was everted &amp; the <a id="l2130"></a>Apostacy set up, &amp; therefore to be delineated <a id="l2131"></a>more articulately: &amp; the holy Ghost has signi<a id="l2132"></a>fied the far greater length of these last Trumpets <a id="l2133"></a>by dwelling much longer upon their description.</p>
<p id="par183">2. The affinity between the Turks &amp; Sara<a id="l2134"></a>cens is sufficiently conspicuous, the last having been interwoven with the Empire of the former living within it <a id="l2135"></a> sometimes as subjects, sometimes as neighbouring Princes  <a id="l2136"></a>for some hundreds of years together, so as to be esteemed <a id="l2137"></a>almost one people; ; &amp; both being also <a id="l2139"></a>of the same religion.</p>
<p id="par184">3, &amp; 4. The original of the Turkish Empire <a id="l2140"></a>agrees also to the prophesy that it should be from <a id="l2141"></a>a quaternion of kingdoms seated upon Euphrates. <a id="l2142"></a>For such was the constitution of the Turks when <a id="l2143"></a>they began first to have the face of an Empire; <a id="l2144"></a>they then consisting of these four Kingdoms or <a id="l2145"></a>Sultanies, the Persian, Damasacene, Alepian, &amp;  Iconian.  The first of these was founded by To<a id="l2146"></a>grulbec (or Tangrolipix) who first subdued Cho<a id="l2147"></a>rasan &amp; Persia, &amp; then advanced to Bagdad &amp; <a id="l2148"></a>made himself master thereof in the year 1055 <a id="l2149"></a>fixing the seat of his empire there &amp; in the year <a id="l2150"></a>1057 being inaugurated Emperor of Emperors by <a id="l2151"></a>the Chalifa.  Out of this Sultany sprang the <a id="l2152"></a>other three whereof that at Damascus was founded <a id="l2153"></a>by Tagjuddaulus Nisus, (the Nephew of Togrulbec) who  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p058r"> &lt;58r&gt; </span>  took Damascus from the Saracens in the year 1079. His successor was <a id="l2154"></a>Ducathes (or Decacus) A.C. 1095, to whom, saith <a id="l2155"></a>Scilix,<sup class="note" id="n119-ref">[119]</sup> all the region of Decapolis was subject, <a id="l2156"></a>which region bordered upon Euphrates</p>
<p id="par185">The Alepian Sultany was founded by  Sjarfud<a id="l2157"></a>daulas in the same year 1079: whose metropolis A<a id="l2158"></a>lepo was watered by an arm of Euphrates drawn <a id="l2159"></a>thither by one of the Sultans.</p>
<p id="par186">The fourth Sultany whose Metropolis at first <a id="l2160"></a>was Cæsara (not Cæsarea of Cappadocia but a town <a id="l2161"></a> upon the river  Orontes in Syria called Sjazarum by <a id="l2162"></a>Elmacinus &amp; corruptly Cæsarea for Cæsara by the <a id="l2163"></a>Europeans as William Tyrius writes<sup class="note" id="n120-ref">[120]</sup> ) was founded by Sedij<a id="l2164"></a>duddaulas (a Kinsman of the afforesaid Togrulbec,) who <a id="l2165"></a>took Cæsara from the Romans the next year 1080, <a id="l2166"></a>&amp; he dying within two years , his successors Bel<a id="l2167"></a>feve &amp; Soliman inlarged the kingdom  into Asia beyond Nicæa of Bythinia, although not <a id="l2169"></a>long after they were beaten back again to Euphra<a id="l2170"></a>tes by the champions of the Ierusalemitan war. The <a id="l2171"></a>sultans of this Tetrarchy though at first they made Cæsara <a id="l2172"></a>the seat of their kingdom yet afterward they resided <a id="l2173"></a>most at Iconium in Cappadocia, whence they were  called Sultans of Iconium.</p>
<p id="par187">In this fourfold form the Turks  conti<a id="l2175"></a>nued for  almost two hundred years though not without some mutations. <a id="l2176"></a>For the Iconian Sultany  towards the <a id="l2177"></a>latter end was sometimes for a while divided into two or <a id="l2178"></a>more dynasties by the posterity of the deceased Sultan, &amp; <a id="l2179"></a>the Damascene &amp; Alepian Sultanies were for some time <a id="l2180"></a>united under Noradin &amp; again under Saladin, but after <a id="l2181"></a>their deaths  returned <a id="l2182"></a>to their ancient state, excepting that about the year <a id="l2183"></a>1247 the Damascene Sultany fell into the hands of the <a id="l2184"></a>Egyptian Sultan (who from the year 1168 had ben of the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p059r"> &lt;59r&gt; </span> race of the Turks springing out of the Damascene Sul<a id="l2185"></a>tany:) &amp;  about 6 or 7 years after it was take from the Egyptians by the Sultan of Alepo.. But however it <a id="l2187"></a>is enough if during these little intervalls it continued <a id="l2188"></a>a distinct Province with its own Metropolis &amp; people.</p>
<p id="par188">For the better understanding this busines I have <a id="l2189"></a>here given you a table of these Sultans with the beginnings <a id="l2190"></a>of their reign so far as I have met with them in the his<a id="l2191"></a>tories of Elmacinus, W.

<p id="par189">Besides these four, W. Tyrius<sup class="note" id="n121-ref">[121]</sup> mentions a fift at Antioch given <a id="l2193"></a>to Accian by Belfesc, adding that it was but of narrow bounds, <a id="l2194"></a>the Chalifa of Egypt  (who was of the Saracen nation) <a id="l2195"></a>possessing all the regions unto Laodicea of Syria. But this <a id="l2196"></a>lasted not above 14 years, Antioch being taken A.C. 1098 <a id="l2197"></a>by the Christians under Boamudas: &amp; therefore since it was so <a id="l2198"></a>inconsiderable &amp;  was utterly extinct so long before the loosing of the <a id="l2199"></a>angels, there is no reason it should be recconed among those <a id="l2200"></a>that were loosed.</p>
<p id="par190">5 Now the loosing of the Angels I suppose to be the re- <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p060r"> &lt;60r&gt; </span>  laxation of the afforesaid Tetrarchies from their Eu<a id="l2201"></a>phratean seats by the invasions of the Tartars. For <a id="l2202"></a>when these Tetrarchies were first founded they be<a id="l2203"></a>gan to gain grownd very much from the Romans <a id="l2204"></a>but were suddenly checked by the famous Ierusa<a id="l2205"></a>lemitan expedition, &amp; as it were confined or bound <a id="l2206"></a>to Euphrates untill by the Tartars they were driven <a id="l2207"></a>from thence upon the Romans. And therefore this must <a id="l2208"></a>be their loosing supposing their precedent residence <a id="l2209"></a>upon that river to be their binding therein.</p>
<p id="par191">As for the time of this loosing it began to be at<a id="l2210"></a>tempted about the year 1200 when the Tartars <a id="l2211"></a>first with an innumerable army led by Changius <a id="l2212"></a>Chan brake in upon the Turks, but was not per<a id="l2213"></a>formed till 1258 when Haleon the Tartar overran <a id="l2214"></a>Persia, took Bagdad &amp; dissolved that Sultany  <a id="l2215"></a>together with the Chalifate, &amp;  then crossing Mesopotamia took Alepo <a id="l2216"></a>&amp; Damascus A.C. 1260 &amp; soon after Ieonium also, dis<a id="l2217"></a>solving the two first of those sultanies, &amp; taking the <a id="l2218"></a>third from Iathatines &amp;  dividing it between Masut <a id="l2219"></a>&amp; Keicubades whom he made tributaries, &amp; then in the <a id="l2220"></a>sixt year of his expedition A.C 1262 returning home to succeed <a id="l2221"></a>his  deceased brother. Thus were the Turks  of <a id="l2222"></a>these four Sultanies all at once as it were at a <a id="l2223"></a>watch word given loosed from Euphrates &amp; driven into <a id="l2224"></a> Natolia to make war upon the Romans; the re<a id="l2225"></a>liques of them also which after this remained beyond Euphra<a id="l2226"></a>tes in broken Dynasties being in the year 1289 uni<a id="l2227"></a>versally ejected out of Persia into the Roman territories: <a id="l2228"></a>which they continually gained upon as they lost grownd to the <a id="l2229"></a>Tartars. For although they were now divided into many <a id="l2230"></a>Satrapies, yet by degrees they overran &amp; possest themselves of almost all  Natolia.  Nor stopt they there but after a while  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p061r"> &lt;61r&gt; </span> uniting under Ottoman began to rage more fiercely, in<a id="l2231"></a>vaded Europe &amp; propogated their victories over the Christians <a id="l2232"></a>till they overthrew the Constantinopolitan Empire &amp; upon its <a id="l2233"></a>ruins erected that great Empire which reigns at present, <a id="l2234"></a>&amp; is the main subject of this Trumpet.</p>
<p id="par192">In the sixt Vial this loosing is exprest as if the <a id="l2235"></a>Kings were to come from beyond Euphrates. But I <a id="l2236"></a>suppose relation is there had only to the Persian Sulta<a id="l2237"></a>ny; that being by many degrees greater &amp; more con<a id="l2238"></a>siderable then all the rest put together, &amp; at the loosing <a id="l2239"></a>dissipated into many Satrapies. For it was the custom <a id="l2240"></a>of the Turks to sort themselves in great bodies according <a id="l2241"></a>to their severall families, the heads of which families <a id="l2242"></a>were upon occasion given ready to assert their liberty. Whence <a id="l2243"></a>by the incursion of the Tartars (which as I said began first <a id="l2244"></a>about the year 1200) the Persian Sultany being so very <a id="l2245"></a>large must necessarily have been broken by degrees into  many new Sultanies (as they called all free <a id="l2246"></a>Satrapies) some of which (though not recconned among the <a id="l2247"></a>angels bound in Euphrates becaus none of the original <a id="l2248"></a>Sultanies but comprehended in that of Bagdad, nor seated <a id="l2249"></a>upon Euphrates<sup class="note" id="n122-ref">[122]</sup> but lying beyond  Mesopotamia a good part of which was in the hands of the King of Armenia who being a christian was an enemy <a id="l2251"></a>to the Turks combining with the Tartars against them) <a id="l2252"></a>yet might they probably be no whit inferior in ex<a id="l2253"></a>tent of dominion to the Sultanies on this side the river, <a id="l2254"></a>seing it was 30 years after the fall of the Sultany <a id="l2255"></a>of Bagdad before the Tartars could conquer &amp; expell <a id="l2256"></a>them all. From these chiefly I conceive sprang that <a id="l2257"></a>great number of Satrapies in Natolia, whereof there <a id="l2258"></a>are recconned seven principall ones a little before <a id="l2259"></a>Ottoman. And these therefore I suppose to be the Kings <a id="l2260"></a>of the east for the preparing of whose way the waters <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p062r"> &lt;62r&gt; </span>  of Euphrates were dried up; that is figuratively. For <a id="l2261"></a>I conceive nothing more is intended by that expression <a id="l2262"></a>but to signify that those kings should come from beyond <a id="l2263"></a>that river &amp; pass over it, &amp; consequently come out <a id="l2264"></a>of Persia. Thus much concerning the originall of this <a id="l2265"></a>great Empire. Proceed we now to the rest of the circum<a id="l2266"></a>stances.</p>
<p id="par193">6. How numerous the Turkish armies have been since <a id="l2267"></a>their loosing is better known then that I need stay to com<a id="l2268"></a>pute it. I shall rather observe that since these Euphratean <a id="l2269"></a>horsmen as well as the Locusts were to be so exceeding numer<a id="l2270"></a>ous we may thence collect that these were to be the armies <a id="l2271"></a>of two very great Empires, &amp; consequently of none other <a id="l2272"></a>then the Saracenicall &amp; Turkish Empires, the only two <a id="l2273"></a>great ones by which the christian world has been hitherto <a id="l2274"></a>afflicted.</p>
<p id="par194">In both these armies there is mention made only of hors<a id="l2275"></a>men, but we are not to conclude thence that the armies should <a id="l2276"></a>consist of horsmen only, but rather that the description is <a id="l2277"></a>taken from the nobler part &amp; that part wherein they should <a id="l2278"></a>notably excell. Yea the foot are included in the hors, being <a id="l2279"></a>represented by their tailes. For the tail of a hors accord<a id="l2280"></a>ing to ancient interpreters signifes the train of his rider <a id="l2281"></a>&amp; the train of an army is the foot. Hence it is that in <a id="l2282"></a>this  Trumpet the tailes are said to have heads &amp; to do hurt, <a id="l2283"></a>that is to fight as well as the riders of the horses: which is <a id="l2284"></a>a plain insinuation that they signify men as well as the riders.</p>
<p id="par195">7. The description of the armour of these horsmen <a id="l2285"></a>(that they had breastplates of fire &amp; jacinth &amp; brimstone &amp;c) <a id="l2286"></a>is very singular, there being no where els in the whole <a id="l2287"></a>scripture such a description of armour to be met with. What <a id="l2288"></a>therefore can be here intended but the new way of fight<a id="l2289"></a>ing not known in the world before the beginning of this  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p063r"> &lt;63r&gt; </span> Trumpet? I mean with gunns which send forth fire &amp; <a id="l2290"></a>jacinthine smoke &amp; brimstone, whereby the medium being <a id="l2291"></a>corrupted a soldier to his enemy appears covered with fire <a id="l2292"></a>&amp; thick smoke whose colour is jacinthine &amp; substance <a id="l2293"></a>sulphureous; &amp; the heads of the horses are also made to seem <a id="l2294"></a>more fierce &amp; terrible as it were of Lions. For that <a id="l2295"></a>this is to be understood not of the reall armour of the hors<a id="l2296"></a>men &amp; shape of the hors heads, but of their appearance <a id="l2297"></a>by means of the corrupted medium, is manifest from hence <a id="l2298"></a>that the fire &amp; smoke &amp; brimstone is said to come out of the <a id="l2299"></a>horses mouths &amp; consequently must corrupt the medium. <a id="l2300"></a>Hence in the beginning of this description Saint Iohn saith: <a id="l2301"></a>Thus I saw the horses ἐν ὁράσει, in appearance; which is <a id="l2302"></a>as much as to say: This is the description of their appear<a id="l2303"></a>ance to the enemy, that they should seem covered as it were <a id="l2304"></a>with breastplates of fire &amp; smoke &amp; brimstone, &amp; that the <a id="l2305"></a>horses heads should appear like Lyons, &amp; the fire &amp; <a id="l2306"></a>smoke &amp; brimstone be sent forth after such a manner <a id="l2307"></a>that one would think it came  out of the horses mouths. <a id="l2308"></a>For this is the force of ἐν ὁράσει as may appear out of <a id="l2309"></a>Ch 4.3 Ὅμοιος ὁράσει λίθω Ιάσπιδι καὶ ἰρις ὁμοία <a id="l2310"></a>ὁράσει σμαραγδίνω: the only place besides in the Apocalyps <a id="l2311"></a>where this word is used.</p>
<p id="par196">Now that all this is a description of a fighting engin <a id="l2312"></a>is manifest from hence that the third part of men should <a id="l2313"></a>be killed by this fire &amp; smoke &amp; brimstone which ἐν <a id="l2314"></a>ὁράσει came out of the horses mouths. But if you ex<a id="l2315"></a>amin all sorts of engins that ever were in use before <a id="l2316"></a>guns you will not find any to whom this description <a id="l2317"></a>has any similitude: &amp; therefore none other then guns <a id="l2318"></a>can be intended by it.</p>
<p id="par197">9. And these were the engins (as is well known) by <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p064r"> &lt;64r&gt; </span> which the Turks killed the third part of men, that is overthrew <a id="l2319"></a>the Constantinopolitan Empire which in the beginning of this <a id="l2320"></a>Trumpet was about the third part of all the Christian <a id="l2321"></a>Kingdoms which sprang out of the old Roman Empire. <a id="l2322"></a>For the Constantinopolitan Empire, which I told you was <a id="l2323"></a>at first two parts in three of the whole, was  now <a id="l2324"></a>diminished by about three quarters of it: having lost <a id="l2325"></a>all that half which lay eastward of Natolia, the Medi<a id="l2326"></a>terranean sea &amp; Egypt, &amp; also about one half of the <a id="l2327"></a>remainder, namely Egypt,  Mœsia, &amp; part <a id="l2328"></a>of Natolia.</p>
<p id="par198">10. Yet notwithstanding this judgment upon the third part <a id="l2329"></a>of men the other two third parts which were not killed <a id="l2330"></a>by these plagues, namely the rest of the European Kingdoms <a id="l2331"></a>which descended from the western Empire, repented not of the <a id="l2332"></a>works of their hands that they should not worship Ghosts <a id="l2333"></a>&amp; Idols of gold &amp; silver &amp; brass &amp; stone &amp; wood which <a id="l2334"></a>neither can see nor hear nor walk: neither repented they <a id="l2335"></a>of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their <a id="l2336"></a>fornication, nor of their thefts. That the men here <a id="l2337"></a>spoken of are these western  Kingdoms is plain since <a id="l2338"></a>there are not nor have been for many hundreds of <a id="l2339"></a>years any  sort of men besides the Papists within the <a id="l2340"></a>old compas of the Roman Empire which worship Ghosts &amp; Idols. Nor <a id="l2341"></a>are there any others so much guilty of murder as <a id="l2342"></a>these have been by their massacres &amp; daily persecution <a id="l2343"></a>of all those they call heretiques, which since the executi<a id="l2344"></a>on of this plague they have been so far from repent<a id="l2345"></a>ing of that they have exceedingly aggravated it by setting <a id="l2346"></a>up the bloody inquisition. These also are they that stand <a id="l2347"></a>guilty of φαρμακείαι deluding men as it were by magi<a id="l2348"></a>call operations. For what are their miracles which they <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p065r"> &lt;65r&gt; </span> much boast of, &amp; their piæ fraudes but φαρμακείαι <a id="l2349"></a>inchanted love potions of the whore whereby she intoxicates the under<a id="l2350"></a>standings of men, &amp; (as is exprest in ch 18.23) deceives <a id="l2351"></a>the nations. How much also these European nations are guilty <a id="l2352"></a>of fornication is too notorious; especially among the papists <a id="l2353"></a>who blush not to incourage it by tollerating publique stews. <a id="l2354"></a>And I could wish that in the last sin here mentioned, namely <a id="l2355"></a>cheating, exactions, &amp; all kinds of rapaciousness which are <a id="l2356"></a>of the nature of theft, the christians exceeded not even the <a id="l2357"></a>ancient heathens &amp; present Turks. But the heaping up <a id="l2358"></a>riches is the main design of almost all men, nor care <a id="l2359"></a>they by what means, but are so universally addicted to <a id="l2360"></a>overreaching &amp; all kinds of dishonesty that even amongst <a id="l2361"></a>the Turks we are become a reproach &amp; proverb for it.</p>
<p id="par199">11. Having run through the circumstances by which the <a id="l2362"></a>Turkish Empire is characterised, there remains only the <a id="l2363"></a>duration of this wo to be considered. And this I suppose is <a id="l2364"></a>that intervall exprest by an hower &amp; a day &amp; a month <a id="l2365"></a>&amp; a year. For that is the time for which the 4 angels <a id="l2366"></a>were prepared  to slay the third part of men, that <a id="l2367"></a>is, as I interpret, the time of the people of the four an<a id="l2368"></a>gels for which they were prepared to constitute an empire <a id="l2369"></a>upon killing the third part of men, or the time that the <a id="l2370"></a>third part of men should  continue slain by them. For as <a id="l2371"></a>in the former Trumpet the five months expressed the <a id="l2372"></a>main time of that wo &amp; of the  Empire which in<a id="l2373"></a>flicted it, so by analogy must this number do in this <a id="l2374"></a>Trumpet. Now the killing the third part of men be<a id="l2375"></a>ing, as I explained, the dissolution of the Constantino<a id="l2376"></a>politan Empire, we are to date this time from the <a id="l2377"></a>taking of Constantinople whereby the Empire was dissolved <a id="l2378"></a>&amp; this happened May 29<sup>th</sup>, A.C. 1453; from which if we <a id="l2379"></a>therefore count the afforesaid time, recconning (according <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p066r"> &lt;66r&gt; </span> to Saint Iohn's computation ch 12.6, 14 &amp; 11.2, 3) thirty days <a id="l2380"></a>to a month &amp; twelve months to a year, the Turkish <a id="l2381"></a>Empire &amp; there be not a further mystery in the trumpet then I am aware of  may be expected to loose Constantinople its imperial seat in the year 1844,  &amp; perhaps the Emperors may then seat themselves for a time in Iudæa according to what Daniel seems to intend when he saith of this monarch  in the conclusion that he shall plant the Tabernacle of his Palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain Dan 11.45.</p>
<p id="par200">Historians indeed  date this Empire from the reign of Ottoman rather then from the taking of Constantinople, but the rise &amp; fall of Imperial cities being chan<a id="l2383"></a>ges of the greatest  note, the holy Ghost, as I signi<a id="l2384"></a>fied, measures Empires rather by the standing of them then <a id="l2385"></a>by the dominion of single persons. And besides, the Turkish <a id="l2386"></a>dominions before the taking of  Constantinople were but of a <a id="l2387"></a>moderate extent being limited  on the east by Cappadocia <a id="l2388"></a>Paphlagonia &amp; Cilicia which belonged to the Trapezun<a id="l2389"></a>tine Emperor &amp; other kings: so that we may reccon <a id="l2390"></a>this the time when their Empire began to transcend the <a id="l2391"></a>bounds of an ordinary kingdom. For upon this followed <a id="l2392"></a>not only the notable enlargement of their dominions <a id="l2393"></a>into Europe but also into  Paphlagonia Cappadocia, Calchis, Armenia, Cilicia <a id="l2395"></a>Mesopotamia, Syria, Babylon, Arabia, Egypt, &amp; part of Afric; &amp; <a id="l2396"></a>therefore this period may well be accounted the beginning <a id="l2397"></a>of their kingdom to be an Empire, though not the beginning <a id="l2398"></a>of the reign of the Ottoman family.</p>

<p id="par202">I should now proceed to the seventh Trumpet, but since <a id="l2409"></a>that concerns the time to come, it will be better to  return to the things that are contemporary to the Seales &amp; Trumpets already <a id="l2411"></a>explained, &amp; in the next place to describe at large what was hinted  in Posit <span class="hspac-n" title="3 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Arg: 5, concerning the Beast &amp; his horns.</p>
