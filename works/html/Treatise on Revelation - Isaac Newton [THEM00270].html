<h2 id="hd1" class="cent">The Second Book <a id="l1"></a><br>Concerning the method &amp;  synchronisms of <a id="l2"></a>the Apocalyps &amp; the allusions therein to <a id="l3"></a>the Law &amp; History of the Iews</h2>
<h2 id="hd2" class="cent">Chap. 1 <a id="l4"></a><br>Of the daily sacrifice spoken of by Daniel &amp; the <a id="l5"></a>feast of the Passover.</h2>
<h2 id="hd3" class="cent">The Preface</h2>
<p id="par1">As the Prophesies of Daniel consist of two parts an enigmatical <a id="l6"></a>vision &amp; an interpretation so doth this of the Apocalyps.  The AEnigma <a id="l7"></a>reaches  to the end of the <a id="l8"></a>Trumpets, the interpretation thence to the end of the Prophesy.  The first <a id="l9"></a>is a continuall allusion to the law, the second to the history of the <a id="l10"></a>Iews: intimating that by history &amp; the event of things the types of the law are <a id="l11"></a>at length to be  unridled.  For the Temple &amp; ceremonies of the law were <a id="l12"></a>types &amp; shadows of things to come Coloss. 2.16, 17. Heb. 9.9, 23, 24 &amp; 10.1.  The <a id="l13"></a> allusions to the law are partly in describing the Christian worship &amp; partly <a id="l14"></a>in predicting things future.  The first is done by allusions to the Iewish <a id="l15"></a>daily worship, the second by allusions to the Feast of the seventh month. <a id="l16"></a>The allusions to the daily worship are as follows.</p>
<h2 id="hd4" class="cent">Sect. 1 <a id="l17"></a><br>The Lamps drest</h2>
<p id="par2">The Iewish service <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> began every morning with the sounding <a id="l18"></a>of Trumpets &amp; opening of the Temple &amp; killing of the morning sacrifice <a id="l19"></a>together, &amp; dressing of the Lamps immediately after.  The Lamps <a id="l20"></a>were dressed by the Priests in their lots &amp; on the Fast of the seventh <a id="l21"></a>month &amp; seven days before by the High Priest.  In allusion to all <a id="l22"></a>this the Prophet in the beginning of the Prophesy hears a great <a id="l23"></a>voice as of a Trumpet (a singular being put for a plural as <a id="l24"></a>is usually in this Prophesy) &amp; turning to the voice sees one <a id="l25"></a>like the Son of man (our great High Priest) cloathed with a robe <a id="l26"></a>reaching down to the foot &amp; girt about with a golden girdle <a id="l27"></a>For this was the High Priest's habit.  In allusion to the Temples <a id="l28"></a>being now opened, for the people to enter from below, he saith <a id="l29"></a>he hath the keys of Death &amp; of Hades, that is the Keys of the gates <a id="l30"></a>from death into the Kingdom of heaven.  For they are <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n3-ref">[3]</sup> afterward <a id="l31"></a>called the Key of David with which Christ opens &amp; no man can shut, <a id="l32"></a>&amp; shuts &amp; no man can open &amp; opens a door to the Church of Philadelphia <a id="l33"></a>that is with which he lets into the Kingdom of David &amp; shuts out of <a id="l34"></a>it whom he pleases.  And therefore they are the Key of the door <a id="l35"></a>in heaven so often opened in the following prophesy, that is the Key of <a id="l36"></a>the Temple or Tabernacle in heaven wherein God has his Throne &amp; worship. <a id="l37"></a>For Keys must respect the doors of buildings &amp; there is no other <a id="l38"></a>building or door in all this prophesy.  Now the door of the Kingdom <a id="l39"></a>of heaven represented by this Temple or Tabernacle he had newly <a id="l40"></a>opened with these keys by his resurrection from the dead, &amp; this he <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p002r"> &lt;2r&gt; </span> intimates by having them in his hand as if he had been newly <a id="l41"></a>using them &amp; by calling them the Keys of death &amp; Hades, &amp; saying <a id="l42"></a>He was dead &amp; is alive for evermore.  In allusion to the morning <a id="l43"></a>sacrifice newly slain he was dead, &amp; in allusion to the High Priest <a id="l44"></a>dressing the Lamps he is alive &amp; walks in the midst of the seven <a id="l45"></a>golden candlesticks  in the Temple or Tabernacle. For as the Son of Man by his High <a id="l47"></a>Priests habit &amp; the Keys is known to be within the courts of the Tem<a id="l48"></a>ple or Tabernacle so the Candlesticks by their being of Gold &amp; <a id="l49"></a>sacred ones &amp; placed in their places Apoc. 2.5. are manifested <a id="l50"></a>to be the Candlesticks of the Temple.  The face of the Son of Man <a id="l51"></a>shining as the Sun &amp; the seven stars in his right hand have re<a id="l52"></a>spect to heaven &amp; the Apocalyptic heaven is the Tabernacle or <a id="l53"></a>Temple.  Nor is it any just objection that the Temple is not men<a id="l54"></a>tioned here; for tis certainly to be understood in the 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; 5<sup>t</sup> Chap<a id="l55"></a>ters of the Apocalyps without being mentioned there.  The Taber<a id="l56"></a>nacle or Temple is the common scene of all the apocalyptic <a id="l57"></a>visions &amp; therefore to be understood as well here as in other <a id="l58"></a>places.  Conceive therefore that the son of man  appears in the <a id="l59"></a>Tabernacle or Temple in the region of the Candlesticks, &amp; that the  Prophet <a id="l60"></a>standing before the Temple sees him there through the fire <a id="l61"></a>of the Altar, with his feet as it were upon the coals of <a id="l62"></a>the Altar &amp; his face in the bright flames therof.  For <a id="l63"></a>this the Prophet intimates by describing his eyes like flames <a id="l64"></a>of fire &amp; his countenance as the Sun shineth in his strength <a id="l65"></a>&amp; his feet like <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n4-ref">[4]</sup> amber as if they burned in a furnace that is <a id="l66"></a>like coales of burning fire.  The seven golden Candlesticks you may <a id="l67"></a>conceive to be  the sevenfold candlestick of the Tabernacle.  For <a id="l68"></a>as Moses gives the name of Candlestick to the middle branch of the <a id="l69"></a>seven Exod 25.34, so may the other six branches be accounted <a id="l70"></a>the candlesticks of their proper lamps.  These lamps were placed <a id="l71"></a>on the south side of the holy place at a little distance from the wall <a id="l72"></a> in a right line inclined from it  towards the Ark.  Whence the <a id="l73"></a>High Priest in dressing them would stand between them &amp; the most Holy  &amp; <a id="l74"></a>so might look with his face towards the Prophet standing beyond the <a id="l75"></a>fire of the great Altar.  He is said to  appear &amp; walk in the midst of these candle<a id="l76"></a>sticks that is  over against the midst of them.  For <a id="l77"></a>so the Prophet afterwards uses the phrase when he saith that the <a id="l78"></a>Lamb &amp; two of the four Beasts were in the midst of the Throne.  <a id="l79"></a>He hath in his right hand seven starrs that is the seven lamps of the <a id="l80"></a>candlesticks.  For these stars are the seven Angels of the Churches <a id="l81"></a>Apoc. 1.20 that is the seven spirits of God Apoc 3.1 &amp; consequently the <a id="l82"></a>seven lamps Apoc. 4.5.  The candlesticks are the Churches Apoc. 1.20 <a id="l83"></a>&amp; therefore the starrs in being the Angels of the Churches are the <a id="l84"></a>lights of the Candlesticks &amp; the Churches in being the candlesticks of <a id="l85"></a>the Angels Apoc. 2.5 are the candlesticks of the starry lights.  These <a id="l86"></a>Lamps being viewed at a distance would appear like starrs &amp; therefore <a id="l87"></a>in a vision are fitly called so, &amp; that the rather because the Tabernacle is <a id="l88"></a>made the type of heaven.  For the starrs of this heaven are no other  <a id="l89"></a>then are the lamps.  They are said to be in his right hand to signify that <a id="l90"></a>they appeared on that side of the tabernacle towards his right hand &amp; <a id="l91"></a>that his hand was employed in dressing them.  For being almost in a right <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span>    line with the Prophets' eyes, they might appear to him neare one another so as to seem to be in the right hand of the son of man.  Now these lights he dresses &amp; trims in the seven <a id="l94"></a>Epistles by telling them that he knows their works &amp; faith &amp; patience, <a id="l95"></a>searcheth the reins &amp; hearts, &amp; by commending, reproving, instructing <a id="l96"></a>exhorting &amp; threatning every one according to his condition.  As the <a id="l97"></a>Lamps used to be in a decayed condition before dressing, so were <a id="l98"></a>the Angels of the Churches.  One had left his first love, another was <a id="l99"></a>infected with the idolatrous doctrine of the Nicolaitans, a third suf<a id="l100"></a>fered the woman Iezabel, a fourth was ready to dy, a fift grown <a id="l101"></a>luke warm.  And therefore he endeavours to correct &amp; restore <a id="l102"></a>these to their first lustre, admonishing them to repent &amp; do <a id="l103"></a>their first works.  Into the other two which were faultless, he instills <a id="l104"></a>the oyl of exhortations encouragments and promises for pre<a id="l105"></a>serving their light.</p>
<p id="par3">Conceive all this to be done on the Lords day, as the Prophet <a id="l106"></a>tells you, that is <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n5-ref">[5]</sup> on the solemnity of his resurrection whether the <a id="l107"></a>weekly or the annual &amp; so to respect both the weekly christian worship <a id="l108"></a>on that day, &amp; the resurrection of Christ on the first of those days.  <a id="l109"></a>For therefore he saith, I was dead &amp; behold I am alive for <a id="l110"></a>evermore, as if he was just risen; &amp; calls his keys the Keys of <a id="l111"></a>death &amp; Hades rather then of heaven, as if he had newly <a id="l112"></a>brought 'em with him from the dead.  The design of the Prophesy <a id="l113"></a>here is to delineate the Christian worship by allusions to the Iewish, <a id="l114"></a>&amp; therefore he tells you in the beginning that it was on the Lords <a id="l115"></a>day (the day of our worship) that these visions appeared.   First by <a id="l116"></a>Epistles sent to the Angels of the Churches for them to instruct <a id="l117"></a>the people, he describes &amp; gives directions for the Christian preach<a id="l118"></a>ing on the Lords day.  And in the next place he proceeds to des<a id="l119"></a>cribe the Christian worship in the Churches as you shal presently <a id="l120"></a>hear.  For seeing the seven Angels of the Churches are here <a id="l121"></a>writ unto, &amp; told of their faith, charity, patience, works, and <a id="l122"></a>labour in their Churches, &amp; instructed, exhorted, commended, reproved, as men set over them, &amp; afterwards described in the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>people<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> cloathed in white Linnen &amp; girt about their breasts with <a id="l123"></a>golden girdles which was the Priests habit <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Apoc<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> 15, 6 &amp; blew the Trum<a id="l124"></a>pets (Apoc. 8) which none but the Priests did.  <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Iewish Priests are <a id="l125"></a>alluded unto in these Angels &amp; so the Christian Bishops are sign<a id="l126"></a>ified by them.  The Iews used to call their Doctors of the Law <a id="l127"></a>the Candles of the Lord &amp; the Christian Doctors are the light of the <a id="l128"></a>world (Matt. 5.14) &amp; therefore they are fitly signified by stars <a id="l129"></a>&amp; Lamps.  But the meaning of the Candlesticks &amp; Stars &amp; of some other visions which follow will best ap<a id="l130"></a>pear by considering the constitution of the Churches which they repre<a id="l131"></a>sent.  And this will be best understood by considering the constitu<a id="l132"></a>tion of the Iewish Synagogues from whence they were propagated.  <a id="l133"></a>For the government of the Churches <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>by Bishops<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Presbyters &amp; Deacons <a id="l134"></a>was not instituted by Christ &amp; his Apostles but by Ezra &amp; ap<a id="l135"></a>proved by Christ, &amp; afterwards used by the Christian Iews before the conver<a id="l136"></a>sion of Cornelius, while they were yet all of them zealous of the law <a id="l137"></a>&amp; continued as much one &amp; the same Church with the rest of the Iews as the <a id="l138"></a>several sects of the Iews did with one another the nation of the unbeleiving Iews <a id="l139"></a>being not yet rejected from being the Church of God. Now the go<a id="l140"></a>vernment of the synagogues was on this manner.<sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup>  A synagogue might <a id="l141"></a>be instituted (say the Iews) in any City where there were ten men of leasure &amp; <a id="l142"></a>learning in the Law, whereof three are the Magistrates &amp; were <a id="l143"></a>called Rulers of the Synagogue &amp; the Bench of three.  This counsel <a id="l144"></a>was to those of the Synagogue what the great Sanedrim was to the <a id="l145"></a>whole nation .  They judged of controversies, of crimes, of the <a id="l146"></a>admission of Proselytes, of laying on of hands &amp; the like.  This was the <a id="l147"></a>proper office of the Presbyters. Whence the Apostle saith, Let the Elders <a id="l148"></a>that rule well &amp;c.  A fourth person was the publick Minister of the Sy<a id="l149"></a>nagogue, whose office was to read the publick prayers &amp; to take care <a id="l150"></a>of reading the Law, &amp; sometimes he preached when there were not <a id="l151"></a>other fit persons at hand to do it.  He did not read the law himself <a id="l152"></a>but called any seven fit persons out of the congregation to do it, every <a id="l153"></a>one reading a part &amp; he inspecting the reader, &amp; correcting him if he <a id="l154"></a>read any thing falsly or improperly; whence he was called חזן the <a id="l155"></a>Chazan, that is the overseer or Bishop of the congregation.  They called <a id="l156"></a>him also שליח ציבזר the Angel of the Church.  Besides these there <a id="l157"></a>were three Deacons or Almoners on whom was the care of the poor.  Two <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span>  of them demanded alms of the townsmen, &amp; the third distributed it: &amp; these <a id="l158"></a>three were called Parnasim, Pastors, &amp; by the Christian Greeks Διάκονοι <a id="l159"></a>Deacons or Ministers from the ministration of Alms &amp; serving of Tables <a id="l160"></a>Act. 6.1, 2.  There might be more then three if needfull, as in the first <a id="l161"></a>Christian synagogue, where there were seven, but three was the usual <a id="l162"></a>number, &amp; fewer then three there might not be.  And the same is to be <a id="l163"></a>understood of the Presbyters.  There were other three officers of less note to make <a id="l164"></a>up ten: one of which was the interpreter whose office was to speak aloud to the <a id="l165"></a>people in the vulgar tongue what the Reader whispered to him in the sacred.  <a id="l166"></a>To him Christ alludes, when he saith, what ye hear in the ear that preach <a id="l167"></a>on the house tops.  But the first seven comprehended the constitution of a Christian <a id="l168"></a>Church, &amp; seem to be those whom the Iews called the seven good men of the city, <a id="l169"></a>of which saith Dr Lightfoot there is frequent mention in the Talmudists.  And <a id="l170"></a>of these seven the Bishop being the Doctor of the Law, was in their language called <a id="l171"></a>the Lamp or Candle of the Lord, as well as the Angel of the Church.  So then the <a id="l172"></a>Bishops of the seven Churches are the seven lights represented by the seven stars.  &amp; seven lamps, &amp; called the seven Angels of the Churches &amp; seven spirits of <a id="l173"></a>God.  Thus are they but seven, &amp; yet every Bishop if you either refer <a id="l174"></a>to his mystical body the three Presbyters &amp; three Deacons, or consider him in respect <a id="l175"></a>of the seven Readers, is a sevenfold light of each Candlestick.  In several res<a id="l176"></a>pects you may therefore consider them either as the seven Lamps of the Mo<a id="l177"></a>saicall Candlestick, or as the seven sevenfold lights of seven such Candlesticks.  <a id="l178"></a>In both cases there are seven Churches and seven Bishops, Angels, <a id="l179"></a>Spirits or Stars &amp; no more.  They are numbred as single persons <a id="l180"></a>by the seven Lamps &amp; Seven Stars &amp; Seven Spirits of God, &amp;  yet <a id="l181"></a> are not merely single persons but have each of them <a id="l182"></a>their mystical bodies of Priests &amp; Deacons &amp; other  assistants &amp; attendants so that a star or Angel may <a id="l185"></a>signify the whole body of Teachers &amp; Ministers of every Church.  For <a id="l186"></a>all single persons in this Prophesy have their mystical bodies.  To such <a id="l187"></a>Angels as these are the Epistles sent, and not only to them, but to the <a id="l188"></a>whole Churches.  For therefore is it said in every Epistle, <em class="underline">He that <a id="l189"></a>hath an ear let him  hear what the spirit saith unto the churches.</em> This exhortation to hear, being repeated in every epistle is a sufficient insinuation that the spirit preaches in these Epistles.  This preaching . . . <a id="l190"></a>This preaching to the Churches consists in stirring them up to works, <a id="l191"></a>faith, charity, patience, perseverance under tribulation, &amp; labour <a id="l192"></a>for the truth, and mainly in exhorting them against the idolatry of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p006r"> &lt;6r&gt; </span>  the times, &amp; instructing them  in sacred prophesy, by the <a id="l193"></a>study of which they may learn who the Idolaters are, and wherein <a id="l194"></a>their idolatry consists, and so by avoiding it obtain the eter<a id="l195"></a>nal reward set before them.  This preaching to the Churches on the Lords day being ended, the divine worship on the same <a id="l196"></a>day now follows.</p>

<h2 id="hd5" class="cent">Sect. II. <a id="l197"></a><br>The morning sacrifice</h2>
<p id="par4"><em class="underline">After this</em>, saith the Prophet; <em class="underline">I looked and behold a door</em> <a id="l198"></a>[not opening but already] <em class="underline">opened in heaven, and I heard the <a id="l199"></a>first voice as the voice of a Trumpet talking with me, and <a id="l200"></a>saying: Come up hither</em>.  This voice being the second sounding <a id="l201"></a>of the Trumpet called the Prophet to see the solemnity of the <a id="l202"></a>morning sacrifice.  For the Trumpets every day sounded <a id="l203"></a>thrice: first at the opening of the gates of the Temple, then <a id="l204"></a>at the morning, and lastly at the evening sacrifice.  The <a id="l205"></a>door opened in heaven was the door of the Temple.  For the <a id="l206"></a>land of Iudea &amp; therein the Temple is the  common scene of all the Apocalyptic visions: &amp; the  <a id="l207"></a>Temple as being God's dwelling place, and a representation of <a id="l208"></a>heavenly things (Heb. 8.5 &amp; 9.9, 23, 24) is put for heaven .  Conceive that the Prophet in the former vision stood  without the temple before the east gate, &amp; was then shewn only what was pertinent  to be  observed; but now upon a fuller shew of all things is called up into the  court of the Temple &amp; came up into the east gate of  the outward court to view the whole before him.</p>
<p id="par5"> And immediately saith he, I was  in the <a id="l211"></a><em class="underline">Spirit, &amp;  behold a throne set in heaven, &amp; one sat on the throne</em>   The throne is the Adytum or most holy place <a id="l213"></a>in the Temple.  The seat of the throne is over the Ark, between the <a id="l214"></a>Cherubims, &amp; he that sits thereon the great God of Israel, the creatour <a id="l215"></a>of all things as he is afterwards called.  For the Iewish Church considered <a id="l216"></a>God as dwelling amongst them, first in the Tabernacle, &amp; then in the <a id="l217"></a>Temple (Exod. 25.8 &amp; 25.42, 43, 44 &amp; Levit. 26.11, 12.2 Sam. 7.5, 6.  1 King. <a id="l218"></a>8.13, 17) not in the holy place which was enlightened with lamps, but in the thick <a id="l219"></a>darkness of the most holy place 91 King. 8.12. 2. Chron. 6.1) over the Mercy Seat between <a id="l220"></a>the Cherubins (1 Sam. 4.4. 2 Sam. 6.2, 2 King. 19.15. 1 Chron. 13.6. Psal. 80.1, &amp; 99.1. <a id="l221"></a>Isa 37.16.) Whither Moses always went to speak with God (Exod. 25.22. Num 7.89) &amp; therefore <a id="l222"></a>the Iews considered all things done before the most holy place as done before the Lord (Levit 24.4, <a id="l223"></a>6. Exod. 30.8. Levit. 1.3. Num. 16.16, 17 &amp;c) &amp; always prayed towards the Temple as <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> toward the place of Gods presence (1 King. 8.30, 33, 35, 38 &amp;c. Dan. 6.10.) <a id="l224"></a>So Isaiah in a vision like this of the Apocalyps saw the Lord sitting <a id="l225"></a>upon his throne &amp; his train filled the Temple (Isa. 6.)  And in Ezekiels <a id="l226"></a>vision of the  Temple the Lord upon a throne of Cherubims entred into <a id="l227"></a>the house &amp; filled it with his glory &amp; said: Son of man, the place <a id="l228"></a>of my throne &amp; the place of the soles of any feet where I will <a id="l229"></a>dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, Ezek. 43.  So in <a id="l230"></a> the Apocalyptick visions, the throne is in <a id="l231"></a>the temple.  For the Temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God <a id="l232"></a>&amp; consequently from the throne within it, ch. 15.8.  There came a voice <a id="l233"></a>out of the Temple of heaven from the Throne ch 16.17 &amp; the Palm <a id="l234"></a>bearing multitude being before the throne  serve God day &amp; night in <a id="l235"></a>his Temple ch 7.15.  Whence also we have the utensils &amp; parts of the <a id="l236"></a>Temple described about the Throne, namely the seven Lamps burning be<a id="l237"></a>fore it Apoc 4.5, the  Laver or brazen sea of crystalline water, <a id="l238"></a>called here the sea of glass  like unto crystall  <a id="l239"></a>ch. 4.6  the golden altar whereon incense is offered before the Throne <a id="l240"></a>with a golden censer  ch 8.3, 4 &amp; 9.13 the great Altar ch 6.9 &amp; 11.1 <a id="l241"></a>the Ark of the Testament ch. 11.9 &amp; the outward Court ch. 11.1.  All <a id="l242"></a>which plainly shew the Scene of the Visions to be Iudea &amp; in <a id="l243"></a>Iudea, the Temple.</p>

Thereby you may know also that there was a <a id="l250"></a>cloud of falling rain in the region of the throne.  Clouds suit well with the <a id="l251"></a>throne of God in heaven &amp; rain is the embleme of his blessings on <a id="l252"></a>mankind.  Out of this cloud conceive the thunders to proceed which are <a id="l253"></a> afterwards said together  with the lightnings to proceed out of the throne.  <a id="l254"></a>The green colour of the  rain-bow represents well the vegetable fa<a id="l255"></a>culty of the rain.  For all vegetables are green &amp; tis by rain that they <a id="l256"></a>spring up &amp; grow.  To denote that God is the author of their life &amp; growth <a id="l257"></a>his appearance is like a jasper &amp; a Saphire, that is  of a celestial <a id="l258"></a>green &amp; red the green colour referring to the vegetable rain, water the <a id="l259"></a>mother or passive principle out of which all things grow &amp; are nourished &amp; the red to the naturall fire &amp; heat, the form &amp; life or  active principle of all growing things.  For the red is that which Ezekiel &amp; Daniel in the <a id="l260"></a>like visions describe by the colour of amber &amp; appearance of fire &amp; this red fiery colour you may conceive to arise from the fire of the Altar through which the throne appeared. Ezek. 1.27 Dan. 7.10.  Now <a id="l261"></a>all this is to represent him that sits upon the throne to be the eternal author &amp; maker of all things <a id="l262"></a>in answer to the title &amp; worship which is afterwards given him,  where the Elders <em class="underline">worship him that liveth <a id="l263"></a>for ever,  &amp; cast their crowns before the throne saying: Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory &amp; honour &amp; power, for thou hast created all things &amp; for <a id="l264"></a>thy pleasure they are</em> [daily] <em class="underline">&amp; were</em> [at first] <em class="underline">created</em>.

<p id="par7"><em class="underline">And in the circuit of the throne were four &amp; twenty seats &amp; upon <a id="l268"></a>the seats were four &amp; twenty Elders sitting cloathed in white raiment <a id="l269"></a>&amp; they had  upon their heads crowns of gold</em>.  These Elders by their numbers  <a id="l270"></a>twenty four,  by their distinct seats about the throne, by their white garments which <a id="l271"></a>were worn only by the Priests in the Temple, by their crowns <a id="l272"></a>upon their heads which denote them Princes, by their having Harps &amp; Vialls of incense ch 5.8 &amp; by their <a id="l273"></a>being called Kings &amp; Priests ch 5.10 are the four &amp; twenty Princes of <a id="l274"></a>the Priests each with his course  of Priests &amp; Levites under him, &amp; <a id="l275"></a>their thrones  are their chambers in the circuit of the inner court.  <a id="l276"></a>For the <sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> Priests &amp; Levites were divided each into four &amp; twenty courses <a id="l277"></a>or families which served in their turns in the Temple by weeks each course one week.  Only upon festival days they seemed all <a id="l278"></a>together.  Each course of Priests had its course of Levites under it <a id="l279"></a>&amp; over it a Prince, &amp; their  seats in the Temple were on <a id="l280"></a>this manner.  The Court of the Priests was a square an hundred <a id="l281"></a>cubits long &amp; as mann broad  having the altar in <a id="l282"></a>the middle &amp; over against the middle of the Altar eastward north<a id="l283"></a>ward &amp; southward three gates, one in the middle of each side.   <a id="l284"></a>On the west  side was the separate place being another square <a id="l285"></a>equal to the former &amp; conteining the Temple.  Both squares together <a id="l286"></a>made a rectangle an hundred cubits  broad &amp; two hundred long, <a id="l287"></a>surrounded with  the buildings of the Priests chambers on  three sides but on the <a id="l288"></a>fourth side which was west, there were neither chambers nor a Gate <a id="l289"></a>but only a wall.  The chambers of greatest dignity were before the <a id="l290"></a> Throne on that <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> east side of the court next the east Gate, &amp; <a id="l291"></a>from thence they decreased gradually in dignity in their progress <a id="l292"></a>on both sides the court &amp; separate place to the west end.  From <a id="l293"></a>the east Gate <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> on both sides down to the north &amp; south gates were <a id="l294"></a>the Chambers of the high  Priest &amp; his  chief officers who had the <a id="l295"></a>charge &amp; government of the Temple &amp; Altar &amp; whom the <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> Iews place before the Princes of the courses.  From those Gates to <a id="l296"></a>the separate place were the four &amp; twenty chambers of the Princes <a id="l297"></a>of the Priests, twelve on each side, four below stairs with a cloister <a id="l298"></a>before them looking into the court, &amp; eight above.  And from thence <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> on <a id="l299"></a>their side the separate place to the said western wall reached the <a id="l300"></a>chambers of the four &amp; twenty courses of the Priests when they ate the <a id="l301"></a>sacred things.  I speake of Solomons Temple whose form &amp; constitution  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p008r"> &lt;8r&gt; </span>  is described by Ezekiel &amp; was in some measure preserved in the second <a id="l302"></a>Temple: Concerning which I may perhaps on some other occasion give a <a id="l303"></a>fuller account, those who have hitherto wrote on this subject much <a id="l304"></a>mistaking the form of both Temples.  Single persons in this Prophesy <a id="l305"></a>every where signifying mystically comprehend multitudes in their <a id="l306"></a>mystical bodies.  So the Lamb by his horns &amp; eyes &amp; the son of <a id="l307"></a>man in the High Priests habit by his voice as the voice as the voice of many <a id="l308"></a>waters ch 1.15 represents a multitude.  For waters signify multitudes ch. 17.15.  <a id="l309"></a> But chiefly &amp; most immediately in this High Priests mystical <a id="l310"></a>body were included his ministers in the government of the Temple, <a id="l311"></a>those who being seated in the Temple with him above the four &amp; <a id="l312"></a>twenty Princes, sat together dayly in Councel in one of his <a id="l313"></a>Chambers for ordering the affairs of the Temple.  These were  the <a id="l314"></a>Counsel of the Temple as the Sanedrim was the Counsel of the <a id="l315"></a> nation, &amp; sat in the seat of Aaron as those did in the <a id="l316"></a>seat of Moses; &amp; so being the High Priests Counsel &amp; bearing his <a id="l317"></a>authority are properly referred to his family &amp; person,  as distinct from the four &amp; twenty Princes.  These Coun<a id="l319"></a>sellours were  first two fellow officers called Katholikim &amp; then <a id="l320"></a>seven fellow officers called Imarcilia: over all which presided the High Priests <a id="l321"></a> vicegerent called the Sagan.  These having the whole  inspection <a id="l322"></a>&amp; care of the Temple were to the High Priest instead of eyes.  <a id="l323"></a>To the seven  with their under officers answer the  <a id="l324"></a>seven eyes of the Lamb &amp; to the two the two eyes of the Son of man.  <a id="l325"></a>For the ✝  And as the High Priest has his mystical body so have the <a id="l326"></a>four &amp; twenty Elders their several mystical bodies, each <a id="l327"></a>comprehending the  course of Priests under him to<a id="l328"></a>gether with the course of Levites under them.  For the Levites were given to the Priests to minister under them Num. 3.6, 9, 32 &amp; 4.19, 27 <a id="l329"></a>&amp; so belong to them as servants to the parishes of their masters.  <a id="l330"></a>Whence the Elders have every one of them a harp as well <a id="l331"></a>as a vial of incense ch 5.8.  As Priests them offer incense &amp; <a id="l332"></a>as Levites they handle the Harp in the song of the Temple.  <a id="l333"></a>And thus in the high Priest &amp; four &amp; twenty Elders together <a id="l334"></a>we have represented the whole inward Court.</p>
<p id="par8"><em class="underline">And out of the throne proceeded high things &amp; thundrings <a id="l335"></a>&amp; voices</em>  Thundrings are in this prophesy put for loud voices of <a id="l336"></a>a multitude.  They are the voice of a cloud &amp; a cloud signifies a multitude.  So when the Prophet had heard a great voice of <a id="l337"></a>much people in heaven (that is aloft in the Temple) saying <a id="l338"></a>Alleluiah, in describing further what that multitude said he <a id="l339"></a>addeth that he heard as it were the voice of a great multi<a id="l340"></a>tude &amp; as the voice of many waters, &amp; as the voice of mighty <a id="l341"></a>thundrings saying Alleluia, for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth &amp;c. <a id="l342"></a> ch 19.  So again the Prophet heard a voice from heaven as the <a id="l343"></a>voice of many waters &amp; as the voice of a great thunder &amp; also <a id="l344"></a>the voice of harpers harping with their harps: &amp; they sang as it <a id="l345"></a>were a new song before the throne &amp; before the four beasts <a id="l346"></a>&amp; the elders ch. 14.3.  This voice therefore came from the Priests court <a id="l347"></a>in the Temple in heaven &amp; so was the musick of the Temple <a id="l348"></a>consisting partly of the voices of singers called the voices of many <a id="l349"></a>waters that is of many people &amp; partly of the noise of harps.  <a id="l350"></a>The song was sung by the articulate voice of the many waters accom <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span>  panied with the inarticulate Musick of the Harps.  And this articulate <a id="l351"></a>voice being called a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters <a id="l352"></a>&amp; as the voice of a great Thunder shews that thunder is put for <a id="l353"></a>the loud vocal Musick of the Temple.  So then the thundrings <a id="l354"></a>&amp; voices which proceed out of the Throne are the thundring  voices <a id="l355"></a>of the Temple musick, called thundrings to express the loudness <a id="l356"></a>&amp; voices to express the articulateness thereof.  Where tis obvious <a id="l357"></a>thereof the lightnings are the fire of the Altar  now Disturbed by the morning sacrifice laid thereon.  At <a id="l359"></a>this sacrifice  the Priests  blew the Trumpets <a id="l360"></a> &amp; the Levites sang by turnes.  The Prophet  by the voice of the Trumpets sounding together as <a id="l362"></a>one Trumpet being called  up into the temple &amp; having now from the east gate  the prospect of the whole Temple <a id="l363"></a>before him, sees the fire of the Altar over against the throne <a id="l364"></a>&amp; heares the song of the Levites from the same region, as if <a id="l365"></a>they were lightnings &amp; thundrings proceeding from the throne, <a id="l366"></a>&amp; describes them according to their appearance.  Whence we may <a id="l367"></a>learn that wherever voices thundrings &amp; lightnings are mentioned <a id="l368"></a>they denote a sacrifice accompanied with the Temple.</p>
<p id="par9">From this appearance of the throne behind the fire of the Altar are taken also <span class="ns">♁</span> see the backside <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 9v &gt; </span>also the descriptions of the throne of God in the old Prophets.  For in Daniel the head &amp; garments of the Ancient of days appeared white like the top of the flame or as smoke useth to do above the flame, &amp; under his throne  was like the fiery flames &amp; under it the wheels of his throne  as burning fire, &amp; a fiery streame issued [from below] &amp; [ after the manner of flame  ascending upward] came forth from before him, Dan 7.  And in Ezekiel the Cherubins which supported the throne appeared like burning coales of fire &amp; sparkled like the colour of burnished copper &amp; out of the fire went forth lightning (that is a flame flashing like lightning, that lightning which in the Apocalyps proceedeth out of the throne &amp; in Daniel is called a fiery streame issuing from before him) &amp; the wheels of the throne (whose rings here appeared very high) were like unto the colour of beryl, that is  inclining to green or the faint colour of flame on either side; &amp; between the <a id="l369"></a> wheels under the Cherubims were coales of fire.  Upon the throne was the appearance of a man &amp; within it the colour of amber as the appearance of fire; &amp; about the throne a brightness like the bow that is in the clouds in the day of rain.  And when Ezekiel stood at the north gate of the temple the throne stood not in its place in the most holy but on the right side of the house Ezek 10.3 that is on the south side of the altar, ch. 47.1, &amp; so still appeared through the fire of the altar.  All which compared with the appearance of the throne in the Apocalyps, illustrates &amp; sufficiently confirms our exposition.  The sacred fire is an embleme of the Deity; for God is a consuming fire: &amp; for that reason tis always joyned with the ark &amp; cherubins in the description of his throne.  For the same reason also the son of man standing in the region of the fire of the altar is represented in a fiery form, his leggs appearing like pillars of fire burning as in a furnace,  or as Daniel expresseth it like burnished copper, his eyes &amp; countenance like flame &amp; his  haire white as is the top of flame.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 9r resumes &gt; </span></p>

<p id="par11">And in the midst of the throne &amp; circuit of the throne were four Beasts full of eyes before &amp; behind  The Prophet having <a id="l378"></a>hitherto described the  Temple &amp; inner Court proceeds <a id="l379"></a>now to the outer.

And <a id="l383"></a>presented here by four Beasts in the four sides thereof.  And <a id="l384"></a><em class="underline">In the midst of the throne &amp; circuit of the throne were four beasts</em> <a id="l385"></a>that is  one before &amp; <a id="l386"></a>another behind the throne, both which to the Prophet standing at the eat gate appeared in the midst of the throne &amp; two  in the circuit on either hand.  <a id="l387"></a>It seems to be an Hebrew way of speaking for so in the  <a id="l388"></a>Gates of the Temple which had arches on either hand with little <a id="l389"></a>chambers in their Posts, Ezekiel (chap 40) saith there were windows <a id="l390"></a>in the arches round about within.  And so the thrones of the Elders <a id="l391"></a>which were only on both sides the Prophet Iohn saith were in the <a id="l392"></a>circuit of the Throne &amp; the wings of these Beasts which were not in the middle before &amp; behind but on their sides he saith were about them.  So also the Lamb who was over against the <a id="l393"></a>middle of the throne he saith was in the middle &amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup>  Iosephus an <a id="l394"></a>Hebrew contemporary to the Prophet, to expres that the temple <a id="l395"></a>was over against the middle of the Eastern side of the outward <a id="l396"></a>Court saith it was in the middle of it.  These Beasts because <a id="l397"></a>they worship God together with the Elders &amp; say that Christ hath <a id="l398"></a>redeemed them to God by his blood out of every kindred <a id="l399"></a>&amp; tongue &amp; people &amp; nation &amp;c do plainly signify the Christian Church &amp; so allude to the people of Israel assembled in the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span>  four sides of the great Court of the Temple.  Beasts are the proper type <a id="l400"></a>of multitudes &amp; because such multitudes seen from above appeare with <a id="l401"></a>heads &amp; eyes all over, these beasts are described full of eyes: which eyes <a id="l402"></a>are said to be before &amp; behind to express the quicksightedness of the people <a id="l403"></a>of God in discerning divine mysteries in reference to times before <a id="l404"></a>&amp; behind us or future &amp; past.  But whilst I place the people of <a id="l405"></a>Israel in the four sides of the outward Court I understand it <a id="l406"></a>of the first Temple when all the twelve tribes of Israel were <a id="l407"></a>in the land together.  For all the tribes are alluded to in these <a id="l408"></a>Beasts &amp; the great court which was the court of Israel in the first <a id="l409"></a>Temple, became the court of the Gentiles in the second as shal be shewed hereafter.</p>
<p id="par12"><em class="underline">The first Beast was like a Lyon, the second like a Calf, the <a id="l410"></a>third had a face like a man &amp; the fourth was like a flying Eagle,</em> <a id="l411"></a>These representations of the four quarters of Israel are taken from the <a id="l412"></a>standards of the tribes in the wilderness.  For the frame of the Temple <a id="l413"></a>is analogous to their encamping there.  The Priests &amp; Levites encamped <a id="l414"></a>next about the  Tabernacle answerable to the inward Court <a id="l415"></a>of the Temple,  &amp; round about them were the twelve Tribes in four quarters to the four winds answerable to the outward <a id="l416"></a>Court, &amp; in each quarter were three tribes under one standart as <a id="l417"></a>you may read in Numb. 1 &amp; 2.  The names of the standarts are <a id="l418"></a>not there set down, but the Iewish Doctors <sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> by tradition teach that the eastern standart was a Lyon, the western an Ox, the southern a man &amp; the northern an Eagle.  So Ezekiel (chap 1).<sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> looking northward &amp; <a id="l419"></a>seing a vision of four beasts each with four faces which looked <a id="l420"></a>four ways &amp; turned not from their quarters; &amp; naming their faces in order, puts first the face of a man, then the face of a <a id="l421"></a>Lyon to the right side that is eastward &amp; the face of an ox to <a id="l422"></a>the left side that is westward &amp; the face of an eagle last.  The face <a id="l423"></a>he first names was doubtless that most in view &amp; consequently the <a id="l424"></a>southern which looked full upon him.  Whence the Eagles face was <a id="l425"></a>to the north.   These Beasts Ezekiel afterwards (chap. 10) calls <a id="l426"></a>Cherubins &amp; describes them to be full of eyes: so that they resemble <a id="l427"></a>the Apocalyptick beasts, but yet with this difference that one Cherubin <a id="l428"></a>with four faces to the four winds signifies what all four Apoca<a id="l429"></a>lyptick Beasts (each with but one of those faces) do together, that <a id="l430"></a>is, all the four quarters of the Church.  Whence they are placed <a id="l431"></a>not at a distance from the throne to the four winds like the Apocalyp<a id="l432"></a>tick beasts but in the center even in the throne it self as suppor<a id="l433"></a>ters thereof like the two Cherubins on either end the Ark.  For as those two joyn their wings together so do Ezekiels four &amp; as God is <a id="l434"></a>said to sit &amp; dwell between those two &amp; ride upon their wings so his throne is placed upon Ezekiels four his sitting &amp; riding upon them denoting his reigning over Israel.  As those two are called the <a id="l435"></a>Chariot of the Cherubins, 1 Chron 28.18, so these have wheels to signify <a id="l436"></a>that they are the Chariot of the Lord &amp; as those were in the most holy place so  Ezekiel sees the vision of these entering into the house &amp; God speaking <a id="l437"></a>from thence: Son of man the place of my throne Ezek. 43.  And as Ezekiels <a id="l438"></a>had each of them four faces, so I conceive had those in the temple, seing <a id="l439"></a>the cherubins carved on the walls of the temple had each of them two <a id="l440"></a>faces extant, the other two being (as it were) hid within the wall, Ezek <a id="l441"></a>41.18.  There is a difference also between the Cherubins &amp; Apocalyptic <a id="l442"></a>Beasts in their wings.  A Cherubin has four wings to signify the distribution <a id="l443"></a>of the whole Church into four quarters, a beast six to signify the subdivision of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p011r"> &lt;11r&gt; </span>  a greater into six parts.</p>
<p id="par13"><em class="underline">And the four Beasts had each of them six wings about him &amp;</em>  <a id="l444"></a><em class="underline">they were full of eyes within &amp; they rest not day &amp; night saying <a id="l445"></a>Holy, holy, holy Lord God almighty which was &amp; is &amp; is to come.</em> Whence <a id="l446"></a>I gather these Beasts are the same with the Seraphins which appeared <a id="l447"></a>to Isaiah<sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> in a vision like this of the Apocalyps.  For there also the <a id="l448"></a>Lord sate on a throne in the Temple &amp; the Seraphins each with six <a id="l449"></a>wings cryed holy, holy, holy Lord  of hosts.  So then they are noble <a id="l450"></a>enough to represent the four quarters of the Church.  They have each of them six wings, that is in all four &amp; twenty  And these <a id="l451"></a>are the four &amp; twenty stations of the people of Israel answering <a id="l452"></a>the four and twenty courses of the Priests.  For <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n16-ref">[16]</sup> because the <a id="l453"></a>morning &amp; evening sacrifices were offered for all the people <a id="l454"></a>&amp; they whose sacrifices were offered were  obliged to be present <a id="l455"></a>in the temple, the people had their representatives distinguished <a id="l456"></a>into four &amp; twenty stations or courses to attend each their week <a id="l457"></a>in order &amp; each station had its President calld the President of the <a id="l458"></a>station.  Further to signify that these Beasts have internall <a id="l459"></a>intellectual eyes tis said that they have eyes within, that is in their bodies <a id="l460"></a>under their wings. / <em class="underline">And they rest not day &amp; night</em> [that is morning <a id="l461"></a>&amp; evening at the sacrifices,] <em class="underline">saying Holy, holy, holy Lord God almighty.  <a id="l462"></a>And when they give glory to him that sitteth upon the throne the <a id="l463"></a>four &amp; twenty elders fall down &amp; worship him.</em>  At the morning <a id="l464"></a>&amp; evening sacrifices so soon as the sacrifice was laid upon the Altar, <a id="l465"></a>&amp; the drink offering began to be poured out the trumpets sounded <a id="l466"></a>&amp; the Levites sang by courses three times, &amp; every time the trumpets <a id="l467"></a>sounded the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n17-ref">[17]</sup> people fell down &amp; worshiped.  Three times therefore <a id="l468"></a>did the people worship; to express which number the Beasts cry <a id="l469"></a>holy, holy, holy; &amp; the song being ended the people prayed standing <a id="l470"></a>till the solemnity was ended.   In the meane time the ✝<sup class="note" id="n18-ref">[18]</sup> Priests went <a id="l471"></a>into the Temple &amp; there fell down before him that sat on <a id="l472"></a>the Throne &amp; worshipped.</p>

<h2 id="hd6" class="cent">Sect III. .  The evening sacrifice.</h2>
<p id="par14">And the Prophet <em class="underline">saw in the right hand of him that sat <a id="l473"></a>upon the Throne a Book written within &amp; on the backside &amp; <a id="l474"></a>sealed with seven seales.</em>  This was the book of the Law <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup> which was <a id="l475"></a>layd up in the most holy place that the <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup>  right side or south side of the Ark &amp; <a id="l476"></a>so was placed, as it were, in the right hand of him that sat between <a id="l477"></a>the cherubins.  The Book of the Law the Iews distinguish into Secti<a id="l478"></a>ons &amp; call some of these sections open others shut up, meaning <a id="l479"></a>that some are intelligible others mysterious &amp; scarce to be under<a id="l480"></a>stood before the day of the Messias.  So the last section of Genesis <a id="l481"></a>wherein Iacob in blessing his sons, predicts the actions captivities &amp; <a id="l482"></a>returns of their posterity &amp; the coming of Shiloh, they note for <a id="l483"></a>a section shut up.  Whence they had this distinction of sections <a id="l484"></a>I know not nor of what moment it is.  Tis more to our pur<a id="l485"></a>pose that the book of the Law with other prophesies relating to <a id="l486"></a>it, tis considered by the old Prophets  as a book bound up &amp; sealed.  So <a id="l487"></a>Isaiah: <sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> Bind up the testimony, seale the Law among my disciples, <a id="l488"></a>And again: The Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep &amp; hath closed your eyes &amp; the Prophets your Rulers <a id="l489"></a>hath he covered, &amp; the vision of all is become as a book that is sealed  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p012r"> &lt;12r&gt; </span>  which men deliver to one that is learned saying Read this I <a id="l490"></a>pray thee &amp; he saith, I cannot for it is sealed.  So Daniel <sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> whose <a id="l491"></a>visions concern the things prefigured in the Law is bid to shut up the <a id="l492"></a>vision of the Ram &amp; Goat, &amp; again in his last vision wherein the <a id="l493"></a>Angel comes to shew him what is noted in the scripture of truth <a id="l494"></a>he is bid to shut up the words &amp; seale the book.  This book of the <a id="l495"></a>scripture of truth  continuing therefore sealed in the hand of God <a id="l496"></a>that is understood by him alone, &amp; being written within &amp; on the <a id="l497"></a>back side, within by hidden predictions of things to come, on the back side  <a id="l498"></a>by open allusions to things past, the Lamb now comes to receive <a id="l499"></a>&amp; open: whence this Prophesy is called the Revelation of Iesus Christ which God gave unto him, being a Revelation or opening of the scripture  shut up &amp; sealed before.</p>
<p id="par15"><em class="underline">For loe in the midst of the throne of the four beasts <a id="l500"></a>&amp; in the midst of the Elders stood a Lamb as it had been slain.</em> <a id="l501"></a>That is to the Prophet standing at the East gate of the Temple the Lamb appeared in the midst of the throne &amp; of the Beasts &amp; Elders.   For this Lamb  is the  daily sacrifice  &amp; therefore stood at the Altar.  <a id="l505"></a>seven ecclesiastical dynasties or Churches of Asia, &amp; seven eyes <a id="l506"></a>which are their Angels  the seven spirits of God <a id="l507"></a> sent forth into all the earth, that is the <a id="l508"></a>Angels or Presbytery of the seven churches.  For as the Me<a id="l509"></a>tropolis of the Apostacy that woman Babylon represents the <a id="l510"></a>whole apostate church so the seven churches of Asia are <a id="l511"></a>put a type of the true church diffused through the whole earth.  The morning sacrifice was finished before the appearance of this Lamb &amp; therefore 'tis the evening sacrifice.  Christ died at the ninth Iewish hour  which was the time of evening sacrifice &amp; therefore his death is here represented by this sacrifice.</p>
<p id="par16">And he came &amp; took the book out of the right hand of him <a id="l512"></a>that sat upon the throne.  The high Priest in the Fast of <a id="l513"></a>the seventh Month &amp; seven days before as he dressed the Lamps <a id="l514"></a>so he offered the morning &amp; evening sacrifices.  And when he had laid the evening sacrifice upon the Altar he went thence into the temple to burn incense &amp; to worship &amp; also on this day as it were to take  <a id="l515"></a>For the Lamb &amp; high Priest in the Apocalyptick language are one <a id="l516"></a>&amp; the same thing.  Christ the Lamb was also the High Priest, who <a id="l517"></a>(as the Apostle Paul expresseth  it) offered himself.</p>
<p id="par17"><sup class="note" id="n23-ref">[23]</sup> Now it was the custome for the High Priest seven days <a id="l518"></a>before the Fast to continue constantly in the Temple, &amp; not <a id="l519"></a>only to exercise himself in the service of the Temple all these <a id="l520"></a>days but also to study the book of the Law that he might be per<a id="l521"></a>fect in it against the day of expiation wherein the service which <a id="l522"></a>was various &amp; intricate was wholly to be performed by himself <a id="l523"></a>&amp; of which service one part was reading the Law to the people <a id="l524"></a>And to promote his studying it there were certain of the Priests <a id="l525"></a>appointed by the Sanhedrim to be with him these seven days in <a id="l526"></a>one of his chambers in the Temple, &amp; there to discourse with <a id="l527"></a>him about the law &amp; read it to  him &amp; put him in mind of <a id="l528"></a>reading &amp; studying it himself.  And this his opening &amp; reading <a id="l529"></a>the Law these seven days is alluded to in the Lambs <a id="l530"></a>opening the seven seales.  In the time of the second Temple  when there was no Ark in the most Holy, the book of the Temple was laid up in an Ark or chest in some other  place &amp; handed to the High Priest by inferior officers: but how it was taken out of the most holy in the time of the Tabernacle &amp; first Temple I do not find recorded.  By  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p013r"> &lt;13r&gt; </span>  the Law of Moses <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n24-ref">[24]</sup>  it was to be taken thence upon occasions <a id="l536"></a>to copy it for the Kings use &amp; the Iews affirm also it was consulted upon <a id="l537"></a>disputes arising about the reading in any other copies.  When Moses had <a id="l538"></a>wrote it he <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n25-ref">[25]</sup> charged it should be read every seventh year in the Feast <a id="l539"></a>of Tabernacles &amp; then ordered it to be put in the side of the Ark to <a id="l540"></a>be kept there for a witness against them, that is to be taken out &amp; read upon occasions; for without being read it could no t be a witness <a id="l541"></a>And if it was taken out on certain occasions &amp; particularly at the <a id="l542"></a>feast of Tabernacles much more against the day of expiation, that <a id="l543"></a>being the greatest solemnity in all the year &amp; the only time the High <a id="l544"></a>Priest was enjoyned to peruse it.   But  the book  now used was  taken out or whether it was that very book kept in the most Holy, or some copy of it  which the High Priest now used is not much material both being the same book in reality.  It suffices that the High Priest went in now into the Temple to worship before the throne &amp; (either really) or as it were to take the book out of the right hand of God &amp; after the solemnity ended, applied himself to the reading.  Twas the Book of the Temple no question which he used, &amp; I do not find that there were more such books then one.  And if he used the book of the Ark, this was the time for him to go into the most Holy &amp; take it.  For on the day of Expiation, <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n26-ref">[26]</sup> this was the time that he sat in thither to bring out the  golden censer.</p>
<p id="par18"><em class="underline">And when the Lamb had taken the Book the four Beasts &amp; <a id="l552"></a>four &amp; twenty Elders fell down before him having every one of <a id="l553"></a>them harps &amp; golden Vials full of  incense which are<a id="l554"></a>the prayers of Lambs &amp; they sung a new song.</em> When the High Priest having offered the incense came out of the Temple, he poured out the drink offering at the food of the Altar &amp; then the trumpets sounded &amp; the people in the outward cause fell down  &amp; worshipped &amp; the Priests went into the Temple &amp; there fell down before the Throne &amp; worshipped.  The Vials are <a id="l555"></a>the Priest's  who offer incense morning &amp; evening with the prayers of the people &amp; the <a id="l556"></a>Harps are the Levites for the Musick of the Temple now alternately intermixed with the vices of the Trumpets.  Every <a id="l557"></a>Elder hath a Vial &amp; Harp to signify that he consists of both <a id="l558"></a>Priests &amp; Levites.   The evening incense  was joyned with the evening sacrifice <sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n28-ref">[28]</sup> coming in between the <a id="l563"></a>offering of the members of the Lamb &amp; the drink offering as I now said, &amp; therefore it is here <a id="l564"></a>joyned with song.</p>
<p id="par19"><em class="underline">And they sung a new song saying Thou art worthy to take the <a id="l565"></a>book &amp; open the seales thereof.  For thou wast slain &amp; hast ye <a id="l566"></a>deemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred &amp; tongue &amp;  <a id="l567"></a>people &amp; nation &amp; hast made us to our God Kings &amp; Priests &amp; we <a id="l568"></a>shall reign on the earth.</em>  This is the  Temple  song  alternately intermixed with the voices of the Trumpets  at the evening sacrifice.  Tis  called a new one because an act of <a id="l569"></a>worship not payd the Lamb before our redemption: &amp; it plainly shews, <a id="l570"></a>as I said, that these Elders &amp; Beasts are the men redeemed by <a id="l571"></a>Christ out of all nations &amp; consequently that they are the Church <a id="l572"></a>catholick of Christians on Earth represented by the Church of the <a id="l573"></a>Iews worshipping in the Temple.   Tis an Eucharistical song &amp; represents the commemoration of the death of Christ in the Lords supper among Christians.  As the Lamb slain is the daily sacrifice of the Iews so the Lords supper celebrated in this evening worship is the daily sacrifice of Christians.  For anciently it was celebrated not only monthly or weekly but even daily in many places.</p>
<p id="par20"><em class="underline">And I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne <a id="l575"></a>&amp; the Beasts &amp; the Elders &amp; the number of them was ten thousand time <a id="l576"></a>ten thousand &amp; thousands of thousands.</em>  These being so numerous &amp; placed without the Court &amp; superadded to the worshippers at the <a id="l577"></a>morning sacrifice, denote the Gentiles called &amp; superadded to the <a id="l578"></a>Church after the resurrection of Christ.  Falling down &amp; worshipping signifies conversion to the true worship.  First the Beasts &amp; Elders alone fall down &amp; worship with a song, that is the Iews alone are converted &amp; then all the angels or Gentiles, are superadded.  And by the same type is the final conversion of the Iews &amp; Gentiles signified in other  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p014r"> &lt;14r&gt; </span> places of the Apocalyps, chap. 7 &amp; 19.</p>
<p id="par21"><em class="underline">And every creature which is in heaven &amp; on the earth &amp; under <a id="l579"></a>the earth &amp; such as are in the sea &amp; all that are in them &amp;c.</em>  Every <a id="l580"></a>creature was <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n29-ref">[29]</sup> a phrase usual amongst the Iews to signify all men &amp; <a id="l581"></a>chiefly the Gentiles, &amp; heaven &amp; Earth &amp; the sea that is the whole natural <a id="l582"></a>world are put to signify the whole political or Ecclesiastical world.  After <a id="l583"></a> the four Beasts &amp; four &amp; twenty Elders had sung a new song to the <a id="l584"></a>Lamb risen from the dead &amp; then an innumerable multitude of Angels gave glory to him; the whole creation Iews &amp; Gentiles, joyn in giving <a id="l585"></a>glory to God &amp; the Lamb together.  And then the four Beasts say, Amen. <a id="l586"></a>&amp; the four &amp; twenty Elders as at the morning sacrifice conclude the <a id="l587"></a>solemnity by falling down &amp; worshipping him that liveth for ever <a id="l588"></a>&amp; ever.  In the <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n30-ref">[30]</sup> Temple the people never answered Amen, but <a id="l589"></a>said, Blessed be the name of the glory of his kingdome for ever &amp; ever: In the <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n31-ref">[31]</sup> Synagogues &amp; houses instead of this clause they said Amen, <a id="l590"></a>And therefore seeing the Beasts instead of that doxology say Amen <a id="l591"></a>it shews that under the form of worshipping in the Temple the worship <a id="l592"></a>in the Synagogues &amp; houses of Christians is delineated.</p>
<p id="par22">Thus under the type of the Iewish daily worship in the <a id="l593"></a>Temple (hitherto from the beginning of the Apocalyps set down in <a id="l594"></a>order from morning to night is the true Christian preaching &amp; worship delinea<a id="l595"></a>ted the preaching being deciphered in the Epistles or sermons to the seven churches &amp; the worship in the sacrifices doxologies &amp; Hymns to God &amp; Christ for <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> &amp; redemption &amp; in the prayers of the saints represented by the odors which the Beasts &amp; Elders offer in golden Vials..  For as the Beasts &amp; Elders allude to the Iewish Church and <a id="l596"></a>signify the Christian so under the type of the Iewish daily worship <a id="l597"></a>is the Christian delineated.  And hence we may understand that <a id="l598"></a>the blaspheming synagogue of Sathan who say they are Iews <a id="l599"></a>&amp; are not but do lye (apoc 2.9 &amp; 3.9) are a Synagogue or <a id="l600"></a>Church of men who say they are Christians &amp; are not but do lye: a Church Christian in name &amp; outward appearance <a id="l601"></a>but in truth &amp; reality not a Christian but a blasphemous that is <a id="l602"></a>an idolatrous Church of Sathan.  These are the Gentiles in the <a id="l603"></a>outward Court of the Temple (Apoc 11) who by worshipping in that <a id="l604"></a>court, the place where the people of God used to worship, say they are Iews <a id="l605"></a>but do lye.  Twas the designe of this Prophesy to describe &amp; distin<a id="l606"></a>guish from one another the true Church  &amp; the Synagogue of <a id="l607"></a>Satan that the elect by considering these things might emerge out of the universal idolatry of the last times &amp; be saved.  Hitherto we have had the worship of the true Church deli<a id="l608"></a>neated by that of the Iews &amp; hereafter we shall have that of the fals blaspheming Church deciphered by the name of blasphemy <a id="l609"></a>on the Beast &amp; by his blaspheming God &amp; those that dwell in heaven, <a id="l610"></a>by the nations wondring after &amp; worshipping the Beast &amp; his Image, <a id="l611"></a>&amp; receiving his mark &amp; the  number of his name , &amp; by the <a id="l612"></a>Whore riding upon this Beast with the Cup of the wine of spiritual fornica<a id="l613"></a>tion in her hand &amp; that idolatrous name Mystery in her fore <a id="l614"></a>head &amp; committing  spiritual fornication with the Kings of the <a id="l615"></a>earth &amp; making the nations drunk with the wine of her fornica<a id="l616"></a>tion, &amp; by their being termed idolaters &amp; abominable &amp; sorcerers  &amp; by the Angels forbidding the Prophet to worship him The understanding of all which is of so great moment, that it made the <a id="l617"></a>spirit say: blessed is he that readeth &amp; they that hear the words of this Prophesy &amp; keep <a id="l618"></a>those things that are written therein.  He that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith <a id="l619"></a>unto the Churches.  For this name &amp; fals worship  is the daily sacrifice &amp; the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet as shal be here after explained.</p>

<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; text from f 14r resumes &gt; </span>
<p id="par23">The evening sacrifice was offered about three hours or three houres  &amp; an <a id="l622"></a>half after noon.  And now the solemnity of the day being finished <a id="l623"></a>the Lamb opens the first Seale.  For the High Priest now betakes  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p015r"> &lt;15r&gt; </span> himself to the study of the law as was said) &amp; so on for <a id="l624"></a>seven days.  The seales are opened therefore in the evenings <a id="l625"></a>that is in the beginnings of the Iewish days &amp; the seventh seale is opened in the beginning of the day of Expiation.</p>
<p id="par24">We began the Prophesy with the High Priest's entring into the Temple ✝<sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup> <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 15v &gt; </span>We began the  Prophesy with the high Priest's entring into the Temple on the third day of the seventh month to dress the Lamps &amp; receive the book of the Law.  For in describing the worship on the Lords day by allusions to the Iewish daily worship, the morning &amp; evening sacrifices ought to fall on one &amp; the same day.  The Lord's day is the day of the resurrection &amp; the resurrection is here typified by the Lamb's rising as it were from the dead to take the book out of the hand of him that sat upon the Throne &amp; therefore the Lamb's receiving the book &amp; the concomitant worship given to him &amp; the Father together must fall upon the Lords day on which he drest the Lamps &amp; so respect the evening worship of that same day.  Thus it is in delineating the Christian worship by the dayly worship of the Iews.  But in predicting things future by allusions to the seventh month, if regard be no longer had to the  worship on the Lords day, we may set apart the prophesy of the seven Epistles &amp; consider the Prophesy of the Seales &amp; Trumpets by it self as interpreters use to do, &amp; begin it with the first day of the seventh month, wherewith the Iewish civil yeare began.  For the Trumpet which talked with the Prophet in the beginning of this Prophesy &amp; said, <em class="underline">Come up hither &amp; I will shew thee things which must be hereafter</em>,  may allude to the sounding of Trumpets on the first day of the month, thence called the feast of Trumpets.  And if the Lamb be supposed slain on this day whether in the morning sacrifice to which this Trumpet sounds  or in the evening sacrifice thereof &amp; to rise again on the third day when he goes to take the book out of the hand of him who sat upon the throne, the passion &amp; resurrection will be more truly represented &amp; the seventh seale will be opened on the beginning of the feast of expiation as above.  And so far as the passion &amp; resurrection is hereby represented it may have respect also to the Feast of the Passover &amp; even to every Fryday &amp; Lords day in the year.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 15r resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par25">When the visions which follow upon the opening of the first <a id="l626"></a>six seales are described &amp; those of the seventh are to follow, <a id="l627"></a>the Prophet tells first the seale of the Peoples &amp; then the solem<a id="l628"></a>nity performed by the Priests.</p>
<h2 id="hd9" class="cent">The people celebrating the Fast &amp; Feast of Tabernacles.</h2>
<p id="par26">The state of the people he describes in two successive multi<a id="l629"></a>tudes.  First a smaller multitude numbred &amp; sealed out of the <a id="l630"></a>twelve Tribes of Israel, then a numberless multitude with <a id="l631"></a>palmes in their hands crying Salvation (that is in the Hebrew, <a id="l632"></a>Hosanna) to our God.  The first are sealed in the day of <a id="l633"></a>expiation the last cry Hosanna in the following Feast of Ta<a id="l634"></a>bernacles.</p>
<p id="par27">The sealing of the first alludes to that place in Ezekiel <sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup> <a id="l635"></a>where the man cloathed in linnen with a Writers inkhorn by his side is commanded <a id="l636"></a>to go through the midst of Ierusalem &amp; set a mark upon the <a id="l637"></a>foreheads of the men that sigh &amp; cry for all the abominations <a id="l638"></a>done in the midst thereof; &amp; then other six men,  the <a id="l639"></a>Angels of the first six Trumpets, are commanded to slay <a id="l640"></a>those who are not marked, &amp; after them  the man cloathed in linnen, the Angel of the seventh  Trumpet is commanded to scatter over the city coales of fire, a type of the war of that  Trumpet whereby the great city Babylon should be utterly consumed.   Now the men that are <a id="l645"></a>sealed being such as sigh &amp; cry for the wickedness of the <a id="l646"></a>people, their condition suits fully with the day of expiation <a id="l647"></a>or great Fast wherein all Israel were to fast from morn<a id="l648"></a>ing to night &amp; humble &amp; afflict themselves for their sins <a id="l649"></a>under pain of being cut off, &amp; to have an attonement made <a id="l650"></a>them for their sins by the High Priest.  This attonement is <a id="l651"></a>their sealing.  The few who truly lament &amp; mourn for the <a id="l652"></a>sins of the people are numbred &amp; sealed, that is selected &amp; accepted of in the attonement &amp; as it were marked out by <a id="l653"></a>the spirit for God's elect: the rest being omitted as Hypocrites.  <a id="l654"></a>For so the Apostle Paul useth the phrase.<sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup>  In Christ, saith <a id="l655"></a>he, after that ye believed ye were sealed with the spirit of promise.  <a id="l656"></a>And to all this agrees well a passage in Esdras,<sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> where he speaks <a id="l657"></a>first of a number of those that are sealed  as in the Feast of <a id="l658"></a> the Lord,  and then describes a <a id="l659"></a>great people appearing on mount Sion which he could not num<a id="l660"></a>ber, praising God with songs, &amp; having palms in their hands, like <a id="l661"></a>that numberless palm-bearing multitude in the Apocalyps which in <a id="l662"></a>like manner follow the number sealed out of every Tribe.</p>
<p id="par28">In the solemnity of this Fast the attonement for the sins <a id="l663"></a>of the people was made by two Goates, the one Gods lot, the other <a id="l664"></a>reprobate.  One was to be sacrificed a sin offering to God to make an <a id="l665"></a>attonement for the sanctuary &amp; cleanse it from the sins of the  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p016r"> &lt;16r&gt; </span>  people: the other to have the sins of the people confest over <a id="l666"></a>him &amp; put upon his head &amp; so loaden with their sins  to be let go into the Wilderness for an attonement for the <a id="l668"></a>people, that is for a cleansing of them from their sins thus <a id="l669"></a>carried away by this Goat.  The Goates therefore signify the <a id="l670"></a>people, the one the elect, the other the reprobate.  For Beasts <a id="l671"></a>are always put for multitudes.  While the good &amp; bad are together <a id="l672"></a>the people are full of sins &amp; defile the Sanctuary.  By separating <a id="l673"></a>the more sinfull from the Church &amp;  through schisms <a id="l674"></a>&amp; heresies, as it were sending them away from the sanctuary, the <a id="l675"></a>remaining Church becomes more clean; &amp; this Church (the living <a id="l676"></a>Sanctuary of God) is in time of persecution by the sacrificing <a id="l677"></a>of the Martyrs &amp; Confessors attoned for.  This Goate, to signify <a id="l678"></a>that it refers to the times of Christianity was burnt without the <a id="l679"></a>Camp Heb 13.10, 11.  Killing &amp; burning a body of men signifies <a id="l680"></a>the dissolving their body as to its outward government, &amp; making <a id="l681"></a>war upon them by persecution.  Which of the two Goats should <a id="l682"></a>be Gods was determined by lot.  The lots were of gold, one <a id="l683"></a>with the inscription <span class="large"><em class="underline">For God</em></span>, the other with the inscription <a id="l684"></a><span class="large"><em class="underline">For Azazel</em></span>.  Whence they named the Scape Goat Azazel.  <a id="l685"></a>These lots were put into a box &amp; shaken &amp; the High Priest, <a id="l686"></a>one of the Goats being set at his right hand &amp; the other at <a id="l687"></a>his left, put both hiss hands together into the box, took out the Lots &amp; laid the right-hand lot on the head of the left hand Goat.  <a id="l688"></a>To this taking out of the lots &amp; laying them on the heads of <a id="l689"></a>the Goats allude the seale of God &amp; the mark of the Beast <a id="l690"></a>set on the foreheads of their worshippers.  For the seale of God <a id="l691"></a>is called the name of God in their foreheads Apoc 14.1 &amp; the <a id="l692"></a>mark of the Beast is called the name of the Beast Apoc.13 17.  <a id="l693"></a>The selecting &amp; sealing some with Gods seale implies that others at that time, as reprobates, receive the mark of the <a id="l694"></a>Beast.  For those are relatives by way of opposition &amp; so con<a id="l695"></a>temporary.  Lots are cast to signify that God makes the <a id="l696"></a>choice.  The sinfull Lot is sent into the wilderness loaden with <a id="l697"></a>the sins of the people by the flight of the degenerating Woman <a id="l698"></a>thither Apoc 12 &amp; 17, those who do not <a id="l699"></a>worship the Image of the Beast &amp; receive his mark Apoc 13.15, 16 &amp; <a id="l700"></a>consequently have the mark of God in their foreheads) is sacrificed <a id="l701"></a>&amp; burt by the fire of persecution to make an attonement for the sanctuary <a id="l702"></a>Apoc 12.17 &amp; 13.7, 15.</p>
<h2 id="hd10" class="cent">The sacrifices of the Fast &amp; Feast of Tabernacles.</h2>
<p id="par29">The  sealed &amp; palmbearing people being described the <a id="l703"></a>Prophet proceeds next to the solemnity of the Fast &amp; Feasts performed by the <a id="l704"></a>Priests.  <em class="underline">And when</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">the Lamb had opened the seventh Seale <a id="l705"></a>there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.</em>  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p017r"> &lt;17r&gt; </span> The silence denotes the time of offering incense in the morning when the <a id="l706"></a>Lamps were dressed.  For  in the brick of incense the people were always praying in their court without  &amp; <a id="l707"></a>so in silence. <sup class="note" id="n36-ref">[36]</sup>  Whence the incense is here said to be offered with the prayers <a id="l708"></a>of the Saints &amp; in another place called their prayers.  The Angel who <a id="l709"></a>offered it is the High Priest.  For on other days the Priest brought <a id="l710"></a>down fire from the great Altar in a Silver censer &amp; emptied it <a id="l711"></a>into a golden one, &amp; took up the golden one &amp; went into the Temple <a id="l712"></a>with him that was to offer the incense &amp; there gave him the fire.  But <a id="l713"></a>on this day the High Priest himself took fire from the great Altar <a id="l714"></a>in a golden censer &amp; then being come down from the Altar took <a id="l715"></a>incense of one that brought it to him &amp; so went to the golden <a id="l716"></a>Altar.  And according to this latter way 'tis here said that the <em class="underline">Angel <a id="l717"></a>came &amp; stood at the Altar having a golden censer</em> (that is to take <a id="l718"></a>fire from thence) <em class="underline">&amp; there was given him much incense that he <a id="l719"></a>should offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar <a id="l720"></a>which was before the Throne.</em>  The ceremony therefore shews that <a id="l721"></a> the Angel was the High Priest performing the service of the Temple, &amp; that on the day of Expiation.</p>
<p id="par30">And whereas  tis said, There was given the Angel much in<a id="l722"></a>cense &amp; that the smoke ascended up before God out of his hand, <a id="l723"></a> that is out of the censer in his hand: this also seems to point out <a id="l724"></a> the day of Expiation.  For on other days, there was an equall <a id="l725"></a>measure of incense morning &amp; night; on this day there was <a id="l726"></a>an excess for the most Holy.  On other days it being all laid on <a id="l727"></a>the fire upon the golden Altar ascended only from thence, on <a id="l728"></a>this, after it had been offered (with the prayers of the people) <a id="l729"></a>upon that Altar the incense was offered, the Angel took a censer &amp; filled it with fire from the Altar &amp; cast it into the Earth &amp; there were <a id="l730"></a>voices &amp; thunderings &amp; lightnings &amp; an Earthquake.  That <a id="l731"></a>is he cast it down to the Earth from heaven where he was.   <a id="l732"></a>As the holy Temple with all things in it is in this Prophesy <a id="l733"></a>considered as in heaven, The earth is in the prophane region without.  <a id="l734"></a>This was that fire therefore which was taken from the great Altar <a id="l735"></a>&amp; carried out of the Temple &amp; thrown down to burn the Goat <a id="l736"></a>which was the Lords lot.  The High Priest went not thither himself <a id="l737"></a>but did it by his Ministers.  As tis usuall to ascribe to a Prince <a id="l738"></a>what ever he doth by his servants, so here, the High Priest may <a id="l739"></a>be said to do what he doth by the hands of inferior Priests <a id="l740"></a>members of his mysticall body.  While the Goat &amp; a Bullock  offered by the High Priest for himself was burning the High Priest <a id="l741"></a><span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> had the Law  to the People <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> offered a ram for himself &amp; a ram for the people &amp; seven lambs together with  evening sacrifice: And to his voice &amp; the fire of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p018r"> &lt;18r&gt; </span>  Sacrifices &amp; the concomitant song of the Levites allude the voices thundrings &amp; lightnings which followed upon <a id="l742"></a> the casting of the fire to the earth.</p>
<p id="par31">The solemnity of this day being finished the seven Angels which <a id="l743"></a>had the seven Trumpets prepared themselves to sound.  They appeared <a id="l744"></a>all together before when there was silence in heaven for half <a id="l745"></a>an hour that is in the beginning of the solemnity of this day, and <a id="l746"></a>by that appearance shew that  one of the Iewish great days was <a id="l747"></a>then commencing.  For they signify the whole body of the Priests <a id="l748"></a>which never came altogether to the Temple but on solemn days.  <a id="l749"></a>This solemnity being over they prepare for the next which is the <a id="l750"></a>Feasts of Tabernacles.  For as in the Chapter above the Saints <a id="l751"></a>sealed on the Fast are followed by the great multitude with <a id="l752"></a>Palms in their hands crying Hosannah, which solemnity was that <a id="l753"></a>of the Feast of Tabernacles: so here after the Fast, is that <a id="l754"></a>Feast described.  This Feast lasted seven days &amp; consisted <a id="l755"></a>every day of great multitudes of burnt offerings (as you may <a id="l756"></a>see described in Numb. 29) which occasioned an extraordinary <a id="l757"></a>blowing of the Trumpets by the Priests.  And this is signified by the <a id="l758"></a>seven Angels sounding their Trumpets successively.  For seeing <a id="l759"></a>amongst the Iews  none blew Trumpets but Priests, these <a id="l760"></a>Angels must be Priests &amp; so their sounding seven times will fitly <a id="l761"></a>signify the successive soundings  on the seven days; each Angel <a id="l762"></a>being a type of all the Priests who sounded together, according <a id="l763"></a>to the use of prophesy which commonly puts a singular for a <a id="l764"></a>multitude.  That Angels are sometimes put for Priests is plain by  Mal. 2.7 7. &amp; accordingly the ancient Iews delivered that the Angel of the Lord who came to proclaim spake to the People (Iud. 2.1, 4) was Phineas.</p>
<p id="par32">I said that the Prophet in describing the times of the seventh seal <a id="l765"></a>tells first the state of the people &amp; then the solemnity of the Priests, <a id="l766"></a> the first in the sealed servants of God &amp; Palmbearing multitude <a id="l767"></a>&amp; second in the incense &amp; seven Trumpets: whence those two <a id="l768"></a>narrations are of things contemporary.  The servants of God <a id="l769"></a>were sealed in the day of the Fast &amp; that Fast began at the opening of <a id="l770"></a> the seventh seale  &amp; ended before <a id="l771"></a> the Trumpets began to sound being the time of incense between them.  The sacrifices of the seven days of the Feast are types of the slaughters in seven wars to which the trumpets sound; &amp;.  The four winds which hurt the earth &amp; sea <a id="l772"></a>&amp; trees are also four wars &amp; hurt the earth &amp; trees at the sounding of the first <a id="l773"></a>Trumpet to war &amp; the sea at the sounding of the second &amp; so on,  &amp; therefore are the wars of the first four Trumpets.  Whence the Angels of the four <a id="l776"></a>winds are the Angels of the first four Trumpets &amp; by consequence <a id="l777"></a> this first appearance is contemporary to the first appearance of the seven that is to the opening of the seventh seal.   These appear <a id="l778"></a>before the servants of God are sealed &amp; do not hurt the earth &amp; the <a id="l779"></a>sea &amp; trees till they are sealed, &amp; therefore their sealing must fall <a id="l780"></a>in with the time between the opening of the seventh seale &amp; sounding of <a id="l781"></a> the first Trumpet.   The following hosanna of the Palm bearing multitude alluding to  the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p019r"> &lt;19r&gt; </span>  the hosanna of the Iews on the Feast of Tabernacles, must necessarily fall <a id="l784"></a>in withthe times of the Trumpets sounding in that Feast on all the even <a id="l785"></a>even days of the Feast the Iews during their stay in the Temple carried palm branches <a id="l786"></a>in their hands &amp; every day compassed the Altar crying hosanna,  gave <a id="l787"></a><em class="underline">now I beseech thee O Lord, O Lord I beseech thee now send prosperity</em>, &amp; <a id="l788"></a>while they did this the Trumpets sounded.  But the solemnity &amp; acclamations <a id="l789"></a>were greatest on the seventh day, &amp; therefore they called that the great hosan<a id="l790"></a>na.  For on each of the first six days the people compassed the Altar but <a id="l791"></a>once, but on the seventh day they compassed it seven times.  Whether the <a id="l792"></a>Apocalyptick hosanna include the hosannas of all the seven days or be only <a id="l793"></a>palm-bearing multitude  must  end with that of the seventh seale &amp; seven Trumpets, &amp; <a id="l794"></a>so is synchronal to it from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p id="par33">Now considering that in the plague of the fift Trumpet none were hurt but <a id="l795"></a>those who had not the seale of God in their foreheads, &amp; consequently that <a id="l796"></a> the sealed ones continued till then in being; that numbring amongst the <a id="l797"></a>Iews signified fewness, whence <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n37-ref">[37]</sup> they used the phrase  <em class="underline">Men of number</em> <a id="l798"></a>to signify a  few  men, &amp; therefore the numbring of the sealed ones <a id="l799"></a>is a symbol of their fewness; that in being numbred they are but few in <a id="l800"></a>comparison of the innumerable multitude; that they are numbred out of <a id="l801"></a>all the twelve Tribes &amp; therefore signify the <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> true Church &amp; so <a id="l802"></a>leave no place for the innumerable multitude till their times be run <a id="l803"></a>out; that the desolate times of the Church signified by the prophesying of the <a id="l804"></a>two witnesses in sackcloth  continue almost till the seventh Trumpet sounds, <a id="l805"></a>&amp; then the witnesses ascend up to heaven in a cloud, that is in a great <a id="l806"></a>multitude, &amp; at the fall of the tenth part of the great city the Nations are <a id="l807"></a>converted, &amp; at the sounding of the seventh Trumpet become universally <a id="l808"></a>victorious, &amp; that at the numbred Israelites were inconsiderable in respect <a id="l809"></a>of the innumerable multitude, to the first six hosannas were inconsiderable <a id="l810"></a>in respect of the seventh for these reasons I place the numbred Israelites <a id="l811"></a>in the times of the first six hosannas or Trumpets, &amp; the innumerable Palm-bearing <a id="l812"></a>multitude in the time of the seventh only.  There is but one hosanna of <a id="l813"></a>this multitude described in the Apocalyps, &amp; that was at the time of their <a id="l814"></a>coming out of the great tribulation &amp; no  doubt the greatest hosanna of the seven is hereby alluded unto  The compassing of the Altar once every day with palm branches <a id="l816"></a>&amp; Trumpets for six days, &amp; then seven times on the seventh day was <a id="l817"></a>done in memory of the like compassing of Iericho with Trumpets in order <a id="l818"></a>to its taking (Iosh 6 as is the Iews tradition &amp; therefore it is a symbol of victory &amp; triumph: whence they were to keep this solemnity with great rejoycing  Levit 23.4. Deut 16.14, 15.  Nehem 8.15, 17 &amp; the  Iews upon victories rejoyced with Palm branches in their hand 1 Mac. 13.51. Iud <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span>.  The compassing  Iericho the first <a id="l819"></a>six days was but preparatory to its taking, on the seventh day they became <a id="l820"></a>victorious &amp; took it with a great shout, &amp; in like manner in the Apocalyps <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p020r"> &lt;20r&gt; </span> at the great hosanna of the seventh Trumpet the Church becomes univer<a id="l821"></a>sally victorious &amp; triumphant with great joy .  The fist six hosannas being but <a id="l823"></a>preparatory to the victory which was to happen at the last &amp; greatest, it <a id="l824"></a>was sufficient in typifying that victory to mention the last alone .  Iericho was taken at the very entrance of Israel into the <a id="l826"></a>land of Canaan, &amp; therefore the  hosannas kept in memory of <a id="l827"></a> the victory against it is a type of the future victory of the Church at her <a id="l828"></a>entrance into the promised land, &amp; this victory happens at the sounding of <a id="l829"></a> the seventh Trumpet when the Kingdoms of this world become the Kingdoms <a id="l830"></a>of Christ &amp; he from thenceforth reigns for ever &amp; ever.  The palm bear<a id="l831"></a>ing multitude after their coming out of the tribulation does hunger no <a id="l832"></a>more nor thirst any more, but the Lamb feeds them &amp; leads them into <a id="l833"></a>living fountains of water, &amp; God dwells among them &amp; wipes away all tears from their eyes which cannot be said of the Church before the last days, that great day when <a id="l834"></a> the last Trumpet sounds &amp; puts an end to time, &amp; the great mystery of God is finished &amp; the dead are judged &amp; the saints rewarded, Apoc. 10.6, 7 &amp; <a id="l835"></a>11.18. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 19v &gt; </span>For the Church continues till <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> condition, but then the tabernacle of God begins to be with men &amp; he dwells with them &amp; wipes away all tears from their eyes &amp; gives unto him that is a thirst the fountain of  water of life freely &amp; feeds them with the tree of life &amp; there is no more hurt. Apoc 21.3, 4, 6 &amp; 22.2, 3.    The description of this  multitude coming  out of the great Tribulation respects most plainly that place of Isaiah ch 49.10 where tis said that the Prisoners that go forth, &amp; they that were in darkness  shal  shew themselves <em class="underline">&amp; they shal no more hunger nor thirst neither shal the heat nor sun smite them for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them</em>  And this is there conjoined with the return of the Iews from captivity.  When they  return from captivity &amp; the dead are raised then doth God wipe away tears from off all faces &amp; take away the rebuke of his people from off the earth Isa 25.8 &amp; then also do the saints come out of the greatest of all tribulations Dan. 12.2, 3.  For  immediately after this tribulation, the kingdoms of the world fall &amp; Christ comes in the clouds to judgment Matt 24.  The souls under the Altar  slain  at the opening of the fift seal were to rest a little season until their fellow servants should be killed as they were &amp; God should at once avenge the blood of all his martyrs on them that dwell on the earth, that is until the end of the great tribulation &amp; therefore when they rise again &amp; God avenges their blood, the Palm-bearing multitude come out of that tribulation.  And this is at the sounding of the seventh Trumpet when the  kingdoms of this world being vanquished become the Kingdoms of Christ &amp; the time of the dead is come that they should be judged &amp; God rewards the saints &amp; destroys them that destroyed the earth.   A little season in the language of this Prophesy where days are put for years  is a long time in the language of the vulgar &amp; so may reach down from the fift seal to the last Trumpet.  So then<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 20r resumes &gt; </span>  So then the sealed  servants of God are the universal <a id="l836"></a>Church militant numbred out of all the 12 Tribes at   the opening of the 4<sup>th</sup> Seal &amp; continue few in number  till <a id="l837"></a> the last Trumpet be ready to sound, &amp; then  the two Witnesses ascending up to heaven in a cloud, they grow to a  great multitude which no man <a id="l838"></a>could number of all Nations &amp; peoples &amp; kindreds &amp; tongues   &amp;  become the <a id="l839"></a>Church triumphant coming out of the great tribulation with palms in their hands &amp; beginning their reign at the great hosanna  of the last Trum<a id="l840"></a>pet when the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of Christ, &amp; <a id="l841"></a>he begins to reign for ever &amp; ever.

<a id="l845"></a><br>The  prophesying in the Fast &amp; Feast of Tabernacles, <a id="l846"></a></h2>
<p id="par34">When six of the Trumpets had sounded &amp; the seventh was ready to <a id="l847"></a>sound the Prophet saw a mighty Angel come down from heaven cloathed <a id="l848"></a>with a cloud &amp; a rainbow was upon his head &amp; his face was as it were the <a id="l849"></a>Sun &amp; his feet as pillars of fire, &amp; he had in his hand a little book open.  <a id="l850"></a>This mighty Angel appearing so glorious above the other Angels with a <a id="l851"></a>rainbow about his head, can be no other but the Son of God.  You may <a id="l852"></a>know him by his face appearing as  the Sun, &amp; his feet as pillars of fire.  <a id="l853"></a>For this was the appearance of the Son of God in the beginning Apoc. 1.<a id="l854"></a>15, 16.  His face was as the Sun to signify that he is a king &amp; his feet as pillars of fire to insinuate that they appeared in the region of the fire of the altar, like pillars burning in the flame of <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> in a fire Apoc. <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span>  He calls the witnesses his witnesses Apoc. 11.3, &amp; they are not the witnesses of any other Angel then Christ.  He had before in the form of <a id="l855"></a>a Lamb opened the Seales of the book that he might read it, &amp; now he comes  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p021r"> &lt;21r&gt; </span> in the form of an Angel with the book opened in his hand to read it.  For a <a id="l856"></a>Lamb to read was improper &amp; therefore he now appears in the form of <a id="l857"></a>a Man.  As the opening of the seventh seale he changed his shape from <a id="l858"></a> the form of a Lamb to that of Angel &amp; stood at the Altar with a gold<a id="l859"></a>en censer inn his hand to do the High Priests office in the day of expiation, <a id="l860"></a>&amp; now that Angel appears again in a more glorious form to do ano<a id="l861"></a>ther part of his office in reading the law to the people on that day.  For <a id="l862"></a> the first appearance of the book open ought to follow immediately <a id="l863"></a> the opening of the last seale, &amp; therefore to fall in with the day of <a id="l864"></a>expiation.  At the times of the Fast &amp; Feast of Tabernacles were <a id="l865"></a>described first by the sealed saints &amp; Palm-bearing multitude, &amp; then again by the solemnity of incense &amp; sounding of the Trumpets, <a id="l866"></a>so they are now described a third time by the reading of the Law <a id="l867"></a>&amp; the ensuing thunders.  Tis usual with Historians when they have <a id="l868"></a>several collateral actions to describe, which cannot be so well told <a id="l869"></a>in order, to describe first one series of things &amp; then another <a id="l870"></a>collateral in time to the former; &amp; the same method is used in <a id="l871"></a>this Prophesy.</p>
<p id="par35"><em class="underline">And he set his right food on the sea</em> [of glass above mentioned] <a id="l872"></a><em class="underline">&amp; his left foot on the earth.</em> Conceive that he is the High Priest and <a id="l873"></a>came down from the throne of heaven where he had be offering <a id="l874"></a>incense &amp; performing other sacred rites on the day of expiation <a id="l875"></a>Chap. 8.3, &amp; came through the east gate of the Priests court into the <a id="l876"></a>Court of the people to read the Law to them while the heifer &amp; that <a id="l877"></a>Goat which was the Lords lots were burnt without the Temple, &amp; that <a id="l878"></a>he stood in the Court without the East gate upon the stairs of the gate <a id="l879"></a>or some other conveniently elevated place to read with his face looking <a id="l880"></a>towards the Prophet &amp; towards the people whilst the Prophet standing <a id="l881"></a>directly before the throne saw him over against the middle of the throne <a id="l882"></a>&amp; both his feet in the region  of the fire of the altar like pillars burning in it,  &amp; the sea of glass behind his right foot.  For, it is to be conceived that <a id="l883"></a> the Prophet stood so as to see the fire of the Altar through the East <a id="l884"></a>gate of the Priests Court like lightning proceeding out of the Throne <a id="l885"></a>Apoc. 4.5, &amp; to have the prospect of the whole Temple before him, <a id="l886"></a>all impediments being removed which make nothing to the purpose of the <a id="l887"></a>Prophesy.  For as he tells us that the lightning proceeded out of the <a id="l888"></a>throne thô it was upon the Altar, &amp; that the singers stood upon the sea of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p022r"> &lt;22r&gt; </span> glass mingled with fire Apoc. 15.2 thô the fire was not upon the sea but <a id="l889"></a>upon the Altar over against the sea, &amp; the singers were neither upon the <a id="l890"></a>sea nor upon the altar but in a right line between him &amp; them at the <a id="l891"></a>East Gate of the Priests Court where they used to sing: so by the same <a id="l892"></a>was of speaking he might tell us also that the Angel stood on the sea with <a id="l893"></a>his right foot &amp; on the earth with his left thô his right foot was only <a id="l894"></a>in a right line between the Prophet &amp; the sea, &amp; only appeared to stand <a id="l895"></a>upon the sea.  For the sea was between the Altar &amp; the Porch &amp; the Temple, <a id="l896"></a>not directly in a right line but verging a little to the south, &amp; so would <a id="l897"></a>appear behind his right foot whilst his left foot stood besides it as it <a id="l898"></a>were upon the earth.  And whilst the Prophet standing eastward saw him <a id="l899"></a>to the west with a rainbow upon his head, suppose in the cloud wherewith he <a id="l900"></a>was cloathed, you may thence learn that the sun was in the east, &amp; consequently <a id="l901"></a>it was in the morning that he first appeared in heaven &amp; began to come <a id="l902"></a>down from thence.  For that was the time that he offered incense on the Golden <a id="l903"></a>Altar &amp; in the most Holy (Apoc. 8.3) &amp; came down from thence to send <a id="l904"></a>away the scape Goat &amp; then to read in the court of the people.</p>
<p id="par36"><em class="underline">And he cryed with a loud voice as when a Lyon roareth</em>, that is <a id="l905"></a>in reading the Law  to the people.  This was the book of Prophesy which the Lamb had <a id="l907"></a>received at the hand of God to open the seales thereof that  he might prophesy out <a id="l908"></a>of it &amp; now having opened all the seales he prophesies out of it to the people, <a id="l909"></a>&amp; this his prophesying is typified by the High Priests' reading in the book of the Law. <a id="l910"></a>For as Christ prophesied in telling the Angel what he had received of God Apoc. <a id="l911"></a>1.1 &amp; 22.6 &amp; 19.10, &amp; the Angel prophesied in shewing Iohn what he had re<a id="l912"></a>ceived of Christ, &amp; Iohn prophesied in telling it to the Churches; so every man who reads or truly interprets any Prophesy to others may be said to <a id="l913"></a>prophesy to them, &amp; therefore the High Priest in reading the Law, whose <a id="l914"></a>ceremonies are prophetical, did prophesy to the people, &amp; that his prophesying <a id="l915"></a>out of it is a proper type of Christ's prophesying out of it to the world by <a id="l916"></a>his mystical body.  For here the mighty Angel represents Christs prophesying to <a id="l917"></a>the people, not in his own person when he sent the prophesy to Iohn, but after<a id="l918"></a>wards in his mystical body when the times of opening the seventh &amp; last seale <a id="l919"></a>commence.</p>
<p id="par37"><em class="underline">And when he had cryed the seven Thunders offered their voices</em>.  These thunders conceive to be the voices of the cloud wherewith the Angel is cloathed that is <a id="l920"></a>of the multitude about them, &amp; so denote the song of the Temple alternately intermixed <a id="l921"></a>with the soundings of the Trumpets at the sacrifices of the seven day s of the Feast of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p023r"> &lt;23r&gt; </span> Tabernacles.  For these thunders speaking articulately so that the Prophet under<a id="l922"></a>stood what they spake they must be humane voices, &amp; we shewed above the <a id="l923"></a>Thunders signify the land voices of a Multitude singing: &amp; as the description <a id="l924"></a>of the dayly sacrifice above was accompanied in the morning with the voice of a Trumpet <a id="l925"></a>Apoc. 4.1, &amp; in the evening with the voice of singing Chap. 5.9, so the description of <a id="l926"></a>the sacrifices of the Feast of Tabernacles is first done by the voices of seven <a id="l927"></a>Trumpets, &amp; then by the voices of seven Thunders representing the song of the Temple <a id="l928"></a>And as in the daily sacrifice the voices of the Trumpets &amp; singers are alternately <a id="l929"></a>intermixed, so it is here.  For Thunder as well as the sound of a Trumpet <a id="l930"></a>signifies war, &amp; therefore the seven Thunders as well as the seven Trumpets <a id="l931"></a>are seven successive wars, &amp; because these wars end together (as is said a little <a id="l932"></a>after) they must be coincident, &amp; so refer to the same sacrifices.</p>
<p id="par38">Yet is there this difference between the voices of Trumpets &amp; the voices of <a id="l933"></a>thunder that the one is prophesying &amp; the other not.  For all praising &amp; glorifying <a id="l934"></a>God is prophesying &amp; such is singing in the Temple.  For so the sons of Asaph &amp; <a id="l935"></a>Heman &amp; Ieduthun who were appointed by David for the song in the house of the Lord <a id="l936"></a>with Cymbals, Psalteries &amp; Harps are said to prophesy with those musical instruments <a id="l937"></a>1 Chron. 25.1, 2, 3, &amp; Heman from having the charge over his sons in these matters <a id="l938"></a>is calls the Kings seer in the works of God to life up the horn vers 5, &amp; so are Asaph <a id="l939"></a>&amp; Ieduthun 2 Chron. 29.30 &amp; 25.15.  So also where Samuel saith to Paul a Choir <a id="l940"></a>of Prophets shal meet thee with a Psaltery, a drum, a pipe &amp; a harp &amp; <em class="underline">they shall <a id="l941"></a>prophesy</em>, the Chaldee interprets it &amp; <em class="underline">they shal sing</em> or <em class="underline">praise</em>: &amp; again 1 Sam. 19.<a id="l942"></a>25, <em class="underline">he went forward singing, he put off his garment &amp; sung</em>.  So for a man <a id="l943"></a>&amp; woman's praying or prophesying in 1 Cor. 11.4, 5 the Apostle seems to put praying or <a id="l944"></a> singing in chap. 14.15.  For a woman is not otherwise to prophesy in the Church then by singing.  So then thundering in the Temple is prophesying and the cloud which  thunders signifies a company of Prophets.  The voices of the Thunders <a id="l945"></a>were articulate &amp; all articulate speaking in this prophesy of the Apocalyps <a id="l946"></a>is a part of the Prophesy.  And since the whole Prophesy is the Prophesy of the Book <a id="l947"></a>which Christ received at the hand of God,  the seven thunders are a prophesying out <a id="l948"></a>of that book.  And of this the song at the sacrifices of this Feast was a fit type, <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup> it <a id="l949"></a>being taken out of the Law.  There is also another type of prophesying in the <a id="l950"></a>times signified by the seven days of this  Feast.  For such is the pouring out of water <a id="l951"></a>in the drink offerings of the morning &amp; evening sacrifices of these seven days, as <a id="l952"></a>the Iews &amp; even Christ himself (in alluding to this pouring out of water) interprets <a id="l953"></a>Iohn 7.37, 38.  A third type is the reading out of the Law by the King to the people in <a id="l954"></a>their Court on these seven days The Angel is both King &amp; Priest &amp; stands all the while with the book open in his hand in a reading posture.  And if the seven thunders comprehend all the <a id="l955"></a>prophetick voices of the seven days, the  voices of the King as well as the voices of the <a id="l956"></a>singers must be comprehended in them.</p>
<p id="par39">When the Thunders had uttered their voices the Prophet is bid to seal them <a id="l957"></a>up &amp; write them not, to signify that although the book of the Law was opened by the Lamb <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p024r"> &lt;24r&gt; </span> &amp; read by the Angel &amp; proclaimed aloud by the prophetick thunders to the people, <a id="l958"></a>yet the whole prophesy is heretofore sealed up in obscurity &amp; needs an interpre<a id="l959"></a>tation to make it intelligible: the book being sealed till the opening of the last seal, <a id="l960"></a>&amp; now the contents of it being sealed anew.  Hitherto therefore the whole <a id="l961"></a>prophesy is a dark obscure ænigma sealed up in difficult types &amp; figures.  In the next words an end is put to this ænigma by declaring that it is brought down to the <a id="l962"></a>end of time, &amp; then follows the interpretation.</p>
<p id="par40">And the Angel sware by him that liveth for ever &amp; ever that there should be time no <a id="l963"></a>longer (that is after the Thunders) but in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel <a id="l964"></a>when he shal begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath de<a id="l965"></a>clared to his servants the Prophets.  This alludes chiefly to the like oath of the same <a id="l966"></a>glorious Angel appearing in the High Priests habit in Daniel, <sup class="note" id="n39-ref">[39]</sup> who in answer to the question <a id="l967"></a>how long it should be to the end of the wonders there prophesied of, held up his hands <a id="l968"></a>to heaven &amp; sware by him that liveth for ever &amp; ever that it shal be for a time time <a id="l969"></a>times &amp; an half, &amp; at the ending of the dispersion of the power of the holy people all these <a id="l970"></a>things shal be ended.  The Thunders seing after them there shall be time no longer, <a id="l971"></a>last to the end of ages, that is of those times called by Daniel a time times &amp; a half: <a id="l972"></a>at the end of which the seventh Trumpet shal sound, &amp; the great mystery of God which the old <a id="l973"></a>Prophets have chiefly spoken be fulfilled: the Iews then returning from captivity <a id="l974"></a>&amp; the greatness of the kingdom under the whole end at the end of those three times <a id="l975"></a>&amp; a half (as Daniel chap. 7 describes) being given to the saints of the most High <a id="l976"></a>whole kingdome is an everlasting kingdom; &amp; the kingdoms of this world at the sounding of that Trumpet (as Iohn tells us) becoming the kingdoms <a id="l977"></a>of our Lord &amp; of his Christ, who shal reign for ever.  The prophesies therefore <a id="l978"></a>of the Thunders is contemporary to that of the Trumpets (as I newly af<a id="l979"></a>firmed) because it ends together with them.</p>
<h2 id="hd12" class="cent">The interpretation of the prophesying <a id="l980"></a>in the Fast &amp; Feast of Tabernacles.</h2>
<p id="par41">The Spirit having under the types of the Law brought down the sealed prophesy to the end of <a id="l981"></a>time, passes on now to give the interpretation of the whole under various allusions to the Iewish <a id="l982"></a>history.  And the voice, saith he, which I heard from heaven (that is the first voice of a Trumpet) spake <a id="l983"></a>to me again &amp; said: Go take the little book that is open in the Angels hand &amp;c.  And I took the little <a id="l984"></a>book out of the Angels hand &amp; ate it up, &amp; it was in my mouth sweet as honey, &amp; as soon <a id="l985"></a>as I had eaten it my belly was bitter.  And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again, <a id="l986"></a>before many peoples &amp; Nations &amp; tongues &amp; Kings.<sup class="note" id="n40-ref">[40]</sup>  This is an introduction to a new prophesy and a repetition of all the former, &amp; alludes to Ezekiels being sent to the wicket Iews to prophesy <a id="l987"></a>by eating a book spread open, &amp; written within &amp; without, &amp; full of lamentations &amp; wo, but sweet in his <a id="l988"></a>mouth.  Eating &amp; drinking signify acquiring.  For so eating flesh is put for acquiring riches <a id="l989"></a>Dan. 7.5, 23.  Eating Christs flesh &amp; drinking his blood is beleiving on him &amp; receiving his <a id="l990"></a>doctrine Ioh. 6.  &amp; the leaven of the Pharisees is their doctrine Matt 16 12 eating the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledg is acquiring knowledge by doing something interdicted Gen. 3.5, 7.  The tree of life &amp; water of life are wisdome &amp; understanding Prov 3.18 &amp;  13.14 &amp; 15.4 &amp; 14.27 &amp; 16.28.  Drinking the water of life is receiving the spirit Iohn. 7.39, &amp; so  <a id="l991"></a>eating the book is becoming inspired with the prophesy conteined in it, &amp; is a type of his prophesying <a id="l992"></a>out of it.  How the book in his hand may signify his prophesying out of it needs no explication, but how he <a id="l993"></a>should speak out of his belly may seem something strange, &amp; yet was it a  phrase used by the eastern Na<a id="l994"></a>tions.  So Iob,<sup class="note" id="n41-ref">[41]</sup> I am full of words, the spirit of my belly constraineth me: Behold my belly is as <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p025r"> &lt;25r&gt; </span> is as wine which hath no vent, it is ready to burst like new bottles.  And Solo<a id="l995"></a>mon:<sup class="note" id="n42-ref">[42]</sup> It is a pleasant thing if thou keep the words of the wise in thy belly; <a id="l996"></a>they shall withall be fitted in thy lips.  And Christ:<sup class="note" id="n43-ref">[43]</sup> If any Man thirst let <a id="l997"></a>him come unto Me &amp; drink: He that beleiveth on me, out of his belly shall <a id="l998"></a>flow rivers of living water, that is words of life by vertue of the spirit which his disciples <a id="l999"></a>were to receive.  The Prophet ate the  open book &amp; therefore is to pro<a id="l1000"></a>phesy again of the   times which to come it being opened &amp; by consequence the ensuing prophesy of the measure Temple &amp; two Witnesses commences with the opening of the last seal.   It was was sweet in his <a id="l1003"></a> mouth &amp; bitter in his belly, to denote the bitter state of the Church after the Gentiles should begin to tread under foot the holy City.    <a id="l1005"></a></p>

<p id="par42"> Now because the Prophesy of the seales &amp; Trumpets respected the worship in the Temple this prophesying again begins with a new Temple.  That respected either the  tabernacle or first temple  as you may know by the throne or Ark withing it &amp; by the four beasts or twelve <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p026r"> &lt;26r&gt; </span>  tribes about it &amp; by the sealing the servants of God out of all the tribes there being in the second Temple no Ark nor any more tribes then two: this begins with the building of the second Temple, as you understand by the following history of this Temple.  The Iews at their return from captivity were <a id="l1035"></a>but few &amp; poor &amp; so needed not all the great court which was before built <a id="l1036"></a>by Solomon for the whole nation in prosperity, nor were able to rebuild <a id="l1037"></a>it.  Cyrus his decree was only for the Temple to be built with three rows <a id="l1038"></a>of stone &amp; a row of cedar becaus Ezra 6.4, that is for the Temple with <a id="l1039"></a>the inner Court 1 Kings 6.36.  And instead of the great Court there was <a id="l1040"></a>walled in at the east end of the inner Court, a little court for the <a id="l1041"></a>people which they called the weomans Court to distinguish it from the Eastern <a id="l1042"></a>border of the inner Court which border was called the court of Israel.  For <a id="l1043"></a>into this border Men alone, into the other Court weomen as well as <a id="l1044"></a>men were admitted.  And the littleness of this Court compared with the former great one was the cause that they who had seen the former Temple wept when they saw the foundation of this new one laid Ezra 3.12, &amp; <a id="l1045"></a>that Haggai asked them <em class="underline">Who is left amongst you that saw this house in <a id="l1046"></a>her first glory &amp; how do you see it now?  Is it not in your eyes in com<a id="l1047"></a>parison of it as nothing?</em>  Haggai 2.3.</p>
<p id="par43">In this state continued this Temple till the time of the Greek <a id="l1048"></a>Empire when Simeon Iustus the High Priest repaired the House &amp; built from the foun<a id="l1049"></a>dation the perimeter of the outward Court, being a high double building <a id="l1050"></a>(Eccles. 5.1, 2) that is with double Cloysters and double chambers over <a id="l1051"></a>them parted by a row of pillars below between the Cloysters &amp; a wall <a id="l1052"></a>above between the Chambers.  This building continued till Herods <a id="l1053"></a>time who rebuilt part of it more splendidly: but yet the custome <a id="l1054"></a>which had long confirmed the weomens Court to the Iews &amp; given away <a id="l1055"></a>the ground of the great Court to the Gentiles, remained as before: so <a id="l1056"></a>that the great Court which before the Captivity was the peoples was now accounted <a id="l1057"></a>the Gentiles, &amp; the people continued to use only the weomen's Court &amp; East<a id="l1058"></a>ern border of the Priests: Whence God in Ezekiel's vision of the Temple complains prophetically that they had admitted strangers &amp; Men uncircum<a id="l1059"></a>cised into his Temple &amp; tells them that this shall be the Law of the house: <a id="l1060"></a><em class="underline">Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall <a id="l1061"></a>be most holy</em>, And makes the wall round about the four sides of the <a id="l1062"></a>outward Court, to separate between the sanctuary &amp; the prophane place, <a id="l1063"></a>&amp; places the people in the outward Court, &amp; charges that no stranger un<a id="l1064"></a>circumcised in flesh be admitted into his Sanctuary Ezek. 44.7, 9, 19 &amp; <a id="l1065"></a>42.20 &amp; 43.12.  Where it is to be noted that Ezekiels outward Court <a id="l1066"></a>answers in dimensions to the Gentiles Court; each side being 500 cubits <a id="l1067"></a>long, viz. fifty from the outward face to the inward face of each gate <a id="l1068"></a>of the outward Court, 100 from thence to the outward face of the gate   <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p027r"> &lt;27r&gt; </span>  of the inward Court, fitly from thence to the inward face of the same gate, <a id="l1069"></a>&amp; fifty from thence to the center of the inward Court; all which doubled make <a id="l1070"></a>500 cubits (Ezek 40) by mistake in some versions called reeds Ezek. 42.</p>
<p id="par44">Now to this history &amp; constitution of the Temple (though not un<a id="l1071"></a>derstood by the Iews &amp; Christians of those ages) alludes the divine A<a id="l1072"></a>pocalyps.  The Temple &amp; Altar &amp; they that worship therein, being <a id="l1073"></a>here opposed to the outward court, do signify the Courts of the Temple &amp; <a id="l1074"></a>Altar with their buildings &amp; the peoples court called the court of the weo<a id="l1075"></a>men.  For by the Temple the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n44-ref">[44]</sup> Iews frequently understood Zerubbabels <a id="l1076"></a>Temple alone, that is all the buildings belonging to the inward Court where<a id="l1077"></a>in they had worshipped from Zerubbabels time.  The outward Court they <a id="l1078"></a>called the mountain of the house.  And hence 'tis called here the Court <a id="l1079"></a>without the Temple.  The inward building therefore the Prophet is com<a id="l1080"></a>manded to measure, that is to build &amp;, let the outward lye wast.  For because <a id="l1081"></a>builders first sett out the measures of what they build, therefore mea<a id="l1082"></a>suring is used as a type of building.  So Ezekiel to signify that the Temple <a id="l1083"></a>delineated by him should be built, measures every part thereof with <a id="l1084"></a>a reed.  So the Angel for the like reason measures the new Ierusalem <a id="l1085"></a>in the Apocalyps.  And so Zachary sees an Angel with a measuring line <a id="l1086"></a>going to measure Ierusalem, &amp; another Angel tells him that Ierusalem <a id="l1087"></a>should be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men &amp; <a id="l1088"></a>cattel therein Zech. 2.  And so Ieremy (chap. 21.20) describes building <a id="l1089"></a>by measuring.  The command therefore to measure the Temple &amp; Altar <a id="l1090"></a>&amp; them that dwell therein (that is their Courts) &amp; to leave the outward court <a id="l1091"></a>unmeasured alludes to Ezekiel's measuring the Temple in the Babylonian <a id="l1092"></a>captivity, &amp; to Zerubbabels rebuilding the inward part of that Temple <a id="l1093"></a>while the outward court was left out &amp; remained unbuilt &amp; open to the <a id="l1094"></a>Gentiles.  And whilst the prophesy has hitherto respected the worship <a id="l1095"></a>of the Temple, this building of a new Temple is a plain indication that <a id="l1096"></a>Iohn here begins by vertue of the eaten book to prophesy again.</p>
<p id="par45">Now this prophesy of the Second Temple respects that same anniversary <a id="l1097"></a> solemnity of the seventh month which was before described in the times <a id="l1098"></a>of the first Temple.  For it ends with the first day of the month, <a id="l1099"></a>but respects only the solemnity of the seventh seale, For 'tis an interpre<a id="l1100"></a>tation of the prophesy of the vision &amp; voices of the Angel &amp; thunders imme<a id="l1101"></a>diately preceding it, &amp; that prophesy being the prophesy of the little book <a id="l1102"></a>opened in the Angels hand commences with the opening of the last seale thereof <a id="l1103"></a>&amp; so respects the times of the Fast &amp; Feast of Tabernacles as was explained <a id="l1104"></a>above.  The prophesy of the second Temple commences therefore with the opening <a id="l1105"></a>of the seventh seale.  The building of a new Temple signifies the building of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p028r"> &lt;28r&gt; </span>   Church anew or in a new state &amp; by consequence implies her fall from <a id="l1106"></a>her first condition.  And to this answers the descent of the mighty Angel from <a id="l1107"></a>heaven with the little book open in his hand.  For all ascent &amp; descent sig<a id="l1108"></a>nifies the exaltation &amp; depression of the thing ascending &amp; descending <a id="l1109"></a>&amp; the mystical body of this Angel together with the thundering cloud where<a id="l1110"></a>with he is cloathed is the Church.</p>
<p id="par46">And that this is so will more fully appeare by comparing the mea<a id="l1111"></a>suring of this Temple &amp; them that worship therein with the numbring &amp; seal<a id="l1112"></a>ing the servants of God.  For this Temple being not wood &amp; stone but <a id="l1113"></a>the living Church of God, the measuring of it &amp; them that worship therein &amp; <a id="l1114"></a>leaving out the outward Court of unholy Gentiles unmeasured, is a <a id="l1115"></a>type of the same kind with numbring &amp; sealing the servants of God out <a id="l1116"></a>of all Israel &amp; leaving the rest unsealed, &amp; signifies the very same thing.  <a id="l1117"></a>For as that signifies the selecting of a few to be a holy people to God, <a id="l1118"></a>while the multitude are rejected: so this signifies the building up the <a id="l1119"></a>Elect a spiritual house an holy Priesthood to offer up sacrifices to God <a id="l1120"></a>by Iesus Christ (as Peter expresses it)<sup class="note" id="n45-ref">[45]</sup> while the outward Court of <a id="l1121"></a>unholy nations lies spiritually unbuilt.  These therefore are but se<a id="l1122"></a>veral types of one &amp; the same thing, &amp; by consequence this measuring <a id="l1123"></a>begins at the same time with the numbring &amp; sealing, that is presently <a id="l1124"></a>after the opening of the seventh seale; &amp; they who worship in the mea<a id="l1125"></a>sured Temple are the same with those saints whose prayers the Angel in <a id="l1126"></a>the solemnity of the Temple worship presently after the opening of that <a id="l1127"></a>seal offers with much incense upon the golden Altar.  The sealing of <a id="l1128"></a>the servants of God alludes to Ezekiels vision of sealing or marking <a id="l1129"></a>the best of the people in the commencing Babylonian captivity to be <a id="l1130"></a>preserved &amp; continue the remnant of Gods Church in the times of the <a id="l1131"></a>second Temple.  And therefore the sealed lived in the times of that Temple, <a id="l1132"></a>&amp; their sealing as well as the measuring of that Temple commences at the Ba<a id="l1133"></a>bylonian captivity.  For seing the Church never ceases but is built up in <a id="l1134"></a>a new form &amp; seale so soon as demolished in an old one, the interval <a id="l1135"></a>between the fall of the first Temple &amp; building of the second is not here to be considered.</p>
<p id="par47">There are therefore four contemporary prophesies, the first begins <a id="l1136"></a>with the four Angels holding the four winds, the second with the mea<a id="l1137"></a>suring of the Temple.  For as they begin together, so we have already <a id="l1138"></a>proved that they end all together at the sounding of the seventh Trumpet.  <a id="l1139"></a>The three first are descriptions of contemporary things done in one &amp; the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p029r"> &lt;29r&gt; </span>  same Fast &amp; Feast of Tabernacles, the fourth is an interpretation of those <a id="l1140"></a>three &amp; more especially of the third.  For as this was most hidden &amp; there<a id="l1141"></a>fore most needed an interpretation, so it has most affinity with the fourth.  <a id="l1142"></a>For the prophesies of the seven Thunders &amp; two witnesses are the prophesy <a id="l1143"></a>of one &amp; the same Angel standing all the while with his right foot upon the <a id="l1144"></a>sea &amp; his left upon the left, &amp; of one &amp; the same opened book first held in <a id="l1145"></a>the Angels hand to prophesy, &amp; then eaten by the Prophet to prophesy again, <a id="l1146"></a>&amp; they are put also together between the sixt &amp; seventh Trumpets after <a id="l1147"></a>the manner of a sentence within a parenthesis, &amp; therefore like two <a id="l1148"></a>clauses of such a sentence, have a particular relation of one to another.  <a id="l1149"></a>&amp; seing the first is a prophesy sealed up, &amp; the second a prophesying again out <a id="l1150"></a>of the same book by way of interpretation, the relation which they have one <a id="l1151"></a>to another must be this that the second is an interpretation of the first.  And <a id="l1152"></a>for this reason 'tis that the interpretation begins no higher then with the <a id="l1153"></a>times of the seventh seale.  The first of these two prophesies begins with the same book newly <a id="l1154"></a>eaten to prophesy again out of it; the fist is a prophesy of reading out of <a id="l1155"></a>that book, the second a prophesy of that book in the Prophets mouth a fit type <a id="l1156"></a>of reading; in the very beginning of the first the Angel came down &amp; stood upon <a id="l1157"></a>the earth &amp; sea, in the very beginning of the second the Angel stood again in the same posture: <em class="underline">And the Angel stood &amp; Said Arise &amp; measure the Temple of <a id="l1158"></a>God</em> &amp;c.  The Angel did not go to Iohn to give him the book, but Iohn <a id="l1159"></a>went to the Angel to take it.  He kept his place, &amp; when Iohn had eaten <a id="l1160"></a>the book, stood up as at first &amp; began to prophesy anew.</p>
<p id="par48">The persons prophesying are the two witnesses.  For in those his witnesses <a id="l1161"></a>doth the mighty Angel (our High Priest &amp; King) perpetually prophesy.  And they <a id="l1162"></a>in being called two olive trees allude to the two olive trees or anointed ones in <a id="l1163"></a>Zachary Chap. 4, that is to Zerubbabel &amp; Ishua the Prince &amp; High Priest who <a id="l1164"></a>read the law, &amp; in their having power over the waters to turn them to blood, &amp; to <a id="l1165"></a>smile the earth with a curse as oft as they will, they allude also to Moses and <a id="l1166"></a>Aaron the Prince &amp; High Priest who taught the people the Law in the beginning.  <a id="l1167"></a>Yet are not these witnesses single persons but (like all other persons in the <a id="l1168"></a>Apocalyps) have their mystical bodies.  The mighty Angel (our High Priest &amp; <a id="l1169"></a>King) begin Christ has his mystical body &amp; is cloathed with a cloud of Prophets, &amp; all <a id="l1170"></a>these compose the two witnesses.  For they are called the two Candlesticks &amp; two olive <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p030r"> &lt;30r&gt; </span> trees &amp; therefore are two Churches.  For Candlesticks are Churches Apoc. 1.70 &amp; <a id="l1171"></a>so are olive trees Ier. 11.16, Rom. 11.17, 24.  And in being Churches they are the <a id="l1172"></a>mystical body of that Angel distinguished into two Churches by the double pro<a id="l1173"></a>phetical person he bears of Priest &amp; King &amp; by his two leggs.  For the circum<a id="l1174"></a>stance of setting his two feet upon the earth &amp; sea is not insignificant, &amp; if <a id="l1175"></a>it signify any thing his feet must signify some thing, &amp; what they signify <a id="l1176"></a>may be learnt from Nebuchadnezzar's Image.  For as the two leggs of that <a id="l1177"></a>Image were put to signify the twofold kingdoms of the last times the Greek &amp; <a id="l1178"></a>Latine Empires, so Christ's mystical body being the Churches his two leggs must <a id="l1179"></a>signify the twofold Church of the last times, that is the churches of the earth &amp; sea <a id="l1180"></a>upon which the Angel stands with the book of the Law open in his hand to prophesy, or <a id="l1181"></a>the Churches diffused through that earth &amp; sea to whose inhabitants the Devil <a id="l1182"></a>came down with great wrath Apoc. 12.  The descent from heaven of the Angel <a id="l1183"></a>cloathed with a cloud &amp; the ascent of the two witnesses to heaven in a cloud are <a id="l1184"></a>evidently relatives by way of opposition &amp; signify the fall &amp; rise of the Church or <a id="l1185"></a>beginning &amp; ending of her law &amp; afflicted condition.  For the prophesy of the two <a id="l1186"></a>Churches whereby she is represented during that condition begins with the first &amp; ends <a id="l1187"></a>with the last.  In the representation of these two Churches by the Angel their original is <a id="l1188"></a>described but not their end; for 'tis not said what became of that Angel, &amp; in the <a id="l1189"></a>representation of the same Churches by the two witnesses their end is described <a id="l1190"></a>but not their beginning; for 'tis not said whence those two witnesses were.  <a id="l1191"></a>Both prophesies apart are incomplete &amp; must be conjoyned to make the <a id="l1192"></a>description of the two Churches entire &amp; perfect.  These are the persons pro<a id="l1193"></a>phesying &amp; they prophesy by teaching &amp; interpreting the apostolick scriptures.  <a id="l1194"></a>προφητεύειν to prophesy signifies not only to predict &amp; foretell but also <a id="l1195"></a>to interpret things difficult which relate to religion as you may see in the <a id="l1196"></a>Lexicographers.  So Achiors religious discourse is called prophesying Iu<a id="l1197"></a>deth 6.2, &amp; the Apostle call the Poet Epimenides a Prophet Tit. 1.12 &amp; in <a id="l1198"></a>general he calls expounding the scriptures prophesying 1 Cor. 14 &amp; Rom. 12.6.  So Plu<a id="l1199"></a>tarch in his book of the defection of Oracles &amp; Plato in his Timæus &amp; Festus <a id="l1200"></a>use the word prophesying for interpreting of Oracles &amp; others use it for <a id="l1201"></a>interpreting of dreams.</p>
<p id="par49">The people in the outward court to whom the mighty Angel prophesies are <a id="l1202"></a>here called the Gentiles or Nations to whom that Court is given.  These tread <a id="l1203"></a>under foot the holy city &amp; therefore are enemies to the Church.  And since <a id="l1204"></a>the Temple is the scene of all the visions, the outward court with the Nation therein <a id="l1205"></a>&amp; the earth &amp; sea, on which the Angel stands to prophesy to them must repre<a id="l1206"></a>sent all the regions of the Nations of the whole earth &amp; sea prophesied <a id="l1207"></a>against in this book.  These are they that dwell upon earth whom <a id="l1208"></a>the two witnesses tormented by their prophesying &amp; who therefore rejoyced <a id="l1209"></a>at their death.  They of the peoples &amp; kindreds &amp; tongues &amp; Nations who see their dead <a id="l1210"></a>bodies three days &amp; an half, the people of the great city in whose streets they are slain <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p031r"> &lt;31r&gt; </span> &amp; lye dead, the many peoples, &amp; Nations, &amp; tongues &amp; Kings before whom the Prophet <a id="l1211"></a>is sent to prophesy again.  For he prophesies in the two witnesses to those <a id="l1212"></a>Nations.  The place is either the streets of the great city, that is its dition &amp; <a id="l1213"></a>provinces, or the outward court of the Temple.  In respect of the Angel's stand<a id="l1214"></a>ing upon the earth &amp; sea to read the Law in all places (as well in the synagogues <a id="l1215"></a>as in the Temple) the two witnesses prophesy in the streets of the great city.  <a id="l1216"></a>In respect of Laws being read in the Temple the Nations are placed in the outward court.  For it was read in the court of the people, &amp; that court <a id="l1217"></a>was the outward court in Solomon's Temple.</p>
<p id="par50">The seven Thunders are not only the articulate voices of reading &amp; <a id="l1218"></a>prophesying, but also signify wars, namely those to which the Trumpets sound, <a id="l1219"></a>&amp; those wars are described in the prophesy of the two witnesses by fire <a id="l1220"></a>proceeding out of their mouths.  Thunder fire &amp; blowing of Trum<a id="l1221"></a>pets are all of them types of war; &amp; the war represented by all these <a id="l1222"></a>is of one &amp; the same kind.  For it is occasioned by the loud cry of the op<a id="l1223"></a>pressed Church, &amp; is inflicted upon her enemies.  For as the fire proceeds <a id="l1224"></a>out of the mouth of the two witnesses or Churches, so the Thunders are the <a id="l1225"></a>voices of the cloud wherewith the Angel or Church is cloathed, &amp; the <a id="l1226"></a>Trumpets are blown by the seven Angels of the seven <a id="l1227"></a>Churches, their mystical bodies are those Churches.  The seven Angels, <a id="l1228"></a>the cloud, &amp; the two witnesses are all of then types of the same prophetick <a id="l1229"></a>people, &amp; do all of them send out of their mouths the symbols of the wars.  <a id="l1230"></a>Tis in answer to the two first that the fire comes out of the mouth of the last.  <a id="l1231"></a>In the prophesy of the seales &amp; Trumpets where Christ is represented <a id="l1232"></a>by  Lamb with seven horns &amp; seven eyes which are the seven <a id="l1233"></a>spirits of God or seven Angels, his mystical body the Church is repre<a id="l1234"></a>sented sevenfold by those seven Angels sounding the Trumpets.  In the <a id="l1235"></a>prophesy of the open book where he is represented by a mighty Angel stand<a id="l1236"></a>ing with his right foot on the sea &amp; his left foot on the earth, his mystical <a id="l1237"></a>body in respect of his two eyes &amp; two feet is represented (as we said) by <a id="l1238"></a>two witnesses.  In both cases Christ is the same &amp; his mystical body the <a id="l1239"></a>Church is the same, thô in several respects represented by several num<a id="l1240"></a>bers.  In what respect this Church is represented sevenfold &amp; in what two <a id="l1241"></a>fold shal be explained hereafter.  This Church thunder &amp; breaths out <a id="l1242"></a>fire &amp; blows the Trumpets to these wars not by faction &amp; sedition but by calling <a id="l1243"></a>for the divine vengeance upon her persecutors in such a manner the soules of <a id="l1244"></a>the Martyrs under the Altar cryed out with a loud voice <em class="underline">How long O Lord holy &amp; true dost thou not judge &amp; avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth Apoc. <a id="l1245"></a>6.10.  For if any Man will hurt the witnesses fire proceeds out of their Mouth</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p032r"> &lt;32r&gt; </span>  <em class="underline">&amp; devoureth their enemies, &amp; if any man will hurt them he must in this man<a id="l1246"></a>ner be killed</em>, that is as oft as they are hurt by their persecuting enemies <a id="l1247"></a>their blood crys out for vengeance.  <em class="underline">For he that leadeth into captivity must <a id="l1248"></a>go into captivity, &amp; he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword <a id="l1249"></a>here is the patience of the faith of the saints</em> Apoc. 13.10.</p>
<p id="par51">I have here considered the fire which comes out of the mouth of the two witnesses with respect in general to the wars of the Thunders or Trum<a id="l1250"></a>pets.  But yet it seems to have a more particular respect to the war of the <a id="l1251"></a>first Trumpet.  For there this <em class="underline">fire is cast upon the earth &amp; the third <a id="l1252"></a>part of the trees are burnt up</em>.  In the second Trumpet or Thunder the <a id="l1253"></a>two witnesses exercise their <em class="underline">power over the waters to turn them to blood</em> <a id="l1254"></a>&amp; in the rest of the Trumpets &amp; Thunders they <em class="underline">smite the earth with all <a id="l1255"></a>plagues as often as they will</em>.  And thus in a few words is described both <a id="l1256"></a>generally &amp; particularly how the witnesses execute the plagues of the <a id="l1257"></a>Trumpets &amp; Thunders upon their enemies.  For these enemies in being <a id="l1258"></a>the people of the earth &amp; sea upon which the Angel stood with the book open in his <a id="l1259"></a>hand to prophesy, they are the earth &amp; sea upon which the plagues of the two <a id="l1260"></a>first Trumpets fell: and in being the Nations in  the outward court which was <a id="l1261"></a>left out unmeasured they are those of the twelve Tribes  who were left <a id="l1262"></a>out unsealed, &amp; on whom the plagues of the Trumpets fell as is exprest both <a id="l1263"></a>in the fift Trumpet &amp; in Ezekiels vision of sealing or marking a few &amp; learning <a id="l1264"></a>out the rest to be slain by the six men answering to the Angels of the first six <a id="l1265"></a>Trumpets.  And thus the prophesies agree also in the subject of the plagues.</p>
<p id="par52">So then in all the times of the seventh seale there are but two sorts of people <a id="l1266"></a>described, the true Church &amp; her enemies; the first in an afflicted condition, the last <a id="l1267"></a>prosperous &amp; potent; &amp; these two are described under various types.  They are repre<a id="l1268"></a>sented first by the twelve Tribes of Israel distinguished into two parts, the sealed ser<a id="l1269"></a>vants of God, &amp; the unsealed multitude; then by the Angel with the book open in his hand <a id="l1270"></a>&amp; by the earth &amp; sea upon which he stands; afterwards by those that worship in the measured <a id="l1271"></a>Temple, &amp; by the Nations in the outward unmeasured Court; also by the holy city &amp; <a id="l1272"></a>by the same nations who tread it down; then by the two witnesses &amp; the Nations or <a id="l1273"></a>great city to whom they prophesy; &amp; lastly by Christ crucified &amp; the same city <a id="l1274"></a>crucifying him.  For in calling the great city <a id="l1275"></a><em class="underline">Sodom &amp; Egypt where also <a id="l1276"></a>our Lord was crucified</em>, the people of that city are compared not only to the <a id="l1277"></a>unclean &amp; persecuting Gentiles of Canaan &amp; Egypt, but also to the Iews <a id="l1278"></a>who crucified Christ, &amp; the two witnesses slain in their streets are compared to Christ crucified.</p>

<h2 id="hd13" class="cent">Sec. IV. <a id="l1279"></a><br>The interpretation of the <a id="l1280"></a>Seales &amp; Trumpets</h2>
<h2 id="hd14" class="cent">The first part of the interpretation</h2>
<p id="par53">Hitherto I have explained the Prophesy of the Book in the Prophets <a id="l1281"></a>mouth. This &amp; the prophesy of the seales &amp; Trumpets and both together <a id="l1282"></a>with the sounding of the last Trumpet, &amp; then begins the bitter prophesy of the <a id="l1283"></a>same Book in the Prophets belly, which Prophesy is a repetition of the whole <a id="l1284"></a>Prophesy of the seales &amp; Trumpets by way of interpretation. The last <a id="l1285"></a>Trumpet sounds to the day of judgment, &amp; the description of that day ends <a id="l1286"></a>with these words; <em class="underline">Thy wrath is come &amp; the time of the dead</em> that they should <a id="l1287"></a>be judged &amp; that thou shouldst give reward unto thy servants the Prophets <a id="l1288"></a>&amp; to the saints &amp; to them that fear thy name both small &amp; great, &amp; <em class="underline">shouldst <a id="l1289"></a>destroy them that destroy the earth</em>. And the repetition begins with the next words, <a id="l1290"></a><em class="underline">And the Temple of God was opened in heaven</em>. As the prophesy of the seales <a id="l1291"></a>&amp; Trumpets began with a door opened in heaven through which the Prophet <a id="l1292"></a>might see the ensuing visions there so doth the repetition. A door is opened <a id="l1293"></a>in the Temple of heaven to let the Prophet see the ensuing Visions of the <a id="l1294"></a>woman &amp; dragon there. For these appear in heaven &amp; heaven is every <a id="l1295"></a>where in this Prophesy put for the Temple of heaven. For it is to be con<a id="l1296"></a>ceived that the war between Michael &amp; the Dragon was above in the inner court <a id="l1297"></a>of the Temple of heaven that the Dragon was cast out thence into the outward court, <a id="l1298"></a>that the heavens &amp; they that dwell in them who are led to rejoyce it this victory are <a id="l1299"></a>the Saints who worship in the Inner court Apoc. 8.3 &amp; 11.1 &amp; are now freed <a id="l1300"></a>from the tyranny of the persecuting Dragon there, that the inhabitants of the <a id="l1301"></a>Earth &amp; Sea to whom the Dragon comes down are the Nations to whom the <a id="l1302"></a>outward court is given Apoc. 11.2, &amp; to whom the Mighty Angel prophesied in <a id="l1303"></a>that court standing there upon the Earth &amp; Sea (Apoc 10.2, 3 &amp; 11.3,) that the ten horned <a id="l1304"></a>Beast &amp; two horned Beast arose in that court out of the Sea &amp; Earth upon which <a id="l1305"></a>the Angel stood, that the woman fled through that court into that wilderness into which the Scape Goat <a id="l1306"></a>used to be led, that in the beginning of her flight the Dragon cast out waters <a id="l1307"></a>as a flood after her in that court , &amp; that the well of the abyss out of which the Locusts ascend<a id="l1308"></a>ed &amp; into which the Dragon was cast was the common sink or shore of the Temple. <a id="l1309"></a>For this was an abyss of uncleanness &amp; at the foot of the Altar had a mouth <a id="l1310"></a>like a well with a stone cover to it.</p>
<p id="par54">The woman in heaven is plainly the Church of God, because her seed <a id="l1311"></a>keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Iesus Apoc. <a id="l1312"></a>12.1, 17. By the Sun wherewith she is conteined; by that moon under her feet the Pontifical <a id="l1313"></a>power of the kingdom trampled upon by her, &amp; by the twelve stars where<a id="l1314"></a>with she is crowned the Bishops &amp; Presbyters of the Church successors of <a id="l1315"></a>the twelve Apostles. For the Sun Moon &amp; Stars together signify all the powers <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p034r"> &lt;34r&gt; </span>  &amp; parts of a kingdome: &amp; therefore if the Stars signify the Princes of the <a id="l1316"></a>Church, the Sun &amp; Moon are to signify the rest; the Sun being the King <a id="l1317"></a>with his mystical body the kingdom, &amp; the Moon being the Pontifex Maxi<a id="l1318"></a>mus with his mystical body of Priests &amp; others his subjects in religious <a id="l1319"></a>affairs.</p>
<p id="par55">The great red Dragon,, since his heads are crowned, &amp; he makes <a id="l1320"></a>war &amp; persecutes the woman or Church, &amp; gives his power &amp; throne &amp; <a id="l1321"></a>great authority to the Beast, plainly signifies a Kingdom as Beasts in <a id="l1322"></a>prophesy generally do, &amp; this kingdom is hostile to the Church, &amp; by his <a id="l1323"></a>persecuting her must be that kingdom through which she is diffused, signi<a id="l1324"></a>fied before by the Sun. His seven crowned heads signify his reign under <a id="l1325"></a>seven successive Kings or Dynasties as is explained in the like heads of <a id="l1326"></a>the Beast Apoc. 17 &amp; so answer to the seven successive Dynasties of the <a id="l1327"></a>seven seales. For these in the Apocalyptic language are Kings. The <a id="l1328"></a>four first are represented by horsmen, &amp; a horsman in the prophetic <a id="l1329"></a>language is a King, riding being put for reigning &amp; the hors for <a id="l1330"></a>the people of the Kingdom, &amp; therefore if all the seven heads be of a <a id="l1331"></a>kind, they are seven successive Kings. And that they are so will appear <a id="l1332"></a>by the prophetical history of the woman &amp; Dragon, for therein are the <a id="l1333"></a>three last seales repeated &amp; described by three successive Kings of <a id="l1334"></a>the Dragon whereof the third is the Dragons seventh head as you will <a id="l1335"></a>understand by considering the repetition of the whole prophesy in order <a id="l1336"></a>as follows.</p>
<p id="par56">The prophesy of the seales began with the opening of a door in hea<a id="l1337"></a>ven, &amp; with the throne of God set in heaven which the Prophet saw through the <a id="l1338"></a>door, &amp; with lightnings &amp; thunderings &amp; voices proceeding out of the throne <a id="l1339"></a>(Apoc. 4.1, 2, 5) &amp; the repetition begins with the like visions in these words: <a id="l1340"></a><em class="underline">And the Temple of God was opened in heaven &amp; there was seen in his Temple <a id="l1341"></a>the Ark of his Testament, &amp; there were lightnings &amp; voices &amp; thundrings <a id="l1342"></a>&amp; an earth quake &amp; great hail</em>. In this repetition &amp; door of the Temple is <a id="l1343"></a>put for the door of heaven, &amp; the Ark for the throne of God by way of expli<a id="l1344"></a>cation, &amp; so confirms the interpretation of that door &amp; throne we gave above. <a id="l1345"></a>To the lightnings &amp; thundrings &amp; voices which there came out of the throne, <a id="l1346"></a>&amp; only allude to the sacrifices of the Temple, are here added earthquakes <a id="l1347"></a>&amp; great hail to inculcate that here they are prophetick, &amp; consequently typifie <a id="l1348"></a>the first wars of the prophesy, that is the wars of the four horsmen with which the prophesy <a id="l1349"></a>begins. For those horsmen are warriors, the first having a bow, &amp; going forth <a id="l1350"></a>conquering &amp; to conquer, the second having a great sword, &amp; all of them <a id="l1351"></a>having armies typified by the four Beasts. For those Beasts being squa<a id="l1352"></a>drons of men encamped each under banners, may when conjoyned <a id="l1353"></a>with the horsmen fitly typifie their armies, the same type in divers respects <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p035r"> &lt;35r&gt; </span>  &amp; circumstances having divers significations. And thus each horsman with <a id="l1354"></a>his hors &amp; one of the four Beasts will represent a Soveraign Commander or Emperour with his Empire &amp; army.</p>
<p id="par57">After the wars of the Kingdom follow the affairs of the Church, &amp; these <a id="l1355"></a>begin to be described in the fift seale &amp; in the vision of the woman and <a id="l1356"></a>Dragon. In the fift seale is described a great persecution of the Church <a id="l1357"></a>there appearing under the Altar (that is at the foot of it were the sacrifices <a id="l1358"></a>were slain) the soules of them that were slain for the word of God by those <a id="l1359"></a>that dwell on the Earth against whom they cry for vengeance. And this <a id="l1360"></a>persecution is repeated by the womans crying in pain of travail, &amp; by <a id="l1361"></a>the Dragons drawing the third part of the Stars (or Saints) of heaven <a id="l1362"></a>with his tail (or army of Souldiers &amp; Magistrates) &amp; casting them to <a id="l1363"></a>the Earth: of which persecution the woman's being cloathed with the scorching <a id="l1364"></a>hot Sun is also a very proper Emblem. Now where the history of the <a id="l1365"></a>Dragon &amp; woman begins, there ought we to begin the reign of one of <a id="l1366"></a>the Kings or heads of the Dragon, &amp; so this King falls in with the fift <a id="l1367"></a>seale, &amp; is the fift King reconing the horsmen for the first four.</p>
<p id="par58">In the sixt seale is described the overthrow of the persecuting <a id="l1368"></a>idolatrous Kingdom the Stars which there fall like figgs &amp; the Men which <a id="l1369"></a>had hid themselves being Idols &amp; the Mountains &amp; Rocks idol Temples, <a id="l1370"></a>&amp; the Sun &amp; Moon which are smitten being the  Kingdom and <a id="l1371"></a>Priesthood. And this is repeated by the overflow &amp; dethroning of the <a id="l1372"></a>Dragon (that old Serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan who deceiveth the <a id="l1373"></a>whole world) &amp; his Angels by Michael &amp; his Angels who overcome <a id="l1374"></a>them by the blood of the Lamb, &amp; by the word of their Testimony, which <a id="l1375"></a>they gave in the preceeding persecution wherein they loved not their <a id="l1376"></a>lives unto the death. And now the Dragon being cast down to the earth <a id="l1377"></a>from his old throne in heaven begins a new reign among the inhabitants <a id="l1378"></a>of the Earth &amp; Sea, whereupon a wo is denounced to them: Wo be to <a id="l1379"></a>the inhabitants of the Earth &amp; Sea, because the Devil is come down <a id="l1380"></a>amongst you, here then begins a new head of the Dragon. For the <a id="l1381"></a>better understanding of which it is to be conceived that the Manchild succeeded <a id="l1382"></a>the Dragon in his throne in heaven, being then caught up to God &amp; his <a id="l1383"></a>throne, that is to the throne of the kingdom, when the Dragon was cast down. <a id="l1384"></a>For so soon as he was caught up the woman fled into the wilderness Apoc. <a id="l1385"></a>12. v. 5, 6) &amp; thither she fled not till after the Dragon was cast down <a id="l1386"></a>v. 14. As every Child is of the same kind with his Parents, so the Man<a id="l1387"></a>child must be a body of the same kind with the Woman, the difference <a id="l1388"></a>of sex only excepted, &amp; therefore not a single person but a body of <a id="l1389"></a>men, a masculine body of Christians as she is a feminine, &amp; consequently <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p036r"> &lt;36r&gt; </span>When therefore the saints enter into the  temple to worship God  be sealed with his seale then do the nations enter into the outward Court to <a id="l1391"></a> worship the Beast &amp; his Image &amp; receive his mark. For things related <a id="l1392"></a>to one another by way of opposition are always synchronal.  In the <a id="l1393"></a>time of this worship was the sacrifice of Gods lot offered upon the Altar &amp; therefore <a id="l1394"></a>the temple &amp; altar &amp; they that worship therein are now measured whilst the <a id="l1395"></a>outward court is left  out &amp; not measured. For this measuring (as I said)  <a id="l1396"></a>denotes the same thing with  numbring &amp; sealing the servants of God &amp; leaving all <a id="l1397"></a>rest unsealed.  And the temple &amp; altar which were measuring  are mythical &amp; denote one  the saints  who worship in it called in  next words the holy City &amp; the other the martyrs who are sacrificed upon it called in the next words the two  martyrs or witnesses  For these witnesses are not single persons but the churches of God because in the next words they  are called Candlesticks. For Candlesticks are Churches Apoc. 1. So then these witnesses &amp; the Altar &amp; Temple &amp;  holy City &amp; the sealed servants of God &amp; remnant of the womans seed are but severall names given in several respects to one &amp; the same people of God &amp; in so many respects &amp; in so many respects  is the apostasy <a id="l1412"></a>opposed to them under  as many names &amp; considerations. To the two prophesying witnesses is opposed the two horned fals Prophet <a id="l1413"></a> to the holy City the great city of the nations which treads it under foot that great city Babylon, to the measured Temple &amp; altar &amp; them that wor<a id="l1414"></a>ship therein the unmeasured outward court &amp; the nations who worship in it &amp; by <a id="l1415"></a>persecutions &amp; murders tred under foot the holy city, to the sealed servants of God <a id="l1416"></a>the unsealed twelve tribes who receive the mark of the Beast  the womans seed . Who keep the <a id="l1417"></a>commandments of God,  &amp; are slain for not worshipping the Image all those that turn aside from those commandments to  keep the <a id="l1418"></a>commandments of the fals Prophet &amp;  of that  Image  <a id="l1419"></a>which speaks as an Oracle. All these things are related to one another by way of <a id="l1420"></a>opposition &amp; therefore are synchronal. The great Apostasy together with the two wicked Beasts arose at the open<a id="l1421"></a>ing of the seventh seal &amp; therefore the Prophet is very elaborate in the <a id="l1422"></a>description of the things which belong to this period.</p>
<p id="par59"> So then the vision of the 144000 sealed servants of God &amp; of the Lamb opening the seals is repeated &amp; interpreted in the rem<a id="l1423"></a>nant of the womans seed who receive not the mark &amp; name of the Beast but imme<a id="l1424"></a>diately after the  worshippers of the Beast &amp; of his image <a id="l1425"></a>have  received his mark &amp; name  stand on Mount Sion <a id="l1426"></a>with the Lamb &amp; have name of God in their foreheads, &amp; are in number 144000. By this standing <a id="l1427"></a>on Mount Sion they are known to be Israelites &amp; therefore were numbered &amp; marked with the <a id="l1428"></a>name of God out of the twelve tribes as the others were numbered &amp; sealed out <a id="l1429"></a>of then. Whence the rest who receive the mark of the Beast are the rest of <a id="l1430"></a>the twelve tribes, such as say they are Iews &amp; are not &amp; worship in the outward <a id="l1431"></a>Court of the Temple but by worshipping the Dragon &amp; Beast are become the Synagogue <a id="l1432"></a>of Satan as has been shewed. The 144000 stand with the Lamb on mount Sion &amp; by <a id="l1433"></a>a sequence in the Temple where the Lamb was, <a id="l1434"></a>&amp; opened the seals. For there all the visions <a id="l1435"></a>appear &amp; there they sing the new <a id="l1436"></a>song before the throne &amp; <a id="l1437"></a>before the four Beasts <a id="l1438"></a>&amp; the Elders <a id="l1439"></a>&amp;c. – – –  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p037r"> &lt;37r&gt; </span> as shall be proved hereafter -- that plague fell upon the men who had <a id="l1440"></a>the mark of the Beast &amp; worshipped his Image,  Apoc 16 <a id="l1441"></a>&amp; therefore the twelve Tribes as many as were not sealed which the seale  of God receive the <a id="l1442"></a>mark  of the Beast. The twelve tribes or Church there as I said above  became <a id="l1443"></a>now  separated into two parts. the one Gods <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> the other the  the Beasts &amp; at the separa<a id="l1444"></a>ting of the one from the other each part received the mark or name of his master <a id="l1445"></a>in their foreheads, &amp;  from then forward  worshipped him whose <a id="l1446"></a>mark &amp; name he had received. And thence the worshippers of the Beast <a id="l1447"></a>are called the synagogue of  Satan who say they are Iews &amp; <a id="l1448"></a>are not but do lye.</p>
<p id="par60"> Now from these things  it's evident first that at the opening of the seventh Seal there is a great Apostasy of <a id="l1449"></a>the 12 Tribes &amp; secondly that the 144000 are excommunicated by the rest &amp; thereby numbered out &amp; separated from them.  for the  Beast which hath two horns <a id="l1452"></a>like the Lamb (that is  ecclesical ones like  the   Lambs seven horns &amp; so is the Church of the Apostates) <a id="l1453"></a> causeth all men to receive a mark &amp; that no man might buy or sell <a id="l1454"></a>save he that had the mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his <a id="l1455"></a>name; that is he excommunicates them, &amp; thereby causeth the aforesaid separation <a id="l1456"></a>of those who will not receive the Beasts mark from those that do receive <a id="l1457"></a>it. </p>
<p id="par61">.</p>
<p id="par62">Thirdly that the execution of this excommunication commenced with a dissolution of  the bodies ecclesiastic of all  For the two horned beast  doth greet <a id="l1463"></a>miracles so that he causeth fire come down from heaven (that is war from the <a id="l1464"></a>throne) in the sight of men, &amp; that the Image he then sets  up should speak <a id="l1465"></a>as an Oracle &amp; cause that as many as would not worship it should be killed, <a id="l1466"></a>that is not by a natural death for so the true church would have been at an <a id="l1467"></a>end but by a dissolution of their  societies or bodies  whether civil or ecclesiastic <a id="l1468"></a>So then those that were killed &amp; those that were prohibited buying &amp; selling <a id="l1469"></a>&amp; those that immediately after stand on mount Sion are one &amp; the same men <a id="l1470"></a>in different respects. For they are all of them the  whole true Church. And <a id="l1471"></a>for the same reason they  are also the same with the remnant of the womans seed whom the <a id="l1472"></a>Dragon went to make war upon. She being the Church catholic her seed who kept the vow with God were all the faithfull &amp; all those &amp; none others were killed because all were killed who would not worship the Image &amp; all worshipped the beast &amp; his Image whose names were not written in the book of life. <a id="l1473"></a>Fourthly that the temporal sword by which these things are now put in executing <a id="l1474"></a>is the Dragons. For it was he that at this time went to make war with the <a id="l1475"></a>remnant of the womans seed,  &amp; they in that war kept the command<a id="l1476"></a>ments of God &amp; had the testimony of Iesus, that is  by keeping Gods command became  his witnesses or Martyrs whilst the multitude of the twelve <a id="l1479"></a>tribes fell away to the worship of the Beast &amp; his Image. For the faithfull martyr <a id="l1480"></a>Antipas was slain where Satan dwelleth, that is in the Kingdom of the Dragon that <a id="l1481"></a>old serpent called the Devil and Satan.</p>
<p id="par63">So then at the  opening of the seventh <a id="l1482"></a>Seal the saints fell into great affliction &amp; therefore this time (as was shewed above)  is represented there by the <a id="l1483"></a>great Fast or  day of expiation  wherein the prayers of the afflicted saints are offered <a id="l1484"></a>with incense upon the golden altar &amp; in allusion to the two goats on whose heads the high <a id="l1485"></a>Priest laid the names of God &amp; Azazel sending the lot of Azazel into the wilder<a id="l1486"></a>ness laden with the sins of the people, &amp; sacrificing the Lords lot, the twelve tribes <a id="l1487"></a>are sealed in their foreheads partly with the seale &amp; name of God  &amp; partly <a id="l1488"></a>with the mark  &amp; name of the Beast &amp; whilst the one goes away into the <a id="l1489"></a>Wildernesse the other is sacrificed in the war which the Dragon made upon them, &amp; so becomes the Martyr Antipas..</p>
<p id="par64"> As the seal of God is opposed to the mark of the Beast so the worship of God in this Fast <a id="l1490"></a>is opposed to the worship of the Beast &amp; his Image, &amp; therefore all these are synchronal.</p>
<p id="par65"><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p037v"> &lt;37v&gt; </span>In the next place appear the  four Angels  of the first four Trumpets <a id="l1492"></a>holding the four winds wherewith they were at the sounding of those Trumpets to hurt the earth &amp; the sea &amp; <a id="l1493"></a>the trees:  &amp; upon their appearance the  144000 <a id="l1494"></a>servants of God are numbred out of the 12 Tribes &amp; sealed in their foreheads.  Now these things <a id="l1495"></a>being done at the opening of the seventh seal which is one of the main <a id="l1496"></a>periods in all the Apocalyps, they answer to divers contemporary things <a id="l1497"></a>&amp; first to the  womans flying into the wilderness &amp; having a remnant of her <a id="l1498"></a>seed.  For the <a id="l1499"></a> twelve tribes  are the Church catholic &amp; consequently answer to the <a id="l1500"></a>Woman crowned with a crown of 12 stars, &amp; the servants of God numbered <a id="l1501"></a>&amp; sealed out of the tribes answer to the remnant of the womans seed who keep <a id="l1502"></a>the commandments of God. The numbering &amp; sealing a few out of all the <a id="l1503"></a>tribes denotes a division of the church into two parts: the  select number <a id="l1504"></a>of sealed ones &amp; the  rest left unsealed: &amp; the like division of the Church is signified by <a id="l1505"></a>the Woman's flying into the Wildernesse &amp; leaving a remnant of her seed <a id="l1506"></a>For she fled from the face of the serpent  <a id="l1508"></a>into the wilderness  unto her place  that they should feed &amp; nourish her there, <a id="l1509"></a>that is she fled from persecution into the  wilderness  barren of  saints (who are the green trees <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) unto her  <a id="l1510"></a>place of honour &amp; glory there  that the Merchants of the Earth should feed <a id="l1511"></a>her luxuriously (as they did the great Whore) while the remnant of her seed kept <a id="l1512"></a>the commandments of  God &amp;  under the persecuting Dragon had the <a id="l1513"></a>testimony of Iesus. So then there is the like division of the Church catholic <a id="l1514"></a>into two parts in both  prophesies &amp; therefore the prophesies answer to one another.</p>
<p id="par66">In the next place the said things done at the opening of the seventh seal <a id="l1515"></a>answer to the beginning of the seventh head of the Dragon &amp; Beast &amp; con<a id="l1516"></a>sequently to the time when the Beast rose out of the Sea &amp; the Dragon <a id="l1517"></a>gave him his throne &amp; power &amp; great authority. For when the Dragon <a id="l1518"></a>left his old throne his former reign or head ceased &amp; a new one began &amp; <a id="l1519"></a>the Beast which rose out of the abyss or Sea he is the eighth &amp; of the <a id="l1520"></a>seven. But of this more hereafter.</p>
<p id="par67">In the third  place they answer most plainly to the  two horned Beasts causing <a id="l1521"></a>all men to receive the mark or name  of the Beast  &amp; to the 144000 on mount Sion with the name of God in their <a id="l1527"></a>foreheads. When the 144000 servants of God are  sealed  in their foreheads &amp; numbered, then do the servants of the beast receive his mark <a id="l1529"></a> in their foreheads or  his name &amp; number: for  immediately after do the 144000 sealed ones stand <a id="l1530"></a>on mount Sion with the name of God in their foreheads. The sealing the <a id="l1531"></a>one &amp; marking the other are opposites &amp; therefore synchronal.  The <a id="l1532"></a>servants of God were sealed  before the four winds  hurt the <a id="l1533"></a>earth &amp; sea &amp; trees in the Trumpets that they might escape being hurt &amp; therefore the rest <a id="l1534"></a>of the Tribes who were not sealed were the men hurt by those winds.  For it is exprest that the plague of the fift Trumpet fell upon the men who <a id="l1536"></a>had not the seal of God in their foreheads.  So then the men upon whom the plague of the first <a id="l1537"></a>wind or Trumpet fell  were those who had not the seal of God in their foreheads <a id="l1538"></a> Now the plague of this Trumpet is the same with that of the first <a id="l1539"></a>Vial. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p038r"> &lt;38r&gt; </span> a Christian Kingdom. This Kingdom the Dragon endeavoured to devour so <a id="l1540"></a>soon as it was born, &amp; thereupon arose the war in heaven. 'Twas im<a id="l1541"></a>proper to represent a Child a Warrior, &amp; therefore his Angel Michael <a id="l1542"></a>is put in his stead. For in what respect the Kingdom of the Dragon is <a id="l1543"></a>called by the name of his Angel that old Serpent the Devil &amp; Satan in the <a id="l1544"></a>same respect is the Kingdom of the Manchild called by the name of his <a id="l1545"></a>between their Angels, Michael &amp; his Angels fighting against the old <a id="l1546"></a>Serpent &amp; his Angels. And upon the Dragon's being cast down to signify <a id="l1547"></a>that the Manchild was then caught up to the throne, there was heard a <a id="l1548"></a>loud voice in heaven saying, now is come salvation &amp; strength &amp; the <a id="l1549"></a><em class="underline">Kingdom of our God</em>. So then the succession of the Manchild puts an <a id="l1550"></a>end to the reign of the Dragon in heaven, &amp; with his new reign on Earth <a id="l1551"></a>amongst the inhabitants of the Earth or sea begins a new dynasty or <a id="l1552"></a>head. For the Dragon a little after gave the Beast his throne &amp; power <a id="l1553"></a>&amp; great authority, &amp; therefore reigned on Earth after he was cast <a id="l1554"></a>down. Seing therefore that at the opening of the sixt seale this fall of <a id="l1555"></a>the idolatrous Kingdom is described, the sixt had of the Dragon will <a id="l1556"></a>fall in with the times of that seale.</p>
<p id="par68">In the next place appear the four Angels of the first four Trumpets <a id="l1557"></a>holding the four winds wherewith they were in those Trumpets to hurt the Earth &amp; Sea &amp; trees. And their first appearance being synchronal <a id="l1558"></a>to the opening of the seventh seale answers to the beginning of the se<a id="l1559"></a>venth head, &amp; consequently to the time when the Beast rose out of the <a id="l1560"></a>Sea, &amp; the Dragon gave him his throne &amp; power &amp; great authority. <a id="l1561"></a>For when the Dragon left his old throne, his former reign or head <a id="l1562"></a>ceased &amp; a new one began. But of this more hereafter.</p>
<p id="par69">#<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 35v &gt; </span>While these Angels hold the winds the 144000  servants of God are sealed that is those who now serve God in his Temple &amp; thereby are opposed to the rest who now worship the Dragon &amp; the Beast &amp; his Image &amp; for that reason are left unsealed. For at ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  the opening of the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for half an hour &amp; during that silence the prayers of the saints were offered  up to God with incense on the golden altar: &amp; to this worship of God in the Temple is opposed mens beginning now to worship the beast &amp; his Image. For these are the Gentiles or nations  to whom the outward court of the temple was now given for their worship. When therefore the saints enter into the inward Temple to worship God, then do the nations enter into the outward court to worship the beast &amp; his Image. For things related to one another as opposites are always synchronal. At that time the Image spake &amp; caused that as many as would not worship it should be killed, that is mystically by a dissolution of their bodies ecclesiastic &amp; thereby all the saints became the martyrs or witnesses of Iesus that is the two  Witnesses. For those witnesses are the Candlesticks that is the Churches of God, &amp; being first mentioned at the  measuring of the Temple &amp; Altar &amp; them that worship therein that is at the numbring of the saints whose prayers are offered up with incense, commence with the opening of the seventh seal. For when the saints worshipped in the temple then were these martyrs offered up a sacrifice to God upon the Altar. For the Temple &amp; Altar which were measured are mystical &amp; signify the one  saints who worship  in it called in the next words the holy city &amp; the other  the martyrs who are sacrificed upon it, called in the next words the  two martyrs or witnesses. Now these martyrs or witnesses are the remnant of the womans seed who kept the commandments of Iesus  when she fled away into the spiritually barren wilderness, &amp; whom the Dragon then went to make war with. For now at the sentence of the speaking Image it si to be conceived that the Dragon makes that war upon them &amp; kills them. For in that war  they keep the commandments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus that is  are his witnesses or martyrs. As many as would not worship the image are killed &amp; by consequence all the  womans seed. She being the Church catholic her seed were all the faithfull &amp; therefore they were all that were killed So then the Prophet after the Dragon went to make war with the remnant of the womans seed is very large in the description of things done at the opening of the seventh seal &amp; spends all his time therein till he has told how the Image of the Beast was made &amp;  by speaking causes  all those to be killed who will not worship it. For this period is a very notable one &amp; therefore deserved to be elaborately described. And having noted the time of all these things I now proceed.</p>
<p id="par70">In the next place therefore the 144000 servants of God are numbred &amp; sealed -- -- #<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 38r resumes &gt; </span>  the 144000 servants of God are numbred &amp; sealed# in their foreheads out of all the tribes of Israel &amp; there by separated from the rest and <a id="l1563"></a>this is repeated partly by the separation of the Church into the woman &amp; her seed, partly by the  marke or name &amp; number of the Beast which <a id="l1564"></a>the two horned Beast causeth all the wicked to receive in their foreheads <a id="l1565"></a>&amp; right hands in opposition to the  numbered &amp; sealed saints &amp; partly by the 144000 standing immediately after <a id="l1566"></a>on mount Sion with the name of God on their foreheads: which have the seale <a id="l1567"></a>of God &amp; are numbred by his number &amp; those which have the mark &amp; number of the Beast are related to one <a id="l1568"></a>another by way of opposition: the one must be sealed when the other <a id="l1569"></a>were marked. By their standing on mount Sion they are known to be Israelites, &amp; therefore were marked with the name of God out of the twelve Tribes,  as the others were sealed out of them. Whence the rest who receive the mark of the Beast are the rest of the twelve tribes, such as say they are Iews &amp; are not  &amp; worship in the outward court of the Temple but by worshipping the  Dragon &amp; Beast are become the synagogue of Satan. The 144000 stand with the lamb  once mount Sion &amp; by consequence in the Temple where the Lamb was. For there - - - <a id="l1570"></a>. For there all the Visions appear, &amp; there they sing the new ‡ song <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 35v &gt; </span>‡ song before the throne &amp; before the four beasts &amp; the elders, which song no man could learn but themselves. They are therefore the Quire of the Temple which sang the sacred song in the time of the sacrifices, &amp; so are contemporary to the sacrifices to which the seven Trumpets sound as the sealed servants of God also are. For Iohn hears them  as the voice of many waters &amp; as the voice of a great thunder &amp; the voice of harpers harping with their harps, &amp; singing this new song: all which is a plain description of the musick of the Temple as we shewed above.</p>

And in <a id="l1575"></a>like manner in the repetition after the preaching of the gospel <a id="l1576"></a>to all nations Apoc 14.6 there is a great tribulation first ushered <a id="l1577"></a>in with an inhibition to worship the Beast &amp; his Image vers. 9, &amp; <a id="l1578"></a>with these exclamations, <em class="underline">Here is the patience of the saints, here <a id="l1579"></a>are they that keep the Commandments of God &amp; the faith of Iesus <a id="l1580"></a>Blessed are the dead which dy in the Lord</em> vers 12,13; &amp; then <a id="l1581"></a>described by the Harvest of the Earth vers 14. For the first fruits <a id="l1582"></a>of this Harvest were the 144000 sealed servants of God vers 4, <a id="l1583"></a>&amp; the Harvest must be of the same kind with the first fruits, &amp; <a id="l1584"></a>consequently a holy people reaped or cut down by persecution. <a id="l1585"></a>And therefore as in the like Parable of the harvest in Matt. <a id="l1586"></a>13 Christ commands Christ commands the reapers to gather <a id="l1587"></a>the wheat into his barn, so here the Son of man reaps the <a id="l1588"></a>Harvest with a sharp sickle to shew that it is his. And as the <a id="l1589"></a>tribulation is described by the harvest, so the delivery of the <a id="l1590"></a>Palm-bearing multitude out of it is described by the ensuing <a id="l1591"></a>vintage of the wicked who are cut down with another sharp <a id="l1592"></a>sickle &amp; whose blood comes out of the wine press of the <a id="l1593"></a>wrath of God to the hors bridles of the Victors. For as the <a id="l1594"></a>palms in the hands of the great multitude are an Emblem <a id="l1595"></a>of victory &amp; triumph, so the vintage denotes a great victory <a id="l1596"></a>of the saints over the wicked obtained by the armies of him <a id="l1597"></a>who smites the nations &amp; treadeth the winepress of the fierceness &amp; wrath of almighty God, (Apoc. 19.15) as shall be explained hereafter.</p>
<h2 id="hd15" class="cent">The second part of the interpretation</h2>
<p id="par72">After this Palm-bearing multitude the Prophet sees the seven <a id="l1598"></a>Angels which stood before God &amp; to them were given seven Trumpets <a id="l1599"></a>upon the sounding of which there ensued seven great plagues of war: <a id="l1600"></a>all which the Prophet (next after the Vintage) thus repeats, <em class="underline">I saw saith he another <a id="l1601"></a>sign in heaven great &amp; marvellous seven Angels having the <a id="l1602"></a>seven last plagues, for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</em> <a id="l1603"></a>For these are called the seven last plagues to signify that <a id="l1604"></a>they are the last mentioned plagues wherewith the two wit<a id="l1605"></a>nesses smite the earth as often as they will, or the plagues <a id="l1606"></a>of the last times &amp; the same with the prophesy <a id="l1607"></a>of the seals &amp; trumpets whereof the last is inflicted at the sound<a id="l1608"></a>ing of the last Trumpet. The seven seales are the first <a id="l1609"></a>plagues inflicted upon the Iews heathens &amp; true Christians &amp; <a id="l1610"></a>the seven Trumpets or Thunders the last inflicted upon the <a id="l1611"></a>Apostates of the last times. πληγη is properly  a plague inflicted by striking a stroke or wound &amp; thence is sometimes taken for slaughter: so that the seven last plagues are plagues of war  or plagues of trumpets sounding to war &amp; therefore they are joyned with them who get a victory thereby. These plagues fall upon the Beast (chap. 16.2, 10, 13, 19) &amp; tis over him that the Victors get the victory.</p>
<p id="par73">In the time of the plagues of the Trumpets, a mighty Angel  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p040r"> &lt;40r&gt; </span>  cloathed with a cloud (that is the mystical body of Christ <a id="l1612"></a>cloathed with a multitude) stood upon the <em class="underline">Sea &amp; earth</em> &amp;  <a id="l1613"></a>the seven thunders of that cloud  uttered their voices, <a id="l1614"></a>. And this is repeated in the vision of the <em class="underline">Sea of glass</em> <a id="l1620"></a>&amp; of them that get the victory over the Beast &amp; over his <a id="l1621"></a>Image standing on the sea of glass with harps &amp; singing the song of <a id="l1622"></a>Moses &amp; the Lamb.  For you are to conceive that these Victors <a id="l1625"></a>stand at the last gate of the Priest's court where the Quire of the <a id="l1626"></a>Temple used to stand &amp; that the Prophet standing at the east gate of <a id="l1627"></a>the outward Court sees them there with their feet standing as it <a id="l1628"></a> were upon the top of the great brazen sea &amp; that this sea <a id="l1629"></a>appears mingled with the fire of the Altar through which the Pro<a id="l1630"></a>phet sees it. By the posture therefore of these victors &amp; by their <a id="l1631"></a>singing with Harps you may know that they are the Quire of <a id="l1632"></a>the Temple singing at the burnt sacrifices there offered &amp; <a id="l1633"></a>by consequence their song is the voice of one or more of the seven thunders <a id="l1634"></a>&amp; that the wars in which they get the victory are one or more of those signi<a id="l1635"></a>fied by the burnt sacrifices at which the Trumpets always sounded &amp; the Quire sang <a id="l1636"></a>alternately, that is the wars of one or more of the seven Trumpets here called <a id="l1637"></a>the seven last plagues,  as you may understand also by the song it <a id="l1642"></a>self which concludes thus: <em class="underline">For all nations shall come &amp; worship <a id="l1643"></a>before thee, for thy judgments are made manifest</em>, that is <a id="l1644"></a>the judgments of the seven plagues mentioned immediately before <a id="l1645"></a>This song is called the song of the Lamb  &amp; sung with <a id="l1646"></a>harps to intimate that it is the song of the 144000 which stand <a id="l1647"></a>on mount Sion the Lamb &amp; sing a new song with harps chap. 14 <a id="l1648"></a>which song we told you was  sung in the Temple <a id="l1649"></a>at the sacrifices of the Trumpets &amp; Thunders. Tis also called <a id="l1650"></a>the song of Moses to insinuate that in the Victor's standing on the <a id="l1651"></a>sea of glass mingled with fire whose colour is red, the Israelites <a id="l1652"></a> passing over the frozen red sea (Exod. 15.8) are alluded unto &amp; that <a id="l1653"></a>the Beast over whom they get the victory is that Beast which <a id="l1654"></a>makes war upon the two witnesses in the streets of the great city <a id="l1655"></a>spiritually called Egypt (Apoc. 11.8) &amp; that the Victors are the mystical body <a id="l1656"></a>of the two witnesses, Moses &amp; Aaron who turn the waters of this <a id="l1657"></a>Egypt into blood &amp; smite the land thereof with all plagues as often  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p041r"> &lt;41r&gt; </span>  as they will (vers 6) untill in the last plague, after the Beast <a id="l1658"></a>has hurt them in the war which he was to make upon them, their <a id="l1659"></a>enemies be devoured by the fire which comes (as it were) out of their <a id="l1660"></a>mouth (vers 5) &amp; is mingled with the sea of glass &amp; then for this <a id="l1661"></a>victory &amp; final deliverance of Gods people out of bondage they <a id="l1662"></a>sing the song of Moses. So then they plague their enemies with <a id="l1663"></a>many wars but get the victory in the last. For tis properly in respect <a id="l1664"></a>of the  battel of the great day of God Almighty at the last <a id="l1665"></a>Vial (ch. 16.14) that they are said to get the victory.  For <a id="l1666"></a>in that Battel &amp; not before the Beast is vanquished &amp; the cities <a id="l1667"></a>of the nations fall,  as shall be explained hereafter. Yet do they before this time get a spiritual victory over the worship of the Beast &amp; over his image &amp; over the number of his name: For there are those who in all the Epistles to the seven Churches are said to overcome it. But in the last Vial they get a victory both spiritual &amp; temporal &amp; become  the Church triumphant  represented by the Palm-bearing multitude.</p>
<p id="par74">When the Prophet is to describe collateral things, his method <a id="l1668"></a>is to interweave them. So here to signify that the vision of the <a id="l1669"></a>Victors is collateral to that of  the seven  Angel, he interweaves <a id="l1670"></a>them, mentioning first the appearance of the seven Angels with <a id="l1671"></a>them, mentioning first the appearance of the seven Angels with <a id="l1672"></a>their plagues &amp; then describing the vision of the Victors &amp; their <a id="l1673"></a>song &amp; afterwards returning to describe in a new vision the <a id="l1674"></a>history of the seven Angels from their very first appearance <a id="l1675"></a>in these words. <em class="underline">And after these things I looked &amp; behold <a id="l1676"></a>the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony in heaven <a id="l1677"></a>was opened &amp; the seven Angels came out of the Temple having <a id="l1678"></a>the seven plagues</em>. When the Temple was opened that they might <a id="l1679"></a>come out &amp; be seen then was their first appearance, &amp; therefore <a id="l1680"></a>the Victors  are later then the opening of the Temple <a id="l1681"></a>&amp; so  fall in which the Vials,  or  which the last of them. For tis by the seven plagues that they get the victory.</p>
<p id="par75">We said that these plagues are a repetition of the plagues <a id="l1682"></a>of the Trumpets. For as the Angels sounding the Trumpets are <a id="l1683"></a>the Priests sounding at the Iewish sacrifices, so the Angels inflicting  the seven plagues &amp; pouring <a id="l1684"></a>out their golden Vials of wrath are the Priests offering seven burnt sacrifices &amp; pouring out <a id="l1685"></a>the drink offerings of those sacrifices out of the golden vials of <a id="l1686"></a>the Temple. For by their being cloathed with white linnen <a id="l1687"></a>&amp; having their Breasts girded with golden girdles, which was the <a id="l1688"></a>Priests habit &amp; by their coming out of the Temple which <a id="l1689"></a>none entred into but Priests it is evident that they are Priests <a id="l1690"></a>serving in the Temple &amp; by consequence that in pouring <a id="l1691"></a>out their golden Vials they offer drink offerings. For these <a id="l1692"></a>Vials as they are of gold like<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n46-ref">[46]</sup> those in the Temple so they are filled <a id="l1693"></a>with wine which was the <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n47-ref">[47]</sup> drink offering of the Iewish sacrifices. For the <a id="l1694"></a>seventh Vial is called the cup of the wine of the fierceness of the wrath <a id="l1695"></a>of God &amp; given great Babylon to drink because she made all nations <a id="l1696"></a>drink out of the golden cup of the wine of her fornication, that is in their <a id="l1697"></a>idolatrous sacrifices to a fals God represented by their worshipping the Beast <a id="l1698"></a>&amp; his Image Apoc. 16.19 &amp; 14.8, 9, 10. And hence you may learn that whilst <a id="l1699"></a>all the Vials are called Vials of God's wrath, the meaning is that they <a id="l1700"></a>are vials of the wine of God's wrath. This wine is called the blood of <a id="l1701"></a>the grapes troden, in the great winepress of God's wrath (Apoc. 14.20) &amp; <a id="l1702"></a>therefore the pouring out the Vials of wrath is a fit emblem of effusion <a id="l1703"></a>of the blood of the wicked nations in the wars to which the Trumpets sound <a id="l1704"></a>&amp; hath much the same signification with treading out the blood of grapes in a <a id="l1705"></a>winepress. For this sense is affixt by the Prophet Ieremy to both these  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p042r"> &lt;42r&gt; </span>  phrases there where he makes all nations drink of the <em class="underline">wine-cup of God's fury</em> <a id="l1706"></a>that they may <em class="underline">be drunken &amp; spue &amp; fall &amp; rise no more because of the <a id="l1707"></a>sword which he will send amongst them</em> &amp; saith that the Lord shall <a id="l1708"></a><em class="underline">roar from on high &amp; give a shout as that tread the grapes against <a id="l1709"></a>allthe  inhabitants of the earth &amp; the slain of the Lord shall <a id="l1710"></a>be at that day from one end of the earth to the other end thereof.</em> Ier. 25. And whilst the Vials are the drink offerings of the sacrifices the plagues being slaughters must be the sacrifices themselves. For sacrifices are the proper type of slaughters in war Isa. 34.6 Ier 46.10. Ezek. 39.17, 19. Zeph. 1.7, 8. And thus you may understand how the Angels had the seven last plagues before they received the Vials. First they had sacrifices &amp; the one of the four Beasts gave them the Drink offering. To describe the Temple - musick &amp; drink offerings as is done in the Trumpets Thunders &amp; Vials &amp; omit the sacrifices themselves would have been improper.</p>
<p id="par76">We shewed that the seven Trumpets allude to the sacrifices of the <a id="l1711"></a>seven days of the feast of Tabernacles &amp; so do the plagues &amp; Vials. For considering <a id="l1712"></a>that immediately after the seven Angels come out of the temple they <a id="l1713"></a>received their Vials &amp; then the Temple was filled with smoak from <a id="l1714"></a>the glory of God &amp; from his power so that no man was able to <a id="l1715"></a>enter into the Temple untill the seven plagues of the seven Angels <a id="l1716"></a>were fulfilled: the dedication of the Temple by Solomon is herein <a id="l1717"></a>plainly alluded unto. For in that dedication so soon as the Priests <a id="l1718"></a>had placed the Ark in the most holy &amp; came out thence &amp; lift up <a id="l1719"></a>their voice with Trumpets &amp; musical instruments to praise the Lord <a id="l1720"></a>the Temple was filled with a cloud (1 Kings 8.10, 11, 12) &amp; fire came <a id="l1721"></a>down from heaven &amp; consumed the burnt sacrifices &amp; the glory <a id="l1722"></a>of the Lord filled the house, &amp; the Priests could not enter into the house <a id="l1723"></a>of the Lord because the glory of the Lord has filled the house <a id="l1724"></a>(2 Chron. 7.1, 2). Now this solemnity of the dedication was kept <a id="l1725"></a>on the seven days of the feast of Tabernacles. For all Israel <a id="l1726"></a>assembled at the Feast of the seventh month to bring the Ark <a id="l1727"></a>into the Temple (1 Kings 8.2. 2 Chron. 5.3) &amp; kept the dedication <a id="l1728"></a>of the Altar seven days &amp; at the same time they kept the Feast <a id="l1729"></a>seven days &amp; in the eighth day made a solemn Assembly, &amp; <a id="l1730"></a>on the three &amp; twentieth day of the month which was the ninth day <a id="l1731"></a>Solomon sent the people away 2 Chron. 7.8, 9, 10. The seven <a id="l1732"></a>days of the dedication &amp; seven days of the feast are indeed in <a id="l1733"></a>respect of the different sacrifices of the Dedication &amp; Feast recon<a id="l1734"></a>ed distinctly, &amp; in 1 King. 8.65 summed up as if they were four<a id="l1735"></a>teen days in all. And thô the Hebrew now extant, by reason of its' <a id="l1736"></a>great freedom from various lections, be thought by many to be <a id="l1737"></a>very accurate; yet all the Hebrew copies now extant seem to <a id="l1738"></a>spring from the first edition of the Hebrew with point, &amp; to owe <a id="l1739"></a>their consent with one another to the great care of conserve<a id="l1740"></a>ing &amp; following this edition ever since, whereby the various <a id="l1741"></a>lections of former copies have been lost: &amp; therefore the seventy <a id="l1742"></a>following an earlier &amp; by consequence a more correct <a id="l1743"></a>copy are not always to be despised especially since <a id="l1744"></a>the present Hebrew is inconsistent with  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p043r"> &lt;43r&gt; </span>   it self. For if Israel assembled one the Feast or fifteenth <a id="l1745"></a>day of the month and departed on the three and twentieth day, <a id="l1746"></a>they stayed but eight days at Ierusalem. Nor indeed does the <a id="l1747"></a>fast on the tenth day of the month with its preparation days <a id="l1748"></a>leave room for other seven days of the dedication then those <a id="l1749"></a>of the feast. Tis true the dedication of the Second Temple <a id="l1750"></a>was kept on other days then the Feast of Tabernacles, and <a id="l1751"></a>thence perhaps might the later Iews think it was so in the <a id="l1752"></a>first Temple, and make some marginal notes in their books <a id="l1753"></a>to that purpose which might afterwards creep into the text. <a id="l1754"></a>But their keeping the Dedication eight days with gladness &amp; <a id="l1755"></a>palm branches in their hands as in the feast of Tabernacles <a id="l1756"></a>(2 Mac. 10) is a mark of those Feasts being at first the same. <a id="l1757"></a>So then the seven Vials as well as the seven Trumpets re<a id="l1758"></a>late to the sacrifices of the seven days of the Feast of Ta<a id="l1759"></a>bernacles, and in that respect also they agree and the one <a id="l1760"></a>are a repetition of the other. In every burnt sacrifice when <a id="l1761"></a>the drink offering was poured out the Trumpets began to sound, <a id="l1762"></a>and so they being contemporary circumstances of the same <a id="l1763"></a>sacrifices are fitly used for one another as equipollent em<a id="l1764"></a>blems of those sacrifices, each Angel with his Trumpet <a id="l1765"></a>or Vial being put for the body of all the Priests with their <a id="l1766"></a>Trumpets &amp; Vials who serve on the Temple on the same day. <a id="l1767"></a>For in this prophesy every singular person has his mystical <a id="l1768"></a>body consisting of many persons. And thus the prophesy of the <a id="l1769"></a>Trumpets being by this repetition of it affixed to the solem<a id="l1770"></a>nity of the Feast and Dedication together, is made more <a id="l1771"></a>Emphatical then before; every Trumpet being put for the <a id="l1772"></a>120 Trumpets which sounded on each day of the fast, and <a id="l1773"></a>the sacrifices at which they sounded being the greatest <a id="l1774"></a>that ever were. For sacrifices offered by fire are a type <a id="l1775"></a>of slaughter made by war, and therefore the Trumpets <a id="l1776"></a>sounding seven times to such sacrifices denote seven successive <a id="l1777"></a>courses of war, &amp; these being the seven great plagues of the last <a id="l1778"></a>times wherein is filled up the wrath of God upon his enemies, it was <a id="l1779"></a>fit that they should be represented by the greatest solemnity of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p044r"> &lt;44r&gt; </span>  trumpeting &amp; sacrificing that ever was. And that the prophesy of the Trumpets <a id="l1780"></a>is thus repeated illustrated &amp; improved in that of the vials will further appear by comparing them as follows.</p>

One of these three parts is in the Vials called the Earth, the Sea, the rivers, the Sun,  &amp; in the  Trumpets the third part thereof &amp; the third part of men, &amp; in the prophesy of the Woman &amp; Dragon  the third part of the stars.</p>

<p id="par78">Now whilst the seven trumpets &amp; seven thunders  joyntly represent the musick of the Temple at the sacrifices &amp; the seven plagues &amp; seven vials are the sacrifices themselves with their drink offerings: we are to conceive that the two last do joyntly &amp; severally answer to the two first by way of interpretation.

<p id="par80">In the next place the Prophet is called  unto the mighty Angel of the seven thunders &amp; the Angel gives him the open book to eat &amp; tells him he must prophesy again &amp; then discourses to him about the Nations who tread under foot the Holy City &amp; thereby turn it to a wilderness as Babylon did Zion of old Ier 12.10. Isa. 64.10 &amp; 14.17; &amp; about the two Witnesses in whose days it rained not to fructify the spiritually barren earth of this desolate region; &amp; about the great City of the nations seated where the Lord was crucified, that is in the Wilderness which they had made by laying the Holy City wast; &amp; about the Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit &amp; killeth the witnesses in the streets of that great City Babylon. And all this is plainly repeated in the prophesy of the Angel of the seven Vials who calls the Prophet to him &amp;  carries him away in the spirit into the barren wilderness whether the Holy City represented by the glorious Woman in Heaven was fled by persecution Apoc. 12 &amp; there shews him  many waters which are peoples &amp; multitudes &amp; nations &amp; tongues &amp; the Whore of Babylon that great City sitting on these drunken with the blood of the witnesses of Iesus, &amp; the Beast which ascendeth out of the bottomless pit &amp; makes war with the Lamb; &amp; discourses to him about these things.</p>
<p id="par81">Afterwards  in the Prophesy follows the fall of the tenth part of that  great City, (that is of the City then under one of the ten Kings,) &amp; the slaying of the seven thousand names of men at her fall (that is the dissolution of so many societies) whereat the remnant were affrighted &amp; gave glory to the God of heaven.

Here in comparing the fall of the tenth part of the city <a id="l1851"></a>to the fall of Babylon I conceive the tenth part of the city to signify <a id="l1852"></a>the city under one of the ten Kings. For Babylon falls twice. For the <a id="l1853"></a>ten Kings eat the flesh of the Whore &amp; burn her with fire that con<a id="l1854"></a>sume her riches &amp; destroy her by war, &amp; then the tenth part of <a id="l1855"></a>the city falls by the Euphratean horsmen. For with its fall the second wo <a id="l1856"></a>concludes, proclamation being then made that the second wo is past &amp; there<a id="l1857"></a>fore its fall is a part of the second wo &amp; consequently effected by the <a id="l1858"></a>Euphratean horsmen. And to signify this double fall of the great city <a id="l1859"></a>'tis every where proclaimed twice saying Babylon is fallen is fallen <a id="l1860"></a>Apoc. 14.8 &amp; 19.2. To which double fall answers a double conversion <a id="l1861"></a>of the people, the first at the resurrection or ascention of the witnesses the last at the <a id="l1862"></a>fall of the tenth part of the Great City.

It begins therefore with the seventh <a id="l1884"></a>head, &amp; ascent of the Beast out of the Abyss or sea, that is with the opening of <a id="l1885"></a>of seventh seale, &amp; consequently with the measuring of the Temple &amp; Altar <a id="l1886"></a>&amp; so is synchronal to that prophesy of the Temple &amp; altar &amp; two Witnesses <a id="l1887"></a>from the beginning to the end.</p>

For he is the eight King &amp; of the seven, <a id="l1901"></a>being a collateral part of the seventh. And so on the contrary when <a id="l1902"></a>it may be truly said of the Beast that he was &amp; is not &amp; yet is, then <a id="l1903"></a>it is to be understood of the heads that five are fallen &amp; one is. Now <a id="l1904"></a>all sober Interpreters take the saying that the Beast was &amp; is not to <a id="l1905"></a>relate not to the days of the Prophet, but to the future vicissitudes <a id="l1906"></a>of the Beast &amp; to be only a character of the Beast in respect of <a id="l1907"></a>his being at sometime or other wounded to death with a sword &amp; <a id="l1908"></a>reviving.  This wound they seek for long after the days of the <a id="l1909"></a>Prophet, &amp; therefore they are also upon the same grounds to seek <a id="l1910"></a>for the sixt head of the Beast long after those days. When the Lamb <a id="l1911"></a>has opened the last seale of the prophetick book, then begin the times of <a id="l1912"></a>prophesying out of it in the visions: &amp; therefore this Angel considers the <a id="l1913"></a>times of the sixt seale as present that his prophesying may respect the times <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p047r"> &lt;47r&gt; </span> of the seventh as next to come.

<p id="par86">The sealed prophesy alluding to the sanctuary &amp; worship therein, <a id="l1916"></a>'tis reasonable to expect that the history alluded unto in the interpretation <a id="l1917"></a>should be the history of the sanctuary.  Now the sanctuary was threefold, <a id="l1918"></a>the Tabernacle, the first Temple built by Solomon, &amp; the second Temple <a id="l1919"></a>built by Zerubbabel &amp; to these three belong a threefold history: <a id="l1920"></a>to the first that of Israel's passing out of Egypt through the wilderness <a id="l1921"></a>into the promised land of Canaan, to the second that of the ten tribes <a id="l1922"></a>revolting &amp; Israel &amp; Iudah growing Idolatrous; to the third that of <a id="l1923"></a>the Babylonian captivity.  In the interpretation all these are alluded unto.  <a id="l1924"></a>For the two witnesses or Prophets in being called two Candlesticks &amp; two <a id="l1925"></a>olive trees respect the prophesy of Zechary chap. 4, &amp; so allude to <a id="l1926"></a>Zerubbabel &amp; Ieshua &amp; to Haggai &amp; Zechary who prophesyed at the <a id="l1927"></a>building of the second Temple; in their devouring their enemies by fire <a id="l1928"></a>proceeding as it were out of their mouths, &amp; in causing that it rain not <a id="l1929"></a>in the 1260 days of their prophesy they allude to Elijah &amp; Elisha who  prophesied in the time of the first Temple, &amp; at whose word their enemies were devoured by fire &amp; it rained not for<sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n48-ref">[48]</sup> three years &amp; an half. &amp; in their <a id="l1931"></a>turning the waters to blood &amp; smiting the earth with a curs as oft as <a id="l1932"></a>they will they allude to Moses &amp; Aaron who turned the waters into <a id="l1933"></a>blood in the first Egyptian plague &amp; in the other nine smote Egypt as <a id="l1934"></a>often as they would, &amp; erected the Tabernacles.  And so in the <a id="l1935"></a>repetition of this prophesy, the great whore in being called Babylon <a id="l1936"></a>respects the times of the Babylonian captivity &amp; second Temple,  <a id="l1937"></a>in being compared to the merchandising city of Tyre respects <a id="l1938"></a>the time of the first Temple, &amp; in being placed in the wilderness <a id="l1939"></a>respects time of Israels committing spiritual fornication <a id="l1940"></a>in the wilderness in the time of the Tabernacle.  I shall begin <a id="l1941"></a>with the history of the Tabernacle.</p>
<p id="par87">A dragon is in sacred prophesy the <em class="underline">great dragon that lyeth in the midst <a id="l1942"></a>of his river</em>.<sup class="note" id="n49-ref">[49]</sup>  and in another place he is compared to a Dragon <a id="l1943"></a>in the sea who troubleth the waters of other Nations with his feet.  <a id="l1944"></a>And Isaiah thus describes the coming of Israel out of Egypt:<sup class="note" id="n50-ref">[50]</sup> <em class="underline">Art <a id="l1945"></a>not thou he that hath cut Rahab</em> (that is <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n51-ref">[51]</sup> Egypt) <em class="underline">in pieces &amp; wounded <a id="l1946"></a>the Dragon?  Art not thou he which dried the sea - for the ransomed <a id="l1947"></a>people to pass over</em>?  And in the Psalms the coming of the Church out <a id="l1948"></a>of Egypt &amp; making a pray of the drowned Egyptians is thus exprest.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p048r"> &lt;48r&gt; </span>  <em class="underline">Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength, thou breakest the heads of the <a id="l1949"></a>Dragons in the waters, thou breakest the heads of Leviathan in pieces <a id="l1950"></a>&amp; gavest him to be meat to thy people inhabiting the wilderness</em>.</p>
<p id="par88">Now to this history of many headed Egyptian Leviathan, does <a id="l1951"></a>the parable of the seven headed Dragon allude.  The woman in heaven <a id="l1952"></a>crowned with a crown of twelve stars, seeing she was persecuted by <a id="l1953"></a>the Dragon &amp; her seed kept the Commandments of God &amp; had the testi<a id="l1954"></a>mony of Iesus (Apoc. 12.13, 17) is the Church crowned with the twelve Apos<a id="l1955"></a>tles, &amp; alludes to the Church of Israel in bondage crowned with the twelve Apostles, &amp; alludes to the Church of Israel in bondage crowned with the <a id="l1956"></a>twelve Princes of the Tribes Num. 1.16.  For crying in pains of travail <a id="l1957"></a>alludes to the Church afflicted in Egypt &amp; Fruitfull under bondage.  <a id="l1958"></a>The Dragon's standing before her ready to devour her child as soon <a id="l1959"></a>as it was born, alludes to Pharaoh's command to slay the new born <a id="l1960"></a>men children of Israel.  The Man child she bare who was to rule <a id="l1961"></a>all nations with a rod of iron, to new born Moses who was to rule <a id="l1962"></a>Israel with his rod.  The childs being caught up to God's throne, to <a id="l1963"></a>Moses his being delivered from eminent death by Pharaohs daughter <a id="l1964"></a>&amp; made Ruler over Israel.  The war wherein Michael overcame <a id="l1965"></a>the Dragon &amp; the Dragon with his Angels were cast out of heaven, to the <a id="l1966"></a>contest wherein Moses by the power of God overcame the magical <a id="l1967"></a>powers of Egypt, &amp; as it were cast them out of Pharohs court, <a id="l1968"></a>so that the Magicians could not stand before him.  After that victory <a id="l1969"></a>the woman fled from the Dragon &amp; Israel from Egypt, both of them <a id="l1970"></a>into the wilderness, &amp; both of them on Eagles wings, Exod. 19.4, Deut. 32.11. <a id="l1971"></a>Apoc. 12.14  and <a id="l1972"></a>both of them through the sea:  For in allusion thereto are the people <a id="l1973"></a>of the Apocalyptic woman now called inhabitants of both earth &amp; <a id="l1974"></a>sea Apoc. 12.12.  Then as the Dragon cast out waters as a flood (that <a id="l1975"></a>is an hostile multitude) after the woman, &amp; the earth opened her mouth <a id="l1976"></a>&amp; swallowed up the waters, so Egypt sent out an Army after the <a id="l1977"></a>Church of Israel &amp; the earth opened her mouth the alveus or pit <a id="l1978"></a>pit of the red sea dried up, &amp; swallowed up those waters.  If you conceive the flood to be swallowed up at the right foot of the mighty Angel, as it were into the sea of glass, the mouth of the earth will answer better to the abyss of the red sea.  For as every sea is an abyss or mouth of the earth, so the round cavity of the sea of glass may be fitly considered as such.  Further the woman <a id="l1979"></a>fled into the wilderness that they should feed her there 1260 days, &amp; <a id="l1980"></a>so Israel was fed a long time in the wilderness with manna.  Then <a id="l1981"></a>rise up the ten horned Beast with crowns upon his horns, &amp; the two <a id="l1982"></a>horned Beast uncrowned, which are afterwards called the Beast &amp; <a id="l1983"></a>fals Prophet, &amp; this fals Prophet dictates that an Image be made <a id="l1984"></a>to the crowned Beast &amp; gives life to the Image that it should be worshipped, <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p049r"> &lt;49r&gt; </span>  &amp; in like manner when the Church of Israel was in the wilderness, <a id="l1985"></a>there arose Balac a King with his confederates, &amp; Balaam a fals <a id="l1986"></a>Prophet, &amp; by the counsel of that fals Prophet the Israelites were <a id="l1987"></a>induced to worship the Idol of Balac called Baal-Peor: whence <a id="l1988"></a>the Beast &amp; fals Prophet are in the Epistle to the Church of Pergamus <a id="l1989"></a>called Balac &amp; Balaam as shall be explained hereafter.  The <a id="l1990"></a>beast by his many crowned horns signifies an aggregate of <a id="l1991"></a>several Kingdoms, &amp; so against Israel conspired a body of many <a id="l1992"></a>Kings; viz. Balac King of  Moab &amp; Evi, Rekein, Zur, Hur, <a id="l1993"></a>Reba, five Kings of Midian.  In the wilderness the whore commits <a id="l1994"></a>fornication with the Kings of the earth, &amp; lives deliciously with them, <a id="l1995"></a>&amp; so the people of Israel in the wilderness commit spiritual forni<a id="l1996"></a>cation with the Kings of Midian &amp; feast on the sacrifices of their Gods Num. <a id="l1997"></a>25.1, 2, &amp; 31.16.  Afterwards the armies in heaven make war upon the <a id="l1998"></a>Beast &amp; Kings of the Earth &amp; in those wars the Beast &amp; fals Prophet <a id="l1999"></a>are first taken &amp; destroyed, &amp; the rest slain with the two edged sword of <a id="l2000"></a>Iesus Christ, &amp; the saints under his conduct enter into the promised King<a id="l2001"></a>dom &amp; reign with him: &amp; to Israel in their entrance into the land <a id="l2002"></a>of promise first made war upon the Kings of Midian &amp; destroyed them <a id="l2003"></a>&amp; their people together with the fals Prophet Balaam, &amp; then by the <a id="l2004"></a>sword of Ioshua or Iesus vanquished the Kings of Canaan worshippers <a id="l2005"></a>also of Baal &amp; under his conduct entred into the promised land of <a id="l2006"></a>Canaan.  Thus full are the allusions of this prophesy to the passage <a id="l2007"></a>of Israel out of Egypt into Canaan.  Some little differences there <a id="l2008"></a>are in their circumstances: but it is not necessary that similitudes <a id="l2009"></a>&amp; allusions should agree in all points with the things alluded to.  In an <a id="l2010"></a>allusion nothing more is required then an agreement in the main.</p>
<p id="par89">In the next place we are to consider the allusions to sacred history in the <a id="l2011"></a>times of the first Temple.  In respect of these times the two witnesses (as <a id="l2012"></a>we said) are compared to Elijah &amp; Elishah &amp; the whore of Babylon that great <a id="l2013"></a>city to the Idolatrous merchandizing city of Tyre.  Whence the Apostacy of <a id="l2014"></a>the Church of Israel to the worship of Baal is in these times alluded unto.  <a id="l2015"></a>For of all their apostacies this was the greatest, &amp; Baal being the God of <a id="l2016"></a>the Canaanites or Phœnecians, where of Tyre &amp; Zidon were the head cities, <a id="l2017"></a>the whore that great City who tempted Gods people to Idolatry is fitly re<a id="l2018"></a>presented by Tyre the greatest of the cities of the Canaanites.  For in de<a id="l2019"></a>scribing the fall of  Babylon the merchandize &amp; fall of Tyre is <a id="l2020"></a>in many things alluded unto.  The inhabitants of Zidon &amp; Arrad were <a id="l2021"></a>the Mariners of Tyre, &amp; all the ships of the sea with their Mariners were employed <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p050r"> &lt;50r&gt; </span>  in her merchandize, &amp; the Men of Tarshish, Iavan, Tulal, Meshach, the <a id="l2022"></a>house of Tagarmah, the Isles Syria, Iudah, Damascus, Iavan, Dedan, <a id="l2023"></a>Arabia, Sheba, Raasnah, Haran, Canneh, Eden, Ashur, Chilmad were<a id="l2024"></a>her Merchants Ezek. 23, &amp; in general the merchants of Tyre were <a id="l2025"></a>Princes, &amp; her <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Trafickers<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the honourable of the earth Isa. 23.8, &amp; so <a id="l2026"></a>were those of the great city the Whore Apoc. 18.23.  The merchandize <a id="l2027"></a>of Tyre was of all kinds of Riches, Gold &amp; Silver, &amp; all precious <a id="l2028"></a>stones, &amp; <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n52-ref">[52]</sup> pearles, &amp; find linnen, &amp; purple, &amp; embroidered work, &amp; <a id="l2029"></a>Silk, &amp; Ebony &amp; Ivory, &amp; Chests of Cedar, &amp; vessels of brass and <a id="l2030"></a>bright iron, &amp; <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>cassia<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; all sweet smelling spices &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n53-ref">[53]</sup> balsom &amp; wine <a id="l2031"></a>&amp; oyl, &amp; wheat, &amp; Lambs, &amp; rams, &amp; horses, &amp; cloathes for Chariots, <a id="l2032"></a>&amp; horsmen, &amp; souls of Men Ezek. 27, &amp; such also was the Merchandize <a id="l2033"></a>of the great city Apoc. 18.12. 13.  Tyre filled many people &amp; enriched <a id="l2034"></a>the Kings of the earth with the multitude of her riches &amp; of her merchan<a id="l2035"></a>dize Ezek. 27.33, &amp; so did the great city Apoc. 18.3, 15, 19.

Also the Mariners &amp; Priests of the <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>sea<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> came <a id="l2044"></a>down from <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>their ships<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; stood upon the sand, &amp; cast <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>ash<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> on their heads, <a id="l2045"></a>&amp; lamented over her, saying, What city is like Tyrus the destroyed in <a id="l2046"></a>in midst of the sea Ezek. 27.29, 32, &amp; the like to the shipmakers and <a id="l2047"></a>Mariners, &amp; all that trade by sea at the foot of the great city Apoc. 18.17, <a id="l2048"></a>18, 19.  And least it should be said that Tyre is not in scripture repre<a id="l2049"></a>sented a Whore like the great city; Isaiah has thus remove the objection: <a id="l2050"></a><em class="underline">It shall come to pass</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">in that day that Tyre shall be forgotten <a id="l2051"></a>seventy years, according to the days of one King:</em> after the end of se<a id="l2052"></a>venty years shall Tyre sing as an harlot, Take an harp, go about the city, thou <a id="l2053"></a>harlot that hast been forgotten, make sweet melody, sing many songs, that <a id="l2054"></a>thou maist be remembred.  And it shall come to pass after the end of se<a id="l2055"></a>venty years, that the Lord will visit Tyre, &amp; she shall turn to her hire, &amp; shall com<a id="l2056"></a>mit fornication with all the Kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.  <a id="l2057"></a>And her Merchandise, &amp; her hire shall be holiness to the Lord: it shall <a id="l2058"></a>not be treasured, nor laid up: for her merchandize shall be for them <a id="l2059"></a><em class="underline">that dwell before the Lord to eat sufficiently, &amp; for durable cloathing</em> <a id="l2060"></a>Ch. 23.15, 16, 17, 18.  How all this can litterally agre to old Tyre, I must confess, <a id="l2061"></a>I do not see; but if it agree to the great city, 'tis more to our purpose.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p051r"> &lt;51r&gt; </span>  Nor is there any great difficulty in the 70 years, the great city being <a id="l2062"></a>the seven hilled city which in the time that Prophet Iohn reigned over the <a id="l2063"></a>Kings of the earth Apoc. 17.9, 18, &amp; there being an interregnum <a id="l2064"></a>of 70 years between the desolation of that city in the wars of Belisa<a id="l2065"></a>rius, whereby her old imperial government under the Senate &amp; Consuls <a id="l2066"></a>fell, &amp; the setting up her new dominion of the universal Bishopric <a id="l2067"></a>by the grant of the Emperour Phocas.</p>
<p id="par90">The worship of Baal the God of the Canaanites was set up in <a id="l2068"></a>Israel in the reign of Ahab by the influence of Iezabel daughter <a id="l2069"></a>of the King of Zidon, &amp; lasted till the reign of Iehu.  Iezabel <a id="l2070"></a>reigning all that while in Israel.  And hence the great whore is <a id="l2071"></a>also called Iezabel, as you may see in the Epistle to the Church of <a id="l2072"></a>Thyatira.  For there Iezabel is represented to call herself a <a id="l2073"></a>Prophetess, &amp; to teach &amp; seduce God's servants (that is by prophesying <a id="l2074"></a>falsly) to commit fornication, &amp; to eat things sacrificed to Idols, <a id="l2075"></a>&amp; therefore that fornication is spiritual, such as is that of the whore <a id="l2076"></a>of Babylon.  For carnal whores tempt their Lovers by other <a id="l2077"></a>arts then prophesying.  Iezabel was a whore &amp; a Queen, and <a id="l2078"></a>reigned over the ten Tribes all the time of their worshipping <a id="l2079"></a>Baal, &amp; seduced the people by her witchcrafts Apoc. 2.20 &amp; <a id="l2080"></a>2 Kings 9.22) &amp; sew the Prophets of the Lord &amp; in all these <a id="l2081"></a>things answers to the whore of Babylon who committed forni<a id="l2082"></a>cation with the Kings of the earth sat a Queen &amp; reigned over <a id="l2083"></a>the ten horned Beast, &amp; deceived all nations by her sorceries, <a id="l2084"></a>&amp; in whom was found the blood of Prophets, &amp; of saints, &amp; of all that <a id="l2085"></a> were slain upon the earth.</p>
<p id="par91">While Iezabel seduced the ten tribes her daughter Athaliah <a id="l2086"></a>the Grandchild of Omri seduced the two tribes to the same worship.  <a id="l2087"></a>For she caused her husband Iehoram &amp; her son Ahaziah Kings <a id="l2088"></a>of Iudah to walk in all the ways of the house of her father Ahab, <a id="l2089"></a>&amp; caused Baal to be worshipped in Iudah till the time of her death <a id="l2090"></a>2 Kings 8. &amp; 2 Chron. 21 &amp; 22 &amp; 23.  And this general defection <a id="l2091"></a>of Israel and Iudah is alluded unto in the sealing of only an <a id="l2092"></a>hundred &amp; forty four thousand out of all the twelve tribes of <a id="l2093"></a>Israel.  And as the Idolatrous twelve tribes were distinguished <a id="l2094"></a>into two tribes the ten tribes under Iezabel, &amp; the two tribes <a id="l2095"></a>under Athaliah; so the twelve tribes in the Apocalyps are distin<a id="l2096"></a>guished into the ten horned Beast under the whore &amp; the two <a id="l2097"></a>horned Beast.  For the ten tribes are alluded unto in the ten <a id="l2098"></a>horned Beast, not only by calling the whore Iezabel, but also by <a id="l2099"></a>comparing the wilderness where the Beast reigned to the Kingdom <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p052r"> &lt;52r&gt; </span> of Israel under Ahab in saying that  it rained not there in the days of the <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>prophesies<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of the two <a id="l2100"></a>witnesses: &amp; the two tribes were alluded unto <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>by the two<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> horned <a id="l2101"></a>Beast, as I gather from its being called <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>the synagogue<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of Satan <a id="l2102"></a>who say they are Iews &amp; are not but do lye.

<p id="par93">Now as old Babylon is alluded unto in this great city, so the <a id="l2133"></a>analogy between them is very full.

Ier. 51.63.  <a id="l2165"></a>In all these circumstances Babylon is alluded to in the description of <a id="l2166"></a>the Whore.  She reigns over the Kingdoms of the earth, is arrayed in <a id="l2167"></a>scarlet &amp; decked with Gold &amp; precious stones, sits in a wilderness <a id="l2168"></a>upon many waters, abounds in treasures, is a great Idolatress, <a id="l2169"></a>makes the Nations drunken with her cup of wine, her sins reach <a id="l2170"></a>up to heaven, &amp; according to her deeds she is to be rewarded.

And Babylon is thus alluded in the prophesy <a id="l2177"></a>as the Whore both Babylon &amp; the whore are in most of these things <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p054r"> &lt;54r&gt; </span>  alluded to in describing that great city where the witnesses are slain. Apoc. 11.  She has the Beast &amp; peoples &amp; kindreds &amp; tongue &amp; Nations within <a id="l2178"></a>the dition &amp; dominion of her streets.  For there they kill &amp; view the <a id="l2179"></a>witnesses.  She sits upon waters, the waters which the two witnesses turn <a id="l2180"></a>into blood; which waters are those peoples, kindreds, tongues &amp; Nations <a id="l2181"></a>Apoc. 17.  She is in a region where it rains not &amp; which is therefore <a id="l2182"></a>barren like a wilderness.  Her fall like Babylons is proclaimed <a id="l2183"></a>immediately before the Kingdomes of the world become the Kingdoms <a id="l2184"></a>of Christ, in saying the tenth part of the city fell: &amp; before her fall <a id="l2185"></a>the witnesses call many people out of her so as to ascend up to <a id="l2186"></a>heaven in a cloud of believers.</p>
<p id="par94">These great cities agree also in lasciviousness &amp; uncleanness <a id="l2187"></a>&amp; in their ruin.  For the great city here to <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>express<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> her land unclean<a id="l2188"></a>ness to the hight &amp; her perishing by fire is called Sodom.

Feasting <a id="l2200"></a>recreations are the singular delight of Kings &amp; Nobles throughout <a id="l2201"></a>all Persia: but chiefly the Babylonians are addicted to wine &amp; <a id="l2202"></a>those things which follow drunkenness.  The habit of their weomen <a id="l2203"></a>in feasts is at first modest,  then they put of their upper garments <a id="l2204"></a>&amp; by degrees profane their modesty &amp; at last throw way the <a id="l2205"></a>undermost covering of their body, stripping themselves stark <a id="l2206"></a>naked.

<p id="par95">Conceive therefore that the great city as it is distinguished <a id="l2214"></a>from the Beast &amp; represented by a great whore riding upon him <a id="l2215"></a>alludes to the Weomen of Babylon reigning over the hearts of Princes  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p055r"> &lt;55r&gt; </span>  by the influence of their whoredomes &amp; love-cup wherewith they <a id="l2216"></a>inebriate the people in feasting; &amp; that the Beast with his ten horns <a id="l2217"></a>or kingdomes alludes to the temporal Kingdome of Babylon com<a id="l2218"></a>pacted of many Nations or Kingdoms called Beasts of the field <a id="l2219"></a>Ier. 27.6, 7 &amp; 28.14 one Beast with many horns in the Apocalyps <a id="l2220"></a>being put for those many Beasts; &amp; that the worshipping of this Beast <a id="l2221"></a>alludes to the divine worship which those Nations paid to the Kings <a id="l2222"></a>of Babylon &amp; Persia.  For they worshipped their Kings with divine <a id="l2223"></a>worship as Gods falling prostrate on their faces before them.  Whence <a id="l2224"></a>Arrianus (lib. 7 Exped. Alexand.) saith that Alexander the great would <a id="l2225"></a>be worshipped as a God in compliance with the Persian custome.  And <a id="l2226"></a>Cleo Siculus (as Q. Curtius lib. 8 relates) in persuading the Greeks <a id="l2227"></a>to imitate the Persians in worshipping Alexander the great as a God, <a id="l2228"></a>useth this argument, that the Persians did not only piously but also <a id="l2229"></a>prudently in worshipping their Kings amongst the Gods: because the <a id="l2230"></a>majesty of Empire is the Princes safegard.  And when the Emperour <a id="l2231"></a>Domitian had arrogated to himself divine honours &amp; was dead Mar<a id="l2232"></a>tial in the 22<sup>th</sup> Epigramm of his 10<sup>th</sup> book banishes such worship of <a id="l2233"></a>Kings from among the Romans to the Persians so Isocrates in his <a id="l2234"></a>Panegyric inveighs against the Persians for worshipping a mortal <a id="l2235"></a>man as a God, &amp; thereby conceiving amiss of the God more then <a id="l2236"></a>of Men.  And Quintus Curtius (lib. 8. c. 6) saith of Darius, Rex curru <a id="l2237"></a>paulo auta vectus &amp; Deorum a suis honoribus cultus.  And Æschylus <a id="l2238"></a>saith that the Persians had their Kings in the place of Gods.  And the Author <a id="l2239"></a>of the story of Iudeth makes a decree that all nations should worship <a id="l2240"></a>Nebuchodnosor only &amp; call upon him as God Iudeth. 3.8.  And when <a id="l2241"></a>King Ahasuerus set Haman in his own seat &amp; commanded he should <a id="l2242"></a>be worshipped &amp; Mordecai refused to do it; Iosephus (lib. 11. Antic. c. 6) <a id="l2243"></a>saith that he refused to give Haman that worship that he gave to God.  <a id="l2244"></a>And Mordecai himself (in the Apocryphal book of Ester ch. 13) saith <a id="l2245"></a>that he refused to worship Haman that he might not prefer the glory <a id="l2246"></a>of Man before the glory of God, &amp; because he would not worship <a id="l2247"></a>any but God.  And to the same purpose it is that Nebuchadnezzar when <a id="l2248"></a>he would honour Daniel as a great man, fell on his face &amp; wor<a id="l2249"></a>shipped him, &amp; commanded that they should offer an oblation of sweet <a id="l2250"></a>odours unto him.  Daniel. 2.46.  Conceive also that the Image of the <a id="l2251"></a>Beast, whose worship was enjoyned upon pain of death, alludes to <a id="l2252"></a>the great golden Image which Nebuchadnessar sett up in the province <a id="l2253"></a>of Babylon for the peoples &amp; nations &amp; the languages upon pain of death <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p056r"> &lt;56r&gt; </span>    Lastly conceive that the two horned Beast or fals Prophet (opposed to the two true <a id="l2254"></a>Prophets &amp; so contemporary to them) alludes to the Chaldeans or Ba<a id="l2255"></a>bylonian Priests, who were generally educated in Astrology and <a id="l2256"></a>Magick, the science whereof as divine they wrapt up in Tables of <a id="l2257"></a>the Gods to magnifie it, &amp; by these factitious ways of prophesying <a id="l2258"></a>&amp; southsaying sett up &amp; promoted the heathen Idolatry of the <a id="l2259"></a>starrs Elements &amp; Men under the Names of Gods, &amp; particularly <a id="l2260"></a>the worship of Nebuchadnessars Image Dan. 3.8, besides the lewd &amp; most unclean practices of the weomen in the Temple of Venus &amp; <a id="l2261"></a>other places.  For they being the Priests of those Gods &amp; getting a <a id="l2262"></a>livelihood thereby, were induced out of interest to use all kinds <a id="l2263"></a>of fals &amp; cheating Arts &amp; tricks to keep up and promote the <a id="l2264"></a>heathen Idolatry.</p>
<p id="par96">In describing these allusions I take it for granted that the <a id="l2265"></a>two ten horned Beasts in the Apocal. ch. 13 &amp; 17 are the same.  For <a id="l2266"></a>they agree in their heads &amp; horns.  The one was wounded to <a id="l2267"></a>death with a sword &amp; revived, the other was &amp; is not &amp; shall ascend.  <a id="l2268"></a>The one rises out of the sea, the other out of the Abyss not out <a id="l2269"></a>of the deep well which was locked up Apoc. 9 but out of an open <a id="l2270"></a>Abyss, which may be taken for the sea.  The one has on his head the <a id="l2271"></a>Names of blasphemy, &amp; the other is full of the Names of blasphemy.  <a id="l2272"></a>The one all the world wondred after &amp; worshipped the other all <a id="l2273"></a>whose Names are not written in the book of life wondred after.  The one <a id="l2274"></a>was in being at the end of the 1200 days Apoc. 11.3, 7, 8 outlived <a id="l2275"></a>the Whore or great city Ch. 17.16 &amp; soon after perished, the Kingdoms <a id="l2276"></a>of this world becoming the Kingdoms of Christ, &amp; those being de<a id="l2277"></a>stroyed who destroyed the earth Ch. 11.15, 18: the other reigned <a id="l2278"></a>the 1260 days or 42 Months Ch. 13.5 &amp; perished also soon after <a id="l2279"></a>the fall of the great city Ch. 14.9, 10, 19 &amp; 19.2, 20.  They are <a id="l2280"></a>therefore alike &amp; universal &amp; contemporary &amp; perish together <a id="l2281"></a>&amp; so must be the same.  All the difference is that in the 13<sup>th</sup> Chapter <a id="l2282"></a>the Beast is described in  in his <a id="l2283"></a>first rise &amp; reign before the woman got upon his back, &amp; in the <a id="l2284"></a>17<sup>th</sup> Chapter he is described in the time of her reign over <a id="l2285"></a>him.  Lastly that they are the same is certain by this that the one <a id="l2286"></a>together with the Kings of the Earth makes war against the King of <a id="l2287"></a>Kings &amp; Lord of Lords riding on the white horse, &amp; against his army <a id="l2288"></a>&amp; perishes in the war Apoc. 19 &amp; the other is that Beast who with his horns <a id="l2289"></a>or Kings makes war with the same King of Kings &amp; Lord of Lords, &amp; with <a id="l2290"></a>them that are with him, &amp; is overcome in the war Apoc. 17.</p>

<p id="par97"><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p057r"> &lt;57r&gt; </span> By what has been said it is manifest that in the same parts of the Apoca<a id="l2291"></a>lyps several histories of the sanctuary are together alluded unto.  How <a id="l2292"></a>in the prophesies of the two witnesses &amp; whore of Babylon the histories <a id="l2293"></a>of all three sanctuaries are alluded unto has been already explained.  <a id="l2294"></a>So the prophesy of numbring &amp; sealing the servants of God out of <a id="l2295"></a>all the twelve tribes in respect of Ezekiels vision of marking those <a id="l2296"></a>who sigh &amp; mourn for the abominations done in the midst of Israel, <a id="l2297"></a>alludes to the times of the Babylonian captivity &amp; second Temple; in <a id="l2298"></a>respect of the number of twelve tribes it alludes to the times of the <a id="l2299"></a>first Temple or Tabernacles whom all the tribes were together; <a id="l2300"></a>&amp; in respect of the Scape Goat, representing the flight of the woman <a id="l2301"></a>into the wilderness it alludes to the times of Tabernacle.  So the <a id="l2302"></a>prophesy of the two Beasts &amp; the Image of the Beast in respect of <a id="l2303"></a>the woman flying into the wilderness &amp; being afterwards found <a id="l2304"></a>there with the ten horned Beast, the history of Israel, Balac, Balaam, <a id="l2305"></a>&amp; the Idols of Baal Peor in the wilderness, in respect of the 144000 <a id="l2306"></a>on Mount Sion &amp; the twelve horns of the two Beasts together, &amp; <a id="l2307"></a>Iezabel reigning over the ten tribes it alludes to the Prophets &amp; <a id="l2308"></a>saints selected out of all the twelve tribes, &amp; the division of those <a id="l2309"></a>tribes into the Kingdoms or Churches of the ten tribes &amp; two tribes <a id="l2310"></a>&amp; their worshipping Baal in the time of the first Temple; &amp; in <a id="l2311"></a>respect of the worship given to the Beast &amp; his Image &amp; the whore <a id="l2312"></a>of Babylon riding upon him it respects the Babylonian Empire in <a id="l2313"></a>the line of the captivity &amp; second Temple.  And so the prophesy of <a id="l2314"></a>the seven Thunders in the Victors standing upon a Sea of Glass &amp; <a id="l2315"></a>singing the song of Moses alludes to Israel coming out of Egypt <a id="l2316"></a><span class="gap" title="Text is illegible because the manuscript is faint">{illeg}</span> the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n56-ref">[56]</sup> frozen sea &amp; singing the song of Moses at the drowning <a id="l2317"></a>of the Egyptians, &amp; in the seven Angels coming out of the Temple, <a id="l2318"></a>&amp; the Temples being filled with smoke while they poured out their <a id="l2319"></a>Vials it alludes both to the Dedication of Solomons Temple &amp; <a id="l2320"></a>to the <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible because the manuscript is faint">{illeg}</span>d remaining upon the Tabernacle from the time of <a id="l2321"></a>its dedication all the while Israel was in the wilderness.

<p id="par98">By what has been hitherto said, much light is given to the <a id="l2341"></a>rise, number, &amp; qualities of the Apocalyptic persons.  These at <a id="l2342"></a>first are only two, the Dragon &amp; the woman in heaven cloathed <a id="l2343"></a>with the sun, that is the Kingdome prophesied of from the beginning <a id="l2344"></a>&amp; the true Church diffused through that Kingdome.  Afterwards by <a id="l2345"></a>division of that Kingdome conjoyned with an Apostacy, they become <a id="l2346"></a>six; two Kingdoms each with their proper Churches as well fals <a id="l2347"></a>as true.  These Kingdoms are the Dragon &amp; ten horned Beast &amp; their fals Churches , the two horned Beast <a id="l2348"></a>&amp; woman in the wilderness.    For Churches are the <a id="l2349"></a>Churches of Kingdoms, &amp; according to the number &amp; bounds of <a id="l2350"></a>Kingdoms are numbred &amp; bounded.  [The Catholick Church is <a id="l2351"></a>distributed into particular hierarchies according to the number <a id="l2352"></a>of Kingdoms, provinces, &amp; cities through which it is diffused, but <a id="l2353"></a>the first &amp; principal division is according to the number of <a id="l2354"></a>Kingdoms. This Prophesy was given for the use of Christians &amp; <a id="l2355"></a>respects no other Kingdoms then such as have to <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>do<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> with the Church, <a id="l2356"></a>&amp; all such Kingdoms have their Churches, &amp; therefore the colla<a id="l2357"></a>teral Kingdoms of the Dragon &amp; Beast must have theirs.]</p>
<h2 id="hd22" class="cent">The division of the Kingdome &amp; it's church</h2>
<p id="par99">The division of the whole Kingdome signified by the great red <a id="l2358"></a>Dragon into two collateral parts, called afterwards the Dragon &amp; <a id="l2359"></a>Beast, is described by the Beasts rising out of the sea &amp; the Dragon's <a id="l2360"></a>giving him his throne &amp; power &amp; great authority.  For <a id="l2361"></a>thence it <a id="l2362"></a>appears that the Beast rejoyned in that seat or throne which was the Dragon's <a id="l2363"></a>before, &amp; consequently was a part of the Dragon's old Kingdome.  Not <a id="l2364"></a>the whore but a part, for the Dragon did not thereupon cease.  He <a id="l2365"></a>was from that time worshipped together with the Beast Apoc. 13.4, <a id="l2366"></a>&amp; at length when one frog came out of the Beasts mouth another <a id="l2367"></a>came out of the Dragon's, &amp; when the Beast is cast into the lake of fire <a id="l2368"></a>the Dragon is cast into the bottomless pitt.  They continued therefore <a id="l2369"></a>both together till the end, &amp; therefore <a id="l2370"></a>both together till the end, &amp; therefore were two collateral King<a id="l2371"></a>doms propagated from the Dragons old Kingdome by divisions.  When <a id="l2372"></a>the Dragon was dethroned by Michael, he came down to reign <a id="l2373"></a>amongst the inhabitants of the Earth &amp; sea.  Out of this sea rose <a id="l2374"></a>the Beast.  The Earth remained to the Dragon.  For which reason it is <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p060r"> &lt;60r&gt; </span>  represented that at that moment of time when the Beast rose out of the sea, <a id="l2375"></a>the Dragon stood upon the sand of the sea, that is upon the earth.  The <a id="l2376"></a>Beast is not said to leave the inhabitants of the sea &amp; come upon the <a id="l2377"></a>land to the Dragon for so he would leave his Kingdom which is all one with himself: but the Dragon stands upon the shore to give <a id="l2378"></a>his marine dominion &amp; throne to the Beast in the sea, &amp; so both <a id="l2379"></a>continue in their proper regions for the future.  This is that earth <a id="l2380"></a>&amp; sa whose Mountains &amp; Islands  {in the  sixt seale &amp; seventh Vial <a id="l2381"></a>are moved out of their places, &amp; on which the Angel with the open book <a id="l2382"></a>in his hand sets his feet, &amp; which were smitten in the two first trumpets &amp; vials. </p>
<p id="par100">So then the Dragon &amp; Beast are one &amp; the same Kingdom branch<a id="l2389"></a>ed into two, &amp; this is further intimated by their having common <a id="l2390"></a>heads &amp; horns.  The Dragons heads &amp; Beasts horns are crowned to <a id="l2391"></a>signify that the Dragon reigns in all the heads &amp; the Beast in all the horns.  The <a id="l2392"></a>Beast has the same heads without crowns to signify that the body of the Beast <a id="l2393"></a>was conteined in the reigning Dragon from the beginning though not <a id="l2394"></a>actually divided from him so as to reign distinctly before he rose <a id="l2395"></a>out of the Sea.  And the Dragon has the same horns without crowns to <a id="l2396"></a>signify that those horns once belonged to his body but reigned not ac<a id="l2397"></a>tually before the Beast became divided from him.  And this is fur<a id="l2398"></a>ther confirmed by the Angels interpretation of the Beasts heads &amp; horns.  <a id="l2399"></a>The heads, saith he, are seven Kings, five are fallen, &amp; one is, &amp; <a id="l2400"></a>the other is not yet come, &amp; when he cometh he must continue a <a id="l2401"></a>short  space, &amp; the Beast that was &amp; is not he is the eighth &amp; is <a id="l2402"></a>of the seven, &amp; the ten horns are ten Kings which have received no <a id="l2403"></a>Kingdome as yet, but receive power as Kings the same hour with the Beast, <a id="l2404"></a>&amp; give their Kingdome to him.  The horns therefore reigned not <a id="l2405"></a>till after the sixt head, &amp; then began their reign about the same <a id="l2406"></a>time with the Beast or eight King.  To him they give their King<a id="l2407"></a>dome, &amp; therefore are crowned on his head.  In the raign of the sixt <a id="l2408"></a>head he was not, but rose afterwards out of the  bottomless pit, and <a id="l2409"></a>therefore the first six heads reigned before him &amp; so were the <a id="l2410"></a>Dragon's.  The seventh is also the Dragon's, for the Character of his <a id="l2411"></a>head is, that he should continue but a short space, &amp; this relates to the <a id="l2412"></a>devils or Dragon's coming down amongst the inhabitants of the earth &amp;  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p061r"> &lt;61r&gt; </span> &amp; sea with great wrath knowing that he hath but a short time. Apoc. 12.12.  <a id="l2413"></a>Whence you may understand that the reign of the seventh head lasts untill <a id="l2414"></a>the Dragon be cast into the bottomless pitt &amp; shut up.  The Beast is the <a id="l2415"></a>eighth, not the eighth head but the eighth king.  He is of the seven &amp; con<a id="l2416"></a>sequently a part of the seventh.  Not a successive part, for so there <a id="l2417"></a>would be eight heads.  He is therefore a contemporary part of the <a id="l2418"></a>seventh head, &amp; so the seventh head is a cloven one, the Beast is re<a id="l2419"></a>coning his heads being taken in a large sense for the whole Kingdom <a id="l2420"></a>including the Dragon, but in respect of his rise out of the  bottomless pit <a id="l2421"></a>being taken strictly for but one of the two contemporary parts of <a id="l2422"></a>the last head.</p>
<p id="par101">Now this division of the Kingdome was accompanied with the like <a id="l2423"></a>division of the Church.  For when the woman fled into the wilderness <a id="l2424"></a>she left a remnant of her seed behind her.  She then fled from <a id="l2425"></a>the Dragon, &amp; was nourished a time times &amp; half a time from his <a id="l2426"></a>face, &amp; he mutually, after the exercise of his last anger against <a id="l2427"></a>her, went away from her to make war with that remnant &amp; therefore <a id="l2428"></a>she left that remnant in his Kingdom, the only place where he could <a id="l2429"></a>make war with them, &amp; went away both from the Dragon &amp; from that <a id="l2430"></a>remnant into some other place where she might live free from <a id="l2431"></a>his persecution.  This place was the Beasts Kingdome.  For she fled into <a id="l2432"></a>the wilderness where we find the Beast afterwards; the sea out of which <a id="l2433"></a>he rose, &amp; the waters of the wilderness in which he reigned being one &amp; <a id="l2434"></a>the same people called in different Names in different respects.  For <a id="l2435"></a>as the Church of Israel by division of the Kingdom became two churches, <a id="l2436"></a>&amp; these were signified by two several weomen, Aholah &amp; Aholibah <a id="l2437"></a>E<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>zek.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> 23, so the Christian Church by division of the dragons Kingdome <a id="l2438"></a>becomes two Churches or Weomen; &amp; therefore the woman which at <a id="l2439"></a>first signified the undivided whole, is after the division fitly transferred <a id="l2440"></a>to signify one of the parts.  So then upon the division of the Kingdome <a id="l2441"></a>with it's Church, as the name of the Dragon was transferred from signi<a id="l2442"></a>fying the whole undivided Kingdom to signify that part of it called the <a id="l2443"></a>Earth, &amp; the Name of the Beast is given to the other part represented <a id="l2444"></a>by water, so the name of the woman is at the same time transferred <a id="l2445"></a>from signifying the whole undivided Church to signify that other part <a id="l2446"></a>of it in the waters &amp; the rest of the Church remaining in the Earth is <a id="l2447"></a>called the remnant of her seed.  And by means of this pasting of the <a id="l2448"></a>woman &amp; Dragon from one another she is said upon his persecuting <a id="l2449"></a>her to flee (from him) into the wilderness, &amp; there to be nourished from <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p062r"> &lt;62r&gt; </span>  his face, &amp; he is said to go (from her) to make war with the remnant of <a id="l2450"></a>her seed.  All which will be better understood by considering the prophetical history of the division.</p>
<h2 id="hd23" class="cent">The prophetical history of the division.</h2>
<p id="par102">When the Dragon saw he was cast down, that is presently after the <a id="l2451"></a>opening of the sixt seal, &amp; consequently upon his first coming down a<a id="l2452"></a>mongst the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea, he persecuted the woman and <a id="l2453"></a>to her were given two wings of a great Eagle that she might fly into the <a id="l2454"></a>wilderness.  By the Eagle understand the Kingdom of the Dragon.  For Beasts <a id="l2455"></a>&amp; ravenous Birds signify Kingdoms, &amp; an Eagle, as it was the Ensign of <a id="l2456"></a>the Roman Empire, so in 2 Esdras 12 it is used as a type of that Empire, &amp; <a id="l2457"></a>may have the like signification, the Apocalyps by the consent of <a id="l2458"></a>all Interpreters, respecting that Empire.  Wings, as in Daniels vision <a id="l2459"></a>of the Leopard, signify the contemporary parts of a divided Kingdome, <a id="l2460"></a>such as for instance were the Eastern &amp; western parts of the Roman <a id="l2461"></a>Empire   The two wings in being given <a id="l2467"></a>to the woman signify that she participates the division of the Kingdome, <a id="l2468"></a>&amp; by means thereof at length arrives into the wilderness.  But first <a id="l2469"></a>the Dragon casts out of his mouth waters as a flood after her, that is <a id="l2470"></a>he becomes divided into two Kingdoms, the flood &amp; himself.  For a <a id="l2471"></a>flow or river is the type of a Kingdome &amp; swallowing up &amp; casting or spewing out are types of conquering &amp; setting at liberty again.  So the King of Babylon upon captivating Iudah is said to swallow her up like a Dragon Ier. 51.34. Lam. 2.16, Ezek. 36.3 &amp; upon the return of the captivity God brings forth out of his mouth that which he had swallowed up Isa 51.44.  So also swallowing the nations is put for conquering them. Isa 25.7 &amp; 42.13, 14.   And so: &amp; so the Church of Laodicea <a id="l2472"></a>after she is spewed out of Christs mouth belongs no longer to his <a id="l2473"></a>mystical body, but becomes an erroneous  Schismatical <a id="l2474"></a>Church,  &amp; in like manner the waters when spewed out of the Dragons belly become <a id="l2475"></a>another Kingdom.   These waters being cast <a id="l2477"></a>out towards the wilderness after the woman to cause her to be <a id="l2478"></a>carried away by them, as by a river, seen to have much the same <a id="l2479"></a>relation to the woman here as the many waters in the wilderness have <a id="l2480"></a>to the Babylonian Whore filling upon them, &amp; consequently to signify <a id="l2481"></a>the Beast in his first rise before he was wounded to death by a <a id="l2482"></a>the Beast in his first rise before he was wounded to death by a <a id="l2483"></a>sword.  For the waters on which the whore sitteth signify the Kingdome of <a id="l2484"></a>her beast.  As the Dragon reigning amongst the inhabitants of the <a id="l2485"></a>earth &amp; sea signifies their Kingdoms, the waters in his belly are the <a id="l2486"></a>most proper type of the inhabitants of the watery Elements, &amp; therefore <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p063r"> &lt;63r&gt; </span>  when cast out of his mouth will signify the Kingdome of the waters, and <a id="l2487"></a>the Dragon Emptied of the waters will signify the Kingdome of the earth <a id="l2488"></a>alone.</p>
<p id="par103">The waters being thus cast out of the Dragon's mouth, this earth <a id="l2489"></a>opened her mouth &amp; by conquest swallowed up the floor, &amp; so the Kingdom &amp; Church <a id="l2490"></a>became one again.  Then was the Dragon wrath with the woman, that is <a id="l2491"></a>the whole undivided Kingdome persecuted among the whole undivided Church.  <a id="l2492"></a>For all prophesy is of eternal visible actions, &amp; therefore this <a id="l2493"></a>anger denotes not a bare internal act of the mind but an external <a id="l2494"></a>visible persecution, so that the woman was not yet fully escaped from <a id="l2495"></a>him into the wilderness.  But now upon a new division of the Kingdom <a id="l2496"></a>&amp; Church she escaping thither &amp; leaving behind her a remnant of <a id="l2497"></a>her seed, he mutually went from her to persecute that remnant, <a id="l2498"></a>&amp; left this region of the sea to the Beast rising out of it.</p>
<p id="par104">And hence we may understand how the Beast was wounded <a id="l2499"></a>to death with a sword &amp; revived.  When he rose out of the sea then <a id="l2500"></a>he lived again, &amp; therefore the time of his death was in the sixt <a id="l2501"></a>head.  Whence it is said in the time of that head that he was &amp; is not <a id="l2502"></a>&amp; shall ascend out of the Angels.  He was before the earth, swallowed <a id="l2503"></a>up the flood, &amp; then he ceased to be till his rise out of the sea, <a id="l2504"></a>&amp; so the wound was made in the middle of the sixt head by the victor<a id="l2505"></a>ious Earth, she wounding &amp; conquering him with a sword, and <a id="l2506"></a>thereby subjecting his Kingdom &amp; uniting it to hers which is called <a id="l2507"></a>her swallowing up the waters.  For the wound is not said to be <a id="l2508"></a>made by chopping off either side of the head but to be made in it, <a id="l2509"></a>that is not in the beginning or end of the raign of any head but <a id="l2510"></a>in the middle time of the raign.  We shewed above how the earth's opening the abyss of her mouth &amp; swallowing up the flood alluded to the opened pit or alveus of the  frozen red Sea into which the Egyptians were swallowed up: whence it is to be conceived that the sea or Abyss out of which the Beast arose was that same mouth or abyss of the earth  <a id="l2511"></a><br><span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> into which he sank before in the form of a flood; the descent <a id="l2521"></a>expressing his descending into Hades at his death &amp; the ascent <a id="l2522"></a>his resurrection from the dead.  This Abyss out of which he arose could not be that  well <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p064r"> &lt;64r&gt; </span>  out of which the Locusts arose, for that was locked up when the Beast <a id="l2523"></a>ascended, &amp; there is no other pitt or Abyss in all the Apocalyps  out of which the  should arise, except that mouth which the earth opened.</p>
<p id="par105">From the division of the Kingdome &amp; Church we may learn <a id="l2525"></a>also why the prophesy of the seventh seal or head is so often re<a id="l2526"></a>peated.  The prophesy of the seals &amp; Trumpets descends by one <a id="l2527"></a>single continual series of things to the end of that sixt seale, <a id="l2528"></a>&amp; then that of the seventh is split into collateral narratives, the <a id="l2529"></a>affairs of the Church being described first in the sealed Israelites <a id="l2530"></a>&amp; palm bearing multitude, &amp; then again in the measured Temple <a id="l2531"></a>&amp; two witnesses, &amp; the affairs of the Kingdome in the seven <a id="l2532"></a>Trumpets &amp; those repeated in the seven Thunders.  The description <a id="l2533"></a>of both Church &amp; State is doubled to shew that the Kingdom &amp; the <a id="l2534"></a>Church are both divided during all the times of this head or <a id="l2535"></a>seal &amp; division began together.  And so in the Repetition the Pro<a id="l2536"></a>phesy of the woman &amp; Beasts is split into two by the interposition <a id="l2537"></a>of the seven Vials, they being described both before in the 13<sup>th</sup> &amp; <a id="l2538"></a>14<sup>th</sup> Chapters &amp; after in the 17<sup>th</sup> 18<sup>th</sup> &amp; 19<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<h2 id="hd24" class="cent">Of the two fals churches signified by the two-horned Beast &amp; Woman which fled into the Wilderness &amp; that this Woman became the Whore of Babylon</h2>
<p id="par106">So then at the opening of the seventh seal the Beast rose out <a id="l2539"></a>of the sea, &amp; the Kingdom became divided between him &amp; the <a id="l2540"></a>Dragon, &amp; the woman fled into the wilderness from the face of the <a id="l2541"></a>Dragon, &amp; left in his Kingdom a remnant of her seed.  This rem<a id="l2542"></a>nant keep the commandments of God, &amp; therefore are the true <a id="l2543"></a>Church of his Kingdom.  At the same time or soon after, the two <a id="l2544"></a>horned Beast rose out of the earth, that is out of the inhabitants of <a id="l2545"></a>the earth or people of the Dragons kingdom, &amp; therefore this <a id="l2546"></a>Beast is the fals  Church of that Kingdome.  For in having <a id="l2547"></a>two horns like the Lamb (that is like the seven Churches of Asia <a id="l2548"></a>which are the horns &amp; mystical body of the Lamb) &amp; in being called <a id="l2549"></a>a fals Prophet, &amp; thereby opposed to one or both the two witnesses, <a id="l2550"></a>which are true Prophets &amp; signify Churches, he must be of an <a id="l2551"></a>Ecclesiastical kind.  Whence some understand his imitating Elias <a id="l2552"></a>in bringing down fire from heaven to be meant of excommu<a id="l2553"></a>nication &amp; that partly because in the pronouncing thereof the <a id="l2554"></a>Bishop swings a lighted torch from above his head downwards, <a id="l2555"></a>&amp; partly because fire signifies war, &amp; for one Church to ex<a id="l2556"></a>communicate another is to proclaim an Ecclesiastical war be<a id="l2557"></a>tween them.  Now the whore, seeing she rides upon the Beast, is plainly  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p065r"> &lt;65r&gt; </span>  his fals Church reigning over him, &amp; therefore the fals Prophet must <a id="l2558"></a>be the Church of the Dragon.  For this Prophet survives the whore <a id="l2559"></a>Apoc. 19.2, 20, &amp; is therefore different from her.  He acts before <a id="l2560"></a>the face of the first Beast, Apoc 13, 12, that is in a neighbouring King<a id="l2561"></a>dom, &amp; there is no other Kingdom described in the Apocalyps besides <a id="l2562"></a>the Dragon's.  There is a Synagogue of Satan Apoc. 2.9 &amp; 3.9, <a id="l2563"></a>that is an idolatrous Church of the Dragon, &amp; there is no other ido<a id="l2564"></a>latrous Church described among the Apocalyptic persons which can be <a id="l2565"></a>his besides the fals Prophet.  These two therefore are belated to <a id="l2566"></a>one another as a Kingdome &amp; it's Church.  And this is further <a id="l2567"></a>intimated by saying that the two horned Beast spake as the Dragon.  <a id="l2568"></a>The ten horned Beast rose out of the sea, the two-horned  <a id="l2569"></a>out of the earth, &amp; therefore they belong to the different regions <a id="l2570"></a>of the earth and sea, &amp; the earth is the Dragon's territory as the <a id="l2571"></a>sea is the Beasts.  So then there are two Churches of the Dragons <a id="l2572"></a>kingdom, a true one called the remnant of the woman's seed, &amp; <a id="l2573"></a>a fals one called the two horned Beasts or fals Prophet, &amp; in <a id="l2574"></a>like manner there are two Churches of the Beasts Kingdome, <a id="l2575"></a>a true one called the saints, whom the Beast makes war upon &amp; <a id="l2576"></a>overcomes Apoc. 13.7, &amp; a fals one called the whore of Babylon.  <a id="l2577"></a>These are the six persons I told you of.  For the better understand<a id="l2578"></a>ing of which it remains now that I shew that the whore is that same woman <a id="l2579"></a>who before appeared in heaven &amp; fled into the wilderness.</p>
<p id="par107">The flying of the woman into the wilderness from the face of the <a id="l2580"></a>serpent must consist in one or more of these four things, either that the people of <a id="l2581"></a>the woman became few in number so as to escape the Dragons per<a id="l2582"></a>secution by flying hid among his people as among trees in a wilder<a id="l2583"></a>ness, or that she fled by local motion out of the Dragons Kingdome <a id="l2584"></a>into some foreign place called the wildernes, or that her name <a id="l2585"></a>without local motion of the people was translated from signifying <a id="l2586"></a>the whole Church in the whole kingdom before division to signifie <a id="l2587"></a>afterwards that part only which was in the Beasts kingdom, or that she <a id="l2588"></a>escaped the persecution by changing her religion &amp; fled into a <a id="l2589"></a>state of spirituall barrenness.</p>
<p id="par108">The first of these four ways it cannot be.  For whilst the <a id="l2590"></a>woman in flying left a remnant of her seed, it is to be con<a id="l2591"></a>ceived that the name of the woman or Church went along with the <a id="l2592"></a>greater part, or at the least that the woman was not less then the rem<a id="l2593"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>nant<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> that the remnant were not so few but that the Dragon after <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p066r"> &lt;66r&gt; </span>  the woman was fled from his into the wilderness could see them, &amp; so to <a id="l2594"></a>make war upon them, Apoc. 12.17.  Nor does the Dragon only make <a id="l2595"></a>war upon this remnant, but the Beast also makes war upon the <a id="l2596"></a>saints in his kingdom, whilst the woman rests in her place in the <a id="l2597"></a>wilderness &amp; is fed &amp; nourished there, that is grows rich &amp; wealthy.  <a id="l2598"></a>Also the people of the two witnesses prophesy to the Nations during the <a id="l2599"></a>1260 days of the womans staying in the wilderness, &amp; by their pro<a id="l2600"></a>phesying torment them, that dwell upon the earth, &amp; are so visible <a id="l2601"></a>that the Beast makes war upon them, &amp; they of the peoples &amp; kindreds <a id="l2602"></a>&amp; tongues &amp; Nations see their dead bodies &amp; rejoyce at their <a id="l2603"></a>death.</p>
<p id="par109">The second of  four ways it cannot be.  For the wilderness is <a id="l2604"></a>the region of the Beast Apoc. 17, &amp; consequently was the Dragons <a id="l2605"></a>territory before Apoc. 13.2.  For the people of the wildernesses <a id="l2606"></a>they are divided into many kingdoms, are signifyed by the many <a id="l2607"></a>waters or streams of Euphrates upon which Babylon the great whore <a id="l2608"></a><span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>sitteth<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Apoc. 1.15 &amp; as they are collected into one body of many <a id="l2609"></a>kingdoms subjecting themselves to the whores dominion are repre<a id="l2610"></a>sented by the Beast with ten horns upon which the Whore sitteth.  The <a id="l2611"></a>whore sitting on the waters &amp; on the Beast signifies her reigning <a id="l2612"></a>over the people signified by the waters &amp; by the Beast.  The waters <a id="l2613"></a>signify in general the peoples or kingdoms of the wilderness subject <a id="l2614"></a>to the whore, &amp; the Beast with his ten horns signifies that there are <a id="l2615"></a>ten kingdoms in the wilderness subject to the whore &amp; no more.  <a id="l2616"></a>Seing then  the territory of the Beast is the wilderness, &amp; the <a id="l2617"></a>dragon gave the Beast his power &amp; seat Apoc 13.2, its plain that <a id="l2618"></a>the wilderness is that territory which the Dragon gave the Beast, &amp; by <a id="l2619"></a>consequence possest himself before when he began first to per<a id="l2620"></a>secute the woman.  Nor can it be said that the woman fled from the <a id="l2621"></a>Dragon into the territory of the Beast to escape persecution seing <a id="l2622"></a>the Beast was as great an enemy to the saints as the Dragon, <a id="l2623"></a>making war with them &amp; overcoming them during the 42 months <a id="l2624"></a>or 1260 days that the woman rested in her place in the wilderness <a id="l2625"></a>free from persecution.</p>
<p id="par110">There remain therefore only the third &amp; fourth ways of <a id="l2626"></a>flying.  And the third way I have explained &amp; admitted above, <a id="l2627"></a>but the fourth way is that which I here contend for.  It may seem <a id="l2628"></a>indeed a blessing that God prepared the woman a place in the <a id="l2629"></a>wilderness, &amp; that she should be fed there 1260 days &amp; that two <a id="l2630"></a>things were given her to fly thither from the persecution <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p067r"> &lt;67r&gt; </span> &amp; so it might be a temporal blessing ordained of God, &amp; yet her flight <a id="l2631"></a>thither might be an evil action.  For God hardened Pharaoh's heart <a id="l2632"></a>&amp; put into the heart of the ten Kings to agree &amp; give their kingdom <a id="l2633"></a>to the Beast, &amp; yet that agreement was a bad action.  Also God <a id="l2634"></a>raised up <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n57-ref">[57]</sup> Baasha &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n58-ref">[58]</sup> Zimri, &amp; by a Prophet annointed <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n59-ref">[59]</sup> Iehu <a id="l2635"></a>to slay &amp; succeed their Kings, &amp; yet David thô annointed as much <a id="l2636"></a>as Iehu, thought it unlawfull to slay the Lords annointed what <a id="l2637"></a>ever is done be it good or evil is done by the counsel of God, for <a id="l2638"></a>which reason we pray dayly that God would not lead us into temptation <a id="l2639"></a>&amp; therefore whether it be good or evil is not determined by <a id="l2640"></a>God's determining it, but must be learned from the circumstances <a id="l2641"></a>of the thing.  Now that the woman by flying into the wilderness did evil <a id="l2642"></a>so as to change her religion, &amp; degenerate into the whore of <a id="l2643"></a>Babylon, I gather from the following arguments.</p>
<p id="par111">First because the woman fled from heaven where she appeared <a id="l2644"></a>in the beginning.  For heaven, when it respects the Church, is the <a id="l2645"></a>symbol of holiness &amp; truth.  And secondly because the place into <a id="l2646"></a>which she fled is spiritually called a wilderness.  For this is as much as <a id="l2647"></a>to say a region spiritually barren or which brings forth no fruits of <a id="l2648"></a>the spirit.   Translation from place to place in the world natural signifies translation from state to state in the world politique as we explained above &amp; therefore the flight <a id="l2649"></a>of the woman from heaven into the wilderness denotes her  passing from a  state of holiness &amp; truth into a state of spiritual barrenness. , </p>
<p id="par112">A third reason is because the persecution of the woman by the <a id="l2659"></a>Dragon is represented to be the cause of her flight from him <a id="l2660"></a>into the wilderness.  For a persecution can make her fly but in <a id="l2661"></a>these three respects, either in becoming thin &amp; few in number, <a id="l2662"></a>or in shifting her country, or els in changing her religion to <a id="l2663"></a>escape him, &amp; thereby becoming spiritually barren.  The two first <a id="l2664"></a>ways we have already confuted, &amp; therefore it might be the third.</p>
<p id="par113">Another reason is because the woman began to fly into the wil<a id="l2665"></a>derness upon the Devils coming down amongst the inhabitants of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p068r"> &lt;68r&gt; </span> earth &amp; sea.  These inhabitants could not be heathens, because the <a id="l2666"></a>Devil was among them before.  they must be such as he was not amongst before <a id="l2667"></a>that is Christians: &amp; consequently the people of the woman.  Upon the Devils <a id="l2668"></a>coming down he persecutes the woman, &amp; to usher in this persecution a <a id="l2669"></a>wo is at the same time denounced to those inhabitants.  <em class="underline">Wo to the <a id="l2670"></a>inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea, for the Devil is come down amongst <a id="l2671"></a>you, having great wrath, because he knoweth he hath but a short <a id="l2672"></a>time</em>.  And therefore these inhabitants are most certainly the <a id="l2673"></a>people of the woman whom he persecutes upon his coming down, &amp; <a id="l2674"></a>yet are they not all the people of the woman.  For at the same time <a id="l2675"></a>that the wo is denounced to these inhabitants the heavens &amp; they <a id="l2676"></a>that dwell therein are bid to rejoyce, &amp; that because they had overcome <a id="l2677"></a>the Dragon by the blood of the Lamb, &amp; by the word of their testimony, <a id="l2678"></a>&amp; saved not their lives unto death.  The inhabitants of the heavens <a id="l2679"></a>were therefore Christians as well as the inhabitants of the earth <a id="l2680"></a>&amp; sea: &amp; therefore the woman was composed of them all; they <a id="l2681"></a>being one Church outwardly &amp; visibly, but inwardly distinguished <a id="l2682"></a>into the inhabitants of the heavens, &amp; the inhabitants of the earth &amp; <a id="l2683"></a>sea, that is into true saints &amp; mere external professors of Chris<a id="l2684"></a>tianity.  Whence a wo is denounced only to the last.  For in persecu<a id="l2685"></a>tion the wo is not to the faithfull who endure it, but to outward <a id="l2686"></a>professors who fall away from the faith to avoid it.  'Tis not a<a id="l2687"></a>greeable to the honour of the scriptures to denounce a wo to martyrs <a id="l2688"></a>&amp; those who persevere in suffering for the truth.  We are exhorted <a id="l2689"></a>again &amp; again to rejoyce at such sufferings for the truth.  We are exhorted <a id="l2690"></a>again &amp; again to rejoyce at such sufferings as in the greatest <a id="l2691"></a>happiness Matt. 5.10, 11, 12.  Iames 1.3. 1 Pet. 4.12, 13.  The wo <a id="l2692"></a>is to hypocrites who in time of tryal fall away, &amp; therefore <a id="l2693"></a>implys the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea to be such.  So then <a id="l2694"></a>the woman in respect of the saints is here represented in heaven, <a id="l2695"></a>in respect of the hypocrites or her communion is below on <a id="l2696"></a>Earth where the Dragon persecutes her &amp; consists of the inha<a id="l2697"></a>bitants of the earth &amp; sea, &amp; upon persecution flees into the <a id="l2698"></a>wilderness.  And therefore her translation from heaven to the <a id="l2699"></a>wilderness on Earth denotes her becoming hypocritical and <a id="l2700"></a>apostate.  Now the devils coming down amongst the inhabitants <a id="l2701"></a>below with great wrath denotes the coming in of Idolatry and <a id="l2702"></a>then after when the Dragon is called the Devil 'tis to express the <a id="l2703"></a><span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>difference<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> he is cast out of heaven by his feet <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible because the manuscript is foxed">{illeg}</span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p069r"> &lt;69r&gt; </span>  down amongst the inhabitants below &amp; <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>put upon respect<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of Idolatry, <a id="l2704"></a>as appears by the description of his coming out: <em class="underline">The great Dragon <a id="l2705"></a>was cast out that old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan which deceiveth <a id="l2706"></a>the whole world</em>.  A wo therefore is denounced to the inhabitants <a id="l2707"></a>of the earth &amp; sea, because the Devil or Idolatry is by persecuting <a id="l2708"></a>the woman from the in amongst them.  And seing those inhabitants <a id="l2709"></a>are the hypocritical part of the Church &amp; the wo belongs to them all, <a id="l2710"></a>they all become idolatrous, that is the woman so far as she is below <a id="l2711"></a>on earth &amp; flees into the wilderness, becomes a Whore such as is <a id="l2712"></a>the Whore of Babylon.</p>
<p id="par114">Another reason is because there is this distinction put between the <a id="l2713"></a>woman &amp; her seed that they keep the Commandments of God, &amp; have <a id="l2714"></a>the testimony of Iesus: which is as much as to say that she in her flight <a id="l2715"></a>forsakes those commandments &amp; has not that testimony.  Understand <a id="l2716"></a>this of the outward profession &amp; form of religion, the people of the <a id="l2717"></a>Sea or Beasts Kingdom being most propense to the Apostacy, &amp; upon <a id="l2718"></a>division of the Kingdom falling <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>over them<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> in outward profession, &amp; those <a id="l2719"></a>of the Earth which helped the woman justly persevering in the true outward <a id="l2720"></a>profession untill the Dragon make <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>war upon<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> them, &amp; partly falling <a id="l2721"></a>away with the whore &amp; by <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Dragon coming the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> wo <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>arises<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible because the manuscript is faint">{illeg}</span> who rises out of the earth at <a id="l2722"></a>or soon after the division of the Kingdom. </p>
<p id="par115">A sixt reason is that the Woman was fed &amp; nourished in the <a id="l2723"></a>wilderness all the 1260 days from the face of the serpent.  <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> and <a id="l2724"></a>food signify riches, &amp; therefore <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>to<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> be fed is to be <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>supplied<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> with <a id="l2725"></a>riches &amp; wealth.  It alludes (as I told you) to Israel's being fed <a id="l2726"></a>in the wilderness with Manna &amp; Quailes, &amp; their falling away through <a id="l2727"></a>fullness of bread.  <em class="underline">The Lord's portion</em>, saith Moses <em class="underline">is his people.  <a id="l2728"></a>He found him in a desert land &amp; in the wast howling wilderness.  He <a id="l2729"></a>made him to ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the <a id="l2730"></a>encrease of the fields, &amp; he made him to suck honey out of the rock &amp; <a id="l2731"></a>oyle out of the flinty rock.  Butter of kine &amp; milk of sheep with  <a id="l2732"></a>fat of Lambs &amp; Lambs of the breed of Bashan &amp; Goats with the <a id="l2733"></a>fat of kidnies of wheat &amp; thou didst drink the pure blood of the <a id="l2734"></a>grape.  But Iesurun waxed fat &amp; kicked, thou art waxen fat, thou <a id="l2735"></a>art grown thick with fatness: then he forsook God which made him <a id="l2736"></a>&amp; lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation. They provoked him <a id="l2737"></a>to jealousy with strange Gods, with abominations provoked they <a id="l2738"></a>him to anger.  They sacrificed to Devils not to God, to Gods whom <a id="l2739"></a>they knew not, to new Gods that came newly up whom your fathers</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p070r"> &lt;70r&gt; </span>   <em class="underline">feared not.</em> Deut 32.  Now to this feeding of the wilder<a id="l2740"></a>ness &amp; her concomitant Apostacy to the worship of Baal Peor does <a id="l2741"></a>the Apocalyps (as I told you) allude.  For as in the 12<sup>th</sup> Chapter the <a id="l2742"></a>Prophet tells you how the woman fled into the wilderness the they <a id="l2743"></a>should feed her there; so in the 17<sup>th</sup> &amp; 18<sup>th</sup> Chapters he goes after her <a id="l2744"></a>into the wilderness to shew you how the Merchants the earth feed <a id="l2745"></a>her there of with all kinds of fruits the her soul lusted after, &amp; with all <a id="l2746"></a>things the were dainty &amp; goodly Apoc. 18.14, &amp; enrich her with all <a id="l2747"></a>things the were precious vers 12, 13, &amp; how she lives deliciously <a id="l2748"></a>with the Kings of the Earth, &amp; through luxury commits fornication <a id="l2749"></a>vers 7, 9.  The description of the affluence &amp; feeding of the great <a id="l2750"></a>whore in the wilderness is nothing else then a commentary on the <a id="l2751"></a>feeding of the Woman which in the 12<sup>th</sup> chapter fled thither.  This Woman, seing she <a id="l2752"></a>fled from the face of the serpent into the wilderness where the <a id="l2753"></a>whore is, &amp; the Kingdom <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible because the manuscript is faint">{illeg}</span> fals <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>one<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>.  But the true <a id="l2754"></a>Church are of the Saints whom the <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Beast<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>  makes <a id="l2755"></a>war upon &amp; overcomes <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>Apoc.<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> 13.5, 7. &amp; by the power given him over all nations oppresses all the time of his reign  Whilst these are afflicted <a id="l2756"></a>&amp; opprest she is fed from the face of the persecuting serpent, the <a id="l2757"></a>is grows rich &amp; continues free from persecution &amp; therefore <a id="l2758"></a>is a fals Church, a corrupt Woman or Whore in the wilderness.</p>
<p id="par116">Another reason is the the Whore in the wilderness denotes <a id="l2759"></a> the Church in a state of Idolatry, &amp; this Church before it grew <a id="l2760"></a>idolatrous must have been the pure &amp; true Church of God, &amp; con<a id="l2761"></a>sequently the same woman with the in the 12<sup>th</sup> chapter.  For the Church <a id="l2762"></a>under the Law did not use to be signifyed by one woman when pure, <a id="l2763"></a>&amp; by another when corrupt, but by one &amp; the same Woman from first <a id="l2764"></a>to last, the wife of God sometimes chast, but very frequently playing <a id="l2765"></a>the Whore, as you may see in Ier. 3. Ezek. 23. Hosea 2 &amp; 3.  And so <a id="l2766"></a>under the Gospel the Church from the beginning to the end is one &amp; <a id="l2767"></a>the same woman first chast, &amp; afterwards forsaking her husband, <a id="l2768"></a>&amp; playing the Whore with other lovers the Kings of the earth.  In the <a id="l2769"></a>Church under the Law a woman is made the type of the multitude <a id="l2770"></a>thereof.  Whither pure or impure, &amp; when the multitude degene<a id="l2771"></a>rates the rest cease to be signifyed by the woman, &amp; are called <a id="l2772"></a>either Prophets or servants of God, or by some such other <a id="l2773"></a>Name, &amp; so in the Church under the Gospel, the type of the Woman <a id="l2774"></a>goes along with the multitude, &amp; when the multitude fall away the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p071r"> &lt;71r&gt; </span>   rest are signified by the Names of <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Provosts, <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible because the manuscript is faint">{illeg}</span> servants<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of God, <a id="l2775"></a>Witnesses, Martyrs &amp; the like.  <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Since<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> therefore the Inhabitants of <a id="l2776"></a>Earth &amp; Sea to whom the Devil came down were Christians, &amp; by <a id="l2777"></a>the coming down of the Devil degenerated into Idolatry as has been <a id="l2778"></a>explained, &amp; the woe is denounced not to some few, but to the <a id="l2779"></a>inhabitants in general, &amp; consequently the generality of Christians <a id="l2780"></a>signifyed by the first Woman did at her flight into the wilderness <a id="l2781"></a>fall into Idolatry, &amp; therefore was a Whore in the wilderness, <a id="l2782"></a>&amp; seing also the Whore is such a Whore, &amp; before she became a <a id="l2783"></a>Whore was a true Church, &amp; consequently such a woman as the in <a id="l2784"></a>heaven, &amp; seing there are not two  true Weomen  nor two Whores <a id="l2785"></a>described in the Apocalyps, it remains the they be the same.  The woman <a id="l2786"></a> was fed in the wilderness  1260 days Apoc. 12.6, &amp; all this <a id="l2787"></a>while the Whores Beast reigned  Ch. 13.5, &amp; there<a id="l2788"></a>fore if the Whore was different from the Woman, they would have <a id="l2789"></a>been both together all the time in the wilderness, whereas the Prophet <a id="l2790"></a>saw but one woman there &amp; describes her to the universal Church <a id="l2791"></a>of the wilderness <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>sitting<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> upon the Beast &amp; when the when the many waters <a id="l2792"></a>there &amp; reining over <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>the King of the Earth <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible because the manuscript is faint">{illeg}</span> &amp; signify<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the <a id="l2793"></a>faithfull from her by no other <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible because the manuscript is faint">{illeg}</span> then the of Saints <a id="l2794"></a>&amp; martyrs or Witnesses of Iesus.</p>
<p id="par117">An eighth reason is because this prophesy of the Woman &amp; Dragon <a id="l2795"></a>being a commentary upon the prophesy of the Seales, the woman signifies <a id="l2796"></a>the Church Catholick in the prophesy, &amp; consequently is the same Church <a id="l2797"></a>with the twelve tribes out of which a few are numbred &amp; sealed.  Now the <a id="l2798"></a>Church by the sealing is divided into two sorts of people, the few <a id="l2799"></a>sealed out of all the tribes, &amp; the tribes themselves out of which <a id="l2800"></a>those few are selected &amp; sealed.  Those tribes are the Church signi<a id="l2801"></a>fied by the Woman as wel after the selecting &amp; sealing a few out of <a id="l2802"></a>them as before: the case being exactly the same as in the Church <a id="l2803"></a>of Israel divided into the servants of God which were but <a id="l2804"></a>few in number &amp; into the erring multitude represented <a id="l2805"></a> in the old Prophets by a Woman going a whoring.  <a id="l2806"></a>I told you the this sealing answers to the loss of the two Goats in the Fast.  <a id="l2807"></a>These sealed are the Lords lot to be sacrificed, &amp; the unsealed are the scape Goat which bears away the sins of the people into the wilderness; &amp; <a id="l2808"></a>to these two answer the Woman flying into the wilderness, &amp; the remnant <a id="l2809"></a>of her seed left behind her to be sacrificed in the war which the Dragon  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p072r"> &lt;72r&gt; </span>  at her flight goes to make war upon.</p>
<p id="par118">And lastly as the Beast on which the whore sitteth is no new Beast, but <a id="l2810"></a>was described before in the 13<sup>th</sup> Chapter, so by analogy the Whore is no <a id="l2811"></a>new Woman out the same with her described before in the 12<sup>th</sup> &amp; 13<sup>th</sup> Chapters, <a id="l2812"></a>&amp; finisheth it in the 17<sup>th</sup> &amp; 18<sup>th</sup>.  There he tells the beginning of both <a id="l2813"></a>&amp; the end of neither: here he begins with the beginning of neither but <a id="l2814"></a>goes on to tell the end of both.  There he carries on the Womans his<a id="l2815"></a>tory unto her flight into the wilderness &amp; so leaves it: here he goes <a id="l2816"></a>after her into the wilderness to see her there, &amp; tells us her behaviour <a id="l2817"></a>in the place &amp; how she should at length be destroyed by the ten Kings.  <a id="l2818"></a>There he tells us how the Beast rose out of the sea, &amp; began to act, <a id="l2819"></a>here he goes on to tell us how after the ruin of the Whore, the Beast <a id="l2820"></a>perished in the war with the Lamb.  And so in both places together we <a id="l2821"></a>have a compleate description of both.</p>
<p id="par119">It may indeed seem strange the so glorious a Woman should <a id="l2822"></a>degenerate into so vile a Whore, but this strangness is no argument <a id="l2823"></a>against the truth.  For the Prophet himself wondred at it with <a id="l2824"></a>great admiration.  He wondred not at her rich apparell.  Such <a id="l2825"></a>sights are common enough in the world.  The monstrous shape of <a id="l2826"></a>the seven headed &amp; ten horned Beast was a much stranger sight, <a id="l2827"></a>&amp; yet he expressed no wonder at that.  'Twas at the Woman's drun<a id="l2828"></a>kenness with the blood of the Saints that he wondred.  <em class="underline">I saw</em>, saith he, <a id="l2829"></a><em class="underline">the Woman drunken with the blood of the <a id="l2830"></a>Martyrs of Iesus, &amp; when I saw I wondred with great admiration.</em>  That the Church should be persecuted was no wonder, but that this <a id="l2831"></a>woman should do it; that this Woman, whom he had seen before glori<a id="l2832"></a>ously in heaven suffering persecution under others, should herself <a id="l2833"></a>turn such a bloody persecutrix of the Saints, this was sufficient <a id="l2834"></a>to make him wonder (as he expresses) with great admiration.  And <a id="l2835"></a>if it seemed so wonderful to him, there is  more reason we should <a id="l2836"></a>think it true because wonderfull, then too wonderful to be true.</p>
<p id="par120">So then the Whore of Babylon being that woman which fled into the <a id="l2837"></a>wilderness, there are but four wicked persons in the Apocalyps, the Dragon <a id="l2838"></a>&amp; ten horned Beast &amp; their erring Churches the two horned Beast or <a id="l2839"></a>fals Prophet &amp; the Whore.  For the fals Prophet is plainly the two horned <a id="l2840"></a>Beast.  For this Beast spake as the Dragon &amp; a speaking Ecclesiastical <a id="l2841"></a>body is a Prophet.  By speaking he caused the Earth to worship the first  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p073r"> &lt;73r&gt; </span>   Beast, &amp; therefore was a fals Prophet.  <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>After<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> we did miracles in the sight of <a id="l2842"></a>the first Beast, &amp; by those miracles deceived them  that dwell on the <a id="l2843"></a>Earth &amp; caused them to make an Image to that Beast &amp; worship it &amp; to <a id="l2844"></a>receive his mark, &amp; therefore he is that same fals Prophet with that spoken <a id="l2845"></a>of afterward who together with the Dragon &amp; ten horned Beast sent out <a id="l2846"></a>froggs out of their mouths to gather men to the battel of the great day <a id="l2847"></a>&amp; in that battel was taken &amp; together with the ten horned Beast cast into the <a id="l2848"></a>the lake of fire.  For this fals Prophet is not only conjoyned with the ten <a id="l2849"></a>horned Beast as the two horned beast was before but is also expressly <a id="l2850"></a>called the fals Prophet who wrought miracles before this beast with <a id="l2851"></a>which he deceived them that had the mark of the Beast &amp; then that worshipped <a id="l2852"></a>his Image, which is all one as to call him the two horned Beast.  In the <a id="l2853"></a>13<sup>th</sup> Chapter is described the rise of the ten horned Beast &amp; two horned <a id="l2854"></a>Beast or fals Prophet but not their ruin, &amp; here in the 19 Chapter is <a id="l2855"></a>described their ruin but not their rise.

<h2 id="hd25" class="cent">Of the two true Churches signified by the two Witnesses</h2>
<p id="par121">Now besides these four persons there are the remnant of the woman's seed <a id="l2870"></a>whom the Dragon makes war upon in his kingdom, &amp; the saints whom the <a id="l2871"></a>Beast (taken in a strict sense). makes war upon in his kingdom &amp; overcomes, &amp; these as I said are <a id="l2872"></a>the two true Churches of those Kingdoms.  These  two are in all things <a id="l2873"></a>opposed to the two fals Churches, &amp; therefore the fals Churches being called <a id="l2874"></a>the fals Prophet &amp; the Prophetess Iezebel, in opposition to them the true ones <a id="l2875"></a>are called the two Prophets that is the true ones.  And as the old Prophets in <a id="l2876"></a> teaching are said to signify or witness against Iudah &amp; Israel (2 King. 17.<a id="l2877"></a>13, 15. 2 Chron. 24.19. Nehem. 9.26, 30 Isa 43.10, 12) So these two Prophets are also <a id="l2878"></a>called witnesses.  The remnant of the woman's seed in being said to <a id="l2879"></a>have the <em class="underline">Testimony of Iesus</em> have the Character of one witnesses &amp; the <a id="l2880"></a>saints whom the Beast makes war upon &amp; overcomes in being called the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p074r"> &lt;74r&gt; </span>  martyrs of Iesus with whose blood the whore is drunken have the Character <a id="l2881"></a>of another witness.  For the whore  shew those martyrs by the tem<a id="l2882"></a>poral sword of the Beast she rides upon.    These are therefore the two witnesses with prophesy in sackcloth.  For those two Witnesses are syn<a id="l2883"></a>chronal to the two fals Churches &amp; are placed the one in the Earth &amp; the <a id="l2884"></a>other in the sea as the fals Churches are.  For they prophesy all the 1260 days that is all the time that the woman is <a id="l2885"></a>fed in the wilderness, &amp; that the Beast  reigns; &amp; they answer to the <a id="l2886"></a>two Eagle's wings of the woman  spread into the earth &amp; sea, as was explained, <a id="l2887"></a>&amp; are the mystical body of the Angel who sets his right food upon the sea, <a id="l2888"></a>&amp; his left foot upon the earth, &amp; lye dead in the streets of the great <a id="l2889"></a>City which is spiritually called Sodom &amp; Egypt that is the Whore &amp; the Dragon <a id="l2890"></a>or the sea &amp; the earth.  These two witnesses therefore are the Saints <a id="l2891"></a>whom the Dragon &amp; Beast make war upon.  For true Churches coin<a id="l2892"></a>cident in time &amp; place are necessarily the prophesy of the <a id="l2893"></a>book sweet in the Prophets mouth  the state of the true Church <a id="l2894"></a> is more fully &amp; distinctly described then that of the fals ones.  In that <a id="l2895"></a>of the <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>same<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> book bitter in his belly the fals Churches &amp; erring kingdoms <a id="l2896"></a> <a id="l2897"></a>are described at large, &amp; the state of the true Church only glanced <a id="l2898"></a>at; but both being prophesies of the same book, &amp; the first an in<a id="l2899"></a>troduction to the last, the Churches of the same times regions and <a id="l2900"></a>kingdoms are prophesied of in them both.</p>
<p id="par122">  Some interpret the words ὅταν τελεσωσι not <em class="underline">when they <a id="l2901"></a>shall finish</em> their prophesy, but <em class="underline">when they shall perform it</em>, &amp; so <a id="l2902"></a>make them ly dead all the time of their prophesying in sackcloth.  <a id="l2903"></a>The interpretation is hard &amp; yet may deserve some consideration.  For The persons spoken of in the Apocalyps being not single persons<a id="l2904"></a>but bodies of men, killing every where in this prophesy taken not in <a id="l2905"></a>a litteral sense for killing of single persons, but in a mystical one for dis<a id="l2906"></a>solving those bodies: &amp; so killing these two Churches is dissolving their <a id="l2907"></a>Ecclesiastical government, &amp; dispersing their people.  When they were thus <a id="l2908"></a> mystically dead they were in the same state with <a id="l2909"></a>the old Prophets in Israel in the worship of the  two calves, and <a id="l2910"></a>therefore in allusion to the Prophets &amp; holy men of those times they are <a id="l2911"></a>here fitly represented by men prophesying.  And to express this the better, <a id="l2912"></a>they are said to be in the funeral habit of sackcloth (black as hair Apoc. <a id="l2913"></a>6.12) all the time they prophesy, &amp; to be not put in graves, but seen <a id="l2914"></a>of them that dwell on the earth all the time they are dead.  During the <a id="l2915"></a>42 months that the nations trod under foot the holy city, they worshipped in <a id="l2916"></a>the outward Court, that is, had the outward face &amp; form of a Church, <a id="l2917"></a>&amp; the saints who were expelled the outward Court &amp;  all that <a id="l2918"></a>time worshipped only in the outward Temple were in a state of dissolution <a id="l2919"></a>&amp; death as to Ecclesiastical government &amp; polity.  And after they were <a id="l2920"></a>once thus killed they were not so capable of being mystically killed again  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p075r"> &lt;75r&gt; </span> while their prophesy in sackcloth casted.  The witnesses  might be better able <a id="l2921"></a>to torment the nations before they put on sackcloth then at any time af<a id="l2922"></a>terward, &amp; the Nations more likely to rejoice at the first mystical killing <a id="l2923"></a>of the witnesses, &amp; to continue rejoicing all the time they were in sackcloth <a id="l2924"></a>then to begin to rejoice at any time afterwards.  So long as the Kings of the <a id="l2925"></a>earth lived deliciously with the whore &amp; the Nations drank of the wine of her <a id="l2926"></a>fornication, so long they rejoiced &amp; made merry at the death of the witnesses.  Their being witnesses in sackcloth &amp; martyrs unburied  may be signified <a id="l2927"></a>by one &amp; the same word μαρτυρες &amp; so may  be taken for one &amp; the <a id="l2928"></a>same thing.</p>
<p id="par123">And thô in allusion to Christ crucified in the streets of the great city <a id="l2929"></a>they are said to prophesy 1260 days or three years &amp; am half, &amp; lye <a id="l2930"></a>dead only three days &amp; an half, yet may these days be really equall to <a id="l2931"></a>the years.  For Christ calls his life time his day (Ioh. 5.56) &amp; Iob the life <a id="l2932"></a>time of the wicked his day Iob 15.20, &amp; Ieremy interprets the day of the <a id="l2933"></a>visitation of Babylon to the time thereof, Ier.50.27, 31 &amp; in the Psalms <a id="l2934"></a>the day of temptation in the wilderness is interpreted to be forty years <a id="l2935"></a>Psal. 95.8, 9, 10, &amp; Ezekiel calls the time of Iuda's prosperity the day of <a id="l2936"></a>their pride Ezek. 16.56, &amp; the time of Iuda's captivity &amp; distress is called <a id="l2937"></a>the day thereof Obad. 11.12, 13, 14. Lament. 1.12, &amp; latter times are <a id="l2938"></a>frequently called the latter days, &amp; the time of judgment the day of judgment &amp; so I take the six days in the creation <a id="l2939"></a>of the world to be put <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>mystically<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> for six long times whether those times be six thousand years as the Tyrrhenian historian in Suidas (in voce Τυ᾽ρρ῾ηνια) affirms, or of other lengths.  For the history <a id="l2940"></a>of the creation is not in all things litteral.  In that Paradise the flaming <a id="l2941"></a>sword &amp; the trees of life &amp; knowledge may be as much figurative des<a id="l2942"></a>criptions of something we now understand not, as the tree of life is in the <a id="l2943"></a>Paradise to come: &amp; in a parabolical description of the creation a day may <a id="l2944"></a>be used figuratively as well as other things are.  How three natural days <a id="l2945"></a>&amp; an half are too short a time for those of the peoples &amp; kindreds &amp; <a id="l2946"></a>tongues &amp; Nations to see the dead bodies of the witnesses in the streets of <a id="l2947"></a>the great city, &amp; for those that dwell in the earth to rejoice over them &amp; <a id="l2948"></a>make merry &amp; send gifts to one another.  These things require a longer <a id="l2949"></a>time, &amp; therefore three days &amp; an half are here put for three times <a id="l2950"></a>for three years &amp; an half &amp; consequently according to the language of Daniel &amp; Iohn <a id="l2951"></a>for three years &amp; an half, for Daniel uses seven times for seven years <a id="l2952"></a>(Dan. 4) &amp; Iohn interprets a time times &amp; an half to be  1260 days Apoc <a id="l2953"></a>12.6, 14, that is three years and an half or so many days as the witnesses <a id="l2954"></a>prophesy.  And this [is still confirmed by the frequent use of a day for a <a id="l2955"></a>yeare, as in Amos 4.4 where three days are in the Hebrew put for three years, in Isa. 61.<a id="l2956"></a>2 &amp; 63.4 where a day &amp; a yeare are used one for another, in Num. 14.34. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p076r"> &lt;76r&gt; </span>  where 40 days are made a type of 40 years, in Ezek 4.5, 6 where 40 days &amp; 390 days <a id="l2957"></a>are used as types of so many years, in Ionah 3.4 where some conceive the <a id="l2958"></a>prophesy of 40 days to have been fulfilled at the end <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>of<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> 40 years, in Apoc 2.20 where <a id="l2959"></a>a tribulation of ten days is put for a persecution of ten years, a per<a id="l2960"></a>secution of ten days (if there were any so short) being too inconside<a id="l2961"></a>rable to be mentioned in this Prophesy.  So also Suidas Grammaticus tells us <a id="l2962"></a>that the Egyptians on the contrary called a day a yeare.   And that the three days &amp; an half <a id="l2963"></a>are so many times or years] may be gathered also from the analogy be<a id="l2964"></a>tween the prophesy of the two witnesses &amp; that of the woman fed in the wilder<a id="l2965"></a>ness.  For these, as true &amp; fals Churches, are related by way of op<a id="l2966"></a>position.  The time of the womans being fed in the wilderness is twice <a id="l2967"></a>described.  First they feed her there 1260 days, &amp; then she is nour<a id="l2968"></a>ished there a time times &amp; an half.  And so the time of the witnesses being <a id="l2969"></a>in afflictions is twice described.  First they prophesy in sackcloth (the <a id="l2970"></a>emblem of mourning &amp; death) 1260 days then they lye mystically dead above <a id="l2971"></a>ground in the sight of men three days &amp; an half.  To the three times <a id="l2972"></a>&amp; an half in that prophesy of the woman the three days &amp; an half do answer <a id="l2973"></a>in this of the witnesses. // Now the killing of these witnesses by the Beast in the begin<a id="l2974"></a>ning of their prophesying <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>is<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>  described in the 13th <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Chapter<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of the Apocalyps. <a id="l2975"></a>For the Beast in respect of his heads as sometimes taken in a large, for the whole dominion of both Dragon &amp; Beast.

<p id="par124">This is the religion &amp; worship of the Beast &amp; Image propagated by the fals <a id="l3006"></a>Prophet into that earth out of which he arose &amp; the true Church in that earth <a id="l3007"></a>overthrown thereby.  For those who were killed for not worshipping the <a id="l3008"></a>Image of the Beast were the true Church of the Earth, because all the <a id="l3009"></a>rest worshipped it, &amp; since all were killed who would not worship that <a id="l3010"></a>Image, their killing cannot be litteral least the true Church case, <a id="l3011"></a>but must be understood mystically of dissolving the bodies Ecclesiastical <a id="l3012"></a>of all their particular Churches by abrogating their government &amp; <a id="l3013"></a>outward form in every City &amp; Town.  For the time of their killing <a id="l3014"></a>they were interdicted buying &amp; selling, &amp; appeared on Mount Sion with the Lamb, &amp; therefore were killed only mystically.  Now all this was <a id="l3015"></a>done before the sounding of the first Trumpet.  For the plague of the first <a id="l3016"></a>vial fell upon the Men who had received the Mark of the Beast &amp; wor<a id="l3017"></a>shipped his Image, &amp; is the same with that of the first Trumpet.  When the servants of God were sealed in their foreheads, then did the wor<a id="l3018"></a>shippers of the Beast receive his mark by way of opposition, &amp; this <a id="l3019"></a>was (as we shewed) between the opening of the Seventh Seale &amp; sound<a id="l3020"></a>ing of the first Trumpet.  Whence you may understand that those who <a id="l3021"></a>are killed for not worshipping the Image are the remnant of the <a id="l3022"></a>woman's seed whom the Dragon at the opening of the Seventh Seale <a id="l3023"></a>went to make war upon, &amp; that their killing is performed in that war, <a id="l3024"></a>the two horned Beast propagating the worship of the other Beasts <a id="l3025"></a>&amp; his Image into the earth which is the Kingdom of the Dragon, &amp; by <a id="l3026"></a>excommunication causing the fire of that war to come down from the throne in the sight of Men.  Whence also you may understand that those <a id="l3027"></a>who are killed in this war are the Martyr Antypas.  For Antipas was <a id="l3028"></a>slain there where Satan dwelleth, that is in the Dragon's kingdom &amp; <a id="l3029"></a>(as the signification of the word implies) is one Martyr for all or a <a id="l3030"></a>single person put for all that were killed.  All the Apocalyptic persons <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p078r"> &lt;78r&gt; </span>  have their mystical bodies, &amp; so Antipas has his, &amp; therefore he is the <a id="l3031"></a>true Church of the Dragon's kingdom mystically slain in the war of <a id="l3032"></a>the Dragon.  For his being conjoyned with the Church of Pergamus &amp; <a id="l3033"></a>with Salam, Balac &amp; Balaam, that is with the woman, Dragon, Beast <a id="l3034"></a>&amp; fals Prophet, shews that he has relation to the history of those four <a id="l3035"></a>described in the 12<sup>th</sup> &amp; 13<sup>th</sup> Chapter of the Apocalyps.  Thus have you the <a id="l3036"></a>Martyrdome of one of the Witnesses distinctly described, &amp; the Martyr<a id="l3037"></a>dome of them both seems to be comprehended in these general words <a id="l3038"></a>that <em class="underline">it was given to the Beast to make war with the saints &amp; to overcome <a id="l3039"></a>them, &amp; power was given him over all kindred &amp; tongues &amp; Nations <a id="l3040"></a>&amp; all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him whose names are not <a id="l3041"></a>written in the book of life.

So then the witnesses are mystically <a id="l3057"></a>slain before they prophesy in the mourning habit of Sackcloth, &amp; <a id="l3058"></a>this is the reason why their Martyrdome is described in the 12<sup>th</sup> and <a id="l3059"></a>13<sup>th</sup> Chapters of the Apocalyps rather then in the in the 17<sup>th</sup> &amp; 18<sup>th</sup>; those <a id="l3060"></a>conteining the rise, these the fall of the Apostacy.</p>

These are <a id="l3072"></a>they who were sealed out of all the twelve tribes, while the rest received <a id="l3073"></a>the mark of the Beast, &amp; therefore they are the whole true Church <a id="l3074"></a>opposed to those unsealed signifying all the rest of the Church in Apostacy <a id="l3075"></a>which tribes distinguished into the two tribes &amp; ten tribes or Church of Iuda <a id="l3076"></a>&amp; kingdom of Israel, being alluded unto in the two horned Beast &amp; ten <a id="l3077"></a>horned Beast; the servants of God sealed out of them are in opposition <a id="l3078"></a>to them distinguished into two Churches called the two Prophets or witnesses.  <a id="l3079"></a>The whole we told you was represented by the two Goats in the Fast, <a id="l3080"></a>sealed in their foreheads by the two lots, the one inscribed To the Lord, the <a id="l3081"></a>other to Azazel.  This word Azazel signifies separation &amp; departing <a id="l3082"></a>away (as Bochardus derives (from the Arabic) &amp; the departing here ty<a id="l3083"></a>pified is from the faith to the worship of fals Gods.  For such Gods (whether the Idols or the Dæmons to which the Idols were dedicated) are in <a id="l3084"></a>the scripture termed Goats Levit. 17.7.  And some Iews tell us that Azazel <a id="l3085"></a>was the Name of one of the Princes of the Devils.  Whence also some ancient <a id="l3086"></a>Hereticks used it as the Name of an evil spirit &amp; so do Conjurers to this <a id="l3087"></a>day, &amp; Iulian the Apostate took it for an evil Genius or Deus averruncus <a id="l3088"></a>to whom the Scape Goat (as he thought) was offered by way of attonement.  <a id="l3089"></a>The wilderness into which this Goat was sent away was the wilderness of the <a id="l3090"></a>Nations or Gentiles spoken of by Ezekiel Chapt. 20.25: which wilderness <a id="l3091"></a>accordingly as the Beast is taken strictly for the dominion of the sea, or <a id="l3092"></a>generally for the dominion of both earth &amp; sea may be taken for one <a id="l3093"></a>or both those regions.  And whereas upon the departure of this Goat <a id="l3094"></a>the other Goat was sacrificed, this denotes that the sealed servants of <a id="l3095"></a>God are sacrificed at the time of their sealing or presently after, <a id="l3096"></a>that is that the two witnesses are mystically killed in the beginning of their <a id="l3097"></a>prophesy.  But whether their killing be complete before the sounding of <a id="l3098"></a>the first Trumpet or not till sometimes after deserves further conside<a id="l3099"></a>ration.</p>
<p id="par126">And since the sealed servants of God, the measured spiritual Temple, <a id="l3100"></a>those that worship therein &amp; the holy city of those worshippers are all one <a id="l3101"></a>with the two witnesses, &amp; consequently the whole true Church in the times of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p080r"> &lt;80r&gt; </span> of the Seventh Seale is comprehended in those witnesses: its evident that in these <a id="l3102"></a>six persons, the Dragon &amp; ten horned Beast, the two horned Beast &amp; the Whore <a id="l3103"></a>of Babylon &amp; the two Witnesses (representing two collateral kingdoms with <a id="l3104"></a>their Churches fals &amp; true) the whole subject of the Prophesy, during the times of the seventh Seale, is comprehended.</p>

<p id="par128">We explained above how the prophesy of the Seventh Seale was de<a id="l3106"></a>scribed seven times, first in the sealed &amp; unsealed Israelites &amp; the <a id="l3107"></a>following Palmbearing multitude then in the seven Angels appearing <a id="l3108"></a>&amp; sounding their Trumpets, next in the mighty Angel roaring like a <a id="l3109"></a>Lyon &amp; in the following seven Thunders, afterwards in the measured <a id="l3110"></a>Temple &amp; two Witnesses, fiftly in the prophesy beginning with the woman <a id="l3111"></a>&amp; Dragon in heaven &amp; ending with the Seven last plagues &amp; <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>pouring out<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the <a id="l3112"></a><span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Vials<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of wrath, &amp; lastly in the prophesy: of the Beast &amp; whore of <a id="l3113"></a>Babylon reigning in the wilderness.  And these seven descriptions <a id="l3114"></a>of the <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>last times are sold<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span>, were the seven Churches of Asia to <a id="l3115"></a>which the Epistles are sent, as I gather from the following reasons.</p>
<p id="par129">First they are to be accounted seven Churches.  For the Church <a id="l3116"></a>Catholick, as we have shewn, was at the opening of the Seventh Seale <a id="l3117"></a>divided into two Churches both true &amp; <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>fals<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>; &amp; to express this division <a id="l3118"></a>the Prophesy which was single &amp; linear during the opening of the first six <a id="l3119"></a>seales, because double in the Seventh being described first in the <a id="l3120"></a>twelve Tribes of Israel &amp; Palm bearing multitude, &amp; then in the seven Angels appearing &amp; sounding their Trumpets.  These are <a id="l3121"></a>the two first Churches which repeated in the Prophesies of the seven Thun<a id="l3122"></a>ders &amp; two witnesses make four, &amp; three of these repeated in the <a id="l3123"></a>general interpretation make seven.  The first Church is the twelve tribes of Israel together with the 144000 servants of God sealed out of them, the second is the saints whose prayers the Angel offers with incense upon the golden Altar, the third is the mystical body of the mighty Angel standing upon the earth &amp; sea, the fourth is the measured Temple of God &amp; they that worship therein, the fift is the woman flying into the Wilderness together with the remnant of her seed, the sixt is the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven  out of which the seven Angels come with the vials of wrath, the seventh is the Church of the saints &amp; martyrs with whose blood the Whore is drunken  called the Lamb's wife which after the fall of Babylon doth make her self ready for marriage.</p>
<p id="par130">Secondly it is to be considered that Asia signifies mud or earth &amp; <a id="l3124"></a>that mountains are the type of Cities &amp; Temples.  And in this respect <a id="l3125"></a>the seven Cities &amp; Churches of Asia may typifie the sevenfold Church <a id="l3126"></a>of the whole earth in the last times &amp; be accounted seven mountains <a id="l3127"></a>opposite to seven mountains on which the whore sitteth in those <a id="l3128"></a>times.</p>
<p id="par131">Thirdly the Angels of the Church to which the Epistles are sent are the <a id="l3129"></a>seven Angels which sound the Trumpets &amp; pour out the Vials, &amp; therefore <a id="l3130"></a>the Epistles respect the times when those Angels appear, that is the times <a id="l3131"></a>of the Seventh Seale, &amp; are sent to the Churches of  which those are <a id="l3132"></a>the Angels.  In the prophesy of the first Church four of those Angels appear <a id="l3133"></a>holding the four winds, in the second they appear all seven &amp; sound <a id="l3134"></a>their Trumpets, in the third the plagues of their Trumpets are repeated <a id="l3135"></a>in the seven Thunders.  In the fourth the two Prophets execute the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p082r"> &lt;82r&gt; </span> plagues of their Trumpets &amp; so are in their stead.  For the seven Angels are the spirit of prophesy &amp; prophesy in those Prophets.  <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>In<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the fift the <a id="l3136"></a>Lamb appears on Mount Sion whose seven Eyes are the seven Angels.  <a id="l3137"></a>In the sixt the seven Angels pour out the seven Vials.  In the last one <a id="l3138"></a>of the seven Angels shews Iohn the Visions in the wilderness.  The seven <a id="l3139"></a>Churches are ready but one &amp; the same Church Catholick seven times <a id="l3140"></a>described &amp; therefore 'tis no wonder if all the Angels be sometimes <a id="l3141"></a>to be <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> with in  one of the Churches.  For so also are all the <a id="l3142"></a>seven <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>stars<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; seven spirits of God to be met with in one of the <a id="l3143"></a>Epistles.  Yet there is some analogy between the several Angels <a id="l3144"></a>&amp; the several Churches.  For the Angels of the first four Trumpets <a id="l3145"></a>which hold the four winds answer to the first four, Churches in the pro<a id="l3146"></a>phesy of the Seales &amp; Trumpets &amp; the Angels of the three wo-<a id="l3147"></a>Trumpets answer to the three last Churches in the prophesy of <a id="l3148"></a>the eaten Book which was litter in the Prophets belly.</p>
<p id="par132">Fourthly it is to be considered that the seven Angels are the spirit of <a id="l3149"></a>prophesy &amp; do prophesy in the Prophets of the la<span class="gap" title="Text is illegible because the manuscript is faded">{illeg}</span>ines &amp; that their pro<a id="l3150"></a>phesy is the <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>priest Ezekiel.  As the seven<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible because the manuscript is faded">{illeg}</span> one Church <a id="l3151"></a>seven times described so <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>their Angels are the one<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> one spirit <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>seven<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3152"></a>times repented.  For <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>they are<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the seven Spirits &amp; for the throne from whom Iohn wishes grace to the Churches &amp; grace is given <a id="l3153"></a>by no Spirit inferior to the Holy Ghost Whence in Epist ad Himesium, c. 1. same purpose. Pope Siricius calls that holy Ghost spiritum septiformem, &amp; others have  written to the same purpose.  They are the spirit which <a id="l3154"></a>speaks to the Churches in every Epistle.  For Christ sends the Epistles <a id="l3155"></a>to the seven Angels to be communicated or preached by them to <a id="l3156"></a>their Churches, &amp; in every Epistle commends the Churches to hear <a id="l3157"></a>their Angels: <em class="underline">He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit <a id="l3158"></a>saith to the Churches</em>.  This Spirit is most most certainly the Holy Ghost, <a id="l3159"></a>&amp; therefore by a sevenfold appearance &amp; repetition of his name is <a id="l3160"></a>called the seven Spirits or Angels.  For they are the seven Lamps in<a id="l3161"></a>terpreted in Zechar. in these words: Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit saith the Lord.  Zech. 4.  They are that Angel or <a id="l3162"></a>Messenger which Christ sent to shew Iohn the Revelation which God <a id="l3163"></a>had given unto him.  For the Angel which shewed Iohn these visions <a id="l3164"></a>(Apoc. 22.8 &amp; 19.10) is called one of the Seven Angels Apoc 17.1 &amp; the other six are the same with him because Christ sent no more <a id="l3165"></a>Angels then one.  Now this Angel must needs be the Holy Ghost, <a id="l3166"></a>because he shewed Iohn this Prophesy, &amp; 'tis the  Holy Ghost by whom <a id="l3167"></a>all Prophesy is given.  'Twas by the operation of this Angel that Iohn <a id="l3168"></a>was in the Spirit on the Lords day, &amp; none but the holy Ghost could <a id="l3169"></a>put Iohn in the Spirit.  'Twas this Angel who in the form of the Son of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p083r"> &lt;83r&gt; </span>   of Man dictated the Seven Epistles to Iohn, &amp; of whom 'tis said in every <a id="l3170"></a>Epistle, He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirits saith unto the <a id="l3171"></a>Churches.  'Twas this Angel of which Christ saith: I Iesus have sent mine <a id="l3172"></a>Angel to testify unto you these things in the Churches &amp; the Spirit &amp; the <a id="l3173"></a>Bride say come Apoc. 22.  This Angel is the Spirit joined with Christ <a id="l3174"></a>the bride in testifying to the Churches &amp; of whose Testimony 'tis said: <a id="l3175"></a>He that hath an Ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.  <a id="l3176"></a>'Twas this Angel of whom Iohn saith, <em class="underline">The Lord God of the Holy <a id="l3177"></a>Prophets hath sent his Angel to shew unto his servants the things <a id="l3178"></a>which must shortly be done</em>, which is as much as to say, The Lord God <a id="l3179"></a>who heretofore sent his Spirit to the Holy Prophets hath sent the <a id="l3180"></a>same Messenger to his Prophet Iohn to shew unto his servants things <a id="l3181"></a>to come.  The Holy Ghost could appear in the form of a Dove or of clo<a id="l3182"></a>ven Tongues &amp; by consequence in any form, as in the form of a Man <a id="l3183"></a>or of seven Men together, &amp; in that respect he might be called the <a id="l3184"></a>seven Spirits &amp; seven Angels or any one of the seven When he inspires the Prophets without appearing to them he is called the Spirit &amp; when he appears in the form of a man he is usually termed an Angel.  As this Angel <a id="l3185"></a>received the Prophesy of Christ &amp; was sent with it from him to Iohn, <a id="l3186"></a>so the Comforter the Spirit of <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>truth<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> spake not of himself, but what <a id="l3187"></a>he heard, that he spake &amp; was sent by Christ to the Apostles to shew <a id="l3188"></a>them things to come.  He received of Christ &amp; was sent by Christ to <a id="l3189"></a>shew it to the Apostles Iohn 16 &amp; in respect of his mission is properly <a id="l3190"></a>called an Angel or Messenger For an Angel Αγγελος signifies nothing els then a Messenger.  So Christ as he is sent by the Father <a id="l3191"></a>is sometimes called an Angel, &amp; so the old Prophets sometimes call <a id="l3192"></a>the Spirit by which they spake an Angel 1 King. 13.18, 2 King. 1.3, 15, <a id="l3193"></a> Iudg. 5.23.  And the Angel of the Lord which appeared to <a id="l3194"></a>appeared to Philip Acts 8.26 is afterwards called the Spirit of the <a id="l3195"></a>Lord vers 29.39.  And in the first six Chapters of Zechary the Spirit <a id="l3196"></a>by which he prophesyed is called an Angel; &amp; in 2 Esdras 7.60 the <a id="l3197"></a>Archangel Uriel (so called 2 Esdr. 4.36 &amp; one of the seven) saith <a id="l3198"></a>They believed not Mose, nor yet the Prophets after him, no nor <a id="l3199"></a>me which have spoken unto them.  And in Tobit one of the seven <a id="l3200"></a>saith,  When thou didst pray &amp; Sarah thy daughter <a id="l3201"></a>in law, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the <a id="l3202"></a>holy one; I am Raphael  one of the seven holy Angels which present <a id="l3203"></a>the prayers of the saints (the office of none under Christ besides the <a id="l3204"></a>Holy Ghost) &amp; go in &amp; out before the glory of the holy one Tob. 12.  And so the <a id="l3205"></a>prophetick Spirit by whom Daniel prophesyed is called the Angel <a id="l3206"></a>Gabriel, I will shew thee saith thy Angel that which is noted in the Scripture <a id="l3207"></a>of truth, &amp; there is none that holdeth with me but Michael your <a id="l3208"></a>Prince.  Michale the Prince of God's people (both in Daniel &amp; the <a id="l3209"></a>Apocalyps) is Christ, &amp; therefore the Angel who saith there is none <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p084r"> &lt;84r&gt; </span>  that holdeth with me in Matters of prophesy, but Michael, can be no Spirit <a id="l3210"></a>inferior to the Holy Ghost.  As God gave Christ the Revelation &amp; he sent <a id="l3211"></a>his Angel with it to Iohn, so  'tis an universal rule that God never <a id="l3212"></a>speaks to us immediately by himself but always by his Son (whence <a id="l3213"></a>his Son is called the word of God) &amp; his Son sends his Messenger or <a id="l3214"></a>Angel the Spirit to reveale to the Prophets what he receives of his <a id="l3215"></a>Father: &amp; besides these two Christ &amp; the Holy Ghost there are none <a id="l3216"></a>other that hold together in Matters of Prophesy.  For otherwise it <a id="l3217"></a>could not be universally true (as it is) that all prophesy is by inspi<a id="l3218"></a>ration of the holy Spirit 2. Pet. 1.21, &amp; that there is but one prophetick <a id="l3219"></a>Spirit.  Now the Prophesies of Daniel &amp; Iohn are of a kind, &amp; the Angel <a id="l3220"></a>which shewed them appears in the same form &amp; shape to both the Prophets: <a id="l3221"></a>whence you may know him to be the same prophetick Angel in both <a id="l3222"></a>cases, &amp; consequently that  the Angel who was sent to Iohn is that spirit <a id="l3223"></a>who alone holds with Michael the Prince of God's people in matters <a id="l3224"></a>of prophesy.  As the Seven Angels &amp; the Seven Spirits are words of <a id="l3225"></a>the same signification, so are a prophetick Angel &amp; a prophetick <a id="l3226"></a>Spirit, &amp; the last is the proper Name of the Holy Ghost.  If all Prophesy <a id="l3227"></a>be of the Holy Ghost much more those of Daniel &amp; Iohn which are the <a id="l3228"></a>principal &amp; especially that of Iohn who expressly saith, he was in <a id="l3229"></a>the Spirit, &amp; therefore the Angel, who was sent by Christ to show it him, &amp; by whose influence he was in the Spirit, can be no other <a id="l3230"></a>then the Spirit of Prophesy.  Nor is there any other representation <a id="l3231"></a>of the holy Spirit in all the Apocalyps then by this Angel &amp; by the <a id="l3232"></a>Seven Spirits or Angels &amp; types the Seven Lamps &amp; seven <a id="l3233"></a>eyes of the Lamb.  So then the holy Spirit being this Angel, &amp; he <a id="l3234"></a>being one of the Seven Angels or Spirits, &amp; consequently all of <a id="l3235"></a>them in a sevenfold appearance, the office of the Seven Angels is <a id="l3236"></a>not only to sound the Trumpets &amp; pour out the Vials, but also to <a id="l3237"></a>prophesy in the Churches all the time of their appearance.  For <a id="l3238"></a>during all the time of their appearance the true Church (in whom <a id="l3239"></a>they prophesy) is represented by two witnesses prophesying, &amp; the office of the witnesses is not only to prophesy, but also to execute <a id="l3240"></a>the Iudgments of the Trumpets &amp; Vials in smiting the Earth with <a id="l3241"></a>all plagues as often as they will.  They are the mystical body of <a id="l3242"></a>the Angels; &amp; therefore have the same office, &amp; do the same things, <a id="l3243"></a>&amp; by their office the office of the Angels is known whichis to prophesy <a id="l3244"></a>as well as to smite the earth with plagues.  Now the prophesy of the Seven Angels is the seven Epistles.  For therefore are they written to the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p085r"> &lt;85r&gt; </span>   Angels that they should teach them to the Churches, &amp; the Churches are <a id="l3245"></a>commanded in every Epistle to hear the Spirit.  These epistles there<a id="l3246"></a>fore represent the prophesying of the Seven prophetick Angels in <a id="l3247"></a>their mystical body the prophetick part of the Catholick Church <a id="l3248"></a>signifyed by the two Prophets.  That Angel is the <a id="l3249"></a>Angel of that Church, because that Church is his mystical body: &amp; that <a id="l3250"></a>Church seven times repeated becomes the seven Churches described <a id="l3251"></a>above, which therefore are the seven Churches of the Angels to which the <a id="l3252"></a>Epistles are sent.</p>
<p id="par133">In the fift place it is to be considered that in the seven Epistles <a id="l3253"></a>together with the morning &amp; evening Sacrifices the dayly worship of <a id="l3254"></a>the Iews is alluded unto, &amp; the worship of Christians signifyed, &amp; that the <a id="l3255"></a>description of this true dayly worship is opposed to the fals worship <a id="l3256"></a>exercised by the fals Churches in the times of the Seventh Seale, and <a id="l3257"></a>therefore relates to those times.  This dayly worship consisted in <a id="l3258"></a>preaching, praying, &amp; praising God whereof the preaching is prefi<a id="l3259"></a>gured by the seven Epistles as was explained in the beginning, &amp; therefore <a id="l3260"></a>the Epistles are a type of preaching the Gospel in the times of the Apostacy, <a id="l3261"></a>which times are those of the Seventh Seal &amp; for that reason they are <a id="l3262"></a>sent to the Churches of those time.  Those are the times of prophe<a id="l3263"></a>sying (as is signifyed by the prophetick Angels then appearing, &amp; by <a id="l3264"></a>the book of prophesy then open in the Angels hand, &amp; by Iohn eating <a id="l3265"></a>the book to prophesy again to the Nations, &amp; by the two prophesying wit<a id="l3266"></a>nesses) &amp; this preaching is that prophesying.</p>
<p id="par134">Sixtly it is to be considered that the seven Epistles allude to the <a id="l3267"></a>dressing of the Lamps, &amp; that they were dressed at the time of the morning <a id="l3268"></a>incense five of them immediately before the incense was offered <a id="l3269"></a>&amp; two afterwards.  Now presently after the opening of the seventh <a id="l3270"></a>Seal, when the Seven Angels of the Churches appear with their Trumpets, <a id="l3271"></a>this incense is offered, &amp; no where els in all the Apocalyps, and <a id="l3272"></a>therefore the dictating of the Epistles to the Angels must respect <a id="l3273"></a>that very time of incense, &amp; those very Angels then appearing.  As <a id="l3274"></a>the dressing of the Lamps preceded the morning Sacrifice, &amp; was a <a id="l3275"></a>part of the dayly worship described in the beginning it may indif<a id="l3276"></a>ferently respect all times, because the dayly worship is perpetual, &amp; <a id="l3277"></a>for the reason above it respects the times of the Seventh Seal in general: <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p086r"> &lt;86r&gt; </span>  <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>As<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> it is conjoyned with the time of incense 'tis limited the time of <a id="l3278"></a><span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>incense<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> immediately following the appearance of the Seven Angels, &amp; <a id="l3279"></a>therefore upon their first appearance <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>is to be incense<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> that the <a id="l3280"></a>Epistles are written to them &amp; sent to the Churches.</p>
<p id="par135">Sevently it is to be  observed that what is declared openly in the <a id="l3281"></a>beginning of the Apocalyps in these words <em class="underline">The revelation of Iesus <a id="l3282"></a>Christ which God gave unto him to shew unto his Servants things which <a id="l3283"></a>must shortly come to pass; &amp; he sent or signified it by his Angel unto <a id="l3284"></a>his Servant Iohn; who bare record of the word of God.

So then the prophesies of <a id="l3304"></a>the Son of Man dictating the Epistle to Iohn and sending him with <a id="l3305"></a>them in a book to the Churches is analogous &amp; Synchronal to the <a id="l3306"></a>prophesy of the Son of Man to prophesying to Iohn in the voices of a <a id="l3307"></a> Lyon, &amp; of the Seven Thunders, &amp; sending Iohn with the book in his <a id="l3308"></a>belly to prophesy before many Nations.  The Son of Man appears <a id="l3309"></a>in the same glorious shape in both cases, &amp; 'tis the same book <a id="l3310"></a>in both cases.  For the book which the Son of Man held open in <a id="l3311"></a>his hand alludes to the book of the Law, &amp; signifies the book of <a id="l3312"></a>the Revelation thereof, &amp; the book in which the Epistles were written <a id="l3313"></a>by Iohn &amp; sent to the Churches is also the book of the Revelation.  <a id="l3314"></a>This Revelation which Christ received of God is twice described: <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p087r"> &lt;87r&gt; </span>  first in the seven Epistles, &amp; then again in the prophesy of the Seales and <a id="l3315"></a>Trumpets with its interpretation: &amp; each of these descriptions is the <a id="l3316"></a>whole Revelation &amp; signifies the whole contents of one &amp; the same <a id="l3317"></a>Book.  I speak not of the Letter but of the Sense &amp; substance of <a id="l3318"></a>the Prophesy.  These Epistles therefore being written by Christ to <a id="l3319"></a>the Angels of the Churches of vertue of that revelation, which God <a id="l3320"></a>gave unto him &amp; sent by Iohn to the Churches must be dictated <a id="l3321"></a>&amp; sent to the Churches after Christ had received the book of that <a id="l3322"></a>revelation of God, &amp; opened the Seales thereof to read the contents, <a id="l3323"></a>&amp; consequently after the opening of the Seventh Seale.  While the <a id="l3324"></a>book was in the hand of God 'tis said that no Man was worthy to <a id="l3325"></a>open &amp; to read the book or to look thereon.  The Lamb took the <a id="l3326"></a>book, that he might open the book in order to read it, &amp; before he <a id="l3327"></a>had opened it he could not read it, &amp; dictate the Epistles to the <a id="l3328"></a>Churches out of the Revelation thereof.  There were indeed <a id="l3329"></a>certain visions appeared at the opening of the first Six Seales, but <a id="l3330"></a>no reading of the Revelation nor dictating out of it could <a id="l3331"></a>be before the Seales were opened.  When Christ had opened the <a id="l3332"></a>book, then he dictated the revelation thereof to the Angel which <a id="l3333"></a>he sent to Iohn or, which is all one, then he dictated the seven<a id="l3334"></a>fold prophesy of the Epistles to the Seven Angels of the Churches, <a id="l3335"></a>&amp; when he gave Iohn the open book to eat &amp; by vertue of it to <a id="l3336"></a>prophesy before many Nations, then he sent Iohn with the reve<a id="l3337"></a>lation thereof to the Seven Churches in the form of Epistles, <a id="l3338"></a>&amp; both these things (the first appearing of the Son of Man with <a id="l3339"></a>the book open in his hand, &amp; the giving Iohn the book to eat &amp; pro<a id="l3340"></a>phesy out of it to the Nations or Churches immediately followed <a id="l3341"></a>the time of the opening of the last Seale.</p>
<p id="par136">It being thus manifested that the Seven Epistles are sent to the <a id="l3342"></a>Churches of the times of the Seventh Seale, &amp; by consequence <a id="l3343"></a>to the Seven Churches of those times described above; in confir<a id="l3344"></a>mation thereof I shall add but one more consideration.  In <a id="l3345"></a>calling the two Churches two Candlesticks &amp; two olive trees, the <a id="l3346"></a>prophesy of Zechary concerning the Candlestick &amp; two olive trees <a id="l3347"></a>is plainly alluded unto.  Now that Candlestick had seven Lamps like <a id="l3348"></a>that Candlesticks in the Temple, &amp; for this reason we are to conceive <a id="l3349"></a>the two Candlesticks to have each of them seven lamps &amp; there is <a id="l3350"></a>the same reason of all the Seven Candlesticks, because they spring <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p088r"> &lt;88r&gt; </span>  from the multiplyed types of the two as was explained in the first of these <a id="l3351"></a>arguments.   Now these lamps, in every candlestick are thus represented.  In the beginning or head <a id="l3352"></a>of the Epistles to the first &amp; fift of the Churches are set down the <a id="l3353"></a>seven stars &amp; seven Spirits of God.  In the beginning of the second <a id="l3354"></a>&amp; sixt Churches appear the Seven Angels.  They appear also in the <a id="l3355"></a>beginning of the seventh when one of the seven Angels leads Iohn <a id="l3356"></a>into the wilderness.  The third Church is a repetition of the Second, &amp; the <a id="l3357"></a>seventh a commentary upon the fourth, &amp; these two the third and <a id="l3358"></a>fourth are most properly the two Candlesticks as was explained above.  <a id="l3359"></a>And thus by the sevenfold light in the head of each Candlestick, <a id="l3360"></a>the seven Candlesticks are known, &amp; these Candlesticks are the <a id="l3361"></a>seven Churches.  The whole Church hath seven lights, &amp; ever <a id="l3362"></a>Candlestick is the whole or at least one of the two Witnesses which <a id="l3363"></a>in a large sense may like the Dragon &amp; Beast whose Churches <a id="l3364"></a>they are) be taken for the Whole.  But as the Angels &amp; Churches <a id="l3365"></a>are numbred in order every Angel hath his Church.</p>
<p id="par137">So then the Apocalyps consists of three main parts the Prophesy of <a id="l3366"></a>the Seales &amp; Trumpets whichis the <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>middle part the interpretation<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> thereof <a id="l3367"></a>which is the last part, &amp; the prophesy of the Seven Epistles which is introduc<a id="l3368"></a>tory to the other two &amp; respects them both those two together making <a id="l3369"></a>up the Seven Churches to which the Epistles are sent.  And all three <a id="l3370"></a>parts respect the last times or times of the Seventh Seal; the times <a id="l3371"></a>of opening the Seales of the book being only introductory to the <a id="l3372"></a>times of the book opened.  And as the dressing of the Lamps in the Temple was <a id="l3373"></a>partly to make them burn clearer &amp; partly to supply them with <a id="l3374"></a>what oyl was wanting so the design of these Epistles is partly <a id="l3375"></a>to illustrate the prophesies of the Seven Churches &amp; partly to supply <a id="l3376"></a>what ever is wanting in them the Epistles answering to the Churches <a id="l3377"></a>in the order they are named.  For by comparing the Epistles with their corresponding Churches you will plainly see that what is mainly <a id="l3378"></a>wanting in the prophesy of every Church is supplied in the Epistle <a id="l3379"></a>to that Church: so that the Epistles are as necessary to the lights of <a id="l3380"></a>their Churches as oyle to a Lamp, &amp; both must be conjoyned to make one complete prophesy.</p>
<p id="par138">In the prophesy of the first Church there appeared but four of the Seven Angels, &amp; 'tis not said upon what occasion a certain number are sealed out of <a id="l3381"></a>all the Tribes, nor what became of the unsealed multitude or what <a id="l3382"></a>was their conditions: but in the Epistle to this Church all these things are supply'd by the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p089r"> &lt;89r&gt; </span>  seven stars in the right hand of the Son of God, &amp; by describing a great con<a id="l3383"></a>flict between the Church &amp; a sort of fals Teachers termed fals Apostles <a id="l3384"></a>&amp; Lyars &amp; Nicolaitans, &amp; by the removal of the Candlestick out of its place <a id="l3385"></a>because she had forsaken her first love.   <em class="underline">Unto the <a id="l3386"></a>Angel of the Church in Ephesus</em> (that is in a state of commotion &amp; remissness) <em class="underline">write, these <a id="l3387"></a>things, saith he, who holdeth the seven stars in his right hand.  I know <a id="l3388"></a>thy works &amp; thy labour &amp; thy patience &amp; how thou canst not bear them <a id="l3389"></a>which are evil, &amp; thou hast tryed them which say they are Apostles</em> (that is <a id="l3390"></a>teachers or Prophets sent from  Christ) <em class="underline">&amp; are not, &amp; hast found <a id="l3391"></a>them lyars</em> (that is fals Prophets:) <em class="underline">&amp; hast born &amp; hast patience, &amp; for <a id="l3392"></a>my names sake hast laboured &amp; hast not fainted.  Nevertheless I <a id="l3393"></a>have something against thee because thou hast left thy first love.  <a id="l3394"></a>Repent or els I will come unto thee quickly &amp; remove thy Candlestick <a id="l3395"></a>out of its place.

<h2 id="hd27" class="cent">Sect. X <a id="l3659"></a><br>The Apostacy of the latter times described in the Prophesies of the old &amp; New Testament</h2>
<p id="par148">By what has been hitherto said it is manifest that the designe of the <a id="l3660"></a>Apocalyps is nothing else then to describe one great Apostacy in the <a id="l3661"></a>kingdom at first represented by the Dragon  &amp; then by the Dragon &amp; Beast together.  The qualities <a id="l3662"></a>of this Apostacy are. // First that its religion is Christian in outward form <a id="l3663"></a>&amp; profession, as we have already shewn by many Characters.  For the <a id="l3664"></a>apostates the fals Churches of the Dragon &amp; Beast represented by the <a id="l3665"></a>two horned Beast &amp; Whore of Babylon, whereof the two horned Beast exercises excommunication &amp; is <a id="l3666"></a>called a fals Prophet, that is a preacher of fals doctrine to Gods people, <a id="l3667"></a>&amp; has two horns like the Lamb whose seven horns &amp; mystical body are the <a id="l3668"></a>Churches of Asia &amp; therefore is a church composed of two subordinate Churches  &amp; Whore in being <a id="l3669"></a>called a Whore is an idolatrous Church, She is that woman who fled <a id="l3670"></a>from heaven into the wilderness &amp; left a remnant of her seed who <a id="l3671"></a>keep the commandments of God &amp; have the testimony of Iesus.  Those Apostates are the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea  amongst whom the <a id="l3672"></a>Devil of idolatry came down &amp; consequently who had him not among <a id="l3673"></a>them before.  They are the Nations worshipping in the outward Court of <a id="l3674"></a>the Christian Temple or Church They are all the Tribes out of which a few servants <a id="l3675"></a>God are sealed, &amp; ten of which tribes are the ten horned Beast &amp; the <a id="l3676"></a>other two the two horned one.  They are the synagogue of Satan who <a id="l3677"></a>say they are Iews &amp; are not but do lye, that is the idolatrous Church <a id="l3678"></a>of the Dragon, who outwardly professe themselves Christians &amp; in<a id="l3679"></a>wardly are not what they profess but do prophesy falsly of themselves.  <a id="l3680"></a>They are Nicolaitans or spiritually fornicating Christians.  They <a id="l3681"></a>are the disciples of those who say they are Apostles &amp; are not but <a id="l3682"></a>do lye, that is who falsly pretend they are Christian teachers of the <a id="l3683"></a>Gospel sent by Christ.  They are the Church of Ephesus at length <a id="l3684"></a>seduced by these fals Apostles, &amp; after seduction represented by <a id="l3685"></a>the Candlestick of this Church removed out of its place.  They are <a id="l3686"></a>those of the Church of Pergamus who hold the doctrine of the Nico<a id="l3687"></a>laitans &amp; against whom <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> threatens to fight with the sword of <a id="l3688"></a>his mouth if they repent not.  They are God's servants in the Church <a id="l3689"></a>of Thyatira whom the fals Prophetess Iezabel seduceth to spiritual <a id="l3690"></a>fornication.  They are the Church of Sardis who is spiritually dead <a id="l3691"></a>&amp; whose people (a few excepted) defile their garments &amp; upon whom <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p098r"> &lt;98r&gt; </span>  Christ threatens to come at the last day as a thief  if they repent not.  <a id="l3692"></a>Lastly they are the Church of Laodicea first grown luke warm and <a id="l3693"></a>then spewed out of Christs mouth.  These are the characters of <a id="l3694"></a>their being Christians.</p>
<p id="par149">In the next place they are a Church very Catholick or universal.  <a id="l3695"></a>For power was given to the Beast over all kindreds &amp; tongues &amp; <a id="l3696"></a>Nations, &amp; all that dwell upon the earth do worship him whose names <a id="l3697"></a>are not written in the book of life Apoc. 13.7, 8 &amp; 17.8, &amp; Babylon <a id="l3698"></a>made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication <a id="l3699"></a>Chap. 14.8 &amp; 18.3, &amp; by her sorceries were all nations deceived <a id="l3700"></a>chap. 18.23 &amp; the last persecution or tryal which the Churches of Smyrna <a id="l3701"></a>&amp; Philadelphia suffer under the synagogue of Satan &amp; their con<a id="l3702"></a>federates, comes upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the <a id="l3703"></a>earth Apoc. 3.10.  And the preaching the Gospel against these apostates <a id="l3704"></a>is as general Apoc. 14.7.</p>
<p id="par150">Thirdly this catholick Church is idolatrous.  For this is many ways <a id="l3705"></a>signifyed, as by the womans being a great whore &amp; inebriating the Nations <a id="l3706"></a>with the wine of her fornication by the fals Prophet speaking as the Dragon.  By their people's worshipping <a id="l3707"></a>the Beast &amp; his Image.  By the name of blasphemy  in the heads of the Beast <a id="l3708"></a>opposite to the name of God in the foreheads of the 144000 saints.  By the <a id="l3709"></a>Devil's coming down amongst the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea with <a id="l3710"></a>great wrath, because he hath but a short time.  By the Angels preaching <a id="l3711"></a>the everlasting Gospel amongst them in these words <em class="underline">Worship God that made heaven <a id="l3712"></a>&amp; earth &amp;c  If any man worship the beast &amp; his Image the same shall <a id="l3713"></a>drink the wine of the wrath of God</em>. By their being called the Synagogue <a id="l3714"></a>of Satan &amp; Nicolaitans, that is spiritual fornicators &amp; being taught by Balaam &amp; Iezabel to eat <a id="l3715"></a>things sacrificed to Idols &amp; commit fornication, &amp; lastly by this  description of their idolatry in the times of the wo-Trumpets.  <em class="underline">By these three <a id="l3717"></a>were the third part of Men killed</em> [that is the third part of all men consid<a id="l3718"></a>ered in the prophesy] <em class="underline">And the rest of Men</em> [the other two third parts] <em class="underline">which <a id="l3719"></a>were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their <a id="l3720"></a>hands that they should not worship Dæmons</em> [or the souls of dead Men] <em class="underline">and <a id="l3721"></a>Idols of Gold &amp; Silver &amp; brass &amp; stone &amp; of wood which neither can <a id="l3722"></a>see nor hear nor walk</em>.  They repented not at God's judgments on <a id="l3723"></a>others for worshipping Dæmons &amp; Idols, &amp; therefore are the three parts <a id="l3724"></a>of Men on whom the plagues of the wo Trumpets are inflicted, did worship <a id="l3725"></a>them before in the times of the fift Trumpet, &amp; those who were not killed in <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p099r"> &lt;99r&gt; </span>   the plague continued to worship them till they perished at the sounding of the <a id="l3726"></a>seventh Trumpet &amp;  great Babylon for her fornication came in remembrance <a id="l3727"></a>before God Apoc. 15.19.  There the people of that Iezabel of whom God <a id="l3728"></a>saith  I gave her space to repent of her fornication &amp; she repented <a id="l3729"></a>not Apoc 2.21: <em class="underline">Neither repented they of their Murders, nor of their sorceries, nor <a id="l3730"></a>of their fornication, nor of their thefts</em> Apoc. 9.21.  By their sorceries you may <a id="l3731"></a>know them to be mystical members of the great Whore by whose sor<a id="l3732"></a>ceries all nations were deceived.</p>
<p id="par151">In the fourth place therefore they were sorcerers, that is addicted <a id="l3733"></a>to pious frauds, fals miracles &amp; jugling tricks in matters of religion, <a id="l3734"></a>using all kinds of fraudulent Arts &amp; delusions for deceiving Men into <a id="l3735"></a>their idolatrous religion &amp; carrying on the interest of their Church.  <a id="l3736"></a>Whence the Whore is said to make the inhabiters of the earth drunk <a id="l3737"></a>with wine of her fornication, &amp; the fals Prophet to deceive them with <a id="l3738"></a>fals miracles; three of which are thus described.  First he makes fire to <a id="l3739"></a>come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, that is by a so<a id="l3740"></a>phisticated excommunication of the Saints, he makes the giddy world be<a id="l3741"></a>lieve them to be reprobates &amp; hereticks.  Secondly he gives breath to <a id="l3742"></a>the Image of the Beast, that the Image should speak &amp; cause all that would not worship it to be killed, that is he inspired an idolatrous Counsel <a id="l3743"></a>(such as was the second counsel of Nice, an Image or representation <a id="l3744"></a>of the people of the Beast taken in a large sense) to decree Idolatry <a id="l3745"></a>&amp; cause that as many as would not religiously obey its decree should <a id="l3746"></a>be expelled the Churches &amp; dissipated &amp; persecuted as hereticks.  This <a id="l3747"></a>is recconed a miracle in allusion to the heathen Oracles who by the <a id="l3748"></a>impostures of their Priests spake as it were miraculously  by the spirit <a id="l3749"></a>of the Gods, to the seduction of the world &amp; advancement of idolatry.  <a id="l3750"></a> To these miracles may perhaps be referred that the fals Prophet caused all men to receive <a id="l3751"></a>a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads.  Of this kind is <a id="l3752"></a>the Cross or Crucifex adored in the right hand for its miraculous powers <a id="l3753"></a>&amp; effect, &amp; the signe of the cross when made with the right hand in the <a id="l3754"></a>forehead or any where els in nomine Pa✝tris et Fi✝lii &amp;  Spiritus ✝ Sancti to <a id="l3755"></a>scare away the Devil, or produce any other supernatural effects.  So the consecrating Images Pictures Holy water, Agnus Dei's, Psalters, rings, Beads wooden crosses &amp; the like by crossing them or touching that with religious or performing any other ceremonies with indications &amp; prayers for endowing them with any kind of supernatural <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 99v &gt; </span>powers &amp; vertues is a superstition of the same kind with the Charmes &amp; spells of the Heathen, &amp; even without a figure may be truly called enchantment &amp; sorcery: as may also the turning a wafer into a man  by the words Hoc est corpus meum.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 99r resumes &gt; </span>  <a id="l3756"></a>For sorcery &amp; magick is nothing else then the making &amp; using <a id="l3757"></a>certain figures &amp; characters with ceremonies &amp; invocations to make <a id="l3758"></a>spirits come &amp; go, appear &amp; disappear &amp; to produce any other <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p100r"> &lt;100r&gt; </span>   supernatural effects.  To make the figures is innocent, but to place a <a id="l3759"></a>supernatural power in them is sorcery be it in any religion whatever, <a id="l3760"></a>&amp; Christians who do so are sorcerers, thô they do not know it.  For sor<a id="l3761"></a>cery  had its rise among the <a id="l3762"></a>many  superstitions of the <a id="l3763"></a>heathen religion &amp; was as well thought of by those that used it as <a id="l3764"></a>Christian superstitions are by Christians.  To their sorcery are also <a id="l3765"></a>to be referred the miracles whereby the fals Prophet &amp; the three froggs deceive men &amp; those spoken of by the Apostle Paul in his pro<a id="l3766"></a>phesy of the apostacy &amp; mystery of iniquity which hee calls the Man of <a id="l3767"></a>Sin.  For that mystery (the mystery on the Whores forehead) beginning <a id="l3768"></a>to work in his time &amp; after the Man of Sin was revealed lasting <a id="l3769"></a>till the Lord consume him with the breath of his mouth  &amp; destroy him <a id="l3771"></a>withthe brightness of his coming, that is till the end of the world, <a id="l3772"></a>can be no other then that one great Apostacy prophesied of in <a id="l3773"></a>the Apocalyps.  And the coming of this mystery, saith the Apostle, <a id="l3774"></a><em class="underline">is after the working of Satan with all power &amp; signes &amp; lying <a id="l3775"></a>wonders &amp; with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them <a id="l3776"></a>that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they <a id="l3777"></a>might be saved.  And for this cause God shall send a strong <a id="l3778"></a>delusion that they should</em> [fall away from  the truth <a id="l3779"></a>&amp;] <em class="underline">believe a lye, that they all</em> [in erring from the faith to <a id="l3780"></a>worship lying Vanities] <em class="underline">might be damned who believed not the <a id="l3781"></a>truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness</em>, or as is expressed in <a id="l3782"></a>the Apocalyps the <em class="underline">all who dwell upon the earth should worship <a id="l3783"></a>the Beast whose names are not written in the book of life</em>.  And <a id="l3784"></a>these miracles are the sorceries of the whore &amp; her confederates <a id="l3785"></a>by which all nations were deceived Apoc. 18.23.</p>
<p id="par152">Fiftly the Apostates  are great persecutors.  For the whore <a id="l3786"></a>was <em class="underline">drunken with the blood of saints &amp; in her was found the blood of <a id="l3787"></a>Prophets &amp; of Saints &amp; of all that were slain upon the earth</em>.  The <a id="l3788"></a>Dragon made war upon the remnant of the womans seed &amp; from his per<a id="l3789"></a>secuting &amp; oppressing the Church he is termed Egypt.  The first Beast <a id="l3790"></a>also made war upon the Saints &amp; overcame them &amp; killed the two <a id="l3791"></a>witnesses or Churches of God, &amp; the other Beast made the Image to <a id="l3792"></a>speak &amp; cause that as many as would not worship it should be <a id="l3793"></a>killed.  These are the great city called Egypt where also our Lord <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p101r"> &lt;101r&gt; </span>  was crucified Apoc. 11, &amp; the horns of the Beast who make war with the <a id="l3794"></a>Lamb (chap. 17.14) &amp; the Beast &amp; Kings of the earth &amp; their armies <a id="l3795"></a>who are gathered together to make war against the word of God <a id="l3796"></a>that sat on the white hors &amp; against his army (chap. 19.19) Whence <a id="l3797"></a>you may understand that they are Antichristians: For they who make <a id="l3798"></a>war against Christ &amp; crucify him in his mystical body are Anti<a id="l3799"></a>christians.  So then the Dragon &amp; Beast with their Churches the fals Prophet &amp; Whore being a real Antichristian state &amp; the only Antichristians <a id="l3800"></a>prophesied of in the Apocalyps, they can be no other then the great <a id="l3801"></a>Antichrist which <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>has<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> to come.  Nor <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>doth<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> it hinder that they are Christian.  <a id="l3802"></a>For Antichrist was to be a Christian state.  For Iohn describing <a id="l3803"></a>the Antichrists of his time whichwere the forerunners of the great <a id="l3804"></a>Antichrist saith, As ye have heard that [inthe last time] Antichrist <a id="l3805"></a><span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>shall<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> come, even now there are many Antichrists, whereby we <a id="l3806"></a>know that it is the [ approaching of] the last time.  <a id="l3807"></a><em class="underline">They went from us but they were not of us for if they had <a id="l3808"></a>been of us they would have conjoyned with us</em> (1 Ioh. 2) which is as <a id="l3809"></a>much as to say that they were hereticks heretofore members of the <a id="l3810"></a>Church  but now departed from it.  And again, <em class="underline">Many deceivers</em> <a id="l3811"></a>[that is not the heathen world but fals Christians or hereticks] <em class="underline">are <a id="l3812"></a>entred into the <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>world<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> who confess not that Iesus Christ came in <a id="l3813"></a>the flesh: this is a deceiver &amp; </em> an Antichrist.</p>
<p id="par153">Lastly these Apostates are guilty of the greatest immoralities as of <a id="l3814"></a><em class="underline">Murders, fornication</em> [] <a id="l3815"></a><em class="underline">&amp; theft</em> Apoc. 9.21.  <em class="underline">Without are dogs &amp; sorcerers &amp; whoremongers <a id="l3816"></a>&amp; murderers &amp; idolaters &amp; whatsoever loveth &amp; maketh a lye</em> <a id="l3817"></a>chap. 22.15.  <em class="underline">The fearfull &amp; unbelieving &amp; the abominable and <a id="l3818"></a>Whoremongers &amp; Sorcerers &amp; all liars shall have their part <a id="l3819"></a>in the lake which burneth with fire &amp; brimstone</em> chap. 21.8.  To <a id="l3820"></a>the same purpose Paul writing of the last times in which Iohn tells <a id="l3821"></a>us the great Antichrist was to come: <em class="underline">This know also</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">that in <a id="l3822"></a>the last days perillous times shall come.

The Apostle here speaks not of a few (such  <a id="l3837"></a>there were in his time) but of a general defection of Christians (in <a id="l3838"></a>respect of faith &amp; manners) to happen in the last times: &amp; this can <a id="l3839"></a>be no other then that one great defection described in the Apocalyps.  <a id="l3840"></a>The coming of this Apostacy, it seems, made a great noise in the Church in the age of the Apostles.

<p id="par156">That Daniel's fourth Beast was the same with Iohns &amp; both <a id="l3923"></a>of them the Roman Empire has been the universal opinion of all <a id="l3924"></a>Christians in all ages some few of the present age excepted.

And in our age somebody under the specious <a id="l3931"></a>pretence of peace &amp; unity, labouring for an accommodation between <a id="l3932"></a>the Reformed Churches &amp; the Church of Rome (that is in plain terms for <a id="l3933"></a>a return of the reformed Churches to the Church of Rome) &amp; for <a id="l3934"></a>this end endeavouring to whiten the Church of Rome, hath revived the <a id="l3935"></a>interpretation of Porphyrius, as if the prophesy of Daniel did not at <a id="l3936"></a>all respect the Roman Empire.  But how extravagant &amp; petulant this fansy <a id="l3937"></a>is may appear by the following considerations.  The Leopard by four heads <a id="l3938"></a>&amp; four wings not for nothing but to signify the four Grecian Kingdoms <a id="l3939"></a>succeeding Alexander the great as Daniel describes them ch. 8.22 &amp; <a id="l3940"></a>11.4, &amp; therefore the fourth Beast which comes after them must be the <a id="l3941"></a>next empire to those kingdoms &amp; consequently the Roman.  This Beast <a id="l3942"></a>is described terrible dreadful &amp; strong above the former Beasts &amp; <a id="l3943"></a>so has the Roman Empire above the former Empires but the Grecian <a id="l3944"></a>kingdoms between Alexander &amp; the Romans were far weaker then <a id="l3945"></a>any of the former.  The number of kings in Syria &amp; Egypt agrees not with <a id="l3946"></a>the number of the Beasts horns.  For before the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes there <a id="l3947"></a>were seven kings in Syria &amp; five in Egypt which make twelve horns <a id="l3948"></a>&amp; not ten as they ought to do.  Neither are those Kings such as horns <a id="l3949"></a>are used in prophesy to signify.  For horns denote always not the persons <a id="l3950"></a>of Kings but the number of Kingdoms in the  Beast: which number <a id="l3951"></a>of Kingdoms was to be found in the Apocalyptic Beast but not in the <a id="l3952"></a>Grecian Empire before the Roman.  And seing the little horn came <a id="l3953"></a>up among the ten (Dan. 7.8) &amp; they were its fellows (vers 20) &amp; <a id="l3954"></a>it humbled three of them, they were contemporary kingdoms &amp; <a id="l3955"></a>so were the ten horns of the Apocalyptic Beast (Apoc 17.12, 16, 17) <a id="l3956"></a>but so were not any ten Grecian Kingdoms before the Roman.  Nor did <a id="l3957"></a>Antiochus Epiphanes root up three of the former ten horns.  The little horn <a id="l3958"></a>being of a different kind from the rest &amp; having eyes &amp; a mouth and <a id="l3959"></a>speaking great things against the most High, that is, being a seer and <a id="l3960"></a>fals Prophet &amp; blasphemous or idolatrous &amp; a living creature upon <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p106r"> &lt;106r&gt; </span>  the Beast, answers well to the woman upon the Apocalyptic Beast, called <a id="l3961"></a>Babylon for her idolatrous doctrine &amp; Iezabel the Prophetess.  This <a id="l3962"></a>living horn reigned a time times &amp; half a time Dan. 7 &amp; so did both <a id="l3963"></a>the woman in  wilderness Apoc 12.14 &amp; her Beast after this victory over the saints Apoc. 13.5.  But Antiochus <a id="l3964"></a>Epiphanes did not so.  He reigned twelve years &amp; polluted the Sanctuary <a id="l3965"></a>but three  years precisely 1 Mac. 1.54 &amp; 4.52, 54.   This horn warred against the <a id="l3966"></a>saints till the time came that the saints possessed the everlasting kingdome, <a id="l3967"></a>Dan. 7.22, 26, 27 &amp; so did the Apocalyptic woman, but Antiochus Epi<a id="l3968"></a>phanes ceased not only long before any Christian Kingdom but even <a id="l3969"></a>190 years at least before Christianity began.  Daniels fourth Beast <a id="l3970"></a>reigned till God sat in judgment &amp; the books were opened, &amp; the Son <a id="l3971"></a>of Man came in the clouds of heaven to receive an everlasting kingdom <a id="l3972"></a>that all Nations should <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>obtain<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; at that time the body of the Beast was <a id="l3973"></a>given to the burning flame, &amp; the rest of the beasts had their dominion <a id="l3974"></a>taken over but their times were prolonged &amp; the kingdom &amp; dominion <a id="l3975"></a>under the <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>whole<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> heaven was given to the Saints of the most High Dan. 8.<a id="l3976"></a>10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22 &amp; so the Apocalyptic Beast reigned till the <a id="l3977"></a>first resurrection &amp; reward of the dead Apoc. 20.4 when the Son of <a id="l3978"></a>Man came in the clouds Apoc 19.11 &amp; at that time the beast was cast into <a id="l3979"></a>the lake of fire &amp; the rest of the kingdoms were slain with the two edged <a id="l3980"></a>sword, that is as to their bodies politic by the taking their dominions <a id="l3981"></a>away while their lives in a litteral sense were prolonged. Apoc 19.20, 21 &amp; then there appeared thrones &amp;  they  <a id="l3982"></a>sat up them  Apoc 20.4, that is  the Saints of the <a id="l3983"></a>most High received the everlasting kingdom.    So you see the analogy between Iohn <a id="l3985"></a>&amp; Daniel is full &amp; accurate, &amp; therefore the Beast is the Roman Empire.</p>

<p id="par158">And as the Apocalyptic Beast was prophesied of by Daniel, so was also <a id="l4006"></a>the Apocalyptic Dragon.

First Philetarus revolting <a id="l4022"></a>from Lysimachus made himself Governor of Pergamus for 20 <a id="l4023"></a>years, &amp; then his brothers Son Emmenes succeeded him.

The history of this Kingdome <a id="l4045"></a>you may see in Strabo lib. 13 Eutropius &amp; others. //  Concerning <a id="l4046"></a>the aforesaid wars; as the Romans on the one hand speak most of <a id="l4047"></a> their own actions therein so <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>on<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the other hand Mithridates King of Pontus (as <a id="l4048"></a>Iustin relates)<sup class="note" id="n62-ref">[62]</sup> said that the Romans were first carried into Asia <a id="l4049"></a>in the ships of this Kingdome of Pergamus, &amp; by their arms more <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p108r"> &lt;108r&gt; </span>  then their own beat Antiochus the great &amp; the Gallogræci in Asia &amp; <a id="l4050"></a>Perseus in Macedon.  And is deserves further to be noted that Florus <a id="l4051"></a>distinguishing the Roman Empire by the changes therein, into suc<a id="l4052"></a>cessive ages, makes the first age to be that of their Kings, the second <a id="l4053"></a>that under Consuls within Italy alone, the third that of their wars <a id="l4054"></a>abroad beginning with the first Punick war &amp; ending with the legacy <a id="l4055"></a>of Attalus, the fourth the following age till Iulius Cæsar, &amp; this <a id="l4056"></a>fourth age in comparison of the former he calls an iron age <a id="l4057"></a>by reason of it's vices &amp; intestine discords.  The three first fall <a id="l4058"></a>in almost with the three first Monarchies in respect of time, &amp; <a id="l4059"></a>the third (which alone of the three deserves here to be considered) <a id="l4060"></a>began about the same time with the Kingdom of Pergamus.  Thus <a id="l4061"></a>the Roman Empire was two headed &amp; by their own recconing a new <a id="l4062"></a>age or Dynasty thereof began when those heads became united.  <a id="l4063"></a>Seeing therefore one of those heads was Monarchichal like the <a id="l4064"></a>Grecian Kingdome, which Daniel by the type of horns &amp; Name of Kings <a id="l4065"></a>had been describing, &amp; to the Romans almost swallowed up the horn <a id="l4066"></a>it came out of &amp; then under the Romans grew exceeding great, <a id="l4067"></a>&amp; the other head was democratical &amp; far remote from the Prophets <a id="l4068"></a>Country &amp; forreign to the Kingdoms he had been describing before: <a id="l4069"></a>no wonder if the Prophet in recconing up all the considerable <a id="l4070"></a>horns of the Goat mentioned this amongst the rest, &amp; described it <a id="l4071"></a>by a little horn growing out of one of the four &amp; waxing great, <a id="l4072"></a>&amp; took no notice at all of the other head before he was led to it <a id="l4073"></a>by the adoption thereof into this.  For in this Prophesy of the ram <a id="l4074"></a>and Goat, as the two successive Kingdoms of the Medes &amp; Persians <a id="l4075"></a>by reason that the latter reigned over the people of both, are repre<a id="l4076"></a>sented by the two horns of one &amp; the same Ram, whereof the <a id="l4077"></a>longer horn rose up first &amp; was contemporary to the Babylonian <a id="l4078"></a>Monarchy; so all the great successive kingdoms of the Greeks were <a id="l4079"></a>most fitly represented by the several horns of the same Goat rising <a id="l4080"></a>up one after another notwithstanding that the Pergamenian &amp; Constan<a id="l4081"></a>tinopolitan was sometimes contemporary or coincident to the Roman <a id="l4082"></a>Empire.  For while the times of the two first Monarchies are comprehended <a id="l4083"></a>in the Ram, 'twas an elegant analogy to comprehend those of the two <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p109r"> &lt;109r&gt; </span>  last in the Goat: Nor is it any objection to say that the kingdom of Pergamus <a id="l4084"></a>fell to the Romans &amp; so ceased.  For if the Medes did not cease to be <a id="l4085"></a>a horn by the <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> of Cyrus, <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> they &amp; the Pergamus though under <a id="l4086"></a>one common King were till the reign of the Greeks represented <a id="l4087"></a>by two horns upon the  Ram:  Much less did the Kingdom of Pergamus <a id="l4088"></a>by its union with the Roman dominions cease to be a horn, seing <a id="l4089"></a>the Romans were adopted into this Kingdom as legal heirs &amp; suc<a id="l4090"></a>cessors of their Kings, Yea the interpretation we have given is al<a id="l4091"></a>together confirmed by that union.  For that it should be thus is a <a id="l4092"></a>part of the Prophesy.  <em class="underline">His power</em>, saith the Prophet, <em class="underline">shall grow mighty <a id="l4093"></a>but not in his own power</em> Dan. 8.24, that is he shall grow great &amp; <a id="l4094"></a>flourish under anothers power, as did the Kingdom of Pergamus under <a id="l4095"></a>the power of the Romans.</p>
<p id="par159">And that this interpretation is true will further appear by com<a id="l4096"></a>paring this Prophesy of the Goat with that of Daniel 11.

And such was the Kingdom <a id="l4108"></a>of Pergamus.  For the four horns were kingdoms situated to the four winds <a id="l4109"></a>Dan. 11.4, that is in respect of Iudea.  Of these the Egyptians &amp; that of <a id="l4110"></a>Syria &amp; Asia were by Daniel called the kingdoms of the South &amp; North.  <a id="l4111"></a>The western was the Macedonian, the Eastern that of Babylonia &amp; Persia.  <a id="l4112"></a>This eastern founded by Seleucus was at first the greatest of all, but after <a id="l4113"></a>a while became united to that of Syria &amp; Asia founded by Antigonus, <a id="l4114"></a>&amp; yet as the united Kingdoms of Media &amp; Persia are represented <a id="l4115"></a>by two horns of the Ram, so are these united ones still to be ac<a id="l4116"></a>counted two horns.  Afterwards by the defection of the Parthians the <a id="l4117"></a>northern horn was left alone &amp; descended to Antiochus Epiphanes.  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p110r"> &lt;110r&gt; </span>  out of this horn came kingdom of Pergamus &amp; soon after the reign of <a id="l4118"></a>Antiochus stood <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>up<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; grew great but not <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>in its own<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> power &amp; took away the <a id="l4119"></a>dayly sacrifice.

Whence Daniel <a id="l4122"></a>tells you that the Prophesy of the little horn was for many days (Dan. 8.<a id="l4123"></a>26) that  is for a very long time, &amp; that it should be in the time of the end &amp; in the last and of the indignation, Dan. 8.17, 19, that is in the end of Gods indig<a id="l4124"></a>nation against the Iews during their captivity.  For so the Prophets use <a id="l4125"></a>the words <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>anger<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; indignation to signify as you may see in Deut. 29.24, <a id="l4126"></a>27, 28 &amp; 31.29 <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span>. 23.10.  Psalm 85.  Isa. 26.20.  Ier. 23.20. Ezek. 5.13. <a id="l4127"></a>Mica 7.9, 18 &amp; other places.  And that Daniel understands it so is plain by <a id="l4128"></a>his saying that the King who does according to his will (that is the arms who <a id="l4129"></a>took away the dayly sacrifice) shall prosper till the end when the <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>indignation<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> be ac<a id="l4130"></a><span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>complished<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Dan. 11.36 &amp; then adding by way of interpretation that when <a id="l4131"></a>God shall have added the <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>dispersion<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of the holy people all these things <a id="l4132"></a>shall be ended Dan. 12.7.

I might add the authority of Antiquity.  For Ierom <a id="l4136"></a>in his commentary on this 8<sup>th</sup> chapter of Daniel tells us that many <a id="l4137"></a>Christians refer this <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> to Antichrist &amp; this Number I find <a id="l4138"></a>Origen Cont. Cels. l. 6 Irenaus l. 5. c. 25.  Effrem Syrus. Epiphanius.  <a id="l4139"></a>And indeed the name of Antichrist seems to have been first taken <a id="l4140"></a>from this horns standing up <em class="underline">against the Prince of Princes</em>.  Lastly <a id="l4141"></a>let those who are for making this horn to be Antiochus <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l4142"></a>consider how little it agrees with him.  For he was no new horn but <a id="l4143"></a>one of the many Kings of an old one.  He did not wax great towards the <a id="l4144"></a>east &amp; south nor grow from a little horn to a great one, but was <a id="l4145"></a>as great at first as at last.  He was so far from growing greater then <a id="l4146"></a>the four horns (as the little horn did) that he was always less &amp; more inconsiderable <a id="l4147"></a>then most of his Ancestors.  He was great in no other power then his <a id="l4148"></a>own.  He reigned not in the time of  the end, nor in the last end of the <a id="l4149"></a>indication.  Nor did he prosper in his practises against the sanctuary <a id="l4150"></a>till the end of his reign but was beaten &amp; bafled by the Iews.  And Daniel himself saith that in his plots &amp; designes to do mischiefe he should not prosper because the end was not then, Dan. 11.27.  He only <a id="l4151"></a>took away the dayly sacrifice &amp; did not cast down the place of the <a id="l4152"></a>sanctuary as the Romans did &amp; as the little horn is said to do Dan. 8.11: <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p111r"> &lt;111r&gt; </span>   nor did the pollution of the sanctuary by him continue so much as 2300 <a id="l4153"></a>natural days, or six years &amp; four months.  It lasted but three years <a id="l4154"></a>from the pollution of the Altar 1 Macc. 1.54, &amp; if it be dated <a id="l4155"></a>Antiochus his taking away the vessels of the Temple which was two <a id="l4156"></a>years before 1 Mac. 1.20, 29 it will be but five years but if <a id="l4157"></a>from Iasons apostacy and setting up a place of exercise for the hea<a id="l4158"></a>then customes (1 Mac. 1.11, 14 &amp; 2 Mac. 4.9) it will be above eight.  <a id="l4159"></a>For Iason did that above three years before Antiochus took away <a id="l4160"></a>the vessels of the Temple 2 Mac. 4.23 &amp; 5.15, 16.  So then the condi<a id="l4161"></a>tions of this little horn do not at all agree to Antiochus, &amp; if he <a id="l4162"></a>be excluded, the Kingdom of Pergamus to whom they fully agree <a id="l4163"></a>must necessarily be admitted.</p>
<p id="par160">The  knot of these Prophesies being untied, which has hitherto been <a id="l4164"></a>been the great stumbling block to Interpreters, you may now by com<a id="l4165"></a>paring Daniel &amp; the Apocalyps together much better understand them <a id="l4166"></a>both.  For now you may see clearly why the throne of Satan that old ser<a id="l4167"></a>pent the Dragon is said to be in Pergamus Apoc. 2 &amp; that this Dragon <a id="l4168"></a>reigning in Pergamus is the Goat's little horn grown exceeding great.  <a id="l4169"></a>As the Dragon that old serpent is the Devil &amp; Satan &amp; signifies a kingdom <a id="l4170"></a>addicted to the worship of Dæmons: so Goats are the type of Dæmons <a id="l4171"></a>or Devils worshipped by Idolaters as you may see in the Hebrew text of Levit. 17.7, 2 Chron. 11.15, Isa. 34.<a id="l4172"></a>14 Whence grew the custome of painting Dæmons in the form of satyrs.  A Dragon &amp; a Goat are types of the same kind, both signifying Dæmons <a id="l4173"></a>&amp; idolatrous kingdoms, &amp; therefore the Kingdom represented by Daniel's <a id="l4174"></a>Goat is in the Apocalyps most fitly called the Dragon &amp; that old serpent <a id="l4175"></a>the Devil &amp; Satan.  Conceive therefore the Apocalyptic Dragon to be Da<a id="l4176"></a>niel's Goat reigning in his last horn &amp; to signify the Greek Empire <a id="l4177"></a>first seated in Pergamus, then growing great not in his own power <a id="l4178"></a>but in the power of the Romans, afterwards reigning apart &amp; lately conquered by the Turks.  Now <a id="l4179"></a>you may understand also that the spiritual fornication of the Kings of the <a id="l4180"></a>Earth with the Whore in the wilderness is the abomination of desolation <a id="l4181"></a>spoken of by Daniel.  For the abomination of desolation is as much <a id="l4182"></a>as to say, the Idolatry of the wilderness, or the abominable Idolatry <a id="l4183"></a>of those who make desolate the people of God, &amp; turn the world into <a id="l4184"></a>a spiritually barren &amp; desolate wilderness.  Now you may also per<a id="l4185"></a>ceive more clearly why the Roman Empire is described double by a <a id="l4186"></a>Dragon &amp; Beast participating one anothers heads &amp; horns.  For seing <a id="l4187"></a>it was double &amp; was so represented by the two leggs of Nebuchadnezzars <a id="l4188"></a>Image, much more ought it be so represented in the larger &amp; fuller Prophesy <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p112r"> &lt;112r&gt; </span>  of the Apocalypse.  In Daniels two visions of Beasts 'tis also represented double, <a id="l4189"></a>the fourth Beast respecting chiefly the western Empire of the Romans &amp; the Goat in the <a id="l4190"></a>in the Apocalyps by the Names of the Beast &amp; the Dragon, as is manifest by <a id="l4191"></a>their horns compared with the Empires.  For the Western Empire was divided <a id="l4192"></a>into ten kingdoms or horns ascribed to the Beast both in Daniel &amp; in <a id="l4193"></a>the Apocalyps, &amp; the Eastern was alwayes solitary or Monarchical as is <a id="l4194"></a>represented by the Goats left horn, &amp; also by the ten horns being uncrowned <a id="l4195"></a>on the Dragons head &amp; consequently not reigning in his proper body.  While the <a id="l4196"></a>Eastern &amp; Western Empires were united the whole was both Beast &amp; Dragon <a id="l4197"></a>with common heads &amp; horns but the horns were then only types of the kingdoms <a id="l4198"></a>into which their people were to be afterwards divided &amp; therefore they are <a id="l4199"></a>not <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>crowned<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> on the Dragon.   Again you may from the comparison of these  Visions learn why in the Apocalyps the region of the Dragon is called the earth &amp; the region of the Beast the sea.  For in Daniel the Beast rose out of the sea &amp; the Hee Goat came from the west upon the face of  the earth.  There is also another reason of this distinction.  For the Iews called the western European regions  the Isles of the Sea, &amp; Asia wherein the Dragon had his throne in Pergamus, signifies the earth.  Lastly you may hence understand what is <a id="l4200"></a>meant in the Apocalyps by the third part of the stars, earth, trees, sea rivers, <a id="l4201"></a>sun, Moon &amp; <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span>.  For the Goat in his horns comprehends all the four <a id="l4202"></a>Monarchies, <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> one third part is the Latin or Western  Roman Empire <a id="l4203"></a>another third part is the Eastern Roman Empire, &amp; another third part the more Eastern <a id="l4204"></a>kingdomes <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>conquered<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> by Alexander the great &amp; so belonging to the Goats <a id="l4205"></a>body but not to his left horn because not conquered by the Romans.  <a id="l4206"></a>For the better understanding of which it is to be observed that as the two horns <a id="l4207"></a>of the Ram continue distinct horns till the end of the Medo-Persian Empire <a id="l4208"></a>notwithstanding their union under one King; so all the four parts of <a id="l4209"></a>Nebuchadnezzars Image continue till the end &amp; then by the stone smiting <a id="l4210"></a>the Image upon its  feet are all of them together (the God &amp; the silver <a id="l4211"></a>&amp; the brass &amp; the Iron) broken in pieces &amp; dispersed, &amp; in the interpretation <a id="l4212"></a>thereof the stone is said to be a kingdom which shall break in pieces <a id="l4213"></a>all those kingdoms signifyed by the Image, &amp; so the four Beasts continue <a id="l4214"></a>till the fourth be cast into burning flames &amp; then have their lives <a id="l4215"></a>prolonged after their dominions of the four beasts were suc<a id="l4216"></a>cessive, yet we are not to end each Beast at the rise of the next, but to <a id="l4217"></a>conceive them all still in being in their conquered  people notwithstanding <a id="l4218"></a>the various changes &amp; intermixing of their dominions &amp; more especially in their proper people &amp; countries which conquered the rest.  So then the Goat <a id="l4219"></a>in a large sense signifies to the end of the world all the kingdoms at any time be<a id="l4220"></a>longing to his horns, that is all the conquests of the Greeks &amp; Romans beginning <a id="l4221"></a>from the times of Alexander the great: &amp; therefore while the Apocalyps in <a id="l4222"></a>the prophesy of the Dragon alludes to this Goat, &amp; this Goat consists of three <a id="l4223"></a>parts, the Beast &amp; the Dragon strictly so called &amp; Persia with the rest of that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p113r"> &lt;113r&gt; </span>  Goats body not conquered by the Romans 'twas natural to call these the third <a id="l4224"></a>part. In calling them so, some whole consisting of all three parts is <a id="l4225"></a>alluded unto, &amp; such is the Goat, the whole subject of sacred prophesy.  The earth or territory of the Dragon's Kingdom, that earth out of which <a id="l4226"></a>the two horned Beast arose is the third part of the whole earth upon <a id="l4227"></a>the face of which all the four Beasts came up, &amp; so of the rest.  In a strict <a id="l4228"></a>sence one third part of the whole is the earth, &amp; another third part <a id="l4229"></a>the sea; but in a large sence the whole is both earth &amp; sea in seve<a id="l4230"></a>ral respects.  Whence in the Vials those regions are called the earth <a id="l4231"></a>&amp; sea which in the Trumpets are called the third parts thereof.</p>
<p id="par161">Now within this Empire the Apostacy rose by these steps, first it <a id="l4232"></a>began in the Apostles dayes to work in the forerunners of the great Anti<a id="l4233"></a>Christ, &amp; was to work in them till his appearance.  Secondly it began <a id="l4234"></a>to work more vigorously at the opening of the first seale.  For then <a id="l4235"></a>the Dragon came down among the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea <a id="l4236"></a>with great wrath knowing that he had but a short time, that is a <a id="l4237"></a>short time to reign amongst them till his being cast in chains into <a id="l4238"></a>the bottomless pitt.  Thirdly after some struggling in the time of that seale between the Dragon <a id="l4239"></a>&amp; the woman,  it arrived to some degree of <a id="l4240"></a>perfection at the opening of the seventh.  For then the woman ar<a id="l4241"></a>rived into the wilderness &amp; the Beast or eighth King rose out of the <a id="l4242"></a>sea, &amp; began his wicked reign &amp; then begins the elaborate sevenfold <a id="l4243"></a>description of the times of the Apostacy by the seven Churches &amp; their <a id="l4244"></a>Epistles.  Fourthly the Apostacy  reigns in its height  in the time of <a id="l4245"></a>the  wo-Trumpets.  For as it is to be conceived that the plagues of the <a id="l4246"></a>Trumpets are proportional to the wickedness of the times, so  the plagues <a id="l4247"></a>of the Wo-Trumpets are described much greater then the rest  Hence the twice times &amp; half a time are to be dated not from the opening of the seventh seale but rather from sounding of the first Wo-Trumpet.  For the <a id="l4248"></a>Beast after his rise out of the sea or Abyss, first makes war with the <a id="l4249"></a>witnesses for some time till he has overcome them both, then he <a id="l4250"></a>continues forty two months (the time of the Nations in the outward <a id="l4251"></a>Court) &amp; the witnesses prophesy as long in sackcloth.  The woman <a id="l4252"></a>first flies into the wilderness, &amp; then in the wilderness she flies <a id="l4253"></a>unto her place where she is fed, that is she arrives by degrees unto <a id="l4254"></a>her place upon the back of the Beast where the Merchants of the earth free her, or under her state of dominion <a id="l4255"></a>where in she grows rich.  Whether the flight of the Eagle through the midst <a id="l4256"></a>of heaven crying Wo, wo, wo, &amp;c may not in some respect allude to the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p114r"> &lt;114r&gt; </span>  period of the flight of the woman upon Eagles wings I leave to be considered.  <a id="l4257"></a>The Apostle Paul tells us that when that which letted should be taken out of <a id="l4258"></a>the way, then should the Man of Sin be revealed, &amp; by the tradition of <a id="l4259"></a>the first Christians the Roman Empire was that which letted.  Now The proper <a id="l4260"></a>symbol of the overthrow &amp; ruin of kingdoms is the smiting of the sun, <a id="l4261"></a>Moon &amp; stars, &amp; this is twice done in the Apocalyps: first at the opening <a id="l4262"></a>of the sixt seale, &amp; then follows the revelation of the Apostacy at <a id="l4263"></a>the opening of the seventh, &amp; secondly at the sounding of the fourth <a id="l4264"></a>Trumpet, &amp; then follows its farther revelation at the sounding of the <a id="l4265"></a>fift.  The first seems to be a succession  of the Apostacy to the Empire in respect of religion, the second in respect of dominion.  The Empire <a id="l4266"></a>falls &amp; the apostacy rises by degrees, &amp; as the Empire falls the Apostacy rises.  For the religion is first taken out of the way <a id="l4267"></a>&amp; then in the wars of the four first Trumpets the earth, sea, rivers, <a id="l4268"></a>Sun, Moon &amp; stars out of the Roman world are gradually smitten, <a id="l4269"></a>&amp; at the same time the Apostacy gradually advances till at the sounding <a id="l4270"></a>of the fift the whore gets upon the back of her Beast, the place where <a id="l4271"></a>she is fed a time times &amp; in half.  </p>
<p id="par162">These things are made yet clearer by comparing the Visions of Daniel <a id="l4276"></a>&amp; Iohn.  For the ten horns being crowned only on the Beasts head do not <a id="l4277"></a>begin their reign before he rises out of the Sea.  At his rise the waters <a id="l4278"></a>out of which he riseth were one undivided Sea &amp; continued so till by <a id="l4279"></a>the wars of the second Trumpet the Sea was turned into blood; &amp; then <a id="l4280"></a>by those wars they became divided into the kingdoms signified by <a id="l4281"></a>those rivers of water on which the plague of the third Trumpet fell.  <a id="l4282"></a>Here we have the ten Kingdoms represented by the horns or some <a id="l4283"></a>of them, &amp; Daniel tells us that the little horn shall rise after them <a id="l4284"></a>&amp; think to change times &amp; laws &amp; that they shall be given into <a id="l4285"></a>his hand untill a time times &amp; the dividing of time.  This is the <a id="l4286"></a>duration of his wicked reign, &amp; therefore beginning sometime <a id="l4287"></a>after the rise of the ten horns it is to be dated  from some <a id="l4288"></a>later Epocha then the sounding of the second Trumpet.  Now this <a id="l4289"></a>interval of the time times &amp; an half is the most signal one in all <a id="l4290"></a>the prophesies; &amp; therefore should have a very signal Epocha, &amp; after <a id="l4291"></a>the sounding of the second  Trumpet there is none other more <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p115r"> &lt;115r&gt; </span>   signal one then that of the Wo-Trumpet solemnized by the voice of the Eagle <a id="l4292"></a>flying through the midst of heaven &amp; crying Wo, Wo, Wo to the inhabitants <a id="l4293"></a>of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three <a id="l4294"></a>Angels which are yet to sound.</p>
<p id="par163">Again in Daniel (ch. 11.40) the reign of the Kings of the South and <a id="l4295"></a>the North is called the time of the end, &amp; the question being put How <a id="l4296"></a>long shall be the end of the wonders the answer is made that it shall be <a id="l4297"></a>for a time &amp; times &amp; half a time.  Now the King of the North who <a id="l4298"></a>comes against the Man of Sin like a Whirlwind with Chariots and <a id="l4299"></a>horsmen &amp; ships &amp; enters into the countries &amp; overflows &amp; passes over <a id="l4300"></a>&amp; reigns till the great tribulation, &amp; then plants the tabernacle of his <a id="l4301"></a>palace between the seas in the holy mountain of delight, &amp; comes to his <a id="l4302"></a>end, is the kingdom of the Euphratean horsmen in the time of the <a id="l4303"></a>Wo-Trumpet.  For this kingdom is the Northern King called in <a id="l4304"></a>Ezekiel Gog of the Land of Magog &amp; comes against the dominion of <a id="l4305"></a> the Apostates with a very great army of horsmen &amp; politically slays <a id="l4306"></a>third part of Men &amp; reigns till the second Wo be past, &amp; then together <a id="l4307"></a>with the Beast at the time of the great tribulation makes war against <a id="l4308"></a>the word of God &amp; his armies in the land of delight &amp; is slain with <a id="l4309"></a>the two edged sword, as we shall shew in the next Chapter.  Now so great <a id="l4310"></a>an agreement in their time &amp; qualities is a sufficient indication <a id="l4311"></a>that they are the same: &amp; thence also the King of the South which precedes <a id="l4312"></a>the King of the North must be the King or Kingdom of the Locusts, <a id="l4313"></a>which precedes that of the horsmen.  For Locusts frequent hot southern <a id="l4314"></a>Countries, &amp; as the King of the South only pushed at the Men of Sin, <a id="l4315"></a>&amp; did not overflow the King of the North; so the Kingdom of the <a id="l4316"></a>Locusts only tormented Men but did not kill them politically as the <a id="l4317"></a>Euphratean horsmen did.  So then the reign of the Kings of the Locusts <a id="l4318"></a>&amp; Euphratean Horsmen in the Wo-Trumpets is Daniels time of <a id="l4319"></a>the end, &amp; therefore this time of the end, that is that interval of the <a id="l4320"></a>time times &amp; half a time begins with the Wo-Trumpets.</p>
<p id="par164">The King who doth according to his will, &amp; whom the Kings <a id="l4321"></a>of the South &amp; North come against, I called the Man of Sin.  For <a id="l4322"></a>to him doth the Apostle Paul allude in saying that the Man of Sin <a id="l4323"></a><em class="underline">opposeth &amp; exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped, so that he as God sitteth in the Temple of God shewing <a id="l4324"></a>himself that he is God</em>.  For all this doth Daniel affirm of the King <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p116r"> &lt;116r&gt; </span>   that shall be according to his will.  <em class="underline">He exalts &amp; magnifies himself above <a id="l4325"></a>ever God &amp; speaks marvellous things against the God of Gods</em> that is <a id="l4326"></a>(as Paul expresseth it) exalteth &amp; opposeth  himself.  Also <a id="l4327"></a> he pollutes the sanctuary of strength &amp; takes away the dayly sacrifices &amp; places the abomination <a id="l4329"></a>of desolation &amp; therefore he sits in the Church or Temple of God, &amp; in magnifying <a id="l4330"></a>himself above every God he shews himself that he is a God.  He prospers <a id="l4331"></a>also till the indignation be accomplished, that is till Christ's second com<a id="l4332"></a>ing as Paul saith of the Man of Sin, &amp; thence you may understand <a id="l4333"></a>that he is the little horn of the Goat grown exceeding great.  For the <a id="l4334"></a>vision of that horn was at the time of the end &amp; in the last end of the indig<a id="l4335"></a>nation Dan. 8.17, 19.  Thence also you may certainly understand that 'tis he that <a id="l4336"></a>takes away the dayly worship &amp; places &amp; abomination of desolation.  <a id="l4337"></a>For this is the Idolatry of the wilderness in the Apocalyps placed during  the great Apostacy <a id="l4338"></a>by the Man of Sin.  I here take the Man of Sin &amp; the King that doth <a id="l4339"></a>according to his will in a large sence for the whole Apostacy.  <a id="l4340"></a>For in such a large sence the Dragon is  sometimes taken, so <a id="l4341"></a>as to comprehend the Beast, as you may understand by the ten horns <a id="l4342"></a>of the Beast being also planted upon his head.  And in the same large <a id="l4343"></a>sence is the Beast sometimes taken so as to comprehend the Dragon <a id="l4344"></a>as we shewed above, &amp; then the wilderness is taken in a sence as <a id="l4345"></a>large.  Now considering that this Man of Sin begins his wicked reign <a id="l4346"></a>at the opening of the Seventh Seale, &amp; doth according to his will for <a id="l4347"></a>some time before the time of the end wherein the King of the South <a id="l4348"></a>&amp; North push at him &amp; come against him, it confirms to us that the <a id="l4349"></a>time of the end begins sometimes after the opening of the seventh <a id="l4350"></a>Seale, &amp; so suits well with the time of the Wo-Trumpets.  All the <a id="l4351"></a>wars of those Trumpets are plagues inflicted upon this Man of <a id="l4352"></a>Sin &amp; those of the Wo-Trumpets are the greatest.  Now such plagues <a id="l4353"></a>also are the wars of the Kings of the South &amp; North against him &amp; <a id="l4354"></a>while Daniel describes only these two together with the fall of the <a id="l4355"></a>King of the North, the time of trouble &amp; deliverance of the Saints <a id="l4356"></a>by Michael which is a third, no doubt these three are the three greatest <a id="l4357"></a>plagues &amp; consequently the plagues of the three wo-trumpets espe<a id="l4358"></a>cially since the third is evidently the plague of the third Wo-trum<a id="l4359"></a>pet, &amp; the two first precede it in continual order.</p>
<p id="par165"><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p117r"> &lt;117r&gt; </span>   The times of this prophesy of the Scripture of truth being stated we <a id="l4360"></a>may now be comparing it with other prophesies understood it better.  And <a id="l4361"></a>because we are now describing the Apostacy of the latter times, &amp; this <a id="l4362"></a>prophesy is the fullest description thereof in all Daniel, it will <a id="l4363"></a>not be amiss now to explain a little further.</p>
<p id="par166">As the prophesy of the four Beasts is a commentary on that of <a id="l4364"></a>Nebuchadnezzars image, so this Prophesy of the Scripture of truth <a id="l4365"></a>is nothing else then a commentary on that of the Ram &amp; Goat.  First <a id="l4366"></a>the prophetic Angel names these two Beasts or Kingdoms of the Ram <a id="l4367"></a>&amp; Goat in these words, <em class="underline">I will return</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">to fight with the <a id="l4368"></a>Prince of Persia, &amp; when I am gone forth to the Prince of <a id="l4369"></a>Greece shall come</em>.  Then he shews how the King of Persia shall <a id="l4370"></a>make war upon the King of Greece, &amp; how a mighty King of <a id="l4371"></a>Greece  (the first horn of the Goat) shall stand up, &amp; his <a id="l4372"></a>kingdom be broken off &amp; divided towards the four winds of heaven <a id="l4373"></a>but not to this posterity nor according to the greatness of his do<a id="l4374"></a>minion.  These are the four horns of the Goat which rose up when <a id="l4375"></a>the first &amp; greatest horn was broken off.  Then he tells the history <a id="l4376"></a>of the Kings of two of these horns (the southern &amp; the northern) <a id="l4377"></a>down to the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes, as Interpreters have <a id="l4378"></a>sufficiently explained.  And of Antiochus &amp; the King of the south <a id="l4379"></a>he tells us that <em class="underline">their hearts shall be to do mischiefe, &amp; they shall <a id="l4380"></a>speak lies at one table, but it shall not prosper because the end <a id="l4381"></a>is not yet</em> (Dan. 11.27) which is as much as to say that Antiochus <a id="l4382"></a>is not the little horn of the Goat.  For that horn reigns in the time of <a id="l4383"></a>the end &amp; in the last end of the indignation, &amp; casts down the truth <a id="l4384"></a>to the ground, &amp; destroys wonderfully, &amp; practises &amp; prospers, &amp; through <a id="l4385"></a>his policy causes craft to prosper in his hand (Dan. 8.12, 17, 19, 24, 25)  Daniel therefore after he has declared that Antiochus is not <a id="l4386"></a>that King who reigns in the end nor doth prosper in his designs,  <a id="l4387"></a>mentions in the next place his unprosperous indignation against the <a id="l4388"></a>holy covenant, &amp; then passes on to describe the little prosperous horn.  <a id="l4389"></a><em class="underline">And out of him</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">arms shall stand up, &amp; they shall pollute <a id="l4390"></a>the sanctuary of strength, &amp; shall take away the daily worship, <a id="l4391"></a>&amp; shall place the abomination which maketh desolate</em>.</p>
<p id="par167">It may seem at first sight that this taking away of the daily sacrifice <a id="l4392"></a>or worship might have some relation to the desolation of the Iewish Temple <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p118r"> &lt;118r&gt; </span>  by the Romans.  And to make this suspition the more plausible it may <a id="l4393"></a>be alledged that the Law was not abrogated by Christ's death.  He <a id="l4394"></a>came not to dissolve the Law but to fulfill it.  Some part of it is not <a id="l4395"></a>yet fulfilled, &amp; therefore not abrogated, &amp; the which he did fulfill <a id="l4396"></a>by his passion was not thereby abrogated, because it might  as <a id="l4397"></a>reasonably be observed afterwards in commemoration of his passion <a id="l4398"></a>as it was before in prediction of it.  Types are of an eternal nature, being as fit to represent things past as things to come &amp; therefore are not abrogated by their being fulfilled, but require as positive a comand for their abrogation as their was for their institution.  Paul tells us that we do not <a id="l4399"></a>make void the Law through faith Rom. 3.31, &amp; that the Law is not sin <a id="l4400"></a>(ch. 7.7) but holy &amp; good (vers 12,16, &amp; 1 Tim. 1.8) &amp; that circumcision <a id="l4401"></a>profiteth if one keep the Law Rom. 2.25, &amp; that every man that is <a id="l4402"></a>circumcised is a debter to the whole law, Gal. 5.3.  For circumcision is <a id="l4403"></a>the seale of a covenant to keep the law, &amp; every covenant to do any <a id="l4404"></a>thing which in it self is indifferent or not unlawfull is obligatory <a id="l4405"></a>&amp; binding &amp; cannot be broken without sin.  Whence the first Christians <a id="l4406"></a>of the circumcision were all zealous of the law, the Apostles even Paul <a id="l4407"></a>himself kept the law as long as the Temple stood, as you may see by <a id="l4408"></a>several instances in the Acts of the Apostles.  Amongst the Gentiles they <a id="l4409"></a>had a dispensation to convers as the Gentiles for the Gospel's sake, but <a id="l4410"></a>amongst the Iews the Apostle Paul himself was a Iew &amp; accordingly he <a id="l4411"></a>commands, If any man be circumcised, let him not become uncircumcised.  <a id="l4412"></a>And if he any where speak of the law as dissolved or abrogated, he <a id="l4413"></a>doth it in one of these respects, either because the abrogation of it by <a id="l4414"></a>the destruction of the Temple was at hand, or because it was not required <a id="l4415"></a>that the converted Gentiles should by circumcision bind themselves to the <a id="l4416"></a>observance of it, or because the putting trust &amp; confidence in it and <a id="l4417"></a>resting upon the fulfilling of it for justification was abrogated by <a id="l4418"></a>faith in Christ.  The Iews were bound to observe it by vertue of <a id="l4419"></a>their covenant of circumcision, but were not to lay the stress of their <a id="l4420"></a>Iustification &amp; Salvation upon the observance of it; because that was to <a id="l4421"></a>frustrate &amp; make void the faith in Christ.  And the Gentiles were not <a id="l4422"></a>to be circumcised in order to Salvation, because that was to lay the stress <a id="l4423"></a>of their Salvation upon the law, &amp; thereby make void the faith in Christ, by which alone he is to be saved.  This is the sence &amp; summ of <a id="l4424"></a>Paul's discourses on this matter.  For that he means nothing more you <a id="l4425"></a>may know by this circumstance, that in the law he disputes against, he includes <a id="l4426"></a>the ten Commandments, as you may see in Rom. 2.21, 25 &amp; 7.7. Gal. 5.14 <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p119r"> &lt;119r&gt; </span>  1 Tim. 1.9, 10.  For he doth not mean that the ten commandments are all <a id="l4427"></a>of them abrogated but only that our Iustification by the observance of <a id="l4428"></a>them is abrogated by faith.  So then the Law continuing in force to <a id="l4429"></a>the Iews at least till the destruction of the Temple by the Romans, it may seem <a id="l4430"></a>reasonable to think that Daniel in predicting the taking away of the daily sacrifice might have some respect to that destruction of the <a id="l4431"></a>Temple: &amp; that the rather because the worship was not only ceremonial <a id="l4432"></a>but also spiritual consisting in praying &amp; adoring God, not only by the <a id="l4433"></a>unbeleiving Iews but also by the beleiving. Daniel was a Iew &amp; so the <a id="l4434"></a>more likely to have some respect to the nation of the Iews.  But yet <a id="l4435"></a>when I consider that the Iewish Nation upon the calling of the  Gen<a id="l4436"></a>tiles was rejected the few beleivers only excepted; that the worship in the <a id="l4437"></a>Temple was performed by the unbeleivers, &amp; therefore not acceptable <a id="l4438"></a>to God unless so far as the beleivers were concerned in it, that the worship <a id="l4439"></a>of the beleivers there consisted mainly in praying &amp; praising God, <a id="l4440"></a>&amp; so the same with that of the Christians in Synagogues &amp; Churches all <a id="l4441"></a>over the world, &amp; ceased not by the destruction of the Temple,  that the <a id="l4442"></a>host of heaven which the little horn of the Goat cast down to the ground, &amp; <a id="l4443"></a>together with the sanctuary trade under foot are Christians &amp; therefore <a id="l4444"></a>the daily worship here spoken of is Christian, &amp; that the abomination or <a id="l4445"></a>transgression of desolation was placed in the sanctuary a long time <a id="l4446"></a>even untill the cleansing of the Sanctuary, which cannot be understood <a id="l4447"></a>of the Temple all these things incline me to think that nothing els then the Christian daily sacrifice or worship in their synagogues or Churches (collectively called the sanctuary) is here intended &amp; I am confirmed in this opinion by comparing these visions with the Apocalyps as follows.</p>
<p id="par168">In the prophesy of the Goat, the little horn first <em class="underline">waxed great toward <a id="l4448"></a>the South &amp; toward the East &amp; toward the land of delight</em> by the incorpo<a id="l4449"></a>ration of the Romans &amp; the growth of their Empire, then it <em class="underline">waxed great</em> <a id="l4450"></a>to [or against] <em class="underline">the half of heaven &amp; cast down of the host &amp; of the <a id="l4451"></a>stars to the ground &amp; stamped upon them</em>.  As it made war upon the <a id="l4452"></a>South &amp; the East &amp; the pleasant land for enlarging its dominion, so now <a id="l4453"></a>it made war upon the host of heaven &amp; cast down of the stars to the <a id="l4454"></a>ground.  And this came to pass when the woman in heaven was pained <a id="l4455"></a>in travail of a Manchild, &amp; the Dragon drew the third part of the stars <a id="l4456"></a>of heaven, &amp; cast them to the Earth.  Then the horn <em class="underline">magnified himself <a id="l4457"></a>to</em> [or against] <em class="underline">the Prince of the host</em>: &amp; this came to pass when the Dragon <a id="l4458"></a>&amp; his Angels made war against Michael (the Prince of the host) &amp; his Angels <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p120r"> &lt;120r&gt; </span>  <em class="underline">Then by him the daily worship was taken away &amp; the place of his same <a id="l4459"></a><span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Mary<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> cast down, &amp; an host was given him against the daily worship <a id="l4460"></a>by reason of transgression, &amp; it cast down the truth to the ground, &amp; it <a id="l4461"></a>practised &amp; prospered</em>.  And this came to pass by the Dragon's coming down <a id="l4462"></a>amongst the inhabitants of the earth &amp; sea with great wrath, &amp; beginning <a id="l4463"></a>to prevail &amp; take away the daily worship at the opening of the seventh <a id="l4464"></a>seale, &amp; completely casting down the truth to the ground &amp; setting up <a id="l4465"></a>the abomination of desolation at or before the sounding of the first wo-<a id="l4466"></a>Trumpet.  For against the host or Church of heaven an host or fals Church <a id="l4467"></a>was given him when the two horned Beast rose out of the earth &amp; the <a id="l4468"></a>Woman fled into the Wilderness.  The worship he &amp; his host took away is the daily sacrifice described in the first five chapters of the Apocalyps as we explained in the ✝ <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> section of this Treatise.  The idolatrous worship sett up by his <a id="l4469"></a>host, that is the worship of the Beast &amp; his Image set up by the two horned <a id="l4470"></a>beast &amp; the Whoredom of the woman in the wilderness is the abomination <a id="l4471"></a>of desolation.  They that embrace it are called the abominable Apoc. 21.8, <a id="l4472"></a>&amp; therefore 'tis the abomination of the wilderness or as Daniel expresseth <a id="l4473"></a>it, the abomination of desolation.  This worship the host begins to set up <a id="l4474"></a>at or soon after the opening of the seventh seale.  Then follows a war <a id="l4475"></a>of the Dragon &amp; Beast against the <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>two<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> witnesses, &amp; when they are overcome <a id="l4476"></a>&amp; slain &amp; put on the mourning habit of sackcloth, that is <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>at<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the beginning <a id="l4477"></a>of the thousand two hundred &amp; sixty days or sounding of the first wo-trumpet, <a id="l4478"></a>the truth is fully cast down to the ground, &amp; the abomination com<span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l4479"></a>set up in place of the daily worship.

<p id="par171">By what has <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>been<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> said it is manifest that the end of the <a id="l4551"></a>world is described in the last Chapter of Daniel newly explained.  <a id="l4552"></a>For there is predicted the  resurrection of the dead, and that <a id="l4553"></a>in such a manner that it cannot be interpreted allegorically.  <a id="l4554"></a>'Tis said that they who sleep in the dust shall rise again some <a id="l4555"></a>to reward and some to punishment and Daniel himself in per<a id="l4556"></a>son is named for one of those who shall then rise again.  At <a id="l4557"></a>that time is also predicted the end of the King of the North <a id="l4558"></a>the fall of the great Apostacy, the return of the Iewish cap<a id="l4559"></a>tivity and the great tribulation, and therefore in describing <a id="l4560"></a>the end of the world we are now to give an account of these things as the immediate forerunners thereof.  The periods of time we have in Daniel, but the order of the things is more distinctly described in the Apocalyps, and by com<a id="l4561"></a>paring them together we shall better understand them both.  <a id="l4562"></a>Now in the Apocalyps the fall of the Apostasy is described <a id="l4563"></a>by these steps.</p>
<p id="par172">At the end of the 120 days the ten Kings burn the whore <a id="l4564"></a>of Babylon, and at the same time the spirit of life enters <a id="l4565"></a>into the two witnesses, Prophets or Preachers, and they stand <a id="l4566"></a>upon their feet, and ascend up to heaven in a cloud of con<a id="l4567"></a>verts, or as is exprest in the fift Church, <em class="underline">An Angel flies <a id="l4568"></a>in the midst of heaven having the everlasting Gospel to <a id="l4569"></a>preach</em> [or testify] <em class="underline">unto them that dwell on the earth and <a id="l4570"></a>to every Nation &amp; kindred and tongue &amp; people, saying with <a id="l4571"></a>a loud voice, Hear God &amp; give glory to him, for the hour of his <a id="l4572"></a>judgment</em> [of the great Whore] <em class="underline">is come &amp;</em> [worship no longer the Beast <a id="l4573"></a>&amp; his Image but] <em class="underline">worship him that made heaven &amp; earth &amp; the sea &amp; the <a id="l4574"></a>fountains of Waters.  This is the preaching of the</em> Gospel to all Nations spoken <a id="l4575"></a>of in Matthew chap. 24 &amp; the Nations now to be converted are the <a id="l4576"></a>fullness of the Gentiles to come in at the end of the Iewish captivity when <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p124r"> &lt;124r&gt; </span>   all Israel shall be converted and saved, as Paul describes <a id="l4577"></a>Rom. 11.25.</p>
<p id="par173">In the next place follows the second fall of Babylon called the fall <a id="l4578"></a>of the tenth part of the great city &amp; proclaimed both in the fift &amp; in the <a id="l4579"></a>seventh Church, saying <em class="underline">Babylon is fallen is fallen</em> &amp;c.  And this <a id="l4580"></a>fall is followed with the conversion of a greater multitude: as is thus <a id="l4581"></a>briefly exprest in the fourth Church; <em class="underline">The remnant were affrighted <a id="l4582"></a>&amp; gave glory to God</em>, &amp; in the seventh Church is thus described at <a id="l4583"></a>large – <em class="underline">After these things</em> [that is after the second fall of Babylon] <a id="l4584"></a><em class="underline">I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Allelujah <a id="l4585"></a>salvation &amp; glory &amp; honour &amp; power unto the Lord out God, For <a id="l4586"></a>true &amp; righteous are his judgments; For he hath judged the great <a id="l4587"></a>Whore</em> &amp;c.  At the same time also are the Iews converted which return <a id="l4588"></a>from captivity as I gather from the next words.  <em class="underline">And the four &amp; <a id="l4589"></a>twenty Elders &amp; the four Beasts fell down &amp; worshipped God that <a id="l4590"></a>sat on the throne saying, Amen, Allelujah</em>.  For I told you that in the <a id="l4591"></a>worship of God in the Temple, the Christian Iews are described by the Elders <a id="l4592"></a>&amp; Beasts &amp;  the Christian Gentiles by all the Angels round about the <a id="l4593"></a>throne &amp; round about the Beast &amp; the Elders &amp; that by the falling down <a id="l4594"></a>of the one or the other, &amp; worshipping God, the conversion of the Iews <a id="l4595"></a>or Gentiles is signified.</p>
<p id="par174">In the next place come three unclean spirits like frogs (croaking <a id="l4596"></a>Spirits of deceivers out of the Mouths of the Dragon, Beast &amp; fals <a id="l4597"></a>Prophet working miracles to seduce the Kings of the earth, and of the <a id="l4598"></a>whole world, &amp; to gather them to the battle of the great day of God <a id="l4599"></a>Almighty, perswading them perhaps that the new converted Iews are <a id="l4600"></a>the great Antichrist which was to come in the end of the world and reign <a id="l4601"></a>at Ierusalem, &amp; that the reformed Christians all over the world of their <a id="l4602"></a>Communion are Antichristians, &amp; by such pretences &amp; their fals miracles <a id="l4603"></a>seducing many to the worship of the Beast &amp; his Image.  At the same time <a id="l4604"></a>therefore it is to be conceived that in the fift Church the third Angel <a id="l4605"></a>flies through the midst of heaven, <em class="underline">saying, with a loud voice: If any <a id="l4606"></a>man worship the Beast &amp; his Image &amp; receive his mark in his forehead, or in <a id="l4607"></a>his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God</em> &amp;c.  By the voice of <a id="l4608"></a>this &amp; the two former Angels understand the voice of those that preach <a id="l4609"></a>the Gospel.  Whether the three frogs are opposed to the three Angels <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p125r"> &lt;125r&gt; </span>  and so come forth successively or come forth all together at the flight <a id="l4610"></a>of the third Angel time will discover.</p>
<p id="par175">In the next place follows the time of trouble or great tribulation <a id="l4611"></a>spoken of by Daniel &amp; Christ in Matthews Gospel, &amp; described in the <a id="l4612"></a>prophesies of all the seven Churches.  For this is the great tribulation <a id="l4613"></a>out of which the Palm-bearing Multitude come in the first Church, the <a id="l4614"></a>tribulation of ten days or prophetick years in the Epistle to the second <a id="l4615"></a>Church, the war in which Christ fights against the Nicolaitans with the sword <a id="l4616"></a>of his mouth in the Epistle to the third Church, &amp; the anger of the <a id="l4617"></a>Nations in the fourth Church at the sounding of the seventh Trumpet, <a id="l4618"></a>thus described: <em class="underline">And the Nations were angry &amp; thy wrath</em> [against <a id="l4619"></a>them] <em class="underline">is come &amp; the time of the dead that they should be judged &amp; that <a id="l4620"></a>thou shouldest give the reward unto thy servants the Prophets &amp; to <a id="l4621"></a>the saints &amp; them that fear thy Name small &amp; great, &amp; shouldest <a id="l4622"></a>destroy them</em> [the Beast &amp; fals Prophet &amp; Kings of the Nations] <a id="l4623"></a><em class="underline">which</em> [in the great tribulation] <em class="underline">destroy the earth</em>.  This anger &amp; <a id="l4624"></a>destruction of the angry Nations is that war to which the seventh Trum<a id="l4625"></a>pet sounds described at large in the seventh  Church be<a id="l4626"></a>tween the armies in  heaven &amp; the armies of the Beasts &amp; kings of the earth.  In the fift Church the tribulation is ushered in by this <a id="l4627"></a>acclamation; Here is the patience of the saints, here are they <a id="l4628"></a>that keep the Commandments of God, – Blessed are the dead which <a id="l4629"></a>dye in the Lord, &amp; then is described by the harvest whereof the <a id="l4630"></a>hundred &amp; forty four thousand Saints are called the first <a id="l4631"></a>fruits.  In the sixt Church 'tis involved in the battel of the great <a id="l4632"></a>day of God Almighty to which the three frogs gather the Nations: <a id="l4633"></a>&amp; in the Epistle to this church 'tis called the hour of tentation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth.  <a id="l4634"></a>In the seventh Church it is involved in the war between the two <a id="l4635"></a>armies &amp; delineated by the Angel standing in the Sun.  For this <a id="l4636"></a>is a type of the same kind with the Womans being cloathed with <a id="l4637"></a>the Sun.  The mystical body of the Angel is the Church, &amp; the Sun <a id="l4638"></a>is the aggregate of kingdoms through which the Church is diffused <a id="l4639"></a>&amp; who by his great heat scorches &amp; burns her, that is makes war <a id="l4640"></a>upon her in this  persecution head &amp; fire being the symbols <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p126r"> &lt;126r&gt; </span>  of war: &amp; the loud voice of this Angel saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come &amp; gather your selves together unto <a id="l4641"></a>the supper of the great God, that ye may eat the flesh of kings, &amp;c, <a id="l4642"></a>is the voice of the Church crying for vengeance.  This voice is the <a id="l4643"></a>same with that of the Angel in the fift Church who came out from <a id="l4644"></a>the Altar &amp; had power over the fire that is over the fire of the <a id="l4645"></a>Alter where the Martyrs were sacrificed) &amp; cried with a loud cry <a id="l4646"></a>to him that had the sharp sickle saying thrust in thy sharp sickle <a id="l4647"></a>to gather the clusters of the Vine of the Earth.</p>
<p id="par176">In the last place follows at the end of the great tribulation an universal <a id="l4648"></a>Victory of the Church over all  the persecuting Nations, &amp; this is described <a id="l4649"></a>in Matthew &amp; the old Prophets by the smiting of the Sun, Moon &amp; stars, <a id="l4650"></a>&amp; sometimes by other modes of speaking &amp; in the Apocalyps in the first <a id="l4651"></a>of the seven Churches by the coming of the Palm-bearing multitude out <a id="l4652"></a>of the great tribulation, at which time all the Angels fall down before the <a id="l4653"></a>throne &amp; worship God, that is the Nations are universally converted.  In <a id="l4654"></a>the Epistle to the second Church by this exhortation; Be thou faithful unto <a id="l4655"></a>death &amp; I will give thee a crown of life; in the third Church by the <a id="l4656"></a>finishing of the great mystery of God spoken of by the old Prophets; in <a id="l4657"></a> the fourth by the kingdoms of this world becoming the kingdoms of God <a id="l4658"></a>&amp; his Christ at the sounding of the seventh Trumpet; in the fift by the <a id="l4659"></a>Vintage &amp; treading of the great wine-press of the wrath of God; in the <a id="l4660"></a>sixt by the voice at the pouring out of the last Vial, saying, It is done, <a id="l4661"></a>&amp; by the concomitant voices &amp; thunders &amp; lightnings &amp; a greater <a id="l4662"></a>earthquake then ever was before upon the face of the earth, &amp; an ex<a id="l4663"></a>ceding great hail the plague of  which caused men to blaspheme <a id="l4664"></a>God &amp; Babylon's coming then in remembrance before God to give <a id="l4665"></a>unto her the cup of the wind of the fierceness of his wrath: &amp; in the Epistle <a id="l4666"></a>to this Church, by the door of the kingdom of David set upon for her <a id="l4667"></a>to enter &amp; by the promise to make the persecuting synagogue of <a id="l4668"></a>Satan come and worship before her feet: &amp; in the seventh Church <a id="l4669"></a>by the victory of the armies in heaven against the armies of the Beast and <a id="l4670"></a>Kings of the earth.  This victory being the great mystery of God mainly <a id="l4671"></a>spoken of by the old Prophets &amp; being also the common period of the <a id="l4672"></a>seven Churches: for continuing the synchronism of those Churches, &amp; giving <a id="l4673"></a>light to the old Prophets, it will not be amiss now to explain it more fully.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p127r"> &lt;127r&gt; </span> 
<p id="par177">Now this war between the word of God &amp; the Beast will be best un<a id="l4674"></a>derstood by comparing it with the war between Michael &amp; the Dragon.  For Michael or Christ is this word of God, there Michael was represented <a id="l4675"></a>by a Man-child who was to rule all Nations with a rod of iron &amp; here <a id="l4676"></a>being grown to maturity he comes to smite them with a sharp word <a id="l4677"></a>&amp; rule them with a rod of iron Apoc. 19.15.  But as by the Dragon &amp; his <a id="l4678"></a>armies &amp; by the Beast &amp; by his armies we do not understand a single <a id="l4679"></a>person &amp; his armies but a kingdom &amp; its armies: So we shewed that the <a id="l4680"></a>Man-child or Michael &amp; his armies not Christ in heaven but his <a id="l4681"></a>mystical body, a Christian kingdom &amp; its armies is to be understood, <a id="l4682"></a>&amp; therefore by the word of God &amp; his armies a Christian kingdom with <a id="l4683"></a>its armies is also to be understood.  This kingdom to express the great<a id="l4684"></a>ness of its dominion &amp; its rise from the universal preaching of the <a id="l4685"></a>word of God by the two Prophets is rather called King of Kings &amp; the word of God rather then by any other name of Christ.</p>
<p id="par178">Against this King &amp; his army come the Beast &amp;  the Kings of the <a id="l4686"></a>Earth &amp; their armies.  The Beast &amp; the Kings of the earth are not the <a id="l4687"></a>Beast &amp; his horns but the Beast &amp; the Dragon.  For the horns of the <a id="l4688"></a>Beast go along with him into the lake of fire while the remnant <a id="l4689"></a>called Kings &amp; captains &amp; mighty Men &amp; horses &amp; them that sit on them <a id="l4690"></a>&amp; all men both free &amp; bond small &amp; great, that is the flesh of the Kings <a id="l4691"></a>of the earth &amp; their people are slain &amp; their flesh given to the <a id="l4692"></a>fowls of heaven.  The horns of a Beast always signify the kingdoms <a id="l4693"></a>of which the Beast is composed.  They gave their kingdom to the Beast <a id="l4694"></a>&amp;  by that gift the kingdome was his kingdome, every <a id="l4695"></a>one gave his kingdom to be one of his members.  The ten horns are <a id="l4696"></a>ten kings which make war with the Lamb, but these are kings of the <a id="l4697"></a>waters comprehended in the name of the Beast; &amp; in that respect <a id="l4698"></a>differ from the Kings of the earth.  The three frogs went forth <a id="l4699"></a> of the mouth of the Dragon Beast &amp; fals Prophet to the Kings <a id="l4700"></a>of the earth &amp; of the whole world to gather them to this Battle, <a id="l4701"></a>&amp; therefore the Dragon is engaged in the war together with the <a id="l4702"></a>Beast &amp; fals Prophet, &amp; by consequence comprehended in the <a id="l4703"></a>kings of the earth.  The earth whereof these are kings is here <a id="l4704"></a>taken but for a part of the whole world: &amp; what the other part <a id="l4705"></a>is you may know by the next words: And ever Island fled away <a id="l4706"></a>&amp; the mountains were not found.  The mountains are of the earth, <a id="l4707"></a>&amp; the Islands of the sea, &amp; therefore in the time of this battel <a id="l4708"></a>the two parts of the world are the earth &amp; sea or Dragon &amp;  Beast, <a id="l4709"></a>The kings of the earth are to be referred to the Dragon.  These <a id="l4710"></a>are the Kings of the east whose way at the pouring out of the sixt <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p128r"> &lt;128r&gt; </span>  Vial was prepared against the battel of the great day of God Al<a id="l4711"></a>mighty.  For those kings are the kings of the Euphratean horsmen <a id="l4712"></a>by whose serpentine tails you may known them to be of the Dragons <a id="l4713"></a>family.  By killing the third part of Men politically, that is <a id="l4714"></a>by conquering the men of the Dragons kindome, they became <a id="l4715"></a>Kings of the earth.  And therefore in the army of Kings &amp; Cap<a id="l4716"></a>tains &amp; mighty men to whose flesh all the fowls of heaven <a id="l4717"></a>are invited, you have horses &amp; them that sit on them, that is the <a id="l4718"></a>Euphratean horsmen: and when these are slain the Dragon <a id="l4719"></a>that old Serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan (that is not the Men <a id="l4720"></a>of his kingdome but his fals religion) is cast into that same <a id="l4721"></a>bottomless pitt, out of which the Locusts (the predecessors of the <a id="l4722"></a>Euphratean horsmen) arose before.  This pit was then unlocked <a id="l4723"></a>&amp; opened to let out the seduction of the Locusts &amp; after the Devil <a id="l4724"></a>&amp; opened to let out the seduction of the Locusts &amp; after the Devil <a id="l4725"></a>of seduction was cast into it lockt up again for a thousand <a id="l4726"></a>years.  If that error which before arose out of it remained in the <a id="l4727"></a>world till the Dragon was shut up that he should deceive the <a id="l4728"></a>Nations no more, its ceasing must be signifyed by its shutting <a id="l4729"></a>up.</p>
<p id="par179">Now the armies of these Kings were gathered together into a place <a id="l4730"></a>called in the Hebrew tongue Ar-ma geddon.  By the language of the <a id="l4731"></a>people the country is designed.  In the prophesy of the fift Church where <a id="l4732"></a>the scene of the visions is at Ierusalem in the Temple, 'tis said that <a id="l4733"></a>the winepress was trodden without the City (that is without) Ierusalem <a id="l4734"></a>the phrase alluding to the wine &amp; oyle presses, which were without <a id="l4735"></a>Ierusalem at the foot of mount Olivel, &amp; blood came out of the <a id="l4736"></a>winepress even unto the hors bridles by the space of 1600 furlongs, <a id="l4737"></a>that is unto the hors bridles of the armies of the word of God, who <a id="l4738"></a>treadeth the winepress of the fierceness &amp; wrath of Almighty God <a id="l4739"></a>Apoc. 19.15, by the space of the region of Iudea.  For of that length <a id="l4740"></a>do <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n65-ref">[65]</sup> Ierome &amp; <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n66-ref">[66]</sup> R. Menachem on Gen. fol. 60 reccon the land of Israel.  <a id="l4741"></a>Whence also the <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n67-ref">[67]</sup> Ierusalem Talmud in describing the great slaughter <a id="l4742"></a>of the Iews made by Hadrian at the destruction of the city saith <a id="l4743"></a><em class="underline">that the horses waded in blood up to the nostrils by the space of a <a id="l4744"></a>thousand &amp; six hundred furlongs</em>.  But whether Iudea be here <a id="l4745"></a>meant literally or as a type of the region of the whole Church <a id="l4746"></a>I leave to be considered.  Perhaps the persecution of the whole Church <a id="l4747"></a>may end with a war upon the converted Iews.</p>
<p id="par180">The armies &amp; the seat of the war being described, there remains the manner <a id="l4748"></a> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p129r"> &lt;129r&gt; </span>  of it to be understood.  The word of God being put for a Christian <a id="l4749"></a>Kingdom, the sharpe sword which comes out of his mouth must signify the <a id="l4750"></a>power of this kingdome.  It comes out of the mouth of the word of God <a id="l4751"></a>to express the rise &amp; growth thereof from preaching.    As upon <a id="l4755"></a>the first fall of Babylon the Gospel began to be generally preached, <a id="l4756"></a>&amp; upon the second fall to be more preached, so upon the more signal <a id="l4757"></a>judgment of destroying the Beast &amp; Fals Prophet the preaching <a id="l4758"></a>&amp; converting of the remnant of the Nations must be much quickened.  <a id="l4759"></a>For the removal of the Beast &amp; Fals prophet (the great enemies <a id="l4760"></a>of the Gospel) will give a much greater liberty to its preaching <a id="l4761"></a>then before, &amp; the judgment will startle &amp; incline men much <a id="l4762"></a>more to hearken to it. And when the truth is grown strong enough <a id="l4763"></a>the kingdoms or Cities of the Nations must fall of course, as is <a id="l4764"></a>exprest at the pouring out the last Vial.  And this is their being slain <a id="l4765"></a>with the two edged sword.  For slaying is every where in this pro<a id="l4766"></a>phesy used in a litteral sense for killing single persons <a id="l4767"></a>but mystically for dissolving bodies politic.  Then are all the fowls <a id="l4768"></a>of the air filled with their flesh, that is the armies of heaven be<a id="l4769"></a>come possessed of their wealth &amp; dominions, &amp; the Dragon that <a id="l4770"></a>old serpent called the Devil &amp; Satan is bound &amp; cast into the <a id="l4771"></a>bottomless pitt that he should deceive the Nations no more.  A <a id="l4772"></a>violent conquest without the preaching of the Gospel would not <a id="l4773"></a>put an end to error.  The conquering sword, to have this ef<a id="l4774"></a>fect on the Nation, must come out of the mouth of the word of <a id="l4775"></a>God.  </p>
<p id="par181">The Apostle Paul tells us that the Iewish sabbaths &amp; Feasts were <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p130r"> &lt;130r&gt; </span>  types of things to come. The Passover was a type of the first coming <a id="l4783"></a>of Christ. Is not the Feast of the seventh month a type of his second <a id="l4784"></a>coming? For the first day of the month called the Feast of Trumpets, <a id="l4785"></a>wherein Trumpets sounded all over the land, answers well to the <a id="l4786"></a>first yeare of the great tribulation, wherein the war between the <a id="l4787"></a>word of God &amp; the Beast &amp; Dragon begins; &amp; that tribulation lasting <a id="l4788"></a>ten prophetick days, which are years, may end with the fast on the <a id="l4789"></a>tenth day. For that Fast expresses well the great affliction &amp; distress <a id="l4790"></a>of Gods people in the end of the persecution immediately before <a id="l4791"></a>the Beast &amp; Fals Prophet be destroyed. And on this day began <a id="l4792"></a>the Iubile or year of release, the Trumpets sounding all over the <a id="l4793"></a>Land Levit. 25.19. Then follows four or five days until the Feast <a id="l4794"></a>of Tabernacles, which may be a time of preaching the Gospel until <a id="l4795"></a>the kingdom of the Nations begin to fall. Then the Feast lasts seven <a id="l4796"></a>days, &amp; is a very lively Emblem of war, victory &amp; triumph. For <a id="l4797"></a>the dwelling in Tabernacles expresses the encamping of armies <a id="l4798"></a>abroad. The great sacrifices of all  seven days, &amp; the great <a id="l4799"></a>sounding of Trumpets at them express great wars, &amp; so answer to <a id="l4800"></a>the killing of Men with the two edged sword called by Ezekiel a great <a id="l4801"></a>sacrifice on the Mountains of Israel Ezek. 39.17. For these sacrifices <a id="l4802"></a>the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n68-ref">[68]</sup> Iews accounted offered for the Nations. At the division of the earth there <a id="l4803"></a>were accounted seventy Nations &amp; in all the seven days seventy bullocks <a id="l4804"></a>were offered, &amp; the Iews accounted one bullock offered for every Nation <a id="l4805"></a>They were burn sacrifices offered by fire &amp; so denote a sacrifice of <a id="l4806"></a>the Nations by war. Further the feasting of Israel on those seven days <a id="l4807"></a>answers to the supper of the great God to which the fowls of the heaven are <a id="l4808"></a>invited that they may eat the flesh of the slain. The crying Hosanna <a id="l4809"></a>with palm branches every day is a type of victory &amp; triumph. The <a id="l4810"></a>pouring out of water upon the Altar all the seven days expresses <a id="l4811"></a>the pouring out of Gods spirit upon all flesh until all seduction and <a id="l4812"></a>error be cast into the bottomless pitt.  The great rejoycing in the <a id="l4813"></a>Temple with musick &amp; singing &amp; dancing in so excessive a measure <a id="l4814"></a>as to occasion the proverb among the Iews, that he who has not seen <a id="l4815"></a>the rejoycing at drawing of water had not seen any rejoycing at all, is a  full expression of such joy as may be conceived at the conquest of the <a id="l4816"></a>Nations. And the great Hosanna of the last day may express the completion of  their victories. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p131r"> &lt;131r&gt; </span>   Considering therefore that the circumstances of the feast are so well fitted <a id="l4817"></a>to represent the war of the great day,  &amp; that the Apocalyps which is a pro<a id="l4818"></a>phesy of Christs second coming alludes to almost nothing else in the law <a id="l4819"></a>but this Feast, it inclines me much to suspect that there is some such <a id="l4820"></a>mystery in it as I have explained. The truth I must leave to be discovered by time.</p>
<p id="par182">In the next place the Apostle saw thrones, the soules of the Martyrs and <a id="l4821"></a>those who had not worshipped the Beast &amp; his Image nor received G<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ods<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l4822"></a>mark, &amp; they lived &amp; reigned with Christ a thousand years, &amp; then <a id="l4823"></a>Satan is losed &amp; deceives the Nations Gog &amp; Magog &amp; they compass the <a id="l4824"></a>beloved city &amp; are consumed by fire from heaven &amp; the Devil is cast <a id="l4825"></a>into the lake of fire where the Beast &amp; Fals Prophet are &amp; shall be <a id="l4826"></a>tormented day &amp; night for ever &amp; ever. Concerning all which I ob<a id="l4827"></a>serve, first that since the Dragon is cast into the lake of fire where <a id="l4828"></a>the Beast &amp; fals Prophet were before, therefore the war of God <a id="l4829"></a>&amp; Magog is not that war wherein the Beast &amp; fals Prophet were <a id="l4830"></a>cast into the Lake, but another which comes after it by the space of a <a id="l4831"></a>thousand years. Error reigned in the Dragon till he gave the Beast <a id="l4832"></a>his throne, &amp; then in the Dragon Beast &amp; fals Prophet till the two last <a id="l4833"></a>were cast into the lake of fire, &amp; therefore the ceasing of all error <a id="l4834"></a>for a thousand years signifyed by the shutting up of the Dragon must <a id="l4835"></a>come afterwards. Secondly I observe that the Lake of fire into which the Beast &amp; fals Prophet are cast is really hell,  and that partly <a id="l4836"></a>because the Devil is cast into the same lake of fire where they were <a id="l4837"></a>before, &amp; all three are therein tormented together for ever &amp; ever, <a id="l4838"></a>&amp; partly because in the general judgment described in the next words, <a id="l4839"></a>all the dead as many as are not found written in the book of life <a id="l4840"></a>are cast into the same Lake, &amp; their punishment therein is called <a id="l4841"></a>the second death, a phrase used by the Iews to signify Hell torments, &amp; certainly used in this sense in other places of the Apocalyps ch 28.8 &amp; 2.11. <a id="l4842"></a>A little before the Beast and fals Prophet are cast into the Lake of <a id="l4843"></a>fire, they are thus threatned. <em class="underline">If any man worship the Beast &amp; his <a id="l4844"></a>Image &amp; receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, the same <a id="l4845"></a>shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without <a id="l4846"></a>mixture into the cup of his indignation &amp; he shall be tormented <a id="l4847"></a>with fire &amp; brimstone in the presence of the Lamb, &amp; the smoke of <a id="l4848"></a>their torment ascendeth up for ever &amp; ever, &amp; they have no <a id="l4849"></a>rest day nor might who worship the Beast &amp; his Image, &amp; whosoever <a id="l4850"></a>receiveth the mark of his Name</em>. That Hell is here threatned is <a id="l4851"></a>indisputably evident, &amp; the subsequent casting out of the Beast &amp; fals Prophet <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p132r"> &lt;132r&gt; </span> into the Lake of fire burning with brimstone is the putting this threat in <a id="l4852"></a>execution. Thirdly I observe that the resurrection of the dead &amp; day of judg<a id="l4853"></a>ment begin with the casting of the Beast &amp; fals Prophet into the Lake of <a id="l4854"></a>fire, &amp; that for these reasons. First because their enduring the pains of <a id="l4855"></a>hell presupposes the immortality of their bodys &amp; by consequence either <a id="l4856"></a>their resurrection or (which is all one) the change of their bodies. Th<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>is is<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l4857"></a>because their punishment presupposes their being judged: for no <a id="l4858"></a>man is justly executed before sentence pass. Next because the <a id="l4859"></a>harvest &amp; vintage is synchronal to the time &amp; is a known type <a id="l4860"></a>of the day of judgment Matt. 13, Ioel 3.12. Also at the Trumpet <a id="l4861"></a>(which sounds to this war of the Beast &amp; Fals Prophet with the Lamb) <a id="l4862"></a>it is said that the time of the dead is come that they should be judged <a id="l4863"></a>&amp; that God should give reward to his servants the Prophets, &amp; to the <a id="l4864"></a>Saints &amp; then that fear his name both small &amp; great. And <a id="l4865"></a>here after the resurrection &amp; judgment is exprest by dooming <a id="l4866"></a>the Beast &amp; Fals Prophets to the Lake of fire, tis exprest also <a id="l4867"></a>by the reward &amp; judgment of the Saints. <em class="underline">And I saw thrones</em> saith <a id="l4868"></a>he, <em class="underline">&amp; they sat upon them &amp; judgment was given them, &amp; I saw <a id="l4869"></a>the soules of them that were beheaded for the witness of Iesus and <a id="l4870"></a>for the word of God &amp; which had not worshipped the Beast nor his <a id="l4871"></a>Image &amp;c, &amp; they lived</em> [that is rose again from the dead] <em class="underline">&amp; reigned <a id="l4872"></a>with Christ a thousand years: but the rest of the dead lived not again <a id="l4873"></a>till the thousand years were finished</em>. In what sence the rest of the <a id="l4874"></a>dead were dead &amp; lived again after the thousand years were finished, <a id="l4875"></a>in the same sence these were also dead, &amp; at this time lived again. <a id="l4876"></a>For these &amp; the rest of the dead are here spoken of as two parts <a id="l4877"></a>of the same whole both which rise again but not at the same time.</p>
<p id="par183">Now the rest of the dead are acknowledged to rise again really &amp; <a id="l4878"></a>truly in the last judgment thus described in the next place. <em class="underline">And I saw</em> <a id="l4879"></a>saith the Prophet, <em class="underline">a great white throne &amp; him that sat on it from <a id="l4880"></a>whose face the earth &amp; the heaven fled away, &amp; there was found <a id="l4881"></a>no place for them. And I saw the dead small &amp; great stand before <a id="l4882"></a>God &amp; the books were opened, &amp; another book was opened which is the book <a id="l4883"></a>of life &amp; the dead were judged out of those things which were written <a id="l4884"></a>in the books according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead <a id="l4885"></a>which were in it &amp; death &amp; the grave delivered up the dead which were in <a id="l4886"></a>them, &amp; they were judged every man according to their works. And</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p133r"> &lt;133r&gt; </span>  <em class="underline">death &amp; the grave were cast into the Lake of fire</em>. This is so full &amp; express a description of the last judg<a id="l4887"></a>ment as nothing can be more. But whilst interpreters date this <a id="l4888"></a>from the end of the thousand years &amp; make it respect only the second <a id="l4889"></a>resurrection. I find it begins with the battel of the great day when <a id="l4890"></a>the Beast &amp; Fals Prophet are cast into the Lake of fire &amp; so compre<a id="l4891"></a>hends both resurrections. For it is the very same judgment with that described by Daniel in these words: <em class="underline">I beheld the thrones</em> [of the Kingdoms <a id="l4892"></a>of this world] <em class="underline">were cast down &amp; the ancient of days did sit, whose <a id="l4893"></a>garment was white as snow &amp; the hair of his head like pure wool &amp; <a id="l4894"></a>his throne was like the fiery flame, &amp; his wheels</em> [those wheels of <a id="l4895"></a>his throne described by Ezekiel] <em class="underline">as burning fire. A fiery streame <a id="l4896"></a>came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministred unto <a id="l4897"></a>him &amp; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the  <a id="l4898"></a>judgment was sett &amp; the books were opened. I beheld them because <a id="l4899"></a>of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke. I beheld till the <a id="l4900"></a>Beast was slain &amp; his body given to the burning flame</em>.</p>
<p id="par184">The general judgment  is both of the living &amp; the dead, &amp; begins <a id="l4901"></a>with Christs appearing &amp; his kingdom 2 Tim. 4.1, 1 Pet. 4.5. The first act <a id="l4902"></a>of this coming &amp; judgment is to destroy the Man of sin which is a judgment <a id="l4903"></a>of the living &amp; this is done by these steps. First the whore is burnt with <a id="l4904"></a>fire &amp;  then the Beast &amp; fals Prophet cast into the Lake of fire, &amp; the <a id="l4905"></a>rest slain with the two edged sword &amp; the Dragon shut up. For Daniel's <a id="l4906"></a>begins the great judgment with the end of the reign of the little horn. <a id="l4907"></a><em class="underline">I beheld</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">&amp; the same horn made war with the Saints &amp; pre<a id="l4908"></a>vailed against them untill the ancient of days came, &amp; judgment was <a id="l4909"></a>given to the saints of the most High, &amp; the time came that the Saints poss<a id="l4910"></a>essed the kingdom</em>. And so in the Apocalyps at the burning of the Whore <a id="l4911"></a>when the witnesses rose again &amp; the Gospel begins to be universally <a id="l4912"></a>preacht an Angel proclaiming: <em class="underline">Fear God for the hour of his judgment <a id="l4913"></a>is come</em> Apoc. 14, &amp; then at the fall of Babylon 'tis said, <em class="underline"> she shall be <a id="l4914"></a>utterly burnt with fire for strong is the Lord God that judgeth her</em> <a id="l4915"></a>ch. 18.8: &amp; again; <em class="underline">Alleluja, for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth</em> <a id="l4916"></a>ch. 19.6. This is the period of time which Christ speaks in saying, when <a id="l4917"></a>the Son of Man comes, shall he find faith on the earth? This is, as <a id="l4918"></a>I may say, the dawning of the day of judgment. Then arises &amp; breaks <a id="l4919"></a>forth the Son of righteousness in the clouds of heaven to the ancient of days <a id="l4920"></a>&amp; receiving dominion &amp; a kingdom, that all people Nations &amp; languages <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p134r"> &lt;134r&gt; </span> should serve him for ever &amp; ever, &amp; in Iohn by the word of God the King <a id="l4921"></a>of Kings &amp; Lord of Lords coming in the clouds with the armies in heaven <a id="l4922"></a>on white horses. For he comes now in a double power &amp; dominion; <a id="l4923"></a>in his mystical body of an army &amp; kingdom of Mortals led on &amp; <a id="l4924"></a>ruled by a mortal king his vicegerent on Earth, &amp; in his own person attended with an innumerable host of Angels who <em class="underline">gather out of <a id="l4925"></a>his kingdom all things that offend &amp; them which do iniquity</em> [the Beast &amp; <a id="l4926"></a>fals Prophet] <em class="underline">&amp; cast them into a furnace of fire; There shall be <a id="l4927"></a>wailing &amp; gnashing of teeth: &amp; then shall the righteous shine forth <a id="l4928"></a>as the Son in the kingdom of their Father</em> (Matt. 13.41) being ga<a id="l4929"></a>thered by the same Angels from the four winds, &amp; caught up in the <a id="l4930"></a>clouds to meet the Lord in the air &amp; reign with him in heaven Matt <a id="l4931"></a>24.31. 1 Thes. 4.16, 17. And now <em class="underline">thrones are set &amp; they sit upon them <a id="l4932"></a>&amp; judgment is given them</em> Apoc. 20: or as Daniel expresses it, <em class="underline">The <a id="l4933"></a>judgment was set &amp; the books were opened</em>. Now all this is thus <a id="l4934"></a>repeated in the general judgment of the Apocalyps.</p>
<p id="par185"><em class="underline">And I saw</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">a great white throne &amp; him that sat on it, <a id="l4935"></a>from whose face the earth &amp; the heaven fled away, &amp; there was found <a id="l4936"></a>no more place for them</em>. Heaven &amp; earth are here taken in such <a id="l4937"></a>a sence as they use to signify in prophesy &amp; as they are taken at <a id="l4938"></a>the opening of the sixt seale where the Sun Moon, &amp; stars are smitten, &amp; heaven departs as a scroll &amp; every mountain &amp; Island are moved <a id="l4939"></a>out of their places, that is for the politic world. This heaven and <a id="l4940"></a>earth departs away at the ruin of the Whore, Beast, fals Prophet &amp; <a id="l4941"></a>Kings of the earth, &amp; sending up of the Dragon: And then follow <a id="l4942"></a>the Vision of thrones &amp; them that sat on them &amp; the judgment given <a id="l4943"></a>unto them: &amp; the resurrection of those who reign with Christ. <em class="underline">And I <a id="l4944"></a>saw</em>; saith he, <em class="underline">the dead small &amp; great stand before God &amp; the books <a id="l4945"></a>were opened</em> &amp;c, &amp; from this judgment commences the reign of the <a id="l4946"></a>Saints with Christ or kingdom of heaven, <em class="underline">And I saw</em>, saith he, <a id="l4947"></a><em class="underline">a new heaven &amp; a new earth, for the first heaven &amp; the first earth <a id="l4948"></a>were passed away &amp; there was no more sea; &amp; I saw the holy <a id="l4949"></a>City the new Ierusalem, coming down from God out of heaven pre<a id="l4950"></a>pared as a bride adorned for her husband</em> The heaven wherein <a id="l4951"></a>the Dragon &amp; the woman were seen, &amp; the earth &amp; Sea to which he came <a id="l4952"></a>down are now passed away, &amp; in their place succeed the heaven &amp; <a id="l4953"></a>earth of a new kingdom, whose regal city is the new Ierusalem. <a id="l4954"></a>So then every part of the Apocalyps has its repetition &amp; interpre<a id="l4955"></a>tation. The prophesy of the Seals &amp; Trumpets is repeated in that of <a id="l4956"></a>the Dragon &amp; Beasts, &amp; the prophesy of the fall of Babylon &amp; the casting <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p135r"> &lt;135r&gt; </span> of the Beasts &amp; Fals Prophet into the Lake of fire, &amp; the throne &amp; judgment <a id="l4957"></a>&amp; reign of the Saints with Christ is repeated in that of the old heaven and <a id="l4958"></a>earth passing away, the great white throne &amp; general judgment &amp; the <a id="l4959"></a>new heaven &amp; new earth &amp; new Ierusalem.</p>
<p id="par186">But you will say how can the general judgment be in the beginning <a id="l4960"></a>of the thousand years, since it is said that the rest of the dead lived not <a id="l4961"></a>again till the thousand years were finished. Understand therefore that there is a first death &amp; a second death, a first resurrection &amp; a se<a id="l4962"></a>cond resurrection. The first resurrection is from the first death, the <a id="l4963"></a>second resurrection from the second death. The first death is of mortal <a id="l4964"></a>bodies cast into the grave, the second of immortal ones cast into the Lake <a id="l4965"></a>of fire; &amp; therefore as the first resurrection is from the grave, so the <a id="l4966"></a>second is from the Lake of fire. The first resurrection is in the <a id="l4967"></a>beginning of the thousand years, the second not before the end. From <a id="l4968"></a>the time of the first resurrection the Saints lived <em class="underline">&amp; reigned with Christ <a id="l4969"></a>a thousand years, but the rest of the dead</em> [rose not then to live but <a id="l4970"></a>died the second death &amp;] <em class="underline">lived not again till the thousand years were <a id="l4971"></a>finished. Blessed &amp; holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection <a id="l4972"></a>on such the second wrath</em> [burning the thousand years] <em class="underline">hath no power</em> <a id="l4973"></a>[as it hath on all the rest] <em class="underline">but they shall be Priests to God &amp; Christ <a id="l4974"></a>&amp; reign with him a thousand years</em>. He doth not say that at the end of <a id="l4975"></a>the thousand years all shall rise again; for the Beast &amp; fals Prophet remain <a id="l4976"></a>still in the Lake to be tormented with the Devil for ever &amp; ever. For there <a id="l4977"></a>are degrees of reward &amp; degrees of punishment. Some are great in the kingdom of heaven &amp; others are the least therein Matt. 5.19. It shall be <a id="l4978"></a>more tollerable for Tyre &amp; Sidon &amp; the day of judgment then for Cha<a id="l4979"></a>razin &amp; Bethsaida, for Sodom then for Capernaum Matt. 11.21, 23. Every <a id="l4980"></a>Man shall be rewarded according to his works. If any man build upon <a id="l4981"></a>the true foundation Gold, Silver, pretious stones, wood, hay, stubble, <a id="l4982"></a>the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is. If any mans work <a id="l4983"></a>abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward: if any man's <a id="l4984"></a>work be burnt, he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so <a id="l4985"></a>as by fire  1 Cor. 3.15. Is not this Christ's <a id="l4986"></a>baptizing Men with fire? Is it not the prison out of which the debter comes <a id="l4987"></a>not till he has paid the farthing? For so the ancient Christians under<a id="l4988"></a>stood it as Clemens Alexandrinus Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian, Cæsarius, also Gregory Nyssen, <a id="l4989"></a>Ierom, Ambrose, Austin, &amp; from this tradition corrupted might spring <a id="l4990"></a>the Purgatory of the Church of Rome.<sup class="note" id="n69-ref">[69]</sup> The souls of Men are often <a id="l4991"></a>put for men living in the body (as here where the Souls of Men lived <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p136r-b"> &lt;136r&gt; </span> &amp; reigned with Christ) which language being understood by few the erring multi<a id="l4992"></a>tude made a purgatory of the Souls of Men before the resurrection. We are <a id="l4993"></a>buried with Christ in Baptism, &amp; therefore the baptism with water is a type <a id="l4994"></a>of the first death &amp; first resurrection: why may it not be so of the second <a id="l4995"></a>also? and why may not Iohn the Baptist indicate as much in saying, I bap<a id="l4996"></a>tize you with the Holy Ghost &amp; with fire? If it may be so, then the argument against <a id="l4997"></a>the general judgment's beginning with the thousand years ceases, &amp; if the <a id="l4998"></a>general judgment begins with the thousand years it must be also.</p>
<p id="par195">Now that it begins with the thousand years is further confirmed by <a id="l4999"></a>the following considerations. In its beginning the old heaven &amp; earth <a id="l5000"></a>flee away from the face of him that sits upon the throne, &amp; then appear <a id="l5001"></a>new heaven &amp; new earth &amp; a new Ierusalem: &amp; he that sat upon <a id="l5002"></a>the throne said Behold I make all things new. These new things appear <a id="l5003"></a>after the first heaven &amp; earth are fled away Apoc. 21.1, &amp; after God be<a id="l5004"></a>gins to sit upon the great white throne &amp; therefore they begin not before <a id="l5005"></a>the general judgment. But they begin with the thousand years, for these <a id="l5006"></a>reasons. First it is said before the battel of the word of God &amp; the Beast, <a id="l5007"></a>that the Lord God omnipotent reigneth, &amp; the marriage of the Lamb is <a id="l5008"></a>come &amp; his wife hath made her self ready Apoc. 19.6, 7, &amp; in answer <a id="l5009"></a>to this God is represented in the beginning of the general judgment <a id="l5010"></a>sitting upon a great white throne that is reigning in his new kingdom, <a id="l5011"></a>&amp; the new Ierusalem then coming down from God out of heaven is <a id="l5012"></a>said to be prepared as a bride adorned for her husband Apoc. 21.2. <a id="l5013"></a>The marriage of the Lamb therefore did not precede the descent <a id="l5014"></a>of the new Ierusalem, &amp; yet it was at the beginning of the thousand <a id="l5015"></a>years, because it was come, &amp; his wife had made her self ready when <a id="l5016"></a>those years were commencing. Secondly at the descent of the new <a id="l5017"></a>Ierusalem there is a great voice from heaven saying, <em class="underline">the tabernacle <a id="l5018"></a>is with men &amp; he will dwell with them &amp; be their God, &amp; God shall <a id="l5019"></a>wipe away all tears from their eyes, &amp; there shall be no more <a id="l5020"></a>death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away</em>. It descends therefore <a id="l5021"></a>at the end of the troubles, afflictions &amp; persecutions of the Saints in <a id="l5022"></a>this world when God wipes away all tears from their eyes, &amp; begins <a id="l5023"></a>to dwell with Men, &amp; this is at the coming of the Palmbearing multitude <a id="l5024"></a>out of the great tribulation. For they from thence forward are before <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p137r"> &lt;137r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">the throne of God &amp; serve him day &amp; night in his Temple, &amp; he that <a id="l5025"></a>sitteth on the throne dwelleth</em> [or hath his Tabernacle] <em class="underline">amongst <a id="l5026"></a>them &amp; they hunger no more neither thurst any more, &amp; God wipes <a id="l5027"></a>away all tears from their eyes Apoc</em>. 7.15. At the sounding of the seventh <a id="l5028"></a>Trumpet when the Kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of <a id="l5029"></a>God &amp; of his Christ, &amp; he begins to reign for ever &amp; ever, then does <a id="l5030"></a>he that sits upon the great white throne place his Tabernacle among <a id="l5031"></a>men &amp; begin to dwell with them &amp; to be their God, &amp; to wipe all <a id="l5032"></a>tears from their eyes. Then are the former things [the first heaven <a id="l5033"></a>&amp; the first earth] passed away, &amp; God makes all things new. Thirdly <a id="l5034"></a>the words, <em class="underline">It is done</em>, coming after the words <em class="underline">the former things <a id="l5035"></a>are passed away &amp; behold I make all things new</em>, are of the same <a id="l5036"></a>signification with the  same words <em class="underline">It is done</em> spoken at the <a id="l5037"></a>pouring out of the seventh Vial &amp; relate to them. This is the great <a id="l5038"></a>mystery of God to be finished at the sounding of the Seventh Trumpet, <a id="l5039"></a>&amp; therefore the new heaven &amp; new earth are then created.

If you ask where this heavenly city is, I an<a id="l5101"></a>swer, I do not know. It becomes not a blind Man to talk of <a id="l5102"></a>colours.

We usually conceive it to be above. When <a id="l5114"></a>Paul &amp; Stephen saw him in the clouds he was in heaven. Whether <a id="l5115"></a>he ascended after his resurrection where he is now with the Angels, <a id="l5116"></a>&amp; from whence he shall together with them descend to judgment, <a id="l5117"></a>there may the saints after the resurrection &amp; judgment reign with <a id="l5118"></a>him, &amp; at the same time invisibly exercise dominion over Mortals <a id="l5119"></a>on earth.

He that shall well consider the strange <a id="l5135"></a>&amp; wonderful nature of life &amp; the frame of Animals will think <a id="l5136"></a>nothing beyond the possibility of Nature, nothing too hard for the <a id="l5137"></a>omnipotent power of God. And as the Planets remain in their orbs, <a id="l5138"></a>so may any other bodies subsist at any distance from the earth, <a id="l5139"></a>&amp; much more may beings who have a sufficient power of self <a id="l5140"></a>motion, move whether they will place themselves where they <a id="l5141"></a>will, &amp; continue in any regions of the heavens whatever, there <a id="l5142"></a>to enjoy the society of one another &amp; by their <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>own sences<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> or <a id="l5143"></a>Angels to rule the earth &amp; convers with the remotest regions.

And to have thus the liberty &amp; dominion of <a id="l5147"></a>the whole heavens &amp; the choise of the happiest places for abode <a id="l5148"></a>seems a greater happiness then to be confined to any one place <a id="l5149"></a>whatever. But the truth &amp; manner of these things we shall <a id="l5150"></a>not understand before the resurrection. I only speak of the possibility.</p>
<p id="par197">And thô 'tis become the common opinion that the globe of the earth shal <a id="l5151"></a>at the day of judgment be burnt up &amp; have an end, yet upon considering <a id="l5152"></a>the matter I cannot find any sufficient ground for the concept. The original <a id="l5153"></a>of it seems to be thus, that they to whom the day of judgment was first revealed <a id="l5154"></a>deciphered it to the common people in the prophetick language, representing <a id="l5155"></a>the world politic of the nations by the world natural of the heaven &amp; earth <a id="l5156"></a>&amp; that the common people &amp; some of the heathen Philosophers who under<a id="l5157"></a>stood not the prophetick language took it in the litteral sence. The tra<a id="l5158"></a>dition is that as the world once perished by water so it should perish again <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p141r"> &lt;141r&gt; </span> &amp; that by fire. So some of the heathen Philosophers &amp; so also the Author of <a id="l5159"></a>the second epistle commonly ascribed to Peter. Now the world which perished <a id="l5160"></a>by water was the world politique, &amp; therefore 'tis the world politique which perish<a id="l5161"></a>eth by fire, &amp; as the Natural heaven &amp; earth remained after the first <a id="l5162"></a>perishing, so it may remain after the second. When the Whore is burnt <a id="l5163"></a>with fire, &amp; the Beast &amp; fals Prophet together with all the world, whose <a id="l5164"></a>Names are not written in the book of life, are cast into the lake of fire, <a id="l5165"></a>&amp; the heaven &amp; earth fly away from the face of him that sits upon the <a id="l5166"></a>throne, &amp; God creates all things new; then doth this present world <a id="l5167"></a>perish by fire &amp; the heavens pass away with a great noise, &amp; the elements <a id="l5168"></a>(the Gold, Silver, pretious stones, wood, hay, stubble, as Paul expresseth <a id="l5169"></a>it) melt with fervent heat, &amp; then the Saints according to Gods promise <a id="l5170"></a>look for new heavens &amp; a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. <a id="l5171"></a>For as Noah was saved out of the waters, so in the judgment by fire <a id="l5172"></a>a remnant may be preserved to replenish the earth a second time.</p>

<p id="par199">And that you may be assured that this is the meaning of this Epistle or <a id="l5175"></a>else that Peter was not the Author of it, hear what Peter himself saith. <a id="l5176"></a><em class="underline">Ye denyed the holy one</em>, saith he to the Iews, <em class="underline">&amp; killed the Prince of life, <a id="l5177"></a>Repent ye therefore &amp; be converted  that your sins</em> [that is <a id="l5178"></a>the sins of your Nation in crucifying Iesus] <em class="underline">may be blotted out, when <a id="l5179"></a>the times of refreshing shall come from the Lord, &amp; he shall send <a id="l5180"></a>Iesus Christ which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven <a id="l5181"></a>must receive untill the times of restitution of all things which God <a id="l5182"></a>hath spoken of by the mouth of all his holy Prophets since the <a id="l5183"></a>world began</em>. – Peter here describes at the coming of Christ to judg<a id="l5184"></a>ment, not the conflagration &amp; final destruction of the world, but <a id="l5185"></a>on the contrary the refreshing &amp; restitution of all things.</p>
<p id="par200">Now the truth of this &amp; of all the foregoing interpretations will <a id="l5186"></a>more fully appear by comparing the Apocalyps with the prophesies of <a id="l5187"></a>the old Testament to which it alludes. For since the mystery of God, <a id="l5188"></a>which is to be finished in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel <a id="l5189"></a>when he shall begin to sound, hath been declared by him to his <a id="l5190"></a>servants the Prophets (Apoc. 10.7) there is no question but we may <a id="l5191"></a>find it in them, &amp; that very copiously, it being spoken of, as Peter saith, <a id="l5192"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>by<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the mouth of all the Prophets since the world began.</p>

Afterwards shal <a id="l5266"></a>the children of Israel return &amp;  seek the Lord their God, &amp; David their <a id="l5267"></a>King, &amp; the fear of the Lord, &amp; his goodness in the latter days</em> Hosea 3.4. <a id="l5268"></a>And how this kingdom shal flourish in righteousness &amp; last for ever is <a id="l5269"></a>thus described by Ezekiel: <em class="underline">Son of Man, take thee one stick, &amp; writ upon <a id="l5270"></a>it, for Iudah, &amp; for the children of Israel his companions; then take another <a id="l5271"></a>stick, &amp; writ upon it for Ioseph the stick of Ephraim, &amp; for all the house <a id="l5272"></a>of Israel his companions. And joyn them one to another into one stick <a id="l5273"></a>&amp; they shal become one in thy hand. – And be in thy hand before the eyes <a id="l5274"></a>of the children of thy people. And say unto them, thus saith the Lord God, <a id="l5275"></a>behold I wil take the children of Israel from among the heathen whether <a id="l5276"></a>they be gone, I will gather them on every side, &amp; bring them into their <a id="l5277"></a>own land. And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains <a id="l5278"></a>of Israel, &amp; one King shal be King to them all, &amp; they shal be no more <a id="l5279"></a>two nations, neither shal they be divided into two kingdoms any more at <a id="l5280"></a>all. Neither shal they defile themselves any more with their Idols, nor with <a id="l5281"></a>their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions, but I wil <a id="l5282"></a>save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have sinned <a id="l5283"></a>&amp; wil cleanse them: so shal they be my people and I will be their God. <a id="l5284"></a>And David my servant shal be king over them, &amp; they all shal have <a id="l5285"></a>one shepherd: they shal also walk in my judgments &amp; observe my sta<a id="l5286"></a>tutes, &amp; do them. And they shal dwel in the land that I have given unto <a id="l5287"></a>Iacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt, &amp; they shall <a id="l5288"></a>dwell therein, even they, &amp; their children, &amp; their childrens children <a id="l5289"></a>for ever, &amp; my servant David shal be their Prince for ever. Moreover <a id="l5290"></a>I will make a covenant of peace with them: I wil place them, &amp; multiply them, &amp; wil set <a id="l5291"></a>my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.

This righteous and <a id="l5295"></a>everlasting kingdom of David will easily I think be allowed to be the Kingdom <a id="l5296"></a>of the Messiah, &amp; consequently to be Christian, &amp; therefore since it is of the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p145r"> &lt;145r&gt; </span> two tribes &amp; ten tribes returning from a long captivity into the land <a id="l5297"></a>of Israel which God gave to Iacob, even into that same promised land <a id="l5298"></a>wherein their Fathers dwell, &amp; therein becoming reunited under one <a id="l5299"></a>King &amp; reigning for ever without apostatizing any more from God: <a id="l5300"></a>it can be no other kingdom then that of God &amp; Christ which commences <a id="l5301"></a>at the sounding of the seventh Trumpet, &amp; is founded by the conversion <a id="l5302"></a>of the Iews &amp; their return from captivity as almost all the prophets <a id="l5303"></a>describe.

This prophesy I have recited the more <a id="l5374"></a>fully because 'tis pointed at in the Apocalyps by divers allusions (as you <a id="l5375"></a>may see noted in Margine) &amp; contains a fully &amp; distincter des<a id="l5376"></a>cription of the battel of the great day of God Almighty then is <a id="l5377"></a>any where else in scripture to be met with. For by all those al<a id="l5378"></a>lusions it is determined to be the battel of the great day to which <a id="l5379"></a>the seventh Trumpet sounds; &amp; more especially by this circum<a id="l5380"></a>stance that it presently follows the return of the Iews from their cap<a id="l5381"></a>tivity, &amp; lays the foundation of their dominion over the Nations. <a id="l5382"></a>Afterwards at the end of a thousand years follows such another <a id="l5383"></a>war of the Nations against the holy city, whence those Nations <a id="l5384"></a>to denote the resemblance which that war hath to this are also <a id="l5385"></a>God &amp; Magog.</p>
<p id="par203">Now since Ezekiel tells us that the war of Gog described <a id="l5386"></a>by him was prophesied of by the former Prophets of Israel, <a id="l5387"></a>we may expect it in the other Prophets, &amp; if we look into <a id="l5388"></a>the prophesy of Ioel we shal find a very lively description <a id="l5389"></a>of it there.

And it is very observable <a id="l5465"></a>that the mystery of the harvest &amp; vintage described in the Apocalyps is <a id="l5466"></a>here applied to the slaughters made in the war, the people of God <a id="l5467"></a>falling in the harvest by the hand of the Nations invading them &amp; the <a id="l5468"></a>chapters of the wicked invaders by being gathered &amp; squeezed in the <a id="l5469"></a>vintage. For the allusion of the Apocalyptic harvest &amp; vintage to this <a id="l5470"></a>of Ioel is so evident that by this circumstance alone we might be assured that Ioel here speaks of the people prophesied of in the <a id="l5471"></a>Apocalyps. But how the harvest precedes the vintage is more <a id="l5472"></a>distinctly described by Isaiah in his prophesies annexed to those of <a id="l5473"></a>Zechary chap. 14. <em class="underline">Behold</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">the day of the Lord cometh, &amp; the spoile <a id="l5474"></a>shall  be divided in the midst of thee <a id="l5476"></a>For I will gather all nations against Ierusalem to battel, &amp; the <a id="l5477"></a>city shal be taken</em> [&amp; the abomination of desolation stand where <a id="l5478"></a>it ought not, Matt. 24] <em class="underline"> &amp; the houses rifled, &amp; the weomen ravished, <a id="l5479"></a>&amp; half of the city shal go forth into captivity, &amp; the residue of the <a id="l5480"></a>people shall not be cut off from the city.

Thus far Isaiah. Now the enjoyning the <a id="l5493"></a>feasts of Tabernacles &amp; by consequence the Fast also) to be from <a id="l5494"></a>thence forwards kept by the conquered nations, is plainly in memory of <a id="l5495"></a>the victory &amp; foundation of the new kingdom, &amp; therefore confirms what <a id="l5496"></a>I said of that Fast &amp; Feast's being a type of the conquest of the Nations <a id="l5497"></a>at Christs second coming. Tis the way of all kingdoms to keep anni<a id="l5498"></a>versary solemnities of signal blessings &amp; great deliverances. The <a id="l5499"></a>Iews kept the Passover partly in memory of their coming out of Egypt, <a id="l5500"></a>partly as an anniversary type of the passions of the Messiah to come: &amp; <a id="l5501"></a>we now keep it in memory of his Passion past. And so the feast of <a id="l5502"></a>the seventh month kept by the Iews as a type of Christs second coming <a id="l5503"></a>of  the kingdom of God then to be founded may be hereafter kept <a id="l5504"></a>in memory of that coming &amp; as the anniversary or birth-day of the <a id="l5505"></a>kingdom of God which from thence forward shal stand for ever. But <a id="l5506"></a>after what manner it shal be kept belongs not to us to enquire. At <a id="l5507"></a>that time God will pour out his spirit upon all flesh (as Ioel tells us) <a id="l5508"></a>&amp; what he shal appoint that shall be done.</p>
<p id="par204">Of the same kind with the prophesies of Ezekiel &amp; Ioel are the eight <a id="l5509"></a>last chapters of Isaiah.

For by comparing <a id="l5511"></a>them &amp; the Apocalyps together both will be illustrated.

For the meaning of these types is fully ex<a id="l5638"></a>plained. The type also of making the Nations drunk with the cup of the <a id="l5639"></a>wine of Gods wrath is here sufficiently declared to be of the same <a id="l5640"></a>signification with that of treading the winepress. But this type is  <a id="l5641"></a>more fully explained by Ieremiah chap. 25. For he there prophe<a id="l5642"></a>sies of the <em class="underline">cup of the wine of God's  fury</em> given first to the Iews &amp; then <a id="l5643"></a>to all Nations to drink, saying <em class="underline">Drink ye &amp; be drunken, &amp; spue and <a id="l5644"></a>fall &amp; rise no more because of the sword which I send among you <a id="l5645"></a> – For lo I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my <a id="l5646"></a>name, &amp; should ye be utterly unpunished?

Therefore prophesy thou against <a id="l5649"></a>them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar <a id="l5650"></a>from on high, &amp; utter his voice form his holy habitation, he shall <a id="l5651"></a>mightily roar upon his habitation, he shall give a shout as they <a id="l5652"></a>that treat the grapes against all the inhabitants of the earth – for the <a id="l5653"></a>Lord hath a controversy with all nations – he will give them that <a id="l5654"></a>are wicked to the sword – &amp; the slain of the Lord shall be at that day</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p156r"> &lt;156r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth</em>. Here <a id="l5655"></a>you see again the treading of the winepess, &amp; the drinking the wine-cup <a id="l5656"></a>of God's fury made types of the same signification. For the cup of the <a id="l5657"></a>wine of the wrath of God is nothing else then the blood of the grapes <a id="l5658"></a>trod out of the great winepress of the wrath of God.</p>
<p id="par205">In the aforesaid prophesy of Isaiah the resurrection &amp; judgment <a id="l5659"></a>of the dead about the time of battel of the great day is insinuated <a id="l5660"></a>both in the flourishing of their bones as an herb, &amp; in the vision <a id="l5661"></a>of the carcasses of the transgressors whose worm dieth not, and <a id="l5662"></a>whose fire is not quenched: but the resurrection at this time is <a id="l5663"></a>more clearly predicted by Isaiah in another place. <em class="underline">In this <a id="l5664"></a>mountain</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">shall the Lord of Host make unto all people a <a id="l5665"></a>Feast of fat things, a feast of wine on the Lees, of fat things full <a id="l5666"></a>of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

<p id="par206">To the prophesies hitherto explained may be added others to the same <a id="l5699"></a>purpose. As the promise to Abraham to give the land of Canaan <a id="l5700"></a>(that land which he then beheld, &amp; walked through)_ to him &amp; his seed <a id="l5701"></a>for ever Gen. 13.16 for an everlasting possession by an everlasting <a id="l5702"></a>covenant with his seed in their generations chap. 17.7, 8.

Hence I observe these things, first that <a id="l5728"></a>the restauration of the Iewish nation so much spoken of by the old Pro<a id="l5729"></a>phets respects not the few Iews who were converted in the Apostles <a id="l5730"></a>days, but the dispersed nations of the unbeleiving Iews to be converted <a id="l5731"></a>in the end when the fulness of the Gentiles shal enter, that is when <a id="l5732"></a>the Gospel (upon the fall of Babylon) shal be in to be preached to all <a id="l5733"></a>the Gospel (upon the fall of Babylon) shal begin to be preached to all <a id="l5734"></a>Nations. Secondly that the prophesies of Isaiah described above by being <a id="l5735"></a>here cited by the Apostle is limited to respect the time of the future <a id="l5736"></a>conversion &amp; restitution of the Iewish Nation, &amp; thirdly that the humour <a id="l5737"></a>which has long reigned among the Christians of boasting our selves against <a id="l5738"></a>the Iews, &amp; insulting over them for their not beleiving, is reprehended <a id="l5739"></a>by the Apostle for high-mindedness, &amp; self-conceipt, &amp; much more is <a id="l5740"></a>our using them despightfully, Pharisaicall &amp; impious.</p>
<p id="par208">Conformable to this of Paul is the prophesy of Christ as it is reported <a id="l5741"></a>by Luke. <em class="underline">there shal be great distress in the land &amp; wrath upon this <a id="l5742"></a>people, &amp; they shal fall by the edge of the sword &amp; shal be led away <a id="l5743"></a>captive into all nations &amp; Ierusalem shal be troden down of the Gentiles <a id="l5744"></a>untill the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled</em>. But because Luke who <a id="l5745"></a>wrote his Gospel by  information  others doth often alter the <a id="l5746"></a>order of things, as may be seen in the  sermon on the mount which he breaks into several pieces &amp; disperses them into several parts of <a id="l5747"></a>his Gospel as if spoken on several occasions, &amp; because he doth not relate <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p159r"> &lt;159r&gt; </span> this prophesy of Christ entire but sets down part of it in the 21<sup>th</sup> <a id="l5748"></a>part in the 12<sup>th</sup> part in the 17<sup>th</sup> &amp; part in the 19<sup>th</sup> Chapters of his Gospel &amp; varies <a id="l5749"></a>the phrase from what we find it in Matthew, who was an eye-witness of <a id="l5750"></a>what he wrote &amp; had the promise of his spirit to strengthen his <a id="l5751"></a>memory &amp; wrote first of any Man, &amp; seems to keep a good order in <a id="l5752"></a>the things &amp; relate them entire, &amp; therefore I had rather take the <a id="l5753"></a>prophesy as it lives in Matthew.</p>
<p id="par209">The prophesy was in answer to this question, <em class="underline">When shal these <a id="l5754"></a>things be</em> [viz<sup>t</sup> the destruction of the Temple?] &amp; what shal <a id="l5755"></a><em class="underline">be the sign of thy coming &amp; of the end of the world?</em> &amp; therefore <a id="l5756"></a>in the Prophesy we are to expect an answer to all these things. <a id="l5757"></a>And by consequence these words in the end of the prophesy [<em class="underline">And then <a id="l5758"></a>shal appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven &amp; then shal all the <a id="l5759"></a>tribes of the earth mourn &amp; they shall see the Son of Man coming in <a id="l5760"></a>the clouds of heaven with power &amp; great glory &amp; he shal send his Angels <a id="l5761"></a>with a great sound of a trumpet &amp; they shal gather together  his <a id="l5762"></a>Elect from the four winds from one end of the heaven to the other</em>] <a id="l5763"></a>are to be understand of Christ's coming to judgment in the end of <a id="l5764"></a>the world.</p>
<p id="par210">The circumstance of sending his Angels with the sound of a <a id="l5765"></a>Trumpet to gather his Elect from the four winds is that which Paul <a id="l5766"></a>speaks of when he saith that Christ shal descend from heaven with the <a id="l5767"></a>Trumpet of God, &amp; the dead in Christ shal rise first, &amp; then we <a id="l5768"></a>which are alive shal be caught up together with them in the clouds <a id="l5769"></a>to meet the Lord in the air. So in the parable of the harvest where <a id="l5770"></a>the Master saith the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares <a id="l5771"></a>&amp; bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my <a id="l5772"></a>barn: &amp; the harvest is interpreted to be the end of the world &amp; the <a id="l5773"></a>reapers to be the Angels. <em class="underline">As therefore the tares are gathered <a id="l5774"></a>&amp; burnt in the fire, so shal it be in the end of this world. The Son <a id="l5775"></a>of Man shal send forth his Angels &amp; they shal</em> [first] <em class="underline">gather out <a id="l5776"></a>of his kingdome all things that offend &amp; them which do iniquity &amp; shal <a id="l5777"></a>cast them into a furnace of fire. There shal be wailing and <a id="l5778"></a>gnashing of teeth. Then shal the righteous</em> [also gathered from the <a id="l5779"></a>four winds by those reapers the Angels] <em class="underline">shine forth as the Sun in the</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p160r"> &lt;160r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">Kingdom of their Father. Matt. 13. Then shal two be in the field <a id="l5780"></a>one shal be taken &amp; the other left. Two weomen shal be grinding <a id="l5781"></a>at the mill &amp; one shal be taken &amp; the other left</em>. Matt. 24.40 <em class="underline">In that <a id="l5782"></a>night there shal be two men in one bed the one shal be taken &amp; the <a id="l5783"></a>other left –  And they answered &amp; said unto him where Lord? and <a id="l5784"></a>he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the Eagles</em> <a id="l5785"></a>[that is the Angels] <em class="underline">be gathered together</em>. Luke 17.34, 37. Matt. 24.<a id="l5786"></a>28. And this gathering of the elect by the Angels is a second reason <a id="l5787"></a>why I think the coming of Christ in the clouds cannot be understood <a id="l5788"></a>by any other coming then that real one in the end of the world.</p>
<p id="par211">Another reason is the great mystery that is made of this day &amp; <a id="l5789"></a>our being commanded to watch because of it, &amp; that some are then <a id="l5790"></a>rewarded others cast into hell. <em class="underline">Of that day &amp; hour saith he knoweth <a id="l5791"></a>no man, no not the <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> But as the <a id="l5792"></a>days of <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span>watch <a id="l5793"></a>therefore for ye <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span>Lord doth come – <a id="l5794"></a>Blessed is he whom the Lord when <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> find so <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span> <a id="l5795"></a>Verify I say unto you that <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l5796"></a>goods, But &amp; if the evil servant shal say <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> Lord de<a id="l5797"></a>layeth his coming I shal begin to smite his fellow servants &amp; to eat <a id="l5798"></a>&amp; drink with the drunken, the Lord of that servant shal come in a day <a id="l5799"></a>when he looketh out for him, &amp; in an hour that he is not aware of <a id="l5800"></a>&amp; shal cut him off &amp; appoint him his portion with the hypocrites, there <a id="l5801"></a>shall be weeping &amp; gnashing of teeth</em> Matt. 24.36, 42, 48. To these <a id="l5802"></a>may be added the three Parables which follow in the next chapter &amp; were <a id="l5803"></a>spoken at the same time concerning the same coming. And he that shal interpret <a id="l5804"></a>all these things of any thing else then Christs coming to judgment <a id="l5805"></a>in the end of the world, lays a foundation for perverting all the prophe<a id="l5806"></a>sies of Christ's real coming to judgment &amp; of the resurrection of the <a id="l5807"></a>body and of heaven and hell and of eluding and ridiculing them <a id="l5808"></a>all.</p>
<p id="par212">A fourth reason is the full &amp; express description of his coming <a id="l5809"></a>compared with the like descriptions in other places of scripture. <em class="underline">Then, <a id="l5810"></a>saith he, shal appear the sign of the son of man in heaven &amp; then</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p161r"> &lt;161r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">shal all the tribes of the earth mourn &amp; they shal see the Son of <a id="l5811"></a>Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power &amp; great glory</em>. Can <a id="l5812"></a>any description of Christs second coming &amp; personal appearance <a id="l5813"></a>be more exprest? &amp; is not this the same with that in the Apocalyps? <a id="l5814"></a><em class="underline">Behold he cometh with clouds &amp; every eye shal see him &amp; they also <a id="l5815"></a>which pierced him &amp; all kindred of the earth shal wail because of <a id="l5816"></a>him: Even so, Amen</em>. Those who pervert these prophesies &amp; <a id="l5817"></a>apply them to the siege of Ierusalem by the Romans as if Christ here <a id="l5818"></a>came only to judgment in the Roman armies against the Iews make <a id="l5819"></a>this mourning of all the tribes of the earth to be nothing else <a id="l5820"></a>but the lamenting of the Iews at the desolation of Ierusalem. But <a id="l5821"></a>if they would but compare the Scriptures they might find it other<a id="l5822"></a>wise in Zechary. <em class="underline">Behold</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">I will make Ierusalem a <a id="l5823"></a>cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shal <a id="l5824"></a>be in  the siege both <a id="l5825"></a>against Iudah &amp; against Ierusalem. And in that day I will make <a id="l5826"></a>Ierusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden them<a id="l5827"></a>selves with it shal be cut in pieces thô all the people of the earth <a id="l5828"></a>I will defend the inhabitants of Ierusalem &amp; he that is feeble among <a id="l5829"></a>them at that day shal be as David, &amp; the house of David shal be as God, <a id="l5830"></a>as the Angel of the Lord before them. And it shal come to pass in <a id="l5831"></a>that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Ie<a id="l5832"></a>rusalem. And I will pour upon the house of David, &amp; upon the inha<a id="l5833"></a>bitants of Ierusalem the spirit of grace &amp; of supplications, &amp; they <a id="l5834"></a>shal look upon me whom they have pierced, &amp; they shal mourn <a id="l5835"></a>for him as one mourneth for his only begotten son &amp; shal be in bitter<a id="l5836"></a>ness for him as one that is in bitterness for his first born – &amp; all the land <a id="l5837"></a>shall mourn every family apart – &amp; all the families that remain every <a id="l5838"></a>family apart</em>. Zech. 12. This is the seing the Son of Man &amp; mourning <a id="l5839"></a>for him described in Matthew &amp; Iohn, &amp; this is not at the captivity <a id="l5840"></a>of Ierusalem but when all the Nations who come against it are <a id="l5841"></a>cut in pieces; not of the wicked incredulous &amp; captivated Iews but of the pious <a id="l5842"></a>converted &amp; victorious; not for their desolation &amp; captivity, but for the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p162r"> &lt;162r&gt; </span>piercing of him whom they looked upon: nor was the Son of Man who <a id="l5843"></a>here appeared to them a Roman heathen Emperor, but Christ <a id="l5844"></a>himself whom the nations of the mourners had pierced.</p>
<p id="par213">Another reason is the manner of Christs coming which is said <a id="l5845"></a>to be not after the manner of fals Christs gathering armies in <a id="l5846"></a>the deserts or hiding themselves for a time in the secret chambers, <a id="l5847"></a>not after any such humane way but in the clouds with great <a id="l5848"></a>glory like lightning with cometh out of the east &amp; shineth into <a id="l5849"></a>the west. I would fain understand how any man could by this des<a id="l5850"></a>cription of his coming know that he came in the Roman armies against <a id="l5851"></a>Ierusalem.</p>
<p id="par214">Another reason is that in applying this Prophesy to the siege of Ie<a id="l5852"></a>rusalem, the great tribulation must be in the siege, &amp; so Christs com<a id="l5853"></a>ing in the Roman armies against the Iews must precede the great <a id="l5854"></a>tribulation: which is downright to contradict a prophesy. For his <a id="l5855"></a>coming described in Matthew is not till some time after the tribulation <a id="l5856"></a>be ended. But it is easier to <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> men to swallow contradictions <a id="l5857"></a>then to forego their prejudices.</p>
<p id="par215">And lastly this coming of Christ is limited to the end of the world <a id="l5858"></a>by the whole series of the things in the prophesy they being the same <a id="l5859"></a>with those described in the Apocalyps &amp; old Prophets &amp; succeeding in <a id="l5860"></a>the same order. For next before this coming of the Son of Man in the <a id="l5861"></a>clouds is the smiting of the Sun Moon &amp; Stars, &amp; shaking the powers <a id="l5862"></a>of the heavens &amp; this is that which Ioel saith; The Sun shall be turned <a id="l5863"></a>into darkness, &amp; the Moon into blood before the great &amp; terrible <a id="l5864"></a>day of the Lord come. The same is insinuated in the Apocalyps by <a id="l5865"></a>the passing away of the first heaven &amp; earth before the resurrection <a id="l5866"></a>of the dead, &amp; before a new heaven &amp; earth &amp; new Ierusalem be created, <a id="l5867"></a>&amp; then adding that the new city had no need of the Sun neither of the <a id="l5868"></a>Moon to shine in it for the glory of God did enlighten it, &amp; the Lamb <a id="l5869"></a>is the light thereof: that is the city had no other King thou God and <a id="l5870"></a>the Lamb with his vicegerent on earth.</p>
<p id="par216">Immediately before the smiting of the Luminaries is the great <a id="l5871"></a>tribulation in Matthew, &amp; therefore 'tis the same with the great tribulation <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p163r"> &lt;163r&gt; </span> at the end of the world in Daniel &amp; Iohn. When the Palm-bearing <a id="l5872"></a>multitude come out of the great tribulation 'tis said that they <a id="l5873"></a>shal no more nor thirst any more, neither shal the Sun light <a id="l5874"></a>on them nor any heat, &amp; God shal wipe away all tears from <a id="l5875"></a>their eys. Which is as much as to say that in that tribulation they <a id="l5876"></a>shal hunger &amp; thirst &amp; lament &amp; the Sun shal light on them, <a id="l5877"></a>but immediately after the tribulation (as Matthew expresses it) <a id="l5878"></a>the Sun shal be darkened &amp; light on them no more. So again <a id="l5879"></a>in the war between the word of God &amp; the Beast which begins (with <a id="l5880"></a>begins with this tribulation) an Angel (the type of the Church) <a id="l5881"></a>stands in the hot burning sun &amp; calls all the fowls of heaven to <a id="l5882"></a>the supper of the great God, but after that war is ended the new <a id="l5883"></a>Ierusalem has no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine <a id="l5884"></a>in it. In the tribulation is the harvest of the Saints, &amp; in the <a id="l5885"></a>smiting of the terrestrial luminaries the vintage of the wicked <a id="l5886"></a>&amp; the harvest immediately precedes the vintage.</p>
<p id="par217">Next before the tribulation (as well in Matthew as in the Apocalyps) <a id="l5887"></a>is the general preaching of the Gospel in all the world, &amp; next before <a id="l5888"></a>that the great apostacy introduced by the many fals Prophets &amp; the <a id="l5889"></a>abounding of iniquity &amp; the waxing cold of the love of many. All <a id="l5890"></a>which will be left understood by perusing the prophesy in order.</p>
<p id="par218"><em class="underline">And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came <a id="l5891"></a>unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? <a id="l5892"></a>&amp; what shal be the sign of thy coming</em> [to restore the Kingdom <a id="l5893"></a>of Israel Act. 1.6. Luke 24.21] <em class="underline">&amp; of the end of the world? And <a id="l5894"></a>Iesus answered &amp; said unto them take heed that no man deceive you: <a id="l5895"></a>for many shal come in my name, saying, I am Christ, &amp; shall <a id="l5896"></a>deceive many. And ye shall hear of wars &amp; rumors of wars</em> <a id="l5897"></a>[wherein this nation shal be led captive:] <em class="underline">see that ye be not troubled: <a id="l5898"></a>for all these things must come to pass, but the end</em> [of the world] <a id="l5899"></a><em class="underline">is not yet. For</em>  [Ierusalem must be troden down of the Gentiles <a id="l5900"></a>till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled, &amp;] <em class="underline">Nation shall rise a<a id="l5901"></a>gainst nation, &amp; kingdom against kingdom, &amp; there shall be famines</em> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p164r"> &lt;164r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">&amp; pestilences &amp; earthquakes in divers places. All these are the begin<a id="l5902"></a>nings of sorrows. Then shal they deliver you up to be afflicted <a id="l5903"></a>&amp; shal be hated</em> [not only of the Iews as at the first preaching of the <a id="l5904"></a>Gospel but even] <em class="underline">of all nations for my Names sake. And then <a id="l5905"></a>shall many</em> [of my own disciples] <em class="underline">&amp; shal betray one another and <a id="l5906"></a>shall hate one another, &amp; many fals Prophets</em> [which say they <a id="l5907"></a>are Apostles &amp; are not but do lye Apoc. 2.2, fals teachers <a id="l5908"></a>which men shall heap to themselves having itching east 1 Tim. 4.3 <a id="l5909"></a>&amp; which shall become the great fals Prophet spoken of in the Apocalyps, <a id="l5910"></a>these] <em class="underline">shal rise &amp; shall deceive many</em> [&amp; thereby bring in the great <a id="l5911"></a>Apostacy] <em class="underline">&amp; because iniquity shall abound</em> [in the Churches, they <a id="l5912"></a>shall leave their first love Apoc. 2.4 &amp;] <em class="underline">the love of the multitude <a id="l5913"></a>shall wax cold, but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall <a id="l5914"></a>be saved.

<p id="par219">The word γενεὰ generation is here ambiguous &amp; may signify either <a id="l5970"></a>an age or a stock, race &amp; progeny of men. Christ would have his <a id="l5971"></a>disciples always upon the watch, &amp; therefore to put his auditors in the <a id="l5972"></a>greater expectation chuses such a word, as by being misinterpreted, might <a id="l5973"></a>make them expect it even in that age. He went up &amp; down preaching <a id="l5974"></a><em class="underline">The kingdom of heaven is at hand</em> &amp; sent his disciples to preach the <a id="l5975"></a>same doctrine, &amp; always worded his discourses so as to put his disciples <a id="l5976"></a>upon expectation. In the Apocalyps, he saith, <em class="underline">Behold, I come quickly; <a id="l5977"></a>&amp; my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be. When his disciples askt him, will thou at this time restore again the <a id="l5978"></a>kingdom to Israel?</em> because the knowledge of the time would cross the <a id="l5979"></a>design of his preaching he tells them  it was not for them to know <a id="l5980"></a>the times &amp; seasons which God had put in his own bosom. Whom Peter asked <a id="l5981"></a>what Iohn should do, Iesus answers, <em class="underline">If I will that he tarry till I <a id="l5982"></a>come what is that to thee?</em> The ambiguity of which answer made the <a id="l5983"></a>disciples think that Iohn should live till the coming of Christ &amp; by con<a id="l5984"></a>sequence not dye. Yet Iohn informs us that Christ meant no such <a id="l5985"></a>thing. Christ doth not say that Iohn should tarry till his coming, &amp; <a id="l5986"></a>if he had said so, Iohn might tarry as well after death as before <a id="l5987"></a>it. Again in sending the twelve to preach he tells them that <em class="underline">they should <a id="l5988"></a>not finish the cities of Israel till the Son of Man be come</em>. Ὀυ μὴ τε<a id="l5989"></a>λέσητε, <a id="l5990"></a>ye shall not finish, is an ambiguous expression &amp; may sig<a id="l5991"></a>nify either that they should not preach to  all the cities or that they should <a id="l5992"></a>not finish the conversion of all Israel before the Son of Man be come. In the first <a id="l5993"></a>sense they finished the cities long enough before the siege of Ierusalem, in the <a id="l5994"></a>second they have not done it yet nor shall have fully done it before the <a id="l5995"></a>Son of Man be come. Son in another place speaking of eternal life &amp; eternal <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p167r"> &lt;167r&gt; </span> death he saith: <em class="underline">whosoever will save his life</em> [in this world] <em class="underline">shall lose <a id="l5996"></a>it</em> [by the tasting the second death in the world to come] <em class="underline">&amp; whosoever <a id="l5997"></a>will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited <a id="l5998"></a>if he shall gain the whole world &amp; lose his own soul? For the Son of <a id="l5999"></a>Man shall come in the glory of his Father with his Angels &amp; then he <a id="l6000"></a>shal reward every man according to his work Verily I say unto you <a id="l6001"></a>there be some standing here which shal not last of death till they <a id="l6002"></a>see the son of man coming in his kingdom</em>. This last sentence is <a id="l6003"></a>plainly designed to put his hearers in expectation of his coming even <a id="l6004"></a>while some of them remained alive, &amp; yet the context plainly shews <a id="l6005"></a>that he speaks of the second death, that death which some there should <a id="l6006"></a>dye when he came to reward every man according to his works, the <a id="l6007"></a>death of those who should lose their lives by saving them, the losing <a id="l6008"></a>of their soules spoken of immediately before, the death of which <a id="l6009"></a>Christ speaks at other times when he said: <em class="underline">If a man keep my <a id="l6010"></a>saying he shal never last of death</em> Iohn 8.51, 52. <em class="underline">He that be<a id="l6011"></a>leiveth in me shal never dye</em>, Iohn 11.26. <em class="underline">Your fathers did eat <a id="l6012"></a>Manna in the wilderness, &amp; are dead: this is the bread which cometh <a id="l6013"></a>down from heaven that a man may eat thereof &amp; not dye</em>. Iohn 6.<a id="l6014"></a>50. So then in describing his coming to judgment to put them <a id="l6015"></a>upon the watch he useth the ambiguous saying. <em class="underline">This generation <a id="l6016"></a>shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled</em>; &amp; by this genera<a id="l6017"></a>tion means this people or progeny of the Iews; or more strictly <a id="l6018"></a>this wicked &amp; adulterous generation, this faithless &amp; perverse ge<a id="l6019"></a>neration, this generation of vipers, this generation by which the Son <a id="l6020"></a>of Man should be rejected. When all these things shall be fulfil<a id="l6021"></a>led them shall this generation, by the finall &amp; total conversion of Israel, <a id="l6022"></a>pass away, &amp; not before. In a word I do not know why any one place <a id="l6023"></a>in  the scrip<a id="l6024"></a>ture where the coming of the Son of Man is taken otherwise there li<a id="l6025"></a>terally for one of his two personal comings.</p>
<p id="par220">And what I say of the coming of the Son of Man is also to be under<a id="l6026"></a>stood by the coming of the kingdom of Heaven. He &amp; his kingdom come <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p168r"> &lt;168r&gt; </span> together. For he shal judg the quick &amp; the dead at his appearing in <a id="l6027"></a>his kingdom 2 Tim. 4.1. This was the expectation of the Iews and <a id="l6028"></a>Christ never confutes it, thô he sometimes corrects their notions <a id="l6029"></a>about it. But then there is a great difference between his <a id="l6030"></a>two comings &amp; the kingdoms belonging to each. For he came not <a id="l6031"></a>the first time as a King over Men, &amp; therefore the kingdom of <a id="l6032"></a>God or Heaven is never spoken of the Church at his first coming, <a id="l6033"></a>but only of the invisible powers of heaven then commanded by <a id="l6034"></a>him. This was all the regal power &amp; kingdom he then came <a id="l6035"></a>with &amp; therefore when ever the kingdom of heaven is spoken <a id="l6036"></a>of his first coming, which is but seldome, 'tis to be understood of <a id="l6037"></a>this invisible one. Thus when the Pharisees said he cast out De<a id="l6038"></a>vils by the Prince of Devils: he answers that if Satan cast out <a id="l6039"></a>Satan his kingdom is divided &amp; cannot stand, <em class="underline">but if I, saith <a id="l6040"></a>he, cast out devils by</em> [the  authority not of Beelzebub their <a id="l6041"></a>Prince, but of] <em class="underline">the Spirit of God</em> [to whom the Angels are sub<a id="l6042"></a>ject] <em class="underline">then</em> [tis not the kingdom of Satan, but the kingdom of God <a id="l6043"></a>whose Regal power I exercise in casting them out, &amp; by this you <a id="l6044"></a>may know that the Messias is come &amp; that I am he because] <em class="underline">the king<a id="l6045"></a>dome of God is come upon you. Or els</em> [if I did not use the <a id="l6046"></a>power of a stronger kingdom then that of Satan how should <a id="l6047"></a>I cast not  those of his kingdom for] <em class="underline">how can one enter <a id="l6048"></a>into a strong mans house &amp; spoile his goods except he first <a id="l6049"></a>bind the Strong Man</em> Matt. 12.28. And in the same sense Christ <a id="l6050"></a>tells the Pharisees that the kingdom of God was among them Luke <a id="l6051"></a>17.  The Iews were of opinion that the Messiah should come after <a id="l6052"></a>the manner of victorious Kings with the pomp &amp; outward shew of a <a id="l6053"></a>conqueror. To obviate this error Christ tells them <em class="underline">that the kingdom <a id="l6054"></a>of heaven</em> [which they are expectation of] <em class="underline">cometh not with <a id="l6055"></a>outward shew: neither shal they</em> [then] <em class="underline">say to here</em> [cometh the <a id="l6056"></a>Messiah] <em class="underline">or to there</em> [he is] <em class="underline">for behold the kingdom of heaven</em> <a id="l6057"></a>[which shal then come, even the Messias with his armies of Angels and <a id="l6058"></a>invisible heavenly powers] <em class="underline">is</em> [even now] <em class="underline">among you</em> [For I am that Messiahs &amp; by the present invisibility of my kingdom you may learn <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p169r"> &lt;169r&gt; </span> how it shal come hereafter. For my present coming is not that which <a id="l6059"></a>you expect. I must now leave you again &amp;] <em class="underline">the days will come <a id="l6060"></a>when ye shal desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, &amp; ye <a id="l6061"></a>shal not see it. And they shal say to you see here</em> [he cometh] <a id="l6062"></a><em class="underline">or see there: go not after them nor follow them. For as the <a id="l6063"></a>lightning that lightened out of one part under heaven shineth unto <a id="l6064"></a>the other part under heaven, so shal also the Son of Man be in his <a id="l6065"></a>day</em> [when he cometh in his kingdom of the Angels &amp; Saints] <em class="underline">but <a id="l6066"></a>he must first suffer many things &amp; be rejected of this generation</em>. <a id="l6067"></a>Luke 17.20. This I take to be the true meaning of these places <a id="l6068"></a>&amp; I think these are almost the only ones where the Kingdom of <a id="l6069"></a>heaven is applied to Christs first coming. For when he saith that the kingdom of heaven shal be taken from the Iews &amp; given to another <a id="l6070"></a>Nation the meaning is only that many shal come from the East &amp; from the <a id="l6071"></a>West &amp; sit down with Abraham &amp; with Isaac &amp; with Jacob in the kingdom <a id="l6072"></a>of heaven while the children of the kingdom are cast out. Where he <a id="l6073"></a>speaks of the Gospel of the kingdome, he means the Gospel concerning <a id="l6074"></a>the future kingdom. Where any Parables concerning the kingdom of <a id="l6075"></a>heaven include the Saints on earth 'tis only with respect to the kingdom <a id="l6076"></a>which they are to inherit. When he saith the kingdom of heaven is <a id="l6077"></a>at hand 'tis nothing more then when he saith, Behold I come <a id="l6078"></a>quickly &amp; my reward is with me: or the Devil came down with great <a id="l6079"></a>wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time or the re<a id="l6080"></a>relation of Iesus Christ which God gave unto him to shew unto his <a id="l6081"></a>servants things which must shortly come to pass. That which is a long <a id="l6082"></a>time with us is a short one with God, for with him a thousand years is <a id="l6083"></a>but as one day &amp; as a watch in the night. Psal. 90.4. So then they <a id="l6084"></a>are much mistaken who by the kingdom of heaven in the Gospels un<a id="l6085"></a>der stand any state of Men before the Second coming of Christ.</p>
<p id="par221">If it be objected that lathô the coming of the Son of Man in the <a id="l6086"></a>clouds of heaven with power &amp; great glory (Matt. 24) be his coming <a id="l6087"></a>to the last judgment, yet the great tribulation may be that of the Iews <a id="l6088"></a>in the siege of Ierusalem. For part of the description of that tribe<a id="l6089"></a>lotion is in Luke's Gospel conjoyned with the war of the Romans against <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p170r"> &lt;170r&gt; </span> Ierusalem. I answer that another part of the description of the same <a id="l6090"></a>tribulation is by Luke in the end of the 17<sup>th</sup> Chapter of his Gospel con<a id="l6091"></a>joined with Christs second coming, &amp; therefore his Gospel makes <a id="l6092"></a>as much for as against the interpretation we have given. 'Tis there<a id="l6093"></a>fore to be considered that the Prophesy is an answer to a double Que's<a id="l6094"></a>Sion; the one concerning the destruction of the Temple, the other con<a id="l6095"></a>corning the coming of Christ to restore the kingdom of Israel. The <a id="l6096"></a>last question as the most material is most insisted upon by Matthew, <a id="l6097"></a>the first as being nearest at hand &amp; perhaps (whatever the ancients <a id="l6098"></a>write to the contrary) brought to pass before Luke published his <a id="l6099"></a>Gospel, is only proposed by Luke &amp; most insisted upon by him. Both <a id="l6100"></a>might be described by expressions much of a kind as are the fals Christs <a id="l6101"></a>in both comings, &amp; how to distinguish the expressions may be now difficult, <a id="l6102"></a>nor can we say how far he kept the due order of the sentences &amp; form <a id="l6103"></a>of expressions.</p>
