<p id="par6">And to excommunicate or anathematize men for any thing which was not taught <a id="l17"></a>from the beginning in catech<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>i<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>ï<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>sing, is to make a new fundamental article of the <a id="l18"></a>Christian religion, an article which ought to be taught in catechizing before baptism into the remissions <a id="l19"></a>of sins &amp; admission into communion. </p>
<p id="par7">The Law of Moses was good if a man could keep it, but it was not necessary to <a id="l20"></a>salvation &amp; therefore the Apostle would not suffer it to be imposed on the Gentiles  <a id="l21"></a>as a fundamental Article of religion necessary to salvation  but said that such an <a id="l22"></a>imposition would be a preaching of another Gospel &amp; a making void the faith of Christ. And <a id="l23"></a>the case is the same with every new Article of communion not imposed  before <a id="l24"></a>baptism from the beginning of the Gospel. It is not enough that it be good or true. It <a id="l25"></a>must be such a truth as is necessary to the remission of sins. After baptism &amp; ad<a id="l26"></a>mission into communion men are to grow in grace &amp;  the knowledge of our Lord I. C. They are to study other truths &amp; teach them to one another <a id="l27"></a> but not to fall out about them. The strong must not must not despise <a id="l28"></a>the weak &amp; the weak must not judge the strong :  much less must they anathematize one another</p>
<p id="par8">This primitive Christian religion was preserved entire in the Greek Church ( especially among the <a id="l29"></a>Churches of Asia ) till the fourth Century: but began to be violated by the Latines <a id="l30"></a>before the end of the second. For Pope Victor excommunicated the Churches of Asia <a id="l31"></a>for keeping Easter on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of the Moon, &amp; thereby made it a fundamental <a id="l32"></a>article of religion to keep Easter on the same day with the Church of Rome. <a id="l33"></a>And in the third century Pope Stephen excommunicated those who disallowed <a id="l34"></a>the Baptism performed by hereticks. And the African Churches in Cyprians days <a id="l35"></a>denyed Baptism to those who did not believe in the remission<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>s<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of sins &amp; life <a id="l36"></a>everlasting through the holy Church. And in the beginning of the fourth century <a id="l37"></a>the Council of Eliberis in Spain excommunicated those who in the day time <a id="l38"></a>lighted wax candles in the cæmeteries or burying places  of the dead because the <a id="l39"></a>spirits of the dead Saints were not to be disquieted. </p>

<p id="par19">And first Tatian a disciple of Iustin Martyr, about year 171 lapsing <a id="l128"></a>into Gnosticism joyned several errors of Saturninus <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Marcion<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; Valentinus <a id="l129"></a>with his own making invisible Æons with Valentinus &amp; condemning marriage <a id="l130"></a>with Saturnius &amp; Marcion as unlawfull, &amp; introducing abstinence from  <a id="l131"></a>divers sorts of meats &amp; from wine, pretending to lead a sober &amp; austere life. <a id="l132"></a>And from thence this new sect had the name of Encratites or Continents. And <a id="l133"></a>tho this sort of abstinence from things lawfull was soon condemned as the <a id="l134"></a>Heresy of the Encratites yet being specious &amp; plausible it gained many <a id="l135"></a>followers &amp; at length ended in  the abstemious sects of  Moncks &amp; Nunns  <a id="l136"></a> to whom marriage is forbidden &amp; in abstinence <a id="l138"></a>from  flesh on fasting days. </p>
<p id="par20">Tatian was presented followed by Montanus who refining upon the <a id="l139"></a>errors of the Gnosticks rejected their fabulous Æons, received all the <a id="l140"></a>books of the old &amp; new Testament,  forbade second marriages as <a id="l141"></a>fornication, allowed of divorces, appointed annual fasting days, &amp; made a <a id="l142"></a>singular shew of some unusual rigours &amp; severities in religion.  Some of his followers made the father son &amp; Holy Ghost <a id="l144"></a>to have one common substance, &amp; these were called κατὰ Æschynem, &amp; <a id="l145"></a>hence came the Praxeans, Noetians Patripassians &amp; Sabellians.

<p id="par21">He tells us that he had learnt from the Paraclete <a id="l152"></a> ( so he calls Montanus ) that there was one only God; yet under this dispensation <a id="l153"></a>that  this one God had a Son  his Word which proceeded from him <a id="l154"></a>&amp; by whom all things were made. He saith that God was always rational &amp; <a id="l155"></a>that his reason was older then his Word . That by his reason he first disposed <a id="l156"></a>all things in his own  mind by thinking,  &amp; when he was minded to produce them in their proper substances<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span> . <span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; species he firstly emitted his Word having in it its individuals, Reason &amp; Wisdom. For this was wanting to the things in his mind that they should exist  before him in their proper species &amp; substances <a id="l157"></a>&amp; that his reason then received its proper species &amp; ornament, namely sound <a id="l158"></a>&amp; voice, when God said, Let there be light. And this was the perfect na<a id="l159"></a>tivity of his Word while it proceeded from God. And this Word has its proper <a id="l160"></a>substance. For tho the word of a man is void of substance yet nothing void <a id="l161"></a>of substance can proceed from so great a substance &amp; the author of so many <a id="l162"></a>substances as God is. And this substance he calls a person &amp; the son of <a id="l163"></a>God, &amp; προβολὴν an emission projection or prolation of one thing from another .  And <a id="l164"></a> if it be objected that this is to introduce the Prolations of Valentinus <a id="l165"></a>who produced Æons from one another: he answers, that it is no good <a id="l166"></a>reason against using this language because a heresy used it; that the <a id="l167"></a>heresy had it from the truth, the Son being Probola veritatis ; &amp; that <a id="l168"></a>Valentinus separated his Probolas from their author &amp; put them so far <a id="l169"></a>asunder that Æon knows not the father; but with the disciples of Montanus <a id="l170"></a>the son alone knows the father, &amp; is always in his bosom, &amp; never separa<a id="l171"></a>ted from him. They say that the son was emitted from him but not se<a id="l172"></a>perated.   Montanus  teaching that God produced the Word   as a root produces <a id="l173"></a>a plant, &amp; a fountain a river, &amp; the sun a ray, &amp; the plant is not sepa<a id="l174"></a>rate from the root nor the river from the fountain nor the ray from <a id="l175"></a> the sun. The son is the second from God but not separated, &amp; the Holy <a id="l176"></a>Ghost is the third from the father &amp; the son as the fruit from the plant <a id="l177"></a>is the third from the root &amp; the  flood from the  River is the third from the <a id="l178"></a>fountain &amp; the focus from the ray is the third from the Sun, but without <a id="l179"></a>being separated from them<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span> . <span class="nb-n">}</span></span> The father is the whole substance &amp; the <a id="l180"></a>Son a derivation &amp; portion of the whole, as he himself professeth saying <a id="l181"></a>that the Father is greater then me. And yet as the Father is every where so also the son is every where with the father.  And  by this economy  the Trinity is but <a id="l182"></a>but one God in substance undivided, tho  distinguished into three <a id="l183"></a>persons For he calls the Son the second person in the Trinity &amp; the Holy Ghost the third.  . This was the philosophy of Montanus according to Tertullian. <a id="l184"></a>But it was not received in those days by the generality of Christians <a id="l185"></a>either Latines or Greeks.  They looked upon it as Polytheism &amp; shut their ears against it, <a id="l186"></a>comparing  these emissions or Æons of the Son &amp; Holy Ghost to the philosophy of the heathens who derived their Gods from <a id="l187"></a>the substance of the supreme God by emission. For Tertullian tells <a id="l188"></a>us: Simplices enim qui, ne dixerim imprudentes &amp; idiotæ, quæ major <a id="l189"></a>semper credentium pars est, quoniam et ipsa Regula fidei a pluribus <a id="l190"></a>Dijs sæculi ad unicum et verum Deum transfert, non intelligentes <a id="l191"></a>unicum quidem sed cum suæ <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>œcumnia<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> , esse credendum, expavescunt <a id="l192"></a>ad œconomiam. Numerum et dispositionem Trinitatis, divisionem presu<a id="l193"></a>munt unitatis ; quando unitas ex semetipsa derivans trinitatem, non <a id="l194"></a>destruatur ab illa, sed administretur.

Sed monarchiam <a id="l201"></a>sonare student Latini, œconomiam  intelligere nolunt etiam <a id="l202"></a>Græci. </p>
<p id="par22">Tertullian tells us further that the Word was made flesh not by <a id="l203"></a>transfiguration but by putting on flesh. For that which is transfigured ceases <a id="l204"></a>to be what it was &amp; begins to be something els, &amp; therefore if the <a id="l205"></a>Word was transfigured, Iesus would be a substance composed of two, <a id="l206"></a>a certain mixture of flesh &amp; spirit, as electrum  is a mixture of <a id="l207"></a>gold &amp; silver &amp; yet is neither of them but a third thing made of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p004r"> &lt;4r&gt; </span> both. But Christ is both God &amp; Man, both substances being distant <a id="l208"></a>each in its own property: because the Word is nothing else then God <a id="l209"></a>&amp; the flesh is nothing else then man. They are not confused but <a id="l210"></a>joyned in one person God &amp; Man. The property of each substance <a id="l211"></a>is preserved &amp; the spirit [ or Word ] did the signes &amp; miracles &amp; the <a id="l212"></a>flesh underwent the passions of hungering thirsting weeping being <a id="l213"></a>sorrowfull &amp;  dying on the cross. Of these two Iesus was <a id="l214"></a>composed being man of the flesh &amp; God of the Spirit, the son of man <a id="l215"></a>of the flesh &amp; the son of God of the spirit. And this was the doctrine of <a id="l216"></a>Montanists according to Tertullian. They made the son of God an Æon <a id="l217"></a>emitted from the father in the beginning of the creation  when <a id="l218"></a>God said Let there be light, &amp; generated by that emission, &amp; that he <a id="l219"></a>was incarnate  only by putting on flesh or dwelling in Iesus without <a id="l220"></a>any change in himself, so as to see with the eyes of the body as a man <a id="l221"></a>sees or hear with the ears of the body as a man hears, or remem<a id="l222"></a>ber by the help of the brain:  Then made him to continue the same person as <a id="l223"></a>before, the second person in the Trinity, the person who did the <a id="l224"></a>miracles, the person called the son of God. And the Man alone was the son of man the person who <a id="l225"></a>suffered &amp; died .  And yet both were at the same time united so as to become one &amp; <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> same person <a id="l226"></a>And much after the same manner some former  Gnosticks as  Irenæus tells us,  made the son of man  who suffered <a id="l228"></a>&amp; the son of God who did the miracles to be  united &amp; called them one .
