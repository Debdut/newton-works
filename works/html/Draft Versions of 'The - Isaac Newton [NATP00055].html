<p id="par1">When I made the foregoing Observations, I <a id="l1"></a>designed to repeat most of them with more care &amp; <a id="l2"></a>exactness, &amp; to make some new ones for determining <a id="l3"></a>the manner how the rays of light are bent in their <a id="l4"></a>passage by bodies, for making the fringes of colours with <a id="l5"></a>the dark lines between them. But I was then interrupted, <a id="l6"></a>&amp; cannot now think of taking these things into further <a id="l7"></a>consideration. And since I have not finished this part of <a id="l8"></a>my designe, I shall conclude, with proposing only some <a id="l9"></a>Quæres in order to a further search to be made by others.</p>
<p id="par2">Quære 1. Do not Bodies act upon light at a dis<a id="l10"></a>tance &amp; by their action bend its rays &amp; is not this action <a id="l11"></a>(cæteris paribus) strongest at the least distance?</p>
<p id="par3">Qu. 2. Do not the rays which differ in refrangibility <a id="l12"></a>differ also in flexibility &amp; are they not by their different <a id="l13"></a>inflexions separated from one another so as after separation <a id="l14"></a>to make the colours in the three fringes [above described? And <a id="l15"></a>after what manner are they inflected to make those fringes?</p>
<p id="par4">Qu. 3. Are not the rays of Light in passing <a id="l16"></a>by the edges &amp; sides of bodies bent  several times <a id="l17"></a>backwards &amp; forwards with a motion like that of an <a id="l18"></a>Eele? And do not the three fringes of coloured light above mentioned arise from three such bendings?</p>
<p id="par5">Qu. 4. Do not the rays of Light  which fall upon <a id="l19"></a>bodies &amp; are reflected or refracted, begin to bend before <a id="l20"></a>they arrive at the bodies; &amp; are they not reflected <a id="l21"></a>refracted &amp; inflected by one &amp; the same Principle <a id="l22"></a>acting variously in various circumstances?</p>
<p id="par6">Qu. 5. Do not Bodies &amp; Light act mutually <a id="l23"></a>upon one another, that is to say, Bodies upon Light in <a id="l24"></a>emitting, reflecting,  refracting &amp; inflecting it, and Light <a id="l25"></a>upon bodies for heating them &amp; putting their parts into a <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p232r"> &lt;232r&gt; </span> vibrating motion wherein heat consists?</p>
<p id="par7">Qu. 6. Do not black bodies conceive heat more <a id="l26"></a>easily from light then those of other colours do, by <a id="l27"></a>reason that the light falling on them is not reflected <a id="l28"></a>outwards but enters the bodies &amp; is often reflected &amp; <a id="l29"></a>refracted within them untill it be stifled &amp; lost?</p>
<p id="par8">Qu. 7. Is not the strength &amp; vigor of the action <a id="l30"></a>between Light &amp; sulphureous Bodies observed above, <a id="l31"></a>one reason why sulphureous bodies take fire more <a id="l32"></a>readily &amp; burn more vehemently then other Bodies do?</p>
<p id="par9">Qu. 8. Do not all fixt bodies when heated <a id="l33"></a>beyond a certain degree, emit light &amp; shine, &amp; is not this emission performed by the vibrating <a id="l34"></a>motions of their parts?</p>
<p id="par10">[Qu. 9. Is not fire a body heated so hot as to <a id="l35"></a>emit Light copiously? For what else is a red hot <a id="l36"></a>Iron then fire, &amp; what else is a burning coale then <a id="l37"></a>red hot wood?</p>
<p id="par11">Qu. 10.

<p id="par17">Qu.16.  Is not the free passage of  light through pellucid bodies an argument that all   bodies are very porous.   Water is nineteen times lighter in specie then Gold &amp; therefore <a id="l119"></a> since the matter in bodies is proportional to their gravity <a id="l120"></a>water would have eighteen times more pores then parts of gold were  perfectly solid or void of all <a id="l121"></a>pores. But gold is also very porous as appears by the soaking of quicksilver into it &amp; <a id="l122"></a> by the squeezing of water through it &amp; principally by the passage of light through its particles when  foliated or dissolved in Aqua <a id="l123"></a>regia. Were the pores of gold but equal to its parts the pores of rain water <a id="l124"></a>would  contain 37 times more space then its parts. And he that shall invent a  ratio<a id="l125"></a>nal Hypothesis for explaining how water can be so porous &amp; yet be uncapable <a id="l126"></a>of compression by force, may  doubtless by the same Hypothesis explain how gold may   be as porous as he pleases &amp; all other bodies as much more <a id="l128"></a>porous then gold as they are lighter in specie.  Suppose a body  were composed of <a id="l129"></a>parts lying together with as much pores between them, &amp; that these parts  were <a id="l130"></a>composed of smaller parts lying together with as much pores between them &amp; that these parts  were <a id="l131"></a>composed of parts still smaller with as much pores between them &amp; so on for as <a id="l132"></a>many compositions as you please  untill you come at solid parts void of all pores. <a id="l133"></a>And if in this progression there  were ten compositions,  the body  would have  <a id="l134"></a>above a thousand times more pores then parts; if twenty compositions, it would have above a thousand thousand <a id="l135"></a>times more pores then parts; if thirty compositions, it  would have above a thousand <a id="l136"></a>thousand thousand  times more pores then parts &amp; so on perpetually.  But whatever be the texture of bodies, they must be so porous as in all positions to give <a id="l138"></a>passage to the rays of light in right lines through their pores. For whatever the rays of light be <a id="l139"></a>whether  they consist in the vibrations of a medium, or be bodies trajected, if  <a id="l140"></a>in passing through the pores of pellucid bodies they do not find room enough to go on <a id="l141"></a>in right lines  whenever they are once  disturbed &amp; <a id="l142"></a>turned out of their direct courses, they will go on in their new courses till <a id="l143"></a>they are disturbed again, &amp; the more they are disturbed the more they <a id="l144"></a>will err &amp;  return no more to their first courses unless by very great <a id="l145"></a>accident. To suppose that  as  often as the rays of light are <a id="l146"></a>turned out of their way by some parts of the bodies, they will be turned <a id="l147"></a>into way again by others is as precarious &amp; extravagant as to suppose <a id="l148"></a>that  the suns light  can pass through <a id="l149"></a>a heap of sand &amp; after many reflexions emerge in the same right lines  in which  it came <a id="l150"></a>from the sun,  the sands being so disposed that some  reflexions shall turn the <a id="l151"></a>rays into their right course as often as others turn them out of their way. The <a id="l152"></a>great porousness &amp; admirable structure of bodies is further argued from the lastingness of the vibrating <a id="l153"></a>motions of their parts wherein heat consists,  For without great porousness the parts of bodies could no <a id="l156"></a>more vibrate then a  spring can tremble in the middst of a heap of sand.  And it may be further argued from the great capacity of  by corruption &amp; generation to put off &amp; put on all <a id="l159"></a>manner of forms,  &amp; be changed into all sorts of shapes.  The contrivance <a id="l160"></a>of the bodies of living creatures is admirable. Not a member but has its use <a id="l161"></a>&amp; is mighty well fitted for that use. And  can we beleive that he who <a id="l162"></a>contrived the bodies of animals with so much artifice  was not as skilful <a id="l163"></a>&amp; curious in  contriving   the texture  of matter for those ends for <a id="l165"></a>which it is fitted. For the forms &amp; uses of matter are  innumerable &amp; therefore <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p234v"> &lt;234v&gt; </span> we are not to consider it as composed of  irregular particles  casually laid together like stones in a heap, but as formed wisely for <a id="l167"></a>all those uses. One use of matter is  to admit menstruums easily into its pores <a id="l168"></a> in order to new mixtures  &amp; actions by fermentation putrefaction corruption &amp; generation, another to conceive heat easily <a id="l169"></a>&amp; keep it long for promoting changes by   putrefaction &amp; generation, a those <a id="l170"></a>to transmit  refract &amp; reflect light for producing all the <a id="l171"></a> colours of bodies  where in the beauty <a id="l172"></a>of nature  chiefly consists. Without these uses  the earth would have been <a id="l173"></a>a dead lump  void of heat &amp; motion  &amp; alteration &amp; variety of <a id="l174"></a>colours: &amp; therefore it is reasonable to allow that he who contrived <a id="l175"></a>all things with wisdome, framed matter in such a manner as to fit it best for these <a id="l176"></a>uses, &amp; by consequence made it very porous.</p>

<p id="par22">Quæst.24. May not the forces by which the small particles of <a id="l203"></a>bodies cohere &amp; act upon one another at small distances for producing the above mentioned phænomena <a id="l204"></a>of nature, be electric? For altho electric bodies do not act at a sensible <a id="l205"></a>distance unless their virtue be excited by friction, yet that vertue may <a id="l206"></a>not be generated by friction but only expanded. For the particles of all <a id="l207"></a>bodies may abound with an electric spirit which reaches not to any sensible <a id="l208"></a>distance from the particles unless agitated by friction  or by some other <a id="l209"></a>cause &amp;  rarefied by the agitation. And the friction may not rarefy <a id="l210"></a>the spirit not of all the particles in the electric body but  of those only which are on the <a id="l211"></a>outside of it: so that the action of the particles of the body upon one another for cohering &amp; pro<a id="l212"></a>ducing the above mentioned phænomena may be vastly greater then <a id="l213"></a>that of the whole electric body to attract at a sensible distance by <a id="l214"></a>friction. And if there be such an  universal electric spirit in body, certainly it must very much <a id="l215"></a>influence the  motions &amp; actions of the  particles of the bodies <a id="l216"></a> amongst one another. so that without considering it, philosophers will never be able to <a id="l217"></a>give an account of  the phænomena arising from those motions &amp; actions. <a id="l218"></a>And  so far as these phæno<a id="l219"></a>mena may be   performed by the spirit which causes electric attraction <a id="l220"></a>it is unphilosophical to look for any other cause.</p>    
<p id="par23">Quæst 25 Do not all bodies therefore abound with  <a id="l221"></a>a very subtile active  potent  elastic spirit by which light is emitted refrac<a id="l222"></a>tec &amp; reflected, electric attractions &amp; fugations are performed, &amp; the <a id="l223"></a>small particles of bodies cohere when contiguous,  agitate one another <a id="l224"></a>at small distances &amp; regulate almost all their motions amongst them<a id="l225"></a>selves. For electric – – – – uniting the thinking soul &amp; unthinking body. <a id="l226"></a>This spirit may be also of great use in vegetation, wherein three things <a id="l227"></a>are to be considered, generation, nutrition &amp; præparation of nourishment.</p>  <p id="par24">Generation is nothing else then separating a branch from the tree &amp; <a id="l228"></a>giving it better nourishment. If a separated branch takes root in the earth <a id="l229"></a> or a separated twigg or bud by grafting or inoculation  is nourished from the root <a id="l230"></a>of a young stock, it grows into a new tree as big a the tree from which it was separa<a id="l231"></a>ted being better nourished from a young root then from an old one. The seed of <a id="l232"></a>a tree  has the nature of a branch or twig or <a id="l233"></a>bud,  while it grows upon the tree it  is a part of <a id="l234"></a> the tree: but if separated &amp; set in the earth to be better nou<a id="l235"></a>rished, the embryo or young tree conteined in it takes root &amp; grows into a new tree. like manner The egg <a id="l236"></a>of a female with the embryo formed in it while it grows in the ovarium  is a  branch of the mothers body <a id="l237"></a> &amp; partakes of her life,  &amp; The embryo is as capable of  being separated from the <a id="l238"></a>mother &amp; growing great by due nourishment as a branch or twigg or budd or seed <a id="l239"></a>of a tree is of being separated from the tree &amp; growing into a new tree. For by the act of <a id="l240"></a>generation nothing more is done then to ferment the sperm of the female by the <a id="l241"></a>sperm of the male that it may thereby become fit nourishment for the Embryo. For the <a id="l242"></a>nourishment of all animals is prepared by ferment &amp; the ferment is taken from animals of the same kind ,  &amp; makes the nourishment subtile &amp; spiritual.  In adult animals the <a id="l243"></a>nourishment is fermented by the choler &amp; pancreatic juice,  both which come from the blood. The Embryo not being able to <a id="l245"></a>ferment its own nourishment  which comes from the mothers blood has it fermented by the sperm which comes from the fathers <a id="l246"></a>blood, &amp; by this nourishment  it swells, drops off from &amp; Ovarium &amp; begins to grow <a id="l247"></a>with a life distinct from that of the mother. And in Oviparous creatures if the <a id="l248"></a>sperm of the female  be not  fermented with the sperm of the male the white &amp; the yolk of the egg will <a id="l249"></a>not be fit nourishment for the Embryo. [So then  <a id="l250"></a>the Embryo grows upon the body of the mother before generation as a twig grows <a id="l251"></a>upon a tree &amp; all generation is nothing else than the preparation of due nourishments <a id="l252"></a>for the Embryo to grow with a distinct  life when separated. ]</p> 
<p id="par25">Now in all fermentation which generates spirits, the ferment abounds with a sup<a id="l253"></a>prest acid which being more attracted by the other body forsakes its own <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p235v"> &lt;235v&gt; </span> to rush upon &amp; dissolve the other &amp; by the violence of the action breaks both its <a id="l254"></a>own particles &amp; the particles of the other body into smaller particles &amp; these by their <a id="l255"></a>subtilty volatility &amp; continual digestion  resolve the whole mass into into as subtile <a id="l256"></a>parts as  it can be resolved by putrefaction. [And by this means bodies must lose their <a id="l257"></a>old form &amp; texture  &amp; be destroyed &amp; broken  into the last parts before they <a id="l258"></a>can be formed.] For as an old house must be pulled  down &amp; its stones separated <a id="l259"></a>before  a new house can be <a id="l260"></a> built out of  its materials: So natural bodies must be dissolved broken &amp; separated into <a id="l261"></a> their least parts by fermentation &amp; putrefaction &amp; lose their old form &amp; texture before  a new natural body can be formed out of them.</p>
<p id="par26">And when the  nourishment is thus prepared by dissolution &amp; subtiliation, the particles  of <a id="l263"></a>the body to be nourished draw to themselves out of the nourishment the particles of the <a id="l264"></a>same density &amp; nature with themselves. For  particles of one &amp; the same nature <a id="l265"></a>draw one another more strongly then particles of different natures do. And   therefore in the bowels of the earth  particles of the same nature are apt to assemble in the same masses &amp; those of different natures in different masses. And when <a id="l266"></a>many particles of the same kind are drawn together out of the nourishment they <a id="l267"></a>will be apt to coalesce in such  textures as the particles which drew them <a id="l268"></a>did before because they are of the same nature  as we see in the particles of salts <a id="l269"></a>which if they be of the same  kind always crystallize in the same figures. <a id="l270"></a>And  for faciliating this assimilation of the nourishment &amp; presering the nourished <a id="l271"></a>bodies from corruption it may be presumed that as electric attraction is excited <a id="l272"></a>by friction  so it may <a id="l273"></a>be invigorated also by some other causes &amp; particularly by some agitation caused in the electric spirit by the vegetable life of the <a id="l274"></a>particles of living substances: &amp; the ceasing of this vigour upon death may be the reason why the death of Animals is <a id="l275"></a>accompanied with putrefaction.</p>
<p id="par27"> </p>
<p id="par28">These things I have proposed under the heads of Quæres &amp; leave them to be <a id="l276"></a>examined.</p>

<p id="par29">by such a fermentation as generates  convenient spirits.</p>
<p id="par30">For all the use which nature makes of such fermentations  as generate spirits <a id="l277"></a>  &amp; are the beginning of putrefaction seems to be for destroying the  texture &amp; forms  of bodies &amp; breaking their particles into less parti<a id="l279"></a>cles whereby they may become subtile &amp; spiritual &amp; fit nourishment for <a id="l280"></a>things which grow. For fermentation &amp; putrefaction destroys &amp; subtilizes &amp; reduce all things <a id="l281"></a>to their least  particles &amp; nutrition recomposes those particles &amp; sets them together <a id="l282"></a>in such an order as  to make them become of the same nature with <a id="l283"></a>the things nourished.]</p>

<p id="par69"><em class="underline">Tincture</em> of Cochinell extracted with spirit of wine being powered in small quantity <a id="l422"></a>into a great mass of water, tinges the whole water because the particles of the <a id="l423"></a>Cochinell are more attracted by the water then by one another, &amp; therefore recede <a id="l424"></a>from one another.</p>
<p id="par70">Water has but a small power of attracting because it has but a small <a id="l425"></a>quantity of acid in its composition. For we call that an acid which attracts &amp; is <a id="l426"></a>attracted strongly. Whence it is that those things which dissolved in water are <a id="l427"></a>dissolved slowly &amp; without effervescence. But where  the attraction is <a id="l428"></a>strong &amp; the particles of the menstruum are  on all sided attracted by the <a id="l429"></a>particles of the metal or rather  a particle of the metall  is on all sides <a id="l430"></a>attracted by the particles of the menstruum, these agitate the particles with violence <a id="l431"></a> it &amp; carry it of from the metall, that is they corrode &amp; eat the metall <a id="l432"></a>And the same particles applied to the tongue leave the subtile earth to which they <a id="l433"></a>adhered  &amp; by a greater attraction rush into the liquids of the tongue agitate <a id="l434"></a>&amp; disjoyne its parts &amp; cause a painfull sensation by reason of which we call them <a id="l435"></a>acid.</p>
<p id="par71">In every solution made by a menstruum, the particles to be dissolved are <a id="l436"></a>more attracted by the particles of the menstruum then by one another; &amp; therefor <a id="l437"></a>leave one another to float in the menstruum.</p>

Society it appears that a cylindrical rod of glass or hard <a id="l505"></a>wax strongly rubbed emitts an electric spirit or vapour which  pushes against the hand or face so as to be felt, &amp; upon applica<a id="l507"></a>tion of the finger to the electric body crackles &amp; flashes, &amp; that the electric spirit reaches to the distance of half a foot or a foot from the glass or above &amp; <a id="l508"></a> passes readily through the solid body of a plate or vessel of glass , the electric body <a id="l509"></a>attracting things beyond  the glass; &amp; that if a globe of glass be <a id="l510"></a>nimbly turned round upon an axis &amp; in turning rub  upon a man's hand to <a id="l511"></a>excite its electric virtue, the  the hand if the glass <a id="l512"></a>be empty of air shines through the glass with a  purple light, if  <a id="l513"></a>some air be let into the glass, the whole cavity of the glass appears <a id="l514"></a>illuminated with flashes of a whiter light; if the air be let in freely <a id="l515"></a>the glass emitts an electric vapour or spirit which may be felt by the hand &amp; which <a id="l516"></a>in  dashing upon the hand or upon white paper or a handkerchief at the distance of a quarter of an inch or half an inch from <a id="l517"></a>the glass or above, illuminates the hand or paper or handkerchief with <a id="l518"></a>a white light while the glass continues in motion, the  spirit by <a id="l519"></a>striking upon those bodies being agitated so as to emit the light. <a id="l520"></a>&amp; that if some threds of cotton or worsted yorn hanging by one end at a <a id="l521"></a>little distance from one another be attracted at the other end towards the <a id="l522"></a>glass, &amp; a mans finger be advanced towards the  attracted ends of <a id="l523"></a>the threds, the threds will recede from the finger, &amp; this they will do <a id="l524"></a>as well when  they are within the glass as when they are without <a id="l525"></a>it. There is therefore an electric spirit by which bodies are in some cases <a id="l526"></a>attracted in others repelled &amp; this spirit is so subtile as to  pervade &amp; pass through the solid body of <a id="l527"></a>glass very freely in both cases, &amp; is capable of contraction &amp; dilatation <a id="l528"></a>expanding it self to great distances from the  electric body by fricti<a id="l529"></a>on, &amp; therefore is elastic &amp; susceptible of a vibrating motion like that <a id="l530"></a>of air whereby sounds are propagated, &amp; this motion is  exceeding quick so <a id="l531"></a>that the electric spirit can thereby emit light. And that which emits light in the experi<a id="l532"></a>ments above mentioned, may emitt it in all shining bodies whenever sufficiently <a id="l533"></a>agitated either by heat or by putrefaction. And the Medium which emitts light <a id="l534"></a>may also be able to refract &amp; reflect it as was noted above.  This spirit may be also the Medium by <a id="l535"></a>whose vibrating agitations  stirred up within dense bodies, the bodies receive heat  &amp; communicate it to contiguous bodies; the vibrations   being propagated from one body into another <a id="l538"></a>where the bodies are contiguous, but reflected at the surface where they are <a id="l539"></a>not contiguous &amp; by reflections kept within the hot body. The like vibrations <a id="l540"></a>may be excited in the bottom of the eye by light &amp; propagated thence  through the solid capillamenta of the optick nerves into the sensorium for causing <a id="l542"></a>vision &amp; the like of other senses. The like vibrations may be also <a id="l543"></a>propagated from the brain through the solid fibres of the spinal marrow &amp; its branches into the <a id="l544"></a>muscles for agitating &amp; expanding the liquors therein &amp; thereby contracting <a id="l545"></a>the muscles to cause the motions of animals. For  liquors are expanded <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p241r"> &lt;241r&gt; </span> by  heat  &amp; by consequence by the vibrating agitations of this <a id="l546"></a>spirit. If the agitations be of short continuance they expand the liquors <a id="l547"></a>without heating them for want of time to do it. If lasting (as in running a race, or in supporting <a id="l548"></a>a burden without external motion of the body) they heat the body by degrees &amp; at length excite sweat. This spirit therefore <a id="l549"></a> may be the medium of sense of animal motion &amp; by consequence of uniting the  thinking soul &amp; unthink<a id="l550"></a>ing body.</p>
<p id="par89">[The vegetable life may also consist in the power of this spirit supposing <a id="l551"></a>that this  power in substances which have a vegetable life  is <a id="l553"></a>stronger then in others &amp; reaches to a greater distance from the particles. <a id="l554"></a>For as the electric vertue is  invigorated by friction so it maybe by <a id="l555"></a>some other causes. And by  being stronger in the particles of living substances then in others it <a id="l556"></a>may preserve them from corruption, &amp; [ from the parti<a id="l557"></a>] act upon the nourishment to make it of like form &amp; vertue with <a id="l558"></a>the living particles as a magnet  turns iron to a magnet &amp; fire turns its nourishment to fire &amp; leaven turns past to leaven. <a id="l560"></a>For the living particles may propagate the vibrating motions of their spirit into <a id="l561"></a> the contiguous particles of the nourishment &amp; cause the spirit in those par<a id="l562"></a>ticles to vibrate &amp; act after the same manner &amp; by that action to modify the nourish<a id="l563"></a>ment after the same manner with the living particles.</p>
<p id="par90"> The life of a vegetable is in the whole vegetable &amp; in every <a id="l564"></a>part of it. For every branch &amp; every bud &amp; every seed  being duly <a id="l565"></a>nourished will grow into a new tree. And in like manner the life <a id="l566"></a>of an animal is in the whole  female &amp; in every egg of the fe<a id="l567"></a>male.  And as the branch or seed of a tree being <a id="l571"></a>separated from the tree &amp; put into the earth where it may receive <a id="l572"></a>due nourishment may grow into a new tree: so the egg of a fema<a id="l573"></a>le being separated from the  body of the female &amp; converged <a id="l574"></a>into the womb &amp; duly nourished may grow into a new animal. <a id="l575"></a>The nourishment of the seed of a plant is  putrid rain water,  This sinks into the seed, softens it &amp; sets its parts at <a id="l577"></a>liberty to exercise their vegetable life in retaining  digesting &amp; converting some part of <a id="l578"></a>the water into  their own nature. The <a id="l579"></a>nourishment of the  egg of an animal is the seed of the male &amp; fe<a id="l580"></a>male mixed &amp; fermented together in the act of generation. For all nourishment <a id="l581"></a>of animals is prepared by fermentation. That of adult animals is <a id="l582"></a>fermented by the choler &amp; pancreatic juce both which come from the <a id="l583"></a>blood. That of  an Egg or Embrio therin is the feminine sperm fermented with the <a id="l584"></a>masculine both which also come from the blood. By fermentation the nourishment is subtilized  replenished <a id="l585"></a>with spirit &amp; put into motion whereby it  acts upon the egg  swells it &amp; makes it fall off from the Ovarium <a id="l586"></a> But the egg (or Embrio therein) having a vegetable life is not corrupted by the nourish<a id="l587"></a>ment but overcomes  it &amp; digests it into its own nature &amp; grows into <a id="l588"></a>an animal. In oviparous creatures  where the white &amp; the yolk of <a id="l589"></a>the egg are the nourishment of the embrio; if the seed of the male doth not <a id="l590"></a>enter the composition of the egg the Embrio will not grow.  <a id="l591"></a>for want of due nourishment. So then generation is nothing else then <a id="l592"></a>preparation of due nourishment for making the Embrio begin to grow. <a id="l593"></a> Before generation it grew as <a id="l594"></a>a parts of the mothers body,  &amp; by growing in that manner was shaped into an Embryo ( for the <a id="l595"></a>seeds of trees have young plants in them)  by generation it receives new <a id="l596"></a>nourishment whereby it begins to grow as an animal distinct from is mother. <a id="l597"></a>&amp; the mixture of male &amp; female sperms is only for preparing this nourishment.</p>

<p id="par92">As in Mathematicks so in Natural Philosophy the investigation of difficult things  by Analy<a id="l629"></a>sis  ought ever to precede their Composition. In the <a id="l630"></a>two first Books I proceeded by Analysis to discover &amp; prove  the original differen<a id="l631"></a>ces of the rays of light in respect of  refrangibility reflexibility &amp; colour &amp; <a id="l632"></a>their alternate fits of  easy reflexion &amp; easy transmission &amp; the properties of bodies both opake &amp; pellucid on which <a id="l633"></a>their colours depend: &amp; these discoverys being proved may be assumed as Principles <a id="l634"></a>in the Method of Composition for explaining the phænomena arising from them: an instance of which Method <a id="l635"></a>I gave in the end of the first Book In this third Book I have only begun the Analysis of what remains to be discovered hinting several thing<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span><span class="nb-n">}</span></span> about light &amp; its effects upon the frame of Nature &amp; leaving the hints to be examined &amp; improved by the further experiments &amp; observations of such as are  inquisitive.. And because the knowledge of the degrees of heat may be of use in making &amp; reporting some sorts of experiments relating to this matter, I shall  add the following Question.</p>
<p id="par93"> that God [Deus O. M.] in <a id="l636"></a>penetrable moveable <a id="l637"></a> properties, &amp; in such <a id="l638"></a> for which he created them. <a id="l639"></a>And that these original particles being solids are incomparably harder then any porous <a id="l640"></a>bodies compounded of them; even so very hard as never to weare or break in pieces; <a id="l641"></a>no ordinary  power being able  to divide what God himself made one in the first <a id="l642"></a>creation. While these particles continue entire they may compound bodies of  like nature  &amp; texture in all ages; but should they weare or <a id="l644"></a>break in pieces, the nature of things depending on them would be changed. <a id="l645"></a>Water &amp; Earth composed of old worn particles &amp; fragments of particles would <a id="l646"></a>not be of the same nature &amp; texture now with water &amp; earth composed <a id="l647"></a>of entire particles in the beginning<sup>2</sup><span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 242v &gt; </span>2 It seems to me  further that these particles have not only a Vis inertiæ accompanied <a id="l648"></a>with such passive Laws of motion as naturaly result from  that force, but also that they are endued <a id="l649"></a>with certain active Principles of motion such as is that of gravity &amp; that which <a id="l650"></a>causes fermentation &amp; the cohesion of bodies. These principles I consider not <a id="l651"></a>as  occult Qualities resulting from the  specific forms of things, but as <a id="l652"></a>the general laws of Nature from whence the forms themselves result. To <a id="l653"></a>tell us that every species of things is endowed with an occult quality by which it acts <a id="l654"></a>is to tell us nothing, but to dening two or three general  Principles of motion from Phænomena &amp; afterwards to  tell us how the properties &amp; actions of all corporeal <a id="l655"></a>things follow from those  Principles would be a very great <a id="l656"></a>step in Philosophy tho the causes of those Principles were not  yet  discovered, &amp; <a id="l657"></a>therefore I sinple not to propose the Principles of force &amp; motion above mentioned.</p>
<p id="par94">Now by the  help of these Principles  all material things seem to  <a id="l658"></a>be composed of the  hard &amp; solid particles above mentioned variously associated in the first creation, but not <a id="l659"></a>without the  counsel  of an intelligent Agent. For it became <a id="l660"></a>him who created them to set them in order<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 242r resumes &gt; </span>. Of these solid particles all material things <a id="l661"></a>seem to have been composed in the first creation, but not without the inter<a id="l662"></a>vention of an intelligent Agent. For it became him who created them, to <a id="l663"></a>set them in order. And if he did so, its unphilosophical to seek for any <a id="l664"></a>other origin of the world, or to pretend that it might arise out of Chaos <a id="l665"></a>by the mere laws of nature tho being once formed it may continue  by those laws for many ages.. For while Comets move in very excentrick orbs <a id="l666"></a>in all manner of positions, blind fate could never make all the Planets move one <a id="l667"></a>&amp; the same way in orbs concentrick<sup>6</sup>. This uniformity must be allowed the effect of <a id="l668"></a>choise. And so the first contrivance of the eyes, ears, brain, heart, lungs, hands, wings,swimming <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>bodies<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; other organs of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p242v"> &lt;242v&gt; </span> sense &amp; motion in animals &amp; the  instinct of brutes &amp; insects can be the effect of nothing else  then the <a id="l669"></a>wisdome &amp; skill of a powerfull ever living Agent who being indivisibly in all places after some such manner <a id="l670"></a> as that which thinks in us is in  all parts of our sensorium, perceives all things accurately in their true solid dimensions by the immediate <a id="l671"></a>presence of the things themselves   while that which thinks in us perceives <a id="l672"></a>only the superficial pictures of things made in our sensorium by motion; &amp; who <a id="l673"></a>is more able by his will to  <a id="l674"></a> move the bodies in his sensorium  &amp; thereby to form &amp; reform the parts of the Universe then we are by  ours to move our own bodies. And since space is divisible in infinitum <a id="l675"></a>&amp; matter is not necessarily in all places, it must be also allowed that God is able to <a id="l676"></a> create  particles of matter of several sizes &amp; <a id="l677"></a>figures &amp; in several proportions to space  &amp; <a id="l678"></a>thereby to vary the Laws of Nature, &amp; make worlds of different sorts in several <a id="l679"></a>parts of the Universe.</p>
<p id="par95">The business of Experimental Philosophy is  to find out by experience &amp; <a id="l680"></a>observation not how things were created but what is the present frame of Nature. This <a id="l681"></a>enquiry should proceed  first by Analysis in arguing from things more known to things less known  &amp; particularly from effects to causes &amp; from compo<a id="l682"></a>sitions to their ingredients. And when we have found  out &amp; established any new causes or ingredients of things we may proceed <a id="l683"></a>by Synthesis from  those causes as ingredients as Principles to explain their effects &amp; compositions. Of this <a id="l684"></a>Method I gave an instance in the first book of these Opticks, investigating first by <a id="l685"></a>Analysis the
 original differences of the rays in respect of refrangibility reflexibility <a id="l686"></a>&amp; colour &amp; then from these differences  considered as principles compounding explications of the colours  <a id="l687"></a>made by Prisms, the colours of the Rainbow &amp; those of natural bodies.  Most of <a id="l688"></a>the second Book was written some years  before the First &amp; so is not in so good a <a id="l689"></a>method. However it proceeds by Analysis to discover the fits of easy reflexion &amp; <a id="l690"></a>easy transmission of the rays, &amp; from thence  the explication of the colours of <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span>les &amp; other then <a id="l691"></a>transparent plates, &amp;  those of feathers &amp; tinctures are easily compounded.. In this third Book I have only begun <a id="l692"></a>the Analysis of what remains to be discovered about light, hinting several things about its <a id="l693"></a>nature &amp; effects &amp; leaving the hints to be examined  &amp; improved by  the <a id="l694"></a>further experiments &amp; observations of such as are curious, till some further Principles shall be  <a id="l695"></a>established  &amp; the explication of their effects compounded. And by pursuing this method till we <a id="l696"></a>come to as clear &amp; full a knowledge of the first cause as we can expect from Phænomena, Natural Philoso<a id="l697"></a>phy will be perfected, &amp; a good foundation will be laid for enlarging the bounds <a id="l698"></a>of Moral Philosophy. Fo</p>

<p id="par96">All bodies seem to be composed of hard particles. for otherwise fluids would not <a id="l699"></a>congeale as water, Byles, vinegre &amp; spirit or oyle of Vitriol,  do by freezing, Mercury by <a id="l700"></a>fumes of Lead,  Spirit of Nitre &amp;  Mercury by dissolving the Mercury &amp; evaporating the flegm, spirit of wine &amp; Spirit of Urin by mixing &amp; spirit of Urin &amp; spirit <a id="l701"></a>of salt by  subliming to  make salarmoniac. Even the rays of light  seem to be hard <a id="l702"></a>bodies for otherwise they would not retain different properties in their different sides. <a id="l703"></a>And thefefore hardness may be recconed the property of all uncompounded matter. I <a id="l704"></a>say uncompounded  because compounded matter may be soft or fluid by the sliding <a id="l705"></a> of the  hard particles amongst one another. But as for uncompounded matter there seems <a id="l706"></a>to be the same evidence of its hardness as of its impenetrability:  <a id="l707"></a>For we account  matter impenetrable only  because we find it so by experience in all bodies in which we can try experiments.  And if compound bodies  are so very hard as we find <a id="l710"></a>many of them to be &amp; yet  are very porous &amp; consist of parts which are only layed <a id="l711"></a>together, the simple bodies which are void of pores &amp; were never yet divided,  <a id="l712"></a>must be much harder. Now such hard bodies being heaped up together can  scarce touch <a id="l713"></a>one another  in more then points. And how bodies which touch only <a id="l714"></a>in points can stick together  without the assistance of something  which causes them to be attracted or prest towards one another is very difficult to conceive.</p>
<p id="par97">And by pursuing this method in other things as well as in light we may hope  to discover more &amp; more of the <a id="l716"></a>causes   of things &amp; to put the discoveries out of dispute till we come to as clear &amp; full a knowledge of the very first cause <a id="l717"></a>as we can expect from phænomena. And thereby we shal not only perfect Natural Philosophy but also  <a id="l718"></a>enlarge the bounds of Moral Philosophy,  establishing upon the clear light of Nature the worship of <a id="l719"></a>a Deity as well as the love of our Neighbour.</p>
<p id="par98">All these things being considered, it seems to me that  Deus O. M. in the <a id="l720"></a>beginning ) created  matter  (consisting of hard  solid  impenetrable moveable &amp; <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span>  particles of such  sizes &amp; figures &amp; with such  <a id="l721"></a>other properties &amp; in such proportion to space as most conduced to the ends for which he <a id="l722"></a>created them. That these particles are so very hard as never to weare or break in <a id="l723"></a>pieces,   no ordinary power being able to divide what  the power of God himself  made one in the fir creation.  While these particles continue entire they wil be  <a id="l724"></a>fit to compound bodies of one &amp; the same nature &amp; texture in all ages, but should they weare <a id="l725"></a>or break in pieces the nature of things depending on them would be changed. Water &amp; <a id="l726"></a>Earth  composed  of  old worn particles &amp;  fragments of particles <a id="l727"></a>would not be  of the same  nature &amp; texture now with water &amp; earth composed of entire particles in the beginning. <a id="l729"></a>Of these particles all material things seem to have been composed in the  first creation but not <a id="l730"></a>without the intervention of an intelligent Agent. For it became him that created them to set them in order . And if he did so, its unphilosophical to seek for any other origin of the world or to pretend that it  might arise out of a  Chaos by the mere laws of Nature.  For while Comets move in <a id="l731"></a>very excentrick Orbs  in all manner of positions, blind fate could never <a id="l732"></a>make  all the Planets move one &amp; the same way in orbs concentric. This uniformity must be allowed <a id="l733"></a> the effect of choise.

And when we have found the principles [the causes  &amp;  ingredients of things we may proceed by <a id="l743"></a> Synthesis  from those Principles to explain the things of this method I gave instances in the two first books.  <a id="l744"></a>proceeding first by Resolution &amp; then by composition But  in this third Book I have only begun the Analysis of what remains to be  discovered,  hinting several things here about the nature of light &amp; its effects upon the frame of <a id="l746"></a>Nature, &amp; leaving the hints to be examined &amp; improved by the further experiments &amp; observations of <a id="l747"></a>such as are curious.  And because the knowledge of the degrees of heat may <a id="l748"></a> be of use in making &amp; reporting  some sorts of Experiments  relating to this matter I  <a id="l749"></a>shal conclude with the following Question.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p243v"> &lt;243v&gt; </span>
<p id="par99">The air in which we breath resists about 10000 times less then quicksilver &amp;if   <a id="l750"></a>the  resistance in a glass well emptied of air should be but two hundred times less then <a id="l751"></a>that of the open air it would be two millions of times less then that of quicksilver. And in the <a id="l752"></a>heavens it would be still much less, there being exp of rarefying airs above  8000 times. And <a id="l753"></a>therefore the Vis inertiæ  of the matter in the heavens is much above  2000000 of times <a id="l754"></a>less than that of quicksilver. </p>

For We have the whole course of a large experience for the universal <a id="l769"></a>gravity  of matter &amp; for the hardness of its particles without any instance to the contrary &amp; we have <a id="l770"></a>nothing more  for its universal impenetrability. These particles being solid seem to be so very hard as <a id="l771"></a> never to wear or break in pieces no ordinary power being able to divide what the  power of God himself made one in the first creation.

<p id="par103" class="i0">so that the resistance seems still to decrease in the same proportion with the density of <a id="l774"></a>the  resisting fluid.

But it <a id="l782"></a>seems to be  much less in such a vessel  &amp; still much less in the heavens above the orb of the Moon. For M<sup>r</sup> Boyle <a id="l783"></a>has shewed that Air may be rarefied eight or ten thousand times &amp;  the heavens <a id="l784"></a>   are much emptier of air then any vacuum we can <a id="l785"></a>make below [&amp;  therefore have much less resistance  then any such vacuum,  &amp; by consequence,  are very much above a million of times rarer &amp; emptier of matter then <a id="l787"></a>quicksilver.] For since the air is comprest by the weight of the incumbent atmosphere &amp; the density of air is proportional to the force compressing it <a id="l788"></a>it follows by computation that at the height of seven miles from the earth the <a id="l789"></a> air is  twice rarer then at the surface of the earth &amp; at the hight of 14 miles <a id="l790"></a>it is  four times rarer then at the surface of the earth &amp; at the height of 21, 28, <a id="l791"></a>35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70 miles it is 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512,  1024  <a id="l792"></a>times rarer of thereabouts &amp; at the height of 140, 210, 280,  <a id="l793"></a>miles it is about 1000000, 1000000000, 1000000000000 times rarer &amp; so on</p>

<p id="par108">This will be best understood by the following Table</p>
<p id="par109">For sulphureous steams ascend frequently out of the bowels of the earth &amp; the Air abound <a id="l800"></a>with  acids fit to promote fermentation as may be peceived by the rusting of iron &amp; copper in it &amp; by the kindling of <a id="l801"></a>fire with a pair of Bellows, &amp; by the dependence of the beating of the heart upon respira<a id="l802"></a>tion.</p>

For the air abounds with  acid vapors <a id="l813"></a> fit to promote fermentations , as appears by the rusting of iron  copper in it &amp; the  kindling of fire  by blowing &amp; by the dependence of the beating of the heart upon respiration. </p>
<p id="par113">[‡ Now  the above mentioned motions are  so great &amp; violent   as to shew that in fermentations there is <a id="l816"></a>new motion in the world generated from other Principles then the usual laws of <a id="l817"></a>motion.] Now the above mentioned motions are so great &amp; violent as to <a id="l818"></a>shew that in fermentations bodies which almost rest are put into new motions by a  very potent  Principle  which acts upon  them only when they approach one another,  [&amp; <a id="l822"></a>which is much more potent then are the  passive laws of motion <a id="l823"></a>arising from the Vis inertiæ of the matter.]</p>

<p id="par115">I have hitherto proceeded in this Book by way of Analysis, arguing from effects to causes <a id="l836"></a>&amp; from compound bodies to their ingredients. In the  first Book I proceeded first by <a id="l837"></a>Analysis in searching into the different refrangibility of the rays &amp; the corresponding <a id="l838"></a>colours of light &amp; then from those Principles compounded the explications of the <a id="l839"></a>colours of light refracted by Prisms those of the Rainbow &amp; those of Natural bodies.

To compass this <a id="l851"></a>is a work which requires many heads &amp; hands &amp; a long time &amp; yet this ought to <a id="l852"></a>be done before we proceed from the first Principles by Composition to explain <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>all<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l853"></a>Nature.</p>

Such a wonderfull uniformity  in the Planetary Systeme <a id="l856"></a>must be allowed the effect of choise.

<p id="par118">This Analysis consists in arguing from   from compositions to ingredients,  &amp; from motions to the forces producing them &amp; in general <a id="l866"></a>from phænomena to their causes, &amp; from  particular causes to more general ones <a id="l867"></a>till to  argument end in the most general.

And if Natural Philosophy in all its parts by pursuing this method <a id="l870"></a> shall at length be perfected, the bounds of Moral Philosophy will be also <a id="l871"></a>enlarged  <a id="l872"></a>For  so far as we  can know by Natural Philosophy what  power the first cause has over us &amp; what <a id="l873"></a>benefits we  receive  or may expect from him, so far our duty towards him as well as that towards one <a id="l874"></a>another will  appear to us by the  light of nature. And no doubt, if the worship of <a id="l875"></a>fals Gods had not blinded the Heathens, their Moral Philosophy would have gone further <a id="l876"></a>then to the four Cardinal Vertues, &amp; instead of teaching us to worship the Sun &amp; Moon <a id="l877"></a>&amp; dead mens Souls, they would that tought us  to worship  our  true Benefactor</p>
<p id="par119">These  forces are to be  considered here not as occult Qualities which arise from the specific forms of things <a id="l878"></a>but as general Principles by which the things themselves are formed;  their truth appearing <a id="l881"></a>to us Phænomena,, tho their causes be not yet explained.</p>

And for these reasons the density of fluid Me<a id="l923"></a>diums is very nearly proportional to their resistance. Liquors which differ <a id="l924"></a>not much in density, as water, spirit of vine, spirit of turpentine, hot oyle, <a id="l925"></a>differ not much in resistance. Water is thirteen or fourteen times lighter <a id="l926"></a>then quicksilver &amp; by consequence 13 or 14 times rarer, &amp; its resistance is less <a id="l927"></a>then that of quicksilver in the same proportion or thereabouts, as I have found by <a id="l928"></a>experiments made with Pendulums. The open Air in which we breath is eight or <a id="l929"></a>nine hundred times lighter then water, &amp; by consequence eight or nine hundred <a id="l930"></a>times rarer, &amp; accordingly its resistance is less then that of water in the <a id="l931"></a>same proportion or thereabouts, as I have also  found by experiments made with <a id="l932"></a>pendulums; &amp; in thinner Air the resistance is still less &amp; at length by rarefying <a id="l933"></a>the Air becomes insensible. For small feathers falling in the open air meet with great <a id="l934"></a>resistance but in a tall glass well emptied of air they fall as fast as lead or <a id="l935"></a>gold as I have seen tried several times.  Whence the <a id="l937"></a>resistance seems still to decrease in proportion to the density of the fluid. For I do <a id="l938"></a>not find by any experiments that bodies moving in Quicksilver Water or Air <a id="l939"></a>meet with any other sensible resistance then what arizes from the density <a id="l940"></a>&amp; tenacity of those sensible fluids as they would do if the pores of those fluids &amp; all other spaces were pervaded by a more subtile resisting fluid.. Now if the resistence in a vessel well <a id="l941"></a>emptied of Air was but an hundred times less then in the open Air it <a id="l942"></a>would be about a million of times less then in quicksilver. But it seems to be much <a id="l943"></a>less in such a vessel &amp; still much less in the heavens at the height of three or four <a id="l944"></a>hundred miles from the earth or above. For M<sup>r</sup> Boyle has shewed that Air may be <a id="l945"></a>rarified above ten thousand times in vessels of glass; &amp; the heavens are much emp<a id="l946"></a>tier of air then any vacuum we can make below. For since the Air is comprest <a id="l947"></a>by the weight of the incumbent atmosphere &amp; the density of Air is proportional <a id="l948"></a>to the force compressing it, it follows by computation that at the height of about seven <a id="l949"></a>miles from the earth the air is  four times rarer then at the surface of the earth, <a id="l950"></a>&amp; at the height of 14 miles it is  sixteen times rarer then at the surface of the <a id="l951"></a>earth; &amp; at the height of 21, 28, or 35,  miles it is respectively 6<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>4<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>, 256, or 1024,  times rarer or thereabouts; &amp; at the height of 70, 140, or 210,   <a id="l953"></a>miles it is about 1000000,  1000000000000 or 1000000000000000000 times rarer, &amp; so on.</p>
<p id="par133">Heat promotes fluidity very much by diminishing the tenacity of bodies.

For otherwise the acid would not do the office of a medium between <a id="l1243"></a>the earth &amp; common water for making salts dissolvable in the water <a id="l1244"></a>nor would salt of tartar readily draw off the acid from dissolved metalls. <a id="l1245"></a>nor metals the acid from Mercury. Now as in the great globe of the earth &amp; sea the densest bodies by gra<a id="l1246"></a>vity sink down in water &amp; always endeavour to go towards the center of <a id="l1247"></a>the globe so in particles of salt the densest matter will always endeavour <a id="l1248"></a>to approach the center of the particle: so that a particle of salt may <a id="l1249"></a>be compared to a chaos, being dense hard dry &amp; earthy in the center &amp; <a id="l1250"></a> rare soft moist &amp; watry in the circumference.

<p id="par157"> Some other Principle was necessary for putting bodies into motion, &amp; now they are in motion some other Principle is necessary for conserving the motion. <a id="l1430"></a> For from the various composition of two motions tis very certain that there is <a id="l1431"></a>not always the same quantity of motion in the world. For if two globes joyned <a id="l1432"></a>by a slender rod revolve about their common center of gravity with an uniform <a id="l1433"></a>motion while that center moves on uniformly in a right line drawn in the  plane <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p255r"> &lt;255r&gt; </span> of their circular motion, the summ of the motions of the two globes as often <a id="l1434"></a>as the globes are in the right line  described by their common <a id="l1435"></a>center of gravity will be bigger then the summ of their motions <a id="l1436"></a>when they are in a line perpendicular to that right line. By this instance it appears that motion may be got or lost; but <a id="l1437"></a>by reason of the tenacity of fluids &amp; attrition of their parts &amp; <a id="l1438"></a>the weakness of elasticity in solids, motion is much more apt to be lost <a id="l1439"></a>then got, &amp; is always upon the decay. For bodies which are either so <a id="l1440"></a>absolutely hard or so soft as to be void of elasticity, will not rebound <a id="l1441"></a>from one another. Impenetrability makes them only stop. If two <a id="l1442"></a>equal bodies meet directly in vacuo they will be the laws of <a id="l1443"></a>motion stop where they meet  &amp; lose all their motion &amp; continue to <a id="l1444"></a>rest, unless they be elastick &amp; receive new motion  from their spring. <a id="l1445"></a>If they have so much elasticity as suffices to make them rebound <a id="l1446"></a>with  a quarter or half or three quarters of the force with which they came together they will  <a id="l1447"></a> lose three quarters or half or a <a id="l1449"></a>quarter of their motion. And this may be tried  by letting two equal pendu<a id="l1450"></a>lums  fall  against one another <a id="l1451"></a>from equal heights. If the pendulums be of lead or soft clay they will lose all or almost all their motion: if of elastic bodies, they will lose all but what they recover from their elasticity. If three equal round vessels be filled the one <a id="l1452"></a>with water the other with oyle the third with molten pitch &amp; the <a id="l1453"></a>liquors be stirred about alike to give them a vortical motion: the <a id="l1454"></a>pitch by its tenacity will lose its motion quickly, the oyle being less <a id="l1455"></a>tenacious will keep it longer &amp; the water being least tenacious will <a id="l1456"></a>keep it longest but yet will lose it in a short time. Whence <a id="l1457"></a>its easy to understand that if many contiguous Vortices of molten pitch were <a id="l1458"></a>each of them as large as the Cartesian, yet these &amp; all their parts <a id="l1459"></a>would by their tenacity &amp; stifness communicate their motion to <a id="l1460"></a>one another till they all rested among themselves. Vortices of oyle <a id="l1461"></a>or water or some fluider matter might continue longer in motion <a id="l1462"></a>but unless the matter were void of all tenacity &amp; attrition of <a id="l1463"></a>parts &amp; communication of motion (which is not to be supposed) the <a id="l1464"></a>motion would constantly decay. Seing therefore the variety of <a id="l1465"></a>motion which we see in the world is always decreasing, there is a necessity <a id="l1466"></a>of conserving &amp; recruiting it by active principles; such as are <a id="l1467"></a> the cause of gravity by which  Planets &amp; Comets keep their motions in their Orbs &amp; all bodies <a id="l1470"></a>acquire great motion in falling; &amp; the cause of fermentation by <a id="l1471"></a>which the heart &amp; blood of animals are kept in perpetual motion <a id="l1472"></a>&amp; heat,  the inward parts of the earth are constantly warmed <a id="l1473"></a>bodies burn &amp; shine, mountains take fire, the caverns of the earth are blown up &amp; the Sun continues violently hot &amp; lucid <a id="l1474"></a>&amp; warms all things by his light. <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p256r"> &lt;256r&gt; </span> .

<p id="par159">Qu. 21. Are not the rays of light very small bodies emitted from shining substances &amp; refracted by mean <a id="l1488"></a>of certain attractions which intercede them &amp; the parts of pellucid bodies. <a id="l1489"></a>For such bodies will pass through uniform Mediums in right lines without <a id="l1490"></a>bending into the shadow, which is the  nature of the rays of light.  They will also  be capable of several properties &amp; be able to conserve their properties unchanged <a id="l1492"></a> in passing through several Mediums, which is another <a id="l1493"></a>condition of the rays of light. Pellucid substances act upon the rays <a id="l1494"></a>of light at a distance in refracting reflecting &amp; inflecting them &amp; <a id="l1495"></a>the rays mutualy agitate the parts of those substances at a distance <a id="l1496"></a>for heating them; &amp; this action &amp; reaction at a distance very much resembles an attra<a id="l1497"></a>ctive force. If refraction be performed by attraction of the rays, the <a id="l1498"></a>sines of incidence must be to the sines of refraction in a given proportion <a id="l1499"></a>as we shewed in our Principles of Philosophy, &amp; this Rule is true by  <a id="l1500"></a>experience.  The rays of light in going out of glass into a Vacuum are bent towards the glass, and if they fall too <a id="l1501"></a>obliquely on the Vacuum they are bent backwards into the glass &amp; totaly reflected,  &amp; this reflexion <a id="l1502"></a>cannot be ascribed to the resistance of the Vacuum, but must be caused <a id="l1503"></a>by the power of the glass attracting the rays at their going out of  it <a id="l1504"></a> into the Vacuum &amp; bringing them back.  For if the <a id="l1505"></a>further surface of the glass be moistened with water or clear oyle or liquid &amp; clear honey, <a id="l1506"></a>the rays  which would otherwise be reflected will go into the water oyle or honey, &amp; therefore <a id="l1507"></a>are  not reflected  before they arrive at the further surface of the glass <a id="l1508"></a> &amp; begin to go out  of it. If they go out of it into water <a id="l1509"></a> oyle or honey they go on,  because the attraction of the glass  is almost ballan<a id="l1510"></a>ced &amp; rendred ineffectual by the contrary attraction of the  liquor; <a id="l1511"></a>but if they go out of  it into a vacuum which has no attraction to ballance <a id="l1512"></a>that of the glass, the attraction of the glass either bends &amp; refracts them <a id="l1513"></a>or brings them back &amp; reflects them. ✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 257br &gt; </span>✝And this is still more evident by  laying together two Prisms  of Glass or two Object glasses of <a id="l1515"></a>very long Telescopes the one plane the other a little convex,  &amp; so compressing them that they do not <a id="l1516"></a>fully touch  nor are too far asunder.

<p id="par160">Qu. 22. Are not gross bodies &amp; light convertible into one another: &amp; may not <a id="l1562"></a>bodies receive their activity from the  particles of light which enter their <a id="l1563"></a>composition? For all fixt bodies being heated emit light so long as they con<a id="l1564"></a>tinue sufficiently hot, &amp; light mutualy stops in bodies as often as its <a id="l1565"></a>rays strike upon their parts, as we shewed above. I know no body less <a id="l1566"></a>apt to shine then water, &amp; yet water by frequent destillations changes <a id="l1567"></a>into fixed earth  as M<sup>r</sup> Boyle has tried &amp; then this earth being enabled to endure a sufficient heat shines  by heat  like other <a id="l1568"></a>bodies. The changing of  bodies into light &amp; light into bodies is very <a id="l1569"></a>conformable to the course of nature, which seems delighted with transmutations <a id="l1570"></a>Water, which is a very fluid volatile tastless salt, she changes by heat into <a id="l1571"></a>vapour which is a sort of air, &amp; by cold into ice which is a hard pellucid <a id="l1572"></a>brittle fusible stone: &amp; this stone returns into water by heat &amp; vapour <a id="l1573"></a>returns into water by cold. Earth by heat becomes fire &amp; by cold re<a id="l1574"></a>turns into Earth. Dense bodies by fermentation rarefy into several <a id="l1575"></a>sorts of air &amp; this air by fermentation &amp; sometimes without it returns <a id="l1576"></a>into dense bodies. Mercury appears sometimes in the form of  a fluid metal, sometimes in the form of a hard brittle <a id="l1578"></a>metal, sometimes in the form of a corrosive pellucid salt called sublimate, <a id="l1579"></a>sometimes in the form of a tastless pellucid volatile white earth called <a id="l1580"></a>Mercurius dulcis, or in that of a red opake volatile earth called Cin<a id="l1581"></a>naber, or in that of a red or white precipitate, or in that of a fluid <a id="l1582"></a>salt, &amp; In destillation it turns into vapour. &amp; Being agitated in vacuo it shines <a id="l1583"></a>like fire.  And after all these  changes it returns again into Mercury. Eggs grow from insensible magnitudes &amp; change into animals, Tad-poles into Frogs &amp; worms into Flyes. All Birds Beasts &amp; Fishes <a id="l1586"></a>Insects Trees &amp; other Vegetables with their several parts, grow out of <a id="l1587"></a>water &amp; watry tinctures &amp; salts, &amp; by putrefaction return again into <a id="l1588"></a>watry substances. And  water standing a few days in the open air yeilds <a id="l1589"></a>a tincture which (like that of Mault) by standing longer yeilds a sediment <a id="l1590"></a>&amp; a spirit, but before putrefaction is fit nourishment for animals &amp; <a id="l1591"></a>vegetables. And among such various &amp; strange transmutations why may not <a id="l1592"></a>Nature change bodies into light &amp; light into bodies?</p>
<p id="par161">Now  in bodies of the same kind &amp; vertue attraction is strongest <a id="l1593"></a>in the smallest bodies in proportion to their bulk. It is found stronger in small <a id="l1594"></a>magnets for their weight then in great ones. For the parts of small ones being <a id="l1595"></a>closer together unite their forces more easily. And therefore since the rays of <a id="l1596"></a>light are the smallest bodies known to us we may expect to find their attractions <a id="l1597"></a>very strong. And how strong they are may be gathered by this  Rule. The <a id="l1598"></a>attraction of a ray of light in proportion to the  quantity of its matter is to the gravity of a <a id="l1599"></a>projectile in proportion to  the quantity of its matter in a compound ratio of the velocity of the <a id="l1600"></a>ray of light to the velocity of the projectile twice &amp; of the bent or curvity of the <a id="l1601"></a>ray in the place of refraction to the bent or curvity of the line described <a id="l1602"></a>by the projectile supposing the inclination of the ray to the  <a id="l1603"></a>refracting surface &amp; that of the projectile to the horizon to be alike. <a id="l1604"></a>And by this proportion I reccon the attraction of the rays of light to be above <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p260r"> &lt;260r&gt; </span> ten hundred thousand thousand millions of times greater then the weight of bodies <a id="l1605"></a>on the surface of this earth in proportion to the matter in them, supposing <a id="l1606"></a>that light comes from the sun to us in about seven or eight minutes of  an hour. <a id="l1607"></a>And in immediate contact of the rays their force may be still much greater. And so great a force in the rays cannot but have a very great effect upon the <a id="l1608"></a>particles of matter with which they are compounded for causing the particles to <a id="l1609"></a>attract one another &amp; for putting them in motion amongst  <a id="l1610"></a>themselves: for the better understanding of which I will propose the <a id="l1611"></a>following Quæstion.</p>

<p id="par162">Qu. 17.

For if the <a id="l1627"></a>rays endeavour to recede from the densest part of the vibration they <a id="l1628"></a>may be alternately accelerated &amp; retarded by the vibrations overtak<a id="l1629"></a>ing them.</p>

<p id="par165">Qu. 20.

For if this Medium be rarer <a id="l1669"></a>within the Sun's body then at its surface, &amp; rarer there then at the distance <a id="l1670"></a>of the hundredth part of any inch from its body, &amp; rarer there than at the tenth part of an inch from its body, &amp; rarer there then at the orb of Saturn: <a id="l1671"></a>I see no reason why the increase of density should stop any where &amp; not <a id="l1672"></a>rather be continued through all distances from the Sun to Saturn, &amp; be<a id="l1673"></a>yond. And tho this increase of density may at great distances be exceeding slow <a id="l1674"></a>yet if the elastick force of this Medium be exceeding great, it may suffice <a id="l1675"></a>to impell bodies from the denser parts of the Medium towards the rarer with <a id="l1676"></a>all that power which we call gravity. And that the elastick force of this <a id="l1677"></a>Medium is exceeding great, may be gathered from the swiftness of its <a id="l1678"></a>vibrations. Sounds move about 1140 English feet in a second minute of <a id="l1679"></a>time, &amp; in seven or eight minutes of time they move about one hundred <a id="l1680"></a>English miles. Light moves from the Sun to us in about seven or eight <a id="l1681"></a>minutes of time, which distance is about 70000000 English miles, supposing <a id="l1682"></a>the horizontal Parallax of the Sun to be about 12″. And the vibrations <a id="l1683"></a>or pulses of this Medium, that they may cause the alternate fits of easy transmissi<a id="l1684"></a>on &amp; easy reflexion, must be swifter then light, &amp; by consequence above <a id="l1685"></a>700000 times swifter than sounds. And therefore the elastick force of <a id="l1686"></a>this Medium  in proportion to its density must be above <a id="l1687"></a>700000 x 700000 times greater then the elastic force of the Air is in <a id="l1688"></a>proportion to its density. For in elastic Mediums of equal density, the elasticity  must be <a id="l1689"></a>in a duplicate ratio of the velocity of the pulses. And if the density be increased or diminished &amp; the elasticity  be increased or diminished in the same proportion,  the velocity will remain the same <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the middle of f 261v &gt; </span>&amp;  if the elasticity &amp; density be <a id="l1690"></a>encreased or decreased in one &amp; the same proportion the velocity will re<a id="l1691"></a>main the same.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 262r resumes &gt; </span></p>

<p id="par175">Qu. 17.

<p id="par176">Qu. 18. If in two large tall cylindricall vessels of glass <a id="l1744"></a>inverted, two little Thermometers be  suspended so as not to <a id="l1745"></a>touch the vessels, &amp; the Aer be drawn out of one of these vessels, &amp; <a id="l1746"></a>these vessels thus prepared be carried out of a cold place into a <a id="l1747"></a>warm one: the Thermometer in vacuo will grow warm as much <a id="l1748"></a>&amp; almost as soon as the Thermometer which is not in vacuo.

Is not the heat of the warm room conveyed through <a id="l1752"></a>the Vacuum by the vibrations of a much subtiler Medium then <a id="l1753"></a>Air, which after the Air was drawn out remained in the Vacuum? <a id="l1754"></a>And is not this Medium the same with that Medium by which light <a id="l1755"></a>is refracted &amp; reflected, &amp; by whose vibrations light communicates <a id="l1756"></a>heat to bodies, &amp; is put into fits of easy reflexion &amp; easy transmissi<a id="l1757"></a>on?

<p id="par177">Qu. 19. Doth not the refraction of light proceed from the different <a id="l1764"></a>density of this æthereal Medium in different places, the light receding <a id="l1765"></a>always from the denser parts of the Medium? And is not the density <a id="l1766"></a>thereof greater in free &amp; open spaces void of Air &amp; other grosser bodies <a id="l1767"></a>then within the pores of water glass crystal gemms &amp; other compact bodies? <a id="l1768"></a>For when light passes through glass or crystal &amp; falling very  <a id="l1769"></a>obliquely upon the further surface thereof is totally reflected, the total <a id="l1770"></a>reflexion ought to proceed rather from the density &amp; vigour of the Medium <a id="l1771"></a>without &amp; beyond the glass, than from the rarity &amp; weakness thereof.</p>
<p id="par178">Qu. 20.

<p id="par179">Qu. 21. Is not this Medium much rarer within the dense bodies of the Sun <a id="l1777"></a>Stars Planets &amp; Comets then in the empty celestial spaces between them, &amp; in passing <a id="l1778"></a>from them to great distances doth it not grow denser &amp; denser perpetually &amp; <a id="l1779"></a>thereby cause the gravity of those great bodies towards one another, &amp; of <a id="l1780"></a>their parts towards the bodies; every body endeavouring to go from the <a id="l1781"></a>denser parts of the Medium towards the rarer? For if this Medium be <a id="l1782"></a>rarer  within the Sun's body then at its surface, &amp; rarer there <a id="l1783"></a>then at the hundredth part of an inch from its body, &amp; rarer there then <a id="l1784"></a>at the fiftith part of an inch from its body, &amp; rarer there then at the <a id="l1785"></a>Orb of Saturn: I see no reason why the increase of density should stop any<a id="l1786"></a>where &amp; not rather be continued through all distances from the Sun to Sa<a id="l1787"></a>turn &amp; beyond. And tho this increase of density may at great distances be <a id="l1788"></a>exceeding slow, yet if the elastick force of this Medium be exceeding <a id="l1789"></a>great, it may suffice to impell  bodies from the denser parts of the <a id="l1790"></a>Medium towards the rarer with all that power which we call gravity. <a id="l1791"></a>And that the elastick force of this Medium is exceeding great may be gathered <a id="l1792"></a>from the swiftness of its vibrations. Sounds move about 1140 English feet <a id="l1793"></a>in a second  minute of time, &amp; in seven or eight minutes of time they <a id="l1794"></a>move about one hundred English miles. Light moves from the sun to us in <a id="l1795"></a>about seven or eight minutes of time, which distance is about 70000000 <a id="l1796"></a>English miles, supposing the horizontal Parallax of the Sun to be about <a id="l1797"></a>12″. And the vibrations or pulses of this Medium, that they may cause the <a id="l1798"></a>alternate fits of easy transmission &amp; easy reflexion, must be swifter then <a id="l1799"></a>light, &amp; by consequence above 700000 times swifter then sounds. And <a id="l1800"></a>therefore the elastick force of this Medium in proportion to its density must <a id="l1801"></a>be above 700000 x 700000 times greater then the elastick force of the <a id="l1802"></a>Air is in proportion to its density.

<p id="par181">As attraction is stronger in small magnets then in great ones in <a id="l1814"></a>proportion to their bulk, &amp; gravity is greater in the surfaces of <a id="l1815"></a>small planets then in those of great ones in proportion ot their <a id="l1816"></a>bulk, &amp; small bodies are agitated much more by electric attraction then <a id="l1817"></a>great ones: so the smallness of the rays of light may contribute very <a id="l1818"></a>much to the power of the agent by which they are refracted.

And may not <a id="l1831"></a>its resistance be so small as to be inconsiderable? For instance. If <a id="l1832"></a>this Æther (for so I will call it) should be supposed 700000 times more <a id="l1833"></a>elastic then our Air &amp; above 700000 times more rare; its resistance would <a id="l1834"></a>be above 600000000 times less then that of water.

<p id="par185">Qu. 25. Are there not other original properties of the rays of <a id="l1856"></a>light besides those already described? An instance of another original <a id="l1857"></a>property we have in the refraction of Island Crystal described first by <a id="l1858"></a>Erasmus Bartholine &amp; afterwards more exactly by Hugenius in his <a id="l1859"></a>Book De la lumiere. This crystal is a pellucid fissile stone clear as <a id="l1860"></a>water or crystal of the rock, &amp; without colour; enduring a red heat <a id="l1861"></a>without loosing it's transparency, &amp; in a very strong heat calcining <a id="l1862"></a>without fusion. Steeped a day or two in water it looses its natural <a id="l1863"></a> polish. Being rubbed on cloth it attracts pieces of straws <a id="l1864"></a>&amp; other light things like Ambar or Glass: &amp; with Aqua fortis it makes <a id="l1865"></a>an ebullition. It seems to be a sort of Talk &amp; is found in form of an <a id="l1866"></a>oblique Parallelopiped [with six parallelogram sides &amp; eight solid <a id="l1867"></a>angles. The obtuse angles of the Parallelogramms are each of them <a id="l1868"></a>101 degrees &amp; 52 minutes; the acute ones 78 degrees &amp; 8 minutes. <a id="l1869"></a>Two of the solid angles opposite to one another, as C &amp; E, are compassed <a id="l1870"></a>each of them with three of these obtuse angles, &amp; each of the other <a id="l1871"></a>six with one obtuse &amp; two acute ones. It cleaves easily in planes <a id="l1872"></a>parallel to any of its sides, &amp; not in any other planes. It cleaves <a id="l1873"></a>with a glossy polite surface not perfectly plane but with some little <a id="l1874"></a>uneavenness. It is easily scratcht, &amp; by reason of it's softness it takes <a id="l1875"></a>a polish very difficultly. It polishes better upon polished looking-glass <a id="l1876"></a>then upon metal, &amp; perhaps better upon pitch leather or parchment. <a id="l1877"></a>Afterwards it must be rubbed with a little oyle or white of an egg to <a id="l1878"></a>fill up its scratches: whereby it will become very transparent &amp; polite. But <a id="l1879"></a>for several experiments, it is not necessary to polish it. If a piece of this <a id="l1880"></a>crystalline stone be laid upon a book, every letter of the Book seen <a id="l1881"></a>through it will appear double by means of a double refraction. And if <a id="l1882"></a>any beam of light falls either perpendicularly or in any oblique angle <a id="l1883"></a>upon any surface of this crystal, it becomes divided into two beams by <a id="l1884"></a>means of the same double refraction. Which beams are of the same <a id="l1885"></a>colour with the incident beam of light, &amp; seem equal to one another <a id="l1886"></a>in the quantity of their light, or very nearly equal. One of these re<a id="l1887"></a>fractions is performed by the usual Rule of Opticks, the sine of Incidence <a id="l1888"></a>out of Air into this Crystal being to the sine of Refraction, as five to three. The other Refraction, <a id="l1889"></a>which may be called the unusual Refraction, is performed by the <a id="l1890"></a>following Rule.</p>
<p id="par186">Let ADBC represent the refracting surface of the crystall, C the <a id="l1891"></a>biggest solid angle at that surface, GCHF the opposite surface, &amp; <a id="l1892"></a>CK a perpendicular on that surface. This perpendicular makes with <a id="l1893"></a>the edge of the crystal CF an angle of 19<sup>degr.</sup> 3′. Ioyne KF &amp; in it <a id="l1894"></a>take KL so that the angle  KCL be 6<sup>degr.</sup> 40′, &amp; the angle LCF <a id="l1895"></a>12<sup>degr.</sup> 28′. And if ST represent any beam of light incident at T in <a id="l1896"></a>any angle upon the refracting surface ADBC, let TV be the refracted <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p266r"> &lt;266r&gt; </span> beam determined by the given proportion of the sines 5 to 3 according <a id="l1897"></a>to the usual rule of Opticks. Draw VX parallel &amp; equal to KL. Draw <a id="l1898"></a>it the same way from V in which L lieth from K; &amp; joyning TX, this <a id="l1899"></a>line TX shall be the other refracted beam carried from T to X by the <a id="l1900"></a>unusual refraction.</p>
<p id="par187">If therefore the incident beam ST be perpendicular to the refracting <a id="l1901"></a>surface, the two beams TV &amp; TX into which it shall become divided, shall <a id="l1902"></a>be parallel to the lines CK &amp; CL; one of those beams going through the <a id="l1903"></a>crystall perpendicularly as it ought to do by the usual laws of Opticks, &amp; the <a id="l1904"></a>other TX by an unusual refraction diverging from the perpendicular &amp; <a id="l1905"></a>making with it an angle VTX of about 6<span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1" style="width: 0.712em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.709em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.353em, 1000.71em, 3.058em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-3"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 0.474em; height: 0px; margin-right: 0.12em; margin-left: 0.12em;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.32em, 4.188em, -1000em); top: -4.426em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-4" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">2</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.331em, 1000.32em, 4.204em, -1000em); top: -3.594em; left: 50%; margin-left: -0.177em;"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-5" style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Main;">3</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(0.822em, 1000.47em, 1.289em, -1000em); top: -1.315em; left: 0em;"><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: 0em; border-top: 1.3px solid; width: 0.474em; height: 0px;"></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 1.095em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.467em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.404em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-1"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math></script> degrees, as is found by <a id="l1906"></a>experience. And hence the plane VTX &amp; such like planes which are <a id="l1907"></a>parallel to the plane CFK, may be called the planes of perpendicular <a id="l1908"></a>refraction. And the coast towards which the lines KL &amp; VX are drawn, <a id="l1909"></a>may be called the coast of unusual refraction.</p>
<p id="par188">In like manner Crystal of the rock has a double refraction: but the <a id="l1910"></a>difference of the two refractions is not so great &amp; manifest as in Island <a id="l1911"></a>crystall.</p>
<p id="par189">When the beam ST incident on Island Crystal, is divided into two <a id="l1912"></a>beams TV &amp; TX, &amp; these two beams arrive at the further surface <a id="l1913"></a>of the glass; the beam TV which was refracted at the first surface <a id="l1914"></a>after the usual manner, shall be again refracted entirely after the <a id="l1915"></a>usual manner at the second surface; &amp; the beam TX which was <a id="l1916"></a>refracted after the unusual manner in the first surface shall be <a id="l1917"></a>again refracted entirely after the unusual manner in the second surface: so <a id="l1918"></a>that both these beams shall emerge out of the second surface in lines <a id="l1919"></a>parallel to the first incident beam ST.</p>
<p id="par190">And if two pieces of Island Crystall be placed one after another <a id="l1920"></a>in such manner that all the surfaces of the latter be parallel to all <a id="l1921"></a>the corresponding surfaces of the former: the rays which are refracted <a id="l1922"></a>after the usual manner in the first surface of the first crystall shall <a id="l1923"></a>be refracted after the usual manner in all the following surfaces: &amp; the <a id="l1924"></a>rays which are refracted after the unusual manner in the first <a id="l1925"></a>surface shall be refracted after the unusual manner in all the following <a id="l1926"></a>surfaces. And the same thing happens tho the surfaces of the crystalls be <a id="l1927"></a>any ways inclined to one another, provided that their planes of perpendi<a id="l1928"></a>cular refraction be parallel to  one another.</p>
<p id="par191">And therefore there is an original difference in the rays of light by <a id="l1929"></a>means of which some rays are in this Experiment constantly refracted <a id="l1930"></a>after the usual manner, &amp; others constantly after the unusual manner <a id="l1931"></a>For if the difference be not original but arises from new modifications <a id="l1932"></a>imprest on the rays at their first refraction it would be altered by new <a id="l1933"></a>modifications in the three following refractions: whereas it suffers no <a id="l1934"></a>alteration but is constant &amp; has the same effect upon the rays in all the <a id="l1935"></a>refractions. The unusual refraction is therefore performed by an ori<a id="l1936"></a>ginal property of the rays. And it remains to be enquired whether the <a id="l1937"></a>rays have not more original properties then are yet discovered.</p>
<p id="par192">Qu. 26. Have not the rays of light several sides endued with <a id="l1938"></a>several original properties? For if the planes of perpendicular refracti<a id="l1939"></a>on of the second crystall, be at right angles with the planes of perpen<a id="l1940"></a>dicular refraction of the first crystall: the rays which are refracted after <a id="l1941"></a>the usual manner in passing through the first crystall will be all of them <a id="l1942"></a>refracted after the unusual manner in passing through the second crystall; <a id="l1943"></a>&amp; the rays which are refracted after the unusual manner in passing <a id="l1944"></a>through the first crystall will be all of them refracted after the usual <a id="l1945"></a>manner in passing through the second crystall. And therefore there are <a id="l1946"></a>not two sorts of rays differing in their nature from one another, one <a id="l1947"></a>of which is constantly &amp; in all positions refracted after the usual <a id="l1948"></a>manner, &amp; the other constantly &amp; in all positions after the unusual <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p267r"> &lt;267r&gt; </span> manner. The difference between the two sorts of rays in the Experiment <a id="l1949"></a>mentioned in the 25<sup>th</sup> Question, was only in the positions of the sides <a id="l1950"></a>of the rays to the planes of perpendicular refraction. For one &amp; the same <a id="l1951"></a>ray is here refracted sometimes after the usual &amp; sometimes after the <a id="l1952"></a>unusual manner according to the position which its sides have to the <a id="l1953"></a>crystalls. If the sides of the rays are posited the same way to both <a id="l1954"></a>crystalls, it is refracted after the same manner in them both: but <a id="l1955"></a>if that side of the ray which looks towards the coast of the unusual <a id="l1956"></a>refraction of the first crystall be 90 degrees from that side of the <a id="l1957"></a>same ray which looks towards the coast of the unusual refraction <a id="l1958"></a>of the second crystall, (which may be effected by varying the position <a id="l1959"></a>of the second crystall to the first, &amp; by consequence to the rays of light <a id="l1960"></a>the ray shall be refracted after several manners in the several <a id="l1961"></a>crystalls. There is nothing more required to determin whether the <a id="l1962"></a>rays of light which fall upon the second crystall shall be refracted <a id="l1963"></a>after the usual or after the unusual manner, but to turn about <a id="l1964"></a>this crystal so that the coast of this crystalls unusuall refraction <a id="l1965"></a>may be on this or on that side of the ray. And therefore every ray <a id="l1966"></a>may be considered as having four sides or quarters, two of which <a id="l1967"></a>opposite to one another incline the ray to be refracted after the un<a id="l1968"></a>usual manner as often as either of them are turned towards the <a id="l1969"></a>coast of unusual refraction, &amp; the other two whenever either of them <a id="l1970"></a>are turned towards the coast of unusual refraction, do not incline it <a id="l1971"></a>to be otherwise refracted then after the usual manner. The two <a id="l1972"></a>first may therefore be called the sides of unusual refraction. And <a id="l1973"></a>since these dispositions were in the rays before their incidence on the <a id="l1974"></a>second third &amp; fourth surfaces of the two crystalls, &amp; suffered no alter<a id="l1975"></a>ation (so far as appears) by the refraction of the rays in  <a id="l1976"></a>their passage through those surfaces, &amp; the rays were refracted by <a id="l1977"></a>the same laws in all the four surfaces; it appears that those disposi<a id="l1978"></a>tions were in the rays originally, &amp; suffered no alteration by the first <a id="l1979"></a>refraction, &amp; that by means of those dispositions the rays were refracted <a id="l1980"></a>at their incidence on the first surface of the first crystal, some of <a id="l1981"></a>them after the usual &amp; some of them after the unusual manner, <a id="l1982"></a>accordingly as their sides of  unusual refraction were then <a id="l1983"></a>turned towards the coast of the unusual refraction of that crystal or <a id="l1984"></a>sideways from it.</p>
<p id="par193">Every ray of light has therefore two opposite sides originally <a id="l1985"></a>endued with a property on which the unusual refraction depends, &amp; <a id="l1986"></a>other two opposite sides not endued with that property. And it remains <a id="l1987"></a>to be enquired whether there are not more properties of light by which <a id="l1988"></a>the sides of the rays differ &amp; are distinguished from one another.</p>
<p id="par194">In explaining the difference of the sides of the rays above menti<a id="l1989"></a>oned, I have supposed that the rays fall perpendicularly on the first <a id="l1990"></a>crystall. But if they fall obliquely on it, the success is the same. <a id="l1991"></a>Those rays which are refracted after the usual manner in the first <a id="l1992"></a>crystall will be refracted after the unusual manner in the second <a id="l1993"></a>crystall; supposing the planes of perpendicular refraction to be at <a id="l1994"></a>right angles with one another as above: &amp; on the contrary.</p>
<p id="par195">If the planes of the perpendicular refraction of the two <a id="l1995"></a>crystalls be neither parallel nor perpendicular to one another but <a id="l1996"></a>contein an acute angle: the two beams of light which emerge out of <a id="l1997"></a>the first crystall, will be each of them divided into two more at <a id="l1998"></a>their incidence on the second crystall. For in this case the rays <a id="l1999"></a>in each of the two beams will some of them have their sides of <a id="l2000"></a>unusual refraction &amp; some of them their other sides turned towards <a id="l2001"></a>the coast of the unusual refraction of the second crystall.</p>
<p id="par196">Qu. 27. Are not all Hypotheses erroneous which have hitherto <a id="l2002"></a>been invented for explaining the phenomena of light by new modi<a id="l2003"></a><span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p268r"> &lt;268r&gt; </span>fications of the rays? For those phenomena depend not upon new modi<a id="l2004"></a>fications as has been supposed, but upon the original &amp; unchangeable <a id="l2005"></a>properties of the rays.</p>
<p id="par197">Qu. 28. Are not all Hypotheses erroneous in which light is <a id="l2006"></a>supposed to consist in pression or motion propagated through a fluid <a id="l2007"></a>Medium? For in all these Hypotheses the phænomena of light have <a id="l2008"></a>been hitherto explained by supposing that they arise from new modifica<a id="l2009"></a>tions of the rays: which is an erroneous supposition.</p>
<p id="par198">If light consisted only in pression propagated without actual motion <a id="l2010"></a>it would not be able to agitate &amp; heat the bodies which refract &amp; reflect it. <a id="l2011"></a>If it consisted in motion propagated to all distances in an instant it would <a id="l2012"></a>require an infinite force every moment in every [shining particle to <a id="l2013"></a>generate that motion. And if it consisted in pression or motion propagated <a id="l2014"></a>either in an instant or in time it would bend into the shadow. For pression <a id="l2015"></a>or motion cannot be propagated in a fluid in right lines beyond an obstacle <a id="l2016"></a>which stops part of the motion, but will bend &amp; spread every way into <a id="l2017"></a>the quiescent Medium which lyes beyond the obstacle. Gravity tends <a id="l2018"></a>downwards, but the pressure of water arising from Gravity tends <a id="l2019"></a>every way with equal force &amp; is propagated as readily &amp; with as much <a id="l2020"></a>force sideways as downwards &amp; through crooked passages as through <a id="l2021"></a>streight ones. The waves on the surface of stagnating water,  passing <a id="l2022"></a>by the sides of a broad obstacle which stops part of them, bend afterwards <a id="l2023"></a>&amp; dilate themselves gradually into the quiet water behind the obstacle. <a id="l2024"></a>The waves, pulses or vibrations of the Aer wherein sounds consist, bend <a id="l2025"></a>manifestly tho not so much as the waves of water. For a Bell or a <a id="l2026"></a>Canon may be heard beyond a hill which intercepts the sight of the <a id="l2027"></a>sounding body, &amp; sounds are propagated as readily through crooked pipes <a id="l2028"></a>as through streight ones. But light is never known to follow crooked <a id="l2029"></a>passages nor to bend into the shadow. For the fixt stars by the interpo<a id="l2030"></a>sition of any of the Planets cease to be seen. And so do the parts of the <a id="l2031"></a>Sun by the interposition of the Moon, Mercury or Venus. The rays which <a id="l2032"></a>pass very neare to the edges of any body are bent a little by the action <a id="l2033"></a>of the body, as we shewed above, but this bending is not towards but <a id="l2034"></a>from the shadow, &amp; is performed only in the passage of the ray by the <a id="l2035"></a>body &amp; at a very small distance from it. So soon as the ray is past <a id="l2036"></a>the body, it goes right on.</p>
<p id="par199">To explain the unusual refraction of Island Crystal by pression or <a id="l2037"></a>motion propagated has not hitherto been attempted (to my knowledge) <a id="l2038"></a>except by Huygens who for that end supposed two several vibrating <a id="l2039"></a>Mediums within that Crystall. But when he tryed the refractions in <a id="l2040"></a>two successive pieces of that crystall, &amp; found them such as is mentioned <a id="l2041"></a>above: he confessed himself at a loss for explaining them. For pressions <a id="l2042"></a>or motions propagated from a shining body through an uniform Medium <a id="l2043"></a>must be on all sides alike: whereas by those experiments it appears <a id="l2044"></a>that the rays of light have different properties in their different sides. <a id="l2045"></a>He suspected that the pulses of Æther in passing through the first crystall <a id="l2046"></a>might receive certain new modifications which might determin them to <a id="l2047"></a>be propagated in this or that Medium within the second crystal according <a id="l2048"></a>to the position of that crystall. <sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> But what <a id="l2049"></a>modifications those might be he could not <a id="l2050"></a>say, nor think of any thing satisfactory in <a id="l2051"></a>that point. And if he had known that the <a id="l2052"></a>unusual refraction depends not on new modifications <a id="l2053"></a>but on the original &amp; unchangeable dispositions of the rays, he would have <a id="l2054"></a>found it as difficult to explain how those dispositions which he supposed to be <a id="l2055"></a>imprest on the rays by the first crystall, could be in them before their <a id="l2056"></a>incidence on that crystall; &amp; in general, how all rays emitted by shining <a id="l2057"></a>bodies, can have those dispositions in them from the beginning. To me at least <a id="l2058"></a>this seems inexplicable if light be nothing else then pression or motion propagated <a id="l2059"></a>through Æther. </p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p269r"> &lt;269r&gt; </span>
<p id="par200">And it is as difficult to explain by these Hypotheses how rays can be <a id="l2060"></a>alternately in fits of easy reflexion &amp; easy transmission; unless perhaps <a id="l2061"></a>one might suppose that there are in all space two ethereal vibrating <a id="l2062"></a>Mediums, &amp; that the vibrations of one of them constitute light, &amp; <a id="l2063"></a>the vibrations of the other are swifter, &amp; as often as they overtake <a id="l2064"></a>the vibrations of the first, put them into those fits. But how two <a id="l2065"></a>æthers can be diffused through all space, one of which acts upon the <a id="l2066"></a>other &amp; by consequence is reacted upon, without retarding shattering <a id="l2067"></a>dispersing &amp; confounding one anothers motions is inconceivable. And <a id="l2068"></a>against filling the heavens with fluid Mediums unless they be exceed<a id="l2069"></a>ing rare, a great objection arises from the regular &amp; very lasting <a id="l2070"></a>motions of the Planets &amp; Comets in all manner of courses through the <a id="l2071"></a>heavens. For thence it is manifest that the heavens are voyd of all <a id="l2072"></a>sensible resistance &amp; by consequence of all sensible matter.</p>
<p id="par201">For the resisting power of fluid Mediums arises partly from the <a id="l2073"></a>attrition of the parts of the Medium &amp; partly from the vis inertiæ of <a id="l2074"></a>the matter. That part of the resistance of a spherical body which <a id="l2075"></a>arises from the attrition of the parts of the Medium is very nearely <a id="l2076"></a>as the diameter, or, at the most, as the factum of the diameter &amp; the velocity of the <a id="l2077"></a>spherical body together. And that part of the resistance which arises from <a id="l2078"></a>the vis inertiæ of the matter is as the square of that factum.  And by this difference the two sorts of resistance <a id="l2080"></a>may be distinguished from one another in any Medium; &amp; these being <a id="l2081"></a>distinguished, it will be found that almost all the resistance of bodies of <a id="l2082"></a>a competent magnitude moving in Aer, Water,  Quicksilver, &amp; such <a id="l2083"></a>like fluids with a competent velocity, arises from the Vis Inertiæ of <a id="l2084"></a>the parts of the fluid</p>
<p id="par202">Now that part of the resisting power of any Medium which <a id="l2085"></a>arises from the tenacity friction or attrition of the parts of the Me<a id="l2086"></a>dium may be diminished by dividing the matter into smaller parts &amp; mak<a id="l2087"></a>ing the parts more smooth &amp; slipery: but that part of the resistance <a id="l2088"></a>which arises from the vis inertiæ, is proportional to the density of the <a id="l2089"></a>matter &amp; cannot be diminished by dividing the matter into smaller parts <a id="l2090"></a>nor by any other means then by decreasing the density of the Medium. <a id="l2091"></a>And for these reasons the density of fluid Mediums is very nearely <a id="l2092"></a>proportional to their resistance. Liquors which differ not much in <a id="l2093"></a>density as water, spirit of wine, spirit of Turpentine, hot oyle, differ <a id="l2094"></a>not much in resistance. Water is thirteen or fourteen times lighter then <a id="l2095"></a>Quicksilver, &amp; by consequence thirteen or fourteen times rarer, &amp; its <a id="l2096"></a>resistance is less then that of quicksilver in the same proportion or <a id="l2097"></a>thereabouts, as I have found by experiments made with Pendulums. The <a id="l2098"></a>open Air in which we breath is eight or nine hundred times lighter then <a id="l2099"></a>water &amp; by consequence eight or nine hundred times rarer, &amp; according<a id="l2100"></a>ly its resistance is less then that of water in the same proportion or there<a id="l2101"></a>abouts; as I have also found by experiments made with Pendulums. And in <a id="l2102"></a>thinner Air the resistance is sitll less, &amp; at length, by rarefying the Air, <a id="l2103"></a>becomes insensible. For small feathers falling in the open Air meet <a id="l2104"></a>with great resistance, but in a tall glass well emptied of Air they fall as <a id="l2105"></a>fast as lead or gold, as I have seen tried several times. Whence the <a id="l2106"></a>resistance seems still to decrease in proportion to the density of the <a id="l2107"></a>fluid. For I do not find by any experiments that bodies moving in Quick<a id="l2108"></a>silver, Water or Air, meet with any other sensible resistance then what <a id="l2109"></a>arises from the density &amp; tenacity of those sensible fluids, as they would <a id="l2110"></a>do if the pores of those fluids &amp; all other spaces were filled with a dense <a id="l2111"></a>&amp; subtile fluid. Now if the resistance in a vessel well emptied of Air, was <a id="l2112"></a>but an hundred times less then in the open Air, it would be about a million <a id="l2113"></a>of times less then in quicksilver. But it seems to be much less in such a <a id="l2114"></a>vessel, &amp; still much less in the heavens at the height of three or four hundred <a id="l2115"></a>miles from the earth or above. For M<sup>r</sup> Boyle has shewed that Air may be <a id="l2116"></a>rarefied above ten thousand times in vessels of glass: &amp; the heavens are much <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p270r"> &lt;270r&gt; </span> emptier of Air then any vacuum we can make below. For since the Air <a id="l2117"></a>is comprest by the weight of the incumbent atmosphere, &amp; the density of Air <a id="l2118"></a>is proportional to the force compressing it, it follows by computation that <a id="l2119"></a>at the height of about seven English miles from the Earth the aer is <a id="l2120"></a>four times rarer then at the surface of the Earth, &amp; at the height of <a id="l2121"></a>14 miles it is sixteen times rarer then at the surface of the earth, &amp; <a id="l2122"></a>at the height of 21, 28, or 35 miles it is respectively 64, 256 or 1024 <a id="l2123"></a>times rarer or thereabouts; &amp; at the height of 70, 140 or 210 miles <a id="l2124"></a>it is about 1000000, 1000000000000 or 1000000000000000000 times <a id="l2125"></a>rarer; &amp; so on.</p>
<p id="par203">Heat promotes fluidity very much by diminishing the tenacity of bodies. <a id="l2126"></a>It makes many bodies fluid which are not fluid in cold, &amp; increases the fluidity <a id="l2127"></a>of tenacious liquids as of Oyle Balsam &amp; Honey, &amp; thereby decreases their <a id="l2128"></a>resistance. But it decreases not the resistance of water considerably as it <a id="l2129"></a>would do if any considerable part of the resistance of water arose from the <a id="l2130"></a>attrition or tenacity of its parts. And therefore the resistance of water arises <a id="l2131"></a>principally &amp; almost entirely from the Vis inertiæ of its matter; &amp; by conse<a id="l2132"></a>quence, if the heavens were as dense as  water they <a id="l2133"></a>would not have much less resistance then water; if as dense as quicksilver <a id="l2134"></a>they would not have much less resistance then quicksilver; if absolutely dense <a id="l2135"></a>or full of matter without any vacuum, let the matter be never so subtile &amp; <a id="l2136"></a>fluid, they would have a greater resistance then quicksilver. A solid globe <a id="l2137"></a>in such a Medium would lose above half its motion in moving three times the <a id="l2138"></a>length of its diameter, &amp; a globe not solid (such as are the Planets) would <a id="l2139"></a>be retarded sooner. And therefore to make  way for the regular &amp; <a id="l2140"></a>lasting motions of the Planets &amp; Comets, its necessary to empty the heavens <a id="l2141"></a>of all matter, except perhaps some very thin vapors steams or effluvia <a id="l2142"></a>arising from the Atmospheres of the Earth, Planets &amp; Comets, &amp; such an <a id="l2143"></a>exceedingly rare æthereal Medium as we described above. A dense fluid <a id="l2144"></a>can be of no use for explaining the Phænomena of nature, the motions <a id="l2145"></a>of the Planets &amp; Comets being better explained without it. It serves only <a id="l2146"></a>to disturb &amp; retard the motions of those great bodies &amp; make the frame <a id="l2147"></a>of nature languish: &amp; in the pores of bodies, it serves only stop the vibra<a id="l2148"></a>ting motions of their parts wherein their heat &amp; activity consists. And as <a id="l2149"></a>it is of no use &amp; hinders the operations of nature &amp; makes her languish, so <a id="l2150"></a>there is no evidence for its existence, &amp; therefore it ought to be rejected. <a id="l2151"></a>And if it be rejected, the Hypotheses that light consists in pression or motion <a id="l2152"></a>propagated through such a Medium, are rejected with it.</p>
<p id="par204">And for rejecting such a Medium we have the authority of those the <a id="l2153"></a>oldest &amp; most celebrated Philosophers of Greece &amp; Phenicia who made a <a id="l2154"></a>Vacuum &amp; Atoms &amp; the gravity of Atoms the first Principles of their <a id="l2155"></a>Philosophy; tacitely attributing gravity to some other cause then dense <a id="l2156"></a>matter. Later Philosophers banish the consideration of such a cause out of <a id="l2157"></a>Natural Philosophy, feigning Hypotheses for explaining all things mecha<a id="l2158"></a>nically &amp; referring other causes to Metaphysicks: whereas the main <a id="l2159"></a>business of natural Philosophy is to argue from Phænomena without <a id="l2160"></a>feigning Hypotheses, &amp; to deduce causes from effects till we come to the <a id="l2161"></a>very first cause, which certainly is not mechanical; &amp; not only to unfold <a id="l2162"></a>the mechanism of the world but chiefly to resolve these &amp; such like <a id="l2163"></a>questions. What is there in places almost empty of matter, &amp; whence <a id="l2164"></a>is it that the Sun &amp; Planets gravitate towards one another without <a id="l2165"></a>dense matter between them? Whence is it that Nature doth nothing in <a id="l2166"></a>vain, &amp; whence arises all that order &amp; beauty which we see in the <a id="l2167"></a>world? To what end are Comets, &amp; whence is it that Planets move all <a id="l2168"></a>one &amp; the same way in Orbs concentric, while Comets move all manner <a id="l2169"></a>of ways in Orbs very excentric, &amp; what hinders the fixt stars from <a id="l2170"></a>falling upon one another? How came the bodies of animals to be con<a id="l2171"></a>trived with so much art, &amp; for what ends were there several parts? <a id="l2172"></a>Was the eye contrived without skill in Opticks, &amp; the ear without know<a id="l2173"></a>ledge of sounds? How do the motions of the body follow from the will, &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p271r"> &lt;271r&gt; </span> whence is the instinct in animals? Is not the sensory of animals that <a id="l2174"></a>place to which the  sensitive substance is present, &amp; into which the <a id="l2175"></a>sensible species of things are carried through the nerves &amp; brain that <a id="l2176"></a>there they may be perceived by their immediate presence to that sub<a id="l2177"></a>stance? And these things being rightly dispatcht, does it not appear <a id="l2178"></a>from phænomena that there is  a Being incorporeal, living, intelli<a id="l2179"></a>gent, omnipresent, who in infinite space, as it were in his sensory, sees <a id="l2180"></a>the things themselves intimately, &amp; throughly perceives them &amp; compre<a id="l2181"></a>hends them wholy by their immediate presence to himself: of which <a id="l2182"></a>things the images only carried through the organs of sense into our little <a id="l2183"></a>sensoriums, are there seen &amp; beheld by that which in us perceives &amp; <a id="l2184"></a>thinks. And tho every true step made in this Philosophy brings us not imme<a id="l2185"></a>diately to the knowledge of the first cause, yet it brings us nearer to it, &amp; on <a id="l2186"></a>that account is to be highly valued.</p>
<p id="par205">Qu. 29. Are not the rays of light very small bodies emitted from <a id="l2187"></a>shining substances? For such bodies will pass through uniform mediums in <a id="l2188"></a>right lines without bending into the shadow, which is the nature of the rays of <a id="l2189"></a>light. They will also be capable of several properties &amp; be able to conserve <a id="l2190"></a>their properties unchanged in passing through several Mediums, which is <a id="l2191"></a>another condition of the rays of light. Pellucid substances act upon the <a id="l2192"></a>rays of light at a distance in refracting reflecting &amp; inflecting them, &amp; the <a id="l2193"></a>rays mutually agitate the parts of those substance  at a <a id="l2194"></a>distance for heating them; &amp; this action &amp; reaction at a distance very <a id="l2195"></a>much resembles an attractive force between bodies. if refraction be per<a id="l2196"></a>formed by attraction of the rays, the sines of incidence must be to the sines <a id="l2197"></a>of refraction in a given proportion, as we shewed in our Principles of Philo<a id="l2198"></a>sophy; &amp; this Rule is true by experience. The rays of light in going <a id="l2199"></a>out of glass into a Vacuum, are bent towards the glass, &amp; if they fall too <a id="l2200"></a>obliquely on the vacuum they are bent backwards into the glass &amp; totaly <a id="l2201"></a>reflected; &amp; this reflexion cannot be ascribed to the resistance of an <a id="l2202"></a>absolute Vacuum, but must be caused by the power of the glass attracting <a id="l2203"></a>the rays at their going out of it into the Vacuum &amp; bringing them back. <a id="l2204"></a>For if the further surface of the glass be moistened with water or <a id="l2205"></a>clear oyle or liquid &amp; clear honey: the rays which would otherwise be <a id="l2206"></a> reflected will go into the water oyle or honey, &amp; therefore <a id="l2207"></a>are not reflected before they arrive at the further surface of the <a id="l2208"></a>glass &amp; begin to go out of it. If they go out of it into the water oyle <a id="l2209"></a>or honey, they go on, because the attraction of the glass is almost <a id="l2210"></a>ballanced &amp; rendred ineffectual by the contrary attraction of the liquor. <a id="l2211"></a>But if they go out of it into a Vacuum which has no attraction to <a id="l2212"></a>ballance that of the glass, the attraction of the glass either  <a id="l2213"></a>bends &amp; refracts them, or brings them back &amp; reflects them. And this <a id="l2214"></a>is still more evident by laying together two Prisms of glass, or two Object-glasses <a id="l2215"></a>of very long Telescopes, the one plane the other a little convex, &amp; so com<a id="l2216"></a>pressing them that they do not fully touch nor are too far asunder. For <a id="l2217"></a>the light which falls upon the further surface of the first glass where the <a id="l2218"></a>interval between the glasses is not above the ten [hundred thousandth <a id="l2219"></a>part of an inch, will go through that surface, &amp; through the air or <a id="l2220"></a>vacuum between the glasses, &amp; enter into the second glass, as was ex<a id="l2221"></a>plained in the first fourth &amp; eighth Observations of the first Part of <a id="l2222"></a>the second Book. But if the second glass be taken away, the light <a id="l2223"></a>which goes out of the second surface of the first glass into the Air <a id="l2224"></a>or Vacuum, will not go on forwards but turns back into the first glass <a id="l2225"></a>&amp; is reflected; &amp; therefore it is drawn back by the power of the first <a id="l2226"></a>glass, there being nothing else to turn it back. Nothing more is <a id="l2227"></a>requisite for the producing all the variety of colours &amp; degrees of refrangi<a id="l2228"></a>bility then that the rays of light be bodies of different sizes, the least <a id="l2229"></a>of which may make violet the weakest &amp; darkest of the colours, &amp; be <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p272r"> &lt;272r&gt; </span> more easily diverted by refracting surfaces from the right course; &amp; <a id="l2230"></a>the rest as they are bigger &amp; bigger, may make the stronger &amp; more <a id="l2231"></a>lucid colours, blue, green, yellow, &amp; red, &amp; be more &amp; more difficultly <a id="l2232"></a>diverted. Nothing more is requisite for putting the rays of light into <a id="l2233"></a>fits of easy reflexion &amp; easy transmission, then that they be small bodies <a id="l2234"></a>which by their attractive powers or some other force, stir up vibrations <a id="l2235"></a>in what they act upon, which vibrations being swifter then the rays, <a id="l2236"></a>overtake them successively, &amp; agitate them so as by turns to increase &amp; <a id="l2237"></a>decrease their velocities &amp; thereby put them into those fits. And lastly <a id="l2238"></a>the unusual refraction of Island Crystal looks very much as if it were <a id="l2239"></a>performed by some kind of attractive vertue lodged in certain sides <a id="l2240"></a>both of the rays &amp; of the particles of the crystal. For were it not for <a id="l2241"></a>some kind of disposition or vertue lodged in some sides of the particles <a id="l2242"></a>of the crystall &amp; not in their other sides, &amp; which inclines &amp; bends the <a id="l2243"></a>rays towards the coast of unusual refraction; the rays which fall <a id="l2244"></a>perpendicularly on the crystall, would not be refracted towards that <a id="l2245"></a>coast rather then towards any other coast, both at their incidence &amp; <a id="l2246"></a>at their emergence, so as to emerge perpendicularly by a contrary <a id="l2247"></a>situation of the coast of unusual refraction at the second surface; <a id="l2248"></a>the crystall acting upon the rays after they have past through it &amp; are <a id="l2249"></a>emerging into the Air, or, if you please, into a Vacuum. And since the <a id="l2250"></a>crystall by this disposition or vertue does not act upon the rays unless <a id="l2251"></a>when one of their sides of unusual refraction looks towards that coast, <a id="l2252"></a>this argues a vertue or disposition in those sides of the rays, which <a id="l2253"></a>answers to &amp; sympathizes with that vertue or disposition of the crystall <a id="l2254"></a>as the poles of two magnets answer to one another. And as magnetism <a id="l2255"></a>may be intended &amp; remitted, &amp; is found only in the Magnet &amp; in iron: <a id="l2256"></a>so this vertue of refracting the perpendicular rays is greater in <a id="l2257"></a>Island Crystall, less in Crystall of the rock, &amp; is not yet found in other <a id="l2258"></a>bodies. I do not say that this vertue is magnetical. It seems to be of <a id="l2259"></a>another kind. I only say that what ever it be, it's difficult to con<a id="l2260"></a>ceive how the rays of light unless they be bodies, can have a permanent <a id="l2261"></a>vertue in two of their sides which is not in their other sides, &amp; this with<a id="l2262"></a>out any regard to their position to the space or Medium through which <a id="l2263"></a>they pass.</p>
<p id="par206">What I mean in this Question by a Vacuum &amp; by the attractions of the rays <a id="l2264"></a>of light towards glass or crystall may be understood by what was said in the 18<sup>th</sup> <a id="l2265"></a>19<sup>th</sup> &amp; 20<sup>th</sup> Questions.</p>
<p id="par207">Qu. 30. Are not gross bodies &amp; light convertible into one another, &amp; may <a id="l2266"></a>not bodies receive much of their activity from  the particles of light which <a id="l2267"></a>enter their composition? For all fixt bodies being heated emit light so long <a id="l2268"></a>as they continue sufficiently hot, &amp; light mutually stops in bodies as often <a id="l2269"></a>as its rays strike upon their parts, as we shewed above. I know no body <a id="l2270"></a>less apt to shine then water; &amp; yet water by frequent destillations <a id="l2271"></a>changes into fixed earth, as M<sup>r</sup> Boyle has tried, &amp; then this earth being <a id="l2272"></a>enabled to endure a sufficient heat, shines by heat like other bodies.</p>
<p id="par208">The changing of bodies into light &amp; light into bodies is very con<a id="l2273"></a>formable to the course of nature, which seems delighted with transmuta<a id="l2274"></a>tions. Water which is a very fluid volatile tastless salt, she changes by <a id="l2275"></a>heat into vapour which is a sort of air, &amp; by cold into ice which is a hard <a id="l2276"></a>pellucid brittle fusible stone: &amp; this stone returns into water by heat <a id="l2277"></a>&amp; vapour returns into  water by cold. Earth by heat becomes <a id="l2278"></a>fire &amp; by cold returns into earth. Dense bodies by fermentation rarefy <a id="l2279"></a>into several sorts of air, &amp; this air by fermentation &amp; sometimes <a id="l2280"></a>without it; returns into dense [bodies. Mercury appears sometimes in <a id="l2281"></a>the form of a fluid metall, sometimes in the form of a hard brittle <a id="l2282"></a>metall; sometimes in the form of a corrosive pellucid salt called sublimate, <a id="l2283"></a>sometimes in the form of a tastless pellucid volatile white earth called <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p273r"> &lt;273r&gt; </span> <em class="underline">Mercurius dulcis</em>, or in that of a red opake volatile earth called Cinnaber, <a id="l2284"></a>or in that of a red or white Precipitate, or in that of a fluid salt; &amp; in <a id="l2285"></a>destillation it turns into vapour, &amp; beign agitated in Vacuo it shines like <a id="l2286"></a>fire. And after all these changes it returns again into its first form of <a id="l2287"></a>Mercury. Eggs grow from insensible magnitudes &amp; change into animals, <a id="l2288"></a>Tadpoles into Froggs, &amp; Worms into flyes. All Birds Beasts &amp; Fishes, Insects <a id="l2289"></a>Trees &amp; other Vegetables with their several parts, grow out of water &amp; <a id="l2290"></a>watry  tinctures &amp; salts, &amp; by putrefaction return again into <a id="l2291"></a>watry substances. And water standing a few days in the open air, yeilds <a id="l2292"></a>a tincture, which (like that of Mault) by standing longer yeilds a sediment <a id="l2293"></a>&amp; a spirit, but before putrefaction is fit nourishment for animals &amp; vege<a id="l2294"></a>tables. And among such various &amp; strange transmutations, why may not <a id="l2295"></a>nature change bodies into light &amp; light into bodies?</p>
<p id="par209">Qu. 31. Have not the small particles of bodies certain powers <a id="l2296"></a>virtues or forces by which they act at a distance, not only upon the rays <a id="l2297"></a>of light for reflecting refracting &amp; inflecting them, but also upon one <a id="l2298"></a>another for producing a great part of the phænomena of nature? For <a id="l2299"></a>its well known that bodies act one upon another by the attractions of gravity <a id="l2300"></a> magnetism &amp; electricity, &amp; these instances shew the <a id="l2301"></a>tenour &amp; course of nature, &amp; make it not improbable  but that <a id="l2302"></a>there may be more attractive powers then these. For Nature is very <a id="l2303"></a>consonant &amp; conformable to her self. How these attractions may be perform<a id="l2304"></a>ed I do not here consider. What I call attraction may be performed by <a id="l2305"></a>impulse or by some other means unknown to me. I use that word here <a id="l2306"></a>to signify only in general any force by which bodies tend towards one <a id="l2307"></a>another whatsoever be the cause. For we must learn from the phæno<a id="l2308"></a>mena of nature what bodies attract one another, &amp; what are the laws <a id="l2309"></a>&amp; properties of the attraction, before we enquire the cause by which <a id="l2310"></a>the attraction is performed. The attractions of gravity magnetism &amp; <a id="l2311"></a>electricity reach to very sensible distances, &amp; so have been observed <a id="l2312"></a>by vulgar eyes, &amp; there may be others which reach to so small <a id="l2313"></a>distances as hitherto escape observation, &amp; perhaps electrical attra<a id="l2314"></a>ction may reach to such small distances even without being excited <a id="l2315"></a>by friction.</p>
<p id="par210">For when salt of Tartar runs per deliquium, is not this done <a id="l2316"></a>by an attraction between the particles of the salt of Tartar &amp; the <a id="l2317"></a>particles of the water which float in the Aer in the form of vapors? <a id="l2318"></a>And why does not common salt or saltpeter or vitriol run per de<a id="l2319"></a>liquium but for want of such an attraction? Or why does not salt of <a id="l2320"></a>Tartar draw more water out of the Air then in a certain proportion <a id="l2321"></a>to its quantity, but for want of an attractive force after it is sa<a id="l2322"></a>tiated with water? And whence is it but from this attractive <a id="l2323"></a>power that water which alone distills with a gentle  lukewarm <a id="l2324"></a>heat will not destill from salt of Tartar  without a great <a id="l2325"></a>heat? And is it not from the like attractive power between the <a id="l2326"></a>particles of oyle of Vitriol &amp; the particles of water, that Oyle of <a id="l2327"></a>Vitriol draws to it a good quantity of water out of the Air, &amp; after <a id="l2328"></a>it is satiated draws no more, &amp; in destillation lets go the water <a id="l2329"></a>very difficultly? And when water &amp; oyle of Vitriol poured sucessive<a id="l2330"></a>ly into the same vessel grow very hot in the mixing, does not this heat <a id="l2331"></a>argue a great motion in the parts of the liquors? And does not this <a id="l2332"></a>motion argue that the parts of the  two liquors in mixing coa<a id="l2333"></a>less with violence &amp; by consequence rush towards one another with <a id="l2334"></a>an accelerated motion? And when Aqua fortis or spirit of Vitriol <a id="l2335"></a>poured upon filings of iron dissolves the filings with a great heat &amp; <a id="l2336"></a>ebullition, is not this heat &amp; ebullition effected by a violent motion of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p274r"> &lt;274r&gt; </span> the parts, &amp; does not that motion argue that the acid parts of the liquor <a id="l2337"></a>rush towards the parts of the metall with violence, &amp; run forcibly <a id="l2338"></a>into its pores till they get between its outmost particles &amp; the main <a id="l2339"></a>mass of the metall, &amp; surrounding those particles loosen them from the <a id="l2340"></a>main mass &amp; set them at liberty to flote off into the water? And <a id="l2341"></a>when the acid particles which alone would destill with an easy heat <a id="l2342"></a>will not separate from the particles of the metall without a very <a id="l2343"></a>vio[lent heat, does not this confirm the attraction between them?</p>
<p id="par211">When spirit of Vitriol poured upon common salt or saltpeter <a id="l2344"></a>makes an ebullition with the salt &amp; unites with it, &amp; in destillation <a id="l2345"></a>the spirit of the common salt or saltpeter comes over much easier <a id="l2346"></a>then it would do before, &amp; the acid part of the spirit of Vitriol <a id="l2347"></a>stays behind; does not this argue that the fixed Alcaly of the salt <a id="l2348"></a>attracts the acid spirit of the Vitriol more strongly then its own spirit, <a id="l2349"></a>&amp; not being able to hold them both, lets go its own? And when oyle <a id="l2350"></a>of Vitriol is drawn off from its weight of Nitre, &amp; from both the <a id="l2351"></a>ingredients a compound spirit of Nitre is destilled, two parts of which <a id="l2352"></a>being poured on one part of  oyle of cloves or Carvy seeds, or <a id="l2353"></a>of any ponderous vegetable oyle, or oyle of animal substances, or oyle <a id="l2354"></a>of Turpentine thickened with a little Balsam of sulphur, grows so <a id="l2355"></a>very hot in mixing as presently to send up a burning flame: does <a id="l2356"></a>not this very great &amp; sudden heat argue that the two liquors mix <a id="l2357"></a>with violence, &amp; that their parts in mixing run towards one another <a id="l2358"></a>with an accelerated motion, &amp; clash with the greatest force? And is <a id="l2359"></a>it not for the same reason that well rectified spirit of wine poured on the <a id="l2360"></a>same compound spirit flashes, &amp; that the pulvis fulminans composed <a id="l2361"></a>of sulphur Nitre &amp; salt of Tartar, goes off with a more sudden &amp; <a id="l2362"></a>violent explosion then Gun-powder, the acid spirits of the sulphur <a id="l2363"></a>&amp; nitre rushing towards one another &amp; towards the  salt <a id="l2364"></a>of Tartar with so great a violence, as by the shock to turn the <a id="l2365"></a>whole at once into vapour &amp; flame? Where the dissolution is slow <a id="l2366"></a>it makes a slow ebullition &amp; a gentle heat, &amp; where it is quicker it makes <a id="l2367"></a>a greater ebullition with more heat, &amp; where it is done at once the ebulli<a id="l2368"></a>tion is contracted into a sudden blast or violent explosion with a heat <a id="l2369"></a>equal to that of fire &amp; flame. So when a drachm of the above-mentioned <a id="l2370"></a>compound spirit of Nitre was poured upon half a drachm of oyle of Carvi <a id="l2371"></a>sees in vacuo, the mixture immediately made a flash like gunpowder <a id="l2372"></a>&amp; burst the exhausted Receiver, which was a glass six inches wide and <a id="l2373"></a>eight inches deep. And even the gross body of sulphur poudered, &amp; with an <a id="l2374"></a>equal weight of iron filings &amp; a little water made into past, acts upon <a id="l2375"></a>the iron, &amp; in five or six hours grows too hot to be touched, &amp; emits a <a id="l2376"></a>flame. And by these experiments compared with the great quantity of <a id="l2377"></a>Sulphur with which the Earth abounds, &amp; the warmth of the interior parts of <a id="l2378"></a>the earth &amp; hot springs &amp; burning mountains &amp; with damps, mineral corrusca<a id="l2379"></a>tions, earthquakes, hot suffocating exhalations, hurricanes &amp; spouts: we may <a id="l2380"></a>learn that sulphureous steams abound in the bowells of the earth &amp; ferment <a id="l2381"></a>with mineralls, &amp; sometimes take fire with a sudden corruscation &amp; explosi<a id="l2382"></a>on, &amp; if pent up in subterraneous caverns, burst the caverns with a great <a id="l2383"></a>shaking of the earth as in springing of a Mine. And then the vapour <a id="l2384"></a>generated by the explosion, expiring through the pores of the earth, <a id="l2385"></a>feels hot &amp; suffocates &amp; makes tempests &amp; hurricanes, &amp; sometimes causes the <a id="l2386"></a>land to slide, or the sea to boyle, &amp; carries up the water thereof in drops <a id="l2387"></a>which by their weight fall down again in spouts. Also some sulphureous <a id="l2388"></a>steams, at all times when the earth is dry, ascending into the Air, fer<a id="l2389"></a>ment there with nitrous acids, &amp; sometimes taking fire cause lightning <a id="l2390"></a>&amp; thunder &amp; fiery meteors. For the Air abounds with acid vapours fit <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p275r"> &lt;275r&gt; </span> to promote fermentations, as appears by the rusting of iron and copper in it, <a id="l2391"></a>the kindling of fire by blowing, &amp; the beating of the heart by means of <a id="l2392"></a>respiration. Now the above mentioned motions are so great &amp; violent as <a id="l2393"></a>to shew that in fermentations, the particles of bodies which almost rest <a id="l2394"></a>are put into new motions by a very potent principle which acts upon them <a id="l2395"></a>only when they approach one another, &amp; causes them to meet &amp; clash <a id="l2396"></a>with great violence, &amp; grow hot with the motion, &amp; dash one another <a id="l2397"></a>into pieces, &amp; vanish into air &amp; vapour &amp; flame.</p>
<p id="par212">When salt of Tartar per deliquium, being poured into the solution <a id="l2398"></a>of any metal, precipitates the metall, &amp; makes it fall down to the bottom <a id="l2399"></a>of the liquor in the form of mud: does not this argue that the acid <a id="l2400"></a>particles are attracted more strongly by the salt of Tartar then by the <a id="l2401"></a>metall, &amp; by the stronger attraction go from the metal to the salt of <a id="l2402"></a>Tartar? And so when a solution of iron in Aqua fortis dissolves the Lapis <a id="l2403"></a>Calaminaris &amp; lets go the iron, or a solution of Copper dissolves iron <a id="l2404"></a>immersed in it &amp; lets go the copper, or a solution of silver dissolves <a id="l2405"></a>copper &amp; lets go the silver, or a solution of Mercury in Aqua fortis <a id="l2406"></a>being poured upon Iron Copper Tin or Lead, dissolves the metall &amp; lets <a id="l2407"></a>go the Mercury, does not this argue that the acid particles of the Aqua <a id="l2408"></a>fortis are attracted more strongly by the Lapis Calaminaris then by Iron, <a id="l2409"></a>&amp; more strongly by iron then by copper, &amp; more strongly by Copper then <a id="l2410"></a>by silver, &amp; more strongly by Iron Copper Tin &amp; Lead then by Mercury? <a id="l2411"></a>And is it not for the same reason that iron requires more Aqua <a id="l2412"></a>fortis to dissolve it then Copper, &amp; Copper more then the other metalls; <a id="l2413"></a>&amp; that of all metalls, Iron is dissolved most easily, &amp; is most apt to rust; <a id="l2414"></a>&amp; next after Iron, Copper?</p>
<p id="par213">When Oyle of Vitriol is mixed with a little water, or is run per <a id="l2415"></a>deliquium, &amp; in destillation the water ascends difficultly, &amp; brings over <a id="l2416"></a>with it some part of the oyle of Vitriol in the form of spirit of Vitriol, <a id="l2417"></a>&amp; this spirit upon being poured upon iron copper or salt of Tartar <a id="l2418"></a>unites with the body &amp; lets go the  water, doth not this shew <a id="l2419"></a>that the acid spirit is attracted by the water, &amp; more attracted by the <a id="l2420"></a>fixt body then by the water, &amp; therefore lets go the water to close <a id="l2421"></a>with the fixt body? And is it not for the same reason that the water <a id="l2422"></a>&amp; acid spirits which are mixed together in Vinegar, Aqua fortis, &amp; spirit <a id="l2423"></a>of salt, cohere &amp; rise together in destillation; but if the Menstruum <a id="l2424"></a>be poured on salt of Tartar, or on Lead or Iron or any fixt body <a id="l2425"></a>which it can dissolve, the acid by a stronger attraction  adheres to <a id="l2426"></a>the body &amp; lets go the water? And is it not also from a mutual <a id="l2427"></a>attraction that the spirits of soot &amp; sea-salt unite &amp; compose the <a id="l2428"></a>particles of Salarmoniac, which are less volatile then before because <a id="l2429"></a>grosser &amp; freer from water; &amp; that the particles of Salarmoniac <a id="l2430"></a>in sublimation carry up the particles of Antimony which will not <a id="l2431"></a>sublime alone; &amp; that the particles of Mercury uniting with the <a id="l2432"></a>acid particles of spirit of salt compose Mercury sublimate, &amp; with <a id="l2433"></a>the particles of Sulphur compose cinnaber; &amp; that the particles of <a id="l2434"></a>spirit of wine &amp; spirit of urin well rectified unite, &amp; letting go the <a id="l2435"></a>water which dissolved them compose a consistent body; &amp; that in sub<a id="l2436"></a>liming cinnaber from salt of Tartar or from quick lime, the sulphur by <a id="l2437"></a>a stronger attraction of the salt or lime lets go the Mercury &amp; stays <a id="l2438"></a>with the fixt body; &amp; that when Mercury sublimate is sublimed <a id="l2439"></a>from Antimony or from Regulus of Antimony, the spirit of salt <a id="l2440"></a>lets go the Mercury, &amp; unites with the Antimonial metall which <a id="l2441"></a>attracts it more strongly, &amp; stays with it till the heat be great <a id="l2442"></a>enough to make them both ascend together, &amp; then carries up the <a id="l2443"></a>metall with it in the form of a very fusible salt called Butter of <a id="l2444"></a>Antimony, although the spirit of salt alone be almost as volatile as <a id="l2445"></a>water, &amp; the Antimony alone as fixt as Lead?</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p276r"> &lt;276r&gt; </span>
<p id="par214">When Aqua fortis dissolves silver &amp; not gold, &amp; Aqua regia dissolves gold <a id="l2446"></a>&amp; not silver; may it not be said that Aqua fortis is subtile enough to pene<a id="l2447"></a>trate gold as well as silver, but wants the attractive force to give it <a id="l2448"></a>entrance, &amp; that Aqua regia is subtile enough to penetrate silver as <a id="l2449"></a>well as gold, but wants the attractive force to give it entrance? For Aqua <a id="l2450"></a>regia is nothing else then Aqua fortis mixed with some spirit of salt <a id="l2451"></a>or with Salarmoniac; &amp; even common salt dissolved in Aqua fortis <a id="l2452"></a>enables the Menstruum to dissolve gold tho the salt be a gross body. <a id="l2453"></a>When therefore spirit of salt precipitates silver out of Aqua fortis, <a id="l2454"></a>is it not done by attracting &amp; mixing with the Aqua fortis, &amp; not <a id="l2455"></a>attracting or perhaps repelling silver? And when water precipitates <a id="l2456"></a>Antimony out of the sublimate of Antimony &amp; Salarmoniac, or out <a id="l2457"></a>of butter of Antimony, is it not done by its dissolving, mixing with <a id="l2458"></a>&amp; weakening the Salarmoniac or spirit of salt &amp; its not attracting or <a id="l2459"></a>perhaps repelling the Antimony? And is it not for want of an <a id="l2460"></a>attractive vertue between the parts of water &amp; oyle, of Quicksilver &amp; <a id="l2461"></a>Antimony, of Lead &amp; Iron, that these substances do not mix; and by a <a id="l2462"></a>weak attraction that Quicksilver &amp; Copper mix difficultly; &amp; from a <a id="l2463"></a>strong one that Quicksilver &amp; Tin, Antimony &amp; Iron, water &amp; salts <a id="l2464"></a>mix readily? And in general, is it not from the same principle that <a id="l2465"></a>heat congregates homogeneal bodies &amp; separates heterogeneal ones?</p>
<p id="par215">When Arsnick with soap gives a Regulus &amp; with Mercury <a id="l2466"></a>sublimate a volatile fusible salt like butter of Antimony; doth not <a id="l2467"></a>this shew that Arsnick, which is a substance totally volatile, is compound<a id="l2468"></a>ed of fixt &amp; volatile parts strongly cohering by a mutual attraction <a id="l2469"></a>so that the volatile will not ascend without carrying up the fixed? <a id="l2470"></a>And so, when an equal weight of spirit of wine &amp; oyle of vitriol <a id="l2471"></a>are digested together, &amp; in destillation yeild two fragrant volatile <a id="l2472"></a>spirits which will not mix with one another, &amp; a fixt black earth <a id="l2473"></a>remains behind; doth not this shew that oyle of Vitriol is composed <a id="l2474"></a>of volatile &amp; fixed parts strongly united by attraction so as to ascend <a id="l2475"></a>together in form of a volatile acid fluid salt, untill the spirit of wine <a id="l2476"></a>attracts &amp; separates the volatile parts from the fixed? And therefore <a id="l2477"></a>since oyle of sulphur per campanam is of the same nature with <a id="l2478"></a>oyle of Vitriol; may it not be inferred that Sulphur is also a mixture <a id="l2479"></a>of volatile &amp; fixed parts so strongly cohering by attraction as to <a id="l2480"></a>ascend together in sublimation. By dissolving flowers of sulphur in oyle <a id="l2481"></a>of Turpentine &amp; destilling the solution, it is found that Sulphur is composed <a id="l2482"></a>of an inflamable thick oyle or fat bitumen, an acid salt, a very fixed <a id="l2483"></a>earth &amp; a little  metall. The three first were found not much <a id="l2484"></a>unequall to one another, the fourth in so small a quantity as scarce to <a id="l2485"></a>be worth considering. The acid salt dissolved in water is the same with <a id="l2486"></a>Oyle of Sulphur per Campanam, &amp; abounding much in the bowells of the earth <a id="l2487"></a>&amp; particularly in Markasites, unites it self to the other ingredients of <a id="l2488"></a>the Markasite, which are, Bitumen, Iron, Copper &amp; Earth, &amp; with them <a id="l2489"></a>compounds Alume, Vitriol, &amp; Sulphur. With the earth alone it compounds <a id="l2490"></a>Alume; with the Metall alone or Metal &amp;  earth together it compounds <a id="l2491"></a>Vitriol; &amp; with the Bitumen &amp; Earth it compounds Sulphur. Whence it comes <a id="l2492"></a>to pass that Marcasites abound with those three Mineralls. And is it not from <a id="l2493"></a>the mutual attraction of the ingredients that they stick together for compound<a id="l2494"></a>ing these mineralls, &amp; that the Bitumen carries up the other ingredients of <a id="l2495"></a>the sulphur, which without it would not sublime? And the same Question <a id="l2496"></a>may be put concerning all or almost all the gross bodies in nature. For all <a id="l2497"></a>the parts of animals &amp; vegetables are composed of substances volatile &amp; fixed, <a id="l2498"></a>fluid &amp; solid, as appears by their Analysis; &amp; so are salts &amp; minerals so far as <a id="l2499"></a>Chymists have been hitherto able to examin their composition.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p277r"> &lt;277r&gt; </span>
<p id="par216">When Mercury sublimate is resublimed with fresh Mercury &amp; <a id="l2500"></a>becomes Mercurius dulcis, which is a white tastless earth scarce dissolva<a id="l2501"></a>ble in water, and Mercurius dulcis resublimed with spirit of salt returns <a id="l2502"></a>into Mercury sublimate; &amp; when Metalls corroded with a little acid turn <a id="l2503"></a>into rust, which is an earth tastless &amp; indissolvable in water, &amp; this earth <a id="l2504"></a>imbibed with more acid becomes a metallic salt; &amp; when some stones, as <a id="l2505"></a>Spar of Lead, dissolved in proper menstruums become salts; do not these <a id="l2506"></a>things shew that salts are dry earth, &amp; watry acid united by attraction, <a id="l2507"></a>&amp; that the earth will not become a salt without so much acid as makes <a id="l2508"></a>it dissolvable in water? Do not the sharp &amp; pungent tasts of acids arise <a id="l2509"></a>from the strong attraction whereby the acid particles rush upon &amp;  <a id="l2510"></a>agitate the particles of the tongue? And when metalls are dissolved in <a id="l2511"></a>acid menstruums, &amp; the acids in conjunction with the metall act after <a id="l2512"></a>a different manner so that the compound has a different tast much <a id="l2513"></a>milder then before, &amp; sometimes a sweet one; is it not because the acids <a id="l2514"></a>adhere to the metallic particles, &amp; thereby, lose much of their activity? <a id="l2515"></a>And if the acid be in too small a proportion to make the compound dissol<a id="l2516"></a>vable in water, will it not by adhering strongly to the metall become <a id="l2517"></a>unactive &amp; lose its tast, &amp; the compound be a tastless earth? For such <a id="l2518"></a>things as are not dissolvable by the moisture of the tongue, act not upon <a id="l2519"></a>the tast.</p>
<p id="par217">As gravity makes the sea flow round the denser &amp; weightier parts of <a id="l2520"></a>the globe of the earth; so the attraction may make the watry acid flow <a id="l2521"></a>round the denser &amp; compacter particles of earth for composing the parti<a id="l2522"></a>cles of salt. For otherwise the acid would not do the office of a medium <a id="l2523"></a>between the earth &amp; common water for making salts dissolvable in the <a id="l2524"></a>water: nor would salt of Tartar readily draw off the acid from <a id="l2525"></a>dissolved metalls; nor metalls the acid from Mercury. Now as in the <a id="l2526"></a>great globe of the earth &amp; sea, the densest bodies by their gravity <a id="l2527"></a>sink down in water, &amp; always endeavour to go towards the center of <a id="l2528"></a>the globe; so in particles of salt the densest matter may always <a id="l2529"></a>endeavour to approach the center of the particle: so that a particle <a id="l2530"></a>of salt may be compared to a chaos, being dense hard dry &amp; earthy <a id="l2531"></a>in the centre, &amp; rare, soft, moist, &amp; watry in the circumference. And <a id="l2532"></a>hence it seems to be that salts are of a lasting nature, being scarce <a id="l2533"></a>destroyed unless by drawing away their watry parts by violence or <a id="l2534"></a> by letting them soak into the pores of the central <a id="l2535"></a>earth by a gentle heat in putrefaction, untill the earth be dissolved <a id="l2536"></a>by the water, &amp; separated into smaller particles, which by reason <a id="l2537"></a>of their smallness make the rotten compound appear of a black <a id="l2538"></a>colour. Hence also it may be that the parts of animals &amp; vegetables <a id="l2539"></a>preserve their several forms &amp; assimilate their nourishment; the <a id="l2540"></a>soft &amp; moist nourishment easily changing its texture by a gentle <a id="l2541"></a>heat &amp;  motion, till it becomes like the dense hard dry &amp; <a id="l2542"></a>durable earth in the centre of each particle. But when the <a id="l2543"></a>nourishment grows unfit to be assimilated, or the central earth <a id="l2544"></a>grows too feeble to assimilate it, the motion ends in  <a id="l2545"></a>confusion, putrefaction, &amp; death.</p>
<p id="par218">If a very small quantity of any salt or Vitriol be dissolved <a id="l2546"></a>in a great quantity of water, the particles of the salt or vitriol <a id="l2547"></a>will not sink to the bottom, tho they be heavier in specie then the <a id="l2548"></a>water, but will eavenly diffuse themselves into all the water, so <a id="l2549"></a>as to make it as saline at the top as at the bottom. And does <a id="l2550"></a>not this imply that the parts of the salt or Vitriol recede from <a id="l2551"></a>one another, &amp; endeavour to expand themselves, &amp; get as far <a id="l2552"></a>asunder as the quantity of water in which they float, will allow?</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p278r"> &lt;278r&gt; </span>
<p id="par219">And does not this endeavour imply that they have a repulsive force <a id="l2553"></a>by which they fly from one another, or at least that they attract the <a id="l2554"></a>water more strongly then they do one another? For as all things ascend <a id="l2555"></a>in water which are less attracted then water by the gravitating power of <a id="l2556"></a>the earth: so all the particles of salt which float in water &amp; are <a id="l2557"></a>less attracted then water by any one particle of salt, must recede from <a id="l2558"></a>that particle &amp; give way to the more attracted water.</p>
<p id="par220">When any saline liquor is evaporated to a cuticle &amp; let cool, the <a id="l2559"></a>salt concretes in regular figures, which argues that the particles of the <a id="l2560"></a>salt before they concreted, floated in the liquor at equal distances <a id="l2561"></a>in rank &amp; file, &amp; by consequence that they acted upon one another <a id="l2562"></a>by some power which at equal distances is equal, at unequal distances <a id="l2563"></a>unequal. For by such a power they will range themselves uniformly, <a id="l2564"></a>&amp; without it they will float irregularly &amp; come together as irregularly. <a id="l2565"></a>And since the particles of Island Crystall act all the same way upon <a id="l2566"></a>the rays of light for causing the unusual refraction, may it not be <a id="l2567"></a>supposed that in the formation of this crystall, the particles not only <a id="l2568"></a>ranged themselves in rank &amp; file for concreting in regular figures, <a id="l2569"></a>but also by some kind of polar vertue turned their homogeneal sides <a id="l2570"></a>the same way.</p>
<p id="par221">The parts of all homogeneal hard bodies which fully touch one another <a id="l2571"></a>stick together very strongly. And for explaining how this may be some have <a id="l2572"></a>invented hooked atoms, which is begging the question; &amp; others tell us that bodies <a id="l2573"></a>are glued together by rest, that is, by an Occult Quality, or rather by nothing; <a id="l2574"></a>&amp; others that they stick together by conspiring motions, that is, by relative <a id="l2575"></a>rest amongst themselves. I had rather inferr from their cohesion, that their <a id="l2576"></a>particles <em class="underline">attract</em> one another by some force, which in immediate contact <a id="l2577"></a>is exceeding strong, at small distances performs the chymical operations <a id="l2578"></a>above mentioned, &amp; reaches not far from the particles with any sensible <a id="l2579"></a>effect.</p>
<p id="par222">All bodies seem to be composed of hard particles: For otherwise fluids <a id="l2580"></a>would not congeale, as water, oyles, vinegre, &amp; spirit or oyle of Vitriol do <a id="l2581"></a>by freezing, Mercury by fumes of Lead, spirit of Nitre &amp; Mercury by <a id="l2582"></a>dissolving the Mercury &amp; evaporating the flegm, spirit of Wine &amp; spirit <a id="l2583"></a>of Urin by deflegming &amp; mixing them, &amp; spirit of urine &amp; spirit of salt <a id="l2584"></a>by subliming them together to make Salarmoniac. Even the rays of <a id="l2585"></a>light seem to be hard bodies: for otherwise they would not retain different <a id="l2586"></a>properties in their different sides. And therefore hardness may be recconed <a id="l2587"></a>the property of all uncompounded matter. At least this seems to be as <a id="l2588"></a>evident as the universal impenetrability of matter. For all bodies so far <a id="l2589"></a>as experience reaches, are either hard or may be hardned, &amp; we have no <a id="l2590"></a>other evidence of universal impenetrability besides a large experience <a id="l2591"></a>without an experimental exception. Now if compound bodies are so very <a id="l2592"></a>hard as we find some of them to be, &amp; yet are very porous, &amp; consist of <a id="l2593"></a>parts which are only laid together: the simple particles which are void of <a id="l2594"></a>pores &amp; were never yet divided, must be much harder. For such hard parti<a id="l2595"></a>cles being heaped up together, can scarce touch one another in more then <a id="l2596"></a>a few points, &amp; therefore must be separable by much less force then is <a id="l2597"></a>requisite to break a solid particle, whose parts touch in all the space between <a id="l2598"></a>them without any pores or interstices to weaken their cohesion. And how <a id="l2599"></a>such very hard particles which are only laid together &amp; touch only in a <a id="l2600"></a>few points, can stick together, &amp; that so firmly as they do, without the <a id="l2601"></a>assistance of something which causes them to be attracted or prest towards <a id="l2602"></a>one another, is very difficult to conceive.</p>
<p id="par223">The same thing I inferr also from the cohering of two polished Marbles <a id="l2603"></a>in Vacuo, &amp; from the standing of Quicksilver in the Barometer at the height <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p279r"> &lt;279r&gt; </span> of 50, 60 or 70 inches or above, when ever it is well purged of air &amp; <a id="l2604"></a>carefully poured in, so that its parts be every where contiguous, both to <a id="l2605"></a>one another &amp; to the glass. The Atmosphere by its weight presses the Quicksilver ‡ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the top of f 279v &gt; </span>‡ into the glass to the height of 29 or 30 inches. And some other Agent <a id="l2606"></a>raises it higher, not by pressing it into the glass but by making its parts <a id="l2607"></a>stick to the glass &amp; to one another. For upon any discontinuation of <a id="l2608"></a>parts made either by bubbles or by shaking the glass, the whole Mer<a id="l2609"></a>cury falls down to the height of 29 or 30 inches.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 279r resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par224">And of the same kind with these experiments are those that follow. <a id="l2610"></a>If two plane polished plates of glass (suppose two pieces of a polished look<a id="l2611"></a>ing-glass) be laid together so that their sides be parallel &amp; at a very small <a id="l2612"></a>distance from one another, &amp; then their lower edges be dipped into water; <a id="l2613"></a>the water will rise up between them. And the less the distance of the <a id="l2614"></a>glasses is, the greater will be the height to which the water will rise. <a id="l2615"></a>If the distance be about the hundredth part of an inch, the water <a id="l2616"></a>will rise to the height of about an inch; &amp; if the distance be <a id="l2617"></a>greater or less in any proportion, the height will be reciprocally <a id="l2618"></a>proportional to the distance very nearly. For the attractive force of <a id="l2619"></a>the glasses is the same whether the distance between them be greater <a id="l2620"></a>or less; &amp; the weight of the water drawn up, is the same, if the height, <a id="l2621"></a>of it be reciprocally proportional to the  distance of the glasses. And in <a id="l2622"></a>like manner, water ascends between two Marbles polished plane, when <a id="l2623"></a>their polished sides are parallel, &amp; at a very little distance from one <a id="l2624"></a>another. And if slender pipes of glass be dipped at one end into <a id="l2625"></a>stagnating water, the water will rise up within the pipe, &amp; the height <a id="l2626"></a>to which it rises will be reciprocally proportional to the diameter <a id="l2627"></a>of the  cavity of the pipe, &amp; will equal the height to which it <a id="l2628"></a>rises between two planes of glass, if the semidiameter of the cavity <a id="l2629"></a>of the Pipe be equal to the distance between the planes, or thereabouts. <a id="l2630"></a>And these Experiments succeed after the same manner in Vacuo <a id="l2631"></a>as in the open Aer, &amp; therefore are not influenced by the weight or <a id="l2632"></a>pressure of the Atmosphere.</p>
<p id="par225">And if a large Pipe of glass be filled with sifted ashes well <a id="l2633"></a>pressed together in the glass, &amp; one end of the Pipe be dipped into <a id="l2634"></a>stagnating water: the water  will rise up slowly in the ashes so as <a id="l2635"></a>in the space of a week or fortnight to reach up within the glass to the <a id="l2636"></a>height of 30 or 40 inches above the stagnating water. And the water <a id="l2637"></a>rises up to this height by the attraction only of those particles of <a id="l2638"></a>the ashes  which are upon the surface of the elevated water; <a id="l2639"></a>the particles which are within the water, attracting it as much down<a id="l2640"></a>wards as upwards. And therefore the attraction of the particles is very <a id="l2641"></a>strong. But the particles of the ashes being not so dense &amp; close together <a id="l2642"></a>as those of glass their attraction is not so strong as that of glass which keeps <a id="l2643"></a>Quicksilver suspended to the height of  60 or 70 inches &amp; therefore <a id="l2644"></a>attracts with a force which would keep water suspended to the height of above <a id="l2645"></a>fifty feet.</p>
<p id="par226">By the same principle, a Sponge sucks in water, &amp; the Glands in the <a id="l2646"></a>bodies of animals, according to their several natures &amp; dispositions, suck in <a id="l2647"></a>various juices from the blood.</p>
<p id="par227">If two plane polished plates of glass three or four inches broad &amp; <a id="l2648"></a>twenty or twenty five long, be laid, one of them parallel to the horizon, the <a id="l2649"></a>other upon the first so as at one of their ends to touch  one another &amp; <a id="l2650"></a>contein an Angle of about 10 or 15 minutes, &amp; the same be first moistened <a id="l2651"></a>on their inward sides with a clear cloth dipt into oyle of Oranges or spirit of <a id="l2652"></a>Turpentine, &amp; a drop or two of the Oyle or Spirit be let fall upon the lower glass at <a id="l2653"></a>the other end: so soon as the upper glass is laid down upon the lower so <a id="l2654"></a>as to touch it at one end as above, &amp; to touch the drop at the other end, making <a id="l2655"></a>with the lower glass an angle of about 10 or 15 minutes; the drop will begin <a id="l2656"></a>to move towards the concourse of the glasses, &amp; will continue to move with an <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p280r"> &lt;280r&gt; </span> accelerated motion till it arrives at that concourse of the glasses. For the <a id="l2657"></a>two glasses attract the drop &amp; make it run that way towards which the attra<a id="l2658"></a>ctions incline. And if when the drop is in motion you lift up that end of the <a id="l2659"></a>glasses where they meet &amp; towards which the drop moves: the drop will ascend <a id="l2660"></a>between the glasses &amp; therefore is attracted. And as you lift up the glasses <a id="l2661"></a>more &amp; more the drop will ascend slower &amp; slower &amp; at length rest <a id="l2662"></a>being then carried downward by its weight as much as upwards by the attrac<a id="l2663"></a>tion. And by this means you may know the force by which the drop is attra<a id="l2664"></a>cted at all distances from the concourse of the glasses.</p>
<p id="par228">Now by some experiments of this kind it has been found that the attraction <a id="l2665"></a>is almost reciprocally in a duplicate proportion of the distance of the middle <a id="l2666"></a>of the drop from the concourse of the glasses; [viz, reciprocally in a <a id="l2667"></a>simple proportion by reason of the spreading of the drop &amp; its touching <a id="l2668"></a>each glass in a larger surface; &amp; again reciprocally in a simple <a id="l2669"></a>proportion by reason of the  attractions growing <a id="l2670"></a>stronger within the same quantity of attracting surface. The attraction therefore <a id="l2671"></a>within the same quantity of attracting surface, is reciprocally as the dis<a id="l2672"></a>tance between the glasses. And therefore where the distance is exceeding <a id="l2673"></a>small, the attraction must be exceeding great. By the Table in the second <a id="l2674"></a>part of the second Book, wherein the thicknesses of coloured plates of water <a id="l2675"></a>between two glasses are set down, the thickness of the Plate where it appears <a id="l2676"></a>very black, is three eighths of the ten hundred thousandth part of an inch. <a id="l2677"></a>And where the oyle of Oranges between the glasses is of this thickness, the <a id="l2678"></a>attraction collected by the foregoing Rule, seems to be so strong, as within a circle <a id="l2679"></a>of an inch in diameter to suffice to hold up a weight equal to that of a <a id="l2680"></a>cylinder of water of an inch in diameter &amp; two or three furlongs in length. <a id="l2681"></a>And where it is of a less thickness the attraction may be proportionally greater, &amp; <a id="l2682"></a>continue to increase untill the thickness do not exceed that of a single particle of the <a id="l2683"></a>Oyle. There are therefore Agents in nature able to make the particles of <a id="l2684"></a>bodies stick together by very strong attractions. And it is the business of experi<a id="l2685"></a>mental Philosophy to find them out.</p>
<p id="par229">Now the smallest particles of matter may cohere by the strongest <a id="l2686"></a>attractions &amp; compose bigger particles of weaker vertue, &amp; many of these <a id="l2687"></a>may cohere &amp; compose bigger particles whose vertue is still weaker, &amp; so <a id="l2688"></a>on for divers successions untill the progression end in the biggest particles <a id="l2689"></a>on which the operations in Chymistry &amp; the colours of natural bodies depend <a id="l2690"></a>&amp; which by cohering compose bodies of a sensible magnitude. If the body is <a id="l2691"></a>compact &amp; bends or yeilds inward to pression without any sliding of its <a id="l2692"></a>parts, it is hard &amp; elastick, returning to its figure with a force arising <a id="l2693"></a>from the mutual attraction of its parts. If the parts slide upon one another <a id="l2694"></a>the body is malleable or soft. If they slip easily &amp; are of a fit size <a id="l2695"></a>to be agitated by heat, &amp; the heat is big enough to keep them in agitation <a id="l2696"></a>the body is fluid; &amp; if it be apt to stick to things it is humid; &amp; the drops <a id="l2697"></a>of every fluid affect a round figure by the mutual attraction of their <a id="l2698"></a>parts, as the globe of the Earth &amp; Sea affects a round figure  by the <a id="l2699"></a>mutuall attraction of its parts by gravity.</p>
<p id="par230">Since metalls dissolved in acids attract but a small quantity of the <a id="l2700"></a>acid, their attractive force can reach but to a small distance from them. And <a id="l2701"></a>as in Algebra, where affirmative quantities vanish &amp; cease, there negative <a id="l2702"></a>ones begin, so in Mechanicks, where attraction ceases there a repulsive <a id="l2703"></a>vertue ought to succeed. And that there is such a vertue seems to follow <a id="l2704"></a>from the reflexions &amp; inflexions of the rays of light. For the rays <a id="l2705"></a>are repelled by bodies in both these cases without the immediate contact <a id="l2706"></a>of the reflecting or inflecting body. It seems also to follow from the <a id="l2707"></a>emission of light, the ray so soon as it is shaken off from a shining <a id="l2708"></a>body by the vibrating motion of the parts of the body, &amp; gets beyond the reach <a id="l2709"></a>of attraction, being driven away with exceeding great velocity. For that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p281r"> &lt;281r&gt; </span> force which is sufficient to turn it back in reflexion may be sufficient <a id="l2710"></a>to emit it. It seems also to follow from the production of Air &amp; Vapor. <a id="l2711"></a>The particles when they are shaken off from bodies by heat or fermenta<a id="l2712"></a>tion, so soon as they are beyond the reach of the attraction of the body, <a id="l2713"></a>receding from it, &amp; also from one another with great strength, &amp; keeping <a id="l2714"></a>at a distance, so as sometimes to take up above a million of times more <a id="l2715"></a>space then they did before in the form of a dense body. Which vast <a id="l2716"></a>contraction &amp; expansion seems unintelligible by feigning the particles of Air <a id="l2717"></a>to be  springy &amp; ramous, or rolled up like hoops, or by any other <a id="l2718"></a>means then a repulsive power. The particles of fluids which do not cohere <a id="l2719"></a>too strongly &amp; are of such a smallness as renders them most susceptible of those <a id="l2720"></a>agitations which keep liquors in a fluor, are most easily separated &amp; rarefied <a id="l2721"></a>into vapor, &amp; in the language of the Chymists, they are volatile, rarefy<a id="l2722"></a>ing with an easy heat &amp; condensing with cold. But those which are <a id="l2723"></a>grosser &amp; so less susceptible of agitation or cohere by a stronger attracti<a id="l2724"></a>on, are not separated without a stronger heat, or perhaps, not without <a id="l2725"></a>fermentation. And these last are the bodies which Chemists call fixed, &amp; <a id="l2726"></a>being rarefied by fermentation become true permanent air: those <a id="l2727"></a>particles receding from one another with the greatest force, &amp; being <a id="l2728"></a>most difficultly brought together, which upon contact cohere most strongly. <a id="l2729"></a>And because the particles of permanent Air are grosser &amp; arise from <a id="l2730"></a> denser substances then those of vapors, thence it is that <a id="l2731"></a>true Air is more ponderous then vapor, &amp; that a moist atmosphere <a id="l2732"></a>is lighter then a dry one quantity for quantity. From the same re<a id="l2733"></a>pelling power it seems to be that flyes walk upon the water without <a id="l2734"></a>wetting their feet; &amp; that the Object-glasses of long Telescopes lye <a id="l2735"></a>upon one another without touching; &amp; that dry pouders are difficultly <a id="l2736"></a>made to touch one another so as to stick together, unless by melting <a id="l2737"></a>them, or wetting them with water which by exhaling may bring them <a id="l2738"></a>together; &amp; that two polished marbles which by immediate contact stick <a id="l2739"></a>together, are difficultly brought  so close together as to stick.</p>
<p id="par231">And thus Nature will be very conformable to her self &amp; very sim<a id="l2740"></a>ple, performing all the great motions of the heavenly bodies by the attrac<a id="l2741"></a>tion of gravity which intercedes those bodies, &amp; almost all the small ones of <a id="l2742"></a>their particles by some other attractive &amp; repelling powers which interceede <a id="l2743"></a>the particles. The Vis inertiæ is a passive principle by which bodies persist <a id="l2744"></a>in their motion or rest, receive motion in proportion to the force impressing <a id="l2745"></a>it, &amp; resist as much as they are resisted. By this Principle alone there <a id="l2746"></a>never could have been any motion in the world. Some other Principle <a id="l2747"></a>was necessary for putting bodies into motion; &amp; now they are in motion some <a id="l2748"></a>other Principle is necessary for conserving the motion. For from the various <a id="l2749"></a>composition of two motions tis very certain that there is not always the <a id="l2750"></a>same quantity of motion in the world. For if two globes joyned by a slender <a id="l2751"></a>rod, revolve about their common center of gravity with an uniform motion <a id="l2752"></a>while that center moves on uniformly in a right line drawn in the plane <a id="l2753"></a>of their circular motion; the summ of the motions of the two globes, <a id="l2754"></a>as often as the globes are in the right line described by their common <a id="l2755"></a>center of gravity, will be bigger then the summ of their motions when <a id="l2756"></a>they are in a line perpendicular to that right line. By this instance <a id="l2757"></a>it appears that motion may be got or lost. But by reason of the <a id="l2758"></a>tenacity of fluids, &amp; attrition of their parts, &amp; the weakness of elasticity <a id="l2759"></a>in solids, motion is much more apt to be  lost then got, &amp; is always <a id="l2760"></a>upon the decay. For bodies which are either absolutely hard, or so soft <a id="l2761"></a>as to be void of elasticity, will not rebound from one another. Impenetra<a id="l2762"></a>bility makes them only stop. If two equal bodies meet directly in Vacuo <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p282r"> &lt;282r&gt; </span> they will by the laws of motion stop where they meet &amp; lose all their motion <a id="l2763"></a>&amp; remain in rest unless they be elastick &amp; receive new motion from their spring. <a id="l2764"></a>If they have so much elasticity as suffices to make them rebound with a quarter or <a id="l2765"></a>half or three quarters of the force with which they come together, they will lose <a id="l2766"></a>three quarters or half or a quarter of their motion. And this may be tried by letting <a id="l2767"></a>two equal Pendulums fall against one another from equal heights. If the Pendulums <a id="l2768"></a>be of lead or soft clay they will lose all or almost all their motions: if of <a id="l2769"></a>elastick bodies they will lose all but what they recover from their elasticity. <a id="l2770"></a>If it be said that they can lose no motion but what they communicate to other <a id="l2771"></a>bodies; the consequence is that in Vacuo they can lose no motion, but when they <a id="l2772"></a>meet they must go on &amp; penetrate one anothers dimensions. If three equal <a id="l2773"></a>round Vessels be filled the one with water, the other with oyle, the third with <a id="l2774"></a>molten pitch, &amp; the liquors be stirred about alike to give them a vortical <a id="l2775"></a>motion: the pitch by its tenacity will lose its motion quickly, the oyle being <a id="l2776"></a>less tenacious will keep it longer, &amp; the water being least tenacious will keep <a id="l2777"></a>it longest, but yet will lose it in a short time. Whence it is easy to under<a id="l2778"></a>stand that if many contiguous Vortices of molten pitch were each of <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>them<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> as <a id="l2779"></a>large as those which some suppose to revolve about the Sun &amp; fixt <a id="l2780"></a>starrs, yet these &amp; all their parts would by their tenacity &amp; stifness <a id="l2781"></a>communicate their motion to one another till they all rested among <a id="l2782"></a>themselves. Vortices of oyle or water or some fluider matter might <a id="l2783"></a>continue longer in motion, but unless the matter were void of all <a id="l2784"></a>tenacity &amp; attrition of parts &amp; communication of motion (which is not to <a id="l2785"></a>be supposed,) the motion would constantly decay. Seing therefore the <a id="l2786"></a>variety of motion which we  find in the world is always decreasing, <a id="l2787"></a>there is a necessity of conserving &amp; recruiting it by active principles, <a id="l2788"></a>such as are the cause of gravity by which Planets &amp; Comets keep their <a id="l2789"></a>motions in their Orbs &amp; bodies acquire great motion in falling; &amp; the <a id="l2790"></a>cause of fermentation by which the heart &amp; blood of animals are kept <a id="l2791"></a>in perpetual motion &amp; heat, the inward parts of the earth are con<a id="l2792"></a>stantly warmed &amp; in some places grow very hot, bodies burn &amp; shine, <a id="l2793"></a>mountains take fire, the caverns of the earth are blown up, &amp; the Sun <a id="l2794"></a>continues violently hot &amp; lucid &amp; warms all things by his light. For <a id="l2795"></a>we meet with very little motion in the world besides what is oweing <a id="l2796"></a>to these active Principles. And if it were not for these Principles the bodies <a id="l2797"></a>of the Earth, Planets, Comets, Sun, &amp; all things in them would grow cold &amp; <a id="l2798"></a>freeze &amp; become inactive masses, &amp; all putrefaction generation vegetation <a id="l2799"></a>&amp; life would cease, &amp;  the Planets &amp; Comets would not remain <a id="l2800"></a>in their Orbs.</p>
<p id="par232">All these things being considered, it seems to me that God in the beginn<a id="l2801"></a>ing formed matter in solid massy hard impenetrable moveable particles of <a id="l2802"></a>such sizes &amp; figures &amp; with such other properties &amp; in such proportion to <a id="l2803"></a>space as most conduced to the end for which he formed them, &amp; that these <a id="l2804"></a>primitive particles being solids are incomparably harder then any porous <a id="l2805"></a>bodies compounded of them; even so very hard as never to wear or <a id="l2806"></a>break in pieces: no ordinary power being able to divide what God himself <a id="l2807"></a>made one in the first creation. While the particles continue entire they <a id="l2808"></a>may compose bodies of one &amp; the same nature &amp; texture in all ages: but <a id="l2809"></a>should they weare away, or break in pieces, the nature of things depending <a id="l2810"></a>on them, would be changed. Water &amp; Earth composed of old worn particles <a id="l2811"></a>&amp; fragments of particles would not be of the same nature &amp; texture now <a id="l2812"></a>with water &amp; earth composed of entire particles in the beginning. And <a id="l2813"></a>therefore that nature may be lasting, the changes of corporeal things <a id="l2814"></a>are to be placed only in the various separations &amp; new associations &amp; motions <a id="l2815"></a>of these permanent particles; compound bodies being apt to break, not in <a id="l2816"></a>the midst of solid particles, but where those particles are laid together  <a id="l2817"></a>&amp; only touch in a few points.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p283r"> &lt;283r&gt; </span>
<p id="par233">It seems to me further that these particles have not only a <em class="underline">Vis inertiæ</em> <a id="l2818"></a>accompanied with such passive laws of motion as naturally result from <a id="l2819"></a>that force, but also that they are moved by certain active principles <a id="l2820"></a>such as is that of Gravity &amp; that which causes fermentation &amp; the cohesion <a id="l2821"></a>of bodies. These Principles I consider not as Occult Qualities supposed to result <a id="l2822"></a>from the specific forms of things, but as general laws of nature by which <a id="l2823"></a>the things [themselves are formed: their truth appearing to us by phænomena <a id="l2824"></a>though their causes be not yet discovered. For these are manifest quali<a id="l2825"></a>ties, &amp; their causes only are occult. To tell us that every species of things is <a id="l2826"></a>endowed with an occult specific quality by which it acts &amp; produces manifest <a id="l2827"></a>effects, is to tell us nothing: but to derive two or three general Principles <a id="l2828"></a>of motion from Phænomena, &amp; afterwards to tell us how the properties <a id="l2829"></a>&amp; actions of all corporeal things follow from those manifest Principles, <a id="l2830"></a>would be a very great step in Philosophy, tho the causes of those Prin<a id="l2831"></a>ciples were not yet discovered: &amp; therefore I scruple not to propose the <a id="l2832"></a>Principles of motion above mentioned, they being of very general extent, <a id="l2833"></a>&amp; leave their causes to be found out.</p>
<p id="par234">Now by the help of these Principles all  material things <a id="l2834"></a>seem to have been composed of the hard &amp; solid Particles above men<a id="l2835"></a>tioned variously associated in the first creation by the counsell of an <a id="l2836"></a>intelligent Agent. For it became him who created them to set them <a id="l2837"></a>in order. And if he did so, it's unphilosophical to seek for any other <a id="l2838"></a>origin of the world, or to pretend that it might arise out of a Chaos <a id="l2839"></a>by the mere laws of nature; tho being once formed it may con<a id="l2840"></a>tinue by those laws for many ages. For while Comets move in very <a id="l2841"></a>excentric Orbs in all manner of positions, blind fate could never make <a id="l2842"></a>all the Planets move one &amp; the same way in Orbs concentrick, some inconside<a id="l2843"></a>rable irregularities excepted which may have risen from the mutual actions <a id="l2844"></a>of Comets &amp; Planets upon one another, &amp; which will be apt to increase till <a id="l2845"></a>this Systeme wants a reformation. Such a wonderfull uniformity in the <a id="l2846"></a>Planetary Systeme must be allowed the effect of choise. And so must the <a id="l2847"></a>uniformity in the bodies of Animals, they having generally a right &amp; a <a id="l2848"></a>left side shaped alike &amp; on either side of their bodies two leggs behind <a id="l2849"></a>&amp; either two arms or two leggs or two wings before upon their sholders <a id="l2850"></a>&amp; between their sholders a neck running down into a back bone &amp; a head <a id="l2851"></a>upon it, &amp; in the head two ears, two eyes, a nose, a mouth &amp; a tongue alike <a id="l2852"></a>situated. Also the first contrivance of those very artificial parts of animals, <a id="l2853"></a>the eyes, ears, brain, muscles, heart, Lungs, Midriff, Glands, Larynx, Hands, <a id="l2854"></a>Wings, Swimming-bladders, natural Spectables, &amp; other organs of sense &amp; moti<a id="l2855"></a>on, &amp; the Instinct of Brutes &amp; Insects, can be the effect of nothing else <a id="l2856"></a>then the wisdome &amp; skill of a powerful ever living agent, who being in <a id="l2857"></a>all places is more able by his Will to move the  bodies within his <a id="l2858"></a>boundless unorganized  uniform Sensorium &amp; thereby to form &amp; reform the <a id="l2859"></a>parts of the Universe, then we are by our will to move the parts of our <a id="l2860"></a>own bodies. And yet we are not to consider the world as the body of God or <a id="l2861"></a>the  several parts thereof as the parts of God.  He is an uniform <a id="l2862"></a>Being void of Organs, Members, or Parts, &amp; they are his Creatures subordinate <a id="l2863"></a>to him &amp; subservient to his will, &amp; he is no more the soul of them then <a id="l2864"></a>the Soul of a man is the Soul of the Species of things carried through the <a id="l2865"></a>Organs of Sense into the place of its sensation, where  it perceives them <a id="l2866"></a>by means of its immediate presence without the intervention of any third thing. <a id="l2867"></a>The Organs of Sense are not for enabling the soul to perceive the Species <a id="l2868"></a>of things in its Sensorium, but only for conveying them thither, &amp; God has <a id="l2869"></a>no need of such Organs, he being every where present to the things themselves. <a id="l2870"></a>And since space is divisible in infinitum &amp; matter is not necessarily in all <a id="l2871"></a>places, it may be also allowed that God is able to create  particles o<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>f<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p284r"> &lt;284r&gt; </span> matter of several sizes &amp; figures &amp; in several proportions to space, <a id="l2872"></a>&amp; perhaps of different densities &amp; forces, &amp; thereby to vary the Laws <a id="l2873"></a>of Nature, &amp; make worlds of several sorts in several parts of the <a id="l2874"></a>Universe. At least I see nothing of contradiction in all this.</p>
    <p id="par235">As in Mathematicks so in Natural Philosophy the investigation of <a id="l2875"></a>difficult things by the Method of Analysis ought ever to precede the <a id="l2876"></a>method of composition. This Analysis consists in making Experiments &amp; obser<a id="l2877"></a>vations &amp; in drawing general conclusions from them by Induction, &amp; admitting <a id="l2878"></a>of no objections against the Conclusions but such as are taken from experiments <a id="l2879"></a>or other certain truths. For Hypotheses are not to be regarded in experimen<a id="l2880"></a>tal Philosophy. And altho the arguing from experiments &amp; observations by <a id="l2881"></a>Induction be no demonstration of general  Conclusions yet it is the best <a id="l2882"></a>way of arguing which the nature of things admits of, &amp; may be looked <a id="l2883"></a>upon as so much the stronger by how much the Induction is more general <a id="l2884"></a>And if no exception occur from Phænomena the conclusion may be pro<a id="l2885"></a>nounced generally. But if at any time afterwards any exception shall occur from <a id="l2886"></a>experiments, it may then begin to be pronounced with such exceptions as <a id="l2887"></a>occur. By this way of Analysis we may proceed from compounds to <a id="l2888"></a>ingredients, &amp; from motions to the forces producing them, &amp; in general <a id="l2889"></a>from effects to their causes, &amp; from particular causes to more general <a id="l2890"></a>ones, till the Argument end in the most general. This is the Method of <a id="l2891"></a>Analysis: &amp; the Synthesis consists in assuming the causes discovered &amp; <a id="l2892"></a>established as Principles, &amp; by them explaining the Phenomena pro<a id="l2893"></a>ceeding from them, &amp; proving the explanations.</p>
<p id="par236">In the two first books of these Opticks, I proceeded by this <a id="l2894"></a>Analysis to discover &amp; prove the original differences of the rays of light in <a id="l2895"></a>respect of refrangibility, reflexibility, &amp; colour, &amp; their alternate fits of <a id="l2896"></a>easy reflexion &amp; easy transmission, &amp; the properties of bodies both opake &amp; <a id="l2897"></a>pellucid on which their reflexions &amp; colours depend. And these discoveries <a id="l2898"></a>being proved may be assumed in the method of Composition for explaining <a id="l2899"></a>the Phænomena arising from them:  an instance of which Method I <a id="l2900"></a>gave in the end of the first Book. In this third Book I have only begun <a id="l2901"></a>the Analysis of what remains to be discovered about light &amp; its effects <a id="l2902"></a>upon the frame of nature, hinting several things about it &amp; leaving <a id="l2903"></a>the hints to be examined &amp; improved by the farther experiments &amp; <a id="l2904"></a>observations of such as are inquisitive. And if natural Philosophy in <a id="l2905"></a>all its parts, by pursuing this method, shall at length be perfected, the <a id="l2906"></a>bounds of moral Philosophy will be also enlarged. For so far as we <a id="l2907"></a>can know by Natural Philosophy what is the first Cause, what power <a id="l2908"></a>he has over us, &amp; what benefits we receive from him, so far our <a id="l2909"></a>duty towards him as well as that towards one another, will appear to <a id="l2910"></a>us by the light of Nature. And no doubt, if the worship of fals <a id="l2911"></a>Gods had not blinded the heathen, their moral Philosophy would have <a id="l2912"></a>gone further then to the four Cardinal Vertues; &amp; instead of teaching <a id="l2913"></a>the transmigration of souls &amp; to worship the Sun &amp; Moon &amp; dead Heroes, <a id="l2914"></a>they would have taught us to worship our true Author &amp; Benefactor.</p> <span class="pagenumber" id="p285r"> &lt;285r&gt; </span>
<p id="par237">All these things being considered it seems to me that God [Deus O. M.] in the <a id="l2915"></a>beginning <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">created</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">formed</span></span> matter in solid  massy hard impenetrable moveable particles <a id="l2916"></a>of such sizes &amp; figures &amp; with such other properties &amp; in such proportion to <a id="l2917"></a>space as most conduced to the end for which he created them. And that these <a id="l2918"></a>primitive particles being solids are incomparably harder then any porous bodies <a id="l2919"></a>compounded of them; even so very hard as never to weare or break in pieces: <a id="l2920"></a>no ordinary power being able to divide what God himself made one in <a id="l2921"></a>the first creation. While these particles continue entire they may <a id="l2922"></a>compose bodies of the same nature &amp; texture in all ages: but should <a id="l2923"></a>they weare away or break in pieces, the nature of things depending on them <a id="l2924"></a>would be changed. Water &amp; Earth composed of old worn particles &amp; <a id="l2925"></a>fragments of particles would not be of the same nature &amp; texture <a id="l2926"></a>now with water &amp; earth composed of entire particles in the begin<a id="l2927"></a>ning. And therefore that nature may be lasting, the changes of corporeal things are to <a id="l2928"></a>be placed only in the various separations  &amp;, new associations &amp; motions of these <a id="l2929"></a>permanent particles, compound bodies being apt to break not in the midst of solid particles but where those particles are laid together &amp; only touch in a few points.</p>
<p id="par238"> It seems to me further that these  particles have not <a id="l2930"></a>only a Vis inertiæ  accompanied with such passive laws of motion as natu<a id="l2931"></a>rally result from that force, but also that they are   moved by <a id="l2932"></a>certain active principles  such as is that of Gravity &amp; that which <a id="l2933"></a>causes fermentation &amp; the cohesion of bodies. These Principles I consider <a id="l2934"></a>not as occult Qualities  supposed to  result from the specific forms <a id="l2935"></a>of things but as general Laws of Nature  <a id="l2936"></a>by which the things themselves . are formed: Their Truth appearing to us by phænomena, though their causes be not yet explaind. To tell us that every species of things is endowed with <a id="l2937"></a>an occult specificly Quality by which it acts, is to tell us nothing; but to derive <a id="l2938"></a>two or three general Principles of motion from Phænomena, &amp; after<a id="l2939"></a>wards to tell us how the properties &amp; actions of all corporeal things <a id="l2940"></a>follow from those manifest Principles, would be a very great step in Philosophy, <a id="l2941"></a>tho the  causes of those Principles were not yet discovered: &amp; therefore <a id="l2942"></a>I scruple not to propose the Principles of motion above mentioned, they <a id="l2943"></a>being of very general extent.</p>

<p id="par240">As in Mathematicks so in Natural Philosophy the investigation of difficult things <a id="l2984"></a>by the method of Analysis ought ever to precede the method of Composition. This Analysis <a id="l2985"></a>consists in  making experiments &amp; observations &amp; in arguing by them from compositions to ingredients &amp; from motions to the forces pro<a id="l2986"></a>ducing them &amp; in general from   effects to their causes &amp; from particular <a id="l2987"></a>causes to more general ones, till the Argument end in the most general: The Syn<a id="l2988"></a>thesis consists in assuming the causes discovered &amp; established, as Principles;  &amp; by <a id="l2989"></a>them explaining the Phænomena proceeding from them, &amp; proving the explanations. <a id="l2990"></a>In the two first Books of these Opticks I proceeded by Analysis to discover <a id="l2991"></a>&amp; prove the original differences of the rays of light in respect of refrangibility <a id="l2992"></a>reflexibility &amp; colour &amp; their alternate fits of easy reflexion &amp; easy transmissi<a id="l2993"></a>on &amp; the properties of bodies both opake &amp; pellucid on which their reflexions <a id="l2994"></a>&amp; colours depend: &amp; these discoveries being proved may be assumed as Principles <a id="l2995"></a>in the method of Composition for explaining the phænomena arising from  <a id="l2996"></a>them: an instance of which Method I gave in the end of the first Book. In <a id="l2997"></a>this third Book I have only begun the Analysis of what remains to be <a id="l2998"></a>discovered about light &amp; its effects upon the frame of Nature, hinting several <a id="l2999"></a>things about it &amp; leaving the hints to be examined &amp; improved by the further <a id="l3000"></a>experiments &amp; observations of such as are inquisitive. And if Natural <a id="l3001"></a>Philosophy in all its parts, by pursuing this Method, shall at length be <a id="l3002"></a>perfected, the bounds of Moral Philosophy will be also enlarged. For so far <a id="l3003"></a>as we can know by Natural Philosophy what  is the first Cause, what power he has over <a id="l3004"></a>us, &amp; what benefits we receive from him, so far our duty towards him as <a id="l3005"></a>well as that towards one another will appear to us by the light of Nature. <a id="l3006"></a>And no doubt, if the worship of false Gods had not blinded the Heathens, their <a id="l3007"></a>Moral Philosophy would have gone further then to the four Cardinal Vertues. <a id="l3008"></a>&amp; instead of teaching us the transmigration of Souls, &amp; to worship the Sun &amp; Moon &amp; dead Heroes, they would have <a id="l3009"></a>tought us to worship our true Author &amp; Benefactor.</p>

<p id="par241">Qu. 20. Are not the rays of light very small bodies refracted by means <a id="l3010"></a>of certain attractions which intercede then &amp; the parts of pellucid bodies? <a id="l3011"></a> The common opinions are that light is made either by pressi<a id="l3012"></a>on or motion propagated through a fluid or by bodies projected. If it consisted <a id="l3013"></a>only in pression propagated without actual motion, it would not be able to agitate <a id="l3014"></a>&amp; heate the bodies which refract &amp; reflect it. If it consisted in motion propa<a id="l3015"></a>gated to all distances in an instant, it would require an infinite force to generate that <a id="l3016"></a>motion. Light moves in right lines without bending or spreading into the <a id="l3017"></a>shadow beyond the bounds of those right lines in which it begins to move. <a id="l3018"></a>But pression or motion cannot be propagated in a fluid in right lines <a id="l3019"></a>beyond an obstacle which stops part of the motion; but bends &amp; spreads <a id="l3020"></a>every way into the quiescent medium which lies beyond the obstacle.  <a id="l3021"></a>Gravity tends downwards, but the pressure of water arising from gravity <a id="l3022"></a>tends every way with equal force &amp; is propagated as readily &amp; with as <a id="l3023"></a>much force side ways as downwards &amp; through crooked passages as through streight ones. The waves <a id="l3024"></a> on the surface of water passing by the sides of a broad obstacle bend &amp; <a id="l3025"></a>dilate themselves gradually into the quiet water behind the obstacle. The <a id="l3026"></a>waves pulses or vibrations of the Air wherein sounds consist bend manifestly <a id="l3027"></a>tho not so much as the waves of water. For a Bell or a Canon may be <a id="l3028"></a>heard beyond a hill which intercepts the sight of the sounding body &amp; sounds <a id="l3029"></a>are propagated as readily through crooked pipes as through streight ones. <a id="l3030"></a>But light is never known to follow crooked passages nor to bend into the shadow <a id="l3031"></a>For the fixt stars by the interposition of any of the Planets cease to be <a id="l3032"></a>seen &amp; so do the parts of the Sun by the interposition of the Moon Mercury <a id="l3033"></a>or Venus. The rays which pass very neare to the edges of  any body <a id="l3034"></a>are bent a little by the action of the body as we shewed above; but <a id="l3035"></a>this bending is not towards but from the shadow &amp; is performed only in <a id="l3036"></a>the passage of the ray by the body. So soon as the ray is past the body it <a id="l3037"></a>goes right on.</p>
<p id="par242">To explain the  unusual refraction of Island-Crystal by pression or <a id="l3038"></a>motion propagated has not hitherto been attempted (to my knowledge) except <a id="l3039"></a>by Hugenius who for that end supposed two several vibrating Mediums <a id="l3040"></a>within that crystal: but when he  tried the refractions in two successive pieces of that crystal <a id="l3041"></a>&amp; found them such as is mentioned in the two last preceding Questions; he <a id="l3042"></a>confest himself at a loss for explaining them: For pressions or motions <a id="l3043"></a>propagated from a shining body through an uniform medium must be on <a id="l3044"></a>all sides alike: whereas by those experiments it appears that the rays of <a id="l3045"></a>light have different properties in their different sides. He suspected that the <a id="l3046"></a>pulses of Æther in passing through the first crystal might receive <a id="l3047"></a>certain new modifications which might determin them to be propagated in <a id="l3048"></a>this or that Medium within the second crystal according to the position of that  crystal: but <a id="l3049"></a>what modifications those might be he could not say nor think of any <a id="l3050"></a>thing satisfactory in this point.: And its more difficult to  conceive how such <a id="l3051"></a>modifications can be in the rays originally, if light be nothing else then <a id="l3052"></a>pression or motion propagated through fluids. For the refractions reflexions <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p288r"> &lt;288r&gt; </span> inflexions &amp; colours of light depend on such properties as are in the rays <a id="l3053"></a>originaly &amp; suffer no change by the passing of the rays through several <a id="l3054"></a>mediums: &amp; therefore all Hypotheses are to be laid aside in which those <a id="l3055"></a>phænomena are derived from new modifications of the rays.</p>
<p id="par243">By the regular &amp; very lasting motions of Comets &amp; Planets through the <a id="l3056"></a>heavens in all manner of positions its manifest that the heavens are void <a id="l3057"></a>of all sensible resistence [&amp; therefore may let the rays of light go through <a id="l3058"></a>them in right lines with an uniform motion to very great distances, although <a id="l3059"></a>those rays should be bodies]. The resistance of fluid Mediums arises partly <a id="l3060"></a>from the attrition of the parts of the Medium &amp; principally from the Vis <a id="l3061"></a>inertiæ of the matter. That part of the resistance which arises from <a id="l3062"></a>the attrition of the parts may be diminished by dividing the matter into <a id="l3063"></a>smaller parts &amp; making the parts more smooth &amp; slippery: but that part <a id="l3064"></a>of the resistance which arises from the Vis inertiæ is proportional to the <a id="l3065"></a>density of the matter &amp; cannot be diminished by dividing the matter nor by <a id="l3066"></a>any other means then by decreasing the density. And for these reasons the density of fluid Mediums is very nearly proportional to their resistance Water is 13 or 14 times <a id="l3067"></a> lighter then  Quicksilver, &amp; by consequence 13 or 14 times rarer, &amp; it's re<a id="l3068"></a>sistance is less then that of Quicksilver in the same proportion or <a id="l3069"></a>thereabouts as I have found by Pendulums.   The open Air in which we breath is eight or nine hundred times lighter then water, &amp; by conse<a id="l3070"></a>quence  eight or nine hundred times rarer, &amp; accordingly its resistance is less then that of water <a id="l3071"></a>in the same proportion or thereabouts as I have also found by Pendulums..  And if the Air be made still thinner &amp; thinner its resistance becomes less &amp; less untill it be insensible. <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the middle of f 287v &gt; </span>And in thinner Air the resistance is still less &amp; by rarefying the air becomes at length insensible.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 288r resumes &gt; </span> For feathers falling in the open Air meet with great resistance <a id="l3073"></a>but in a tall glass wall emptied of Air they fall as fast as lead or gold <a id="l3074"></a>as I have seen tried several times. And the heavens are emptier of <a id="l3075"></a>Air then any Vacuum we can make below &amp; therefore have less re<a id="l3076"></a>sistance. Liquors which differ not much in density, as water spirit of wine <a id="l3077"></a>spirit of Turpentine, hot oyle, differ not much in resistance, &amp; the reason <a id="l3078"></a>is because their rersistances arise chiefly from the Vis inertiæ. Heat increases <a id="l3079"></a>fluidity &amp; makes many bodies fluid which are  not fluid in cold &amp; accordingly decreases their resistance as may be tried in oyle but decreases not the <a id="l3080"></a>resistance of water considerably as it would do if any great part of its resistance arose from the attrition or tenacity of its parts, &amp; therefore the  resistence of water <a id="l3081"></a>arises chiefly from the Vis inertiæ; &amp; by consequence if the heavens were as dense as water <a id="l3082"></a>they would not have much less resistence then water, if as dense as quick<a id="l3083"></a>silver they would not have much less resistence then quicksilver, if abso<a id="l3084"></a>lutely dense or full of matter without any Vacuum, let the matter be <a id="l3085"></a>never so fluid, they would have a greater resistance then  Quicksilver. A <a id="l3086"></a>solid globe in such a Medium would lose above half its motion in <a id="l3087"></a>moving  three times the length of its diameter &amp; a globe not <a id="l3088"></a>solid would be retarded sooner. And therefore to make way for the lasting <a id="l3089"></a>motions of Comets &amp; Planets its necessary to empty the heavens of all <a id="l3090"></a>matter except perhaps some very thin vapors steams or effluvia  arising from the Atmo<a id="l3091"></a>spheres of the Earth Planets &amp; Comets. Such matter is of no use for <a id="l3092"></a>explaining the Phenomena of nature, the motions of the Planets &amp; <a id="l3093"></a>Comets being better explained  by gravity without it, &amp; gravity <a id="l3094"></a>not being hitherto explained by it. It serves only to disturbe &amp; retard <a id="l3095"></a>the motions of those great bodies &amp; make the frame of nature languish <a id="l3096"></a>&amp; in the pores of bodies it serves only to stop the vibrating motions of their <a id="l3097"></a>parts wherein their heat &amp; activity consists.. And as it is of no use &amp; hinders the operations of nature &amp; makes her languish so there <a id="l3098"></a>is no evidence for its existence; &amp; therefore it ought to be rejected. And if <a id="l3099"></a>it be rejected, the Hypotheses that light consists in pression or motion propagated <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p289r"> &lt;289r&gt; </span> through such a Medium are rejected with it. And for rejecting such a Medium <a id="l3100"></a>we have also the authority of those the oldest &amp; most celebrated Philosophers of <a id="l3101"></a>Greece &amp; Phenicia,  who made a Vacuum, Atoms &amp; the gravity of Atoms the <a id="l3102"></a>first principles of their philosophy</p>
<p id="par244">I have therefore proposed the Question whether the rays of light <a id="l3103"></a>may not be small bodies emitted by shining substances. Certainly the <a id="l3104"></a>resemblance between the rays &amp;  such bodies is very great. For  such bodies will pass <a id="l3105"></a>through uniform Mediums in right lines without bending into the shadow <a id="l3106"></a>which is the property of the rays of light. Pellucid substances act upon <a id="l3107"></a>the rays of light at a distance in refracting reflecting &amp; inflecting <a id="l3108"></a>them, &amp; the rays mutually agitate the parts of those substances <a id="l3109"></a>at a distance for heating them, &amp; this action &amp; reaction very much <a id="l3110"></a>resembles an attractive force. If refraction be performed by attraction <a id="l3111"></a>of the rays, the sines of incidence must be to the sines of refraction in <a id="l3112"></a>a given proportion as we shewed in our Principles of Philosophy; &amp; this <a id="l3113"></a>Rule is true by experience. If the rays of light in going out of <a id="l3114"></a>a glass into a Vacuum fall too obliquely on the Vacuum, they are <a id="l3115"></a>totaly reflected which seems to argue an attraction of the glass. <a id="l3116"></a>Colours &amp; Refractions depend not on new modifications of light but <a id="l3117"></a>on the original &amp; unchangeable properties of its rays, &amp; such proper<a id="l3118"></a>ties are best conserved in bodies projected. Pressions &amp; motions are <a id="l3119"></a>apt to receive new modifications in passing through several Mediums <a id="l3120"></a>but the properties of bodies projected will scarce be altered thereby. No<a id="l3121"></a>thing more is requisite for producing all the variety of colours &amp; degrees <a id="l3122"></a>of refrangibility then that the rays be bodies of different sizes the least <a id="l3123"></a>of which may make violet the weakest &amp; darkest of colours &amp; be more easily diverted by <a id="l3124"></a>refracting surfaces from the right course, &amp; the rest, as they are bigger <a id="l3125"></a>&amp; bigger may make the stronger &amp; more lucid colours, blue green yellow &amp; red 
<a id="l3126"></a>&amp; be more &amp; more difficultly diverted. And lastly the unusual refraction <a id="l3127"></a>of Island Crystal looks very much as if it were performed by some <a id="l3128"></a>kind of  attractive vertue  lodged in certain sides both of the rays &amp; of the particles of the crys<a id="l3129"></a>tall. For were it not for some kind of  disposition or vertue in some sides of the particles <a id="l3130"></a>of the crystal which  is not in their other sides &amp; which inclines &amp; bends the rays towards the coasts of unusual re<a id="l3131"></a>fraction the rays which fall perpendicularly on the crystal would not be refracted towards that coast  rather then towards any other coast, Both at their incidence &amp; at their emergence, so as to emerge perpendicularly by a contrary situation of the coast of unusual refraction at the second surface; the crystal acting upon the rays after they have past through it &amp; are emerging into the air or if you please into a vacuum. And since the crystal by this disposition or <a id="l3133"></a>vertue does not act upon the rays unless when one of their sides of unusual <a id="l3134"></a>refraction are <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">look</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">are</span></span> turned towards that coast this argues a vertue or disposition in those sides <a id="l3135"></a>of the rays which answers to &amp; sympathizes with that vertue or disposition of the <a id="l3136"></a>crystal, as the poles of two Magnets answer one to another. And as <a id="l3137"></a>magnetism  may be intended &amp; remitted &amp; is <a id="l3138"></a>found only in the Magnet &amp; in iron, so this vertue of refracting the <a id="l3139"></a>perpendicular rays is greater in Island Crystal less in Crystal of the <a id="l3140"></a>rock &amp; is not yet found in other bodies. But what ever this vertue be <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p290r"> &lt;290r&gt; </span> tis very difficult to conceive how the rays of light, unless they be bodies, can have <a id="l3141"></a>a permanent vertue in two of their sides opposite one to another which is not in their <a id="l3142"></a>other sides, &amp; this without any dependence on the Medium through which they are <a id="l3143"></a>propagated; the like sides of several rays not looking all towards the same coast <a id="l3144"></a>but being turned several ways before their incidence on the first crystal, &amp; looking indifferently towards any coast as the rays <a id="l3145"></a>happen to be emitted from shining substances in several positions, &amp; according<a id="l3146"></a>ly as they are turned to this or that coast, being refracted at their inci<a id="l3147"></a>dence on the first crystal &amp; again at their emergence out of it some after the usual &amp; some after the unusual <a id="l3148"></a>manner.</p>

And by this proportion I reccon <a id="l3238"></a>the attractive force of rays of light above  ten hundred thousand thousand millions of times greater <a id="l3239"></a>then the  force whereby bodies gravitate on the surface of this earth in proportion to the <a id="l3240"></a>matter in them. supposing that light comes from the Sun to us in about 7 minutes of an hour. And so great a force in the rays  cannot but have a very great effect upon <a id="l3241"></a>the particles of matter with which they are compounded, for causing them  to attract <a id="l3242"></a>one another. Let us therefore see if they  have not such  attractions   </p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p292r"> &lt;292r&gt; </span>
<p id="par259"> Now attraction in bodies of the same kind &amp; vertue is strongest in the smallest bodies  in proportion to their <a id="l3244"></a>bulk. It is found stronger in small magnets for their weight then in great ones.   For the parts of small ones being close together unite their forces more easily. And therefore the <a id="l3245"></a>rays of light being the smallest bodies known to us, we may expect to find  their attraction very strong <a id="l3246"></a>in them. And how strong it is may be gathered  by this Rule. The <a id="l3247"></a>attraction of a ray of light in proportion to its body is to the gravity of a projectile in propor<a id="l3248"></a>tion to its body, as in a compound ratio of the velocity of the ray of light to the velocity of <a id="l3249"></a>the projectile &amp; of the bent of the ray to the bent of the projetile, supposing the</p>
<p id="par260">We have  shewed that the attraction of</p>
<p id="par261">The smallest particles of matter may cohere by the strongest attractions &amp; compose bigger particles <a id="l3250"></a>of weaker vertue &amp;  many of these may cohere &amp; compose a bigger particle whose vertue is <a id="l3251"></a>still weaker &amp; so on for divers successions untill the progression end in the biggest particles on <a id="l3252"></a>which the operations in Chymistry &amp; the colours of natural bodies depend, &amp; which by cohering <a id="l3253"></a> compose bodies of a sensible magnitude.</p>
<p id="par262">Since metals dissolve in acids   attract but a smal quantity of the acid, their <a id="l3254"></a>attractive force can reach but to a small distance  from them. And as in Algebra <a id="l3255"></a>where affirmative quantities vanish &amp; cease, there negative ones begin so in Mecha<a id="l3256"></a>nicks where attraction ceases there a repulsive vertue ought to begin. [By this vertue <a id="l3257"></a>the rays of light are emitted from shining substances &amp; reflected  by the bodies <a id="l3258"></a>they fall upon &amp; in their passage by the sides of bodies they are bent from the body. And by the same <a id="l3259"></a>power the particles of air recede from one another, flys walk upon water without <a id="l3260"></a>wetting their feet, &amp; all dry things are difficultly made to touch one another, &amp; Object <a id="l3261"></a>glasses of long Telescopes laid upon another will scarce touch so as to make the black spot <a id="l3262"></a>appear (as is described in the <span class="hspac-n" title="7 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Observation  the 1<sup>t</sup> part of the second book) unless they <a id="l3263"></a>be pressed together, &amp; when the pressure  ceases the glasses recede from one another.] And <a id="l3264"></a>that there is such a vertue seems to follow from the reflection &amp; inflexion of <a id="l3265"></a>light. For  in both these cases the rays of light are repelled  without the immediate <a id="l3266"></a>contact of the reflecting  or inflecting body. It seems also to follow from the emission of <a id="l3267"></a> light the ray so soon as it is shaken off from a shining body  by the vibrating <a id="l3268"></a>motion of the parts of the body &amp; gets beyond the reach of attraction being driven away with exceeding <a id="l3269"></a>great velocity. For that force which  is great enough to turn it back in reflection may be great enought to <a id="l3270"></a>give it its motion in emission. It seems to follow also from the production of air <a id="l3271"></a>vapour the particles of  bodies when shaken off from the bodies by heat or fermentation, so soon as they <a id="l3272"></a>are beyond the reach of attraction  recede from the bodies &amp; also from one another with <a id="l3273"></a>great strength &amp; keepe at a distance.  The particles of fluids which  do not adhere too strongly to one another &amp; are of such a smallness as <a id="l3274"></a>renders them most susceptible of those agitations which  keep liquor in a fluor, being most easily rarefied, or to use the <a id="l3275"></a>language of the Chemists, being most volatile. These rarefy into vapor by an easy heat &amp; condense  by cold: but <a id="l3276"></a>those which are larger &amp; less susceptible of agitation or cohere by a stronger attraction are not seperated without <a id="l3277"></a>a stronger heat or perhaps not without fermentation. And these last are the bodies which Chemists called fixed &amp; which <a id="l3278"></a>being rarefied become true permanent air; those particles receding from one another with the great<a id="l3279"></a>est force which upon contact cohere most strongly. And because the particles of permanent air are grosser &amp; <a id="l3280"></a>denser then those of vapors, thence it is that true air is more ponderous then vapour &amp; that a moist Atmosphere <a id="l3281"></a>is lighter then a dry one,  quantity for quantity, as <span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span>ned by the Barometer.</p>

<p id="par265"> I have therefor proposed the Question whether the rays of light may not be small <a id="l3291"></a>bodies  emitted by shinning substances.   Certainly the resemblance between them is very great. <a id="l3292"></a>For such bodies will pass through uniform Mediums in right lines without bending <a id="l3293"></a>into the shadow which is the property of the rays of light.  Pellucid substances act upon <a id="l3294"></a>the rays of light at a distance in <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>re<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>fracting reflecting &amp; inflecting them,  &amp; <a id="l3295"></a>the rays mutually agitate the parts of  those substances at a distance for heating them <a id="l3296"></a> &amp; this action &amp; reaction very much resembles an attractive force  If refraction be performed by <a id="l3298"></a>attraction of the rays, the sines of incidence must be to the sines of refraction <a id="l3299"></a>in a given proportion as we shewed in our Principles:  And this Rule is true by experience.  <a id="l3300"></a>If The rays of light in going out of glass  into a vacuum fall too obliquely on the  vacuum they are totally reflected,   which seems to  an attraction of the glass Colours &amp; refractions  depend <a id="l3304"></a>not on new modifications of light but on the original &amp; unchangeable properties of its rays  &amp; such properties are best conserved in bodies projected. Pressions &amp; motions  are apt to receive new modifications in passing through several mediums but the properties of bodies pro<a id="l3307"></a>jected  will scarce be altered  thereby. Nothing more is <a id="l3308"></a>
requisite for the  diversity of colours &amp; degrees of refrangibility <a id="l3309"></a>then  that the rays be bodies of different sizes, the least of which may make violet the <a id="l3310"></a>darkest of colours , &amp; be most easily diverted by refraction from the right course &amp; the <a id="l3311"></a>rest as they are bigger &amp; bigger may make the  more lucid colours blue green <a id="l3312"></a>yellow &amp; red, &amp; be more &amp; more difficultly diverted by the refracting surface. <a id="l3313"></a>And lastly the unusual refraction of Island Crystal looks very much as if it <a id="l3314"></a>was performed by some kind of polar vertue both in the rays &amp; in the <a id="l3315"></a>particles of the crystal. For were it not for some kind of polar vertue in <a id="l3316"></a>the  particles of the crystal  which draws the rays towards the coast of <a id="l3317"></a>unusual refraction the rays would not be refracted towards that coast when <a id="l3318"></a>they fall perpendicularly on the glass. And  since the crystal by this vertue <a id="l3319"></a>does not act upon the rays unless when their sides of unusual refraction are towards <a id="l3320"></a>that coast this argues a virtue in those two sides of the rays which answers to that vertue <a id="l3321"></a>of the  crystal as the poles of two Magnets answer one to another <a id="l3322"></a>And as Magnetism is not found in all bodies &amp; may be intended &amp; remitted so this vertue of refracting the <a id="l3323"></a>perpendicular rays is not found in all refracting substances &amp; is  greater in Island Crystal <a id="l3324"></a>less in Crystal of the rock.  But what ever this vertue <a id="l3325"></a>be tis very difficult to conceive how the rays of light unless they be bodies can have <a id="l3326"></a> a  permanent  vertue in two of their sides opposite one to another which is not in <a id="l3327"></a>their other  sides;   &amp; this without <a id="l3329"></a>any dependance on the  Medium through which they are propagated; the like sides of <a id="l3330"></a>several rays looking towards several coasts before their incidence on the first  crystal, &amp; <a id="l3331"></a>being turned indifferently  towards any coast as the rays happen to be emitted from shining <a id="l3332"></a>substance in several positions, &amp; accordingly as they are turned to this or that being refracted  at their incidence on the first crystal some <a id="l3333"></a>after the unusual &amp; some after the usual manner</p>

<p id="par288">Qu.  17. Are there not other original properties of the rays of light besides those already described? An instance of another  original property we have in the refractions of Island-crys<a id="l3567"></a>tal described first by Erasmus Bartholin &amp; afterwards more exactly <a id="l3568"></a>by Hugenius in his book  De la lumiere.. This crystal is a pellucid fusile stone  clear as water or crystal of the rock &amp; without colour, enduring  a red heat without losing its transparency &amp; in a very strong heat <a id="l3571"></a>calcining without fusion. Steept a day or two in water it loses its natural <a id="l3572"></a>polish. Being rubbed on cloth it attracts pieces of straws &amp; other light things <a id="l3573"></a>like Ambar or glass: &amp; with Aqua fortis its makes an ebullition.

It cleaves easily in planes parallel to any of its sides &amp; no<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>t<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3579"></a>in any other planes. It cleaves with a glossy polite surface not perfectly <a id="l3580"></a>plane but with some little uneavenness. It is easily scratcht  &amp; by reason of its softness it takes a polish very difficultly. It polishes better <a id="l3582"></a>upon polished looking-glass then upon metal &amp; perhaps better upon pitch <a id="l3583"></a>leather or parchment. Afterwards it must be rubbed with a little oyle or white of <a id="l3584"></a>an egg to fill up its scratches: whereby it will become very transparent <a id="l3585"></a>&amp; polite. But for several experiments it is not necessary to polish <a id="l3586"></a>it. If a piece of this crystalline stone be laid upon a book every <a id="l3587"></a>letter of the book seen through it will appear double by means <a id="l3588"></a>of a double refraction. And if any beam of light falls either perpendicu<a id="l3589"></a>larly or in any angle upon any surface of this crystal it becomes <a id="l3590"></a>divided into two beams by means of the same double refraction. Which beams are of the same colour with the incident beam of light &amp; seem equal to one another in the quantity of their light or very nearly equal. One of these refractions is <a id="l3591"></a>One of these refractions is performed by the usual Rule of Opticks, <a id="l3592"></a>the sine of incidence out of Air into this Crystal being to the <a id="l3593"></a>sine of refraction as five to three. The other refraction, which may <a id="l3594"></a>be called the unusuall refraction, is performed by the following Rule.</p>
<p id="par289">Let ADBC represent the refracting surface of the Crystal, C the <a id="l3595"></a>biggest solid angle at that surface, GEHF the opposite surface &amp; CK <a id="l3596"></a>a perpendicular on that surface. This perpendicular makes with the <a id="l3597"></a> edge of the crystal CF an angle of 19<sup>deg.</sup> 3′. Joyne KF &amp; in it <a id="l3598"></a>take KL so that the angle KCL be 6<sup>deg</sup> 40′ &amp; the angle LCF 12<sup>deg.</sup> <a id="l3599"></a>23′. And if ST represent any beam of light incident at T in any <a id="l3600"></a>angle upon the refracting surface ADBC, let TV be the refracted <a id="l3601"></a>beam determined by the given proportion of the sines 5 to 3 according <a id="l3602"></a>to the usual rule of Opticks.

<p id="par291">In like manner Crystal of the rock has a double refraction: but the <a id="l3614"></a>difference of the two refractions is not so great &amp; manifest as in Island <a id="l3615"></a>Crystal.</p>


<p id="par294">When the beam ST incident on Island Crystal <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p298r"> &lt;298r&gt; </span> is divided into two beams TV &amp; TX &amp; these two beams arrive at the <a id="l3622"></a>further surface of the glass, the beam TV which was refracted at the <a id="l3623"></a>first surface after the usual manner, shall be again refracted <a id="l3624"></a>entirely after the usual manner at the second surface &amp; the beam <a id="l3625"></a>TX which was refracted after the un-usual manner in the first surface <a id="l3626"></a>shall be again refracted entirely after the unusual manner in <a id="l3627"></a>the second surface, so that both these beams shall emerge out of <a id="l3628"></a>the second surface in lines parallel to the first incident beam ST.</p>
<p id="par295">And if two pieces of Island Crystal be placed one after another in such manner <a id="l3629"></a>that all the surfaces of the latter be parallel to all the corresponding surfaces of the <a id="l3630"></a>former: the rays which are refracted after the usual manner in the first surface <a id="l3631"></a>of the first crystal shall be refracted after the usual manner in all the follow<a id="l3632"></a>ing surfaces &amp; the rays which are refracted after the unusual manner in the <a id="l3633"></a>first surface shall be refracted after the unusual manner in all the following <a id="l3634"></a>surfaces. And the same thing happens tho the surfaces of the Crystalls be any <a id="l3635"></a> ways inclined to one another  provided their planes of perpendicular refraction be parallel to one another. </p>
<p id="par296">And therefore there is an original difference in the rays of light by means of which some <a id="l3638"></a> rays are in this experiment constantly refracted after the usual manner &amp;  others  <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>are<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3639"></a>constantly after the unusual manner.  For if the difference be not original but arises from new modifications  imprest on the rays  at their first refraction, it would be altered by new modifications in the three following refractions: whereas it suffers no alteration but is constant &amp; has the same effect upon the  rays in all the refracti<a id="l3642"></a> ons. The unusual refraction is therefore performed by an original property of the rays. And it remains to be enquired whether the rays have not more original properties then are yet discovered.</p>
<p id="par297">Qu. 18. Have not the rays of light  several sides endued with several original  properties? <a id="l3646"></a>For if the planes of perpendicular refraction of the second  crystal be <a id="l3647"></a>at right angles with the planes of perpendicular refraction of the first <a id="l3648"></a> crystal the rays which are refracted after the usual manner in passing <a id="l3649"></a>through the first  crystal will be all of them refracted after the unusuall <a id="l3650"></a>manner in passing through the second  crystal &amp; the rays which are refrac<a id="l3651"></a>ted after the unusuall manner in  passing through the first <a id="l3652"></a> crystal will all of them be refracted after the usual manner in <a id="l3653"></a>passing through the second  crystal. And therefore there are not two sorts <a id="l3654"></a>of rays differing in their nature from one another, one of which is constantly <a id="l3655"></a>&amp; in all positions refracted after the usual manner &amp; the other con<a id="l3656"></a>stantly &amp; in all positions after the unusuall manner. The difference <a id="l3657"></a>between the two sorts of rays in the  experiment mentioned in the 19<sup>th</sup> Question was only in <a id="l3658"></a>the positions of the sides of the rays to the  <a id="l3659"></a>planes of perpendicular refraction . For one &amp; the same ray is here refracted <a id="l3660"></a>sometimes after the usual &amp; sometimes after the unusual manner ac<a id="l3661"></a>cording to the position which its sides have to the  crystalls.

There is <a id="l3668"></a>nothing more required to determin whether the rays which fall upon the second crystal shall <a id="l3669"></a>be refracted after the usual or after the unusual manner but to turn about <a id="l3670"></a>this crystall so that the coast of this crystalls unusual refraction may be on this or <a id="l3671"></a>that side of the ray.

 by the same laws in  all <a id="l3682"></a>the four surfaces,   it appears that those dispositions were in the the rays originally &amp; suffered no alteration by the first refraction &amp; that by means <a id="l3684"></a>of those dispositions the rays were refracted  at their incidence <a id="l3685"></a>on the first surface of the first crystal some of them after the usual <a id="l3686"></a>&amp; some of them after the unusual manner accordingly as their sides of <a id="l3687"></a>usual or unusual refraction were then turned towards the coast of the unusual <a id="l3688"></a>refraction  of that crystal. </p>
<p id="par298">✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the middle of f 298v &gt; </span>✝Every ray of light has therefore two opposite sides originally endued with <a id="l3689"></a>a property on which the unusual refraction depends &amp; other two opposite sides <a id="l3690"></a>not endued with that property.

<p id="par299">In explaining the difference of the sides of the rays above mentioned <a id="l3693"></a>I have supposed that the rays fall perpendicularly on the first crystal. <a id="l3694"></a>But if they fall obliquely on it the success is the same.

<p id="par302">Qu. 19. Are not all Hypotheses erroneous which have hitherto been invented <a id="l3780"></a>for explaining the phenomena of light by new modifications of the rays. For <a id="l3781"></a> those phenomena  depend not <a id="l3784"></a>upon new modifications, as has been supposed but upon the original &amp; unchangeable proper<a id="l3785"></a>ties of the rays.</p>
<p id="par303">Qu. 20. Are not all Hypotheses erroneous in which light is supposed <a id="l3786"></a>to consist in pression or motion propagated through a fluid Medium? <a id="l3787"></a>For in all these Hypothese the phænomena of light have been hitherto <a id="l3788"></a>explained by supposing that they arise from new modifications of the <a id="l3789"></a>rays: which is an erroneous supposition.</p>
<p id="par304">If light consisted only in pression propagated without actual motion<a id="l3790"></a>it would not be able to agitate &amp; heat the bodies which refract &amp; reflect <a id="l3791"></a>it. If it consisted in motion propagated to all distances in an instant, it would <a id="l3792"></a>require an infinite force every moment in every shining particle to generate <a id="l3793"></a>that motion. And if it consisted in  pression or motion propagated  either in an instant or in time it would bend into the shadow. For pression or <a id="l3795"></a>motion cannot be propagated in a fluid in right lines beyond an obstacle <a id="l3796"></a>which stops part of the motion, but will bend &amp; spread every way into the <a id="l3797"></a>quiescent medium which lyes beyond the obstacle. Gravity tends downwards, <a id="l3798"></a>but the pressure of water arising from Gravity tends every way with <a id="l3799"></a>equal force &amp; is propagated as readily &amp; with as much force through <a id="l3800"></a>crooked passages as through streight ones. The waves on the surface of <a id="l3801"></a>water passing by the sides of a broad obstacle bend &amp; dilate themselves <a id="l3802"></a> gradualy into the quiet water behind the obstacle. The waves <a id="l3803"></a>pulses or vibrations of the Air wherein sounds consist bend manifestly, <a id="l3804"></a>tho not so much as the waves of water. For a Bell or a Canon may be <a id="l3805"></a>heard beyond a hill which intercepts the sight of the sounding body, &amp; <a id="l3806"></a>sounds are propagated as readily through crooked pipes as through streight <a id="l3807"></a>ones. But light is never known to follow crooked passages nor to bend into <a id="l3808"></a>the shadow. For the fixt stars by the interposition of any of the Planets <a id="l3809"></a>cease to be seen, &amp; so do the parts of the Sun by the interposition of the <a id="l3810"></a>Moon Mercury or Venus. The rays which pass very near to the edges <a id="l3811"></a>of any body are bent a little by the action of the body as we shewed <a id="l3812"></a>above, but this bending is not towards but from the shadow &amp; is per<a id="l3813"></a>formed only in the passage of the ray by the body &amp; at a very small distance from it.. So soon as the <a id="l3814"></a>ray is past the body, it goes right on.</p>
<p id="par305">To explain the unusual refraction of Island Crystal by pression or motion pro<a id="l3815"></a>pagated has not hitherto been attempted (to my knowledge) except by Hugenius who <a id="l3816"></a>for that end supposed two several vibrating Mediums within that Crystal. But <a id="l3817"></a>when he tried the refractions in two  successive pieces of that <a id="l3818"></a>crystal &amp; found them such as is mentioned above: he confessed himself at <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p301r"> &lt;301r&gt; </span> a loss for explaining them. For pressions or motions propagated from a <a id="l3819"></a>shining body through an uniform Medium must be on all sides alike: whereas <a id="l3820"></a>by those experiments it appears that the rays of light have different properties <a id="l3821"></a>in their different sides. He  suspected that the pulses of Æther in passing <a id="l3822"></a>through the first crystal might receive certain new modifications which <a id="l3823"></a>might determin them to be propagated in this or that Medium within the <a id="l3824"></a>second crystal according to the position of <a id="l3825"></a>that crystal, but what modifications those <a id="l3826"></a>might be he could not say nor think of <a id="l3827"></a>any thing satisfactory in that point.<sup class="note" id="n2-ref">[2]</sup> And <a id="l3828"></a>if had known that the unusual refraction depends not on new modifications but <a id="l3829"></a>on the original &amp; unchangeable dispositions of the rays, he would have found it <a id="l3830"></a>as difficult to explain how those dispositions which he supposed to be imprest on the <a id="l3831"></a>rays by the first Crystal could be in them before their incidence on that Crystal, &amp; <a id="l3832"></a>in general how all rays emitted by shining bodies can have those dispositions in <a id="l3833"></a>them from the beginning. To me at least this seems inexplicable if light be <a id="l3834"></a>nothing else then  pression or motion propagated through Æther.</p>
<p id="par306">And it is as difficult to explain by these Hypotheses how rays can be <a id="l3835"></a>alternately in fits of easy reflexion &amp; easy transmission; unless perhaps one <a id="l3836"></a>might suppose that there are in all space two ethereal vibrating Mediums <a id="l3837"></a>&amp; that the vibrations of one of them constitute light &amp; that the vibrations <a id="l3838"></a>of the other being swifter, as often as they overtake the vibrations of <a id="l3839"></a>the first, put them into those fits. But to allow two æthers where <a id="l3840"></a>we have no evidence for so much as one, to suppose that two æthers <a id="l3841"></a>may be together in all spaces without mixing with one another so <a id="l3842"></a>as to become one Medium &amp; to suppose also that they may have distinct <a id="l3843"></a>vibrations without making two sorts of light, are difficulties which I <a id="l3844"></a>cannot get over. And that there are no such fluid Mediums I gather by <a id="l3845"></a>the  regular &amp; very lasting motions of Planets &amp; Co<a id="l3846"></a>mets through the heavens in all manner of positions: For hence it <a id="l3847"></a>is manifest that the heavens are void of all sensible resistance, &amp; <a id="l3848"></a>by consequence of all sensible matter.</p>
<p id="par307">For the resisting power of fluid Mediums arises partly from the attrition <a id="l3849"></a>of the parts of the Medium &amp; partly from the Vis inertiæ of the matter. <a id="l3850"></a>That part of the resistance of a spherical body which arises from the <a id="l3851"></a>attrition of the parts of the Medium is as the factum of the diameter <a id="l3852"></a>&amp; the velocity of the spherical body very nearly &amp; that part of the resistance which <a id="l3853"></a>arises from the Vis inertiæ of the matter is as the square of that factum. <a id="l3854"></a>And by this  difference the two sorts of resistance may be distinguished from <a id="l3855"></a>one another in any Medium &amp; being distinguished it will be found that almost all the resis<a id="l3856"></a>tance of bodies of a competent magnitude moveing in Air Water &amp; Quicksilver <a id="l3857"></a>&amp; such like fluids with a competent velocity arises from the Vis inertiæ of the parts of the fluid. <a id="l3858"></a></p>
<p id="par308"> Now that part of the resisting  power of any Medium which arises <a id="l3864"></a>from the tenacity or attrition of the parts of the Medium may be diminished by dividing </p>

<p id="par336">Qu. 23. By what means do  bodies act on one another at a distance. <a id="l4055"></a>The ancient Philosophers who held Atoms &amp; Vacuum attributed gravity to Atoms <a id="l4056"></a>without telling us the means unless perhaps in figures: as by calling God Har<a id="l4057"></a>mony &amp;  representing him &amp; matter by the God Pan &amp; his Pipe, or by calling the <a id="l4058"></a>Sun the prison of Jupiter because he keeps the Planets in their orbs. Whence it <a id="l4059"></a>seems to have been an ancient opinion that matter depends upon a Deity <a id="l4060"></a>for its laws of motion as well as for its existence. The Cartesians make God the <a id="l4061"></a>author of all motion &amp; its as reasonable to make him the author of  <a id="l4062"></a>the laws of motion. Matter is a passive principle &amp; cannot move it self. <a id="l4063"></a>It continues in its state of moving or resting unless disturbed. It receives motion <a id="l4064"></a>proportional to the force impressing it. And resists as much as it is resisted. <a id="l4065"></a>These are passive laws &amp; to affirm that there are no other is to speak against <a id="l4066"></a>experience. For we find in our selves a power of moving our bodies by our <a id="l4067"></a>thought Life &amp;  will are active Principles by which we move our bodies, &amp; thence arise other laws of motion unknown to us.</p>
<p id="par337">And since all matter duly formed is attended with signes of life &amp; all   <a id="l4068"></a>things are framed with perfect  art &amp; wisdom &amp; Nature does nothing in vain; if there <a id="l4069"></a>be an universal life &amp; all space be the sensorium of a thinking being  who by immediate presence perceives all things in it as that which thinks in us <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">perceives</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">see</span></span> their pictures in the brain: the laws of <a id="l4073"></a>motion arising from life or will may be of universal extent.</p>
<p id="par338">— those laws.

<p id="par340">And While these powers are of so large extent, I do not see but that they may be num<a id="l4101"></a>bred among the general laws of motion. The Vis inertiæ is a passive principle by which bodies persist <a id="l4102"></a>in their  motion or rest, receive motion in proportion to the force impressing it &amp; resist  as much as they are resisted: By this principle alone there could never have been any motion in the world.

<p id="par341">But while I call those forces attraction &amp; repulse I would not be understood to define the <a id="l4109"></a>cause or manner of the action.

<p id="par342">I have hitherto been arguing from the effects to their causes &amp;  carried <a id="l4115"></a>the argument  up to  certain forces by which little bodies act on one another at small <a id="l4116"></a>distances. These forces may be recconed among the laws of motion,   but whether they depend on  Bodies alone considered only a long broad &amp; thick bodies alone may be a question For are passive.  By their vis inertiæ they continue in their state of moving or <a id="l4118"></a>resting &amp; receive motion proportional to the force impressing it &amp;  resiste as much as <a id="l4119"></a>they  are resisted, but they cannot move themselves; &amp; without some other principle <a id="l4120"></a>then the vis inertiæ there could be no motion in the world.  And if there be another Principle of motion there must be other laws of motion <a id="l4123"></a> depending on that Principle. And the first thing to be done in Philosophy is to find out all <a id="l4124"></a>the general laws of motion  on which the frame of nature depends. <a id="l4125"></a> We find in our selves <a id="l4127"></a>a power of moving our bodies by our thoughts ] &amp; see the same power in other living creatures but  how this is done &amp; by what laws we do not know.   We cannot say that all Nature is not alive.   not know her laws or powers any <a id="l4136"></a>further then we gather them from Phænomena. </p>

<p id="par346">What I mean  in this Question by a Vacuum, &amp; the attractions of the  rays of light  <a id="l4149"></a> towards the glass or crystall, may be understood by  what was said in the <a id="l4150"></a>18<sup>th</sup> Question.</p>
<p id="par347">Now in bodies — — — — — forces more easily. And for the like reason Gravity in <a id="l4151"></a>the surfaces of small globes is greater in proportion to the globes then in <a id="l4152"></a>the surfaces of great globes of equal density. And therefore since the rays <a id="l4153"></a>of light are the smallest bodies yet known to us (For I do not here consider <a id="l4154"></a>the particles of æther) we may expect to find their attractions very <a id="l4155"></a>strong.

<p id="par348">As attraction is stronger in small magnets then in great ones in proportion <a id="l4159"></a>to their bulk, &amp; gravity is greater in the surfaces of small Planets then  in those of great <a id="l4160"></a>ones in proportion to their bulk so the smallness of the rays of light may very much <a id="l4161"></a>contribute to the force by which they are refracted.

<p id="par349">And that the gravity of the Planets towards the Sun may not be thought too <a id="l4166"></a>great  to be produced by the cause of gravity here  suggested: upon a fair computation it will <a id="l4167"></a>found that the gravity of our earth towards the Sun in proportion to the <a id="l4168"></a>quantity of its matter is above ten hundred millions of millions of millions <a id="l4169"></a>of millions of times less then  the force by which a ray of light in entring <a id="l4170"></a>into glass or crystall is drawn or f<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>orced<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> impelled towards the refracting body.

<p id="par358">If two plane polished plates of glass three or four inches broad &amp; about twenty long <a id="l4218"></a>be laid  one of them parallel to the horizon the other upon the first so as to <a id="l4219"></a>touch it &amp; make an angle with it.   of about 10 or 15 minutes at one of their ends &amp; the same be first <a id="l4220"></a>moistened on their inward sides with a cleane cloth dipt into oyle of Oranges, &amp; rubbed upon it &amp; a drop or two of the oyle <a id="l4221"></a>be let fall upon he lower glass at the other end: so soon as the upper glass <a id="l4222"></a>is laid down upon the lower so as to touch it at one end &amp; to touch the drop at <a id="l4223"></a>the other end  making with the lower glass an angle of about 10 or 15 <a id="l4224"></a>as above; the drop will begin to move towards the concourse of the glasses  &amp; <a id="l4225"></a>will continue to move with an accelerated motion till it arrives at that con<a id="l4226"></a>course of the glasses.  [And if  you then open the glasses <a id="l4227"></a>where they met &amp; touched &amp; make them  meet &amp; touch at their other end in the <a id="l4228"></a>same acute angle as before; the  drop will run back  to that end of the <a id="l4229"></a>glasses where they now touch, &amp; where it was at first.]  For the two <a id="l4230"></a>glasses attract the drop, &amp;  by the attraction make it run that way <a id="l4231"></a>towards which the attractions  incline. And if when the drop is in motion <a id="l4232"></a>you lift up that end of the glasses where they meet &amp; towards which <a id="l4233"></a>the drop  moves: the drop will ascend between the glasses, &amp; <a id="l4234"></a>therefore is attracted. And  as you lift up the glasses, more &amp; more the drop will ascend <a id="l4235"></a>slower &amp; slower &amp; at length rest.  And when you see it rest you may reccon that it then <a id="l4236"></a>carried downward by its weight as much as upwards by the attraction. And <a id="l4237"></a>thereby you may know the force by which the drop is attracted at all distances <a id="l4238"></a>from the  contact of the glasses. And  by some experi<a id="l4239"></a>ments, the attraction is almost reciprocally as  in a duplicate proportion of the distance <a id="l4240"></a>of the  <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>middle<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of the drop from the concours of the glasses.    viz reciprocally in a <a id="l4247"></a>simple proportion  by reason of the spreading of <a id="l4248"></a>the drop &amp; its touching the glasses in alarger surface; &amp; again reciprocally <a id="l4249"></a>in a  simple proportion by reason of the attractions growing stronger within <a id="l4250"></a>the same quantity of  attracting surface. The attraction therefore <a id="l4251"></a>within the same quantity of surface is reciprocally as the distance between <a id="l4252"></a>the glasses. And therefore where the distance is very small, suppose the <a id="l4253"></a>ten-thousand-thousandth part of an inch, the attraction must be exceeding <a id="l4254"></a>great; so  great perhaps as within in a circle of an inch in diameter to  suffice to hold up a <a id="l4255"></a> weight equal to a cylinder of water <a id="l4256"></a>of an inch in diameter, &amp;  above a mile in length. There are therefore   Agents in Nature able to to make the particles of bodies attract <a id="l4258"></a>one another very strongly &amp; to stick together strongly those by  attractions. One of those <a id="l4259"></a> Agents may be the Æther above mentioned whereby light is refracted. Another <a id="l4260"></a>may be the Agent or Spirit which causes electrical attraction. For tho this Agent <a id="l4261"></a>acts not at great distances  except when it is excited by the friction of electrick bodies: <a id="l4262"></a>yet it may act perpetually at very small distances  without friction, &amp; that not only in   bodies accounted electric, but also in some others. And  there <a id="l4264"></a>are still other mediums which may cause attractions, (such as are the Magnetick effluvia; <a id="l4265"></a> it is the business of experimental Philosophy to  find out all these Medi<a id="l4266"></a>ums with their properties.</p>
<p id="par359">Now the smallest particles of matter may cohere</p>
<p id="par360">By the Table in the second part of the second Book  wherein the thicknesses <a id="l4267"></a>of  coloured plates of water  between two <a id="l4268"></a>glasses are set down, the thickness of the plate where it  appears very black is <a id="l4269"></a>three eighths of the thousand-thousandth part of an inch. And where the Oyle <a id="l4270"></a>of Oranges between the glasses is of this thickness, the attraction seems <a id="l4271"></a>to be so strong as within a circle of an inch in diameter to suffice to hold <a id="l4272"></a>up a weight equal to that of a cylinder of water of an inch in diameter &amp; two or three furlongs in lenghth <a id="l4273"></a>And where it is of a less thickness the attraction   may be proportionally greater. <a id="l4274"></a>&amp; increase untill the thickness be no bigger then that of a single particle of water.</p>

<p id="par362">The parts — — — — any sensible effect. All bodies — — — — difficult to conceive <a id="l4277"></a>The same thing — — — — cohesion of its parts. It is not therefore by the  pressure <a id="l4278"></a>of the Æther upon the outside of the Marbles or Mercury (tho such a pressure may <a id="l4279"></a>contribute to the effect) but by the action of either that or some other Medium or <a id="l4280"></a>Mediums upon the inward parts of those bodies by which the contiguous parts of the <a id="l4281"></a>Marbles  &amp; those of the glass &amp; Mercury stick to one another. <a id="l4282"></a>The like Experiment hath been tried with water — — — — amongst themselves.</p>
<p id="par363">And of the same kind with these Experiments  are those <a id="l4283"></a>that follow. If two plane polished plates of glass (suppose two pieces of a broken <a id="l4284"></a>looking-glass) bee laid together so that their  sides be  parallel <a id="l4285"></a>&amp; at a very small distance from one another; &amp; then their lower edges be <a id="l4286"></a>dipped into water; the water will rise up between them. And the less the <a id="l4287"></a>distance of the glasses is  the greater will be the height to which the water <a id="l4288"></a>will rise.  If the distance be about the   hundreth part of an inch, the <a id="l4289"></a>water will rise to the light of about an inch &amp; if the distance be greater or <a id="l4290"></a>less in any proportion, the height will be  reciprocally <a id="l4291"></a>proportional to the distance very nearly.  For the attractive force of the glasses is the same whether the distance between them be greater or  less &amp; the weight of the water  drawn up is the same if the height of it be reciprocally proportional to the distance between the glasses. [And in like manner water ascends between two Marbles polished plane, when their polished sides are parallel , &amp; at a very little distance from one another.] And if slender pipes of glass be <a id="l4294"></a>dipt at one end into stagnating water the water will rise  up within the <a id="l4295"></a>pipe &amp; the hight to which it rises will be reciprocally proportional to the <a id="l4296"></a>diameter of the  cavity of the pipe &amp; will equall the height <a id="l4297"></a>to which it rises between two   planes of glass if the semidiameter of the cavity <a id="l4298"></a>of the Pipe be equal to the distance  between the planes,  or thereabouts. And <a id="l4299"></a>these experiments suceed after the same manner in vacuo as in the open <a id="l4300"></a>air, &amp; therefore are not influenced by the weight or pressure of the <a id="l4301"></a>Atmosphere.</p>
<p id="par364">And if a wide pipe of glass be filled with sifted ashes well pressed together in the glass &amp; <a id="l4302"></a>one end of the pipe be dipped into stagnating water; the water will rise up slowly in <a id="l4303"></a>the glass so as in the space of a week or afortnight to reach  up to 30 or 40 <a id="l4304"></a>inches above the surface of the stagnating water. And  the <a id="l4305"></a>water is raised to this height by the attraction of those particles of the ashes only which are upon <a id="l4306"></a>the surface of the elevated water;  the particles  which are  within the water, attrac<a id="l4307"></a>ting it as much downwards as upwards. And therefore the attraction is very strong <a id="l4308"></a> but it would be much stronger  if the ashes  upon the surface of the <a id="l4309"></a>attracted water were one continued body, as the glass is which keeps quicksilver sus<a id="l4310"></a>pended  to the hight of above 60 or 70 inches,  &amp; therefore attracts <a id="l4311"></a>with a force which would keep water suspended to the height of above fifty feet. And the particles of glass, which lie closer to one another then they  do or the quicksilver <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>mor<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> attracts one another with a force much stronger.</p>
