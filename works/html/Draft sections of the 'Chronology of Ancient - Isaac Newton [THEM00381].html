<p id="par3">For in those days the writing of the Thebans &amp; <a id="l89"></a>Ethiopians was in hieroglyphicks. And this way of writ<a id="l90"></a>ing seems to have spread into the lower Egypt before <a id="l91"></a>the days of Moses. For thence came the worship of <a id="l92"></a>their Gods in the various shapes of birds beasts &amp; fishes <a id="l93"></a>forbidden in the second commandment. Now this em<a id="l94"></a>blematical way of writing gave occasion to the Thebans <a id="l95"></a>&amp; Ethiopians who in the days of Samuel David Solomon <a id="l96"></a>&amp; Rhehobam conquered Egypt &amp; the nations round <a id="l97"></a>about &amp; erected a great Empire, to represent &amp; sig<a id="l98"></a>nify their conquering Kings &amp; Princes not by writing <a id="l99"></a>down their names but by making various hieroglyphi<a id="l100"></a>cal figures; as by painting Ammon with Ramms horns <a id="l101"></a>to signify the king who conquered Libya a country <a id="l102"></a>abounding with sheep, his father Amosis with a sith to <a id="l103"></a>signify that king who conquered the lower Egypt a coun<a id="l104"></a>try abounding with corn, his son Osiris by an Ox because he <a id="l105"></a>taught the conquered nations to plow with oxen, &amp; Bacchus <a id="l106"></a>with bulls horns for the same reason, &amp; with grapes because <a id="l107"></a>he taught the nations to plant vines &amp; upon a Tiger because <a id="l108"></a>he  subdued India; Orus the son of Osiris with a harp to <a id="l109"></a>signify the Prince who was eminently skilled on that instrument; <a id="l110"></a>Iupiter upon an Eagle to signify the sublimity of his dominion, <a id="l111"></a>&amp; with a thunderbolt to represent him a warrior; Venus in a <a id="l112"></a>chariot drawn with two Doves to represent her amorous &amp; lust<a id="l113"></a>full; Neptune with a Trident to signify the commander of a fleet <a id="l114"></a>composed of three squadrons; Thoth with a dogs head &amp; wings at <a id="l115"></a>his cap &amp; feet &amp; a Caduceus writhen about with two serpents to signify a man of craft &amp; an Embassador who <a id="l116"></a>reconciled two contending nations; Pan with a pipe &amp; the leggs of <a id="l117"></a>a Goat to signify a man delighted in piping and dancing; &amp; Hercules <a id="l118"></a>with pillars &amp; a club because Sesostris set up pillars in all his <a id="l119"></a>conquests &amp; in the reign of his father Ammon fought against the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p003r"> &lt;3r&gt; </span> Libyans with clubs.

This is that Hercules who <a id="l122"></a>(according to <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n8-ref">[8]</sup> Eudoxus) was slain by Typhos, &amp;  (according <a id="l124"></a>to <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n9-ref">[9]</sup> Ptolomæus Hephæstion) was called Nilus, &amp; who conquered <a id="l125"></a>Gerion with his three sons in Spain &amp; set up the famous pillars <a id="l126"></a>at the straits mouth called Hercules his pillars. For <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n10-ref">[10]</sup> Diodorus <a id="l127"></a> mentioning three Hercules, the Egyptian the Tyrian &amp; the <a id="l128"></a>son of Alcmena, saith that the oldest  flourished among <a id="l129"></a>the Egyptians, &amp; having conquered a great part of the <a id="l130"></a>world, set up the pillar in Afric.

Strabo <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> tells us that the Ethiopians called Megabares <a id="l136"></a>fought with clubs. And some of the Greeks did so till the times <a id="l137"></a>of the Trojan war. Now from this Hieroglyphical way of writing <a id="l138"></a>it came to pass that upon the division of Egypt into Nomes <a id="l139"></a>by Sesostris, the great men of the kingdom to whom the Nomes <a id="l140"></a>were dedicated were represented in their sepulchres, or Temples <a id="l141"></a>of the Nomes by various hieroglyphicks as by an Ox, a Cat, <a id="l142"></a>a Dog, a Cebus, a Goat, a Lyon, a Scarabæus, an Ichneumen, <a id="l143"></a>a Crocodile, a Hippopotamus, an Oxyrinchus, an Ibis, a Crow, <a id="l144"></a>a Hawke, a Leek, &amp; were worshipped by the Nomes in the <a id="l145"></a>shape of these creatures.</p>

<p id="par5"><sup class="note" id="n19-ref">[19]</sup>The Atlantides related that Ouranus was their <a id="l183"></a>first king &amp; reduced them from a salvage course of <a id="l184"></a>life &amp; caused them to dwell in towns &amp; cities &amp; to use &amp; <a id="l185"></a>lay up the fruits of the earth &amp; that he reigned over <a id="l186"></a>a great part of the world &amp; by his wife Titæa had <a id="l187"></a>eighteen children among which were Hyperion &amp; Basilea <a id="l188"></a>the parents of Helio &amp; Selene; that the brother of Hy<a id="l189"></a>perion slew him &amp; drowned his son Helio in the Nile, &amp; di<a id="l190"></a>vided his kingdom amongst themselves; &amp; the country bordering <a id="l191"></a>upon the ocean fell by lot to Atlas, from whom the people <a id="l192"></a>were called Atlantides. By Vranus Hyperion, Basilea, Helio <a id="l193"></a>&amp; Selene I understand Ammon, Osiris, Isis, Orus and <a id="l194"></a>Bubaste. And by the sharing of the kingdom of Hyperion <a id="l195"></a>among his brothers the Titans, I understand the division <a id="l196"></a>of the earth among the Gods mentioned in the poem of Solon.</p>
<p id="par6">For Solon having travelled into Egypt &amp; conversed with <a id="l197"></a>the Priests of Sais about their antiquities, wrote a poem of <a id="l198"></a>what he had learnt, but did not finish it. And this Poem fell into <a id="l199"></a>the hands of Plato,<sup class="note" id="n20-ref">[20]</sup> out of it that at the mouth <a id="l201"></a>of the straits near Hercules pillars, there was an island <a id="l202"></a>called Atlantis, the people of which nine thousand years before <a id="l203"></a>the days of Solon reigned over Libya as far as Egypt &amp; over <a id="l204"></a>Europe as far as the Tyrrhene sea. And all this force collected <a id="l205"></a>into one body invaded Egypt &amp; Greece &amp; whatever was conteined <a id="l206"></a>within the pillars of Hercules but was resisted &amp; stopt by the Athenians &amp; other Greeks, &amp; thereby the rest of the nations <a id="l207"></a>not yet conquered, were preserved. He saith also that in those <a id="l208"></a>days the Gods [having finished their conquests] divided the <a id="l209"></a>whole earth amongst themselves partly into larger partly into <a id="l210"></a>smaller portions &amp; instituted Temples &amp; sacred rites to them<a id="l211"></a>selves, &amp; that the island of  Atlantis fell to the lot of <a id="l212"></a>Neptune who made his eldest son Atlas king of the whole <a id="l213"></a>island, a part of which was called Gadir, &amp; that in the histo<a id="l214"></a>ry of the said wars mention was made of Cecrops, Erechtheus <a id="l215"></a>Erechthonius, Erisichthon &amp; others before Theseus, &amp; also <a id="l216"></a>of the weomen who warred with the men &amp; of the habit <a id="l217"></a>&amp; statue of Minerva, the study of war in those days being <a id="l218"></a>common to men &amp; weomen. By all these circumstances it <a id="l219"></a>is manifest that these Gods were the <em class="underline">Dij magni majorum <a id="l220"></a>gentium</em> &amp; lived between the age of Cecrops &amp;  <a id="l221"></a>Theseus, &amp; that the wars which Sesostris made upon the <a id="l222"></a>nations by sea &amp; land &amp; the resistance he met with in <a id="l223"></a>Greece, &amp; the following invasion of Egypt by Neptune, are <a id="l224"></a>here described, &amp; how the captains of Sesostris shared his <a id="l225"></a>conquests amongst themselves as the captains of Alexander <a id="l226"></a>the great did his conquests long after: &amp; instituting Temples <a id="l227"></a>&amp; Priests &amp; sacred rites to themselves caused the nations to <a id="l228"></a>worship them after death as Gods: &amp; that the island Gadir <a id="l229"></a>or Gades with all Libya as far as Egypt fell to the lot of <a id="l230"></a>him who after death was deified by the name of Neptune. <a id="l231"></a>For in that island Homer<sup class="note" id="n21-ref">[21]</sup> places Calypso the daughter of Atlas <a id="l233"></a>presently after the Trojan war, when Vlysses being shipwrackt <a id="l234"></a>escaped thither. Homer calls it the Ogygian island, &amp; places <a id="l235"></a>it 18 or 20 days sail westward from Pheacia or Corcyra: &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p005r"> &lt;5r&gt; </span> so many days sail Gades is from Corcyra, recconing with <a id="l236"></a>the ancients a thousand stadia to a days sail. This island is <a id="l237"></a>by Homer described a small one destitute of shipping &amp; cities <a id="l238"></a>&amp; inhabited only by Calypso &amp; her weomen who dwelt in a cave <a id="l239"></a>in the midst of a wood, there being no men in the island to <a id="l240"></a>assist Vlysses in building a  new ship, &amp; to accompany <a id="l241"></a>him thence. And the time when the Gods made war &amp; shared <a id="l242"></a>the earth &amp; caused themselves to be worshipped as Gods, is by <a id="l243"></a>Solon limited to the age of Neptune the father of Atlas <a id="l244"></a>&amp; grandfather of Calypso, &amp; so was but two generations <a id="l245"></a>before the destruction of Troy. This is that Neptune who <a id="l246"></a>with Apollo or Orus, fortified Troy with a wall in the <a id="l247"></a>reign of Laomedon the father of Priamus, &amp; left many natural <a id="l248"></a>children in Greece some of which were Argonauts &amp; others <a id="l249"></a>were contemporary to the Argonauts; &amp; therefore he flou<a id="l250"></a>rished one generation before the Argonautic Expedition, &amp; by <a id="l251"></a>consequence about 400 years before Solon went into Egypt. <a id="l252"></a>But the Priests of Egypt in those 400 years had magnified <a id="l253"></a>the stories &amp; antiquity of their Gods so exceedingly as to <a id="l254"></a>make them nine thousand years older then Solon, &amp; the <a id="l255"></a>island of Atlantis bigger then all Afric &amp; Asia together, <a id="l256"></a>&amp; full of people. And because in the days of Solon this <a id="l257"></a>great island did not appear they pretended that it was sunk <a id="l258"></a>into the sea with all its people. Thus great was the vanity <a id="l259"></a>of the Priests of Egypt in magnifying their antiquities.</p>
<p id="par7">The Cretans affirmed <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n22-ref">[22]</sup> that <em class="underline">Neptune was the first man <a id="l261"></a>who set out a fleet having obteined this Prefecture of Saturn</em> <a id="l262"></a>[the father of Iupiter Neptune &amp; Pluto] <em class="underline">whence posterity <a id="l263"></a>recconed things done in the sea to be under his government, &amp; <a id="l264"></a>mariners honoured him with sacrifices</em>.

<p id="par8">During the reign of Sesac Ieroboam being in subjection to Egypt set up the Gods <a id="l344"></a>of Egypt in Dan &amp; Bethel, &amp; Israel was without a teach<a id="l345"></a>ing Priest, &amp; without law, &amp; the nations were in great <a id="l346"></a>adversity. For in those times there was no peace to him that <a id="l347"></a>went out nor to him that  came in but great vexations <a id="l348"></a>were upon all the inhabitants of the countries. And nation was <a id="l349"></a>destroyed of nation &amp; city of city: for God did vex them sore. <a id="l350"></a>2 Chron. <span class="smallcaps">xv</span>.3, 5, 6. But in the fift year of Asa the land <a id="l351"></a>of Iudah became quiet from war &amp; had quiet ten years, &amp; <a id="l352"></a>Asa took away the Altars of strange Gods &amp; brake down the <a id="l353"></a>images &amp; built the fenced cities of Iudah with walls &amp; towers <a id="l354"></a>&amp; gates &amp; barrs having rest on every side, &amp; got up an army <a id="l355"></a>of 580000 men with which in the 15<sup>th</sup> year of his reign he <a id="l356"></a>met Zerah the Ethiopian who came out against him with <a id="l357"></a>an army of a thousand thousand Ethiopians &amp; Libyans. The <a id="l358"></a>way of the Libyans was through Egypt, &amp; therefore Zerah <a id="l359"></a>was now lord of Egypt. They fought at Maresha near Gerar <a id="l360"></a>between Egypt &amp; Iudea, &amp; Zerah was beaten so that he <a id="l361"></a>could not recover himself. And from all this I seem to gather <a id="l362"></a>that Osiris or Sesac was slain in the fift year of Asa, &amp; <a id="l363"></a>thereupon Egypt fell into civil wars, being invaded by the <a id="l364"></a>Libyans &amp; defended by the Ethiopians for a time, &amp; afterwards <a id="l365"></a>becoming subject to the Ethiopians who slew Orus the son &amp; <a id="l366"></a>successor of Sesac, drowning him in the Nile, &amp; seized his king<a id="l367"></a>dome. By these civil wars of Egypt the land of Iudah had rest <a id="l368"></a>ten years. Sesostris reigned long, Manetho saith 48 years, &amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p007r"> &lt;7r&gt; </span> therefore he began his reign about the 17<sup>th</sup> year of <a id="l369"></a>Solomon or not long after &amp; his son Orus was drowned &amp; Egypt subdued <a id="l370"></a>by the Ethiopians before the 15<sup>th</sup> year of Asa. For Pliny<sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup> tells us: <em class="underline">Ægyptiorum bellis attrita est. Æthiopia vicissim <a id="l371"></a>imperitando serviendoque clara et potens, etiam usque ad <a id="l372"></a>Trojana bella Memnone regnante</em>. Ethiopia might reign <a id="l373"></a>over the upper part of Egypt as far as Thebes till <a id="l374"></a>Ammon or his father  conquered it: for <a id="l375"></a>Homer places Thebes in Ethiopia. Then it served Ægypt <a id="l376"></a>till the death of Sesac &amp; no longer: for Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> tells <a id="l377"></a>us that he alone enjoyed the Empire of Ethiopia. Then <a id="l378"></a>the Ethiopians by the death of their Governour Hercules became free &amp; under Zerah became lords of Egypt &amp; <a id="l379"></a>Libya.</p>
<p id="par9">When Asa by his victory over Zerah became safe from <a id="l380"></a>Egypt, he assembled all the people &amp; they offered sacrifices out <a id="l381"></a>of the spoiles, &amp; entred into a covenant upon oath to seek the <a id="l382"></a>Lord; &amp; lieu of the vessels taken away by Sesac he brought <a id="l383"></a>into the house of the Lord the things which he &amp; his father had dedi<a id="l384"></a>cated, the gold &amp; the silver &amp; the vessels. 2 Chron. 15.</p>
<p id="par10">When Zerah was beaten so that he could not recover himself <a id="l385"></a>the <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> people of the lower Egypt revolted from the Ethiopians, called <a id="l388"></a>in to their assistance 200000 Iews, &amp; under the conduct of one <a id="l389"></a>Osarsiphus a Priest of Egypt caused the Ethiopians, now under Memnon, to retire <a id="l390"></a>to Memphys, where he turned the river into a new channel, built <a id="l391"></a>a bridge over it, &amp; fortified that pass, &amp; then went back into Æthiopia, <a id="l392"></a>But after 13 years Memnon with his young son Ramesses came <a id="l393"></a>down with an army from Ethiopia, conquered the lower Egypt, <a id="l394"></a>&amp; drove out the Iews. And this action the Egyptian writers <a id="l395"></a>&amp; their followers call the second expulsion of the shepherds, <a id="l396"></a>taking Osarsiphus for Moses. Manetho saith that the shepherds <a id="l397"></a>kept Egypt 513 years. Count backwards those years from the <a id="l398"></a>expulsion of the Iews, &amp; the kingdom of the shepherds in <a id="l399"></a>Egypt will begin about six or eight years after the expulsion <a id="l400"></a>of the Canaanites by Ioshua.</p>
<p id="par11">Tithonus a beautifull youth the elder brother of Priam <a id="l401"></a>went into Ethiopia; being carried thither, I think, among many <a id="l402"></a>captives by Sesostris: &amp; the Greeks before the days of Hesiod <a id="l403"></a>feigned that Memnon was his son. Memnon therefore in the <a id="l404"></a>opinion of those ancient Greeks  was one generation younger than Tithonus &amp; was born after <a id="l405"></a>the return of Sesostris into Egypt. He is said to have lived <a id="l406"></a>very long, &amp; so might dye about 90 or 100 years after <a id="l407"></a>Solomon as we recconed above. His mother (called Cissia <a id="l408"></a>by Æschylus) in a statue erected to her in Egypt <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n36-ref">[36]</sup>  was re<a id="l410"></a>presented the daughter the wife &amp; the mother of a king, &amp; therefore he was the son of a king: which makes it probable <a id="l411"></a>that Zerah whom he succeeded in the kingdom might be his father.</p>
<p id="par12"><sup class="note" id="n37-ref">[37]</sup>Historians agree that Menes reigned in Egypt next after <a id="l412"></a>the Gods &amp; built Memphys in the old channel of the Nile after he had <a id="l413"></a>turned the river.

For the names Amenoph or Menoph &amp; Menes do not <a id="l426"></a>much differ. And from Amenoph the city Memphys said to be <a id="l427"></a>built by Menes had its Egyptian names Meph, Noph, Menoph <a id="l428"></a>or Menuf  as it is still called by the Arabian historians. <a id="l429"></a>The fortifying of this place against Osarsiphus gave occasion <a id="l430"></a>to the building of it.</p>

<p id="par14"><sup class="note" id="n42-ref">[42]</sup>The Egyptians originally lived on the fruits of the <a id="l477"></a>earth &amp; fared hardly &amp; absteined from animals &amp; therefore <a id="l478"></a>abominated shepherds. Menes taught them to adorn their <a id="l479"></a> tables &amp; beds with rich carpets, &amp; brought in amongst them <a id="l480"></a>a sumptuous delicious &amp; voluptuous way of life. And about <a id="l481"></a>an hundred years after his death Gnephactus one of his <a id="l482"></a>successors cursed him for doing it, &amp; to reduce the luxury <a id="l483"></a>of Egypt caused the curse to be entred in the Temple of <a id="l484"></a>Iupiter at Thebes. And by this curse the honour of <a id="l485"></a>Menes was diminished among the Egyptians.</p>
<p id="par15">The kings of Egypt reigned first at Thebes &amp; then <a id="l486"></a>at Memphys, &amp; Thebes was famous in Homers days having <a id="l487"></a>been the royal city of Ammon, Osiris, Orus,  Memnon &amp; Ramesses: but <a id="l488"></a>Memphys &amp; her miracles were not yet celebrated in Greece <a id="l489"></a>For Homer celebrates only Thebes as in its glory. After Menes <a id="l490"></a>had built Memphys, Mœris the successor of Ramesses adorned it &amp; made it the seat of the <a id="l491"></a>kingdom; &amp; this was almost two generations after the Trojan <a id="l492"></a>war. Cinyras the Vulcan who married Venus &amp; under <a id="l493"></a>the kings of Egypt reigned over Cyprus &amp; part of Pheni<a id="l494"></a>cia, &amp; made armour for those kings, lived till after the <a id="l495"></a>times of the Trojan war. And upon his death, Menes or <a id="l496"></a>Memnon might deify him &amp; found the famous Temple <a id="l497"></a>of Vulcan in that city for his workshop, but not live to <a id="l498"></a>finish it. <sup class="note" id="n43-ref">[43]</sup>In a plane not far from Memphys, are many <a id="l499"></a>small Pyramids said to be built by Venephes or Enephes, <a id="l500"></a>&amp; I suspect that Venephes &amp; Enephes have been corruptly <a id="l501"></a>written for Menephis or Amenophis the letters AM being almost worn out in some old Manuscript.. For after the example <a id="l502"></a>of these Pyramids, the following kings Mœris &amp; his successors <a id="l503"></a>built others much larger. The plane in which they were <a id="l504"></a>built was the burying place of that city, as appears by the <a id="l505"></a>Mummies there found, &amp; therefore the Pyramids were the <a id="l506"></a>sepulchral monuments of the Kings &amp; Princes of that city. And <a id="l507"></a>by these &amp; such like works the city grew famous and soon after the <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p009r"> &lt;9r&gt; </span> days of Homer. And therefore Homer flourished in the reign of Mœris or not long before.</p>
<p id="par16">Herodotus<sup class="note" id="n44-ref">[44]</sup> is the oldest Historian who wrote of the Egyptian <a id="l508"></a>Antiquities, &amp; had what he wrote from the Priests of Egypt. And <a id="l509"></a>Diodorus who wrote almost 400 years after him, &amp; had his re<a id="l510"></a>lations also from the Priests of Egypt, placed many nameless <a id="l511"></a>kings between those whom Herodotus placed in continual sic<a id="l512"></a>cession. The Priests of Egypt had therefore between the days <a id="l513"></a>of Herodotus &amp; Diodorus, out of vanity, very much increased <a id="l514"></a>the number of their kings. And what they did after the days <a id="l515"></a>of Herodotus, they did also before his days. For he tells us that <a id="l516"></a>they recited to him out of their books the names of 330 kings <a id="l517"></a>who reigned after Menes, but did nothing memorable except <a id="l518"></a>Nitocris &amp; Mœris the last of them. After Mœris he reccons <a id="l519"></a>Sesostris, Pheron, Proteus, Rhampsinitus, Cheops, Cepren, Mycerinus, <a id="l520"></a>Asychis, Anysis &amp; Nechus, Sabacus, Anysis again, Sethon, twelve <a id="l521"></a>contemporary kings, Psammiticus, Necus, Psammis, Apries, Amasis, <a id="l522"></a>Psammenitus. The Egyptians had before the days of Solon made <a id="l523"></a>their antiquities 9000 years older then the truth; &amp; here to <a id="l524"></a>make it out they reccon to Herodotus a succession of 330 kings <a id="l525"></a>reigning so many generations (that is 11000 years) before Sesos<a id="l526"></a>tris. But before the use of letters they could not write <a id="l527"></a>down the names of their kings. They could only represent <a id="l528"></a>them by symbols &amp; by their memorable actions; &amp; therefore <a id="l529"></a>we may with Herodotus, omit the names of those who did <a id="l530"></a>nothing memorable, &amp; consider only those whose actions are <a id="l531"></a>recorded. For those reduced into due order will give us all <a id="l532"></a>or almost all the kings of Egypt from the days of the first <a id="l533"></a>expulsion of the shepherds &amp; reign of the Gods of Egypt <a id="l534"></a>downwards to the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses. For Sesostris <a id="l535"></a>reigned in the age of the Gods, being deified by the name of <a id="l536"></a>Osiris &amp; Bacchus as above: &amp; therefore Menes Nitocris &amp; Mœris are to be placed after him. Mœris is set down immediately before <a id="l537"></a>Cheops three times in the Dynasty of the kings of Egypt composed <a id="l538"></a>by Eratosthenes &amp; once in the Dynasties of Manetho; &amp; in the <a id="l539"></a>same Dynasties Nitocris is set after the builders of the great <a id="l540"></a>Pyramids. And thence I gather that the kings of Egypt menti<a id="l541"></a>oned by Herodotus ought to be placed in this order. Ammon, Sesos<a id="l542"></a>tris, Pheron, Proteus Menes, Rhampsinitus, Mœris, Cheops, Cephren, My<a id="l543"></a>cerinus, Nitocris, Asychis, Anysis &amp; Nechus, Sabacus, Anysis <a id="l544"></a>again, Sethon, twelve contemporary kings, Psammiticus, Necus, <a id="l545"></a>Psammis, Apries, Amasis, Psammenitus.</p>
<p id="par17">Pheron is by Herodotus called the son &amp; successor of <a id="l546"></a>Sesostris &amp; so seems to be the same king with Orus called <a id="l547"></a>Pharaoh or Pheron after his fathers death. Pliny calls him <a id="l548"></a>Nuncoreus.</p>
<p id="par18">Proteus reigned in the lower Egypt when Paris sailed <a id="l549"></a>thither, [that is, eight years after the taking of Troy]. And <a id="l550"></a>at that time Amenophis was king of all Egypt. Proteus might <a id="l551"></a>be a Viceroy. For Homer places him upon the sea coasts <a id="l552"></a>&amp; makes him a sea-god, &amp; calls him the servant of Neptune, <a id="l553"></a>&amp; Herodotus saith that he rose up from among the common <a id="l554"></a>people, &amp; that Proteus was his name translated into Greek; <a id="l555"></a>&amp; this name in Greek signifies only a Prince or President. He <a id="l556"></a>had therefore another name &amp; so might be Osarsiphus.</p>
<p id="par19">Amenophis reigned next after Orus &amp; Isis the last of the Gods, <a id="l557"></a>&amp; by conquering Osarsiphus who had revolted from him became <a id="l558"></a>king of all Egypt. He ordered the worship of the Gods of Egypt, &amp; built a Palace at Abydus, &amp; the Memnonia at This &amp; Susa. <a id="l559"></a>He is by corruption of his name called Menes, Mnevis, Enephes, <a id="l560"></a>Venephes, Phamenophis, Osimandes, Memnon, Arminon. After <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p010r"> &lt;10r&gt; </span> he had built Memphys &amp; the Temple of Vulcan, he was <a id="l561"></a>succeeded by his son called by Herodotus Rhampsinitus &amp; by <a id="l562"></a>others Ramses, Rameses, Ramesses, Ramestes, Rhampses, Remphis. <a id="l563"></a>Vpon <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n45-ref">[45]</sup> an Obelisk erected by this king in Heliopolis &amp; sent to <a id="l565"></a>Rome by the Emperor Constantius, was an inscription interpreted <a id="l566"></a>by Hermapion an Egyptian Priest, expressing that this king was <a id="l567"></a>long lived &amp; reigned over a great part of the earth. And <sup>b</sup><sup class="note" id="n46-ref">[46]</sup> Strabo <a id="l569"></a>an eye witness tells us that in the Monuments of the kings of <a id="l570"></a>Egypt above the Memnonium were inscriptions upon Obelisks <a id="l571"></a>expressing the riches of the kings &amp; their reigning as far as <a id="l572"></a>Scythia Bactria India &amp; Ionia. And Tacitus <sup>c</sup><sup class="note" id="n47-ref">[47]</sup> tells us from <a id="l574"></a>an inscription seen at Thebes by Cæsar Germanicus &amp; inter<a id="l575"></a>preted to him by the Egyptian Priests that this king Ramesses <a id="l576"></a>had an army of 70000 men, &amp; reigned over Libya, Ethiopia, <a id="l577"></a>Media, Persia, Bactria, Scythia, Armenia Cappadocia, Bithy<a id="l578"></a>nia &amp; Lycia. And therefore Babylon &amp; Susa were still <a id="l579"></a>subject to Egypt. This king was very <sup>d</sup><sup class="note" id="n48-ref">[48]</sup> covetous &amp; a great <a id="l582"></a>collector of Taxes, &amp; one of the richest of all the kings of <a id="l583"></a>Egypt. He built the western Portico of the Temple of Vulcan <a id="l584"></a>&amp; Mœris built the northern Portico thereof more sumptuously <a id="l585"></a>&amp; therefore reigned after him. Mœris also inheriting the <a id="l586"></a>riches of Ramesses made the Lake of Mœris with two great <a id="l587"></a>Pyramids of brick in the midst of it, &amp; the Labyrinth adjoyning <a id="l588"></a>which was a very magnificent structure. And for preserving <a id="l589"></a>the division of Egypt into equal shares amongst the soul<a id="l590"></a>diers this king wrote a book of surveying, which gave a <a id="l591"></a>beginning to Geometry. He is called also Maris, Myris, <a id="l592"></a>Marres, &amp; corruptly (by changing M into <span class="greek">Α</span>, VI, <span class="greek">Σ, ΥΧ, Λ</span> &amp;c) <a id="l593"></a>Ayres, Biyres, Soris, Vchoreus, Lachares, Labaris, Thuoris, &amp;c.</p>
<p id="par20">Diodorus places Vchoreus between Osimandes &amp; Myris, &amp; <a id="l594"></a>says that he built Memphys &amp; fortified it to admiration with a <a id="l595"></a>mighty rampart of earth &amp; a broad &amp; deep trench which was filled <a id="l596"></a>with the water of the Nile, &amp; built palaces in it; &amp; that this <a id="l597"></a>place was so commodiously seated that most of the kings who <a id="l598"></a>reigned after him preferred it before Thebes, &amp; removed the <a id="l599"></a>Court from thence to this place, so that the magnificence of <a id="l600"></a>Thebes from that time began to decrease &amp; that of Memphys <a id="l601"></a>to increase till Alexander king of Macedon built Alexandria. <a id="l602"></a>These great works of Vchoreus &amp; those of Mœris savour of <a id="l603"></a>one &amp; the same king distinguished into two by a corruption of <a id="l604"></a>the name as above.</p>
<p id="par21">After the example of the two brick Pyramids made by Mœris <a id="l605"></a>the three next kings Cheops, Cephren, &amp; Mycerinus built the three <a id="l606"></a>great Pyramids of marble. Cheops shut up the Temples &amp; prohi<a id="l607"></a>bited the worship of the Gods of Egypt, designing no doubt to have <a id="l608"></a>been worshipped himself after death. He was called also Chembis, <a id="l609"></a>Chemmis, Phiops, Phius, Suphis, Saophis, Siphoas, Siphaosis, Soiphis, <a id="l610"></a>Siphuris, Anoyphis, Anoisis, Apappus maximus. He built the <a id="l611"></a>first great Pyramid, &amp; his brother Cephren the second, &amp; his son <a id="l612"></a>Micerinus  founded the third. This last king shut up the <a id="l613"></a>dead body of his daughter in a hollow Ox &amp; caused her to <a id="l614"></a>be worshipped daily with odours. He is called also Cheres, <a id="l615"></a>Cherinus, Bicheres, Moscheres, Mencheres. He died before the <a id="l616"></a>third Pyramid was finished &amp; his sister &amp; successor Nitocris <a id="l617"></a>finished it. Then reigned Asychis who built the eastern <a id="l618"></a>Portico of the Temple of Vulcan very splendidly &amp; a large <a id="l619"></a>Pyramid of brick made of mud dug out of the lake of Mœris. <a id="l620"></a>And these are the kings who reigned at Memphys &amp; spent their <a id="l621"></a>time in adorning that city, untill Egypt lost all her dominion <a id="l622"></a>abroad &amp; became again divided into several small king<a id="l623"></a>doms.</p>
