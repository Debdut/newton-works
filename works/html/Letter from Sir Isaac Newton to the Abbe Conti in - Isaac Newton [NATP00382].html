<p id="par1">Sir</p>
<p id="par2">3 When the Differential method began to be celebrated in Holland  D<sup>r</sup> Wallis, in the introduction to his Works printed in the <a id="l2"></a>year 1695, wrote that this method was the sam with the method of fluxions <a id="l3"></a> which M<sup>r</sup> Newton had explained to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  in his Letters <a id="l4"></a>written 1676 &amp; had invented ten years before that time or above. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l5"></a>in the correspondence which followed thereupon between him &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Wallis <a id="l6"></a>did not deny this nor contend for any thing more then that he had added something to M<sup>r</sup> Newtons method and what he had added  was his own. M<sup>r</sup> Newton in the   Introduction to his Quadratura Curvarum <a id="l8"></a>published  about 12 years ago wrote that he <a id="l9"></a>had found the  method of fluxions by  steps in the years <a id="l10"></a>1665 &amp; 1666.  D<sup>r</sup> Wallis being dead M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz now pretends that M<sup>r</sup> Newton  <a id="l11"></a> did not invent  it so early nor was the first <a id="l12"></a>inventor &amp; upon D<sup>r</sup> Keills defending D<sup>r</sup> Wallis against what has <a id="l13"></a>been published to this purpose in the Acta  Eruditorum, has  <a id="l14"></a> affirmed that what was there published,  was just  &amp; he has demanded that <a id="l15"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Keill should recant &amp; that M<sup>r</sup> Newton should declare his opinion in this <a id="l16"></a>matter, that is, that he should retract what he had published in the  said <a id="l17"></a>Introduction.  Vpon M<sup>r</sup> Newton's being thus accused of plagi<a id="l18"></a>ary, the R. Society ordered the ancient Letters &amp; papers to be <a id="l19"></a>published,  But M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  refuses to make good <a id="l20"></a>his accusation. huffs at what was published as trifling, complains    what made for him &amp; particularly   what he <a id="l22"></a>had seen in England  in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins about M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l23"></a>Newton's ignorance has been suppressed, &amp; appeales from the judgment of the Committee of <a id="l24"></a>the R Society to the jugment of his  disciple &amp; confederate M<sup>r</sup> Iohn Bernoulli. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l25"></a>having thus accused D<sup>r</sup> Keill of what he durst not accuse D<sup>r</sup> Wallis &amp; <a id="l26"></a>demanded that  M<sup>r</sup> Newton also should be questioned for what <a id="l28"></a>he published to the same purpose (all which amounts to an accusation of <a id="l29"></a>Plagiary against M<sup>r</sup> Newton) it lies upon M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz by the laws of <a id="l30"></a>all nations either to prove his accusation, or else to be deemed guilty of <a id="l31"></a>calumny.</p>

<p id="par4">How little reason there is for M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz to sleight the ancient <a id="l32"></a>papers printed by order of the R. Society or the interpretations put upon <a id="l33"></a>them, may appear by this instance that there is a letter in the hand <a id="l34"></a>writing of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz dated from Paris May 1675, in  he acknowledges the receipt of  a Letter with several <a id="l36"></a>from M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburgh. This Letter was dated 15 April preceding <a id="l37"></a>series in it &amp; conteins  a series for finding the Arch whose tangents was given. <a id="l38"></a> which series was invented by M<sup>r</sup> Gregory four years before. And M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l39"></a> Leibnitz  when he first received it from London did not know it to be his own  but as appears by the Letter <span class="hspac-n" title="8 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; yet the same year communicated it <a id="l41"></a>to his friends at Paris as his own &amp; afterwards published it  <a id="l42"></a>in Germany as  his own without ever acknowledging that he had received it from <a id="l43"></a>London.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p558v-a"> &lt;558v&gt; </span>
<p id="par5">And as for his complaint that  what made for him &amp; particularly what he saw in the <a id="l44"></a>hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins  concerning M<sup>r</sup> Newtons ignorance, has <a id="l45"></a>been  suppressed in the Commercium;  it is  unjust  That passag is there printed <a id="l46"></a>pag 75, lin 10, 11. And by the statutes of the R. Society it is expulsion <a id="l47"></a>to defame them.</p>

<p id="par7">What he  saw in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins was in M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l50"></a>Newtons Letter of 24 October 1676.  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was in London <a id="l51"></a>some part of that Month &amp;  before he left London saw that <a id="l52"></a>Letter in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins but staied not to take a <a id="l53"></a>copy of it along with him. He tells us that  M<sup>r</sup> Collins then <a id="l54"></a>shewed him a part of his correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Collins &amp; <a id="l55"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton. I suppose he means the originals  from whence <a id="l56"></a>their series had been taken.</p>
<p id="par8">6 M<sup>r</sup>  Leibnitz tells us that it would have been easy for M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l57"></a>Newton to find the differential method, if it had been hinted to <a id="l58"></a>him: &amp; was it not as easy for M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz to find it by the <a id="l59"></a>hints which  he received from M<sup>r</sup> Newtons Letters of 10 Dec <a id="l60"></a>1672, 13 Iune 1676 &amp; 24 Octob. 1676.</p>

<p id="par10">7 He allows that M<sup>r</sup> Newton preceded him in the method <a id="l61"></a>of Series, but he saith that at length he invented a general <a id="l62"></a>method of series,  after which he had no further use <a id="l63"></a>of M<sup>r</sup> Newton's extractions. And yet his general method is <a id="l64"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton's. In his Letter of 13 Iune 1676 M<sup>r</sup> Newton repre<a id="l65"></a>sented that his method of Series was not general without some <a id="l66"></a>other Methods: &amp; in his Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 he repre<a id="l67"></a>sented that his  method of Series  became general by two <a id="l68"></a>Methods:  one of which consisted in extracting  fluents out <a id="l69"></a>of equations involving their fluxions, the other in assuming the <a id="l70"></a>terms of a series &amp; determining them by the conditions of the <a id="l71"></a>Probleme. The first method  demonstrates that M<sup>r</sup> Newton was <a id="l72"></a>then well  acquainted with fluxional Equations &amp; had then <a id="l73"></a>carried Analysis to a higher pitch in such Equations then  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  has <a id="l74"></a>been able to  carry it in differential Equations to this day. The <a id="l75"></a>second is that very general method of Series which M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p559r-c"> &lt;559r&gt; </span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p558v-b"> &lt;558v&gt; </span>  claims  from <a id="l76"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton. And it lies upon M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz to make it appear that <a id="l77"></a>he knew either of those methods so early.</p>

<p id="par11">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was in London the first time in Feb. 1673 &amp;  went to Paris in or about <a id="l78"></a>the beginning of March following, &amp; at that time knew nothing of the higher Geometry <a id="l79"></a>but some time after  (suppose in the year 1674<span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>)<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> began to be instructed in it at <a id="l80"></a>Paris by M<sup>r</sup> Huygens as he represents in his Letter to you.

<p id="par12">1. M<sup>r</sup> Newton gave an instance of his  method of fluxions in his Analysis <a id="l87"></a>per Æquationes numero termin communicated by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> Collins in the year 1669 &amp; described <a id="l88"></a>the universality of it in  his Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Collins dated 10 Decem 1672 with an <a id="l89"></a>example therof in drawing of Tangents,  a copy of which Letter was sent to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l90"></a>at Paris in the year 1676, &amp; in his Letters of 13 Iune &amp; 24 Octob. 1676 described the <a id="l91"></a>method further to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  as extending to Quadratures of Curves, invers Problems of Tangents &amp; others more difficult &amp; <a id="l92"></a>there also gave an example of it in a general series  for squaring of Curves. <a id="l93"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz   began to learn the higher Geometry in the year 1674 &amp; came from Paris to London in October  1676, &amp; there saw this last Letter in the hand <a id="l94"></a>of M<sup>r</sup> Collins &amp; by his Letter &amp; that of 10 Decem 1672  ✝ ✝ understanding that the  new methods of Tangents were a  branch of M<sup>r</sup> Newtons general method, fell upon considering how to make M<sup>r</sup> Newtons method of Tangents (which was the same with that of Slusius, become general, &amp; the next year &amp; the next year  in a Letter from Hannover dated 21 Iune 1677  <a id="l95"></a>sent back D<sup>r</sup> Barrows method of Tangents,  the name &amp; charac<a id="l96"></a>teristick , &amp; shewed how this method gave the method of Slusius <a id="l97"></a> &amp; might be improved much beyond his former method (that of D<sup>r</sup> Barrow) so as to proceed without taking away fractions &amp; surds    <a id="l98"></a> &amp; extend to Quadratures &amp; then he took notice that <a id="l99"></a> <a id="l100"></a>these performances being the same with those which M<sup>r</sup> Newton had ascribed <a id="l101"></a>to his method,  he took this  his new method to be like M<sup>r</sup> Newtons. Thus was he then endeavouring to find out M<sup>r</sup> Newtons method. But now he contends that M<sup>r</sup> Newton.  <a id="l102"></a> had no such method in those days. M<sup>r</sup> Newton in his Letter of 24 Octob <a id="l103"></a>represented that his method was founded in solving this Probleme Data æquatione fluentes <a id="l104"></a>quotcunque quantitates involvente fluxiones invenire &amp; vice versa, &amp; that his method of series <a id="l105"></a>became universal by solving this Probleme  <a id="l106"></a>Fluentem ex æquatione fluxiones involvente extrahere. But M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz tells <a id="l107"></a>us that M<sup>r</sup> Newton  in those days had no method of fluxions no fluxional <a id="l108"></a>equations,  no characteristick for fluxions &amp; moments. D<sup>r</sup> Barrow <a id="l109"></a>published his differential method of Tangents in the year 1670. M<sup>r</sup> Newton knew that <a id="l110"></a>method  some years before M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; yet is accused of wanting a differential Characteristic</p>
<p id="par13">4 When M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz first published his differential Method,<sup class="note" id="n1-ref">[1]</sup> he wrote that it <a id="l111"></a>reacht to such difficult Problems as could not be solved <a id="l112"></a>without  the method or another  like it. And what other method <a id="l113"></a>he meant you may know by his Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Newton dated 17 March 1693 <a id="l114"></a>&amp; still extant in his own hand writing. His words are Mirifice ampliaveras <a id="l115"></a>Geometriam tuis seriebus, sed etiam edito Principiorum opere ostendisti patere <a id="l116"></a>tibi etiam quæ Analysi receptæ non subsunt. Conatus sum ego quoque, notis <a id="l117"></a>commodis adhibitis quæ Differentias &amp; Summas exhibeant, Geometriam <a id="l118"></a>illam quam transcendentem appello Analysi quodammodo subjicere; nec res <a id="l119"></a>male processit. And hitherto M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz forbore to contend with M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l120"></a>Newton for the preference.</p>
<p id="par14">4 Afterwards in the year 1699 M<sup>r</sup> Fatio  published <a id="l121"></a>that M<sup>r</sup> Newton was the oldest inventory by many years &amp; M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l122"></a>Leibnits  in his Answer published in the Acta Eruditorum for May 1700 <a id="l123"></a>did not dispute it but granted that M<sup>r</sup> Newton was the first who by giving <a id="l124"></a>a  specimen of this method openly, had proved that he had it, &amp; contended for <a id="l125"></a>nothing more then that each of them had found the method apart without receiving <a id="l126"></a>light from the other.</p>
<p id="par15">5 In October 1704 D<sup>r</sup> Wallis died, the last of the old men who corresponded with <a id="l127"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Collins in these matters. And then M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz began <a id="l128"></a>to claim the precedency. For in Ianuary 1705 in giving an Account of M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l129"></a>Newton's Quadratura Curvarum  <a id="l130"></a>in which M<sup>r</sup> Newton had said that he found the Method of fluxion gradually in the <a id="l131"></a>years 1665 &amp; 1666, it was retorted upon him that he had substituted fluxions for the <a id="l132"></a>differences of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the first Inentor.  <a id="l133"></a>And when D<sup>r</sup> Keill defended D<sup>r</sup> Wallis &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Newton, M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz defended what had <a id="l134"></a>been published in the Acta Eruditorum, &amp; demanded that D<sup>r</sup> Keill should recant &amp;  <a id="l135"></a> taxed M<sup>r</sup> Newton with knowing that D<sup>r</sup> Keill was in the wrong &amp; <a id="l136"></a>pressed that he should declare his opinion in this matter, that is, that M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l137"></a>Newton should retract what had been  publickly affirmed by D<sup>r</sup> Wallis M<sup>r</sup> Fatio D<sup>r</sup> Keill &amp; <a id="l138"></a>himself, &amp; granted by M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Letter of 21 Iune 1677 [See Commercium p 88 <a id="l139"></a>lin 14 &amp; p. 8 9 lin penult. &amp; p. 90 lin. 26, 27, 28] &amp;  not disputed <a id="l140"></a>in his correspondence with D<sup>r</sup> Wallis &amp; answer to M<sup>r</sup> Fatio <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p559r-b"> &lt;559r&gt; </span> The accusation against M<sup>r</sup> Newton amounts to to plagiary, &amp; if it be not made good <a id="l141"></a>it ought to go for calumny, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz is the man who ought to make it <a id="l142"></a>good.</p>

<p id="par22">Sir</p>
<p id="par23">  You know that  the Commercium Epistolicum  conteining the <a id="l151"></a>ancient Letters &amp; Papers  preserved in the Archives &amp; Letter Books of the R. S. <a id="l152"></a>&amp; Library of M<sup>r</sup> Collins   relating to the dispute between M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Keil. They were collected &amp; pub<a id="l153"></a>lished by  a Committee appointed by the R. Society for that pur<a id="l154"></a>pose; &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz has hither  avoided returning an Answer to the same.  for the Book is matter of fact &amp; uncapable of an Answer. <a id="l156"></a> For avoiding an Answer he pretended  that he <a id="l157"></a>had not seen  this Book nor had leasure to examin it,  but had desired an eminent <a id="l158"></a>Mathematician to examin it. And the Answer of the Mathematician or prettended  Mathematician was in<a id="l159"></a>sertd into a defamatory Libel  dated <span class="hspac-n" title="10 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; <a id="l160"></a>published in Germany without the name of the author or publisher or City <a id="l161"></a>where it was published. And I have since seen some Letters written since by <a id="l162"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in all which he excuses himself from returning an Answer <a id="l163"></a>And the Postscript which you shewed me is of the same kind. For He tells you <a id="l164"></a>in it that the English shall not have the pleasure of seing him return <a id="l165"></a>an Answer to their slender reasonings as he calls them,   &amp; the whole Postscript is reflecting &amp; defamatory without proving any thing &amp; he falls upon my Philosophy,  which is nothing <a id="l168"></a>at all to the Question &amp; in squabling about it  corrupts the significations of words calling those things miracles which happen constantly  &amp; those things occult qualities which are not occult &amp; contends for Hypotheses in opposition to Propositions proved from Experiments &amp; observations &amp; experiments by the argument of Induction, &amp; ascribes opinions to me which are not mine. &amp; at the same time he has sent a Mathematical <a id="l169"></a>Probleme to be solved by the English Mathematicians which is as little the <a id="l170"></a>purpose. </p>
<p id="par24">He complains of the Committee of the R. Soc. as if they had <a id="l171"></a>acted partially in omitting what made against me.  But in proving the accusation he instances in a Paragraph  concerning my ignorance which he says they omitted.   And yet <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>For<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> This Paragraph is not omitted. It is in my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676, &amp; you <a id="l175"></a>will find it in the Commercium Epistolicum pag <span class="hspac-n" title="7 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> lin <span class="hspac-n" title="5 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>. He saith that <a id="l176"></a>he saw this Paragraph  in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Colling <a id="l177"></a>when he was in London the second time that is, in October 1676, &amp; there<a id="l178"></a>fore he then saw that Letter.  And in that &amp; some other Letters writ before that time I described the <a id="l179"></a>method of fluxions, &amp; in the same Letter I described two general methods <a id="l180"></a>of Series one of which M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  now claims to himself.</p>
<p id="par25">1  I beleive you will think it reasonable that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz be constant to himself &amp; still acknowledge <a id="l181"></a> what he acknowledged above 15 years ago &amp;  still forbeare to <a id="l182"></a> contradict what he forbore to contradict in those days.  In his Letter of 20 <a id="l183"></a>May 1675  with  several converging Series conteined therein &amp; I expect that he still <a id="l184"></a>acknowledge the receipt thereof.</p>
<p id="par26">2 In a Letter datd 12 May 1676 he acknowledged that he then wanted the method <a id="l185"></a>for finding a Series for the Arc whose sine was given, &amp; by consequence that <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p560v-a"> &lt;560v&gt; </span> when he wrote his Letter of 26 Octob. 1674 he wanted that method. 3 In the Acta <a id="l186"></a>Eruditorum for May 1700, he acknowledged that no body So far as he knew had the method of <a id="l187"></a>Fluxions or Differences before me &amp; him, &amp; that no body before me had proved <a id="l188"></a>by a specimen made publick that he had the method: &amp; I expect that he <a id="l189"></a>continues to make the same acknowledgement . <span class="MathJax_Preview" style=""></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><menclose notation=&quot;box&quot;><mn>7</mn></menclose></math>" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1" style="width: 1.034em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 1.031em; height: 0px; font-size: 97%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.304em, 1001.03em, 2.939em, -1000em); top: -2.448em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="menclose" id="MathJax-Span-3"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 1.05em; height: 0px;"><span id="MathJax-frame-3" style="border: 0.075em solid; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: 0.9em; height: 1.098em; vertical-align: -0.075em; position: absolute; top: -0.951em; left: 0em;"></span><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.126em, 1000.49em, 4.21em, -1000em); top: -3.995em; left: 0.275em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-4"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-5" style="font-family: MathJax_Main;">7</span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.995em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.448em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.351em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.336em;"></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><menclose notation="box"><mn>7</mn></menclose></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-1"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><menclose notation="box"><mn>7</mn></menclose></math></script> D<sup>r</sup> Wallis in the Preface to the two <a id="l190"></a>first volumes of his works published in April or May 1695 wrote that I <a id="l191"></a>in  two Letters  written in the year 1676 had explained  to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l192"></a>the Method (called by me the Method of fluxions &amp; by him the method of differences <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p560v-b"> &lt;560v&gt; </span>  invented by me ten years before or above, that is in the year 1666 <a id="l193"></a>or before, &amp; in the Letters which followed between them,  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  had notice of this Paragraph &amp; did not  then contradict it nor <a id="l195"></a>found any fault with it &amp; I expect that he still forbears to contradict it <a id="l196"></a>But  as he has attaqued me with an accusation which amounts to plagiary if he goes on to accuse me  it lies upon him by the laws of <a id="l197"></a>all nations to prove his accusation  on pain of being accounted guilty of <a id="l198"></a>calumny. </p>
<p id="par27">4. ② In his Letter to me dated 7. March 1693 &amp; now in the custody of the R. S. <a id="l199"></a>he wrote  Mirifice ampliaveras Geometriam tuis seriebus, sed edito <a id="l200"></a>Principiorum opere ostendisti patere tibi quæ Analysi receptæ non subsunt <a id="l201"></a>Conatus sum Ego quoque notis commodis adhibitis quæ differentias &amp; summas <a id="l202"></a>exhibent, Geometriam illam quam transcendentem appello, Analysi quodam<a id="l203"></a>modo subjicere, nec res male processit. And ① in the Acta Eruditorum for <a id="l204"></a>October 1684, when he had described  the <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">differential method</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">elements of his method</span></span> of tangents <a id="l205"></a>&amp; Maxima &amp; Minima he added that the method extended to the difficulter <a id="l206"></a>sort of Problems which without this method or ANOTHER LIKE IT could <a id="l207"></a>not be managed so easily. ③ And what he then acknowledged he ought <a id="l208"></a>still to acknowledge.</p>
<p id="par28">5 In his Letter of 21 Iune 1677  in answer to mine of 24 Octob 1676   wherein I had described my method partly in plane words &amp; partly in cyphers he said that <a id="l210"></a>he agreed with me that the method of  tangents of Slusius was not yet <a id="l211"></a>perfect &amp;  then set down  a differential method of tangents <a id="l212"></a> published by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in the year 1670 &amp;  shewed how it might be improved to perform those <a id="l213"></a>things which I had attributed to my method &amp; thence concluded that mine differ<a id="l214"></a>ed not much from his, especially since it faciliated Quadratures: &amp; in can<a id="l215"></a>dor he ought still to acknowledge that he then understood that  <a id="l216"></a>when I wrote my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 I had such a method.</p>
<p id="par29">6 In his Letter of  27 Aug. 1676 he represented that he did not <a id="l217"></a>beleive that my methods were so general as I had described them,  <a id="l218"></a>&amp; affirmed that there were many Problemes so difficult that they  did not <a id="l219"></a>depend upon  Equations &amp; Quadratures: such as (amongst many <a id="l220"></a>others) were the inverse Problemes of tangents. And by  these words that <a id="l221"></a>he had not yet found the  reduction of Problems to Differential <a id="l222"></a>Equations . And what he then acknowledged he ought in candor to <a id="l223"></a>acknowledge still.</p>
<p id="par30">8 And  after this I beleive you will see that I described the extent <a id="l224"></a>&amp; nature of this method in my Letter of 10 Decem 1672 &amp; that I couched <a id="l225"></a>both the Differential &amp; the Summatory Method in my Tract of Analysis <a id="l226"></a>communicated by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> Collins in  Iuly 1669. At which <a id="l227"></a>time M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had not yet begun to  learn Algebra <a id="l228"></a>&amp; the higher Geometry.</p>
<p id="par31">But if he goes on still to accuse me of plagiary,  it lies upon <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>him<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l229"></a>by the laws of all nations to  prove his accusation on pain of <a id="l230"></a>being deemed guilty of calumny.

<p id="par40">Sir</p>
<br><br>
<p id="par41">You know that the Commercium Epistolicum conteins the <a id="l256"></a>ancient Letters &amp; Papers preserved in the Archives &amp; Letter Books <a id="l257"></a>of the Royal Society &amp; Library of M<sup>r</sup> Collins relating to the <a id="l258"></a>dispute between M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Keill &amp; that they were collected <a id="l259"></a>&amp; published by a numerous Committee of Gentlemen of several <a id="l260"></a>nations appointed by the Royal Society for that purpose. M<sup>r</sup> Leib<a id="l261"></a>nitz hath hitherto avoided returning an Answer to the same: for the <a id="l262"></a>book is matter of fact &amp; uncapable of an Answer. To avoid answering <a id="l263"></a>it he pretended the first year that he had not seen this book nor had lea<a id="l264"></a>sure to examin it, but had desired an eminent Mathematician to examin it. <a id="l265"></a>And the Answer of the Mathematician (or pretended Mathematician) dated 7  <a id="l266"></a>Iune 1713 was inserted into a defamatory Letter dated 29 Iuly following <a id="l267"></a>&amp; published in Germany without the name of the Author or Printer or <a id="l268"></a>city where it was printed. And the whole has been since translated into French <a id="l269"></a>&amp; inserted into another abusive Letter (of the same Author as I suspect) <a id="l270"></a>&amp; answered by D<sup>r</sup> Keill in Iuly 1714 &amp; no answer is yet given to the <a id="l271"></a>Doctor.</p>
<p id="par42">Hitherto M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz avoided returning an Answer to the Commerci<a id="l272"></a>um Epistolicum by pretending that he had not seen it: And now he avoids it <a id="l273"></a>by telling you that the English shall not have the pleasure  to see <a id="l274"></a>him return an answer to their slender reasonings (as he calls them) &amp; by <a id="l275"></a>endeavouring to engage  me in disputes about Philosophy &amp; about solving <a id="l276"></a>of Problems both which are nothing to the Question.</p>
<p id="par43">As to Philosophy, he colludes in the significations of words, preferrs Hy<a id="l277"></a>potheses to arguments of Induction from experiments, accuses me of opinions <a id="l278"></a>which are not mine, &amp; instead of proposing Questions to be examined by <a id="l279"></a>experiments before they are admitted into Philosophy he proposes Hypo<a id="l280"></a>theses to be admitted &amp; beleived before they are examined. But all this <a id="l281"></a>is nothing to the Commercium Epistolicum.</p>
<p id="par44">He complains of the Committee of the Royall Society as if they had <a id="l282"></a>acted partially in omitting what made against me. But he fails in proving <a id="l283"></a>the accusation. For he instances in a Paragraph concerning my ignorance <a id="l284"></a>pretending that they omitted it, &amp; yet you will find it in the Commercium <a id="l285"></a>Epistolicum pag. 74 lin. 10, 11, &amp; I am not ashamed of it. He saith that <a id="l286"></a>he saw this Paragraph in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins when he was in <a id="l287"></a>London the second time, that is, in October 1676. It is in my Letter of <a id="l288"></a>24 Octob. 1676, &amp; therefore he then saw that Letter. And in that &amp; <a id="l289"></a>some other Letters writ before that time I described my method of <a id="l290"></a>fluxions. And in the same Letter I described also two general methods <a id="l291"></a>of series, one of which is now claimed from me by M<sup>r</sup>Leibnitz.</p>
<p id="par45">I beleive you will think it reasonable that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz be constant <a id="l292"></a>to himself, &amp; still acknowledge what he acknowledged above 15 years <a id="l293"></a>ago, &amp; still forbear to contradict what he forbore to contradict in those <a id="l294"></a>days.</p>
<p id="par46">In his Letter of 20 May 1675 he acknowledged the Receipt of a Letter <a id="l295"></a>from M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburge dated 15 Apr. 1675 with several converging series conteined <a id="l296"></a>therein. And I expect from him that he still acknowledge the Receipt thereof. <a id="l297"></a>Many Gentlemen of Italy France &amp; Germany (you your self being one of them) <a id="l298"></a>have seen the original Letters &amp; the entrys thereof in the old Letter books of <a id="l299"></a>the Royal Society, &amp; the series of Gregory is in the  Letter of 15 Apr. 1675 &amp; in Gregories original Letter dated 15 Feb. 1671.</p>
<p id="par47">In a Letter dated 12 May 1676 he acknowledged that he wanted the <a id="l300"></a>method for finding a series for the Arc whose sine was given, &amp; by consequence <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p562v-a"> &lt;562v&gt; </span> that he wanted it when he wrote his Letter of 24 Octob. 1674. And <a id="l301"></a>I expect that he still acknowledge it.</p>
<p id="par48">In the Acta Eruditorum for May 1700,  in answer to M<sup>r</sup> Fatio who had said that I was the oldest inven<a id="l303"></a>tor by many years, he acknowledged that no body, so far as he knew, had <a id="l304"></a>the method of fluxions or differences before me &amp; him &amp; that no body before <a id="l305"></a>me had proved by a specimen made publick that he had it. Here he allowed <a id="l306"></a>that I had the method before it was published or communicated by him <a id="l307"></a>to any body in Germany, &amp; that the Principia Philosophiæ were a proof that <a id="l308"></a>I had it &amp; the first specimen made publick of applying it to the difficult<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p563r"> &lt;563r&gt; </span>er <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p562v-b"> &lt;562v&gt; </span> Problemes. And I expect that he still continue to make the same ac<a id="l309"></a>knowledgement. At that time he did not deny what M<sup>r</sup> Fatio affirmed <a id="l310"></a>&amp; nothing but want of candor can make him unconstant to himself.</p>
<p id="par49">In a Letter to me dated 7 March 1693 &amp; now in the custody <a id="l311"></a>of the R. Society, he wrote, Mirifice ampliaveras Geometriam tuis <a id="l312"></a>seriebus, sed edito Principiorum opere ostendisti patere tibi etiam quæ Analysi <a id="l313"></a>receptæ non subsunt. Conatus sum Ego quoque notis commodis adhibitis quæ <a id="l314"></a>differentias et summas exhibent, Geometriam illam quam transcendentem <a id="l315"></a>appello, Analysi quodammodo subjicere, nec res male processit &amp;c. And <a id="l316"></a>what he then acknowledged he ought still to acknowledge</p>

<p id="par53">Hitherto  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz avoided returning an Answer to the Commercium <a id="l332"></a>Epistolicum by pretending that he had not seen it.

<p id="par54"> As to Philosophy  He <a id="l341"></a>colludes in the significations of words ✝ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 565r &gt; </span>✝ calling those things miracles which create no wonder &amp; those things occult <a id="l342"></a>qualities whos causes are occult tho the qualities themselves be manifest, &amp; <a id="l343"></a>those things the souls of men which do not animate their bodies.

At that time he did not deny what M<sup>r</sup> Fatio affirmed, &amp; nothing but want of candor can make him unconstant to himself.</p>
<p id="par60">In a Letter to me dated 7 March 1693 &amp; now in the custody of the R.

And what he then acknowledged he ought still to <a id="l386"></a>acknowledge.</p>
<p id="par61">In his Letter of 21 Iune 1677 writ in Answer to mine of 24 Octob <a id="l387"></a>1676 wherein I had described  my method partly in plain words &amp; partly <a id="l388"></a>in cyphers, he said that he agreed with  me that the method of tangents <a id="l389"></a>of Slusius was not yet made perfect, &amp; then set down a differential method <a id="l390"></a>of Tangents published by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in the year 1670, &amp; disguised it by a new <a id="l391"></a>notation, pretending that it was his own &amp; shewed how it might be improved so as to perform those things <a id="l392"></a>which I had ascribed to my method, &amp; concluded from thence that mine differed <a id="l393"></a>not much from his, especially since it faciliated Quadratures. And in the <a id="l394"></a>Acta Eruditorum for October 184, in publishing the Elements of this method <a id="l395"></a>he added that it extended to the difficulter Problemes which without this <a id="l396"></a>Method or another like it, could not be managed so easily. He understood <a id="l397"></a>therefore in those days that in the eyar 1676 when I wrote my said Letter <a id="l398"></a>I had a method which did the same things with the method which he calls <a id="l399"></a>differentiall, &amp; he ought still to acknowledge it, ‖, especially <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 565r &gt; </span>‖ especially now the sentences in cyphers are decyphered &amp; other things in that Letter <a id="l400"></a>relating to the method are fully explained, &amp; the Compendium mentioned therein <a id="l401"></a>is made publick.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 564v resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par62">In his Letter of 27 Aug. 1676 he represented that he did not beleive <a id="l402"></a>that my Methods were so generall as I had described them in my Letter of <a id="l403"></a>13 Iune preceding, &amp; affirmed that  there were many Pro<a id="l404"></a>blemes so difficult that they did not depend upon Equations nor Quadra<a id="l405"></a>tures, such as (amongst many others) were the inverse Problemes of tan<a id="l406"></a>gents. And by these words  he acknowledged that he had not yet found the <a id="l407"></a>reduction of Problems to Differential Equations. And what he then acknow<a id="l408"></a>ledged, he acknowledged again in the Acta Eruditorum for April 1691 pag. <a id="l409"></a>178, &amp; ought in candor to acknowledge still.</p>
<p id="par63">D<sup>r</sup> Wallis in the Preface to the two first Volumes of his works published <a id="l410"></a>in April 1695, wrote that I in my two Letters written in the year 1676 had <a id="l411"></a>explained to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the Method (called by me the  method of fluxions <a id="l412"></a>&amp; by him the differential method) invented by me ten years before or above <a id="l413"></a>(that is, in the year 1666 or before) &amp; in the Letters which followed between <a id="l414"></a>them, M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had notice of this Paragraph &amp; did not then contradict it <a id="l415"></a>nor found any fault with it. And I expect that he still forbeare to contra<a id="l416"></a>dict it.</p>
<p id="par64">But as he has lately attaqued me with an accusation which amounts <a id="l417"></a>to plagiary: if he goes on to accuse me, it lies upon him by the laws of <a id="l418"></a>all nations to prove his accusation on pain of being accounted guilty of <a id="l419"></a>calumny. He hath hitherto written Letters to his correspondents full of affirmations <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p565r"> &lt;565r&gt; </span> complaints &amp; reflexions without proving any thing. But he is the aggressor <a id="l420"></a>&amp; it lies upon him to prove his charge.</p>
<p id="par65">I forbear to descend further into particulars. You have them in the <a id="l421"></a>Commercium Epistolicum &amp; the Abstract thereof, to both which I refer you. I <a id="l422"></a>am</p>

<p id="par69" class="i0">Sir</p>
<p id="par70">I thank you for shewing me the Postscript to the Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz. And for setting <a id="l424"></a>those matters in a true light,  I  will lay them before you <a id="l425"></a>in an historical manner in as few words as I can .</p>
<p id="par71"> I gave an Example of the method of fluxions in  my Analysis <a id="l426"></a>communicated by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> Collins in the year 1669, &amp; described the univer<a id="l427"></a>sality of it in  my Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Collins dated 10 Decem 1672 with an exam<a id="l428"></a>ple thereof in drawing of Tangents, a copy of which Letter was sent to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l429"></a>Leibnitz at Paris   by M<sup>r</sup> Old. in the same Packet with My  Letter of 13 Iune 1676 &amp; therefore was received by him. In this Letter I said.</p>
<p id="par72">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz was in London in February 1673 &amp; after a few days went <a id="l430"></a>thence to Paris, &amp; at that time &amp; some time after  he knew nothing of the higher Geometry, but some <a id="l431"></a>time after (suppose in the year 1674) was instructed in it at Paris by M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l432"></a>Huygens as he represents in his  Postscript above mentioned. In those days M<sup>r</sup> Collins <a id="l433"></a>communicated to his friends  at home &amp; abroad several Series invented by  <a id="l434"></a> me &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Iames Gregory. And   one of these series namely that for  finding any Arc whose sine  is given &amp; by consequence the <a id="l436"></a>whole circumference  when its proportion to that arc is given, M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in the year 1674 signified that he had invented such a series. And thereupon M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg  sent eight series invented by  &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Iames <a id="l438"></a>Gregory, to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in a letter dated 15 Apr. 1675, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in <a id="l439"></a>a Letter dated 20 May 1715 acknowledged the receipt thereof, &amp; said he <a id="l440"></a>would compare those series with his own but the same year communicated to his friends at Paris one of those series as his own <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>w<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>. And the next year M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz, <a id="l441"></a>upon receiving two others of those series a second time from London, desired <a id="l442"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburgh (by a letter dated 12 May 1676) to procure from M<sup>r</sup> Collins <a id="l443"></a>the Demonstration of those two series, meaning the method of finding <a id="l444"></a>them; &amp; promised to recompence him with something of his own very <a id="l445"></a>different. One of the two series of which he wanted the Demonstration <a id="l446"></a>was that for finding the Arc whose sine was given. He pretended two <a id="l447"></a>yeares before to have found this series himself &amp; now he wanted the method <a id="l448"></a>of finding it. The series which he sent back as a recompence was <a id="l449"></a>one of those which he had received from M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg the year before <a id="l450"></a>&amp; did not then know to be his own but the same year communicated it to his friends at Paris as his own &amp; afterwards published in the Acta Eruditorum as his own without letting the world know that he had received it from London. Vpon this request of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz M<sup>r</sup> Newton  <a id="l451"></a>wrote his Letter of 13 Iune 1676 conteining his method of Seires illustra<a id="l452"></a>ted with divers examples of Series. And M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  in his Answer dated <span class="hspac-n" title="4 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> claimed <a id="l453"></a>four of the series, pretending that he had found them before he received <a id="l454"></a>the Letter, that is, before he had the method of finding them. And when at <a id="l455"></a>his request M<sup>r</sup> Newton further explained the inverse method of series,  <a id="l456"></a>so soon as he understood it, he replied that he had found it before as he <a id="l457"></a>perceived by his old papers, but had forgot it.</p>
<p id="par73">M<sup>r</sup> Newton neare the end of his said Letter of 13 Iune 1676, repre<a id="l458"></a>sented that <em class="underline">Analysis</em> by the help of these series, extended to allmost all problems <a id="l459"></a>but yet became not universall without  some further methods. And in his <a id="l460"></a>next Letter dated Octob. 24, he said that <em class="underline">one of those Methods consisted in the <a id="l461"></a>extraction of a fluent out of an Equation involving its</em> fluxion: &amp; the other <a id="l462"></a><em class="underline">the Probleme</em>. The first method shews that when M<sup>r</sup> Newton wrote these two <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p566v"> &lt;566v&gt; </span> Letters he had  fluxional equations &amp; had then carried Analysis in such equati<a id="l463"></a>ons to a very great height &amp; by this Analysis had improved the Method of Series &amp; made it general. The second method is that which M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l464"></a>in his letter to you claims to himself, saying that  M<sup>r</sup> Newton indeed <a id="l465"></a>preceded him in the method of series, but at length he (M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz) found a <a id="l466"></a>general method for series &amp; after this he had no more need of M<sup>r</sup> Newton's <a id="l467"></a>extractions.   <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from above the line &gt; </span>But this Method being M<sup>r</sup> Newtons M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz has no right to any part of the method of Se<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p567r-a"> &lt;567r&gt; </span>ries<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 566v resumes &gt; </span></p>
<p id="par74">M<sup>r</sup> Newton in his said Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 mentioned his Analysis com<a id="l470"></a>municated by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> Collins &amp; another Tract composed in the year 1671 about <a id="l471"></a>Series &amp;  a method of Tangents which readily gave the method of Slusius, &amp; stuck not <a id="l472"></a>at surds &amp; extended to questions de maximis &amp; minimis &amp; quadratures &amp; others &amp; was <a id="l473"></a>obvious or easy to be found out &amp; was founded in the slution of this Probleme <a id="l474"></a>[Data Æquatione quotcunque fluentes quantitates involvente, Fluxiones invenire &amp; <a id="l475"></a>vice versa.] This is therefore the method of Fluxions whereof M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz now <a id="l476"></a>pretends to have been the first inventor calling it the differential method. This is that <a id="l477"></a>method which M<sup>r</sup> Newton  in his Letter of 10 Decem 1672 called his general method <a id="l478"></a>&amp; said that it not only determined Tangents, but  extended also to abstruser <a id="l479"></a>Problems concerning the Curvities, Areas Lengths Centers of gravity of Curves <a id="l480"></a>&amp;c &amp; proceeded even in  Mechanical Curves &amp; in Equations involving surds. <a id="l481"></a>And the things which M<sup>r</sup> Newton in his Letter of 24 Octob 1676 cited out of his <a id="l482"></a>book of Quadratures shew that he had in those days carried the fluxional <a id="l483"></a>Analysis to a higher pitch then M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; his followers have been able to carry <a id="l484"></a>the differential Analysis to this day.</p>
<p id="par75">M<sup>r</sup> Newton's Letter of 10 Decem 1672 was sent by M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l485"></a>Leibnitz in the same packet with his Letter of 13 Iune 1672, &amp; therefore  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz received <a id="l486"></a>it. In October following he came from Paris to London &amp; there M<sup>r</sup> Collins shewed <a id="l487"></a>him a part of his correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Gregory &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Newton as he acknowledges in <a id="l488"></a>his Letter to you, &amp; particularly he shewed him M<sup>r</sup> Newton's Letter of 24 October <a id="l489"></a>just then  received by M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg &amp; given to M<sup>r</sup> Collins to be copied. For <a id="l490"></a>the sentence concerning M<sup>r</sup> Newton's ignorance of the dimensions of the vulgar <a id="l491"></a>figures except the Cissoid, is in this Letter. You may see it in the Commercium pag. <a id="l492"></a>74. And therefore M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz has injured the Committee of the R. Society in <a id="l493"></a>complaining that they  suppressed it. And if you please to  consult the place, you <a id="l494"></a>will see that the construction which he puts upon it, is as injurious to M<sup>r</sup> Newton, whose <a id="l495"></a>words are: <em class="underline">Sed in simplicioribus vulgoque celebratis figuris, vix aliquid relatu <a id="l496"></a>dignum reperi quod evasit aliorum conatus, nisi forte Longitudo Cissoidis ejusmodi <a id="l497"></a> censeatur</em>.</p>
<p id="par76">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Letter to you represents that if the Differential method <a id="l498"></a>had been hinted to M<sup>r</sup> Newton it would have been easy for him to have found it <a id="l499"></a>out. And certainly it was as easy for M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz by the hints which he had of <a id="l500"></a>the fluxional method in M<sup>r</sup> Newtons Letters above mentioned to find out that method, <a id="l501"></a>notwithstanding that the sentences above set down within the brackets were in <a id="l502"></a>ciphers. In his journey therefore from London through Holland to Hannover, he was <a id="l503"></a>meditating how to  extend the method of Tangents &amp; particularly that of Slusius  <a id="l504"></a>to all sorts of Problems, &amp; first proposed to do it by a Table of tangents as appears <a id="l505"></a>by his Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg dated from Amsterdam 18 Novem. 1676, but after his <a id="l506"></a>arrival at Hannover he fell into the true method of doing it; as he himself has <a id="l507"></a>acknowledged in the Acta Eruditorum for April 1691 pag. 178, where he saith that <a id="l508"></a>by new matter &amp; other affairs coming on he was hindred from fitting his  arithmetical <a id="l509"></a>Quadrature for the Press, &amp; after he found his new Analysis he did not think that Quadrature <a id="l510"></a>worth publishing in the vulgar manner. In his Letter of 27 Aug. 1676 he  <a id="l511"></a>wondred that M<sup>r</sup> Newton should pretend to such general methods, &amp; affirmed <a id="l512"></a>that Inverse Problemes &amp; many others could not be reduced to equations or <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p567r-b"> &lt;567r&gt; </span> quadratures: but after he returned to Hannover &amp; fell into publick business <a id="l513"></a>he found out how to reduce such Problems to equations &amp; quadratures &amp; in <a id="l514"></a>his Letter of 21 Iune 1677 sent back a specimen of his new method, pre<a id="l515"></a>tending (according to his usual candor) that he had found it long before. <a id="l516"></a>Clarissimi Slusij Methodum Tangentium, saith he, nondum esse absolutam <a id="l517"></a>Newtono assentior. Et jam a multo tempore rem Tangentium generalius <a id="l518"></a>tractavi, scilicet per differentias Ordinatarum. Then he sets down his new <a id="l519"></a>method of Tangents &amp; how it gives the method of Slusius, &amp; adds that it is of lar<a id="l520"></a>ger extent then his former method of Tangents &amp; shews how it proceeds (like <a id="l521"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton's method) without taking away surds, &amp; then adds <em class="underline">Arbitror quæ <a id="l522"></a>celare voluit Newtonus de Tangentibus ducendis ab his non abludere. Quod addit, <a id="l523"></a>ex hoc eodem fundamento quadraturas quoque reddi faciliores me in sententia hac <a id="l524"></a>confirmat, nimirum semper figuræ illæ sunt quadrabiles quæ sunt ad æquationem <a id="l525"></a>differentialem</em>. M<sup>r</sup> Newton in his Letter of 24 Octob 1676 represented that he had <a id="l526"></a>a general method  upon which he had written a Treatis five years before, &amp; that this was <a id="l527"></a>a certain method of Tangents which extended to all sorts of Problems &amp; readily gave the <a id="l528"></a>method of Slusius &amp; stuck not at surds &amp;  faciliated Quadratures. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l529"></a>at length finds a method of Tangents which did the same things &amp; thence <a id="l530"></a>concludes it like the method which M<sup>r</sup> Newton had described in his Letters &amp; <a id="l531"></a>concealed in this sentence exprest enigmatically, Data æquatione quotcunque <a id="l532"></a>fluentes quantitates involvente, fluxiones invenire, &amp; vice versa. But now <a id="l533"></a>he contends either that M<sup>r</sup> Newton when he wrote those Letters had no such <a id="l534"></a>method, or that the Differential method was found [jam tum a multo tempore] long before the year 1677.</p>
<p id="par77">When the Differential Method began to be celebrated in Holland D<sup>r</sup> Wallis <a id="l535"></a>in the Introduction to his Works printed in the year 1695, wrote that this method <a id="l536"></a>was the same with the Method of fluxions which M<sup>r</sup> Newton had explained to <a id="l537"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Letters written in the year 1676, &amp; had invented then <a id="l538"></a>years before that time or above. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in the correspondence which <a id="l539"></a>followed between him &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Wallis did not deny this nor contend for any thing <a id="l540"></a>more then that he had added some things to M<sup>r</sup> Newton's method, &amp; that what <a id="l541"></a>he had added was his own.</p>
<p id="par78">Afterwards in the year 1699 M<sup>r</sup> Fatio published that M<sup>r</sup> Newton was the <a id="l542"></a>oldest inventor of this Calculus by many years &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the second Inventor <a id="l543"></a>And M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his Answer published in the Acta Eruditorum for May 1710, did <a id="l544"></a>not dispute it, but  commended M<sup>r</sup> Newton for his candor  <a id="l545"></a>in his Principia Philosophiæ (pag. 258, 259)  where he represented that upon signifying to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l546"></a>Leibnitz  in the year 1676 that he had a method of determining Maxima &amp; mi<a id="l547"></a>nima, drawing Tangents, &amp; solving such like Problems which proceeded without taking away <a id="l548"></a>surds &amp; concealing the method in this sentence exprest enigmatically [Data æquatione <a id="l549"></a>quotcunque fluentes quantitates involvente, fluxiones invenire, &amp; vice versa:] M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l550"></a>Leibnitz wrote back [the next year] that he had also fallen into such a method &amp;  communicated <a id="l551"></a>his method scarce differing from M<sup>r</sup> Newton's except in forms of words &amp; chcara<a id="l552"></a>ters: &amp; that the foundation of both  methods was continued in the second <a id="l553"></a>Lemma of the second book of his Principles p 250. By commending M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l554"></a>for his candor in making this Representation, he acknowledged the truth of <a id="l555"></a>the Representation: &amp; its now too late to dispute it. All that he can now <a id="l556"></a>pretend to is that he found the differential method [a multo tempore] long before the year 1677 <a id="l557"></a>or at least that he has added some things to M<sup>r</sup> Newton's method &amp; that what he has added is his own. In either case he is to prove what he pretends to.</p>
<p id="par79">In the same Answer to M<sup>r</sup> Fatio, M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz wrote: Quam [methodum] <a id="l558"></a>ante Dominum Newtonum et me nullus quod sciam Geometra habuit; uti ante <a id="l559"></a>hunc maximi nominis Geometriam Nemo Specimine publice dato se habere proba<a id="l560"></a>vit: ante Dominos Bernoullios et me nullus communicavit. Bernoulli is here made <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p567v"> &lt;567v&gt; </span> a party &amp; therefore can be no judge, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Newton is here acknowledged to have <a id="l561"></a>been the first who by giving a publick specimen proved that he had this method. When <a id="l562"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz first published his method (viz<sup>t</sup> A.C. 1684) he extended it no further then <a id="l563"></a>to Tangents &amp; maxima &amp; minima, but added that it  might be extended to the difficulter pro<a id="l564"></a>blems, which could not be solved without this calculus or another like it, meaning M<sup>r</sup> Newton's <a id="l565"></a>years before. But neither of them proved the extent of their method to the difficulter Problems by a publick <a id="l566"></a>specimen before the edition of the Principia Philosophiæ, which the Marquess de l'Hos<a id="l567"></a>pital acknowledged to  consist almost wholy of this calculus. <a id="l568"></a>And M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz himself in his Letter from Hanover to M<sup>r</sup> Newton 17 Mach 1693 <a id="l569"></a>now in the custody of the R. Society,  wrote thus concerning it: Mirifice ampliave<a id="l570"></a>ras Geometriam tuis seriebus, sed edito Principiorum opere ostendisti patere tibi etiam <a id="l571"></a>quæ Analysi receptæ non subsunt. Conatus sum ego quoque notis commodis adhibitis <a id="l572"></a>quæ differentias &amp; summas exhibeant, Geometriam illam quam transcendentem <a id="l573"></a>appello Analysi quodammodo subjicere: nec res male processit. His first endea<a id="l574"></a>vour to do this was in his thre papers published in the year 1689 de lineis Opticis, <a id="l575"></a>de resistentia Medij &amp; de motuum cœlestium causis. In the end of the second of <a id="l576"></a>these Papers he said: Nobis nunc fundamenta Geometrica jecisse suffecerit in quibus <a id="l577"></a>maxima consistebat difficultas. Et fortasse attente consideranti vias quasdem novas <a id="l578"></a>vel certe satis antea impeditas aperuisse videbimur. Omnia autem respondent nostræ <a id="l579"></a>Analysi Infinitorum &amp;c. This was the first specimen which he published of the extent of his <a id="l580"></a>method to the difficulter Problems. It was writ in plain words &amp; answered <a id="l581"></a>to the Analysis infinitorum in imitation of M<sup>r</sup> Newton's Principia Philosophiæ <a id="l582"></a>writ in the same manner. For these three Papers were nothing else then <a id="l583"></a>a part of the Principia Philosophiæ put into a new dress. As M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l584"></a>by imitating M<sup>r</sup> Newton invented the differential calculus, so he imitated him in <a id="l585"></a>the first specimen which he gave of the extent of this calculus.</p>
<p id="par80">In October 1703 D<sup>r</sup> Wallis died, the last of the old men who corresponded <a id="l586"></a>with M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburgh &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Collins in these matters. And hitherto M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l587"></a>forbore to claim the precedency of invention, &amp; contented himself with <a id="l588"></a>pretending that he had invented the method apart &amp; augmented it. But heh <a id="l589"></a>has since begun (according to his usual candor) to contradict D<sup>r</sup> Wallis &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Fatio &amp; <a id="l590"></a>represent M<sup>r</sup> Newton a Plagiary, &amp; now refuses to make good his accusation, pre<a id="l591"></a>tending that he will not oblige the English so far &amp; that the Committee of the <a id="l592"></a>Royall Society are not legal judges. That he might not seem to have received <a id="l593"></a>any light into the differential method from M<sup>r</sup> Newtons Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 <a id="l594"></a>he said in his Answer, A multo tempore rem tangentium generalius tractavi, scilicet <a id="l595"></a>per differentias Ordinatarum, I have long ago made the method of Tangents by <a id="l596"></a>the differences of the Ordinates become a general methods. And now he goes a step fur<a id="l597"></a>ther &amp; pretends that he made the method general not only without receiving <a id="l598"></a>light from M<sup>r</sup> Newton, but even before him. He confesses that he knew nothing <a id="l599"></a>of the higher Geometry  in the year 1673 when he went from London to Paris, &amp; <a id="l600"></a>that in the year 1675 he composed his Quadratura Arithmetica in a vulgar man<a id="l601"></a>ner before he found out his new Analysis, &amp; that in the year 1676 he knew not <a id="l602"></a>how to reduce inverse Problemes of Tangents to equations or quadratures: &amp; yet he <a id="l603"></a>pretends that he found out the new Analysis not only without receiving light from <a id="l604"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Newton but even before him. But it lies upon him to prove his pretenses. <a id="l605"></a>And finding himself unable to do this, he seeks excuses &amp; makes a clamour. <a id="l606"></a>But he is to know that by the laws of all nations he that accuses another <a id="l607"></a>publickly &amp; doth not prove his accusation as publickly, is to be accounted <a id="l608"></a>guilty of calumny. And thus much in answer to the first part of his Post<a id="l609"></a>script.</p>

<p id="par88">The method of converging Series &amp; the Method of Fluxions <a id="l657"></a>have great affinity with one another, so as both together to compose one <a id="l658"></a>universal Analysis &amp; separately to be imperfect. I found them both in the <a id="l659"></a>years 1665 &amp; 1666 by degrees. And in Iuly 1699 D<sup>r</sup> Barrow communicated <a id="l660"></a>to  M<sup>r</sup> Collins a little Tract of Analysis written by me in which I  <a id="l661"></a>founded the method of Series upon three Rules &amp; demmonstrated the first Rule <a id="l662"></a>by the method of fluxions. And in the year 1671 I wrote a larger Tract <a id="l663"></a>upon these two methods, with a designe to have published it together with <a id="l664"></a>another Tract concerning Light &amp; Colours. But finding that these matters <a id="l665"></a>began to entangle me in disputes I laid my designe aside being in love with <a id="l666"></a>a quiet life,  as I represented in my Letter of 24 October 1676</p>
<p id="par89">In the year 1669, 1670, 1671 &amp; 1672 M<sup>r</sup> Collins communicated to his <a id="l667"></a>friends at home &amp; abroad several series partly taken out of the said Tract of Analysis <a id="l668"></a>&amp; partly sent to him by M<sup>r</sup> Iames Gregory of Scotland. For M<sup>r</sup>. Gregory by <a id="l669"></a>the help of one of my Series fell into the same Method of converging Series. <a id="l670"></a>And in a Letter to M<sup>r</sup> Collins dated 10 Decem 1672 I described the universali<a id="l671"></a>ty of the Method of fluxions saying that it extended to Problemes <a id="l672"></a>about the Tangents, Curvities, Areas, Lengths, Centers of gravity of Curves  <a id="l673"></a>Geometrical or Mechanical &amp;c &amp; proceeded without taking away surds. And <a id="l674"></a>I there gave an example of this method in drawing of Tangents by a Rule which proved to be the Method of Slusius. And a <a id="l675"></a>copy of this Letter was sent to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz at Paris by M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg <a id="l676"></a>in the same Packet with   my Letter of Iune 13<sup>th</sup> 1676, &amp; therefore <a id="l677"></a>it came to h is hands. And these two Letters (if I mistake not)  gave him the first notice of such a general method of Analysis</p>
<p id="par90">He was in London in Feb 1673 &amp; there pretended to  the method of Mouton, &amp; after a few days went thence <a id="l680"></a>to Paris &amp; staid there some time before he knew any thing of the higher <a id="l681"></a>Geometry, but at length ( I think in the year 1674) he was instructed in <a id="l682"></a>it at Paris by M<sup>r</sup> Hugens, as he represents in his Postscript above menti<a id="l683"></a>oned.  And then he wrote  For he began that year to write to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg about the higher Geometry pretending that that he could find a series for any Arch whose <a id="l685"></a>sine was known. If the proportion of the Arc to the whole circum<a id="l686"></a>ference was known it gave him the whole circumference, if the pro<a id="l687"></a>portion was not known yet the series gave him the Arc. And this <a id="l688"></a>he pretended to be his own invention,  but did not yet to know the <a id="l689"></a>Method of   inventing it. For in his Letter of 12 May 1676 <a id="l690"></a>he desired M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg to procure from M<sup>r</sup> Collins the method <a id="l691"></a>of finding this very series &amp; tos end it to him. He is desired to let us know how to came by that series two years before he had the method of finding it</p>
<p id="par91">In a Letter dated April 15<sup>th</sup> 1675 M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg sent to M<sup>r</sup>  Leibnits <a id="l692"></a>from M<sup>r</sup> Collins eight series invented, some of them by me, &amp; others by M<sup>r</sup> Gregory. And M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l693"></a>in a Letter dated 20 May following, &amp; still extant acknowledged the receipt thereof, &amp; said <a id="l694"></a>he would compare those series with his own. At that time he did not know any <a id="l695"></a>of those series to be his own; &amp; yet the same yeare he communicated one of <a id="l696"></a>them to his friends at Paris as his own &amp; afterwards published it in Germany as <a id="l697"></a>his own without ever acknowledging that he had received it from London.

<p id="par92">Vpon the aforesaid request of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg &amp; <a id="l699"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Collins wrote to me to communicate my method of Series to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz, &amp; I <a id="l700"></a>did so in my Letter of 13 Iune 1676, &amp; therin I added that  Analysis by  <a id="l701"></a>means of this method was much enlarged so as to extend to almost all Problems <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p569dr"> &lt;569r&gt; </span> except perhaps some numeral ones like those of Diophantus, but became <a id="l702"></a>not universal without the help of some further methods of reducing Problems to converging series which  I forbore to describe, having tired my <a id="l703"></a>self with these studies long ago so  to have absteined from them the last <a id="l704"></a>five years, meaning since the year 1671. And M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his <a id="l705"></a>Answer dated 27 Aug. 1676 replied that he did not beleive that M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l706"></a>Newton's Method was so general: for (said he) there  were many Problems <a id="l707"></a>so difficult as not to depend upon Equations or Quadratures, such as <a id="l708"></a>are (among many others) the inverse Problemes of Tangents. And by these <a id="l709"></a>words its most certain that M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz had not yet found out the <a id="l710"></a>Differential method. In the same <a id="l711"></a> Answer he  pretended to have found some of th<span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>ese<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> series before he received them from me, that is before he had the method of finding them.</p> 
<p id="par93">In my Answer dated 24 Octob. 1676, at the request of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l712"></a>I described how I found out the Method of Series a little before the Plague <a id="l713"></a>which happened in the year 1665. And after I had mentioned the aforesaid <a id="l714"></a>Tract  communicated by D<sup>r</sup> Barrow to M<sup>r</sup> Collins, (which has been since <a id="l715"></a>printed from a copy found in the hand writing of M<sup>r</sup> Collins by M<sup>r</sup> Iones <a id="l716"></a>who purchased  his Library) &amp; the other Tract written  upon both the methods in the year 1671: I added that the Method of fluxions readily <a id="l718"></a>gave the method of Tangents of Slusius &amp; determined Maxima &amp; Minima <a id="l719"></a>&amp; Quadratures &amp; other hard Problemes, &amp; stuck not at Equations involving surds. <a id="l720"></a>&amp; was easy to be found. And because I was not then at leasure to describe it at <a id="l721"></a>large I couched it in the following Probleme exprest  Enigmatically <a id="l722"></a><em class="underline">An Equation involving any number of fluent quantities being given, to find <a id="l723"></a>their fluxions; &amp; on the contrary.</em> This is the first Proposition of my book <a id="l724"></a>of Quadratures. And in this Letter I cited so many things out of that Book <a id="l725"></a>as abundantly shews that that Book was then written &amp; what was the method of fluxions which I wrote of in that Letter. And in the end of the Letter <a id="l726"></a>I added that  Inverse Problemes of Tangents &amp; others more difficult   <a id="l727"></a> were in my power by the help <a id="l728"></a>of two methods, which methods I couched in the following words exprest enigmatically. <a id="l729"></a><em class="underline">One method consists in the extraction of a fluent quantity out of an equation involving its <a id="l730"></a>fluxion</em>: <em class="underline">the other in assuming a Series for any unknown quantity from <a id="l731"></a>which the  rest  may conveniently be deduced &amp; in <a id="l732"></a>collating the homologous terms of the resulting æquation</em>  <em class="underline">for  determining the terms of the assumed series</em>. By these two <a id="l734"></a>methods I had made the inverse method of Series  become general five years before the writing <a id="l735"></a>of that  letter or above. The first method shews not only that I had fluxional <a id="l736"></a>equations in those days, but also that I had then carried the inverse method of fluxions to a <a id="l737"></a>great degree of perfection. The second method is now claimed from me by M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l738"></a>For in h is aforesaid Postscript he  allows that I preceded him in the <a id="l739"></a>method of series, but he adds that at length he found a general method for <a id="l740"></a>series &amp; after that he had no further need of my extractions. This General method <a id="l741"></a>he described in the Acta Eruditorum for April 1693 pag. 178. And it is the same <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p569v"> &lt;569v&gt; </span> with mine. </p>
<p id="par94">He came to London the second time in October 1676  &amp; before <a id="l745"></a>he went from thence  into Holland  M<sup>r</sup> Collins shewed him a <a id="l746"></a>part of his correspondence with M<sup>r</sup> Gregory &amp; me  as he tells you in <a id="l747"></a>his Postscript. And  there he saw my aforesaid Reply or Letter of 24 October 1676 just then <a id="l748"></a>received by M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg &amp; put into the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins, I suppose to <a id="l749"></a>be copied. For he tells you that  in the  papers which <a id="l750"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Collins shewed him he observed that I acknowledged my ignorance in <a id="l751"></a>many things &amp; said among other things that I had found nothing about <a id="l752"></a>the dimension of the celebrated Curves besides the dimension of the  Cissoid. And this passage is  in the said Letter of  24 Octob 1676. <a id="l754"></a>Whether M<sup>r</sup> Collins did not at the same time shew him my Analysis <a id="l755"></a>may be doubted. For that Analysis was the fountain of all the corres<a id="l756"></a>pondence about Series.  He complains that all this passage about my pretended igno<a id="l757"></a>rance was omitted by the Committee of the R. Society, &amp; gives this as an <a id="l758"></a>instance of the  partiality of the Committee in not printing  the Letters <a id="l759"></a>entire. But he accuses them  injuriously for the passage is printed entire <a id="l760"></a>in the Commercium Epistolicum pag. 74.  My Letter of 10 Decem. 1672 is printed entire  The Letters of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz <a id="l761"></a>dated 15 Iuly 1674, 26 Octob 1674, 12 Iuly 1675 28 Decem 1675, 27 Aug. <a id="l762"></a>1676, 18 Novem 1676, 21 Iune 1677 &amp; 12 Iuly 1677 &amp; those of M<sup>r</sup> Newton <a id="l763"></a>dated 13  Iune 1676 &amp; 24 Octob 1676 have been printed entire by D<sup>r</sup> <a id="l764"></a>Wallis   without any dispute arising upon them &amp;  they that please <a id="l765"></a>to compare them with the excerpta taken out of them by the Committee  of the R. Society will find that nothing of moment  <a id="l767"></a> to the controversy has been omitted by them. And that of <a id="l768"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg dated 15 Apr. 1675 &amp; those of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz  extant in his own hand writing &amp; dated 20 May 1675 &amp; 12 May 1676 have <a id="l770"></a>been  collated with the extracts in the presence <a id="l771"></a>of many Gentlemen of Germany Italy France &amp; England you your self <a id="l772"></a>being  one of them. And these being all the Letters of Moment <a id="l773"></a>(for those of M<sup>r</sup> Collins written in the years 1669, 1670, 1671 &amp; 1672 were <a id="l774"></a> only to show how free he was in communicating the Series which he had <a id="l775"></a>received from me &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Gregory) it is evident that the complaint of <a id="l776"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz against the Committee of the R. Society is  frivolous &amp;  injurious. <a id="l777"></a></p>
<p id="par95">M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in his aforesaid Postscript saith that it would have been easy <a id="l779"></a>for me to have found out the differential method if  it had been hinted <a id="l780"></a>to me. And this is an acknowledgment that it was easy for him to find it out by the light which I gave him into it. For  in my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 I hinted the method to him very <a id="l781"></a>plainly &amp; said it was obvious.  I gave him so much light into it that D<sup>r</sup> Wallis in the Preface to the two first <a id="l782"></a>Volumes of his works printed above 20 years ago said that in my two Letters written  in the year 1676 I explained <a id="l783"></a>to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz that Method found by me ten years before that year or above. And M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l784"></a>Leibnitz in the Letters which followed thereupon between him &amp;  Doctor Wallis did not <a id="l785"></a>deny what the Doctor had affirmed, nor blame him for it nor made the least dispute about it, but said <a id="l786"></a>only that he had added to my method as Des Cartes had added to the Analysis of <a id="l787"></a>Vieta.</p>

<p id="par100">Sir</p>
<p id="par101">The more I consider the Postscript of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the less I think <a id="l793"></a>it deserves an answer. For it is nothing but a piece of railery from the <a id="l794"></a>beginning to the end.  He saith that it doth not appear that I had the <a id="l797"></a> infinitesimal Characteristique  &amp;  Analysis before him, but  <a id="l798"></a> he is to prove  that he had it before me. For he has accu<a id="l799"></a>sed me of plagiary before the R. S. &amp; by the laws of all nations he is guilty of calumny if <a id="l800"></a>he doth not prove his accusation. He appeals  from the judgment <a id="l801"></a>of the Committee of the R. S. to the judgment of M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli    <a id="l803"></a> But N Bernoulli claims <a id="l804"></a>a share with M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in the  infinitesimal method,  <a id="l805"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli hath erred &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Wallis above 20 years ago gave a contrary judgment. &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Keill hath shewed that. He saith that it was easy for me to have found <a id="l806"></a>the Method before him if it had been notified to me: &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Wallis said <a id="l807"></a>above 20 years ago that I  explained it to M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz in the year 1676. He saith that <a id="l808"></a>the Committee of the R. Society have  attacked his candor <a id="l809"></a>by misrepresentations,  &amp; that he will not answer their little reasons: but <a id="l810"></a>thethey that read the Papers printed by the Committee with their Observations upon them will <a id="l811"></a>find that the  whole is matter of fact which admits of no answer. <a id="l812"></a>He complains that  in falling upon series they go from the fact, but <a id="l813"></a>the Question is whether M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz or I be guilty of Plagiary <a id="l814"></a>&amp; what they say about series is very apposite to decide that Question <a id="l815"></a>He insists upon his own candor &amp;  endeavours to make himself a witness in his own c &amp; they speak <a id="l816"></a>to the credit of the witness.  On the other  hand he himself is guilty of what he <a id="l817"></a>complains of in others. For he goes from the fact both when he falls foul <a id="l818"></a>upon my Philosophy, &amp; when he sends mathematical Problems to try <a id="l819"></a>who was the best Mathematician 45 or 50 years ago when he knew nothing of Geometry. He   saith that <a id="l820"></a>I invented series before him but at length he found a general method <a id="l821"></a>after which he had no further need of my extractions. But  this <a id="l822"></a>general method is mine. It is mentioned in my Letters of 13 Iune &amp; 24 Octob. 1676. He complains that the Comittee of the R. <a id="l823"></a>S. did not print the Letters entire as D<sup>r</sup> Wallis did with his consent: <a id="l824"></a>but it would have been impertinent to print what did not relate to the matter <a id="l825"></a>in hand. He saith that when he came to London  the second <a id="l826"></a>time (which was in Octob. 1676) he saw in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins a <a id="l827"></a>part of his Commerce  with me &amp; Gregory, &amp; there he observed <a id="l828"></a>that I acknowledged my ignorance in many things &amp; particularly <a id="l829"></a>that I  said that I had found nothing about the dimension of the <a id="l830"></a>celebrated Curvi-lineaars besides that of the Cissoid: &amp; that the <a id="l831"></a>Committee had supprest all this.  He alledges this as an  instance that they <a id="l832"></a>had acted partially in omitting things which made against me. But he injures them. For you will find all <a id="l833"></a>this printed in the Commercium Epistolicum pag 74, &amp; I am not <a id="l834"></a>ashamed of it. It is  in my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676 &amp; <a id="l835"></a>therefore he saw that Letter in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins before he <a id="l836"></a>left London. And he might at the same time see my Analysis which <a id="l837"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in the year <a id="l838"></a>1669 communicated to M<sup>r</sup> Collins, &amp; in which <a id="l839"></a>my method of moments &amp; fluxions was described.</p>
<p id="par102">After this he falls foul upon my Philosophy,  that is <a id="l840"></a>upon the Philosophy of the ancient  Phenicians &amp; Greeks as if <a id="l841"></a>they had introduced miracles &amp; occult qualities.  <a id="l842"></a>&amp; <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p571v"> &lt;571v&gt; </span>  tells you that he has proved to M<sup>r</sup> Bayle that the word Miracles signifies not only wonders but also constant events, such as  by <a id="l847"></a>reason of their constancy create no wonder.  He tells you also that God cannot be in the <a id="l848"></a>world without animating the world tho a mans soul according to his Philosophy doth not animate his <a id="l849"></a>body. He accuses me as if I said that  God had a sensorium in <a id="l850"></a>a literal sense. He pretends that all places not filled with tangible bodies <a id="l851"></a>may be filled with an intangible corporeal fluid, that its the fault of the <a id="l852"></a>workman &amp; not of the Watch that it will at length cease, &amp; that it would <a id="l853"></a>be  Gods fault if the world should ever want an amendmente <a id="l854"></a> He commends Experimentall Philosophy &amp; yet adheres to such Hypotheses as <a id="l855"></a>can never be proved by experiments   &amp; brings  <a id="l856"></a>his hypotheses as arguments against things proved  from experiments by  the argument <a id="l857"></a>of Induction &amp; thereby endeavours to overthrow that Philosophy, &amp;  <a id="l858"></a>to set up in its room a heap of precarious Hypotheses which are nothing better <a id="l859"></a>then a Romance.</p>
<p id="par103">But I beg leave to acquaint you that its almost 40 years since I <a id="l860"></a>left of writing Letters about Mathematicks &amp; Philosophy &amp; twenty years <a id="l861"></a>since I left of those studies. And therefore I cannot now suffer my self <a id="l862"></a>to be engaged in disputes of this kind; especially since they are nothing <a id="l863"></a>to the Question in hand, about the infinitesimal method,  For understanding this Question more fully I must <a id="l866"></a>referr you to the Commercium Epistolicum it self &amp; to the Account given <a id="l867"></a>of it in the Phil. Transactions &amp; the Answer of D<sup>r</sup> Keill to the Libel <a id="l868"></a>published in Germany &amp; Holland against the Committee of the R. S.</p>



<p id="par106">He accuses me &amp; by consequence the ancient Phenicians &amp; Greeks  as <a id="l869"></a>if they had introduced miracles &amp; the occult qualities  of the Schoolmen into <a id="l870"></a>Philosophy. And to make this appear he tells us that he has proved to M<sup>r</sup> Bayle <a id="l871"></a>that the word <em class="underline">Miracles</em>, that is <em class="underline">wonders</em>, includes the laws  imprest by God upon <a id="l872"></a>nature tho by their constant acting they create <em class="underline">no wonder</em>, &amp; that the <a id="l873"></a>words <em class="underline">occult qualities</em>  signify qualities which are  not occult but whose <a id="l874"></a>causes be occult tho qualities be  very manifest. He saith that God must be Intelligentia supramundana <a id="l875"></a>because if he were in the world he would be the soul of the  world that is he would animate the world, &amp; yet <a id="l876"></a>according to his Philosophy of an Harmonia præstabilita the soul of a man doth not animate his body <a id="l877"></a>He accuses me  as if I affirmed that God hath a Sensorium in a litteral <a id="l878"></a>sense. He saith that I have not demonstrated  a vacuum nor univer<a id="l879"></a>sal gravity nor Atomes. But  he denyes Conclusions without shewing the fault of the Premisses,    &amp; means that the Argument of Induction from Experiments upon which experimental Philosophy is grounded is not a good one. For I <a id="l880"></a>never attempted to demonstrate any thing universally in natural Philosophy by any stronger <a id="l881"></a>argument then that of Induction from Experiments,  And as for Atomes I never attempted to  demonstrate  them <a id="l882"></a>by this Argument, but put them amongst a set of Quæres. He saith that Space <a id="l883"></a>is the order of coexistences &amp; time the order of successive existences: I suppose he <a id="l884"></a>meanes that space is the order of coexistences in space &amp; time the order <a id="l885"></a>of successive existences in time, or that space is space in space &amp; time is time <a id="l886"></a>in time. He  insinuates that it is the fault of the workman &amp; not of the materials that <a id="l887"></a>a Watch will at length cease to go &amp; in like manner that it would be <a id="l888"></a>Gods fault if the world should ever decay &amp; want an amendment. And by the same way <a id="l889"></a>of arguing a man may say that it would be Gods fault if matter doth not think <a id="l890"></a> He applauds Experimental Philosophy but <a id="l891"></a>recommends Hypotheses to be admitted into Philosophy in order to be examined <a id="l892"></a>by experiments: whereas he should propose not Hypotheses  to be admitted but Questions to be examined  &amp; decided by <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p572r"> &lt;572r&gt; </span> experiments before they are admitted into Philosophy. ✝  ✝ And whilst he  applauds experimental Philosophy &amp; cries out against <a id="l894"></a>miracles, he introduces an  Hypothesis of an Harmonia præstabilita which [is <a id="l895"></a>contrary to the daily experience of all Mankind &amp;]  cannot be true <a id="l896"></a>without an incredible miracle, &amp; which is contrary to the daily experience of all mankind  <a id="l897"></a>  For all men find by experience that they can move their bodies by their will, &amp; that they  see &amp; <a id="l898"></a>hear &amp; feel by means of their bodies. [He is of opinion that <a id="l899"></a>space void of all tangible body may be full of a corporeal intangible fluid <a id="l900"></a>whereas  the Ancients beleived that all things intangible were incor<a id="l901"></a>poreal.  I understand tangibility not in a mathematical but <a id="l902"></a>in a physical sense, such a tangibility as by some resistance can affect the <a id="l903"></a>sense of touching.] He glories in the number of disciples, but  you know <a id="l904"></a>that he has spent his life of making them by a general correspondence <a id="l905"></a>whilst I leave truth to shift for it self. For its almost 40 years since <a id="l906"></a>I left of  all correspondence about Mathematicks &amp; Philosophy &amp; about 20 since I <a id="l907"></a>left of these studies. And for that reason I hope you will pardon me <a id="l908"></a>if I am averse from being engaged in disputes of this kind.</p>
<p id="par107">He sends you also Mathematical Problemes to be solved by the <a id="l909"></a>English Mathematicians. And all this is nothing else then an amusement <a id="l910"></a> to avoid proving his accusation against me &amp;  return<a id="l911"></a>ing a fair answer to the matter of fact which has been published by <a id="l912"></a>order of the R. Society. If he pleases to return such answer, I desire <a id="l913"></a>that he will be constant to himself &amp; continue to acknowledg whatever he <a id="l914"></a>acknowledged above 15 years ago &amp; not contradict what he did not contradict in those days; or else to forbeare  boasting of his candor, <a id="l915"></a>By his Letter of <span class="hspac-n" title="8 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> he acknowledged the receipt of M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburgs Letter <a id="l916"></a>of <span class="hspac-n" title="8 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> &amp; expect that he continue to acknowledge it still. By his Letter <a id="l917"></a>of <span class="hspac-n" title="8 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> he acknowledged that he <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>had<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> not then the method of finding a series for <a id="l918"></a>the arc whose sine was given, &amp; I expect that he acknowledg it still.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p id="par108">He complains that in falling upon series they go from the fact:  <a id="l919"></a>&amp; yet he himself goes from the fact both in falling  upon my Phi<a id="l920"></a>losophy &amp; in sending a Probleme to try who was the best Mathematician <a id="l921"></a>45 or 50 years ago  at which time he understood nothing of  Geometry <a id="l922"></a>The Question is  about M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz's candor &amp; mine &amp; if he <a id="l923"></a>claimed one of my Series as invented by himself  &amp; afterwards wrote to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg  to procure &amp; send to him the method of inventing it; if <a id="l926"></a>he received from London a series  invented by M<sup>r</sup> Gregory &amp; after<a id="l927"></a>wards published it as his own: the world by these  instances may judge <a id="l928"></a>of his candor in being silent 20 years ago when D<sup>r</sup> Wallis told him <a id="l929"></a>that I had  by my Letters in the year 1676 explained to him the  method <a id="l930"></a>of fluxions found by me ten years before or above &amp; now  pretending that he was the first inventor.

Society caused the ancient Letters &amp; <a id="l937"></a>papers extant in their Archives &amp; Letter Books &amp; in the Library of <a id="l938"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Collins to be published, all which are unanswerable matters of fact; instead of  answering the same in a fair manner, &amp; proving his accusation of plagiary a defamatory Libel dated 29 Iuly 1713 was <a id="l939"></a>published  against   me in Germany without the name of <a id="l940"></a>the Author or publisher or City where it was published, &amp; dispersed <a id="l941"></a>over Germany France &amp; Italy, &amp; the Libel it self represents that <a id="l942"></a>M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz set it on foot.  And  instead of proving his accusation he goes on to write defamatory  wrangling Letters.</p>
<p id="par110">In the Latter part of his Postscript he falls foul upon my Philosophy <a id="l943"></a>as if I (&amp; by consequence the ancient Phenicians &amp; Greeks) introduced Miracles  &amp; occult qualities. And <a id="l944"></a>to make this appear he gives the name of <em class="underline">miracles</em> or <em class="underline">wonders</em> to the <a id="l945"></a>laws imprest by God upon nature tho  by reason of their constant working they <a id="l946"></a>create <em class="underline">no wonder</em>, &amp; that of <em class="underline">occult qualities</em> to qualities which are <em class="underline">not occult</em> but whose <a id="l947"></a>causes are occult tho the qualities themselves be very manifest.</p>

<p id="par111" class="i0">Sir</p>
<p id="par112">The more I consider the Postscript of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the less I <a id="l948"></a>think it deserves an answer. For it is nothing but a piece of <a id="l949"></a>railery from the beginning to the end. He saith that it doth not <a id="l950"></a>appear that I had the Infinitesimal Characteristique &amp; Calculus <a id="l951"></a>before him; but he is to prove that he had it before me. For <a id="l952"></a>he has accused me of plagiary  &amp; by the <a id="l953"></a>Laws of all nations he is guilty of calumny if he doth not prove <a id="l954"></a>his accusation. He appeals from the judgment of the Royal Society <a id="l955"></a>to the judgment of his friend M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli: But  D<sup>r</sup> Wallis gave a contrary <a id="l957"></a>judgment above 20 years ago,  without being contradicted till of late, &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Keill hath proved that M<sup>r</sup> Bernoulli <a id="l960"></a>hath erred. M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz saith that it was easy for me tohave found the Method before him if I had been advised of it: <a id="l961"></a>And D<sup>r</sup> Wallis published above 20 years ago that I explained it to M<sup>r</sup> <a id="l962"></a>Leibnitz in the year 1676. He saith that the Committee of the <a id="l963"></a>Royal Society have attaqued his Candor by misrepresentations, &amp; <a id="l964"></a>that he will not answer their little reasons: but they that read <a id="l965"></a>the Papers printed by the Committee with their Observations <a id="l966"></a>upon them, will find that the whole is matter of fact which <a id="l967"></a>admits of no answer. He complains that in falling upon series <a id="l968"></a>they go from the fact, &amp; yet he himself goes from the fact both <a id="l969"></a>in falling upon my Philosophy &amp; in sending a Probleme to try who <a id="l970"></a>was the best Mathematician 45 or 50 years ago, at which time <a id="l971"></a>he understood nothing of Geometry. The Question is about the <a id="l972"></a>candor of M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz &amp; me . And if he claimed one of my <a id="l973"></a>Series as invented by himself, &amp; afterwards wrote to M<sup>r</sup> Oldenburg <a id="l974"></a>to procure &amp; send to him the Method of inventing it; if he <a id="l975"></a>received from London a Series invented by M<sup>r</sup> Gregory, &amp; <a id="l976"></a>afterwards published it as his own: the world by these instan<a id="l977"></a>ces may  judge of his candor in pretending now to be the first <a id="l978"></a>inventor of the  Infinitesimal method, which he did not pretend to till of late. For  21 <a id="l979"></a>years ago when D<sup>r</sup> Wallis had published that I by my Letters <a id="l980"></a>in the year 1676 had explained it to  M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz the infinitesimal method <a id="l981"></a>found by me ten years before or above &amp; given  him notice hereof <a id="l982"></a> he found no fault with what the Doctor had said nor <a id="l983"></a>pretended to any thing more then that he had added some things to my Method <a id="l984"></a>He saith that I invented Series before him, but at length he found <a id="l985"></a>a general method after which he had no further need of my extra<a id="l986"></a>ctions: But this general Method is mine. It is mentioned in my <a id="l987"></a>Letters of 13 Iune &amp; 24 Octob. 1676. He complains that the Committee <a id="l988"></a>of the Royal Society did not print the Letters entire as D<sup>r</sup> Wallis <a id="l989"></a>did with his consent:  &amp; yet it would have been impertinent <a id="l990"></a>to print  such parts of the Letters as did not relate to the <a id="l991"></a>matter in hand. He saith that when he came to London the <a id="l992"></a>second time (which was in October 1676) he saw in the hands of <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p573v"> &lt;573v&gt; </span> M<sup>r</sup> Collins a part of his Commerce with me &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Gregory, &amp; there <a id="l993"></a>he observed that I acknowledged my ignorance in many things &amp; <a id="l994"></a>particularly that I said that I had found nothing about the dimen<a id="l995"></a>sion of the Curvilinear figures besides that of the Cissoid, &amp; that the <a id="l996"></a>Committee had supprest all this. He alledges this as an instance that <a id="l997"></a> they had acted partially in omitting things which made against me. <a id="l998"></a>But he injures them. For you will find all this printed in the <a id="l999"></a>Commercium Epistolicum pag. 74, &amp; I am not ashamed of it. It <a id="l1000"></a>is in my Letter of 24 Octob. 1676, &amp; therefore he saw that Letter <a id="l1001"></a>in the hands of M<sup>r</sup> Collins before he left London. And he might <a id="l1002"></a>at the same time see my Analysis which D<sup>r</sup> Barrow in the year <a id="l1003"></a>1669 communicated to M<sup>r</sup> Collins, &amp; in which my method of moments <a id="l1004"></a>&amp; fluxions was described before M<sup>r</sup> Leibnitz knew any thing of Geo<a id="l1005"></a>metry.</p>
