But the rest of the Churches of Christ <a id="l9"></a>disagreed from the Church of Rome in this point, contending that Christ <a id="l10"></a>had given no authority to Antichristians to baptize. There was but one God <a id="l11"></a>one Christ one  spirit one Church one faith &amp; one baptism   And This baptism was <a id="l13"></a>in the name of that God &amp; that Christ &amp; that Spirit &amp; into that faith &amp; by  it men were <a id="l14"></a>admitted into that Church.  Whereas Antichristians  denied that God &amp; that Christ <a id="l15"></a>&amp; had not that Spirit nor that faith &amp;   were enemies to that Church &amp;  by another <a id="l16"></a>baptism  into another faith admitted men into another Church. </p>
<p id="par2">The  education of learned men in the  principles of Plato &amp; other heathen philosophers  before they became Christians, <a id="l20"></a>the study of the heathen learning by some  learned men after they <a id="l21"></a>became Christians  &amp; the reception of Montanism by the bishop of Rome aboutthe end of the 2<sup>d</sup> century &amp; the easy admission of  hereticks into the latine Church <a id="l22"></a>all in the third century &amp; the writings of Tertullian &amp; some other learned men <a id="l23"></a>gave occasion to the spreading of some  erroneous opinions in the very early <a id="l24"></a>Church her self, &amp; particularly  to the spreading of the opinion the  <a id="l25"></a>son of God was the Λόγος ἐνδιάθετοσ  –– – – from the Sun. For Athenagoras <a id="l26"></a>in his Apology for the Christians, after he – – – – – – quæ est Patris et filij.</p>

<p id="par4">The education of learned men in the principles of  Plato  before they became Christians <a id="l35"></a> gave occasion to the  propagating of those <a id="l36"></a>opinions not only  amongst such as separated from the Church but even in the</p>

Then in another Council of Sirmium A.C. 359 in a <a id="l75"></a>Creed  in which they professed the son to be similis Patri secundum scripturas.  Which <a id="l76"></a>Creed was published  before the Emperor at Sirmium &amp; subscribed the same year by the Councils of Ariminum in Italy &amp; <a id="l77"></a> Nice in Thrace. And the same  year  the <a id="l78"></a>Council of Seleucia abolished the use of those words both in their  preface to the Creed of Lucius <a id="l79"></a>the martyr, &amp;  at the end of that Creed where they  confirm the  said faith of Sirmium <a id="l80"></a>. And the next year A.C. 360 the  Council of Constanti<a id="l81"></a>nople  subscribed  it without any material <a id="l82"></a>alteration of words. The reasons given for abolishing the use of those <a id="l83"></a>words were  because they were not extant in the scripture nor <a id="l84"></a> allowed by ancient Councils nor understood by the people. For by The Apostles  rule they were to hold fast the form of sound words.  The Council of <a id="l86"></a>Antioch convened against Paul of Samosat  60 years <a id="l87"></a>before the Council of Nice,  rejected the Sons being ὁμοούσιος to the father <a id="l88"></a>&amp; the sentence of this Council was communicated to &amp; approved by all <a id="l89"></a>the Churches of the Roman Empire &amp; therefore could not be revoked. The Council of Nice had admitted the word <a id="l90"></a>Ὁμοούσιος hastily &amp; without due deliberation  being pressed by the Emperor then present &amp; the word was misinterpreted &amp; thereby proved  a stumbling block to <a id="l91"></a>people leading them into the errors of Sabellius, Montanus &amp; the Gnosticks. For <a id="l92"></a> the Council  of Nice took the word in the same sense with ὁμοιούσιος, as appeared by <a id="l93"></a>the Acts of the Council produced at Ariminum, but the Latines translated it <a id="l94"></a>unius substantiæ &amp;  unius hypostasis &amp; the people were apt to understand this <a id="l95"></a>translation in the sense of those hereticks. Hilary in the third year of his banishment A.C. 358, writing to the bishops of Gaull &amp; Britain &amp; taking pains to make them understand in what sense the father &amp; son were to be called una substantia, speaks thus to them, Multi ex vobis fratres charissimi – – – –  – – – – – in some of those corrupt senses. And a little after he <a id="l97"></a>repeats the objection several times without denying the matter of fact <a id="l98"></a>Sed forte dicetur, saith he idcirco [homousion] improbari oportere qu<span class="gap" title="Text is missing due to a blot">{illeg}</span>itiose <a id="l99"></a>intelligentem?

Thus did the <a id="l108"></a>eastern Churches for putting a stop to the growth of Sabellianism, Montanism, &amp; Gnosticism &amp;c <a id="l109"></a>prevail with the western Churches to lay aside the ὁμοούσιος as the Council <a id="l110"></a>of Antioch with the approbation of the Church Catholick had done long before for putting a stop to the growth of the heresy <a id="l111"></a>of Paul of Samosat.  And now the eastern &amp; western Churches being <a id="l112"></a>reunited in outward profession of faith became once more the visible Church Catholick of the Roman Empire. <a id="l113"></a> I speak of the visible church whose communion is <a id="l116"></a>measured by outward profession of faith. For God  alone  is the searcher of hearts. <a id="l117"></a> If it be said that this Church was Arrian in outward profession of faith,  <a id="l119"></a>for rejecting the word ὁμοούσιος, I do not see how the Church catholic in the <a id="l120"></a>days of Paul of Samosat can be excused for  doing the like</p>
<p id="par9"> Hilary in his book de synodis written in Asia A.C. 358, tells the western <a id="l121"></a>Bishops, Tantum ecclesiarum Orientalium periculum est, ut ravum sit hujus <a id="l122"></a>fidei [sc. consubstantialis] quæ qualis sit vos judicate, aut sacerdotes aut populum <a id="l123"></a>inveniri – – – – – Nam absque Episcopo Eleusio et paucis cum eo, ex majori parte Asia<a id="l124"></a>næ decem Provinciæ intra quas consisto, vere Deum nesciunt. This state of things  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p117v"> &lt;117v&gt; </span> increased so much that  in the reign of Iovian which was about five years <a id="l125"></a>after </p>

<p id="par10">The faith which Athanasius &amp; his followers began now to  preach <a id="l126"></a>was the Serdican with this  alteration that instead of  calling the <a id="l127"></a>father son &amp; h.g.  one  usia &amp; one hypostasis they called them <a id="l128"></a>one usia &amp; three hypostases,  changing the language of one hypostasis <a id="l129"></a>into that of three hypostases for clearing themselves from the imputation of <a id="l130"></a>Sabellianism under whichthey had hitherto lain.  <a id="l133"></a>ffor by one usia &amp;  hypostasis, or as the Latines exprest it, una  substantia et tres personæ they meant one substance in na<a id="l135"></a>ture &amp; species &amp; three  substances in number   the <a id="l136"></a>word person being taken for an intelligent substance. This faith <a id="l137"></a>Athanasius Eusebius verc. &amp; 12 or 15 other Bishops returning from banishment  had agreed upon  at Alexandria a few months before abolishing the use of the words usia <a id="l139"></a>&amp; hypostasis except in opposition to Sabellianism.  But afterwards they retained una usia in <a id="l140"></a>conformity  to the una substantia of the Latines &amp;   distinguished the persons <a id="l141"></a>only by the name of hypostases.</p>

<p id="par11" class="i0">&amp; abolished the use of the word usia. The reasons they gave for abolishing it are <a id="l142"></a>thus set down by Hilary. De homœusio quod est similis essentiæ, commune iudicium est. De homousio vestro quod est unius substantiæ tractantes <a id="l143"></a>primum idcirco respuendum pronunciastis, quia  [per] verbi hujus enunciationem <a id="l144"></a>– – – – nusquam scriptum repenaretur./.  The meaning of the first of these reasons is that <a id="l145"></a>whereas the word ὀμοούσιος properly signifes  a substance  derived from another substance by  some sort of <a id="l147"></a>separation or distinction, &amp;  the Council of Nice  agreed that the word was not to be taken in such a sense, nor to signify <a id="l149"></a>any thing more then ὀμοιούσιος similis substantiæ &amp; yet the Latines  translated the word <a id="l150"></a>unius substantiæ &amp; thereby laid aside the interpretation  agreed <a id="l151"></a>upon by the Nicene Council, &amp; gave occasion to the  <a id="l152"></a>people to understand the Nicene decree in favour of the erros of Sabellius <a id="l153"></a>Montanus &amp; the Gnosticks; for puting a stop to these errors it was fit the <a id="l154"></a>word <em class="underline">usia</em> should be laid aside.  And that the word usia was  mis<a id="l155"></a>interpreted by the people  Hilary himself is witness. Multi ex nobis, fra<a id="l156"></a>tres charissimi – – – – – quam inter se duo pares habeant. Here Hilary describes <a id="l157"></a>three corrupt senses in which the people understood the Nicene decree, the first <a id="l158"></a>in favour of Sabellianism, the second in favour of Montanism &amp; the third in <a id="l159"></a>favour of the errors of Hieracas &amp; the Gnosticks, &amp; says that many of his <a id="l160"></a>party understood unam substantiam in some of these  corrupt senses  And for <a id="l162"></a> making it appear that the  ὀμοούσιος was not to <a id="l163"></a>be understood in any of these senses, the Acts of the Nicene Council were <a id="l164"></a>produced, in which the word was interpreted to signify nothing more then ὀμοιούσιος <a id="l165"></a>or ὁμιος κατ᾽ ὀυσίαν.</p>

<p id="par13">For understanding the force of the second reason it is to be considered that <a id="l166"></a>the sentence of the Council of Antioch  against Paul of Samosat, by which the <a id="l167"></a> Council rejected the ὀμοούσιος, communicated to &amp; approved by all the Chur<a id="l168"></a>ches of the Roman Empire without any dispute arising thereupon. And <a id="l169"></a> the Councils of Sirmium Nicæa Ariminum Seleucia &amp; Constantinople are not to be blamed for  restoring <a id="l170"></a> a decree which had been made by the Council of Antioch &amp; established by the <a id="l171"></a>consent of the Church Catholick above 90 years before, &amp; so had the tradition of the Church <a id="l172"></a>catholick on its side.</p>
<p id="par14">The third reason, namely that the ὀμοούσιος which the Nicene fathers had been <a id="l173"></a>compelled to admit, was not to be received because not in scripture, is <a id="l174"></a>made stronger by the Apostles command: <em class="underline">Hold fast the form of sound <a id="l175"></a>words</em>. A command which no  Council whatever had authority to repeal <a id="l176"></a>or trans</p>
<p id="par15">Vpon these reasons the Council of Sirmium</p>

The first or highest was the sphere called Kether the <a id="l223"></a>Crown  &amp; the highest crown because it encompassed the other nine. This sphere was much <a id="l224"></a>less then the sphere of splendor there being a vast empty space between <a id="l225"></a>them. And within this sphere were  the spheres of the other nine <a id="l226"></a>Sephiroths the lowest of which was Malcath the kingdom. These sephiroths they distinguished into two classes, called <a id="l227"></a>Arich Anpin &amp; Seir Anpin the man with a great face &amp; the man with a little face &amp; in Seir Anpin  comprehended the <a id="l228"></a>seven lower sephiroths &amp; put the names of these seven sephiroths <a id="l229"></a>to signify the seven metals. Whence  it seems to me that they  made the orbs of the seven Planets &amp; that this  <a id="l230"></a>Cabbalistical philosophy had it's rise from  Aristotles system of the <a id="l231"></a>world. He being the master of Alexander the great, his philosophy <a id="l232"></a>came into request  in the reign of the successors of Alexander <a id="l233"></a> especially in Egypt The three superior Sephiras comprehended in Arich Anpin, an<a id="l234"></a>swer to the Cœlum empyreum the primum mobile &amp; the firmamentum <a id="l235"></a>stellatum. And thus the ten sephirahs are nothing else then the <a id="l236"></a>intelligences which Aristotle &amp; his successors placed in the heavenly  Orbs  Aristotel made but eight Orbs  <a id="l238"></a>seven of the Planets &amp; one of the fixt stars &amp; thence came the ogdoas of <a id="l239"></a>Æons as I said above. Hyparchus &amp; Ptolomy added a ninth called the <a id="l240"></a>Primum mobile, &amp;  Theologers have added the cœlum empyreum &amp; reccon <a id="l241"></a>it the seat of the blessed. The Cabbalists also supposed that the souls of <a id="l242"></a>men come down from above &amp; passed into various bodies till they had performed <a id="l243"></a>all that they were to do And thus does the philosophy of the Cabbalists agree with <a id="l244"></a>that of the Gnosticks.</p>

Athanasius in his younger days poured water upon the hands of his master Antony  He was first a monck then a Deacon &amp; then a bishop &amp; finding the Moncks <a id="l306"></a>faithful to him made many of them bishops &amp; Presbyters in Egypt &amp; these <a id="l307"></a>bishops erected Monasteries in their cities, out of which they chose Presbyters &amp; <a id="l308"></a>sent bishops to other cities.

Veruntamen, O Tripho, <a id="l341"></a>non perierit illud, Christum hunc esse Dei, si demonstrare nequeam, <a id="l342"></a>et fuisse prius filium conditoris universitatis hujus Dei, esseque Deum, &amp; <a id="l343"></a>genitum esse hominem ex virgine;  Sed ex omni  ostenso [sequatur tantum] quod hic est Christus <a id="l346"></a>Dei, quicunque tandem sit.  Si non demonstravero, inquam, <a id="l347"></a>eum et prius extitisse et nasci hominem sustinuisse ijsdem nobiscum <a id="l348"></a>passionibus obnoxium, carnem habentem secundum Patris consilium <a id="l349"></a>&amp; voluntatem: in eo ipso tantum æquum fuerit me errore lapsum <a id="l350"></a>esse dicere, non autem negare hunc esse Christum illum,  si modo <a id="l351"></a>tanquam homo ex hominibus genitus,  esse appareat et electione Christus <a id="l352"></a>factus esse ostendatur. Sunt enim aliqui, O amici, ex genere <a id="l353"></a>nostro, profitentes  ipsum Christum esse, sed hominem <a id="l354"></a>tamen ex hominibus genitum affirmantes: quibus non assentior, <a id="l355"></a>neque id sane multi, qui in eadem mecum sententia sunt, dixerint <a id="l356"></a>Iustin. Dial. cum Tryphon p. 267</p>
<p id="par29">The Christians therefore who beleived that Christ was before <a id="l357"></a>the world began, were much the greater number  in the days <a id="l358"></a>of Iustin Martyr but did not yet looke upon the Christians of the other  opinion as hereticks <a id="l359"></a>Or  think the difference between the two <a id="l360"></a>opinions  material to the truth of the Christian religion.  <a id="l361"></a>And in this state things continued till the days of Victor. ffor <a id="l362"></a>Victor excommunicated one Theodotus a Tanner for affirming that Christ <a id="l363"></a>was a mere man born of the virgin Mary by the power of the holy <a id="l364"></a>Ghost, &amp; elected for his justice &amp; vertue. And henceforward those of this <a id="l365"></a>opinion were accounted hereticks &amp; Theodotus was accounted the first <a id="l366"></a>author of the heresy.  But those who beleived Christ to be but a mere man <a id="l367"></a>&amp;<sup>e</sup><sup class="note" id="n6-ref">[6]</sup> particularly the followers of Artemon) represented that this was the doctrine of the Christians till the times of Victor <a id="l368"></a>&amp; that from the times of his successor Zepherinus (in whose days  Arte<a id="l369"></a>mon was condemned  in the east for the like opinion) the truth was adulter<a id="l370"></a>ated.</p>
<p id="par30">Also the Church of Rome in the days of Pope Victor began to <a id="l371"></a>  place religion in ceremonies &amp; to err in the faith. ffor this Pope <a id="l372"></a>excommunicated the Churches of Asia for keeping Easter upon <a id="l373"></a>the 14<sup>th</sup> day of the first month of the Iewish year a thing in its own nature indifferent &amp; wrote <a id="l374"></a>communicatory letters to the  Churches of the Montanists <a id="l375"></a>in Asia &amp; Phrygia, &amp; then turned  Patripassian &amp; recalled those letters, <a id="l376"></a>as Tertullian a Montanist in his book against Praxeas written <a id="l377"></a>about the year 201 thus mentions. – – – – – – – crucifixit. The Predecessors <a id="l378"></a>of Victor who had opposed the Montanists were Soter &amp; Eleutherus. <a id="l379"></a>ffor Soter wrote against them at their first rise, &amp; Irenæus was sent to <a id="l380"></a>Rome by the church of Lyons to conferr with Eleutherus against <a id="l381"></a>them. And therefore Victor was the first Bishop of Rome who turned Montanist. He seems to have closed with the Montanists of Asia &amp; Phrygia in opposition to the true Church  he excommunicated.</p>
<p id="par31">The changes therefore wrought in the Church of Rome by Pope Victor <a id="l382"></a>in respect of the faith were so very great that we may begin the third state <a id="l383"></a>or age of the church with the Papacy of <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>S<sup>t</sup><span class="nb-n">}</span></span> Victor or reign of the Emperor <a id="l384"></a>Severus.</p>

<p id="par32">And this is to be understood as well of the Christians of the <a id="l385"></a>circumcision as of the Christians of the uncircumcision. ffor Iustin <a id="l386"></a>Martyr in his Dialogue with Tryphon written between the years <a id="l387"></a>140 &amp;  150, represents that Christian  Iews might keep the law <a id="l388"></a>&amp; circumcise their children but Christian Gentiles might not. His words are: Si ipsi [Iudæi] propter animi <a id="l389"></a>imbecilitatem, etiam quæcunque nunc possunt ex Mosæ constitutio<a id="l390"></a>nibus, quæ ob duritiam  cordis populi sancita esse intelligimus, unà <a id="l391"></a>cum concepta in hunc Christum spes atque perpetuis naturâque com<a id="l392"></a>paratis justitiæ et religionis veræ actionibus, servare, &amp; cum Christi<a id="l393"></a>anis fidelibusque vivere voluerint; ut modo illis non suadeant <a id="l394"></a>pariter cum eis circumcidi ac sabbata agere aliaque quæcunque tandem <a id="l395"></a>sunt ejusmodi, exequi: eos recipiendos &amp; ad communionem verum <a id="l396"></a>omnium ut fratres, eorundemque viscerum homines, admittendos esse <a id="l397"></a>censuerim. Sin qui generis vestri sunt, in hunc Christum se credere <a id="l398"></a>asseverantes, O Trypho,  omnibus modis secundum legem per <a id="l399"></a>Mosem latam eos vivere cogant qui ex gentibus in hunc Christum <a id="l400"></a>credunt; aut  cum illis qui sic instituuntur communicare recusant: consimiliter et hos non susceperim.

And this I account the state of the Church  catholic in point of the faith &amp; communion  of the churches till the  death of Iustin &amp; the days of Pope Eleutherus &amp; his successor <a id="l407"></a>Victor. For about that time  some Christians began to make additions to their <a id="l408"></a>creed mixing strong meats with the milk which was to be given to babes.  And particularly in opposition to the Gnosticks who denyed the <a id="l409"></a>resurrection of the body &amp; maintained that the souls of men after various <a id="l410"></a>transmigrations returned into God, some Latines began to add the resurrection of <a id="l411"></a>the body &amp; the life everlasting to the end of their Creed, &amp;  <a id="l412"></a>in opposition to the Ebionites some Greeks began to insert the creation of the <a id="l413"></a>world by Iesus Christ.  </p>

<p id="par34">For  in the first age of Christianity  there were Christians (especially among the Iews) who beleived that  <a id="l427"></a>Iesus took his beginning from the Virgin Mary, &amp; for his vertue was chosen before <a id="l428"></a>other men  &amp;  annointed king of the Iews by <a id="l429"></a>the Holy Ghost &amp; thence called the Messiah or Christ that is the annoin<a id="l430"></a>ted, &amp; there were other Christians (especially among the Gentiles) who beleived that Iesus was before the <a id="l431"></a>  world began &amp; that the world was created by him.

<p id="par37" class="i0">What the Ebionites meant by the first of these three opinions I do not well understand <a id="l448"></a>unless perhaps they meant that Christ was the Adam Kadmon or first Man of the Cabbalists, that is, their first <a id="l449"></a>Sephiroth or Æon called  by them <em class="underline">Cochmah</em> the Crown or  supreme  Sephiroth <a id="l450"></a>&amp; by the Gnosticks Αρχὴ the beginning or Principle. But be that as it will <a id="l451"></a>it is manifest that the Ebionites according to all the three opinions <a id="l452"></a>here ascribed to them taught that Christ was as old as the creation of the <a id="l453"></a>world, &amp; according to the second &amp; third opinion &amp; perhaps the 1<sup>st</sup> also that he was above the Angels &amp; the Archangels <a id="l454"></a>&amp; reigned over them, &amp; all things else from the beginning [ &amp;  so  by the Cabbalists must be taken for Adam Kadmon &amp; by all th <a id="l455"></a>not inferior either in time or dominion to the Adam Kadmon of the Cabba<a id="l456"></a>lists, or to the Angel of Gods presence in the scriptures.] And tho they  said that he was created yet  those of the second sort meant  surely not that he was  created out of nothing but <a id="l458"></a>rather that he was  the first begotten of every creature  the beginning <a id="l460"></a>   &amp; those of the third that he was not generated in the usual significati<a id="l472"></a>on of the word, that is, by emission of the fathers substance, as men are generated &amp; as the heathens supposed <a id="l473"></a>their Gods to be generated. The main difference between the Ebionites was  <a id="l474"></a> about the incarnation of this Christ some <a id="l475"></a>of them sa] &amp; came down from heaven &amp; was either incarnate <a id="l476"></a>of the virgin or descended upon Iesus. And whereas they said that he was created they meant  in the sense of the words then in use.</p>

<span class="pagenumber" id="p123v"> &lt;123v&gt; </span>
<p id="par38" class="i0">And if the Ebionites  made Christ as old as the creation &amp; took him to be the supreme being next under the <a id="l477"></a>father &amp; Lord of the Universe much more did the Nazarenes. ffor the Nazarenes generally  <a id="l478"></a>called Christ the son of God which those  Ebionites who said that Iesus was the <a id="l479"></a>son of Ioseph, did not. Those Ebionites saidonly that Iesus was the son of God <a id="l480"></a>by election &amp; by the descent of Christ upon him, but they allowed no ge<a id="l481"></a>neration of Christ as the Nazarenes did,  nor did they <a id="l482"></a>say  that Christ suffered on the cross &amp; rose again from the dead.  These things they attributed only to Iesus the son of Ioseph &amp; Mary <a id="l484"></a> but there<a id="l485"></a>fore the Nazarenes who said that Christ (meaning what we call the divine nature) was the son of God &amp; suffered <a id="l486"></a>&amp; rose again &amp; ascended, were of the opinion of those who beleived <a id="l487"></a>that Christ came down from heaven, took flesh of the Virgin by <a id="l488"></a>the power of God  &amp; was born of her &amp;   suffered &amp; rose again <a id="l489"></a>from the dead &amp; ascended where he was before, &amp; by reason of his <a id="l490"></a>supernatural incarnation was called the son of God.</p>
<p id="par39">Vpon the  Iewish war commencing, the Christian Iews fled <a id="l491"></a>from Ierusalem into other countries &amp; chiefly into Peræa on the eastern side of Iordan.  And there <a id="l492"></a>they acquired the name of Ebionites,  being called Ebionites  by them <a id="l493"></a>selves &amp; their freinds &amp; Nazarenes by their enemies the  unbeleiving Iews. ffor they gloried in the <a id="l494"></a>name of Ebionites &amp; said that they knew of no such man as Ebion, but <a id="l495"></a> from the times of the Apostles had  distributed  their goods  to the <a id="l496"></a>poor &amp;  by that means being generally  impoverished were called Ebionites <a id="l497"></a>from the  word Ebion which in their language signifies a poor man. <a id="l498"></a>And divers among them being so zealous of the law as not only to <a id="l499"></a>observe it themselves but also to impose it on the converted Gentiles  &amp; <a id="l500"></a> these zelots also falling into the opinion that Christ descended upon Iesus <a id="l501"></a>the son of Ioseph &amp; Mary, the name of Ebionites at length degenerated <a id="l502"></a>into the name of  this heresy  those only being called Ebionites who said that Iesus was the son of Ioseph &amp; Mary &amp; that Christ descended upon Iesus, that is the divine nature upon the humane. And from all this it is hence manifest that  the  Christi<a id="l504"></a>ans of the Church of Ierusalem whether Ebionites or others beleived from the beginning that Christ <a id="l505"></a>was from the time of the creation  a being superior to the Angels &amp; Archangels <a id="l506"></a>&amp; at length came down from heaven &amp; either was incarnate or descended <a id="l507"></a>upon Iesus.

And <a id="l562"></a>from this time forward, that is during the last six or seven years of  the <a id="l563"></a>reign of Valens there was a very sharp contention.</p>

<p id="par51">He was accused  by the Meletians of killing Arsenius,  one of their <a id="l564"></a>bishops &amp; of seueral other crimes &amp; condemned for them – – – – – – –  this Council wrote also to the Churches in defense of Athanasius <a id="l566"></a>&amp; in their Letter represent that Arsenius was alive &amp; desired to be <a id="l567"></a>joyned in communion with them, &amp; did not expect other testimony <a id="l568"></a> to prove that he was alive but he himself confessed  that he was alive by his letters which he wrote to our <a id="l570"></a>bishop Athanasius whom they affirmed to be his murderer. Nor <a id="l571"></a>were those wicked men ashamed to charge him with killing a man who was <a id="l572"></a> at so great a distance from us by land &amp; sea, &amp; whose place of <a id="l573"></a>abode at that time was known to no man. Yea they dared to <a id="l574"></a>hide him &amp; make him disappear when he had suffered nothing <a id="l575"></a>And if it could have been, they would have translated him into another <a id="l576"></a>world, or rather have killed him that they might have killed <a id="l577"></a>Athanasius  by objecting either a true or feigned murder. <a id="l578"></a>But herein thanks be to the divine providence which suffered nothing unjust <a id="l579"></a>to prevail, but produced Arsenius alive [vizt by his letters] before the eyes <a id="l580"></a>of all men &amp; manifestly  reproved their conspiracy <a id="l581"></a>&amp; calumny. For he does not avoid us as his murderers nor hates us <a id="l582"></a>as injurious to him. ffor he hath suffered no harm at all, but desires <a id="l583"></a>to join in communion with us, &amp; wishes to be amongst us,  as he hath written in his Letter. This was all that Athanasius <a id="l585"></a>&amp; 90 bishops of Egypt &amp; Libya had at that time to say  for  themselves. <a id="l586"></a>They knew nothing of the hand of Arsenius in a bag or of his <a id="l587"></a>appearing alive  before the Council of Tyre otherwise then by his Letter.  On the contrary they <a id="l588"></a>say that Arsenius  expected  no other testimonies of his being alive besides the Letter which he had sent to Athanasius  &amp; by which he <a id="l590"></a> exprest his desire to be amongst them.  This letter it seems <a id="l591"></a>was produced at the Council of Tyre to prove that Arsenius was <a id="l592"></a>alive &amp; the  Bishops of Egypt  in this Council of Alexandria insisted upon it as a sufficient <a id="l593"></a>proof of  his being alive &amp; of his ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 125v &gt; </span> ✝ desire to be amongst them: which is a demonstration that he was not yet amongst them &amp; that they had no <a id="l594"></a>better evidence of his being alive &amp; desiring to be amongst <a id="l595"></a>them then this Letter. The letter is extant in the apology of Athanasius against the Arians &amp; has an <a id="l596"></a>air of fiction. And if Arsenius had appeared alive before the Council of Tyre it is not to be imagined <a id="l597"></a>that the Council would have persisted in condeming them for the murder or that Athanasius would have fled from <a id="l598"></a>the Council or been banished by the Emperor Constantine. When Athanasius was first accused of killing Arsenius <a id="l599"></a>he made the Emperor beleive that Arsenius was alive. But Arsenius not appearing the Emperor  <a id="l600"></a>commanded that the cause should be heard before the Council of <span class="hspac-n" title="9 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Athanasius came not &amp; <a id="l601"></a> the Emperor the next year commanded that the cause should be heard before the Council of Tyre <a id="l602"></a>&amp; threatned Athanasius that if he would not goe thither he should  be carried by force. <a id="l603"></a>Athanasius then went with a great multitude of Egyptians. The Council heard the cause between him <a id="l604"></a>&amp; his accusers &amp; for their further satsfaction sent six of their number into Egypt to <a id="l605"></a>inform themselves upon the spot. Vpon the report of the six bishops Athanasius fled to the <a id="l606"></a>Emperor.

Of the same opinion were also some <a id="l628"></a>Christians of the uncircumcision called Alogi by Epiphanius. The Ebionites <a id="l629"></a>were such as the Apostle Paul reprehends for imposing the law upon <a id="l630"></a>the Gentiles. For they arose from the Christians of the circumcision who fled to Pella upon the sige of Ierusalem &amp; they were a branch of the Church of Ierusalem under Iames &amp;  communicated with the Churches of the circumcision (<span class="hspac-n" title="8 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <a id="l631"></a><span class="hspac-n" title="8 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>) but were schismaticks for refusing to communicate with Christians of <a id="l632"></a>the uncircumcision. The Nazarenes &amp; Alogi continued in communion with the <a id="l633"></a>Churches of the uncircumcision till about the end of the second century. For <a id="l634"></a>Iustin Martyr  in his dialogue against Tryphon  speaks to him <a id="l635"></a>in this manner,<sup class="note" id="n7-ref">[7]</sup> Verum enim vero, Trypho, dixi, non perierit illud Christum <a id="l636"></a>hunc esse Dei si demonstrare nequeam et fuisse prius filium conditoris <a id="l637"></a>universitatis esseque Deum et genitum esse hominem ex virgine: sed  ex omni demonstrat sequatum tantum quod hic sit Christus Dei quicunque tandem fuerit.

The Alogi therefore were not yet accounted hereticks. Epiphanius tells us that this heresy arose after that of the Cataphrygians, that is, they began then to be accounted hereticks. But I do not find that they were when Theodotus the currier of Byzantium was  condem<a id="l642"></a>ned by Pope Victor for holding Christ to be a mere man &amp; soon after I think in the days of Zepherin the successor of Victor Artemon the master <a id="l643"></a>of Theodotus was  condemned  by the Greeks for the <a id="l644"></a>same error,   their disciples alledged that their opinion was  taught by the Apostles &amp; first Christians &amp; the truth of the doctrine <a id="l646"></a>preached was conserved to the days of pope Victor, but from the days of his successor <a id="l647"></a>Zepherin was adulterated. Yet I do not find that  Artemon &amp; Theodotus <a id="l648"></a>were of the same opinion with the Ebionites &amp; Alogi. The  last rejected <a id="l649"></a>the λόγος &amp; the writings of Iohn, the former  (so far as I can find) owned <a id="l650"></a>both.  ffor Epiphanius <a id="l651"></a>argues against  Theodotus out of the writings of Iohn concerning the λόγος. If this Theodotus <a id="l652"></a>was the same with Theodotus the Cataphrygian, &amp; Artemon was Artemas the master of Paul of Samosat, they might be of the same opinion <a id="l653"></a>with Paul  Marcellus &amp; Photinus. For Theodotus &amp; Artemas or Artemon <a id="l654"></a>&amp; Paul &amp; Marcellus &amp; Photinus are all of them equally accused of making Christ a <a id="l655"></a>mere man. By which opinion I conceive they meant that Iesus was a mere man <a id="l656"></a>inhabited by the λόγος as a Prophet is  by the holy Ghost.</p>

Whence  I gather that they received the <a id="l741"></a>Aristotelick systeme of the heavens, &amp; that their Sephiroths were originally the <a id="l742"></a>supreme intelligences which Aristotel placed in the spheres to move them,  &amp; the <a id="l743"></a>world Briah was the system of Intelligences under them &amp; the world Iezirah the system of <a id="l744"></a>Angels under them. ffor they distinguisehd the sephiroths into two classes which they called <a id="l745"></a> Arich Anpin &amp; Seir Anpin, the man with a great face &amp; the man with a little face <a id="l746"></a>&amp;  in Seir Anpin comprehended the seven lower sephiroths &amp; called the <a id="l747"></a>seven metals by the names of these seven Sephiroths.

And hence came the philosophy of the Gnosticks <a id="l751"></a>who placed an Ogdoas of Æons in the orbs of the seven Planets &amp; the heaven above them or the starry firma<a id="l752"></a>ment. By Arich Anpin they understood the first Sephiroth  called Kether <a id="l753"></a>the crown because the starry firmament was the highest Orb  &amp; encompassed the system <a id="l754"></a>of the Planets. Aristotle made only these eight heavens supposing the starry firmament <a id="l755"></a>to be the first mover but later Astronomers  have distinguished this heaven into  more orbs then one placing the first mover above the starry firma<a id="l757"></a>ment &amp; the cœlum crystallinum between them &amp;  accordingly some refer the <a id="l758"></a>second &amp; third Sephiroths to Arich Anpin.

For as the Gnosticks placed their Æons in the Orbs of the stars &amp; Planets <a id="l761"></a>so did the Cabbalists their Sephiroths,  following therein the doctrine of Aristo<a id="l762"></a>tel who placed Intelligences in the  Planetary Orbs to move them.

This Man they also call Nous. <a id="l847"></a>But  <a id="l849"></a>whereas the Gnosticks made Nous the son of  Ennœa Irenæus <a id="l850"></a>tells them that they should rather have made Ennœa the daugh<a id="l851"></a>ter of Nous because Nous the Mind is the fountain of thinking &amp; Ennoia thinking is the <a id="l852"></a>motion. The first motion of Nous the Mind is Ennoia &amp; if it persevere &amp; encreas <a id="l853"></a>it is called Euthymosis, &amp; after much  perseverance &amp; becoming perfect it is <a id="l854"></a>called perception, &amp; at length it becomes Council &amp; Council by persevering with <a id="l855"></a> motion is deliberation &amp; deliberation at length becomes λόγος ἐνδιάθετος reason <a id="l856"></a>&amp; from reason is emitted λογος προφορικὸς a word or speech. And all <a id="l857"></a>these things are but one thing in several degrees, &amp; have place only in the <a id="l858"></a>Mind of man. They err therefore saith Irenæus in ascribing to God the affections <a id="l859"></a>&amp; passions of man &amp; making him a compound. ffor God is not as man nor are his thoughts like ours. He is <a id="l860"></a>simple &amp; not compound. He is all like &amp; equal to himself all sense all spirit all <a id="l861"></a>perception all Ennœa all λόγος all  ear, all eye all light. He is all <a id="l862"></a>sense which cannot be separated from it self, nor is there any thing in him which can <a id="l863"></a>be emitted from any thing else. Thus does Irenæus represent &amp; confute the Metaphysicks of the Gnos<a id="l864"></a>ticks. And whereas  after the Apostle Iohn had said In the beginning was 
<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p128v"> &lt;128v&gt; </span> Word &amp; the Word was with God, the Gnosticks called the <em class="underline">beginning</em> Nous &amp; <a id="l865"></a><em class="underline">the ffather</em> Proarche, &amp; took the <em class="underline">Word</em> for the λογος ενδιαθετος  ἢ προφορικὸς &amp; feigned that <em class="underline">silence</em> preceded the Word &amp; thence <a id="l867"></a>called Ennœa by the name of Sige: Irenæus  tells the Gnosticks <a id="l868"></a>that Logos &amp; Sige could not be in Bythos at one &amp; the same time <a id="l869"></a>no more then light &amp; darkness. And if they say that  this <a id="l870"></a>λόγος was ἐνδιάθετος (for it seems this was the language of these <a id="l871"></a>Gnosticks) then  Σιγὴ will be also ἐνδιάθετος: which two saith he <a id="l872"></a>are inconsistent,  &amp; therefore Σιγὴ is not <a id="l873"></a>ἐνδιάθετος.

And whereas Iohn had said in the beginning of his Gospel Ἐν ἀρχη ἠν ὁ <a id="l933"></a> <a id="l934"></a>λόγος <em class="underline">In the beginning was the Word</em>, they said that ἡ ἀρχὴ the beginning was Nous  &amp; <a id="l935"></a>in  this Νους was the λόγος &amp; thence concluded that Nous &amp; Logos were the two first Æons <a id="l936"></a>[Iren. l 1. c. 1. sect 18.] The λογος answers to the second sephiroth called Cochma reason or wisdom &amp; φρόνησις Prudence the third Æon of Basilides is the third sephiroth of the Cabbalists And the Ennœa of Simon &amp; Menander they retained &amp; <a id="l937"></a>made her the wife of Bythos &amp; called her <em class="underline">Sige</em> silence because  silence preceded <a id="l938"></a> Logos called Binah Prudence, &amp; <em class="underline">Charis</em> favour because by her favour the treasures of By<a id="l939"></a>thos were  effused into the Æons.  ffor that this was their philosophy <a id="l940"></a>is described by Irenæus in the beginning of his first book &amp; by the Valentini<a id="l941"></a>ans themselves in one of their letters cited by Epiphanius in these words. In the <a id="l942"></a>beginning, say they, he who of himself is the father – – –– – – likeness of Sige. <a id="l943"></a>This Man they also called the father &amp; Nous  &amp; said that Bythos was unknown to all the Æons except Nous &amp; these four  Bythos &amp; Sige  Nous &amp; Alethea <a id="l946"></a>they called the Tetractys of Pythagoras &amp; said that Nous &amp; Alethea  <a id="l947"></a>emitted Logus &amp; Zoe.  &amp;  Ptolomæus assigned to the unknown father two <a id="l949"></a>wives Ennœa &amp; Thelesis Vnderstanding &amp; will, &amp; called them the affections <a id="l950"></a>of the unknown ffather &amp; said that the Vnderstanding was the older wife <a id="l951"></a>because the understanding precedes the Will.

And whereas the Gnosticks <a id="l955"></a>made  Nous the son of Ennœa Irenæus tells them – – – – – – – <a id="l956"></a>is not ἔνδιάθετος. [Iren. l. 2. c. 14, 15, 16, 47, 48, 49.] // The doctrine therefore <a id="l957"></a>that  the λόγος  or Word of God was the λογος ἐνδίάθετος of the <a id="l958"></a>father &amp; was emitted or exerted &amp; thereby generated  into a son <a id="l959"></a>before the world began came originally from the Gnosticks Basilides <a id="l960"></a> Valentinus, <sup>e</sup> Secundus? Ptolomæus, f<sup class="note" id="n11-ref">[11]</sup> Marcus <sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n12-ref">[12]</sup> Heracleon, &amp; perhaps also from <a id="l961"></a>Saturninus the fellow disciple of Basilides. ffor Irenæus  tells us that <a id="l962"></a>Valentinus had his opinions <sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n13-ref">[13]</sup> from his masters &amp; blames Saturninus Basili<a id="l963"></a>des Valentinus &amp; Marcion  &amp; the Gnosticks in general [Iren l. 2. c. <a id="l964"></a>18, 48, 49 ]  for pretending to know the generation of the Word <a id="l965"></a>&amp; explaining it by comparing to a Word spoken by a Man. 
And this opini<a id="l966"></a>on seems to have been as old as the days of Simon magus. For <sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n14-ref">[14]</sup> Eusebius tells <a id="l967"></a>us that Marcellus in making Quiet to precede the Logus imitated that impious  ringleader of the hereticks <a id="l968"></a>who  said atheistically:  <a id="l969"></a>ἠν Θεὸς καὶ Σιγή <em class="underline">There was God &amp; Silence</em>. And Gregory Nazianzen alluding <a id="l970"></a>to this doctrine of Simon &amp; his followers saith that the Simons &amp; the Marcions &amp; the <a id="l971"></a> Valentines &amp; theBasilides's &amp; Cerdons &amp; Cerinthuses &amp; Carpocrateses &amp;  all <a id="l972"></a>their trifles &amp;  juggling tricks were delivered τω ἑατων βυθω καὶ τη σὶγη <a id="l973"></a>to their  own abyss &amp; silence. . Whence <a id="l978"></a>it seems that after the writing of the Apocalyps &amp; Epistle to the Hebrews <a id="l979"></a>in which Christ is called  ο῾ λόγος του θεου, the Gnosticks began to compare him <a id="l980"></a>to  the λόγος of a man, which is first  silently conceived in the mind  &amp; then emitted with a voice after silence  to make him the son of God &amp; Silence. <a id="l983"></a>&amp; after the writing of the Gospel, to make him the son of Αρχὴ &amp; Αρχὴ <a id="l984"></a>the son of God &amp; Silence. ffor I think  it will easily be granted that  Ennoia had the name <a id="l985"></a>of silence not from her son Αρχὴ but from her son λόγος. And therefore <a id="l986"></a>the opinion that λόγος was the son of Sige was older then the  Heresy <a id="l987"></a>of Basilides &amp; must be attributed to the disciples of Simon of which Menander was <a id="l988"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> chief.</p>

[And the Phibionites a sect of these <a id="l993"></a>Nicolaitan Gnosticks, placed 365 Princes in so many cœlestial orbs giving names <a id="l994"></a>to each of them.] In the first  Orb they placed Iao, in the second <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Saclan<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the God of <a id="l995"></a>lust, in the third Seth, in the fourth Daden, in the fifth Abonæus, in the sixt  Philæus <a id="l996"></a>in the seventh  Ialdabaoth or Sabaoth the maker of heaven &amp; earth, ,  the God of the Iews, in the eighth &amp; highest orb they placed <a id="l999"></a>Barbelo &amp; the God of the universe &amp; another Christ was begotten of himself &amp; Christ who descended &amp; revealed  this knowledge to mankind, who was also called Iesus &amp; was mani<a id="l1001"></a>fested by Mary but not born of her nor took flesh otherwise then in ap<a id="l1002"></a>pearance.  And   these eight Orbs with their intelligences seems to have given occasion to <a id="l1003"></a>the Ogdoas of the Gnosticks. ffor Valentinus suited his Ogdoas to seven Orbs placing the uknown father above them. And further the Phibionites a sect of the  Nico<a id="l1004"></a>latians, multiplied the Orbs to the number of days in the year &amp;  in <a id="l1005"></a>these 365 orbs placed  so many Princes or Æons giving to each of them his proper <a id="l1006"></a>name.  Which  placing the AEons in  the celestial Orbs &amp;  increasing <a id="l1007"></a>the number of Orbs from eight to 365 &amp; giving a phantastic body to Iesus makes it evident that the Nicolaitans <a id="l1008"></a> were Gnosticks of the same kind  <a id="l1009"></a>with the followers of Basilides &amp; Valentinus  <a id="l1011"></a>but being of  Iudea gave hebrew names to their Æons, &amp; countenanced <a id="l1012"></a>their unclean actions by the copulation &amp; generation of their Æons.

<p id="par91"> For  some among the Greeks  took the Son to be an emanation or emission from  the ffather as light is  from the sun <a id="l1058"></a> or a river from the fountain &amp; on that account said that he was ομοούσιος to the father (of which sort were the Gnosticks Cata<a id="l1059"></a>phrygians or Montanists) others took him to be an attribute of the fathers substance <a id="l1060"></a>namely the fathers wisdom reason &amp; word spoken without which the ffather would be ἄσοφος &amp; ἄλογος <a id="l1061"></a> (of which sort were the Montanists &amp; Sabellians:) And all these embracing  the latin <a id="l1063"></a>translation of the Nicene Creed affirmed  that the ffather &amp; Son were μιας ύσιάς &amp; μιας <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p130v"> &lt;130v&gt; </span> υποστάσεος of one essence or substance &amp; one hypostasis,  &amp;  represented the denyal <a id="l1064"></a>of this to bee a denyal of the Nicene faith &amp; the maintaining of three  hypostases to be the introducing of a plurality of Gods. And those who with the Council of Nice held the son to be of like substance with the father looked upon those who held him to be of one hypostasis with the father to speak impiously as if they asserted the son to be without proper subsistence &amp; were of the same opinions with Montanus &amp; Sabellius. For Montanus made the Son a part of the fathers substance &amp; by consequence without  any other substance then that of the father. And hence arose great disputing <a id="l1065"></a>in private among the Greeks in the reign of Constantine the great &amp; in <a id="l1066"></a>the beginning of that of Constantius &amp; great criticising upon the word ομο<a id="l1067"></a>ουσιος. And those who took ὁμοούσιος for one substance were thought by those <a id="l1068"></a>of the other opinion to speak impiously as if they asserted the Son to be <a id="l1069"></a>without  proper subsistence &amp; were of the same opinions with Montanus &amp; <a id="l1070"></a>Sabellius  During these disputes, Eustathius bishop of Antioch  was accused  by Eusebius Pamphili  &amp; deposed as a Sabellian.  And those who took them for like substances were looked upon by the <a id="l1071"></a>other party as Gentiles introducing a plurality of Gods (Socr. l. 1. c. 23 &amp; <a id="l1072"></a>Sozom  l. 2. c. 18.] And when Eusebius of Nicomedia who opposed the language <a id="l1073"></a>of one substance was accused as if he opposed the ὁμοούσιος &amp; taxed for it by the Emperor Constantine the great he shewed the <a id="l1074"></a>Emperor  his garment &amp; answered boldly: If this garment <a id="l1075"></a>should be divided before my eyes yet I would never say that the two parts <a id="l1076"></a>were της ἀυτης ὀυσίας of the same substance. Sozom. l. 2. c. 21. By <a id="l1077"></a>this  answer Eusebius seemsto have satisfied the Emperor who knew <a id="l1078"></a>that the Council of Nice had approved the language of like substance: <a id="l1079"></a> for the Emperor afterwards had him in great honour &amp; was <a id="l1080"></a>baptized by him &amp; trusted him with his last will &amp; Testament  &amp; banished Eustathius for the other opinion &amp; consented that Arius upon retracting his novel expressions &amp; confining himself to the faith &amp; language of the Church should be received into communion. I cannot find that the Emperor or his son Constantius receded from the Nicene faith, but rather that they adhered to it constantly in the sense of the Council <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 130v &gt; </span> which was that ομοουσιος signified  not unius substantiæ but ομοιος κατ᾽ ουσίαν.</p>

<p id="par102" class="i0">Montanus refining the  errors of the Gnosticks made the Son &amp; <a id="l1129"></a>h. Ghost emissions from the ffather &amp; subordinate to him.

<p id="par103">Tertullian  a Montanist represents that God had reason <a id="l1139"></a>&amp; wisdom in himself by which he contrived all things before he created them, but <a id="l1140"></a> <a id="l1141"></a>as a mans reason &amp; ideas are  only internal in a man, before he declares them outwardly <a id="l1142"></a>by speaking so Gods reason or wisdom &amp; his conceptions or notions of all things <a id="l1143"></a>were only internal in God untill he began to speak  &amp; make them <a id="l1144"></a>appear outwardly in their species &amp; substances.

<p id="par105">By the mystery of iniquity he means the heresies which began to spring up in his days &amp; were to work till they ended in the  great apostacy  or Man of Sin. And Those heresies consisted principally in certain heathen opinions &amp; superstitions <a id="l1155"></a>&amp; impieties which men converted from the heathen religion endeavoured under various disguises &amp; specious pretenses to bring into <a id="l1156"></a>the Christian.  The chief of those opinions <a id="l1157"></a>was that all things came from one first being by emanation or emission of substance <a id="l1158"></a>&amp; returned into it ,  ffor  this was the opinion of the ancient Egyptians  <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Phenicians<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; Greeks &amp; the opinion of the Indian Brachmans to this day, &amp; of this opinion were Simon <a id="l1162"></a>Magus &amp; his  successors the Gnosticks. Simon &amp; Menander  called the <a id="l1163"></a>first emitted substance Ennoia &amp; the next Angels  &amp; said that Angels created the world.  Basilides called the first emission  Νους &amp; said that Νους was Christ &amp; <a id="l1165"></a>from Νους  derived  a series of other emissions the  last of which were Angels,  <a id="l1166"></a>&amp; the world  created by them. Nicolaus Valentinus, Secundus Marcus Heracleon Ophitæ &amp; Tatian called such emissions <a id="l1167"></a>Æons &amp; Irenæus tells us that  this doctrine of Æons came from Hesiods Gene<a id="l1168"></a>alogies of the  heathen Gods. With Hesiods genealogies may be joyned the Phœnician in Sanchomiato, the Egyptian in Manetho &amp; the <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> in the fragment of Byrsus Montanus made the Son &amp; Holy Ghost emissions from <a id="l1169"></a>the father &amp; subordinate to him &amp; Tertullian a Montanist called them consub<a id="l1170"></a>stantial &amp;  said that the son was a part of the father father was the whole substance &amp; the son an emanation of  a  derivation &amp; <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>property<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> of the  father &amp; part of him, &amp; I mistake if <a id="l1171"></a>Paul of Samosat did not call the Father &amp; Son consubstantial  in the  sense <a id="l1172"></a>of the Gnosticks. These Hereticks also taught the  heathen transmigration of souls &amp; derived the souls of men from the supreme  God by <a id="l1173"></a>emission reputing them parts of his substance &amp; making every soul to have various bodies denyed the resurrection of the body. For Simon Magus  said that the first <a id="l1174"></a>emission called Ennoia was shut up in a woman by Angels &amp; passed from woman to woman &amp; was in Minerva &amp; afterwards in Helen in the time of Trojan war .   &amp; that the Angels  passed into humane bodies that they might enjoy her  Saturninus or Saturnilis taught that when the Angels who made the world <a id="l1176"></a>had formed a man they were not able to give him life, but the virtue from above <a id="l1177"></a>emitted a spark of life which made the man live, &amp; which after death should return <a id="l1178"></a>to those things which are of the same nature  with it self.  Carpocrates &amp; Marcion held the transmigration of souls The <a id="l1179"></a>Montanists said that Man was not only made by a rational author but animated <a id="l1180"></a><sup>a</sup><sup class="note" id="n15-ref">[15]</sup> ex substantia ejus And The Manichees Priscilianists &amp; Stoicks (as Ierome tells us) <a id="l1181"></a>that the souls of men were particles of the substance of God. And in the same <a id="l1182"></a>sense I understand Epiphanius where he tells us that Valentinus &amp; Colarbasus <a id="l1183"></a>&amp; all the Gnosticks &amp; Manichees make certain traductions of souls &amp; trans<a id="l1184"></a>migrations into various bodies Hæres. 42.

<p id="par106"> Some hereticks  took away the substance of the son &amp; <a id="l1186"></a>holy Ghost  making them &amp; the ffather one &amp; the same substance in several respects; as  Simon Magus who  said that he  was that substance &amp; appeared <a id="l1188"></a>as the ffather in  Samaria, as the Son in  Iudæa &amp; as the holy Ghost in other <a id="l1189"></a>countries;  viz<sup>t</sup> in respect of several  bodies animated by the Deity according to the doctrine of the <a id="l1190"></a>transmigration of souls: And  Praxeas  Sabellius <a id="l1191"></a> &amp; such as others as gave the name of ffather Son &amp; holy Ghost to one &amp; the same <a id="l1192"></a>substance in respect of several attributes qualities,  dispositions or actions. But some  to avoid the name of Sabellians said that the attributes of God were substances.</p>
<p id="par107">Some hereticks as Saturninus Marcion Tatian &amp; the Encratites condemned <a id="l1193"></a>marriage &amp; the eating of the flesh of Animals &amp; Montanus <a id="l1194"></a> taught to abstein from marriage &amp; from some sorts <a id="l1195"></a>of meat.

<p id="par108">And some heresies spread so much that in the end of the second Century <a id="l1197"></a>or beginning of the third, the Bishop of Rome himself became first a Montanist <a id="l1198"></a>&amp; then a Praxean. Tertull. adv. Praxeam.</p>

And as Peter was the first <a id="l1339"></a>of the Apostles so the church of Rome was the first of the Churches &amp; to her <a id="l1340"></a>all the greater ecclesiastical causes &amp; judgments of bishops ought to be referred <a id="l1341"></a>&amp; nothing be determined without the Bishop of Rome. And this letter of the <a id="l1342"></a>Bishop of Rome to the Oriental Bishops was the first attempt to the univer<a id="l1343"></a>sal Bishopric, &amp; the beginning of Popery.

<p id="par166">From this opinion of the Egyptians Plato had his doctrine of Ideas &amp; the  <a id="l1613"></a>Iews, who in the  reign of the Greeks  were numerous in Egypt, had  theirs of the ten Sephiroths or splendors which were a<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ether<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>eal <a id="l1615"></a>emanations from the supreme deity.</p>


<p id="par169">  <a id="l1618"></a> From this opinion  came the metaphysical philosophy of the heathens about the origin of the world <a id="l1619"></a> the generation &amp; nature of the Gods &amp; the transmigration of Souls. And this doctrine of Dæmons was as old as  the <a id="l1620"></a>Idolatry of the heathens. ffor their Idolatry was grownded upon it. <a id="l1621"></a>And therefore Moses to prevent the spreading of this sort of Philosophy among <a id="l1622"></a>the Israelites wrote the history of the creation of the world in a very different <a id="l1623"></a>manner from the  Cosmogenias of the heathens, attributing the production of all <a id="l1624"></a>things to the immediate will  of the supreme God. Yet the  Israelites by conversing with the heathens  frequently lapsed into the worship of their <a id="l1627"></a>Gods &amp; by consequence received their Theology untill they were captivated <a id="l1628"></a>for these transgressions.  And afterwards by conversing with the  Chaldæans <a id="l1629"></a>   Egyptians &amp; Greeks they imbibed their  Metaphysical Theology as is manifest by the Cabbala of the Iews which <a id="l1631"></a>consists chiefly in describing how the first Being  whom they call Æn-Soph the infinite emitted ten gradual subordinate emanations which they call Sephiroths or Splendors,  the first <a id="l1633"></a> <a id="l1634"></a>immediately from  himself , the second  from the first, the third  <a id="l1636"></a>from the first or second  &amp; so on.  And these  ten emanations they  name after <a id="l1638"></a>Gods attributes &amp; powers,  calling the first  Kether the Crown  <a id="l1639"></a>, the second Cochmah wisdom, the third Binah <a id="l1640"></a>Prudence  the fourth Gedulah magnificence, the fift Geburah strength the sixt Tipherah beauty <a id="l1641"></a>&amp;  the last Melcoth the <span class="gap" title="Illegible hand (Extent: 1 word)">{illeg}</span>. And after these ten which they call mundus azilutheus the emanative world they make three lower worlds  which they call  Briah the throne of glory &amp; world of separate intelligences, Iezirah the world of <a id="l1644"></a> Angels &amp; Asiah the corporeal world that is the world in which we live. And they say that the influence <a id="l1645"></a>&amp; power of the first cause which they call Æn-Soph &amp; the Ænsophic world reaches <a id="l1646"></a>through all things &amp;  that of Kether  &amp; Cochmah &amp; Binah through all things below them &amp; that by means of the  superior powers the Azaluthic kingdom formed the world Briah, the Briathic kingdom <a id="l1648"></a>formed the world Iezirah &amp; the Iezirathic kingdom formed the lowest world <a id="l1649"></a>Asiah: &amp; that the souls of men come from above revolve &amp; pass into several  bodies &amp; after death return to the internal light of the <a id="l1650"></a>Shekinah.</p>

<p id="par170">This opinion seems to have had its rise from the  worshipping &amp; deifying of <a id="l1651"></a>dead kings &amp; exalting them in the opinion of the people till they made them the <a id="l1652"></a>highest celestiall Gods  &amp; took the oldest for the supreme God  or for a God <a id="l1653"></a>descended immediately from him &amp; his successors for a series of Gods <a id="l1654"></a>descended  successively from the oldest,  &amp; making this race of Gods as <a id="l1655"></a>ancient as the   world . For the Chaldeans placed a race of <a id="l1656"></a>ten successive Gods  reigning from the  beginning of the world to the time of the <a id="l1657"></a>flood,  as is recited in a fragment of Berosus preserved by Eusebius. The  <a id="l1658"></a>Egyptians  represented God's creation of the world by a spiders <a id="l1659"></a>weaving a webb out of her own bowels &amp; began their history with a <a id="l1660"></a> race of Gods &amp;  heroes the last of which was Orus. The Pheni<a id="l1661"></a>cians began their history with  the creation of the world &amp; a race of above <a id="l1662"></a>ten successive pairs of Gods as is recited by Sanchoniatho. And from Egypt <a id="l1663"></a>&amp; Phenicia came the like Theology into Greece as you may see in Hesiods Theoge<a id="l1664"></a>nia. And as the  Iews by conversing with the heathens fell into Idolatry frequently before the captivity so by conversing with the Chaldæans <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p137v"> &lt;137v&gt; </span> in the time of the Babylonian Captivity they seem to <a id="l1665"></a>have learnt the Theology of those nations &amp; refined it. ffor they <a id="l1666"></a>derived their mystical Cabbala by tradition from the days of Ezra &amp; supposed that it came to Ezra from Moses &amp; this Kabbala <a id="l1667"></a>consists chiefly in describing how  the first cause whom they call <a id="l1668"></a>Æn-Soph the infinite  emitted  gradually ten subordinate emanations <a id="l1669"></a>which they call Sephiroths – – – – –  formed the lowest world Asiah <a id="l1670"></a>X Each of the ten Sephiroths &amp;<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from lower down f 137v &gt; </span> X Each of the ten Sephiroths they called Adam a man &amp; the first of them they called <a id="l1671"></a>Adam Kadmon the first man &amp; make him the son of God as Adam is called in Scripture .  Which confirms the opinion that the ten <a id="l1672"></a>Sephiroths were originally ten men deified, namely the ten antidiluvian patriarchs <a id="l1673"></a>mentioned by Manetho the first of which was called Alorus  by the Chaldæans &amp; Adam by the Iews.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from higher up f 137v resumes &gt; </span> And as the ancient heathens held the transmigration of souls into various <a id="l1674"></a>bodies, making them come from  God &amp;  after various states return upwards from whence they came so  the caba<a id="l1676"></a>listical Iews held that souls had a revolution; coming from above <a id="l1677"></a>passing into various bodies &amp; after death returning to the internal <a id="l1678"></a>light of the Shekinah.</p>

<p id="par174">Now as the  Metaphysicks of the Cabbalistical Iews  came <a id="l1727"></a>from the Theology of the heathens, so the metaphysical opinions of the ancient hereticks <a id="l1728"></a> came from them  both.

<p id="par175">The hereticks of the circumcision as Simon  Nicolaus Cerinthus Menander would be <a id="l1730"></a>most apt to derive their opinions from the Iewish Cabbala &amp;  this  was the rise of the Gnosticks.

<p id="par178">For understanding the progress of these heresies it may be convenient to <a id="l1779"></a>distinguish  it into periods of time. And the first period I reccon the age of <a id="l1780"></a>the Apostles which ended with the death of Iohn in the first or 2<sup>d</sup> year of <a id="l1781"></a>Trajan, A.C. 99, or 100 or about seven years after with the death of Symeon the son of Cleopas &amp; bishop of <a id="l1782"></a>Ierusalem, the last of the Apostolic men who had seen Christ. For Hegesippus <a id="l1783"></a>who was contemporary to Irenæus mentioning the death of Symeon, adds that the <a id="l1784"></a>church continued till that time like a Virgin incorrupt &amp; pure; but after the holy company <a id="l1785"></a>of Apostles were dead, errors &amp; heresies began to spring up very fast.  <a id="l1786"></a>In this first age there were some hereticks of note as Simon, Menander, Nicolaus <a id="l1787"></a>&amp; Cerinthus, but these being checkt by the authority of Apostolick men who <a id="l1788"></a>had conversed with Christ, made no great progress.</p>
<p id="par179">In The next age   arose many hereticks Basilides, Carpocrates, Saturninus, Valentinus, Secundus, Ptolomæus Cerdon <a id="l1789"></a>Marcion, Apelles, Severus, Marcus, Colarbasus, Montanus, Tatian, Theodotion, Bardasanes, Noetus, <a id="l1790"></a>&amp; others, &amp; their  errors spread till they began to shock the Church <a id="l1791"></a>which  first happened in the  reign of <a id="l1792"></a>Severus, when  the Bishop of Rome turned first a Montanist &amp; then <a id="l1793"></a>a Praxean (as Tertullian mentions) &amp; excommunicated the Churches of <a id="l1794"></a>Asia for keeping Easter on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of the Moon. The third  age therefore must begin with the reign of Severus or Episcoppacy of Victor.</p>
<p id="par180">The  next period of moment  in respect of ecclesiastical affairs was the sharp per<a id="l1795"></a>secution of Decius in the end of which anniversary holy days to martyrs <a id="l1796"></a>were instituted &amp; auricular confession &amp; pennance crept into the churches &amp; Stephen <a id="l1797"></a>Bishop of Rome  excommunicated the Churches of Afric  <a id="l1798"></a>for not admitting the baptism of all sorts of hereticks.  &amp; by admitting <a id="l1800"></a>it himself he invited all hereticks to croud into his church.</p>

<h2 id="hd5" class="cent">Chap. <a id="l1808"></a><br>Of the working of the mystery of Iniquity</h2>
<p id="par184">The Apostle Paul hath told us that before the  day of Christ there <a id="l1809"></a>should be a falling away or an Apostasy &amp; the Man of Sin should be revealed the son of per<a id="l1810"></a>dition,  who opposeth &amp; exalteth himself above all that is called God or <a id="l1811"></a>that worshipped,  so that he as a <a id="l1812"></a>God  sitteth in the Temple  of God (as it were upon the throne between the Cherubims) shewing himself that he is a God, &amp; that this mystery <a id="l1813"></a>of iniquity worked even  in his days only that which letted should let untill it  <a id="l1814"></a>should be taken out of the way &amp; then should that wicked one be revealed whose <a id="l1815"></a>coming is after the working of Satan with all power &amp; signes &amp; lying wonders &amp; a <a id="l1816"></a>strong delusion &amp; with all deceivableness of unrighteousness &amp; who should reign <a id="l1817"></a>as a God or Oracle in the temple or Church of God untill the Lord should destroy <a id="l1818"></a>him with the brightness of his coming. There was to be therefore an Apostasy <a id="l1819"></a>which should last from the Apostles days to the  second <a id="l1820"></a>coming of Christ &amp; therefore is now in being. It worked in the <a id="l1821"></a>Apostles days &amp; was to work without dominion untill that which letted its rise <a id="l1822"></a>should be taken out of the way &amp; then it was to rise up   like an angel of light with all power &amp; signs <a id="l1824"></a>&amp; lying wonders &amp; a strong delusion &amp; reign as a God in the Church  untill <a id="l1825"></a>the day of judgment, that is,  it  was to reign in the Church with divine authority an authority which all Christi<a id="l1826"></a>ans whose names are not writen in the book of life should worship &amp; wonder after  as the infallible authority of God himself, &amp; by this <a id="l1828"></a>authority it should change times &amp; laws &amp; they should be given into its hands untill <a id="l1829"></a>the judgment should sit.</p>
<p id="par185">Now that which letted the Apostle does not name , but tells the churches that they <a id="l1830"></a>knew it already &amp; by the tradition of the first ages of Christianity it was the Roman <a id="l1831"></a>Empire: not   a  future Christian Empire  (for the Man of Sin was to be a Christian <a id="l1832"></a>dominion) but the heathen Roman Empire which reigned in the Apostles days <a id="l1833"></a>While this empire stood the Man of Sin who was to be a Christian Roman dominion could not rise up  but  <a id="l1834"></a>so soon as it should be taken out of the way  he was to be revealed. And because  <a id="l1835"></a>that which letted was to be taken out of the way therefore the Apostle does not name it least <a id="l1836"></a>he should  be blamed by the heathens as an enemy to  their Empire. So then we are here to consider <a id="l1837"></a>the working of the mystery of iniquity during the reign of the heathen Roman Empire <a id="l1838"></a>&amp; after the fall of that Empire to expect the rise of the man of sin.</p>
<p id="par186">Now the mystery of iniquity which worked in the Apostles days &amp; continued to <a id="l1839"></a>work till the end of the heathen Roman Empire was the heresies  which then sprang up &amp; whose authors Iohn <a id="l1841"></a>calls Antichrists. <em class="underline">Little children</em> saith he, <em class="underline">it is the last time; &amp; as ye have heard <a id="l1842"></a>that Antichrist shall come even now there are many Antichrists whereby we <a id="l1843"></a>know that it is the last time. They went out from us but they were not of us</em> &amp;c. <a id="l1844"></a>Which is as much as to say that as they had heard that Antichrist should come &amp; that the <a id="l1845"></a>last time was the time of  his reign,so by the many hereticks which had separated <a id="l1846"></a>from  the Church &amp; were the forerunners of the great Antichrist,  they might know that the last <a id="l1847"></a>time taken in a large sense so as to comprehend Antichrist with his forerunners <a id="l1848"></a>was already begun. Those heresies consisted chiefly in – – – – – – &amp; used <a id="l1849"></a>the signe of the cross as an amulet or charm against the devil &amp; his works, as <a id="l1850"></a>the Montanists.</p>

<p id="par232">He must also be taught in particular what those dead works are of which he is to repent <a id="l2095"></a>And these are comprehended in the promise made before baptism viz<sup>t</sup> to forsake <a id="l2096"></a>the Devil &amp; all his works the vain pomp &amp; glory of the world with all <a id="l2097"></a>covetous desires of the same &amp; the carnal desires of the flesh so as not <a id="l2098"></a>to  follow them nor to be led by them: that is he <a id="l2099"></a>promisses to forsake  the worships of fals Gods called the Devil, with all the <a id="l2100"></a>works accompanying it;  &amp; all ambition &amp; covetousness &amp;  unchastity.

For all that is in the world, the <a id="l2103"></a>lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes &amp;the pride of life is not of the father <a id="l2104"></a>but is of the world. So then the first Principles of the Oracles of God  or <a id="l2105"></a>the Principles of the doctrine of Christ  called by the Apostle repentance from dead works, faith <a id="l2106"></a>towards God, the doctrine of Baptisms &amp; of laying  on of hands &amp; of the resurrection <a id="l2107"></a>of the dead &amp; of eternal judgment, are comprehended in these things, in repen<a id="l2108"></a>tance from all Idolatry &amp; the works accompanying it, &amp; from all ambitious, covetous <a id="l2109"></a>&amp; unchast desires, in a right beleif in God &amp; Christ &amp; the Holy Ghost in whose <a id="l2110"></a>name we are to be baptized &amp; in the  death &amp; resurrection of Christ,  in the doctrine of Baptisms &amp; of laying on of hands consequent <a id="l2112"></a>thereupon, &amp; in that of the resurrection of the dead &amp; of eternal judgment.

In the beginning of <a id="l2117"></a>the Gospel nothing more was requisite to communion then these things. And to make <a id="l2118"></a>any thing  requisite to communion now which was not requisite to communion in <a id="l2119"></a>those days or to excommunicate any man now for any thing which was not requi<a id="l2120"></a>site to communion in the beginning, is  to alter the <a id="l2122"></a>fundamentals of the Christian religion, to teach another Gospel &amp; to create Schisms in <a id="l2123"></a>the Church. </p>
<p id="par233">Now  there were men appointed from the beginning to instruct novices <a id="l2124"></a>in the first principles of the Christian religion in order to baptism, &amp; those <a id="l2125"></a>that were so instructed were called Catechumens.

All these hereticks held <a id="l2246"></a>this doctrine of the Nicolaitans but yet with some diversity of language &amp; <a id="l2247"></a>circumstances. For some of them as Tatian Proclus &amp; Tertullian held the <a id="l2248"></a>Logus to be a person or substance endued with a proper life will &amp; under<a id="l2249"></a>standing &amp; distinguished but not  separated from the substance of the <a id="l2250"></a>father; &amp; others as Hermogenes, Æschines, Praxeas, Artemas Noetus, Sabellius, <a id="l2251"></a>Paul, Marcellus &amp; Photinus, held that the  Logus was only a power <a id="l2252"></a>seated in some dilated part of the fathers substance without any other <a id="l2253"></a>life will or understanding then that of the father. And again, some of them, <a id="l2254"></a>as Artemas Paul, Marcellus, Eustathius &amp; Photinus  held that the Logus only dwelt in <a id="l2255"></a>Iesus as the holy spirit doth in good men &amp; did the supernatural works &amp; <a id="l2256"></a>others as Montanus Hermogenes Praxeas  Tertullian Noetus &amp; Sabellius   <a id="l2257"></a>&amp; perhaps Proclus &amp; Æschines that he was united to Iesus so as to become passible. And thence Hermogenes <a id="l2258"></a>Praxeas, Noetus &amp; Sabellius were called patripassians. But all agreed in <a id="l2259"></a>distinguishing between the divine nature of Christ called the Word &amp; the <a id="l2260"></a> man  who took his beginning of the Virgin &amp; was  assumed by the <a id="l2261"></a>Word.</p>
<p id="par245">Montanus a Platonist refining the errors of the Gnosticks rejected their <a id="l2262"></a>Astronomical  Theology as too gross &amp; remote from the Christian religion &amp; retained <a id="l2263"></a>only those Æons  which might best be defended.   He took the <a id="l2264"></a>Son &amp; holy Ghost for emissions of the fathers substance, or Æons emitted from him <a id="l2265"></a>by efflux or projection of substance &amp; made them subordinate to him.</p>
<p id="par246">The true Christians which Tertullian here calls simple &amp; imprudent, in other places of his works he calls Psychici – <a id="l2266"></a>animal people, a name borrowed by the Cataphrygians from the Valentinian heresy. ffor <a id="l2267"></a>the Valentinians called themselves Pneumatici spiritual men &amp; the true Christians Psychici <a id="l2268"></a>Which confirms me in the opinion that Montanus refined the Valentinian heresy <a id="l2269"></a>rejecting the Astronomical Æons &amp; retaining only  so much of the Nicolaitan philosophy as was applicable to the  <a id="l2270"></a>Logus &amp; the Paracles &amp; to Angels &amp; the souls of men.</p>

<p id="par247">In this philosophy of the Cataphrygians the father is a fals God because the true <a id="l2271"></a>God emitts nothing from his substance. He is all eye, all ear all  sense, all under<a id="l2272"></a>standing, all wisdom, all power  &amp; has nothing in him which can be  emitted by  speaking, genera<a id="l2273"></a>ting, emanation,  dilation, projection  or any other act, from any thing els that <a id="l2274"></a>is in him &amp; to worship a God that  generates by emission of sub<a id="l2275"></a>stance is to worship  another God a strange God the God of Simon Magus &amp; the Gnosticks  the great Iupiter <a id="l2276"></a> of the heathens who was a man  deified &amp; exalted into the <a id="l2277"></a>throne of the supreme God &amp; is still said to retain the humane passions of love <a id="l2278"></a>&amp; lust &amp; generating by emission of substance. Also the Son in this Philosophy is a <a id="l2279"></a>fals God because a substance generated by emission of the fathers substance,  &amp; by consequence the son of God of the Gnosticks  the son of the heathen Iupiter, the Logus of <a id="l2281"></a>Orpheus  &amp; Plato,  &amp; Philo the λογος ἐνδιάθετος ἢ προ<a id="l2282"></a>φόρικος of the God of the Gnosticks, an Æon emitted from the substance of the God of the Gnosticks <a id="l2283"></a>as a ray from the sun,  a river from its fountain, &amp; a  tree from its root. And for the <a id="l2284"></a>same reason the Paraclete of the  Montanists is a  false <a id="l2285"></a>God  being an Æon emitted from the God of the Gnosticks. And therefore  the Christians <a id="l2286"></a>in Tertullians days were not mistaken in proclaiming the Montanists to be poly<a id="l2287"></a>theists.   When Iohn tells us that there <a id="l2289"></a>were many Antichrists  who went out from the church because they were <a id="l2290"></a>not of the Church, &amp; adds, Who is  a lyar but he that denyeth that Iesus is the Christ <a id="l2291"></a>&amp; He is Antichrist that denyeth the father &amp; the son; Whosoever denyeth the Son <a id="l2292"></a>the same hath not the father: in these sayings he speaks of the  Gnosticks of his days who  denyed that Iesus was the Christ  by distinguishing <a id="l2294"></a><span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>betwe<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>en them <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>an<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>d saying that Christ descended upon Iesus, &amp; who by denying that Iesus was the <a id="l2295"></a>Christ  denyed the Son, &amp; by denying the Son<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 143ar resumes &gt; </span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p144r"> &lt;144r&gt; </span> &amp; dividing the father into Æons denyed the father. And in the same manner that the Gnosticks denyed the <a id="l2296"></a>father &amp; the son  the Montanists also denyed them &amp;  in their stead <a id="l2297"></a>worshipped fals Gods a fals father &amp; a false son the heathen Iupiter &amp; a part or power of the heathen Iupiter. ffor as worshipping <a id="l2298"></a>fals Gods is denying the true God (Iob. 31.28) so in the language of Iohn <a id="l2299"></a>to deny the father is to worship a fals God in his room &amp; to deny the <a id="l2300"></a>son is to worship another Lord &amp;  another God then  the father  of our Lord  Iesus Christ. For  when Iohn tells us he that denyeth the Son hath not the father, He doth not mean that <a id="l2303"></a>he that denieth the son hath no God but that instead of the father he hath another God  Every Christian who by fals <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>wisdome<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> denys that Iesus is the Christ or that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh denies the son &amp; hath a fals son &amp; he that hath a fals son hath a <a id="l2305"></a>fals father &amp; denyes the true father &amp; the true son &amp; is an idolater &amp; this is the <a id="l2306"></a>spirit of Antichrist according to the Apostle. To distinguish the supreme God into parts <a id="l2307"></a>&amp; make him generate by emission  of substance  is to have &amp; worship the Iupiter of <a id="l2308"></a>the heathens instead of  the God of the Christians &amp; to worship the parts  or powers of the <a id="l2309"></a>supreme God as  the son &amp; spirit of the supreme God is to worship the <a id="l2310"></a>son &amp; spirit of the Iupiter of the heathens. And this was the case of the Mon<a id="l2311"></a>tanists as the Christians of those days represented. ffor they accused the Montanists <a id="l2312"></a>of dividing the unity of the supreme God &amp; thereby becoming polytheists, &amp; when <a id="l2313"></a> the Montanists excused this division by calling  God  One God with an œconomy, they waxed pale at this œconomy as  a palliation of polytheism like the œconomy of the heathens who siad that <a id="l2316"></a>they worshipped but one God because all their Gods were but one, being nothing els then parts <a id="l2317"></a>or powers of the supreme Iupiter. The God of the Gnosticks was the Iupiter <a id="l2318"></a>of the heathens because they made him generate by emission of seed into Ennœa.  <a id="l2319"></a>And as the heathens sometimes considered their Gods as both male &amp; female  <a id="l2320"></a>&amp; said that Minerva was born of Iupiters brain &amp; Bacchus of his thigh, so the <a id="l2321"></a>Gnosticks made  their supreme God both male &amp; female &amp; said that <a id="l2322"></a>Ennœa  was born of  him alone as the first conception of his <a id="l2323"></a>mind &amp; so the Cataphrygians made the Logus the son of the first God without <a id="l2324"></a>the help of any other female then himself, &amp; said that he was first conceived <a id="l2325"></a>in him &amp; then born out of him being the λογος ενδιάθετος by conception &amp; the <a id="l2326"></a>λόγος προφορικὸς by birth.</p>

<p id="par252">Among the many nations conquered by  Ermaneric I reccon <a id="l2358"></a>the Lombards. Paulus Diaconus tells us that  <a id="l2359"></a>they lived in Pannonia 42 years,  &amp; went thence into Italy <a id="l2360"></a>in April A.C. 568. They came into Pannonia therefore A.C. 526. They <a id="l2361"></a>were led thither  over the Danube by Audoin their ninth <a id="l2362"></a>King,  the Emperor granting them seats. They  were seated before beyond the Danube in the confines of <a id="l2363"></a>the Heruli &amp; the Suevi, &amp; before that in a country called Rugi<a id="l2364"></a>land or the country of Rugis, a place on the north side of the <a id="l2365"></a>Danube over against Noricum whither they were led by Gudehoc <a id="l2366"></a>that is about the year 476.  Paulus Diaconus tells us they were  <a id="l2368"></a>Germans originaly called Winuli &amp; from their long beards Longo<a id="l2369"></a>bardi, &amp; came out of  Scandinavia (so the ancients under the conduct <a id="l2370"></a>of two captains Ibor &amp; Ayon who led them  against the Vandals whom they routed &amp; that after the death of these two captains they <a id="l2372"></a>set up kings over them the first of which reigned 33 years &amp; was <a id="l2373"></a>slain by the Bulgares, &amp; the third reigned 40 years. Whence <a id="l2374"></a>its probable that they were a Vandalic nation (as the name Winuli imports &amp; above an <a id="l2375"></a>hundred years before the Heruli invaded Italy, came  out of Gothland in the southern parts of  the great <a id="l2378"></a>peninsula of Sweden &amp; Norway  by the ancients called Scanzia <a id="l2379"></a>&amp; Scandinavia &amp; taken for an Island in the Baltic sea, &amp; landing  near the Oder, came amongst the Vandals, Bulgars, Rugij, Heruli <a id="l2381"></a>Suevi &amp; Gepides &amp; other nations subject first to Ermanreic &amp; then to <a id="l2382"></a>Attila &amp; upon the death of Attila were left on the north side of <a id="l2383"></a>the Danube neare the Gepides. The Greeks say that the Lombards were descend<a id="l2384"></a>ed from the Gepides, &amp; therefore in the opinion of the Greeks they <a id="l2385"></a>were the subjects  of Attila.</p>

<p id="par253">Among these nations I reccon also the Lombards who (according <a id="l2386"></a>to Iornandes) came originally out of  Scandinavia or Scanza in the Baltic <a id="l2387"></a>sea &amp; were called Winuli (that  is Vandals) &amp; (from their beards) Longo<a id="l2388"></a>bardi, &amp; under the conduct of their captains Ibor &amp; Ayon  <a id="l2389"></a>attacqued &amp; routed the Vandals &amp;  after the death of these <a id="l2390"></a>captains were governed by  the following kings.

And Procopius in the beginning of his Historia Vandalica writes to the same purpose.   And <a id="l2429"></a>Constantinus Porphyrogenita Emperor of Constantinople transcribed out <a id="l2430"></a>of the History of Theophanes Γήπαιδες ἐξ ὡν ὕστερον διηρέθησαν <a id="l2431"></a>Λογγοβάρδοι, Gepidæ ex quibus dissidio facto orti Langobardi.

<p id="par255">Prosper &amp; Iornandes &amp; Paulus  Warnefridus tell us that the Lombards seking new seats came out of <a id="l2434"></a>Scandinavia under the conduct of Ibor &amp; Ayon &amp; first set upon  the <a id="l2435"></a>Vandals &amp; routed them, &amp; Prosper places this victory in the year next after the death <a id="l2436"></a>of Valens Ausonio et Olybrio Coss. A.C. 379. Whence its probable that Lombards came over the Danube with the other Gothic nations in the reign of Valens. The Vandals had  <a id="l2437"></a>lived quietly in Pannonia about 40 years before this incursion, &amp; tho they  now retired <a id="l2438"></a>from the Lombards, yet they did not quit Pannonia before Stilico <a id="l2439"></a>invited them against the Western Empire. When therefore the <a id="l2440"></a>Hunns invaded Pannonia, they found the Lombards there. Prosper <a id="l2441"></a>tells us that in the Consulship of Timasius &amp; Promotus A.C. 389 the  Lom<a id="l2442"></a>bards made Agilmundus their first king &amp; that he was succeeded by La<a id="l2443"></a>missus their second king in year 423.</p>
<p id="par256">In the reign of Hermaneric the Lombards came out of Scandinavia  under the <a id="l2444"></a>conduct of Ibor &amp; Ayon to seek new seats. They were then called Winuli but <a id="l2445"></a>afterwards from their long beards had the name of  Longobards given them.

<p id="par274"><img title="Symbol (3 dots in circles arranged as an inverted triangle) in text" src="/resources/images/texts/symbol.gif" alt="Symbol (3 dots in circles arranged as an inverted triangle) in text"> And even the great Athanasius who died in the year 373 was <a id="l2598"></a>of the same opinion from his youth. For in his Epistle to Marcellinus concerning the  book of the Psalms, he introduces an old man calling him his Son &amp; giving <a id="l2599"></a>him many advices concerning the interpretation &amp; use of this book,  <a id="l2600"></a>which he recommended to Marcellinus particularly that <em class="underline">no man under a shew of eloquence</em> should be <a id="l2601"></a> induced to adorn the Psalms with secular words nor endeavour to trans<a id="l2602"></a>pose the sayings or anywise to change them, but without any artifice to recite &amp; sing <a id="l2603"></a>them as they are spoken, that the  holy men who  as Gods  servants delivered them to us, knowing their <a id="l2605"></a>own words may pray with us,  or rather that the holy spirit <a id="l2606"></a>who spake in the holy men seing his own words with which he <a id="l2607"></a>inspired them, may join [with them] in assisting us in our prayers. Certainly, said the old <a id="l2608"></a>man, I have heard from prudent men that anciently in Israel <a id="l2609"></a> by the reading of the scriptures alon<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l2610"></a>they put the devils to flight &amp; detected their stratagems against <a id="l2611"></a>men. And therefore, said he, they are worthy of all condemnation who <a id="l2612"></a>omitting these, &amp; using foreign  elegant words, from those name <a id="l2613"></a>themselves exorcists. ffor they rather trifle &amp; offer themselves to be de<a id="l2614"></a>rided by the devils as happened to the sons of Sceva the Iew who <a id="l2615"></a>attempted to exorcise in this manner. For the Devils hearing such things <a id="l2616"></a>mock at them but are afraid of the words of the saints &amp; cannot <a id="l2617"></a>bear them. This was the doctrine which Athanasius imbibed in his youth <a id="l2618"></a>&amp;  in the name of the old man recommended to Marcellinus. For cer<a id="l2619"></a>tainly this Epistle &amp; the Exposition of Athanasius upon the Psalms was writ in the reign of Constantine the great, the <a id="l2620"></a>discourses therein  concerning the Divinity of Christ being suitable to tho<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>se<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p148v"> &lt;148v&gt; </span> times &amp; conteining nothing which may relate to the times after the <a id="l2621"></a>Council of Tyre not  to say after the Council of Nice. Let these discour<a id="l2622"></a>ses be compared with the discourses of Athanasius in his Orations <a id="l2623"></a>contra Gentes written before the times of the  homousian <a id="l2624"></a>controversy &amp; they will appear to be much of a piece. For he then <a id="l2625"></a>attributed supernatural effects to words &amp; the sign of the cross.</p>

<p id="par276">Hilary who died in the year 368, not only ascribed super<a id="l2627"></a>natural effects to the reliques of saints as you have heard but <a id="l2628"></a> also declared for the invocation of Angels &amp; saints. For upon <a id="l2629"></a>the 129<sup>th</sup> Psalm he writes thus. It is not the nature of God but <a id="l2630"></a>our infirmity which wants the intercession of Angels. ffor they are <a id="l2631"></a>sent for the  sake of those who shall inherit  salva<a id="l2632"></a>tion, God being ignorant of none of those things which we do <a id="l2633"></a>but our infirmity wanting the ministry of spiritual intercessi<a id="l2634"></a>on to ask &amp; merit. And so upon the 124<sup>th</sup> Psalm: Neither <a id="l2635"></a>the custody of the saints nor the protection of Angels are <a id="l2636"></a>wanting to those who desire to stand. And a little after: And <a id="l2637"></a>least we should beleive it to be a light  safeguard <a id="l2638"></a>which is placed in the  Apostles or Patriarchs &amp; Prophets <a id="l2639"></a>or rather in the Angels which do compass the Church with a <a id="l2640"></a>certain custody, it is added:  And the Lord encompasses his <a id="l2641"></a>people henceforth &amp; for ever.  But perhaps the custody <a id="l2642"></a>of the Apostles or Angels may be thought sufficient: It is <a id="l2643"></a>true, but &amp;c.</p>
<p id="par277">Ambrose who was made Bishop of Millain A.C. 374 &amp; <a id="l2644"></a>died A.C. 397, concludes – – – – – cohæredes Dei. And in his book de <a id="l2645"></a>viduis he writes thus. When Peters wives mother was taken with a <a id="l2646"></a>great feaver, Andrew intreated the Lord for her –––– &amp; thou hast <a id="l2647"></a>neighbours to supplicate God for thee. Thou hast the Apostles thy <a id="l2648"></a>neighbours, Thou hast the martyrs thy neighbours – – – The Angels <a id="l2649"></a>are to be intreated for us who are granted to us for a safeguard <a id="l2650"></a>the Martyrs are to be intreated whose patronage  by the pledge <a id="l2651"></a>of their bodies we seem to chalenge. They can supplicate for our <a id="l2652"></a>sins because by their own blood if they had any sins they have<a id="l2653"></a>washed them away. For they are the martyrs of God, our Presidents, the inspectors of our lives &amp; actions. Let us not blush therefore to use them as <a id="l2654"></a>intercessors of our infirmities because when they overcame they <a id="l2655"></a>knew the infirmities of the body.<br><br></p>

<p id="par298">There were at this time some barbarian kingdoms in the western Empire but <a id="l2821"></a>as soon as they became converted to the Roman catholick faith they submitted <a id="l2822"></a>to the dominion of the sea of Rome.</p>
<p id="par299"> Now tho the Western Emperors for the peace of their Empire set up <a id="l2823"></a>this ecclesiastical dominion of their Imperial city, yet the Bishop of Rome colour<a id="l2824"></a>ed over his claim with other pretenses. So Pope Innocent I in his Decretal <a id="l2825"></a>epistle to Decentius bishop of Eugubium. A.C. 406,  represents that <a id="l2826"></a>– – – – head of their institution: an argument that would subject Rome to <a id="l2827"></a>Illyricum &amp; both to Asia &amp; Antioch &amp; Antioch to Ierusalem. And in almost <a id="l2828"></a>all the decretal Epistles  obedience to the Apostolic sea &amp; chair of <a id="l2829"></a>Peter is inculcated, whereas the Church of Rome was of the uncircumcision &amp; <a id="l2830"></a>Peter was an Apostle of the circumcision &amp; none of the Apostles were bis<a id="l2831"></a>hops of any cities. They were not confined to residence in single cities but sent to <a id="l2832"></a>preach to the whole world, &amp; left no successors in this mission. Nor were the <a id="l2833"></a>Churches of Asia during the reign of Vespasian Titus Domitian &amp; Nerva under <a id="l2834"></a>the government of the Bishops of Rome but under that of the Apostle Iohn <a id="l2835"></a> And as for that text Thou art Peter &amp; upon this rock will <a id="l2836"></a>I build my church: it was personal &amp; was fulfilled in Peter when by his <a id="l2837"></a>first sermon he converted three thousand &amp; therby founded the church of the <a id="l2838"></a>circumcision &amp; afterwards by the calling of Cornelius founded also the Church of <a id="l2839"></a>the uncircumcision.  Arguments drawn from these heads might <a id="l2840"></a>help to  colour over this dominion with a shew of religion when it was set up:   but it was set up &amp; established <a id="l2842"></a>by the Edicts of Gratian &amp; Valentinian. When the Bishops of Asia deposed <a id="l2843"></a>Paul of Samosat the heathen Emperor Aurelian referred the matter to the bishop of his imperial <a id="l2844"></a>city Rome. When the bishops of Afric referred their case to the hearing of the <a id="l2845"></a>Gallican bishops the Emperor Constantine the great  added the bishop of Rome <a id="l2846"></a>, &amp; soon after the Council of Nice gave him the primacy of honour  &amp; <a id="l2847"></a>when Constantinople was built &amp; made the head of the eastern Empire <a id="l2848"></a>the second general Council gave the primacy to the bishop of this city next <a id="l2849"></a>after Rome, as being new Rome.</p>

<p id="par316">Now that Sabellianism &amp; Montanism – – – – – ὁμοιούσιος to the father as well <a id="l2993"></a>as ὁμοούσιος.</p>
<p id="par317">After this conviction the homousians began to change their <a id="l2994"></a>language of one hypostasis to that of three, &amp;  to call those sabellians who still <a id="l2996"></a>adhered to the language of one hypostasis &amp;  mutually to be called <a id="l2997"></a>Arians by them for changing their language. And in this state things conti<a id="l2998"></a>nued till the reign of Iulian the Apostate when Athanasius recon<a id="l2999"></a>ciled the two parties about their language  telling them that <a id="l3000"></a>one party by their language of one hypostasis understood  one <a id="l3001"></a>substance in nature &amp; species &amp; the other by their language of three <a id="l3002"></a>hypostases understood three substances in number. And this exposition <a id="l3003"></a>was allowed by the Bishop of Rome. ffor Ierom a little after the <a id="l3004"></a>reign of  the Emperor Iulian coming into  Syria <a id="l3005"></a> &amp; there being reprehended for using the language of one hypostasis would not change <a id="l3006"></a>his language till he had written to Pope Damasus about it. </p>
<p id="par318">In these disputes Arius &amp; Athanasius had both of them perplexed <a id="l3007"></a>the Church with metaphysical opinions &amp; expressed their opinions in <a id="l3008"></a>novel language not warranted by scripture. The Greeks  to <a id="l3009"></a>preserve the Church from these innovations &amp; metaphysical perplexitys <a id="l3010"></a> &amp; put an end to the troubles occasioned by them <a id="l3012"></a>anathematized the novel language of Arius in several of their Councils, <a id="l3013"></a>&amp; so soon as they were able repealed the novel language of the <a id="l3014"></a>homousians, &amp; contended that the language of the scripture was to be <a id="l3015"></a>adhered unto. The Homousians  made the father &amp; son one God <a id="l3016"></a>by a metaphysical unity the unity of substance: the Greek Churches <a id="l3017"></a>rejected all metaphysical divinity as well that of Arius as that <a id="l3018"></a>of  the Homousians &amp; made the father &amp; son one <a id="l3019"></a>God by a Monarchical unity, an unity of Dominion, the Son  receiving all things from the father, being subject <a id="l3021"></a>to him,  executing his will , sitting in his throne &amp; calling him his <a id="l3022"></a>God,  &amp; so is but one God with the ffather as a king &amp; his viceroy <a id="l3023"></a>are but one king. ffor the word God relates not to the metaphysical <a id="l3024"></a>nature of God but to his dominion.  It is a relative word &amp; has <a id="l3026"></a>relation to us as the servants of God. It is a word of the same signification <a id="l3027"></a>with Lord &amp; King but in a higher degree. For as we say my Lord our Lord <a id="l3028"></a>your Lord, other Lords,  the King of Kings &amp; Lord of Lords, other Lords, the servants of the Lord, serve other Lords so we say <a id="l3029"></a>my God our God your God, other Gods the God of Gods,  the servants of God, serve other Gods.  And therefore as  a father &amp; his sons cannot be called one King <a id="l3031"></a>upon account of their being consubstantial but may be called one King <a id="l3032"></a>by unity of dominion if the son be Viceroy under the father: so God &amp; his son <a id="l3033"></a>cannot be called one God upon account of their being consubstantial.  The heathens made all their Gods of one substance &amp; sometimes called them one God &amp; yet were polytheists. Nothing can make two persons one God  but unity of dominion. And if the Father &amp; Son be united in domini<a id="l3035"></a>on, the son being subordinate to the father &amp; sitting in his throne, they can no more be called two Gods <a id="l3036"></a>then a King &amp; his Viceroy can be called two kings.</p>

<p id="par371" class="i0">their land: the second – – – – – – Mahuzzims. The first interval is ushered in <a id="l3278"></a>with these words But it shal not prosper – – – – – – shall fall in the reign <a id="l3279"></a>&amp; by the persecution of this king till the time of the end. For it is to <a id="l3280"></a>be noted that this second intervall of time consists of two parts.  <a id="l3281"></a>The first part precedes the time of the end; the second is called the <a id="l3282"></a>time of the end. In the first part the king who doth according to his will <a id="l3283"></a>sets up the transgression of worshipping  the Mahuzzims  with a strange God &amp; those of understanding fall <a id="l3284"></a>&amp; grow few: in the second the people of this king continue to worship  the Mahuzzims thus set up  &amp; the few remaining saints continue  <a id="l3286"></a>in a state of affliction dispersion &amp; desolation  under <a id="l3287"></a>the persecuting transgressors, whose transgression is therefore called the transgression <a id="l3288"></a>of desolation.</p>

<p id="par372" class="i0">The Angel Gabriel in interpreting the  Vision of the he Goat tells Daniel that this <a id="l3289"></a>rough goat is the king of Greece &amp; the great horn that is between his eyes is the first <a id="l3290"></a>king  And that being broken whereas four stood up for it <a id="l3291"></a>four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation but not in his power And in the <a id="l3292"></a>latter time of their kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full a king <a id="l3293"></a>of fierce countenance  &amp; understanding dark sentences shall stand <a id="l3294"></a>up &amp; his power shall be mighty but not by his own power. By kings he understands kingdoms. And because the period of time when the transgressors are come to the full <a id="l3295"></a>relates to the vision concerning the daily worship &amp; the transgression of desolation <a id="l3296"></a>which was to last 2300 prophetick days, the  same Angel Gabriel in the prophesy of the scripture <a id="l3297"></a>of truth, which (as I said) is a  commentary upon the Vision of the he goat, after <a id="l3298"></a>he had described the rise of he kingdom of Greece represented by the first horn of the Goat &amp; its breaking into four <a id="l3299"></a>kingdoms represented by the four next horns, to point out the period of time called the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressors are come to <a id="l3300"></a>the full, he describes the particular actions of  the single kings of two of the <a id="l3301"></a>four kingdoms which he calls the king of the north &amp; south &amp; prosecutes the <a id="l3302"></a>description to the eighth year of Antiochus Epiphanes, the year in which the <a id="l3303"></a>Romans conquered Macedon &amp;  at that period of time passes from  describing  the kings of the north <a id="l3304"></a>&amp; south to describe the  affairs of the arms which  at that time begin to stand up. <a id="l3305"></a>And therefore the eighth year of Antiochus is the period of time  called <a id="l3306"></a> the latter time of the kingdom of the four horns when the transgressors <a id="l3307"></a>are come to the full &amp; the king of fierce countenance begins to stand up  <a id="l3308"></a> &amp; the arms which then begin to stand up   are this king <a id="l3309"></a>of fierce countenance,  or last horn of the Goat, &amp; the <a id="l3310"></a> remaining part of the prophesy of the scripture of truth <a id="l3311"></a>relates to that horn. And this I take to be the true reason why the Angel <a id="l3312"></a>after he comes to this period, insists no longer upon the particular actions of <a id="l3313"></a>the single kings of the north &amp; south but passes on   through all the kings following <a id="l3314"></a>by  touching only  upon the main turns of affairs relating to <a id="l3315"></a>the reign of the last horn.</p>
<p id="par373">And it is to be observed that the Angel in passing on from this period <a id="l3316"></a>downwards to the end of the prophesy proceeds by two large  intervalls of <a id="l3317"></a>time answering to the double reign of the last horn,  that which <a id="l3318"></a>followed its  waxing great towards the pleasant land &amp; to the host of heaven &amp; that which followed its  growing up <a id="l3319"></a> to the Prince of the host. The first intervall</p>
<p id="par374"> This practising &amp; prospering   relates to the time of the end is ready to co <a id="l3320"></a>For the vision is said to be at the time of the end &amp; at the last end of the indignation .  The  setting up the Transgression  was attempted by <a id="l3324"></a>Antiochus Epiphanes but was not then to prosper till the time of the end because the time of the end was not come. But   <a id="l3325"></a>the king who doth according to his will  prospers till the indignation be accomplished <a id="l3326"></a>&amp; therefore the abomination of the mahuzzims  lasts all the time of the end  <a id="l3327"></a>till the sanctuary be cleansed.  For the time <a id="l3328"></a>of the end is now commencing.</p>

The first interval conteins the mighty reign <a id="l3335"></a>of the Greeks by  or under the power of the Romans from the 8<sup>th</sup> year of Antio<a id="l3336"></a>chus in which that power began  till the division of the Roman Empire &amp; separation of the <a id="l3337"></a>Greeks from the Latines whereby that  reign came to an end.

<p id="par380">The first interval conteins the reign of this  horn by the power of the Romans; the <a id="l3351"></a>second conteins the reign &amp; fate of this horn of the Greeks  after separation from the Latines. The first <a id="l3352"></a>begins with the 8<sup>th</sup> year of Antiochus inclusively this being the year in which the Romans <a id="l3353"></a>conquered Macedon &amp; began to reign over the Greeks, &amp; ends with the division of the <a id="l3354"></a>Roman Empire into the Greek &amp; Latine Empires this division putting an end to the <a id="l3355"></a>reign of the Romans or Latines over the Greeks. The second intervall extends from <a id="l3356"></a>the time of that division to the end of the prophesy &amp; day of judgment. The first interval <a id="l3357"></a>comprehends the taking away of the Iewish daily worship &amp; placing the abomination of <a id="l3358"></a>desolation in their land: the second interval comprehends the taking away of the <a id="l3359"></a>Christian daily worship &amp; the placing the abomination of desolation in the sanctuary <a id="l3360"></a>of the  Christians which abomination is represented by the honouring of a strange God together with Mahuzzims. The first interval conteins the rise of the <a id="l3361"></a>last horn of the Goat up to the host of heaven &amp; his reign in which he cast down some of <a id="l3362"></a>stars to the ground, the second interval conteins his usurpation of the throne of the Prince of the host</p>

<p id="par394">For as the Heathens &amp; Hereticks beleived all their Gods to be of one substance <a id="l3469"></a>with the first God, so all the Christians who beleived the Son to be the λόγος <a id="l3470"></a>ἐνδιάθετος of the father must of necessity have beleived that he was  of <a id="l3471"></a>one substance with the father, this opinion being the consequence of <a id="l3472"></a>the former. And yet this opinion was the foundation of the  theology of the <a id="l3473"></a>heathens Cabbalists &amp; Gnosticks &amp; when the Montanists applied it to the <a id="l3474"></a>Trinity &amp; gave the name of Oeconomy to their disposition of the Trinity, the  major part of Christians both Greks &amp; Latines who flourished in the <a id="l3475"></a> beginning of the  third century  (that is, the body of the Church Catholick) were frighted at this doctrin <a id="l3476"></a>(as you have heard out of Tertullian) &amp; accounted it polytheism &amp; therefore looked upon the Montanists as heathens &amp; idolaters. ffor as the <a id="l3477"></a>heathens were guilty of polytheism notwithstanding that they beleived all <a id="l3478"></a>their Gods to be of one substance  &amp; accounted them all to be but one Iove &amp; sometime called them one God so the Montanists might be polytheists <a id="l3480"></a>notwithstanding that they beleived the Tinity to be unius substantiæ <a id="l3481"></a>&amp; called it one God,  ffor the affirming the three <a id="l3483"></a>persons to be but one God amounts to nothing more then a denial of the <a id="l3484"></a>crime of polytheism, &amp; a bare denial of a crime doth not free men from <a id="l3485"></a>being guilty. And if it did, it would free the heathens as well as the Montanists <a id="l3486"></a>from this crime. Tertullian indeed calls the Christians who opposed the <a id="l3487"></a>Montanists, simplices quosque &amp; imprudentes &amp; Idiotas quæ  major semper creden<a id="l3488"></a>tium pars est, but in doing so he  calls himself a Gnostick. <a id="l3489"></a>ffor the  Gospel was adapted to the understanding of the meanest of <a id="l3490"></a>the people,   &amp; preached to the poor. <em class="underline">Father</em> <a id="l3491"></a>saith Christ, <em class="underline">I thank thee that thou hast hid these things from the wise &amp; <a id="l3492"></a>prudent of this world &amp; revealed them to babes</em>. And therefore we are to <a id="l3493"></a>look for Apostolick tranditions amongst Tertullians simple people &amp; to account <a id="l3494"></a>all such learned metaphysical doctrines as are above the reach of these people to be the inventi<a id="l3495"></a>ons of the wise &amp; prudent of this world. The common people are tenacious of traditions, the learned are apt to intermix their own opinions.</p>
<p id="par395">As by Tertullians testimony it appears that the body of Christians  in his <a id="l3496"></a>days  both Greeks &amp; Latines were very averse from placing the unity of the Deity in  a metaphysical unity  or unity of <a id="l3497"></a>substance &amp; could not so much as hear the opinion with patience accounting the Montanists to be Idolaters: so it appears by the proceedings of the Council of Antioch against <a id="l3498"></a>Paul of Samosat that the Churches continued against it till those days. <a id="l3499"></a>This Council met 55 years before the Council of Nice &amp; consisted of about 80 bishops &amp; her sentence against Paul <a id="l3500"></a>rejected the ὁμοούσιος &amp; her sentence was communicated to all the Churches &amp; unanimously approved by them <a id="l3501"></a> &amp; confirmed by the bishops of Rome &amp; Italy even in <a id="l3502"></a>writing &amp; therefore the ὁμοούσιος or doctrine of the λογος being one God with the father by <em class="underline">unity of substance</em> was then rejected <a id="l3503"></a>by the voluntary &amp; unanimous consent of the Church Catholick. And  when she had <a id="l3504"></a>once rejected it she had no authority to receive it afterwards, because <a id="l3505"></a>by rejecting it she declared tradition to be against it.  For in matters of faith <a id="l3506"></a>she has no authority to vary from tradition, no not in point of language. For <a id="l3507"></a>the faith which was once delivered to the saints is only to be known by the <a id="l3508"></a>language in which it was delivered, &amp; therefore the Church is commanded to keep <a id="l3509"></a>to the form of sound words.</p>
<p id="par396">And yet  by the writings &amp; discourses of Theophilus, Athenagoras, Clemens &amp; Tertul<a id="l3510"></a>lian &amp; their friends &amp; followers, the  opinion that the  son of God was  λόγος ἐνδιάθε<a id="l3511"></a>τος καὶ προφόρικος   the internal &amp; prolatitious word of the father, spread so much in the Churches  in the third &amp; fourth centurys  as to <a id="l3513"></a> <a id="l3514"></a>taint the   Emperor Constantine the great <a id="l3515"></a>with his favorite Hosius &amp; the Bishops of Rome &amp; Alexandria with those of their party who  subscribed the Letters of  <a id="l3516"></a>the bishop of Alexandria &amp; by their means tho not without much opposition to <a id="l3517"></a>get the word ὁμοούσιος  inserted into the <a id="l3518"></a>Creed by the Council of Nice. The Emperor to influence the bishops published <a id="l3519"></a>his opinion  in all the Cities before the Council met, &amp; when they met &amp;  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p161v"> &lt;161v&gt; </span> could not agree he came in person into the Council upon a <a id="l3520"></a>day appointed, &amp; proposed &amp; pressed the ὁμοούσιος &amp; got it re<a id="l3521"></a>ceived into the Creed before he went out of the Council <a id="l3522"></a>giving the bishops no time to consider the danger of admitting <a id="l3523"></a>the  condemned language of hereticks. Yet the Bishops <a id="l3524"></a>cautioned that it should not be understood in the sense of the <a id="l3525"></a>hereticks nor signify any thing more then ὁμοιούσιος  the words ὁμος &amp; ὅμοιος <a id="l3527"></a> being  commonly taken in the same signification. But Hosius,<sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n32-ref">[32]</sup> who <sup>f</sup><sup class="note" id="n33-ref">[33]</sup>published the Nicene Creed &amp; by consequence translated <a id="l3528"></a>it into Latin, rendred the word ὁμοούσιος by <em class="underline">unius</em> <a id="l3529"></a>substantiæ &amp; the Greeks of that perswasion translated unius <a id="l3530"></a>substantiæ by μιας ὀυσίας &amp; μιας ὑποστάσεως &amp; this <a id="l3531"></a>language being frequently used instead of ομοουσιος &amp; being more apt to be understood in the sense of the hereticks became a snare &amp; stumbling block to the <a id="l3532"></a>people,  especially  to the Latines who used only the translation. Whence the Greeks<sup>g</sup><sup class="note" id="n34-ref">[34]</sup> began soon to look upon the <a id="l3534"></a>Latines as inclining to Montanism &amp; Sabellianism &amp; to put a stop to the growth of those opinions anathematized them in their Councils &amp; the <a id="l3535"></a>Latines mutually<sup>h</sup><sup class="note" id="n35-ref">[35]</sup> charged the Greeks with polytheism &amp; <a id="l3536"></a>Arianism for calling the  ffather Son &amp; Holy Ghost <a id="l3537"></a>three Hypostases &amp; in their <sup>i</sup><sup class="note" id="n36-ref">[36]</sup>Councils endeavoured to free themselves from the imputation of Sabellianism. And even those who used the  word <a id="l3538"></a>ὁμοούσιος at length fell out amongst themselves some  continuing to call the <a id="l3539"></a>father son &amp; holy Ghost one hypostasis, others to avoid the imputation of Sabellianism, calling them three hypostases, <a id="l3540"></a>&amp; these two parties called  one another Sabellians &amp; Arians <a id="l3541"></a>till Athanasius in the reign of Iulian the Apostate <a id="l3542"></a>reconciled them &amp; made them understand that tho they <a id="l3543"></a> differed in language yet they agreed in sense, one party by <a id="l3544"></a>one hypostasis meaning one in species &amp; nature, the <a id="l3545"></a>other party by three hypostases meaning three in <a id="l3546"></a>number. And thence forward the homousian Greeks to free themselves from the imputation of Sabellianism, began wholy to leave <a id="l3547"></a>of the language of one usia &amp; one hypostasis &amp;  constantly to use the language <a id="l3548"></a>of one usia &amp; three hypostases  meaning one substance <a id="l3549"></a>in nature &amp; species &amp; three in number &amp; the Latines <a id="l3550"></a>thenceforward used the language of one substance &amp; three persons <a id="l3551"></a>in the same sense.</p>
<p id="par397">And that Sabellianism &amp; Montanism by the influence &amp; <a id="l3552"></a>under the protection of the language of una substantia in Latin translation of the Creed <a id="l3553"></a>spread very much in the Latin Churches  Hilary in an Epistle which he wrote A.C. 358 from Phrygia to the  <a id="l3555"></a>Bishops of Gallia &amp; Britain thus acknowledges. Multi ex <a id="l3556"></a>nobis, fratres charissimi, ita unam substantiam Patris et ffilij <a id="l3557"></a>prædicant ut videre possint non magis pie quam impie prædi<a id="l3558"></a>care: habet enim – – – – – – ὁμοιούσιος to the father as well as ὁμοούσιος <a id="l3559"></a> And by this conviction I conceive it was that Sabellianism fell <a id="l3560"></a>in the west, &amp; that the homousian Greeks began to  use  the <a id="l3561"></a>language of three hypostases  &amp; not long after, <a id="l3562"></a>were  generally reconciled  to it by Athanasius in order to bring <a id="l3563"></a>over the Greeks more easily to his party. For at this time  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p162r"> &lt;162r&gt; </span> his party was very low  &amp; wanted <a id="l3564"></a>art to revive it  the world being now against him But after the reign of Constantius &amp; <a id="l3565"></a>Iulian,  an Emperour of his own opinion came to the crown <a id="l3566"></a>&amp; began to give new life to  his affairs.  ffor Iovian  succeeding Iulian recalled <a id="l3570"></a>the excommunicated &amp; banished bishops &amp; demanding  an account <a id="l3571"></a>of their faith favoured that of Athanasius, as  his contem<a id="l3572"></a>porary Gregory Nazianzen thus describes, <sup class="note" id="n37-ref">[37]</sup>Iovianus, ut pul<a id="l3573"></a>cherrimum  imperij sui fundamentum jaceret rectamque legum <a id="l3574"></a>sanctionem – – – – – – partem animo tenus pietatem colunt <a id="l3575"></a>–– partim eam igniculi cujusdam instar nonnihil accendunt <a id="l3576"></a>–– partim denique omni verborum libertate veritatem <a id="l3577"></a>prædicant.

<span class="pagenumber" id="p163r"> &lt;163r&gt; </span>
<p id="par398">The homousian controversy  lasted till the death of the <a id="l3579"></a>Emperor Valens A.C. 378 &amp; was managed between the Latine <a id="l3580"></a>Churches &amp;  chiefly the Church of  Rome on the one hand &amp; <a id="l3581"></a>the Greek Churches &amp; chiefly the churches of Asia on the other. Th</p>
<p id="par399">In the year 341 A.C.  Athanasius Bishop of Alexandria, Paul <a id="l3582"></a>of Constantinople, Marcellus of Ancyra &amp; Asclepas of Gaza having been <a id="l3583"></a>accused of various crimes &amp; deposed by the Greek Councils, fled to Rome &amp; <a id="l3584"></a>appealed from the Greek Councils to Iulius bishop of Rome: Iulius accepted <a id="l3585"></a>of the appeal, examined the appellants, received them into communion <a id="l3586"></a>&amp; called a Council of about 50 or 60 bishops of Italy &amp; the parts adjacent <a id="l3587"></a>to meet at Rome A.C. 342 &amp; cited the eastern Bishops then met <a id="l3588"></a>in a Council at Antioch, to appear in this Council at Rome &amp; justify <a id="l3589"></a>their proceedings. – – – – – – – – – –  because they appeared not when Iulius – – – – – – act of the eastern &amp; western Churches.</p>
<p id="par400">Six years after these things were done Constantius conquered Magnentius <a id="l3592"></a>the successor – – – – – – –  acknowledging the supreme &amp; absolute judicial  <a id="l3593"></a>authority of the Councils of the Greek Church over her own members.</p>
<p id="par401">After these things several Councils meeting at Sirmium, Nice in Thrace <a id="l3594"></a>Ariminum  Seleucia &amp; Constantinople in the years 357, 359 &amp; 360 <a id="l3595"></a>abolished the use of the words usia homousios &amp; homoiusios as not being in scripture &amp; occasioning great disturbances, alledging <a id="l3596"></a>also that the word  homousios was rejected by their fathers in the council of Antioch   long before the meeting of the Council of Nice, &amp; was  put <a id="l3598"></a>by the Council of Nice  sudenly or without mature deliberation  &amp; was a stumbling block to the people who understood it not in the sense of the Council. For Constantine the great coming in person into the Council proposed &amp; pressed the word ομοουσιος &amp; got it decreed in one day, &amp; the bishops having no time to deliberate, admitted the word with an interpretation that it should  be taken in the same sense with ομοιουσιος, not considering the danger  of admitting a word which was usually taken in another sense.  <a id="l3601"></a>: The  Latines used not the very word but translated it  unius <a id="l3604"></a>substantiæ &amp; by unius substantiæ the common people of the Latines &amp; even their Bishops were apt to  understand  one <a id="l3605"></a>common substance  of the  father &amp; son whether a previous substance out <a id="l3606"></a>of which  both were derived by division or one undivided substance <a id="l3607"></a>in which both subsisted;  as Hilary   complains in a letter written A.C. 358 to the  Bishops <a id="l3608"></a>of Gallia &amp; Britain, saying, <sup class="note" id="n38-ref">[38]</sup>Multi ex nobis, fratres charissimi, ita unam substan<a id="l3609"></a>tiam Patris et ffilij prædicant ut videri possint non magis id pie quam <a id="l3610"></a>impie prædicare Habet enim hoc verbum in se et fidei conscientiam &amp; fraudem paratam &amp;c &amp;c. And as for the people &amp; clergy of the eastern Churches, how <a id="l3611"></a> much they were either strangers to the word homousios or  against it  may appear by the character which the same Hilary in the <a id="l3613"></a>same letter<sup class="note" id="n39-ref">[39]</sup> gave of the eastern provinces where he was then in banishment. <a id="l3614"></a>Tantum ecclesiarum orientalium periculum est, saith he, ut rarum <a id="l3615"></a>sit hujus fidei [consubstantialis,] quæ qualis sit vos judicate, aut <a id="l3616"></a>sacerdotes aut poulum inveniri. –– Nam absque episcopo Eleusio <a id="l3617"></a>et paucis cum eo, ex majori parte Asianæ decem provinciæ <a id="l3618"></a>vere Deum nesciunt.</p>
<p id="par402">The new language above mentioned being for these reasons rejected, the Greek &amp; <a id="l3619"></a>Latin Churches continued  still  quiet till the end of the reign of the <a id="l3620"></a>Emperor Constantius &amp; his successor Iulian the last heathen <a id="l3621"></a>Emperor.

They  were so far from professing Arianism that they anathema<a id="l3632"></a>tized the proper language of Arius in several of their Councils. They published se<a id="l3633"></a>veral  Professions of faith &amp; I do not meet with any <a id="l3634"></a>heretical articles in any of them. If the Councils of Sirmium, Ariminum <a id="l3635"></a>&amp; Seleucia are called Arian for  rejecting the use of the word <a id="l3636"></a>homousios, the Council of Antioch which did the same thing 90 years <a id="l3637"></a>before must also be Arian  And if it be said that they were <a id="l3638"></a>Arians in their hearts; God only knows the hearts of men: we are to <a id="l3639"></a>judge of visible churches by their outward professions of faith <a id="l3640"></a> &amp; by their continuing in communion with the Church <a id="l3645"></a>catholick. The Church composed of the Greek &amp; Latine Churches &amp; of the Churches in Scythia &amp; Germany all of them in  <a id="l3646"></a>commuunion with one another in the reign of Iulian never separated from <a id="l3647"></a>the Church Catholick &amp; therefore was not schismatical. These Churches &amp; such others <a id="l3648"></a>as were in communion with them were the whole body of Christians throughout the whole world a <a id="l3649"></a>few separatists excepted &amp; therefore they were the church Catholick <a id="l3650"></a>of Christ. The Greek &amp; Latin Churches never separated from this Church <a id="l3651"></a>catholick nor from one another &amp; therefore were neither of them <a id="l3652"></a>schismatical. They contended with one another vehemently in the time of <a id="l3653"></a>the Council of Serdica, but without  excomunicating <a id="l3654"></a>one another or breaking communion by any publick act. And if they had <a id="l3655"></a>broke communion the western Churches would have been the schisma<a id="l3656"></a>ticks because  they imposed the Popes supremacy <a id="l3657"></a>upon the eastern Churches which was an unjust  condition of Communion. <a id="l3658"></a>&amp; occasioned the schism  And when the western Churches desisted from  the <a id="l3660"></a>imposition &amp; acknowledged the authority of the eastern Councils over her own <a id="l3661"></a>members,  subscribing to the  sentence of those Councils in <a id="l3662"></a>the Council of Millain they would have ceased to be schismaticks. And as <a id="l3663"></a>for the faith, the Creed published by the  eastern bishops  in their <a id="l3664"></a>return from the Council of Serdica is by Hilary (one of the hottest of the <a id="l3665"></a>homousians) allowed to be a complete &amp; absolute definition of the faith <a id="l3666"></a>And the Creed  in which the Churches of the whole Empire  (both Greeks &amp; Latines) agreed  at the Councils of Sirmium, Nice in Thrace, <a id="l3668"></a>Ariminum,  Seleucia &amp; Constantinople  is not found fault with except <a id="l3669"></a>for abolishing the use of the word usia.  Certainly if the Greek &amp; Latin Churches were in <a id="l3671"></a>communion with  one another  &amp; by consequence a member <a id="l3672"></a>of the Church Catholick before they abolished the use of this word: <a id="l3673"></a> they could not cease to be a member of the church catholick by abolishing of the use of  it,  a word <a id="l3674"></a>which is not in scripture nor received from the Apostles by tradition,  <a id="l3675"></a>a word which had been introduced by hereticks &amp; abolished  by the <a id="l3676"></a>Council of Antioch with the approbation of the Church catholick 90 <a id="l3677"></a>years before,  a word which created great disturbances  &amp; was abolished by the <a id="l3679"></a>Apostles rule of holding fast the form of sound words which they had re<a id="l3680"></a>ceived from the  beginning.</p>

<p id="par404">Hitherto the  Mystery of iniquity was to work   without prevailing against the <a id="l3682"></a>Church. ffor  it was to work without prevailing untill the man of sin should be revealed &amp; the Man of Sin was <a id="l3684"></a>not to be revealed till that which letted should be taken out of the way <a id="l3685"></a>&amp; that which letted was by the first Christians taken for the Roman Empire <a id="l3686"></a>S<sup>t</sup> Paul had told the churches what it was, but was unwilling to set it down <a id="l3687"></a>in writing least he should be taken for an enemy to the Empire. <em class="underline">Remember <a id="l3688"></a>ye not</em>, saith he, <em class="underline">that when I was with you I told you these things? <a id="l3689"></a>And now ye know what witholdeth that he</em> [the Man of sin] <em class="underline">might be <a id="l3690"></a>revealed in his time</em>. ffor the mystery of iniquity doth already work. Only <a id="l3691"></a>he who now letteth  will let untill he be taken out of the way. <a id="l3692"></a>And then shall that wicked one be revealed. That which letted was therefor <a id="l3693"></a>in being in the days of the Apostles &amp; therefore was the Roman Empire. <a id="l3694"></a>And this  is generally allowed by interpreters. Not a Christian Empire but the <a id="l3695"></a> Empire then in being, the heathen Roman Empire <a id="l3696"></a> The Man of sin was to be a <a id="l3697"></a>Christian dominion &amp; while the Empire continued heathen it was <a id="l3698"></a>impossible for a Christian dominion to rise up. It was therefore the <a id="l3699"></a>heathen Empire which letted. This Empire began to be taken out of the <a id="l3700"></a>way by the conversion of Constantine to the Christian religion &amp; his victories <a id="l3701"></a>over Maxentius &amp; Licinius: but was not fully taken out of the way before <a id="l3702"></a>the death of Iulian the last heathen Emperor. And we have shewn that <a id="l3703"></a>the mystery of iniquity  worked till his death, but without prevailing <a id="l3704"></a>In the reign of Constantius the  Bishop of Rome laboured hard for <a id="l3705"></a>the supremacy, &amp; the Western Emperor Constans with his bishops endeavoured <a id="l3706"></a>to set up this new dominion which was to be the man of sin: but  <a id="l3707"></a>their endeavours were  frustrated &amp; the Church catholick <a id="l3708"></a>continued entire till the  death of Iulian. And now that <a id="l3709"></a>which letted is taken out of the way it remains that we shew how the mystery <a id="l3710"></a>of iniquity prevailed over the Church &amp; became the man of sin  sitting <a id="l3711"></a>in the Temple of God. For the revelation of the man of Sin signifies  the victory of the mystery of iniquity  over the Church &amp;  its exaltation into the throne <a id="l3713"></a> to be worshipped as a God. And this came to pass in the manner <a id="l3714"></a>following.</p>
<p id="par405">When the Emperor Iulian was dead, his successor Iovian, as  released <a id="l3716"></a>Athanasius &amp; some other bishops,  from  banishment &amp; <a id="l3717"></a>desired an account of their faith, as Gregory Nazianzen who lived in those days thus mentions. Quinetiam fidei <a id="l3718"></a>nostræ veritatem a multis laceratam &amp; perturbatam – – – – – upon the death <a id="l3719"></a>of Athanasius A.C. 373.</p>

<p id="par407">The faith which began now to be preached was agreed upon a few <a id="l3727"></a>months before  by  letters between Athanasius &amp; Liberius <a id="l3728"></a>Bishop of Rome &amp; by a consultation of 12 or 16 banished bishops who were there with Atha<span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p164v"> &lt;164v&gt; </span>nasius. The Latines had long ago translated homousios by unius substantiæ, &amp; the <a id="l3729"></a> homousian Greeks had translated the una substantia of the Latines by una <a id="l3730"></a>usia &amp; una hypostasis. And the Latines now declaring the holy Ghost to be <a id="l3731"></a>consubstantial to the father &amp; son &amp; expressing  this faith by una substantia &amp; tres per<a id="l3732"></a>sonæ, Athanasius &amp; those with him examined the language translated it una usia &amp; tres hypostases, changing una hypos<a id="l3733"></a>tasis into tres hypostases to clear themselves from the suspicion of Sabellianism. <a id="l3734"></a>&amp; meaning by una usia &amp; tres hypostases one substance in nature &amp; kind &amp; three <a id="l3735"></a>personal substances in number. And this was the faith which Athanasius presented to <a id="l3736"></a>Iovian. It was agreed also by Athanasius &amp; those with him at Alexandria that <a id="l3737"></a>the Bishops who had subscribed in the late Councils of Sirmium, Nice – – – – <a id="l3738"></a>– – – – – – ereptus est mundus.</p>
<p id="par408">The Bishop of Rome therefore separated &amp;  by communicating with Athanasius  revived <a id="l3740"></a>his claim to appeals &amp; to strengthen himself sent letters to  the western <a id="l3741"></a>bishops  inviting them to separate &amp; <a id="l3742"></a> come over to him &amp; signifying that they should be received into his communion without <a id="l3743"></a>losing their bishopricks, &amp; in a few years he  &amp; his successor Damasus gained most of <a id="l3744"></a>the western bishops.</p>

<p id="par410">In three years he bained one half of the people of Rome. ffor upon his <a id="l3745"></a>death, which happened in November  A.C. 366 – – – – &amp; this Council sending <a id="l3746"></a>a letter to the bishops of Illyricum they met &amp; subscribed the Roman faith <a id="l3747"></a>&amp;  recommended it to the Churches of Asia &amp; Phrygia &amp; the western <a id="l3748"></a>Emperors Valentinian &amp; Gratian – – – – – – prædicare præcepit.</p>
<p id="par411">In the mean time the bishops of Alexandria &amp; Antioch endeavoured <a id="l3749"></a>to propagate the same faith in Egypt &amp; Syria &amp; were generally assisted by the <a id="l3750"></a>Moncks  in their diocesses. Yet the Greek Emperor Valens opposed the <a id="l3751"></a>homousion – – – – – – – – – – – – sine dilatione contendat.</p>
<p id="par412">And henceforward the Bishops of Rome began to give laws to the Churches by <a id="l3752"></a>their Decrees. ffor soon after this edict Himmerius – – – – – – – – ignorare sit liberum &amp;c. <a id="l3753"></a>This was the beginning of decretory Epistles.</p>

<p id="par421" class="i0"> Besides the  unity</p>
<p id="par422">You have heard that the  three persons were said to be  of one substance &amp; consubstantial <a id="l3793"></a>by reason of their similitude &amp; being of one nature essence &amp; species: but there is yet a <a id="l3794"></a>further reason. ffor as two cohering parts of one undivided stone are unius lapidis &amp; <a id="l3795"></a>unius  substantiæ &amp; cannot properly be called two stones or two substances til they are broken <a id="l3796"></a>&amp; separated from one another so the three hypostases were  conceived by many of the fourth &amp; following ages  to cohære <a id="l3797"></a> in one undivided substance &amp; for that reason to be of one substance. And <a id="l3798"></a>hence came the language of  the holy &amp; undivided Trinity. So <a id="l3799"></a>Athanasius . . . . . . their rays, &amp; others compare the Trinity to thre men with this difference <a id="l3800"></a>that men are separated from one another but the Trinity undivided. And many in the <a id="l3801"></a>Council of Serdica seemed to be of this opinion when they called it Arianism to make <a id="l3802"></a>the father son &amp; holy ghost three separated hypostases. But  its to be observed that <a id="l3803"></a>the cohesion &amp; union of the divine hypostases was not  to be conceived in a corporeal manner by jux<a id="l3804"></a>taposition &amp; cohesion of contiguous  tangible parts but by the internal cohesion of three <a id="l3805"></a>spirits which pervade one another &amp; are each of them omnipresent: which manner of <a id="l3806"></a>cohæsion &amp; conjunction the Greeks called περιχιόρησις &amp; the Latines circumincessio. For these <a id="l3807"></a> words  import a mutual penetration  &amp; pervasion of   substances every where <a id="l3808"></a>coincident &amp; present to one another.</p>

<p id="par424">You have heard that  in the times next after the Council of <a id="l3818"></a>Nice when the  language unius substantiæ &amp; unius hypostasis began to be used the <a id="l3819"></a>Greek Church accused those of Sabellianism &amp; Montanism who used it. By Sabellians they <a id="l3820"></a>meant those of the tautousian faith, by Montanists those of the homousian faith in the <a id="l3821"></a>sense of  Montanus that is those who held the father &amp; son to be <a id="l3822"></a>of one substance as parts  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p165v"> &lt;165v&gt; </span> co<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>hæ<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ring  in one undivided substance. For <a id="l3823"></a>Tertullian in his book against Praxeas in explaining &amp; defending the doctrine of Montanus <a id="l3824"></a>κατὰ Proclulum, represented that the son was  a cohering part of the father <a id="l3825"></a>born of him without separation or division of the fathers substance.  &amp; that after the <a id="l3826"></a>nativity of the son the father acted as a person in the remaining part. ffor in explaining how (according to Montanus) the son might suffer without the father, he compares the <a id="l3828"></a>son to a river which may be muddied while the fountain from whence it flows may remain <a id="l3829"></a>cleare. The Montanists therefore in comparing the father &amp; son to a fountain &amp;  a stream <a id="l3830"></a>a root &amp;  its branch, the sun &amp; its light, understood two cohering hypostases which with the <a id="l3831"></a>holy Ghost composed one undivided substance in the deity. And this doctrine  Sabellianism (which was Montanism κατὰ Æschynem being successively received by Pope Victor &amp;  <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>defended<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> by Tertullian got <a id="l3833"></a>root in the western churches &amp; spread silently   as is manifest by the character <a id="l3834"></a>which Hilary gives the bishops of Gallia &amp; Britain in his epistle  written to them as has been <a id="l3835"></a>mentioned above &amp; also by the complaint of the eastern churches that the western  was  lapsed into  the errors of Sabellius &amp; Montanus, &amp; by the approbation <a id="l3837"></a>which the Trinity of Montanus met with amongst the homousians. For Epiphanius <a id="l3838"></a>tells us<sup class="note" id="n40-ref">[40]</sup> that Montanus was of the same opinion with the catholick Church concerning <a id="l3839"></a>the  father son &amp; h.g. tho Tertullian confesses that the generality of <a id="l3840"></a>Christians in his days looked upon the Montanists as guilty of polytheism. Montanism <a id="l3841"></a>therefore after it was improved by the doctrine of eternal generation, &amp; recom<a id="l3842"></a>mended by the language of unius substantiæ prevailed in the world.</p>
<p id="par425">In the first half of the fourth century the disputes were only about the nature <a id="l3843"></a>of the son. Very little was then said about the holy Ghost. And I do not find that <a id="l3844"></a> they began to call him God openly before the reign of Iulian the Apostate. <a id="l3845"></a>In his reign Athanasius &amp; the little Council at Alexandria above mentioned declared <a id="l3846"></a> an undivided consubstantial Trinity &amp; yet but one deity, &amp; that it was Arianism to separate <a id="l3847"></a>the holy Ghost from the father &amp; son or  call him a creature. But Athanasius being soon forced <a id="l3848"></a>to fly, matters rested till the reign of Iovian. And then Athanasius presented to Iovian <a id="l3849"></a>the Nicene faith with a  profession of the Deity &amp; worship of the holy ghost added to it. For <a id="l3850"></a> the Nicene fathers, saith he, that the son should not be beleived only like God but true God of God, did not only say that the <a id="l3851"></a>son was like the father, [   that he should not be beleived only like God,  <a id="l3852"></a>but true God of God:] but they wrote him ὁμοούσιος  which is proper to <a id="l3853"></a> a genuine &amp; true son of a true &amp; natural father. Neither did they  <a id="l3854"></a>alienate the holy Ghost from the father &amp; the son but rather glorified him <a id="l3855"></a>with the father &amp; son in one faith of the holy Trinity, because in the holy <a id="l3856"></a>trinity there is one deity. [Thus did Athanasius  endeavour to fasten  his own opinions  upon the Nicene Council by way of consequence: whereas <a id="l3858"></a>the Council expresly cautioned that ὁμοούσιος should not be  understood in any <a id="l3859"></a>corporeal sence  nor signify any thing more then like according <a id="l3860"></a>to substance; &amp; by consequence not be illustrated by corporeal similitudes, such as are <a id="l3861"></a>those of a bodily father &amp; son, a fountain &amp; its stream, a root &amp; its branch,  <a id="l3862"></a>a sun &amp; its ray, so as to make any inference from these similitudes beyond what <a id="l3863"></a> the Council allowed. ffor these were the similitudes by which the <a id="l3864"></a> Gnosticks &amp; Montanists supported their doctrine of Æons, &amp; therefore are not <a id="l3865"></a>to be applied to the actions of God the father without great caution. Neither did] <a id="l3866"></a>But certainly the Council of Nice did not establish or declare any thing about the procession, consubstantiality <a id="l3867"></a>Deity or worship of the holy Ghost.  Nor do I meet with any disputes about his  Deity &amp; worship before the reign of Iulian the Apostate &amp; Iovian And I find Basil <a id="l3870"></a>&amp; Gregory Nazianzen who lived in those  days to be of the same opinion. <a id="l3871"></a> For  Basil  <a id="l3872"></a> writes thus. The confession of faith which the Nicene fathers composed I <a id="l3873"></a>prefer to all the confessions which were afterwards invented, in which the son is <a id="l3874"></a>confessed consubstantial to the father. –––– But because the quæstion which νὺν  ακύναν at <a id="l3875"></a>this present time is started   by those who are always  labouring to <a id="l3876"></a>innovate,  being passed over in silence by those of the former age because it <a id="l3877"></a>was not denied, was left indiscussed, I mean the question concerning the holy <a id="l3878"></a>ghost; we must add the explication of this also  according to the meaning of <a id="l3879"></a>the holy scripture : namely that we beleive accordingly as we are baptized, &amp; give glory <a id="l3880"></a>as we beleive. And therefore because baptism was instituted by our saviour in <a id="l3881"></a>the name of the father &amp; son &amp; holy ghost, we exhibit a confession of faith  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p166r"> &lt;166r&gt; </span> <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>according<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> to baptism &amp; a doxology according to the faith, glorifying the holy ghost with <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>the<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l3882"></a>father &amp; son.   Here Basil tells us the time when <a id="l3885"></a>the controversy about the Deity of the holy ghost began &amp; the fundamental argument <a id="l3886"></a>upon which this Deity was founded &amp; the ancient doxology changed.  <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>And as<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> the ancient <a id="l3887"></a>Creed was in one God, the father almighty maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp; in one Lord <a id="l3888"></a>Iesus Christ the son of God who was crucified for us, &amp; in the holy Ghost  &amp; this  faith was taught <a id="l3889"></a>to the new converted Christians in catechizing them before baptism that they might know who were <a id="l3890"></a>the father &amp; son &amp; holy ghost in whose names they were to be baptized: so it is <a id="l3891"></a>to be understood that when the primitive Christians  were <a id="l3892"></a>baptized in the name of the father &amp; son &amp; holy ghost they were baptized  not in the name of one God the father son &amp; holy ghost <a id="l3894"></a>but in the name of one God the father almighty the maker of heaven &amp; earth &amp; <a id="l3895"></a>of one Lord Iesus Christ the son of God who was crucified for us &amp; in the name <a id="l3896"></a>of the holy ghost. </p>
<p id="par426"> And the <a id="l3906"></a>primitive doxology was suited to the Creed.</p>
<p id="par427">The time when the controversy about the deity of the holy Ghost began  is told <a id="l3907"></a>us also by Gregory Nazianzen, &amp; who began it. Iovian, saith he,</p>

He should have said on the contrary: We <a id="l3909"></a>are baptized as we beleive. ffor the primitive Christians were Catechised before <a id="l3910"></a>baptism that when they came to be baptized they might understand who were <a id="l3911"></a>the father son &amp; h.g. in whose name they were baptized.

For There is one God <a id="l3931"></a>&amp; one mediator between God &amp; man  the man Christ Iesus, but there is no <a id="l3932"></a>mediator between the h.g. &amp; man nor between the Trinity &amp; man, no mediator <a id="l3933"></a>in whose name we may invoke any other God then the father.

In that day saith Christ ye shall ask me <a id="l3935"></a>nothing,  Whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will do it <a id="l3936"></a>for you. This was the primitive faith, the primitive baptism &amp; the primitive worship <a id="l3937"></a>&amp;  is of divine authority &amp; sufficient to salvation.

Now by all this it may be understood that the <a id="l3972"></a>western Churches  used the language of one <a id="l3973"></a>hypostasis from  the first beginning of their contention with the <a id="l3974"></a>Greeks about Marcellus  &amp; others, till the reign of Theodosius the great, &amp; <a id="l3975"></a>were all this time accounted Sabellians &amp; Montanists by the Greeks, <a id="l3976"></a>notwithstanding the endeavour of Athanasius to reconcile them.  <a id="l3977"></a>The language of three hypostases  suited not with that of  <a id="l3978"></a> una substantia.

And the Vandals &amp; Alans had seats granted <a id="l4027"></a>them in Pannonia &amp; the Burgundians who bordered upon Dacia <a id="l4028"></a>westward fled to the Rhene  to the number of 80000.</p>

From which conquests some compared <a id="l4036"></a>him to Alexander the great.  About four years before his death 80000 Burgundians fled from the Goths &amp; seated themselves upon the Rhene. The  Gepides, Vandals &amp; Alans <a id="l4037"></a> were Gothic nations &amp; spake the same language with the <a id="l4038"></a>Goths &amp; agreed with them in manners.

Ermaneric reigned long  <a id="l4040"></a>being 110 years old when he died.  A little before his death <a id="l4041"></a>the Hunns made war upon him &amp; at his death brake into his kingdom <a id="l4042"></a>&amp; ruined it, subduing part of his people &amp; putting the rest to flight.

He invented the Gothick <a id="l4057"></a>or sclavonian letters &amp; translated the scriptures into the language of the Goths, &amp; promoted the Christian <a id="l4058"></a>religion much among the Goths of both nations whereupon Athanaricus king of the Ostrogoths raised a persecution against <a id="l4061"></a>the Christians fearing least it should prevail in his kingdom as it had newly done amongst the Visigoths.</p>

<p id="par450" class="i0">– who although he shal openly teach a difference of persons yet  <a id="l4122"></a>shall therewith  understand   Sabellius  who said   that there <a id="l4123"></a>is one God in hypostasis, but who in scripture  takes upon him various persons <a id="l4124"></a>according to the property &amp; exigence of the subject: &amp; sometimes takes upon <a id="l4125"></a> him the speeches of the father when it is seasonable to put on his person, &amp; sometimes <a id="l4126"></a>the speeches  proper to the son when he is to descend for taking care of us  or for other <a id="l4127"></a>oeconomical operations, &amp; sometimes puts on the person of the holy Ghost when <a id="l4128"></a>the time requires speeches agreeable to this person.

<p id="par457"> The Bishop of Rome in the end of the second century or beginning of <a id="l4163"></a>the third became first a Cataphrygian &amp; then a Praxean as Tertullian in the beginning of his book against Praxeas relates &amp; by consequence was of <a id="l4164"></a>opinion that the Word of God was the λογὸς ἐνδιάθετος of the father from <a id="l4165"></a>all eternity &amp;  at length was emitted outwardly as a ray of light from the sun &amp; as the first word which god spake <a id="l4167"></a>when he began to exert his power for creating the world,  For this was the common opinion of both those here<a id="l4169"></a>ticks. </p>
<p id="par458">The Church of Rome in the days of  Pope Victor began to <a id="l4170"></a>place religion in ceremonies &amp; to  err in the faith. ffor this Pope <a id="l4171"></a>excommunicated – – – – – – – –  He seems to have written <a id="l4172"></a>letters of peace to the Montanists of Asia &amp; Phrygia for strengthning himself <a id="l4173"></a>against the true Churchs of  those parts whom he had newly ex<a id="l4174"></a>communicated in order to subvert them. And henceforward there  remained a perpetual misunderstanding between the Churches of Asia represented <a id="l4176"></a>in the Apocalyps by the seven  Churches &amp; the Church of Rome <a id="l4177"></a>represented (after  separation from the seven Churches) by the woman seated upon seven hills in the wilderness. Now while the Bishop of <a id="l4178"></a>Rome became first a Cataphrygian &amp; then a Praxean he was certainly of <a id="l4179"></a> opinion that the Word of God was the λογὸς ἐνδιάθετος of the father <a id="l4180"></a>from all eternity &amp; at length was emitted outwardly as a ray of light <a id="l4181"></a>from the Sun &amp; as the first Word which God spake when he began to <a id="l4182"></a>exert his power for creating the world. For this was the common opinion <a id="l4183"></a>of both those hereticks. [It was also their common opinion that the father &amp; <a id="l4184"></a>son were unius substantiæ, tho they differed in their manner of explaining <a id="l4185"></a>this opinion.]</p>
<p id="par459">By these instances it is manifest that  the metaphysical <a id="l4186"></a>theology of Orpheus Plato &amp; other heathen Philosophers began to spred much in the <a id="l4187"></a>Churches before the end of the second century  school of Alexan<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>dria<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; infected not only those who <a id="l4188"></a>separated &amp; became hereticks of note, but also many others who did not <a id="l4189"></a>separate &amp; particularly that it insinuated it self into the Churches of Antioch &amp; Rome &amp; the <a id="l4190"></a>school at Alexandria. And therefore we need not wonder if it still got <a id="l4191"></a>ground in the third century &amp; prevailed in the fourth.

<p id="par460" class="i0">X Antony the father of the Moncks  (as Athanasius tells us) taught the people that the son of God <a id="l4193"></a>was  αιδιος της του πατρὸς ὀυσίας <a id="l4195"></a>λόγος καὶ σοφία,  the word &amp; wisdome of the fathers substance <a id="l4196"></a> &amp; therefore eternal.

<p id="par466">But these opinions were only prvate ones not yet imposed upon Christians <a id="l4214"></a> the article of faith that Christ</p>
<p id="par467">Now according to the  opinion of these Christians mentioned by Iustin <a id="l4215"></a>the Son or word of God  was  the internal λογὸς or λογος ενδιαθετος of the father  from all eternity &amp;  emitted from him outwardly as light from the sun  <a id="l4217"></a>before the beginning of the world in order to create it &amp; this  metaphysical theology  tho it came from the <span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>hea<span class="nb-n">}</span></span><a id="l4219"></a>thens &amp; was  the theology of the  Cataphrygians yet it spread very  quickly in the Churches so as to infect several <a id="l4220"></a>Christians of Good note before the end of the second century. For Athena<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>goras<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l4221"></a>in his Apology after he had been describing the opinion of Plato concerning the <a id="l4222"></a>Deity subjoyns.

<p id="par468">Arius &amp; those with him in their Epistle sent to Alexander  in the beginning of the controversy  wrote thus. <em class="underline">The Son is not <a id="l4225"></a>a being which first existed &amp; was afterwards begotten or formed into a <a id="l4226"></a>son;  for you your self, o blessed father, in the middle of the Church <a id="l4227"></a>&amp; in the  session</em> [of the Presbytery] <em class="underline">have often confuted them who <a id="l4228"></a>affirmed these things</em>.  And a little after: <em class="underline">But if this,  I came out from <a id="l4231"></a>him &amp; out of the womb, &amp; out  from the Father , be understood by <a id="l4232"></a>some as a consubstantial part or an emission: the father will be compound <a id="l4233"></a>&amp; divisible &amp; mutable &amp; also a body according to those men, &amp; so far as they <a id="l4234"></a>can effect, the incorporeal father will suffer those things which are proper to <a id="l4235"></a>bodies</em>. By these words of the Arians I conclude that  both parties agreed <a id="l4236"></a>that the son was begotten before the creation  but disputed whether he existed &amp; was <a id="l4237"></a>in the father before he was begotten  &amp; formed into a son some denying it with Arius, &amp; others affirming it: And therefore  the council of Nice in <a id="l4238"></a>anathematizing those who should  say that <em class="underline">before the son was be<a id="l4239"></a>gotten  he was  not</em>, confirmed the contrary opinion of those who maintained that <a id="l4240"></a>the  son was in the father from all eternity as his inherent &amp; essentiall Word &amp; wisdom &amp; at length came out of him <a id="l4241"></a> by a metaphysical emission for creating the world &amp; called this coming <a id="l4242"></a>out  from the father the nativity or generation of the Son. And therefore the <a id="l4243"></a>  article of  their Creed that the son was begotten of the father before all <a id="l4244"></a>worlds , that is of the substance of the father God of God light of light, very God of very God begotten not made, is to be  understood not an <a id="l4245"></a>eternal generation but of  a single act of generation whereby at once  the son came out of the father  for <a id="l4246"></a>creating the world,  after he had been in the father from all <a id="l4247"></a>eternity. And in the same sense I conceive that  this article of <a id="l4248"></a> Christs being begotten  <a id="l4251"></a>before all ages was inserted into the Creed of Eusebius &amp; some other <a id="l4252"></a>Creeds of the Greeks in  the times of the  third century. It was first inserted into the expositions &amp; paraphrases of the Creed &amp; came thence into the body of it  For <a id="l4253"></a>in this sense Tertullian   neare the beginning of that century inserted it into one of <a id="l4254"></a>his  paraphrastical Creeds in these words.

<p id="par470">To shew that the Iewish religion  is one &amp; the same with the Christian <a id="l4260"></a>it may be further observed that the various names given to Christ have <a id="l4261"></a>generally a relation to the old testament to signify that he was there spoken <a id="l4262"></a>of. He is called <em class="underline">the son of man</em> to signify that he – – – – – – – – – desired <a id="l4263"></a>Samuel to make them a king after the manner of other nations. And <a id="l4264"></a>after this Angel was rejected from being their king he came to them in the <a id="l4265"></a>form of a servant. For the Word was made flesh, that is his body – – – – – – – <a id="l4266"></a>– – – – – &amp; desired a temporal king.</p>
<p id="par471" class="i0">He was received up into heaven &amp; sat on the right hand of God Mar 16.19. Ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of the power &amp; coming in the clouds of heaven Mar. 14.62. Luc. 22.69.</p>
<p id="par472">For understanding the Law &amp; the Prophets with relation to the promised <a id="l4267"></a>Messiah, it may be further observed that the various names – – – – – temporal <a id="l4268"></a>king.<br><br></p>

<p id="par473">The  Iews therefore who beleived in the Messiah looked upon <a id="l4269"></a>themselves as not released from the law by that beleif, &amp;  as many of them as understood the calling of the Gentiles by Peters vision  looked <a id="l4271"></a>upon the  converted Gentiles as proselites of the Iews whom  God had cleansed but not obliged to enter into <a id="l4272"></a>the covenant of  the law by circumcision. And the converted gentiles were <a id="l4273"></a>of the same opinion concerning  themselves &amp; the Iews  during the two first centuries.  And therefore the <a id="l4274"></a>Christian religion was not a new one.  nor do the Iews offend in keeping the law but the churches of the Gentiles  were a branch of a wild Olive grafted into the stock <a id="l4276"></a>of the Iews,  &amp;  were not to boast themselves against <a id="l4277"></a>the natural branches. Rom. 11.17. The law was good &amp; the Iews  transgressed not in keeping the ceremonial part of it but in laying the stress of religion <a id="l4279"></a>upon this  part &amp; neglecting the fundamental part  of it, such as was <a id="l4280"></a>to love God with all their heart &amp; soul, &amp; their neighbours as themselves, to be just <a id="l4281"></a> friendly &amp; merciful  to all men &amp;  temperate meek &amp; humble in <a id="l4282"></a>themselves &amp; content with their present condition. These things they ought to have <a id="l4283"></a>done &amp; not to have left the ceremonial part of the law undone. But while they <a id="l4284"></a>were hurried on with ambitious &amp; covetous desires of honour &amp; glory &amp; riches in this world &amp; could think <a id="l4285"></a>of no other Messiah then a temporal  king  who should  exalt the Iews in  honour &amp; glory &amp; dominion  by con<a id="l4287"></a>quering all the nations round about : God made use of this their ambition &amp; cove<a id="l4288"></a>tousness to blind their eyes  so that they should not understand the prophesies concerning <a id="l4289"></a> the Messiah nor know him when he came, but crucify him &amp; set up fals Christs against <a id="l4290"></a>the Romans to  their own destruction. And by this means God has <a id="l4291"></a>rejected them from being his people or kingdom &amp; dispersed them into all nations as at this <a id="l4292"></a>day,  so that at present they are no people or body politique but a scatered <a id="l4293"></a> servile generation of men without any government of their own &amp; yet in a wonderfull manner continue numerous &amp; distinct from all other nations: which cannot be said of any other captivated  nation what ever, <a id="l4294"></a>&amp; therefore the work of providence. ffor God is able to turn away unrighte<a id="l4295"></a>ousness from Iacob,  &amp; graft the natural branches again into their own root.</p>
<p id="par474">Now  for enlightning the Iews both at the first preaching of the gospel &amp; hereafter whenever it shall please God to have mercy <a id="l4297"></a>upon  that scattered nation there have been many names given to  Iesus Christ with relation <a id="l4298"></a>to the old testament for explaining Moses &amp; the Prophets. He is called the son of <a id="l4299"></a>man to signify that he  – – – – – – – – &amp; desired a temporal king.</p>
<p id="par475"> This Angel therefore governed Israel in the days of Moses &amp; the <a id="l4300"></a>judges untill they rejected him from being their King &amp; desired Samuel to make <a id="l4301"></a>them a king after the manner of other nations.  After which he sent his messen<a id="l4302"></a>ger the holy spirit to the Prophets for a time &amp; at length came to the Iews himself  <a id="l4303"></a> in the form of a servant.  And in relation <a id="l4304"></a>to his being called an Angel or Messenger in the old testament, he is now said in <a id="l4305"></a>the new to  be sent from his father &amp; to come down from  heaven &amp; from God.</p>
<p id="par476">This coming the Apostle Iohn describes by saying that the word was made <a id="l4306"></a>flesh, that Word which was in the beginning with God &amp; appeared to Adam Noah &amp; the <a id="l4307"></a>Patriarchs &amp; wrastled with Iacob became flesh.</p>

<p id="par488">The Christians of the second &amp; third centuries who held that the <a id="l4409"></a>λόγος of Iohn was the λόγος ενδιάθετος of the father, taught that this <a id="l4410"></a>λόγος  a little before the creation of the world <a id="l4411"></a>was emitted outwardly  as a voice from a man, as a ray of light from the <a id="l4412"></a>Sun, a river from the fountain, or a branch from the root  &amp; called this <a id="l4413"></a>emission the generation of the son &amp;  said that God emitted him in order to create <a id="l4415"></a>the world.

The letter is extant in Hilaries frag<a id="l4454"></a>ments &amp; there is not one word in it about the  deity <a id="l4455"></a>of the holy Ghost.

And therefore the controversy <a id="l4462"></a>about the deity of the holy Ghost was not yet begun in Italy. <a id="l4463"></a>Athanasius had proposed it to the Emperor Iovian &amp; had some follow<a id="l4464"></a>ers: but they were but few as you have heard out of Gregory <a id="l4465"></a>Nazianzen, &amp; the Emperor Valens was against them &amp; forced them <a id="l4466"></a>to be silent in this point upon pain of losing their bishopricks. The <a id="l4467"></a>western Churches had liberty of speech, but I do not find that they <a id="l4468"></a>contended for the deity of the holy Ghost before the year 373 &amp; therefor <a id="l4469"></a>reccon that the year in which this controversy began in the west. After the councils <a id="l4470"></a>of Sirmium Nicea, Ariminum Seleucia &amp; Constantinople had rejected the <a id="l4471"></a>use of the word usia with its compounds in relation  to the Son, the first work was to restore the use <a id="l4472"></a>of those words  &amp; the authority of the Council of Nice &amp; <a id="l4473"></a>when this point was gained <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from the right margin of f 175v &gt; </span> sometime after by Dorotheus the Presbyter <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 175v resumes &gt; </span>, the next <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p175r"> &lt;175r&gt; </span> step was to extend this doctrine to the holy Ghost.</p>
<p id="par494" class="i10">For after</p>
<p id="par495"> Thereupon Macedonius who had hitherto been  <a id="l4474"></a>against the  Nicene decree declared for it  in the sense of the word ὁμοιούσιος, &amp; had many followers, this <a id="l4476"></a>being the sence in which the greek church had understood the Nicene  faith: <a id="l4477"></a>for, said the Macedonians, the western churches  vitiated the homo<a id="l4478"></a>usios; &amp; Ætius in the east  coined  a new  language: introduced <a id="l4479"></a>τὸ κατ ὀυσιαν ἀνόμοιον unlike according to substance. And both <a id="l4480"></a>opinions were wicked. For these [the western] rashly connected the dis<a id="l4481"></a>tinct hypostases of the father &amp; son into  unity <a id="l4482"></a>binding them together  with the word ὁμοούσιος as with a bond of <a id="l4483"></a>inequity: &amp; he wholy disjoyned the conjunction of the nature of the son with <a id="l4484"></a> the father by introducing the name of unlike according to <a id="l4485"></a>substance.

<p id="par499" class="i0">And yet Liberius &amp; the western Bishops in the answer which they wrote back to those eastern <a id="l4500"></a>bishops by their Legates acknowledged the agreement of their faith <a id="l4501"></a>with the faith of the  churches of Italy &amp; the west, &amp; call them <a id="l4502"></a>beloved brethren &amp; fellow ministers. </p>
<p id="par500">The Council of Constantinople A.C. 360 had for various crimes deposed Macedonius <a id="l4503"></a>bishop of Constantinople Eustathius of Sebastia Eleusius of Cyricum Cyril of Ierusalem  Sophronius of Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia, <a id="l4505"></a>Dracontius of Pergamus, Neonas of Seleucia where a council had met. <a id="l4506"></a>Thereupon Macedonius Eustathius Eleusius &amp; some others declared for the <a id="l4507"></a>Nicene faith  &amp; that  homousios   should be taken in the same sense with homoiusios like the father <a id="l4509"></a>according to substance. And in the reign of Iovian  some of them <a id="l4510"></a>meeting in a Council at  Antioch with Meletius one of the bishops of that city &amp; with Eusebius <a id="l4511"></a>of Samosat,  Acacius of Cæsarea, Titus of Bostra &amp; their friends, presented <a id="l4512"></a>a profession of this faith to the Emperor Iovian.

<p id="par501">The Christian Iews  in the Church of Ierusalem under Iames being <a id="l4519"></a>dispersed by the siege of that city &amp; flying in great numbers to  Pella, bey<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ond<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l4520"></a>Iordan, became the Nazarenes &amp; the Ebionites. ffor they were called Naza<a id="l4521"></a>renes before that flight &amp; Ebionites from their poverty. They received only <a id="l4522"></a>the Gospel of  Matthew in hebrew &amp; for the most part beleived Christ <a id="l4523"></a>to be a mere man without framing to themselves any opinions about the <a id="l4524"></a>λόγος ffor the Gospel of Iohn was not yet written. The Ebionites  were such as the Apostle <a id="l4525"></a>Paul reprehends for imposing the law upon the Gentiles. They communicated <a id="l4526"></a>with the Christian Iews but in respect of the Christian Gentiles were schis<a id="l4527"></a>maticks. The Nazarenes or some of them communicated  with the Christi<a id="l4528"></a>an Gentiles &amp; continued in that communion  till about the end of the second <a id="l4529"></a>century as has been explained above.  And so did the Christian gentiles after<a id="l4530"></a>wards called Alogi. These held that Christ was a mere man &amp;  received <a id="l4531"></a>not the writings of Iohn in which he is called the λόγος. For it was long <a id="l4532"></a>before all the writings of the new Testament were generally received. <a id="l4533"></a> Iustin Martyr gives us this account of the communion of the Alogi in his <a id="l4534"></a>days. Verum enim vero, Trypho, dixi . . . . . . . . . . . . . sententia sunt, dixerunt. <a id="l4535"></a>After the death of Iustin arose the  Encratites &amp; Montanists <a id="l4536"></a>&amp; after them the  Tessarescædecatites &amp;  after them the Alogi according to Epiphanius. When the  Tessarescædecatites  &amp; Alogi  began to be accounted  hereticks then their heresies <a id="l4539"></a>are said to  begin  that is, the heresy of the <a id="l4540"></a>Tessarescædecatites in the days of Pope Victor who condemned it &amp; the heresy <a id="l4541"></a>of the Alogi in the latter end of his days or in the days of his successor <a id="l4542"></a>Zepharine. But I do not find that the Alogi were condemned in any Councils <a id="l4543"></a>or that they were distinguished from other Christians by any particular name   before Epipha<a id="l4544"></a>nius gave them the name of Alogi. When Theodotus the currier of Byzantium <a id="l4545"></a>was condemned by Pope Victor for holding Christ to be a mere man &amp; soon <a id="l4546"></a>after (I think in the days of Pope Zepherine) Artemon the master of <a id="l4547"></a>Theodotus was condemned by the Greeks for the  like error: their disciples <a id="l4548"></a>alledged that their opinion was taught by the Apostles &amp; ancient <a id="l4549"></a>Christians &amp; the truth of the doctrine conserved to the days of Pope Victor <a id="l4550"></a>but from the days of his successor Zepherine [inclusively] was adulterated. About this <a id="l4551"></a>time therefore the Nazarenes &amp; Alogi were excluded communion by the condemnation of Theodotus &amp; Artemon. But yet <a id="l4552"></a> Artemon   held Christ to be a mere man <a id="l4553"></a>in  a different sense from that of the Nazarenes &amp; Alogi,  teaching with <a id="l4557"></a>Paul of Samosat, Marcellus &amp; Photinus that Christ was a man inha<a id="l4558"></a>bited by the λόγος</p>
<p id="par502">For the Gnosticks &amp; such like hereticks thinking it below the dignity of their <a id="l4559"></a>principal Gods &amp;c.</p>

<p id="par503" class="i0">The opinions of the Tesseracædecatites &amp; Alogi were much older, but its <a id="l4560"></a>to be understood that when  they were first  <a id="l4561"></a>condemned; then Epiphanius reccons that their heresies began. The Tesseracædecatites <a id="l4562"></a>were first condemned by Pope Victor &amp; therefore the  heresy of the Alogi was recconed  to begin  in the latter end of the days of <a id="l4564"></a>Victor or in the days of his successor Zepherine.</p>

<p id="par504">These sences  he rejects &amp; tells them that the <a id="l4565"></a>father &amp; son were two like &amp; equal substances of one nature &amp; kind from all eternity; two in number &amp; one in <a id="l4566"></a>nature &amp; kind, &amp; that the son was notwithstanding obedient to the father as his author. He <a id="l4567"></a>did  not by rapine equalize himself  to the father but was obedient to him even unto death.

<p id="par505" class="i0">the λόγος might be. Before the days of Alexander some might say <a id="l4573"></a>that the Word was always with the father  but I do not meet with any before Alexander <a id="l4580"></a>who said that he was always begotten. And I am the more inclined to <a id="l4581"></a>beleive  Alexander  the author of this opinion because his enemies <a id="l4582"></a>objected that  according to this opinion <a id="l4583"></a>the son was ἀγένητος unbegotten &amp;  that they never <a id="l4584"></a>heard of two unbegotten principles before. They looked upon Alexander therefore <a id="l4585"></a>as the first author of this opinion: &amp; if the opinion had been older the <a id="l4586"></a>objection would also have been older. According to Iohn the Word was in <a id="l4587"></a>the beginning with God, &amp; the Son was begotten &amp; born when the Word became flesh. According to he was born of a Virgin &amp; at the age of 30 years baptized &amp; declared to be the son of God. According to the <a id="l4588"></a>Christian Philosophers of the second &amp; third century the son of God was begotten a little before <a id="l4589"></a>the beginning of the World in order to  its creation.  According to Alexander he <a id="l4590"></a>was begotten from all eternity. And according to Arius he was begotten of <a id="l4591"></a>nothing before all  ages.</p>
<p id="par506">Hosius who presided in the Council of Nice &amp; published the Nicene Creed, <a id="l4592"></a>&amp; by consequence – – – – – – – – – – et ffilius est filius Patris. From whence <a id="l4593"></a>it is manifest that the opinion of one hypostasis of the father son &amp; holy <a id="l4594"></a>Ghost was now much spread in the  west. And since Hosius was <a id="l4595"></a>at the head of this Council it may be concluded that he was of this opini<a id="l4596"></a>on &amp; therefore in publishing the  Nicene creed translated ὁμοούσιος by <a id="l4597"></a>unius substantiæ &amp; unius hypostaseos.</p>
<p id="par507">About twelve years after the meeting of this Council Hilary being <a id="l4598"></a>then in the east &amp;  sending to the bishops of Gallia &amp; Britain an <a id="l4599"></a>account of the condemnation of Photinus by the Council of Sirmium &amp; <a id="l4600"></a>of the faith &amp; decrees of the Council against him  with his expositions <a id="l4601"></a>upon them as was mentioned above &amp; doing this to set them right in <a id="l4602"></a>the faith, he  tells them that many of them <a id="l4603"></a>understood the language of una substantia in the sense of the hereticks <a id="l4604"></a>Multi ex nobis fratres Charissimi, saith he, ita unam substantiam Patris <a id="l4605"></a>et filij prædicant – – – – – – – – – – – – – &amp; that more fully then in the Creed.</p>
<p id="par508">The Greeks therefore for checking &amp; abolishing the monousian faith which <a id="l4606"></a>by the language  of una  substantia una usia  &amp; una <a id="l4607"></a>hypostasis had been spread in the west &amp; in Egypt, &amp; was contrary to the Nicene <a id="l4608"></a>faith &amp; by the eastern churches accounted Sabellianism &amp; Paulinianism en<a id="l4609"></a>deavoured in  several Councils A.C. 357, 358, 359 &amp; 360 to abolish <a id="l4610"></a>that language &amp; revive the decree of the Council of Antioch against <a id="l4611"></a>Paul. And particularly in the Council of Constantinople A.C. 360 they <a id="l4612"></a>decreed that the word <em class="underline">hypostasis</em> or (as Theoderet writes) <em class="underline">one hypostasis</em> should <a id="l4613"></a>not be named of the father son &amp; holy ghost.</p>
<p id="par509">The Greeks therefore used the language of three hypostases <a id="l4614"></a>but many of the Latines continued to use the language of one &amp; accused <a id="l4615"></a>the Greeks of Arianism &amp; were mutually accused of Sabellianism <a id="l4616"></a>by the Greeks. And this was the state of things in the end of the <a id="l4617"></a>reign of the Emperor Constantius, A.C. 361.</p>
<p id="par510">The next year Athanasius – – – – – cannot be disputed.</p>
<p id="par511">Yet it was some years before the language of one hypostasis <a id="l4618"></a> fully ceased among the Latines – – – – – – – – – – – tres substantias <a id="l4619"></a>prædicabit? However, the Latines in a little time for avoiding the imputation of Sabellianism quitted this language <a id="l4620"></a> &amp; came into the opinion of Athanasius &amp; Hilary that the father <a id="l4621"></a>son &amp; holy Ghost were three substances in number &amp; one in nature &amp; species</p>
<span class="pagenumber"> &lt; insertion from the left margin of f 176v &gt; </span>
<p id="par512">And further to free themselves from  the imputation of Sabellianism  &amp; Paulinianism of which they had been accused, they anathema<a id="l4622"></a>tized those heresies. And now the language of  una substantia &amp; una  usia being no longer Sabellian nor contrary to the Nicene faith <a id="l4623"></a>became defensible as if it had been erroneously abolished by the late Councils, &amp; the language of three hypostases</p>

<p id="par513">And hence forward the language of one  hypostasis began to cease. <a id="l4624"></a>ffor  in the reign of Iulian  A.C.. 362.

For in the letter . . . . . prædicabit.</p>
<p id="par514">The Council of Nice took hypostasis in the same sense with usia: for in the <a id="l4635"></a>anathemas annexed  to their Creed they say</p>
<p id="par515">During this controversy the Latines began to use the language of three <a id="l4636"></a> persons to that of one substance &amp; </p>
<p id="par516">Instead of calling the father son &amp; holy Ghost three hypostases the Latines called <a id="l4637"></a>three persons.</p>
<p id="par517">The Council of Antioch A.C. 344  or 345  in a long declaration <a id="l4638"></a>of their faith which they sent to the Latines  anathematized them who should <a id="l4639"></a> say that the father son &amp; holy ghost were one  thing &amp; <a id="l4640"></a>one person &amp; declared that they were three &amp; the council of Sirmium <a id="l4641"></a>which condemned Photinus A.C. 351  repeated the anathema. This was done in opposition <a id="l4643"></a>to Sabellianism which was then spreading in the west. And hence I seem <a id="l4644"></a>to gather that the language of three persons as well as that of one substance <a id="l4645"></a>was already begun  amongst the Latines. But the word person being <a id="l4646"></a>of an ambiguous signification, The Greeks to make it signify a substance &amp; not only a power  or form of a substance used the language of τρια πραγ<a id="l4647"></a>ματα &amp;  τρεις ὑποστάσεις three things &amp; three hypostases as well as that of τρία πρόσοπα three persons  And hence arose that <a id="l4649"></a>controversy about words which Athanasius composed in the little Council of Alexan<a id="l4650"></a>dria above mentioned, &amp; of which  Gregory Nazianzen in  his Oration <a id="l4651"></a>upon Athanasius gives this account. <br><br></p>
<p id="par518">Before the times of this Council of Alexandria I do not find that the <a id="l4652"></a>holy Ghost began to be called God or to be worshipped as God in conjunction with the father <a id="l4653"></a>&amp; the Son. In the  primitive Creed we are taught to beleive in <em class="underline">one <a id="l4654"></a>God</em> the father &amp; in <em class="underline">one Lord</em> Iesus Christ the son &amp; in the holy Ghost &amp; this we are taught in order to be <a id="l4655"></a>baptized in their names, &amp; therefore the primitive  Christians were baptized <a id="l4656"></a>in the name of <em class="underline">one God</em> the father &amp; of <em class="underline">one Lord</em> Iesus Christ the son &amp; of one <a id="l4657"></a>holy Ghost: but now men began to be baptized in the name of  <a id="l4658"></a>the father son &amp; holy ghost one God. And this faith &amp; baptism was set on foot <a id="l4659"></a>at the same time with Saint-worship &amp; by the same men. For Athana<a id="l4660"></a>sius &amp; the other bishops in the aforesaid Council of Alexandria declared one Deity <a id="l4661"></a>of the father son &amp; h. Ghost &amp; about two years after (viz<sup>t</sup> AC. 364) Athanasius published this doctrine <a id="l4662"></a>to the Emperor Iovian.</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p177v"> &lt;177v&gt; </span>



<p id="par522">And the Council of Serdica composed of about 200 Western &amp; Egyptian bishops A.C. 347,  in their <a id="l4665"></a>general epistle as it is recited by Sozomen say: Confitemur filium esse virtutem <a id="l4666"></a>Patris. Confitemur illum esse τὸν λογον Verbum Dei Patris præter quod nullum est aliud <a id="l4667"></a>et Verbum verum Deum et sapientiam ac virtutem esse. Venem autem filium <a id="l4668"></a>esse tradimus non sicut alij filij  appellantur: nam hi quidem aut regenerationis <a id="l4669"></a>causa Dij dicuntur, aut eo quod digni habiti fuerint Filij noncipantur non <a id="l4670"></a>autem ob unam hypostasim quæ est Patris et Filij.  And this Epistle was handed <a id="l4671"></a>about in the Churches till the reign of Iulian the Apostate as  composed <a id="l4672"></a>by the Council of Serdica &amp; therefore the profession of faith conteined therein had <a id="l4673"></a>many followers in those days.</p>
<p id="par523">So then the opinion that the Word of God was the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος of the father <a id="l4674"></a> tho it had its rise among the Gnosticks &amp; sprang from the  <a id="l4675"></a>philosophy of the heathens &amp; Cabalists yet after it was refined by the Montanists &amp; Patripassians <a id="l4676"></a>&amp; was taught by some other Christians of good note who had been educated in the philosophy of the heathens &amp; backt by the text of Solomon Dominus creavit me initio  viarum suarum ad opera sua: it spread <a id="l4677"></a>in the Churches  in the second &amp; third centuries &amp;  got ground very much in the <a id="l4678"></a>fourth century  untill it was condemned in Photinus by <a id="l4679"></a>the Council of Sirmium A.C. 351 [&amp; the sentences of the Council against him <a id="l4680"></a>were made known in all the churches]  from which time it decreased &amp; in a few years vanished, <a id="l4681"></a>the faith &amp; sentences of that Council  against Photinus meeting with an <a id="l4682"></a>universal reception &amp; approbation. And so far as I can find even Athanasius <a id="l4683"></a>himself rejected that opinion. ffor in the Creed which is  extant in his works &amp; called his <a id="l4684"></a>exposition of faith, he affirms that the father son &amp; holy Ghost are three <a id="l4685"></a>hypostases &amp; declares against the sons being the λόγος ἐνδιαθετος ἢ προφο<a id="l4686"></a>ρικὸς.</p>
<p id="par524">For it is to be understood that those Christians who held the Word to be the <a id="l4687"></a>λόγος ἐνδιάθετος, generally held that this λόγος which had been seated inward<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ly<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l4688"></a>in the substance &amp; heart of the father from all eternity was a little before <a id="l4689"></a>the creation of the world emitted outwardly &amp; became the λόγος προφορικὸς <a id="l4690"></a>&amp; some explained this emission by a   projection or dilatation of some part of the fathers <a id="l4691"></a>substance with an inherent power, as light from the sun as a branch from the root, a river from the fountain, an ofspring <a id="l4692"></a>from the parents, &amp; breath with a sound from a man. And this emission projection <a id="l4693"></a>or dilatation they called the  generation of the λόγος into a son, &amp; made the <a id="l4694"></a>λόγος προφόρικος to be the son  of God generated a little before the creation &amp; in order to it, &amp; others (as Marcellus &amp; perhaps Paul <a id="l4695"></a>of Samosat) did not make the λόγος προφόρικος to be the Son of God before <a id="l4696"></a> Iesus Christ was born of the Virgin.  But these opinions that the  Word of God was <a id="l4699"></a>either the λογος προφορικὸς or the λογος ἐνδιάθετος being condemned in <a id="l4700"></a>Photinus by the Council of Sirmium  were soon relinquished &amp; <a id="l4701"></a>came to an end.</p>

<p id="par526">In the three first centuries I do not meet with the opinion that  <a id="l4702"></a>the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος was the son of God begotten from all eternity. Alexander <a id="l4703"></a>bishop of Alexandria so far as I can find was the first author of this opinion. Before his days the <a id="l4704"></a>antemundane nativity of the λόγος προφορικος was the growing opinion. But it being <a id="l4705"></a>objected that this opinion made the father mutable, it was rejected by both <a id="l4706"></a>Alexander &amp; Arius, &amp;  instead thereof Alexander taught that <a id="l4707"></a>the son was  the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος begotten of the father from all eternity <a id="l4708"></a>&amp; Arius that he was not the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος  nor <a id="l4709"></a>begotten of the fathers substance but another λόγος produced out of nothing <a id="l4710"></a>before the world began. And henceforward the doctrine of eternal generation <a id="l4711"></a>being received by Athanasius &amp; the Moncks got grownd in the Churches. And <a id="l4712"></a>having once taken root remained &amp; spread even after the  fundamental doctrine that the <a id="l4713"></a>Word was the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος ἢ προφόρικος was exploded; those that <a id="l4714"></a>beleived the antemundane generation of the λόγος προφορικὸς easily changing <a id="l4715"></a>their opinion for that of the æternal generation of the λόγος  </p>

He made the Emperor beleive <a id="l4718"></a>that Arsenius was alive, but  the Meletians <a id="l4719"></a>persisting in the accusation &amp; Arsenius not appearing, the Emperor <a id="l4720"></a>ordered Athanasius to give an account of this matter before the <a id="l4721"></a>Council of <span class="hspac-n" title="12 characters space left blank.">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Athanasius came not &amp; therefore the Emperor <a id="l4722"></a>ordered him to appeare the next year before the Council of Tyre <a id="l4723"></a>&amp; threatned that if he came not he would send those for him that <a id="l4724"></a>should carry him thither. Then Athanasius went with a great multitude <a id="l4725"></a>&amp;  pretended that Arsenius was alive as he knew by a letter which when the Council had heard the cause between him &amp; his accusers <a id="l4726"></a>they sent  for their further satisfaction six of their <a id="l4727"></a>numbers to the places in Egypt where the facts were done  to <a id="l4728"></a>examin persons upon the spot, &amp; upon their report Athanasius <a id="l4729"></a>fled from the Council to the Emperor.</p>

In the prophesy <a id="l4789"></a>of the he Goat this kingdom is derived from the kingdom of Pergamus represented <a id="l4790"></a>by the little horn of that Beast in this of the scripture of truth it is derived from the <a id="l4791"></a>kingdom of Macedon  standing up in the power of the Romans. ffor it <a id="l4792"></a>arose from them both growing into one by the Legacy of Attalus, &amp; it was <a id="l4793"></a>fit that both its originals should be represented in these prophesies. And <a id="l4794"></a>whilst the little  horn  became mighty but not in his own power; the Arms <a id="l4795"></a>which stood up after Antiochus Epiphanes  &amp; became one with this <a id="l4796"></a> horn, was also to be mighty but not in his own power.</p>

<p id="par539">The  Greek Empire being founded by the conquests of the kingdom of Macedon,  lasted <a id="l4797"></a>while this kingdom stood unconquered; &amp; therefore the holy spirit in descri<a id="l4798"></a>bing the affairs of Alexander the great &amp; his successors the kings of the <a id="l4799"></a>North &amp; South bordering upon the holy land,  is very particular untill he comes to the conquest of <a id="l4800"></a> the kingdom of Macedon by the Romans. For he carries on that <a id="l4801"></a> description   of the single  kings until the profanation of the Temple by Antiochus Epiphanes  which was on Novemb 1 in the year of Philip 156 as above,  &amp; Perseus the last king of Macedon was conquered by Æmilius the <a id="l4805"></a>Roman Consul on  September 10 in the same year.  By this means the prophesy points out the period of time in which the king of fierce countenance began to stand up &amp; the fourth Empire <a id="l4807"></a>began to reign. And henceforward the holy spirit describes the <a id="l4808"></a>affairs of the Greeks under the  power of the Romans  &amp; makes no more mention of  particular kings <a id="l4813"></a>(for the Romans were governed by a senate) nor insists upon particular <a id="l4814"></a>wars &amp; actions; but touches only upon the greatest &amp; most general <a id="l4815"></a>turns of affairs &amp; passes on by large periods of time   to the day of judgment. <a id="l4817"></a> The first period  conteins the  <a id="l4818"></a>reign of the Greeks under the Romans or Latines, the second conteins the  <a id="l4819"></a>reign of the Greeks alone after separation from the Latines, the third <a id="l4820"></a> is called the time of the <a id="l4821"></a>end &amp; conteins the reign of the kings of the south &amp; north over the Greeks <a id="l4822"></a>or some part of them.  For this whole prophesy relates to <a id="l4823"></a>the  nations of the Greek Empire represented by the he Goat. The first <a id="l4824"></a> interval of time is ushered in with these words: <em class="underline"> but it shall not prosper</em>: for yet <a id="l4825"></a><em class="underline">the end shall be at the time appointed</em>, that is the conspiracy of the kings of <a id="l4826"></a>Syria &amp; Egypt against the holy covenant for taking away the daily worship of the <a id="l4827"></a>Iews &amp; setting up the   worship of the heathen Gods in all the <a id="l4828"></a>land of Iudea shall not prosper because  the time of the end in which the  transgression of desolation is to prosper is not yet arrived the end <a id="l4829"></a>in which the setting up of the abomination of desolation was to prosper  is not yet, <a id="l4830"></a>but there is still a time appointed before the time of the end begins. The second <a id="l4831"></a> interval of time is ushered in with these words, <em class="underline">And of those of understanding there shall <a id="l4832"></a>fall to try them &amp; to purge &amp; make white to the time of the end,  For a king shall do <a id="l4833"></a>according to his will – &amp; shall prosper till the indignation shall be accomplished</em>, that is <a id="l4834"></a>a king shall do according to his will in making laws about religion &amp; in setting up the abomination represented by the <a id="l4835"></a>worship of the Mahuzzims, &amp; shall prosper till the indignation  against the <a id="l4836"></a>holy covenant shall be accomplished, &amp; by the setting up this abomination those of <a id="l4837"></a>understanding who oppose it shall  fall in the reign &amp; by the persecution of this king <a id="l4838"></a>till the time of the end. And the  second part of the second interval <a id="l4839"></a>begins with these words. <em class="underline">And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push <a id="l4840"></a>at him</em>. In all this   time of the end therefore the worship of fals Gods set up <a id="l4841"></a>by the king who  doth according to his will was <a id="l4842"></a>to prosper  &amp; reign &amp; make <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p180r"> &lt;180r&gt; </span> desolate the people of God, &amp; therefore it is called the  transgression of desolation &amp; the <a id="l4843"></a>indignation against the holy covenant. But let us go over the particulars.</p>
<p id="par540"><em class="underline">And after him arms shall stand up</em> that is after the reign of Antiochus carried <a id="l4844"></a>on to his second expedition into Egypt &amp; return into Syria, a power shall rise up, the <a id="l4845"></a>power of the kingdom of Macedon  by the access of the power of the Romans <a id="l4846"></a>&amp; of the kingdom of Pergamus &amp; by the conquest of  Syria Palestine &amp; Egypt <a id="l4847"></a>shall stand up with mighty dominion.  Now when these arms were thus risen up they made <a id="l4848"></a>war upon the Iews in the reigns of Nero Vespasian Trajan &amp; Hadrian, burnt their Temple <a id="l4849"></a>destroyed their city set up the heathen Gods in all Iudea &amp; dispersed the people into <a id="l4850"></a>all nations forbidding them to enter  Iudea upon pain of death. And all this is <a id="l4851"></a>described by Daniel in the next words: And they shall pollute . . . . . . . Mountains <a id="l4852"></a>Mat XXIV.15. This first setting up of</p>

<p id="par548"><sup class="note" id="n42-ref">[42]</sup> There being one usia &amp; three hypostases piously professed by us <a id="l4917"></a>(for the one denotes the nature of the deity, &amp; the other the properties <a id="l4918"></a>of the three ) &amp; these being in like manner understood <a id="l4919"></a>by the Latines who by reason of the narrowness of their language &amp; <a id="l4920"></a>want of names could not distinguish hypostasis from usia:  They therefor <a id="l4921"></a>introduced the language of three persons least they should admit three <a id="l4922"></a>usias. And what happened from thence? A thing very ridiculous or ra<a id="l4923"></a>ther miserable.  That  light &amp; empty contension <a id="l4924"></a>about the sound of words  seemed to  amount unto a difference of faith. There <a id="l4925"></a>was Sabellianism  imputed to the language of three persons &amp; Arianism <a id="l4926"></a>to that of three hypostases: both which names were  feigned by the <span class="app" title="The author presented alternate readings of this text."><span class="sub">study</span>&nbsp;<span class="nb-n">|</span>&nbsp;<span class="sup">zeale</span></span> of conten<a id="l4927"></a>ding. And what followed? When something was ever added to the  troubles (the troubles I say made by the desire of <a id="l4929"></a>contending:) at length the ends of the earth were in danger of being broken together <a id="l4930"></a>with the syllables. Therfore that blessed man that man of God truly so called <a id="l4931"></a>that great dispenser of souls, seing &amp; hearing these things did not think that   such an <a id="l4932"></a>absurd &amp; unreasonable section of the word should be neglected <a id="l4933"></a>but  he himself applied a medicine to the distemper. And what was <a id="l4934"></a>that? Calling both parties together before him with lenity &amp; mildness, &amp; accurate<a id="l4935"></a>ly considering the sence &amp; meaning of their words, after he found them <a id="l4936"></a>agreeing &amp; not at all differing in opinion, he indulged them their use of <a id="l4937"></a>words &amp;  bound them only by the  things.  Thus far Gregory. And <a id="l4938"></a>henceforward the   two contending parties <a id="l4939"></a>allowed one anothers language, &amp; the Latines to exclude the Sabellian signification <a id="l4940"></a>of three persons invented the language of three substances &amp; began also to use <a id="l4941"></a>language of three hypostases. So then the language of the two united parties  <a id="l4942"></a>was henceforward μία ὀυσία,  una substantia,  &amp; τρεις ὑποστάσεις <a id="l4943"></a> tres personæ  tres subsistentiæ : that is one substance in nature <a id="l4944"></a>&amp; kind &amp; three intelligent substances in number. For this was the sense which Athanasius taught the two <a id="l4945"></a>contending parties, as you may see in his epistle to those of Antioch.</p>
<p id="par549">So Epiphanius testifies that they did not hold the father &amp; son to be μονοούσιοι <a id="l4946"></a>or ταυτοούσιοι but  ὁμοούσιοι &amp; Basil that for clearing our selves <a id="l4947"></a>from Sabellianism it is not enough to name three persons if  we do not confess every person to subsist in a true hypostasis or substance  &amp; the second general Council decreed the son consubstantial to the father in the same sence with the C. of Nice &amp; the word it self implies two substances &amp; the third general Council decreed that Christ is consubstantial to the father as <a id="l4949"></a>touching his Godhead &amp; consubstantial to us as touching his manhood &amp; the fourth gene<a id="l4950"></a>ral Council confirmed the  faith of the third. And in  short,  Curcellæus, <a id="l4951"></a>D<sup>r</sup> Cudworth, D<sup>r</sup> Bull, Petavius &amp; Huetius have proved beyond exception that the <a id="l4952"></a>Churches of the fourth &amp; fifth &amp; following  centuries held the father son &amp; holy <a id="l4953"></a>Ghost to be three substances in number &amp; one in nature: Yet in the dark ages by the <a id="l4954"></a>language of una substantia   the opinion of a single substance silently revived among the Latines &amp; made <a id="l4955"></a>persons subsistences &amp; hypostases to be taken  for something else then substances by the Schoolmen who under<a id="l4956"></a>stood not Greek, &amp; the Sabellians who denyed three hypostases,  <a id="l4957"></a>to  deny three persons not substantial.</p>
<p id="par550">– And the same Athanasius in his exposition of faith condemns the Sabelli<a id="l4958"></a>ans for making the Son μονοούσιος not ὁμοούσιος to the father. <a id="l4959"></a>And Epiphanius<sup class="note" id="n43-ref">[43]</sup> that the Son was not ταυτοούσιος to the father, but <a id="l4960"></a>ὁμοούσιος &amp; that the word ταυτοούσιος being used by some, draws to Sabelli<a id="l4961"></a>anism. And Basil: that for clearing our selves from Sabellianism <a id="l4962"></a>it is not enough to name three persons (which Sabellius himself would not refuse to do) if we do not confess every person <a id="l4963"></a>to subsist in a true hypostasis or substance Epist. 64.

<p id="par557" class="i0"> Sabellius often confounding the  understanding undertook to  distinguish the <a id="l5019"></a>persons saying that the same hypostasis or substance was transformed upon every occasion <a id="l5020"></a>which was offerred. Basil. Epist 392. If  the word person be taken in the same sense with hypostasis, that is for an intelligent <a id="l5021"></a>substance, Sabellius held but one person: if for a power forme or mode of appear<a id="l5022"></a>ance he  allowed a variety of persons   much after the manner of Simon <a id="l5023"></a>Magus who   said that one &amp; the same God appeared sometimes as the   father sometimes as  the son &amp; sometimes as  the h. ghost. ffo it was in various respects that Sabellius called  God by the names of the father son &amp; h. Ghost. But   he  did <a id="l5027"></a> not  make himself  that God, as Simon did <a id="l5028"></a>ffor Simon taught that he himself was the supreme God who appeared among the Iews <a id="l5029"></a>as the son &amp; descended in Samaria as the Father &amp; came to other nations <a id="l5030"></a>as the h. Ghost. Iren. l. 1 c 20.  If this difference <a id="l5031"></a>between the opinions of Simon &amp; Sabellius be excepted the heresy of Sabellius  <a id="l5032"></a>descended from Simon.</p>
<p id="par558">You have heard that Athanasius interpreted the Nicene Creed of <a id="l5033"></a>the consubstantial substances of the father &amp; son.  He doth it in several parts of his works. According to that Council the <a id="l5034"></a>son was begotten of the  substance  of the father &amp; in  his likeness &amp; therefore had a substance of his own &amp; he was God of God <a id="l5035"></a>light of light &amp; therefore in the sense of the C. was consubstantial to the father as one light is consubstan<a id="l5036"></a>tial to another. All parties  allowed  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p182r"> &lt;182r&gt; </span> that the son was like the father as being the image of the invisible God; &amp; the homou<a id="l5037"></a>sians  contended for a perfect likeness, such a likeness as amounted <a id="l5038"></a>to an equality &amp;  taught that  such a likeness amounted to a consub<a id="l5039"></a>stantiality, &amp; that απαραλλατως ὁμοιος signified the same thing with ὁμοούσιος,  <a id="l5042"></a> ③ They taught that ὁυσία &amp; substantia were common names  or names which denoted the <a id="l5043"></a>common nature of the three persons as homo is a common name &amp; denotes the common nature of men <a id="l5044"></a>&amp; that the hypostases or subsistences of the father son &amp; holy ghost were proper names or names <a id="l5045"></a>which  signified the single subsisting properties or proper subsistensies of the individuals as Peter  is a proper name &amp; signi<a id="l5046"></a>fies not that which is  common to Peter <a id="l5047"></a>&amp; Iohn but all that which is propper to Peter &amp; subsists in him alone, that is, the proper <a id="l5048"></a>substance of Peter with all the proper habits  powers  forms &amp; qualities  actually subsisting in that <a id="l5049"></a>substance &amp; sometimes they said that there was one ουσία of the three persons as there was one usia of three men ✝<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 181v &gt; </span>✝ but with this difference, that three  men were divided from one another, but the <a id="l5050"></a>three divine persons were undivided, like a root &amp; its branches, a fountain &amp; its streams, <a id="l5051"></a>or three cohering Suns which intermix their light; so that singly they were <a id="l5052"></a>three whole substances.  &amp; yet jointly but one  undivided whole.<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 182r resumes &gt; </span> ② They taught that if the son or Word of God was like any of the creatures <a id="l5054"></a>he would be consubstantial to those creatures but if he was like the father he <a id="l5055"></a>must be consubstantial to the father &amp; that as every  natural son is consubstantial <a id="l5056"></a>to his father so the natural son of God must be consubstantial to his father, &amp; that he was <a id="l5057"></a>consubstantial to the father as touching his Godhead &amp; consubstantial to us as <a id="l5058"></a>touching his manhood. ‡ <span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; insertion from f 181v &gt; </span>‡ And these notions of the  Trinity are almost every where   in the writings of Athanasius, Hilary, Epiphanius, Basil, Greg.

<p id="par559">And Agapius a heathen that the souls of men are consubstantial to God &amp;  <a id="l5065"></a>so are the sun Moon &amp; starrs. And Porphyry that <em class="underline">the souls of brutes are con<a id="l5066"></a>substantial to those of men</em>, namely by being all of them derived from the <a id="l5067"></a>substance of God. And in the same sense Aristotle, that all the stars are consubstantial,  
<span class="pagenumber-embed"> &lt; text from f 182r resumes &gt; </span> The homousians taught also that the son was not μονοούσιος or τατοούσιος <a id="l5068"></a>to the father but ὁμοούσιος, &amp; that to  make them  μονοούσιοι or <a id="l5069"></a>ταυτοούσιοι or to take the three person for  any thing  else then personal substances tended to sabellianism <a id="l5071"></a>So Basil tells us that because the son is the image of the father he is consubstan<a id="l5072"></a>tial to him  &amp; that ὅμοιος κατ᾽ <a id="l5073"></a>ὀυσίαν like according to substance with an invariable likeness is the same with <a id="l5074"></a>ομοούσιος in the sense of the Nicene Council &amp; that there is one usia <a id="l5075"></a>of Peter &amp; Paul, &amp; ὁν ἔχει λόγον . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . you will not err. Basil tells us <a id="l5076"></a>also that for clearing our selves from Sabellianism it is not – – – – – – – – – <a id="l5077"></a>And in his 349 epistle disputing against the language of those of Antioch who <a id="l5078"></a>called the three persons one hypostasis – – – – – congrua expetat nomina. And upon <a id="l5079"></a>this account Athanasius  in his exposition of faith condemns the Sabelli<a id="l5080"></a>ans for making the son μονοούσιος not ὁμοούσιος to the father – And Epipha<a id="l5081"></a>nius saith that the son was not ταυτοούσιος to  the father but ὁμοούσιος &amp; <a id="l5082"></a>that the word τατοούσιος being used by some, draws to sabellianism. Sabellius <a id="l5083"></a>therefore taught – – – – – – hypostasis into that of three: the language of three <a id="l5084"></a>persons &amp; τρία πρότωπα being found insufficient to clear the  Monousian <a id="l5085"></a>faith from Sabellianism.</p>
<p id="par560">It would be tedious to run over the writings of all that have explained <a id="l5086"></a>the doctrine of thre consubstantial hypostases: but they that have leasure will find <a id="l5087"></a>that Athanasius, Hilary, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory Nyssen, Chrysostome Ambrose Ierome <a id="l5088"></a>Austin, Theodoret, Cyrill of Alexandria Leontius Byzantinus, Iohn Damascene, Theodorus Abucara,  Euthymius Zygabenus, Theorianus &amp;c wherever they have had occasion <a id="l5090"></a>to explain this doctrine have take one usia &amp; three hypostases, one substance <a id="l5091"></a>&amp; thre subsistences  for one  in nature &amp; kind &amp; three in number. And several <a id="l5092"></a>Councils have done the like as the Councils of Antioch A.C. 363  who say that the Council of Nice cautiously explained the <a id="l5094"></a>Consubstantiality of the Son by his likeness to the father, the Council of <a id="l5095"></a>Rome under Damasus A.C. 379   who declared that the Son was  <a id="l5096"></a>begotten of the substance of the father &amp; equal to him &amp; that the divinity <a id="l5097"></a>of the father son &amp; holy ghost was una &amp; æqualis.  The second general Council who  ratified the Nicene faith. The fourth general <a id="l5098"></a>Council who say that  Christ was consubstantial to the father as touching his Godhead <a id="l5099"></a>&amp; consubstantial to us as touching his manhood.  And the third general <a id="l5100"></a>Council  who decreed that the two hypostases of God &amp; man were united &amp; became one. <a id="l5101"></a>If the hypostasis of the man Iesus was a substance composed of body &amp; soul <a id="l5102"></a>the two hypostases of God &amp; man must be two substances &amp; neither of them <a id="l5103"></a>must be the substance of the father least the father should be incarnate &amp; suffer <a id="l5104"></a>ffor this Council decreed that God the word  did not inhabit the man <a id="l5105"></a>Iesus, as the spirit of God dwells in holy men, but became flesh &amp; communicated <a id="l5106"></a>with flesh &amp; blood like one of us (that is as the spirit of a man communicates <a id="l5107"></a>with his soul &amp; body &amp;  is united with them into one man) &amp;  that the Word suffered died &amp; rose <a id="l5108"></a>again in the flesh. In short, that the Greeks &amp; Latines of the fourth &amp; following <a id="l5109"></a>ages,  as many as used the language of three hypostases  tooke these hypostases <a id="l5110"></a>for  three substances of one nature &amp; species has <a id="l5111"></a>been so fully proved by Petavius <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p181v-b"> &lt;181v-b&gt; </span> Curcelleius, D<sup>r</sup> Cudworth, D<sup>r</sup> Bull &amp; Huetius that it cannot be disputed. And since <a id="l5112"></a>Euthymius Zygabenus &amp; Theorianus lived in the 12<sup>th</sup> century this <a id="l5113"></a>doctrine seems to have continued in the Greek Empire while that Empire stood. But <a id="l5114"></a> in the Latine Churches when the dark ages came on &amp; the signi<a id="l5115"></a>fications of the Greek words ὁμοούσιος &amp;  were no longer understood in the west the <a id="l5116"></a>language of una substantia  restored the opinion of a single substance <a id="l5117"></a>&amp;  made persons subsistences &amp; hypostases be taken by the Schoolmen for something else then  <a id="l5118"></a>substances &amp; the single hypostasis of the Sabellians for something else then a single <a id="l5119"></a>substance. Yet the word essentia which answers to the word ὀυσία &amp; seems derived from it continues to this <a id="l5120"></a>day  among the Latines to signify one  common essence or nature  of  all the individual substances of one species or kind.</p>

<p id="par561">For the hereticks thinking it below the dignity of their principal Gods to be <a id="l5122"></a>really incarnate &amp; to suffer really on the cross, eluded the truth of Christs being <a id="l5123"></a>come  in the flesh by various opinions. Some of them, as Simon magus, Basilides <a id="l5124"></a>. . . . . Manes, said that Christ had not a  body of real flesh &amp; bones but only appeared <a id="l5125"></a>to men in shew: &amp; others as Cerinthus Carpocrates Marcus Colarbasus Mon<a id="l5126"></a>tanus, Proclus,  Sabllius Paul of Samosat, Photinus &amp; I think Artemas, Theodotus, Marcellus, Eustathius <a id="l5127"></a>&amp; the rest of the Cataphrygians Paulinists &amp; Sabellians said that Iesus was a  mere man born <a id="l5128"></a>after the manner of other men &amp; that a vertue or spirit called the λόγος or <a id="l5129"></a>Word dwelt in him as the holy spirit doth in good men &amp; performed the divine <a id="l5130"></a>operations. And this composition the Montanists called one person &amp; said that it <a id="l5131"></a>was made without confusion of substance. And Praxeas &amp; Noetus said that this <a id="l5132"></a>spirit was the father or some part of him &amp; were thence called patripassians. <a id="l5133"></a>But Iohn the Apostle tells us: <em class="underline">Every spirit that confesseth not that Iesus Christ <a id="l5134"></a>is come in the flesh is not of God &amp; this is the spirit of Antichrist, whereof you <a id="l5135"></a>have heard that it should come, &amp; even now,  already it is in the world</em>. <a id="l5136"></a>This was one character of Antichrist &amp; another was to deny the father &amp; <a id="l5137"></a>the son, as all those did who made the son to be either the Idea or <a id="l5138"></a>λόγος  ἐνδιάθετὸς or προφορικὸς  of the father or any part or power <a id="l5139"></a>of the fathers substance, &amp; in this sense worshipped them both  with <a id="l5140"></a>divine worship. For this was the theology of the heathens.  They made the parts <a id="l5141"></a>&amp; powers of God  to be his  sons &amp; explained <a id="l5142"></a>the generation of such sons by emission prolation or projection of  those parts or powers but <a id="l5143"></a>the Christian religion is a stranger to such  generations.</p>
<p id="par562">Yet the opinion that the Word was from all eternity the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος  of God &amp; a little before <a id="l5144"></a>the world began was emitted outwardly &amp; by such emission became the λόγος προφορικὸς <a id="l5145"></a>&amp;  the son of God, was a growing opinion in the <a id="l5146"></a> second &amp; third centuries &amp; the first half of the fourth &amp; infected some <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p183v"> &lt;183v&gt; </span> of note in the Church whom I <a id="l5147"></a>forbear to mention.

<p id="par564">The next year Hilary returning into Gallia, made it his business to <a id="l5157"></a><span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>propagate<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> this doctrine in those parts &amp; for  establishing it got the bishops to <a id="l5158"></a>meet in several small councils &amp; being favoured by the bishop of Rome went <a id="l5159"></a>into <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Italy<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> on the same account.

<span class="pagenumber" id="p183Ar"> &lt;183Ar&gt; </span>
<p id="par565" class="i0">but presently after the death of Iulian the Apostate they  added the  deity of the H.G &amp; made him coequal to the father &amp; the son  . For  Gregory Nazianzen who lived in those times gives this account of  <a id="l5172"></a>the beginning of this new controversy.</p>
<p id="par566">But tho the consubstantiality made</p>
<p id="par567">The opinion that the son of God was  the λογος προφορικὸς  emitted by <a id="l5173"></a>the father not from all eternity but a little before the world began  was  warily embraced <a id="l5174"></a>by some men of note in the Church in the second &amp; third centuries, as by <a id="l5175"></a>Theophilus bishop of Antioch, Athenagoras,  Clemens master of the <a id="l5176"></a>school of Alexandria, Tertullian, Hippolytus martyr, Lactantius</p>
<p id="par568">The opinion that the   son of God was the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος of  <a id="l5177"></a>the father seated in him from all eternity, crept into the Church very early</p>
<p id="par569">Besides the heresiarchs who were openly condemned &amp; exploded, there were some very early in  the <a id="l5178"></a>Church who imbibed the heathen philosophy without being censured for it. Such <a id="l5179"></a>were they whom Iustin Martyr mentions in this manner.</p>
<p id="par570">The opinion which  most prevailed with the Christians was that the λόγος of <a id="l5180"></a>the Apostle Iohn was the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος the inherent Word &amp; wisdom of the father <a id="l5181"></a>&amp; that this word was inherent in the father from all eternity,  &amp; a little <a id="l5182"></a>before the world began was emitted outwardly as a voice from a man or as a ray of light from <span class="ns">☉</span> or <a id="l5183"></a>water from the fountain or a branch from the root. And this emission they called the <a id="l5184"></a>generation of the son. Of this opinion I reccon those Christians mentioned by Iust<a id="l5185"></a>in as above, &amp; Tatian &amp; Theophilus of Antioch &amp; <span class="hi-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is highly confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>Athenagoras<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; Clemens master <a id="l5186"></a>of the school at Alexandria &amp; perhaps his successor Origen &amp; Hippolytus the  martyr &amp; Lactantius &amp; <a id="l5187"></a>Constantine the great. ffor Constantine in an Epistle which he sent – – – – &amp; <a id="l5188"></a>caused to be published in all the cities of the Roman Empire just before <a id="l5189"></a>the meeting of the Council of Nice, spake thus to Arius – which were <a id="l5190"></a>made by him. Hitherto the said antemundane generation of the λογος had been a growing opinion in the Churches, But Alexander     bishop of Alexandria &amp; Athanasius in the disputes which they had wih Arius dropt this antemundane generation &amp; declared  <a id="l5192"></a> the λογος ενδιαθετος   to be the son of God by an eternal generation <a id="l5193"></a> received   And at length the opinion that the son of God was the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος <a id="l5194"></a>being condemned in Photinus by the Council of Sirmium was totaly exploded &amp; <a id="l5195"></a>ceased in a few years,  the faith &amp; definitions of that Council being <a id="l5196"></a>universally  approved &amp; received: But the opinion of eternal generation <a id="l5197"></a>still continued &amp; got ground. I reccon Alexander the author of this opinion becaus his adversaries said that by  his opinion the Son was ἀγενετος unbegotten, &amp; they never before heard of two that were unbegotten</p>
<p id="par571">Hitherto the Son had been accounted subordinate to the father by all <a id="l5198"></a>parties, those who held the antemundane generation teaching that the father <a id="l5199"></a> emitted or begot the son  by the <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>force<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> &amp; power of his will in order <a id="l5200"></a>to create the world.  But soon after <a id="l5202"></a>the condemnation of Photinus they began to equal the son to the father  <a id="l5203"></a>equal substances &amp;  one of the first who did so was <a id="l5204"></a>Hilary.</p>

And to excommunicate any <a id="l5414"></a>man for not beleiving more is  to <a id="l5415"></a>leave the love of the primitive Christians, to be uncharitable to the members of <a id="l5416"></a>Christs mystical body, to rend  that body asunder &amp; to become guilty of <a id="l5417"></a>schism, a crime as much greater then heresy it self, as Charity is a greater <a id="l5418"></a>grace then vertue.

<p id="par602" class="i0">The scriptures are the rule of truth  &amp; the primitive Creed the rule of <a id="l5438"></a>faith requisite to communion. For There are many truths in scripture which a man may be <a id="l5439"></a>ignorant of without deserving to be excommunicated for his ignorance, <a id="l5440"></a> And in the primitive ages few men had all the scriptures &amp; <a id="l5441"></a>some nations into which the Christian religion was propagated had not <a id="l5442"></a>so much as the use of letters: But all men were to learn all the <a id="l5443"></a>articles of their Creed before they were admitted into communion <a id="l5444"></a>by baptism; And a systeme of these Articles wehave given you <a id="l5445"></a>above by rejecting out of the Creeds of the Greeks &amp; Latines such <a id="l5446"></a>articles as have been inserted since the beginning. And as  <a id="l5447"></a>the Christians of all nations were in the primitive times united <a id="l5448"></a>into one mystical body by  one Rule of faith &amp; communion <a id="l5449"></a>&amp; by departing from this Rule brake into many factions &amp; parties <a id="l5450"></a>so it is not to be expected that all the parties of Christians should <a id="l5451"></a>ever  reunite into one mystical body of Christ untill they shall return to the <a id="l5452"></a>primitive rule of communion.</p>
<p id="par603">Yet considering that the Creed usually called the Apostles Creed <a id="l5453"></a>is generally received by the  Churches of the Latines, I do not <a id="l5454"></a>see  but that  it may be   still  allowed them for the sake of peace provi<a id="l5455"></a>ded the Articles which have been inserted since the beginning be  under<a id="l5456"></a>stood in such a sense as is consonant to  scripture [&amp; not imposed upon <a id="l5457"></a>the Churches of the Greeks, Aremenians,  Syrians, Coptites, Ethiopians or any other <a id="l5458"></a>Churches  as primitive articles necessary to baptism &amp; communion. </p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p187r"> &lt;187r&gt; </span>
<p id="par604" class="i0">For By the descent into hell may be understood that Christ died really &amp; <a id="l5464"></a>truly &amp; in all respects underwent the state of the dead; without entring <a id="l5465"></a>into particular opinions about that state. By the resurrection of the <a id="l5466"></a>body may be understood that every man shall revive with his own spiritual <a id="l5467"></a>immortal body; without entring into  particular opinions &amp; controversies about the nature <a id="l5468"></a>of that body. By the remission of sins may be understood the remission <a id="l5469"></a>of sins at the day of judgment of all such as heartily &amp; sincerely repent <a id="l5470"></a>in this life; without entring into disputes about the power of the   <a id="l5471"></a>By the communion of Saints may be understood the duty of all Christians <a id="l5472"></a>to live in communion &amp; charity &amp; to love one another; without medling with <a id="l5473"></a>the doctrine of ghosts or dæmons. And by the holy Catholick Church may <a id="l5474"></a>be understood a  body of all those who live in such communion, serving one God &amp; one Lord &amp; being united in <a id="l5475"></a> one faith the faith which was once delivered to the saints,  &amp; avoiding quarrels about other opinions as contrary to <a id="l5478"></a>the indispensible duty of charity. [And with such interpretations of these <a id="l5479"></a>articles I conceive it  better to  indulge the use of this Creed to the Latines then to <a id="l5480"></a>create disputes &amp; prejudices by rejecting  what has been added to it] <a id="l5481"></a>ffor in such a sense these articles are nothing more then explications of the primi<a id="l5482"></a>tive articles of the Creed &amp; of the Charity by which  &amp; one faith men are to continue united in <a id="l5483"></a>the Church into which they are admitted by baptism </p>

<p id="par605" class="i0">By the last words he means that when the Bishops in their communi<a id="l5484"></a>catory letters explained their faith (as they did very frequently), they did not tye themselves to a <a id="l5485"></a>set form of words, but expressed themselves in words more or less copious <a id="l5486"></a>&amp; eloquent according to every mans ability, &amp; yet all of them from one <a id="l5487"></a>end of the earth to the other end thereof agreed in the number &amp; <a id="l5488"></a>sense of the articles of their communicatory faith, without adding  diminishing or altering any thing, as if the whole Christian world <a id="l5490"></a>had but one soul &amp; one mind.</p>
<p id="par606">By what has been said it may seem that the Creeds now in use have all <a id="l5491"></a>of them been altered, &amp; yet  considering that the Creed usually called the <a id="l5492"></a>Apostles Creed</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p188r"> &lt;188r&gt; </span>
<p id="par607" class="i0">&amp; imports that the controversy about the  h. g. was set on foot by Ath.  <a id="l5493"></a>in the reign of Iovian which was about 10 years  before &amp; from Egypt &amp; Syria <a id="l5494"></a>spread into the west, that after the death of Iovian  which happened <a id="l5495"></a>A.C. 364 it was restrained  in the Greek Empire under the dominion of <a id="l5496"></a>Valens being only whispered in  Asia &amp; Syria &amp; muttered in Egypt, <a id="l5497"></a>but in the western Empire under the dominion of Valentinian it was preached <a id="l5498"></a>openly with all freedom of speech. For the Emperor Valentinian left religion <a id="l5499"></a>to the bishops, &amp; gave them leave to meet in Councils about it as they thought <a id="l5500"></a>fit amongst themselves but Valens prohibited the  deifying of the holy Ghost <a id="l5501"></a>as polytheistical.</p>
<p id="par608">The  foundation of the sermon about the deity &amp; worship of the holy Ghost was laid by by the <a id="l5502"></a>Council of Serdica  in their assertion that there was but one hypostasis of <a id="l5503"></a>the father son &amp; holy Ghost &amp; that the hypostasis of the son was that which alone was <a id="l5504"></a>acknowledged to be the hypostasis of the father. But this did not yet create any controversy <a id="l5505"></a>about the holy Ghost. The controversy at this time was only about the Son. About two <a id="l5506"></a>years after, viz<sup>t</sup> A.C. 349, Athanasius in his return from the west into Egypt making <a id="l5507"></a>some stay at Antioch avoided the communion of  Leontius the bishop of that city <a id="l5508"></a>&amp; communicated with the disciples of Eustathius who had been desposed for Sabellianism <a id="l5509"></a>And at that time they began to sing the verses of the Psalms alternately &amp; to add <a id="l5510"></a>the doxology to the end of them, &amp; some said Glory be to the father &amp; the son <a id="l5511"></a>to denote an equality &amp; others Glory be to the father in the Son or Glory be to <a id="l5512"></a>the father by the Son in the h. G. to denote a subordination. But the holy Ghost was <a id="l5513"></a>not yet worshipped: the disputes hitherto were only about the son.</p>

<p id="par610">In all the writings of Hilary (his Epistle to the bishops of Gallia &amp; <a id="l5514"></a> Britain A.C. 358, his books against the Emperor Constantius A.C. 359 <a id="l5515"></a>360 361, his book aga</p>
<p id="par611">Hilary in all his works contends only about the deity of the son. I do not remember that <a id="l5516"></a>he gives the name of God to  the holy Ghost  or contends for his worship in <a id="l5517"></a>all his works. The Council of Paris convened A.C. 361 in a large profession of <a id="l5518"></a> faith disputes only for the deity of the son. Auxentius bishop of Millain <a id="l5519"></a> ten years after the Councils of Sirmium &amp; Ariminum that is A.C. <a id="l5520"></a>366 or 367 being vehemently accused by Hilary of  heresy defended himself only about the <a id="l5521"></a>deity of the Son without acknowledging the deity of the holy Ghost or being accused <a id="l5522"></a>by Hilary of denying  it &amp; was acquitted  as you may see in Hilaries book against him. And therefore the controversy about the deity <a id="l5523"></a>&amp; worship of the holy G. was not yet begun in the west. It seems the western <a id="l5524"></a>bishops were willing to let the deity of the holy Ghost alone till that <a id="l5525"></a>of the son was  established.</p>
<p id="par612">But after the consubstantiality  &amp; coequal  Deity of the Son was by the influence of the bishop of Rome &amp; industry of Hilary &amp; Eusebius sufficiently established Pope Damasus <a id="l5526"></a>A.C. 373 called a council of 93 bishops at Rome –</p>
<p id="par613">Their meaning in these words was that they hoped for an Emperor in a short time <a id="l5527"></a>who should turn out all the bishops  in the eastern Empire who  received not this faith as they  were beginning to turn out all in the western. <a id="l5529"></a>ffor Auxentius bishop of Millain had hitherto remained quiet, but now this Council <a id="l5530"></a>deposed him with some others in the west.</p>
<p id="par614">Thus they reestablished the language of the Council of Serdica</p>
<p id="par615">By these words it is manifest that the Bishop of Rome &amp; the western Churches of his communion had not yet separated from the communion of the Churches <a id="l5532"></a>of the Greek Empire. [But the churches of the whole Empire both Greeks &amp; Latines <a id="l5533"></a>whether they used the language of one usia &amp;  one hypostasis or that of one usia &amp; three <a id="l5534"></a>hypostases or rejected the language of one usia &amp; homousios,  continued hitherto in communion <a id="l5535"></a>with one another in one general visible church catholick.] But now the Latines began <a id="l5536"></a>to  resolve to impose their faith upon the whole Empire &amp;  remove <a id="l5537"></a>from their communion  &amp; deprive all the Bishops who think otherwise  <a id="l5538"></a>so soon as they should get an Emperor to put this designe in execution in the eastern <a id="l5539"></a>Empire as well as in the western. </p>
<p id="par616"> In September &amp; october  the Emperor Valentinian went  first to Rome &amp; then to Paris. What past between the Emperor &amp; the Bishop of Rome about <a id="l5542"></a>this matter is not recorded, but  at Paris a Council  of the bishops <a id="l5543"></a>of Gallia met &amp; [published a profession of faith wherein they declared their approba<a id="l5544"></a>tion of the faith of Hilary]  Hilary communicated to them a letter which some eastern bishops (I suppose at Antioch) had written <a id="l5545"></a> him &amp; in answer thereunto they returned to them a large profession of their faith in which  they  approved the faith &amp; communion  of <a id="l5546"></a> <span class="med-n" title="This text is unclear in the manuscript, but the editor is reasonably confident of the reading."><span class="nb-n">{</span>them<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>: Ex literis vestris, say they, quas  . . . . – unius, a nobis, vel usiæ vel [hyposta<a id="l5547"></a>seos substantiæ cum Deo patre confessum, ne creatura potius aut adoptio aut <a id="l5548"></a>appellatio videretur.

By this I  <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p188v"> &lt;188v&gt; </span> gather that Hilary upon publishing his book against Auxentius &amp; directing it to all the <a id="l5550"></a>bishops who detested the Arian heresy, had  accordingly sent copies of it to the ea<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>stern<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l5551"></a>bishops of his party as well as to the western &amp; received back their letter which he <a id="l5552"></a>communicated to this Council of Paris against Auxentius.</p>

<p id="par617" class="i0">Vpon his return into Gallia &amp; the revolt of Iulian the apostate,  A.C. 361 he wrote <a id="l5553"></a>a very railing book against the Emperor Constantius, calling him persecutor, Antichrist <a id="l5554"></a>tyrant, the most wicked of mortals, a ravening wolf, a man of a diabolical ingenuity &amp; yet <a id="l5555"></a>railing at him for his not persecuting but being mild,  courteous charitable pious &amp; religious.   <a id="l5556"></a> The book is usually  supposed to have been written after <a id="l5557"></a>the Emperors death, but was certainly writ before it because he constantly  <a id="l5558"></a>directs his speech to the Emperor as alive. From that time he set himself to sollicit the bishops <a id="l5559"></a>of Gallia to  return to the language of one substance &amp; homousios. <a id="l5560"></a> [&amp; receive his doctrine of two  like &amp; equal <a id="l5561"></a>substances in number &amp; one in nature &amp; species] And when he had made a <a id="l5562"></a>considerable party in Gallia he went into Italy with Eusebius Vercellensis to sollicit the bishops of Italy &amp; <a id="l5563"></a>accused Auxentius bishop of Millain   to the Emperor Valentinian of heresy.  <a id="l5564"></a>&amp; Auxentius accused Hilary &amp; Eusebius of being condemned persons &amp; endeavouring every <span class="lo-n" title="The editor is unsure of this reading because this text is unclear in the manuscript."><span class="nb-n">{</span>white<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> to make schisms. This was in the year 365 ten years after the Councils of Millain Sirmium &amp; <a id="l5565"></a>Ariminum. ffor the Emperor resided that year at Millain  till the month <a id="l5566"></a>of September. The cause was heard between Auxentius &amp; Hilary by the <a id="l5567"></a>Emperors order  <a id="l5569"></a>&amp; Auxentius sent his faith with the Acts of the Council of Ariminum to the Emperor in his defense <a id="l5570"></a> &amp; was acquitted &amp; Hilary <a id="l5571"></a> ordered to depart  Millain whereupon he wrote his book against Auxentius. In all this contention the debate was only about <a id="l5572"></a>the deity of the son.  Auxentius neither acknowledged the deity of the <a id="l5573"></a>holy Ghost nor was accused of denying it.    And therefore the controversy about <a id="l5574"></a>the deity   – of the holy G. was not yet begun in the west. The whole <a id="l5575"></a>story you have in Hilary's book written at that time against Auxentius &amp; in the Epistle of Auxentius <a id="l5576"></a>to the Emperor annexed to it. This book was directed to the bishops detesting the Arian Heresy &amp; reflected upon  Valens Vrsatius Auxentius Germichus &amp; Caius as Arians.</p>
<p id="par618">The same year in September &amp; October the Emperor Valentinian <a id="l5577"></a>went first to Rome &amp; then to Paris in Gallia. What past between the Emperor <a id="l5578"></a>&amp;  Liberius bishop of Rome about this matter is not  recorded. But that winter a <a id="l5579"></a>Council of the bishops of Gallia met at Paris &amp; Hilary communicated to them a <a id="l5580"></a>letter which he had received from some eastern Bishops in  which they desired that Auxen<a id="l5581"></a>tius Vrsatius Valens Gaius Megasius &amp; Iustinus might be excommunicated. And this <a id="l5582"></a>Council excommunicated them accordingly &amp; sent back to those eastern bishops a large <a id="l5583"></a>profession of their faith. Ex literis vestris, say they, . . . . . . . . unius, a nobis, idcirco <a id="l5584"></a>vel usiæ vel  substantiæ cum Deo patre confessum ne creatura <a id="l5585"></a>potius aut adoptio  aut appellatio videretur. This faith is the very same <a id="l5586"></a>with that which Hilary had sent to them eight years before in his Epistle <a id="l5587"></a>to the bishops of Gallia &amp; britain &amp; had ever since his return been preaching to them, namely that the father &amp; son  have no common substance but are two like &amp; equal substan<a id="l5589"></a>ces in number &amp; one in nature &amp; species, the whole son being the son of the whole <a id="l5590"></a>father. But about the deity of the holy ghost there is not one word in all <a id="l5591"></a>this long profession of faith, &amp; therefore the controversy about the deity of the <a id="l5592"></a>holy Ghost was not yet set on foot in the west: but Gallia by the means of Hilary was now retuned <a id="l5593"></a>to the  faith &amp; profession of one usia &amp; one substance of the father &amp; <a id="l5594"></a>son &amp; of their being consubstantial.

For  the Platonists taught that all  things were latent in the internal inherent <a id="l5638"></a> ideas of God from all eternity, &amp; were at length  exerted &amp; produced outwardly by such acts of  God as the heathens metaphysically represented by the  humane acts of generation &amp; manufactu<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>re<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>   , &amp; called generation in respect of things intellectual &amp; manufacture work structure or creation in respect of things <a id="l5641"></a>corporeal or compound.

<p id="par628">In the Council of Nice Eusebius of Cæsarea produced the Creed of his Church which he had received from former Bishops &amp; into <a id="l5673"></a>which  he had been baptized: &amp;  in this Creed the Son is called light of light <a id="l5674"></a>the first begotten of every creature begotten of God the father before all ages, by <a id="l5675"></a>whom all things were made: which  language  shews that the philosophical <a id="l5676"></a>Christians   who held the antemundane generation of the Son &amp; compared  it to the emission of a ray of light from <span class="ns">☉</span> had got <a id="l5678"></a>their opinion into the Creeds of some Churches before the end of the third century.  </p>
<p id="par629">Antony – – – – – – –</p>
<p id="par630"> This Constantine wrote   with relation to the Nicene faith <a id="l5680"></a> &amp; therefore by the words of the Creed <em class="underline">begotten before all ages</em>, <a id="l5681"></a>understood that the son of God, who was always  in the father as his inherent <a id="l5682"></a>essential word &amp; wisdom, came out of him in the beginning in order to create the world <a id="l5683"></a>&amp; by coming out was begotten into a Son. And it may be presumed that the Emperor <a id="l5684"></a>who presided in the Council, approved the Creed of Eusebius, dictated the ὁμοούσιος, &amp; <a id="l5685"></a>moderated in the whole debate about the  Nicene faith, understood the meaning <a id="l5686"></a>of the Council.</p>
<p id="par631" class="i0">And whilst Hosius was at the head of this Council &amp; in the time of the Councilof Nice influenced   the Emperor <a id="l5687"></a>Constantine the great  &amp; the opinion that the  Son was  <a id="l5689"></a>the only λόγος of God was published to all the Empire by Constantine &amp; confirmed by <a id="l5690"></a>this Council of Serdica: you may thence know  that  Hosius,  was of the same opinion. He beleived therefore with Constantine &amp; Alexander &amp; Eustathius &amp; the Council of Serdica that the λόγος which  was in the beginning &amp; became flesh was the only  word &amp; wisdom of  God the father, the word without which God would be <a id="l5692"></a>ἄσοφος &amp; ἄλογος.</p>


<p id="par634"> The opinion that the son of God was the λόγος προφορικὸς emitted <a id="l5693"></a> before all ages for creating the world &amp; that before this word was emitted the <a id="l5694"></a>Son was potentially in the father as his λόγος ἐνδιάθετος but not yet actually generated into a son, was <a id="l5695"></a>the prevailing opinion among the  learned untill the times of the Council of Nice. This opinion being introduced <a id="l5696"></a>by the  Gnosticks &amp; Platonists &amp; refined by the Cataphrygians &amp; Patripassians, <a id="l5697"></a> spread in the Churches  about an hundred &amp; fifty years together, &amp; then was again refined <a id="l5698"></a>by  Alexander bishop of Alexandria. ffor it being objected that this opinion made    made the father mutable unless the son was generated out of nothing, Alexander rejected it <a id="l5700"></a>   &amp; made the son the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος begotten of his father from all <a id="l5701"></a>eternity. And so far as I can find, he was the first man of note of this opinion. <a id="l5702"></a>ffor his adversaries replied that by  this opinion <a id="l5703"></a>he made the son ἀγένετον unbegotten  &amp; that <a id="l5704"></a>they never before heard of two unbegotten principles . Henceforward there<a id="l5705"></a>fore some continued of opinion that the son was the λόγος προφορικὸς  others <a id="l5706"></a>followed Alexander &amp; became of opinion that the son  was the <a id="l5707"></a>λόγος ἐνδιάθετος.  [The first  taught that the Son was begotten befor all <a id="l5708"></a>ages in order to create the world; the second that he was begotten  from all <a id="l5709"></a>eternity  the father being immutable &amp; never without a son least he should have been at any time ασοφος &amp; αλογος  until the Council of Sirmium in <a id="l5712"></a> censuring Photinus A.C. 351 condemned both these opinions with  this anathema. <a id="l5713"></a>Siquis ἐνδιάθετον ἢ προφορικὸν λόγον internum vel prolativum verbum <a id="l5714"></a>dixerit Dei filium, anathema sit.   And from that time forward these opinions decreased <a id="l5715"></a>&amp; in a few years vanished,  the faith &amp; sentences of that Council  meeting <a id="l5716"></a>with an universal approbation as you have heard above. And so far as I can find <a id="l5717"></a>– – – – ἢ προφορικος.</p>
<p id="par635">And by all these things it is manifest that the original meaning of the article <a id="l5718"></a>of the Creed  <em class="underline">begotten before all ages</em> was that the son was begotten  <a id="l5719"></a>in or a little before the beginning of the ages in order to create the world,  which being but a <a id="l5720"></a>philosophical opinion grounded chiefly upon a misinterpretation <span class="pagenumber-embed" id="p189Ar"> &lt;189Ar&gt; </span> of the words of Solomon Dominus creavit m<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>e init<span class="nb-n">}</span></span>ium viarum suarum in ope<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ra sua<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l5721"></a>must have got into the Creed long after the days of the Apostles &amp; bei<span class="supplied" title="This text has been supplied by the editor"><span class="nb-n">{</span>ing only<span class="nb-n">}</span></span> <a id="l5722"></a>of humane authority, may  by the same authority be rejected</p>

<p id="par636">cataphrigians, seem to have given occasion to their tumults &amp; to the letters of <a id="l5723"></a>Pope Victor. For Tertullian represents that those letters were for <a id="l5724"></a> bringing peace to the Cataphrygian Churches. And before they were disturbed excommunicated &amp; separated the <a id="l5725"></a>bishop of Rome could not write  letters of peace to them separately from <a id="l5726"></a>the  Churches which excommunicated them. He seems therefore to have written <a id="l5727"></a>these letters of peace for supporting the Cataphrygians  &amp; thereby strengthning himself against <a id="l5728"></a>the Churches of Asia who had excommunicated  them &amp; whom he had excommunicated <a id="l5729"></a>for keeping Easter on the Iewish day. And hence forward – – – – – – hereticks</p>

<p id="par638">The  like opinions were propagated by Tertullian in Afric <a id="l5731"></a>Ante omnia, saith he, Deus erat solus . . . . . . . appellamus. And a little after describing <a id="l5732"></a> how God  first created wisdom in the beginning of his ways &amp; <a id="l5733"></a>then generated the son  he adds Nam ut primum Deus <a id="l5734"></a>voluit – – – – – – – – generatus ad effectum. Because the Son is called light,  therefore <a id="l5735"></a>Tertullian represented him generated in the beginning of the creation when God said,  Let there be <a id="l5736"></a>light.</p>

<p id="par641">Origen  who succeeded  Clemens   &amp; whose opinions are recited by Ierome (for his works now extant have been corrected) taught the plurality of worlds &amp; the transmigration <a id="l5772"></a>of souls  that the son was a creature &amp; that all rational  creatures might be changed into one another <a id="l5773"></a> that the sun Moon &amp; stars were animated, that Angels were changed into the <a id="l5774"></a>souls of men &amp; that the soul of our saviour  preexisted   <a id="l5778"></a>&amp;  was that being which was in the form of a God  before he  took upon him the <a id="l5779"></a>form of a  servant.

<p id="par642">While  Tertullian  complains that Praxeas hindred this bishop of Rome from <a id="l5787"></a>bringing peace to the churches of Asia &amp; Phrygia, &amp; implies that these Cataphrygian Churches <a id="l5788"></a>were now in trouble, &amp;  <a id="l5789"></a>&amp; <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> had been newly condemned &amp; excommunicated by the Councils of the Greeks</p>
<span class="pagenumber" id="p190r"> &lt;190r&gt; </span>
<p id="par643">This is enough to shew that as the  Platonists <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> <a id="l5790"></a>the Gnosticks  derived  from the supreme God certain  emissions Ideas,  Splendors, or <span class="gap" title="Text is illegible due to defective copy">{illeg}</span> from <a id="l5791"></a>the supreme God &amp; called them by the names of his attributes, the <a id="l5792"></a>Cataphrygians,  Encratites,  Paulinists &amp; Sabellians  had thence their notion that the Son of God was the <a id="l5794"></a>Platonic λόγος, or the λόγός ἐνδιάθετος the inward reason &amp; wisdom of the father without which he would be <a id="l5795"></a>ἄλογος &amp; ἄσοφος:  so this notion began to creep into the very Church her self in the latter <a id="l5796"></a>part of the second century spread in it all the third and in the fourth overspread it &amp; was the ground   upon which those Bishops proceeded who  repealed the Decree of the <a id="l5798"></a>Council of Antioch  against Paul of Samosat &amp; made his condemned lan<a id="l5799"></a>guage an article of faith. </p>
<p id="par644"> And tho they intended thereby to establish the eternal Deity of Christ [opinion that the <a id="l5803"></a>Son of God was his internal essential λόγος without which  he was ἄσοφος &amp; ἄλο<a id="l5804"></a>γος, :]  yet they did it unskilfully: For any man who with the old heathens &amp; hereticks takes <a id="l5805"></a>the souls of men for rays sparks or particles of the Deity, may subscribe  their Creed without <a id="l5806"></a>beleiving Christ to be more then a mere man.

But by  making <a id="l5813"></a>this new language of Paul of Samosat  an article of faith they fomented <a id="l5814"></a>rather then quieted the divisions  which were then commencing.</p>
<p id="par645">Hitherto the Christian religion arose &amp;  spread by the preaching of the Gospel to poor people without the power of <a id="l5815"></a>the sword, &amp; by its truth, evidence &amp; vertue &amp; the blood of the martyrs prevailed against the power <a id="l5816"></a>of the Iewish nation &amp; that of the heathen Roman Empire.

<p id="par657">1 Paul of Samosat made the Son a part of the father &amp; in that sense con<a id="l5975"></a>substantial to him, that is to his other part  as a branch of a tree is said to be consubstan<a id="l5976"></a>tial to the tree,   viz<sup>t</sup>  not to it self, but to the rest of the tree. In <a id="l5977"></a>opposition to this opinion which was the general philosophy of the <a id="l5978"></a>heathens Cabbalists Gnosticks &amp; Cataphrygians, the Council of Antioch com<a id="l5979"></a>posed of 80 bishops   declared that the λόγος was not <a id="l5980"></a>consubstantial to the father. Their sentence was communicated by circulatory letters to all the <a id="l5981"></a>Churches &amp; the Churches acquiesced in it. And when Paul was being deposed &amp; refused to quit the bishops house <a id="l5982"></a>at Samosat &amp; the Eastern bishops  desired the Emperor Aurelian to remove him <a id="l5983"></a>the Emperor  suspended till he had the opinion also of the bishops of Rome &amp; Italy, &amp; upon <a id="l5984"></a>their letter aginst Paul, removed him.

And after such a sentence there was no room for any following Council to pretend <a id="l6021"></a> tradition for it.   But the Council of Nice  received it by a legislative power <a id="l6026"></a>And this usurpation of divine authority began a new state of the Church.</p>
<p id="par662">Hitherto  the Christian religion arose &amp; spread <a id="l6027"></a>by the preaching of the Gospel to poor people without the power of the <a id="l6028"></a>sword, &amp; by its truth evidence &amp; vertue &amp; the blood of the mar<a id="l6029"></a>tyrs prevailed against the power of the heathen Roman Empire. While <a id="l6030"></a>this Empire  continued heathen it was <a id="l6033"></a>impossible for the Christian reigion to become an Empire. But now that <a id="l6034"></a>which letted is taken out of the way,  &amp; is succeeded by a Christian <a id="l6037"></a>Empire:  &amp; the Christian Emperors begin to Call Councils <a id="l6038"></a>for establishing their own opinions &amp; by consequence to set up a new religion by the power of the sword: these changes  in religion <a id="l6039"></a>are so very considerable, that if the state of the Church under <a id="l6040"></a>the lasting persecution of Dioclesian  &amp; <a id="l6041"></a>his successors (wherein all disputes between the Christians &amp; hereticks <a id="l6042"></a>ceased for a time) be recconed for a fift state, this under the <a id="l6043"></a>first Christian Emperors may be recconed for the sixt.</p>
<p id="par663" class="i0">2 And yet the Bishops of the fourth century established it &amp; made it heresy to oppose <a id="l6044"></a>it.  Nor did they only establish the new word homousios contrary to  the rule <a id="l6045"></a>of holding fast the  form of sound words, &amp; contrary to the tradition of the church declare against Paul of Samosat,  but they established <a id="l6046"></a>also a new doctrine  by that word namely that the Deity com<a id="l6047"></a>prehended two  substances called the father &amp; the son,  one of which arose from the other &amp; was consubstan<a id="l6049"></a>tial to it, being two substances in number &amp; one in nature. The heathens derived all their Gods from one root <a id="l6050"></a>&amp; said that they were all of them but one Iupiter one God: the Christians <a id="l6051"></a>began now to decree that the father &amp; Son were two substances in the <a id="l6052"></a>Deity,  of the same essence or nature one of which arose from the <a id="l6053"></a>other &amp; both were but one God. The Cabbalists &amp; Gnosticks refined the <a id="l6054"></a>doctrine of the heathens &amp; restrained it to  certain numbers of Gods <a id="l6055"></a>&amp; called those Gods by the names of  the powers &amp; attributes of God, the Cataphry<a id="l6056"></a>gians Paulinists &amp; Sabellians refined the doctrine of the  Gnosticks &amp; restrained it <a id="l6057"></a>to the Trinity. The Egyptians reined the doctrine of these hereticks &amp;  to <a id="l6058"></a>avoid divisions  &amp; changes in the substance of the deity, said that the  son  was <a id="l6059"></a> begotten of the father from all eternity.

<p id="par666">The homousian controversy lasted with various success till the death of <a id="l6092"></a>the Emperor Valens &amp; was managed between the Latine Churches &amp; chiefly the Church of Rome on the one hand &amp; the Greek Churches &amp; chiefly the churches of Asia on the other.
